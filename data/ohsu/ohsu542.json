Fifteen patients with isolated splenic vein obstruction, four with portal occlusion and one with isolated inferior mesenteric vein occlusion were studied. Chronic alcoholism was the etiology of the pancreatitis in 18 patients; two patients had a Type IV hyperlipidemia. Four patients with massive hemorrhage from gastric varices were treated with splenectomy. Most patients presented with complaints of chronic pancreatitis, requiring pancreaticojejunostomy to treat the underlying pancreatic disorder. Splenic artery inflow control was obtained preoperatively in six patients and offers a technique that is beneficial in decreasing operative blood loss. The dynamic computerized tomography (CT) scan was a valuable diagnostic tool in identifying splanchnic venous obstruction although selective angiography is required for confirmation of the diagnosis.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Outpatient hemodialysis clinic at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Ten patients on maintenance hemodialysis who had chronic hyperkalemia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received nebulized albuterol therapy (10 mg or 20 mg) or placebo (saline) on three separate occasions, serial measurements of plasma potassium levels, blood pressure, and pulse were then taken for a 2-hour period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULT: Patients had a significant decrease in plasma potassium concentrations that was evident by 30 minutes and sustained for at least 2 hours after albuterol treatment. After the administration of 10- and 20-mg doses of albuterol, the maximal decrease in the plasma potassium levels was 0.62 +/- 0.09 and 0.98 +/- 0.14 mmol/L (SE), respectively. Nebulized saline administration did not produce a significant change in the plasma potassium concentrations. Patients did not develop symptoms or significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate with albuterol treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In the doses used, nebulized albuterol therapy resulted in a prompt and significant decrease in the plasma potassium concentrations in patients on hemodialysis, and caused no adverse cardiovascular effects. This treatment should be considered as an important adjunct for acute treatment of serious hyperkalemia in this population of patients.\r"

There were 5 hypogonadal patients, 9 eugonadal nonvenesected patients, and 8 eugonadal venesected patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients and controls were evaluated by spinal radiography, spinal and forearm bone mineral density estimations, dynamic skeletal histomorphometry, and serum biochemistry. Ten patients (45%; 95% CI, 24% to 68%) had osteoporosis as defined by spinal and forearm bone density measurements. Trabecular bone volumes were significantly reduced in the patients (the difference in means between patients and age-matched controls was 3.9%; CI, 1.3% to 6.7%). No patient had osteomalacia. Hypogonadal men had lower bone mass measurements than eugonadal men (radial bone density: beta coefficient = -20.5; CI, -29.2 to -11.8; trabecular bone volume: beta coefficient = -7.1; CI, -10.8 to -3.3). Osteoid and osteoblastic surfaces and bone formation rates were significantly greater in the eugonadal venesected compared with the eugonadal nonvenesected persons (P less than 0.05 for all measurements). CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease in bone density is seen in idiopathic hemochromatosis, particularly when hypogonadism is present. Low serum free-testosterone concentrations rather than the calciotrophic hormones determine bone mass in this condition.\r"

Generally, the hypertension can be attributed to the abnormal-sized kidney, and nephrectomy of the shrunken kidney or correction of the stenotic artery will result in the normalization of blood pressure. We report eight cases of hypertension in young women shown to have a small kidney by intravenous urography. The abnormal-sized kidney was considered to be due to either agenesis or dysplasia and reflux. Although the diseased kidney was thought to be the cause of the high blood pressure, these patients were unique in that they had a stenosis of the contralateral renal artery of the fibrodysplasia type, which was predominantly localized in the distal part of the artery and frequently extended into the peripheral branches. Successful anatomic correction of the stenotic artery without surgery on the contralateral small kidney resulted in the normalization of blood pressure. This previously unrecognized combination of parenchymal disease of one kidney and renal artery stenosis of the fibrodysplasia type on the contralateral side should be considered in patients with hypertension and a unilateral small kidney. Such recognition could prevent the unnecessary treatment of these patients with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or nephrectomy.\r"

Medical records are being distorted and fashioned to keep clinically important but sensitive personal information about patients from public view. To comply with standards of care and a reimbursement system blind to biologic diversity, medical records are being forced to address only the technical side of care. Until these deficiencies are corrected, our increasing dependence on medical records should be balanced by increasing skepticism about the value of the information they contain.\r"

In the current study, 18 patients with each diagnosis were matched for disease duration, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral symptoms (using the modified Mini-Mental Status [mMMS] examination and the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale [BDRS] ). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was quantified by the 133xenon inhalation technique, and several indices of tissue perfusion were examined. The two variables of primary interest were relative gray-matter relative weight (35% in presenile patients versus 39% in senile patients and healthy control subjects, p = 0.006), with neither perfusion nor disease severity differences between the two dementia samples. This loss of gray matter was significantly related to both severity and duration of disease in the patients with presenile AD, but not in patients with SDAT. These findings lend support ot previous suggestions of greater degenerative process in presenile AD and confirm the need to examine and control age of onset in future investigations of AD. Further, correlation analysis suggests greater proportion of common variance among clinical and physiological indices in presenile AD.\r"

Myokymia, pseudomyotonia (difficulty relaxing after forceful contraction), and ischemia-induced carpal spasm (Trousseau's phenomenon) were not abolished by nerve block distal to the cuff or by intravenous infusion of calcium. Inhalation of oxygen suppressed the pseudomyotonia and Trousseau's phenomenon, but myokymia persisted. Phenytoin abolished all types of abnormal discharges. The morphological abnormality in biopsied short peroneal muscle consisted of intraterminal and ultraterminal sprouting. We postulate that the trigger zone for abnormal discharge in our case is in the distal segment of the intramuscular nerve axon, including the nerve terminal. Hypoxia-sensitive hyperexcitability of the axon membrane might be responsible for the generation of pseudomyotonia and Trousseau's phenomenon, although the mechanism underlying myokymia remains unknown.\r"

  ".W": "In searching for agents effective in treating multiple sclerosis, we studied the effect of a short-acting digitalis, ouabain, on conduction block in an animal model of central nervous system demyelination. The electrogenic sodium/potassium pump, which digitalis specifically inhibits, is responsible for part of the resting membrane potential and also the activity-related membrane hyperpolarization following high-frequency impulses. The latter causes intermittent conduction block in demyelinated fibers. Therefore, digitalis might be expected to reverse demyelinative conduction blocks by reducing the threshold at the blocking node. Somatosensory evoked potentials were monitored in 11 rats with spinal cord demyelination before and after systemic administration of ouabain (0.1-0.6 mg or 0.21-1.58 mg/kg IP). In all rats, slowed conduction velocity of the compound action potential through the lesion was significantly reversed, and failure to transmit high-frequency impulses was improved upon. The amplitude of the cortical somatosensory evoked potentials also increased significantly. Digitalis is a promising therapeutic agent for trial in patients with multiple sclerosis.\r"

Pearson correlation coefficients were computed among a number of olfactory, neurological, and neuropsychological measures obtained from 58 Parkinson's disease patients, including the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, a modified Randt memory test, a reaction time test, a finger-tapping test, ratings of motor and neurological function, and selected verbal and performance subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised. Data from 38 patients with Parkinson's disease who received odor detection threshold testing were also evaluated. The intercorrelation matrix was subjected to a principal components factor analysis which yielded six clear-cut factors: cognitive/memory, gross motor, oral motor, fine motor, olfactory, and tremor. The olfactory factor received strong and nearly exclusive loadings from the olfactory measures (which did not evidence meaningful loadings on any of the other factors). A ten-trial jackknife procedure revealed the factor structure to be stable. Further support of the independence of the olfactory variables from the other measures was provided by multiple regression and canonical correlation analyses. Overall, these findings lend support to the hypothesis that the olfactory disorder of parkinsonism is independent of the cognitive, perceptual-motor, and memory manifestations of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The role of spinal cord injury in the pathogenesis of abnormal motor signs (depressed tone and reflexes) following severe perinatal hypoxia-ischemia was prospectively evaluated by clinical, electrophysiological, and neuropathological examinations in 18 asphyxiated neonates. All infants had an abnormal mental status (lethargy or coma), and seizures were present in 12. Neuromuscular examinations revealed hypotonia or flaccidity and hyporeflexia or areflexia in all infants. Neuropathological examinations of the cerebrum and spinal cord were conducted in the 12 neonates who expired. Cerebral pathological findings included cortical neuronal necrosis in 10 of 12 and subcortical white matter injury in 5 of 12. All infants with coma or seizures displayed diffuse cortical injury, but no injury conformed to a parasagittal \"watershed\" distribution. Spinal cord gray matter displayed prominent ischemic necrosis in 5 patients who were typically flaccid and areflexic. Electromyographic examinations of all 6 survivors were abnormal, consistent with recent injury to the lower motor neuron above the level of the dorsal root ganglion. We conclude that ischemic injury to anterior horn cells within spinal cord gray matter is relatively common among hypotonic-hyporeflexic neonates following severe perinatal hypoxia-ischemia. Although the acute neurological syndrome of neonatal asphyxia is often overshadowed by prominent cerebral signs such as coma and seizures, the motor abnormalities may be partially attributed to concurrent spinal cord injury.\r"

In the present study activated suppressor cell function was assessed in patients with documented progressive disease who, at the time of study, had experienced severe disability (Kurtzke score greater than or equal to 6.5) for at least 2 years. We found that mean suppressor levels were significantly increased in this patient group compared with the suppressor levels in the MS patient group with progressive disease but only moderate disability (Kurtzke score of less than or equal to 6.0 within 2 years of study) (59 +/- 8% vs 19 +/- 7%, respectively, p less than 0.01). The mean value in the latter group was significantly reduced compared with the mean value for normal control subjects (47 +/- 4%, p less than 0.01), a finding consistent with previous reports. The results of this study indicate that suppressor cell function, as measured by our assay system, need not be defective in MS patients who have become severely disabled from the progressive form of the disease. Whether the patients who are now severely disabled from progressive MS passed through a phase of disease associated with the same suppressor defects as found in the progressive patients currently with moderate disability will remain speculative until long-term longitudinal studies are performed.\r"

There is a lack of knowledge about the effect of the presence of HIV on operative risk, about the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on the progression of HIV infection to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and about the risk to the cardiac surgical team of operating on 1 or more HIV carriers. This lack of knowledge is exacerbated by the strict regulations surrounding testing. We polled the board-certified cardiac surgeons in the United States on their willingness to perform open cardiac procedures on HIV carriers and AIDS patients. Fifty-three percent of the surgeons responded. Two thirds of them will operate on HIV carriers who need an urgent cardiac operation but regard the presence of AIDS as a contraindication to cardiopulmonary bypass. This is presumably a medical judgment. Those who will not operate on HIV carriers are apparently motivated by fear rather than moral judgments concerning the patients. Virtually all surgeons want to be able to test \"high-risk\" patients, and a substantial majority would test all patients.\r"

Oxygen free radical scavengers consisted of superoxide dismutase and catalase (100 micrograms/mL) given at the moment of reflow. Extravascular lung water (grams per gram of blood-free dry lobe weight) after reperfusion was 2.75 +/- 0.19, 5.46 +/- 0.60, 4.08 +/- 0.37, 9.43 +/- 0.98, and 6.91 +/- 0.95 for groups 1 through 5, respectively (p less than 0.05, groups 2 through 5 versus group 1; p less than 0.05, group 2 versus group 3 and group 4 versus group 5). Lung tissue lipid peroxidation, measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive material, was 117 +/- 14, 314 +/- 19, and 163 +/- 25 nmol/g dry lobe weight for groups 1, 4, and 5, respectively (p less than 0.05, group 4 versus group 1 and group 4 versus group 5). The data suggest that oxygen free radical scavengers attenuate reperfusion injury after long-term hypothermic lung preservation.\r"

Of the 2,585 patients treated for aortic aneurysm during the past 8 1/2 years, 22 patients had disease conforming to this definition. The aneurysms were located in the ascending aorta in 2 patients, ascending aorta and arch in 5, arch and descending aorta in 1, descending thoracic aorta in 1, separate descending and abdominal aorta in 1, thoracoabdominal aorta in 5, upper abdominal aorta in 6, and infrarenal abdominal aorta in 1. The primary source of infection was the urinary tract in 2 patients, salmonellosis in 4, pneumonia in 3, sub-acute bacterial endocarditis in 2, ear, nose, and throat in 2, cellulitis of the hand in 1, chronic wounds in 2, dental extraction in 1, lumbar disc space infection in 1, septic thrombophlebitis in 1, and generalized febrile illness in 3. The duration of febrile illness ranged from 2 weeks to 1 year. All patients were treated with antibiotics and operation was performed within 24 hours after admission in 11 patients and within one to eight days after admission in 11. Treatment consisted of in situ graft replacement. Appropriate antibiotics were given intravenously for 4 to 6 weeks in patients with positive cultures and continued orally for the rest of the patients' lives. Of the 22 patients, 19 (86%) were early survivors, and all are still alive 3 months to 8 years postoperatively. Only 1 had a recurrent infection, which involved the intervertebral disc space.\r"

Primary therapy included the following: observation; tube thoracostomy; tube thoracostomy with instillation of quinacrine hydrochloride, tetracycline, silver nitrate, or talc; or partial pleurectomy. Complications were minimal in each group. The surgical group did significantly better than all other groups except the group given talc. We conclude that pneumothorax is a late and ominous complication of cystic fibrosis. The primary treatment of pneumothorax should be partial pleurectomy. Talc instillation should be reserved for patients in respiratory failure who are too ill to undergo operation and for the occasional patient in whom surgical intervention fails.\r"

A 5-cm segment of cervical trachea was resected in 6 dogs. One-half of the segment was cryopreserved and stored in liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C for 1 week. The other half was immediately implanted in an abdominal pouch fashioned from the rectus abdominis muscle (control). One week later, the cryopreserved segment was thawed and then implanted in a similar contralateral muscular pouch. Five weeks later, the control and cryopreserved autografts were removed and compared with the in situ trachea. Ciliary beat frequency was assessed by transmitted light technique. Histology was evaluated by light microscopy. Gross anatomy and mucus production were maintained after cryopreservation. Histologically the cryopreserved segment displayed both normal epithelium and smooth muscle cells, but the cartilage was abnormal as characterized by empty lacunae. Mean ciliary beat frequency of in situ, control, and cryopreserved segments was 13.3 +/- 1.8, 13.5 +/- 1.5, and 13.3 +/- 1.1 beats per second (+/- the standard deviation), respectively. We conclude that smooth muscle, epithelium with mucus production, and ciliary function were retained after cryopreservation and reimplantation. Histological changes, however, were suggestive of early cartilage ischemia. These findings support further evaluation of cryopreserved canine tracheal grafts.\r"

  ".W": "Our entire institutional experience with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum (1965 through 1987) included 115 patients, 16 of whom died before surgical intervention. Fifty-six percent of surgical patients (n = 99) had angiographic evidence of right ventricle-coronary arterial connections. The early mortality in the surgical group was 27.2%, and the actuarial survival was 24.7% +/- 6% at 13 years postoperatively. Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of ventriculocoronary connections (p = 0.037), a decreasing ratio between right ventricular and left ventricular pressure at the initial cardiac catheterization (p = 0.007), and lower weight at operation (p = 0.001) were incremental risk factors for postoperative death; the presence of Ebstein's anomaly was an additional risk factor in the overall experience (including patients not surgically treated) (p = 0.01). Nearly all long-term survivors underwent at least one reoperation, including right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction (n = 39) and thromboexclusion of the right ventricle (n = 9). The presence of severe stenosis or interruption of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery system was a uniformly lethal risk factor for patients undergoing these procedures (p = 0.0003). We conclude that surgical procedures that successfully decompress the right ventricle will usually result in biventricular circulation in and long-term survival of patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum not complicated by Ebstein's anomaly or extensive ventriculocoronary connections. Decompression or thromboexclusion of the right ventricle is contraindicated in patients with ventriculocoronary connections and a right ventricle-dependent coronary circulation.\r"

Mean age at operation was 5.6 +/- 6.3 months (range, 1 week to 4 years); 60 were less than 6 months old. There were 65 boys and 28 girls. Operative mortality was 5.4%, and there has been 1 late death. Average follow-up is 45.1 months with 39 followed more than 3 years and 25 followed more than 5 years. Postoperative cardiac catheterization was performed in 43 patients. Right ventricular ejection fraction at rest averaged 0.50 +/- 0.09 and was normal in 26 patients. Response of right ventricular ejection fraction to afterload stress was abnormal in 12 of 14 patients tested. Right ventricular ejection fraction increased normally during exercise in 6 patients, but was abnormal in 15. Mild tricuspid regurgitation was noted in 10 patients. Mild obstruction of the superior vena cava was noted in 4 patients. Baffle leak requiring reoperation occurred in 1 patient. Seventy-two of 80 patients are in sinus rhythm by latest electrocardiogram. Postoperative electrophysiological studies were performed in 34 patients and Holter monitoring was performed in 22. A major arrhythmia occurred in 8 patients: 3 required a pacemaker for junctional rhythm or sinus node dysfunction, 2 have symptomatic or inducible supraventricular tachycardia, 2 have junctional rhythm, and 1 has sick sinus syndrome. Eight additional patients have delayed sinus node recovery time. At last follow-up, 78 children (97.5%) are in New York Heart Association functional class I, and 2 (2.5%) are in class II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Complications occurred in 28 patients (8%) and included wound infection (2.2%), esophageal or gastroplasty tube leak (1.7%), bleeding (1.1%), splenic injury, gastric atony, and crural repair dehiscence (each less than 1%). Follow-up includes personal interview, esophageal manometry, and standard acid reflux testing. The average length of follow-up for 261 patients (74%) followed at least 12 months is 43.8 months. Fifty-eight percent have been followed at least 36 months; 41%, 48 months; and 29%, 60 months or longer. Subjectively, in these 261 patients, reflux has been eliminated in 75%, is mild in 11%, is moderate in 9%, and is severe in 5%. Eight percent have postthoracotomy pain; 3%, early satiety (\"bloats\"); and 1%, postvagotomy diarrhea. Seventeen percent require either periodic or regular esophageal dilations for dysphagia. Objectively, intraesophageal pH studies show good reflux control in 91% and poor reflux control in 9%. Twenty-six patients (10%) have required reoperation for recurrent reflux or dysphagia. These results substantiate satisfactory reflux control using the Collis-Nissen operation in patients at risk for recurrence after standard repairs, but also emphasize that, like other antireflux procedures, the Collis-Nissen operation is not without some degree of postoperative adverse symptoms.\r"

In 10 patients, there were contraindications to using an ipsilateral transthoracic approach. In 10 of the 13 patients, the procedure was successful. Three fistulas recurred; two were quite small, one of them closing spontaneously within 6 months. There were no deaths or clinically significant morbidity related to the transsternal approach.

Since 1983, mitral valve replacement has been performed in 58 patients with obstructive HCM only. Thirty-three female patients (mean age, 47.9 years) and 25 men (mean age, 45.7 years) met criteria 1 through 3 for mitral valve replacement. Patients with intrinsic mitral valve disease (criterion 4) were omitted from this study. All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV and had failed optimal medical therapy. Low-profile mechanical prostheses and bioprostheses were implanted, and the early mortality (less than 30 days or in the hospital) was 8.6% (5/58). Six patients (11.3%) died late, 3 suddenly of probably arrhythmia, 2 of respiratory failure, and 1 of an anticoagulant-related complication. After mitral valve replacement, 40 (83%) of 48 patients surviving operation and returning for evaluation were in functional class I or II, whereas 8 patients were in functional class III. Hemodynamic data obtained 6 months postoperatively showed that pulmonary artery wedge pressure was normal (13.7 +/- 4 mm Hg [+/- standard deviation]), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure had decreased (10.9 +/- 3.4 mm Hg), cardiac index was maintained (2.6 +/- 0.6 L/min/m2), and resting and provoked gradients were unremarkable. Mean follow-up was 24.2 months, actuarial survival was 86% at 3 years, and survival free from thromboembolism, anticoagulant-related complication, reoperation, and congestive heart failure for the same interval was 68%. Complications such as ventricular septal defect and complete heart block are avoided in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement, but device-related and cardiac-related complications can add to the morbidity and mortality in these patients in the long term.\r"

All the wounds were caused by high-velocity missiles. An aggressive approach was utilized. Emergency room thoracotomy was performed in 17 \"lifeless\" patients, 4 of whom survived. Twenty-seven of the 32 patients who were in stable enough condition to undergo initial repair in the operating room survived. Overall survival was 63% (31/49). No intracardiac injuries were diagnosed in survivors, and no cardiac reoperations were required. Careful analysis of the trajectory of the missile or missiles and a portable chest roentgenogram were the most important factors for diagnosing a penetrating wound to the heart and for predicting potential associated injuries.\r"

Our technique consists of dissection of the atrioventricular fat pad of the Kent bundle site using an ultrasonic aspirator and subsequent cryosurgical ablation. For the left parietal and posteroseptal pathways, the apex of the heart has to be retracted upward, but this maneuver was well tolerated in all patients. Moreover, even through a narrow operative field, the ultrasonic aspirator permitted deliberate dissection on the beating heart without injury to major coronary vessels or the atrial wall. In 89% of the patients, operation was performed without the use of heart-lung bypass. All patients were free from preexcitation. With this technique, all Kent bundles except that adjacent to the atrioventricular node can be ablated on the beating heart, usually without heart-lung bypass.\r"

In 9 of these patients, residual tumor was confined to submucosal lymphatics, whereas in the other 36, MRD was found in peribronchial soft tissue. All patients underwent complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Three patients had stage I disease, 3 had stage II, 33 had stage IIIa, 4 had stage IIIb, and 2 had stage IV. Recurrent disease developed in 34 (81%) of the evaluable patients; the recurrence was local in 11 (32%). Median time from operation to diagnosis of local recurrence was 8 months. Sixty percent of the recurrences in the N0 group were local, and only 23% of those in the N2 group were local. Extramucosal MRD is most frequently associated with advanced-stage disease. Postoperative therapy had no effect on the development of recurrent disease. We found no difference in survival between patients whose initial site of recurrence was local as opposed to distant. Median survival after the identification of either local or distant recurrence was 5 months. The finding of extramucosal MRD identifies a subset of patients with a poorer prognosis compared with those with clear resection margins.\r"

  ".W": "Infected median sternotomy is a major complication of cardiac operations. Over a 30-month period, 25 sternal wound infections were treated at a single institution. Twenty-four (2.7%) followed 883 operations with cardiopulmonary bypass, and 1 followed median sternotomy for a noncardiac procedure. Twenty-one of the 25 patients survived to sternal closure. Eighteen patients were treated with delayed primary closure and 3 with pectoralis muscle flaps. Fifteen patients (83%) had an uneventful postoperative course after delayed primary closure. In 2 patients reoperation was required for sternal dehiscence, and in 1 patient a superficial wound infection developed, which was treated with local wound care. In all 18 patients the sternum eventually healed. Criteria for delayed primary closure included clean tissue surfaces without purulent debris, the absence of pockets of purulent drainage, and negative wound cultures obtained 24 hours before closure. The average time from operation to sternal incision and drainage was 11 days (range, five to 59 days). Delayed primary closure was performed nine days after incision and drainage (range, five to 27 days). The average hospital stay was 24 days after sternal incision and drainage (range, nine to 85 days). Cultures from specimens taken at the time of sternal incision and drainage were positive in all patients. Wound cultures were positive at the time of sternal closure in 5 patients. Wound complications developed in 2 of these 5 patients. Delayed primary closure has many of the advantages of classic methods, but fewer complications. Results are comparable, while allowing simpler wound care and less cosmetic deformity. Delayed primary closure is an acceptable alternative in the treatment of sternal wound infections.\r"

The mean gestational age was 35 weeks, and birth weight averaged 2.7 kg. The pneumopericardium developed while the patients were on high-frequency ventilation, and the diagnosis was confirmed with a chest radiogram. Treatment included pericardiocentesis with a needle catheter followed by placement of a 10F to 14F chest tube into the pericardial space. The pneumopericardium resolved in all 8 patients. Three of the newborns died of underlying disease; 5 survived and were discharged from the hospital. Pneumopericardium in the neonate is a life-threatening complication, and appropriate therapy includes drainage with a pericardial tube placed under direct vision.\r"

During the period 1986 through 1987, 38 cryopreserved aortic allografts were placed for right ventricle-pulmonary artery discontinuity. Size of the allografts ranged from 11 to 26 mm (mean size, 19 mm), and age of the patients ranged from 6 weeks to 26 years (mean age, 5 years). Twenty-one patients had primary placement of aortic allografts, and 17 underwent replacement of previous conduits. There were 5 hospital deaths (13%) overall, only 1 among the 10 patients younger than 6 months of age with truncus arteriosus, and none among the 17 patients having conduit replacement. A large conduit could be placed with a low incidence (10.5%) of postoperative hemorrhage related to the conduit. The aortic allograft is our conduit of choice for both conduit replacement and primary repair of right ventricle-pulmonary artery discontinuity.\r"

  ".W": "A 10-year retrospective analysis of 82 patients with suspected thoracic aortic rupture (TAR) due to blunt chest trauma was performed to define which symptoms and signs were helpful in making an early diagnosis. Symptoms and signs associated with TAR included midscapular back pain (in the absence of thoracic spine fracture), unexplained hypotension, upper extremity hypertension, bilateral femoral pulse deficits, and initial chest tube output in excess of 750 mL. Chest roentgenographic signs seen with significantly greater frequency in the 12 patients with TAR than in 70 patients without such rupture included a widened paratracheal stripe (7 patients), deviation of the nasogastric tube or central venous pressure line (5 patients), blurring of the aortic knob (9 patients), abnormal paraspinous stripe (6 patients), and rightward tracheal deviation (5 patients). Mediastinal widening of greater than 8 cm occurred in 11 of the 12 patients with TAR (sensitivity, 92%); its specificity, however, was only 10% (11 true-positive and 63 false-positive results). In patients in hemodynamically stable condition who display these findings, immediate aortography should be considered. The presence of myocardial contusions, intraabdominal injuries, and pelvic fractures also occurred more frequently in patients with TAR. We conclude that a detailed history, physical examination, and chest roentgenography, with rapid progression to aortography in suspicious cases, represent the safest and most reliable approach to patients with TAR.\r"

Cold crystalloid cardioplegic solution (5 degrees C) and hypothermia including topical cooling with slushed ice significantly augmented the coronary flow reduction by acetylcholine at one and two hours after rewarming. Cold Krebs-Henseleit solution (5 degrees C) with hypothermia showed similar effects. However, cardioplegic solution at 37 degrees C did not affect the responsiveness. The coronary flow reduction induced by potassium chloride (60 mmol/L) did not change even after the administration of cold cardioplegic solution (5 degrees C) or cold Krebs-Henseleit solution (5 degrees C), indicating that cooling did not necessarily augment the coronary contractile response generally. It is concluded that cooling and subsequent rewarming can potentiate the contractile response of the coronary artery of the pig to acetylcholine. This suggests that cold cardioplegic solution with hypothermia can promote intraoperative coronary spasm upon activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that CO early after CPB can be reliably predicted by a plot of venous oxygen saturation at various flow rates on CPB, based on in-line monitoring of venous oxygen saturation. In this study, we evaluated a simplified technique for predicting CO with a series of 50 patients on CPB. When CPB weaning began, patients were normothermic, anesthetized, and paralyzed. Venous oxygen saturation and arterial blood flow were recorded. At low pump flow just before termination of CPB, the final venous oxygen saturation was recorded. Assuming a proportional relationship between venous oxygen saturation and arterial blood flow, CO early after CPB was predicted. The simplified CO prediction was compared with the thermodilution CO immediately after CPB. The simplified technique reliably predicted CO early after CPB compared with the thermodilution technique. The simplicity and reliability increase the clinical value of the CO prediction.\r"

One patient (0.8%) returned after two months with recurrent leg symptoms, and venous thrombosis was documented (95% confidence limits, 0.02% to 4.21%). Another patient, who was nonsymptomatic, had an abnormal IPG at the three-month follow-up visit, and venography revealed venous thrombosis.

A single patient relapsed after 28 days with endocarditis. No clinical or microbiological predictors of relapse could be identified, and coexistent medical conditions associated with some degree of immunosuppression did not appear to predispose to relapse. The results of this study and a review of the literature indicate that short-course therapy for uncomplicated S aureus catheter-associated bacteremia has a relapse rate of only 5% to 10% and, therefore, is reasonable therapy for this condition. The majority of relapses are endocarditis and occur within ten weeks after completion of therapy. Close follow-up during this period is essential.\r"

Ipratropium produced a significantly greater improvement than albuterol in the FEV1 at 30 minutes and at 3, 4, and 5 hours and in the forced vital capacity at one through six hours. Fifteen subjects did not demonstrate a 15% improvement and at least a 200-mL increase in the FEV1, 15 minutes after metaproterenol sulfate aerosol. All 15 did improve after ipratropium therapy during the study. Ipratropium was effective significantly longer than albuterol. Subjects with better peak responses to ipratropium had a lower FEV1 percent predicted and a greater pack-year smoking history. In patients with chronic obstructive airway disease, ipratropium produces a longer duration of action than albuterol. It is more effective than albuterol in treating severely obstructed individuals and those not responding to metaproterenol. It is equally effective in treating others.\r"

We implemented a time series design with measures at 12 and six months before, during, and three weeks after the intervention. During the intervention, orders for initial or admission chest roentgenograms decreased by 22% and repeated orders for routine urinalyses, chest roentgenograms, and leukocyte differential counts decreased by 23%, 30%, and 46%, respectively, compared with the six-month preintervention period. Orders for prothrombin time and/or partial thromboplastin time did not fall. After the intervention, most test ordering remained at the intervention level. These preliminary results suggest that this intervention may be effective and not overly costly.\r"

Members of AOA participated in undergraduate medical research and authored papers during medical school significantly more frequently than those who were not members of AOA, planned a major career commitment to research, and planned careers in academic medicine significantly more frequently than those who did not belong to AOA. In contrast, neither religious preference, among students from Catholic, Jewish, or Protestant backgrounds, nor gender differentiated members of AOA from non-AOA members. Among the 15 specialties studied, internal medicine subspecialties and internal medicine attracted the highest proportion of students elected to AOA.\r"

The evaluation of all patients included fiberoptic esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies of the esophagus, otolaryngologic evaluation, technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid aspiration scan, pulmonary function testing, including the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test, and 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring with probes placed 5 and 15 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. Eleven patients had microscopic and macroscopic evidence of proximal esophagitis, 12 patients had laryngeal changes suggestive of aspiration, and 12 patients had abnormal DLCO values. Using multiple regression analysis, the degree of DLCO impairment correlated with the proximal and distal reflux episodes and scores recorded by pH monitoring. There was direct and indirect evidence for proximal gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration in the majority of patients, and a distinct correlation between the severity of reflux and the severity of pulmonary disease. Aggressive antireflux therapy may be helpful in reducing the pulmonary damage due to aspiration in these patients.\r"

A medical record review was conducted to determine whether, in practice, patients were being withdrawn from digoxin. Original indications for digoxin therapy in 163 outpatients were as follows: congestive heart failure (CHF), 50%; supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 23%; CHF and SVT, 10%; and unknown/unclear, 17%. One third of these patients were withdrawn during the 3.5-year study, and 79% remained stable, off digoxin. The most significant predictor of withdrawal was chart indication of reassessment of the need for digoxin. The majority of the patients (68%) were reassessed, and of these, almost half were withdrawn. Physicians appear to be reassessing the need for digoxin therapy, resulting in higher withdrawal rates than previously reported. Results suggest that patients with unclear original indications, a onetime indication, or without clinical evidence of CHF or SVT can be successfully withdrawn.\r"

Serial analyses of pulmonary function measurements were performed with the use of 95% confidence intervals for the percentage response ratios of MDI to UDN. The response to MDI was at least equivalent to that of UDN, and MDI use was associated with no prolongation of hospital stay. Equivalent bronchodilation was achieved with MDI therapy with a lower daily charge for therapy for each patient and less respiratory therapist time. In hospitalized bronchodilator-responsive patients with acute exacerbations of obstructive airway disease, the MDI/spacer combination is the preferred approach when the status of the patient allows its use.\r"

The clinical arrhythmia in these patients (mean age, 61 years) was recurrent ventricular tachycardia in 21 (42%), ventricular fibrillation in three (6%), and symptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 26 (52%). Forty-two (84%) had either ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy. Each patient underwent two short-term drug trials on successive days, receiving either decaffeinated coffee mixed with 200 mg of caffeine or the decaffeinated drink alone. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings were made during the 30-minute control period, the three-hour observation period, and the hourly bicycle exercise tests. Forty-five patients (90%) exhibited ventricular couplets and 29 patients (58%) had salvos of ventricular tachycardia during the testing. However, no differences between the caffeine and decaffeinated trials were observed in either individual or group data on total or repetitive ventricular arrhythmia. Serum catecholamine levels reflected the average increase in serum caffeine level but were not associated with enhanced arrhythmia. We found no evidence that a modest dose of caffeine is arrhythmogenic, even among patients with known life-threatening arrhythmia.\r"

Thirty-nine (35 women and four men) heterosexual contacts of HIV-infected individuals were evaluated by a private infectious diseases practice located in a predominantly white middle-class borough of New York City. Thirty-five of 39 patients were white. The mean household income of all patients was +41,200. Source cases (28 men and four women) were predominantly intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs). After excluding those contacts who were referred because of HIV or hepatitis B virus infection, six of 27 women and one of three men who agreed to be tested were seropositive for HIV. Heterosexual HIV spread is occurring among the middle class, with the predominant sources being IVDAs who do not fit the stereotype of being minorities and lower class. Condoms were not regularly utilized in these relationships even though (1) 23 of 32 contacts became aware of their partners' risk behaviors before the diagnosis of HIV infection, and (2) 23 of 32 IVDAs had attended a methadone program. Such programs could be better utilized to provide HIV-related education since they provide access to many of these IVDAs.\r"

Thirty-one methotrexate-treated patients (33%) and 11 patients (30%) receiving azathioprine experienced a major toxic reaction during the study period. With the case-control method, no predictors of major toxic reactions secondary to azathioprine therapy were found. Sex, drug dosage, response to prior slow-acting antirheumatic drug therapy, concurrent use of salicylates, and age did not predict major toxic reactions secondary to methotrexate treatment, but the methotrexate-treated patients who experienced a major toxic reaction had a significantly greater mean level of blood urea nitrogen at the time of their reaction compared with the control group. Life-table analysis suggested toxic reactions posed a greater risk of treatment termination in methotrexate-treated patients compared with the lack or loss of efficacy. This trend was not apparent in the azathioprine group. The majority of patients in each treatment group (79 for methotrexate and 29 for azathioprine) experienced one or more \"minor\" toxic reactions during the follow-up period.\r"

Central serotonergic responsivity was assessed with a neuroendocrine challenge test in seven male young adults with autistic disorder and in seven age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Binding indexes and physiologic responsivity of the platelet serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptor complex were also measured, as was whole-blood serotonin content. Compared with controls, autistic subjects had substantially blunted prolactin release in response to a 60-mg oral dose of fenfluramine hydrochloride, an indirect serotonin agonist [corrected]. Furthermore, the magnitude of serotonin-amplified platelet aggregation, mediated by the platelet 5-HT2 receptor complex, was reduced in the autistic group, as was the mean number of platelet 5-HT2 receptor sites. Among autistic subjects, fenfluramine-induced prolactin release correlated positively with the serotonin-amplified platelet aggregation response and negatively with whole-blood serotonin content. The results of the present study are compatible with the hypothesis that central serotonergic responsivity is decreased in male autistic young adults. Correlations between central and peripheral serotonergic measures in autistic subjects suggest that systemic alterations in serotonergic function may occur in autism.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous attempts have been made to subdivide populations of alcoholics into homogeneous subgroups. Although no consensus has been reached about the characteristics of these subgroups, a number of classification schemes have identified a subgroup of patients with a high genetic loading for alcoholism, an early onset of alcoholism, a severe course, and coexisting psychiatric problems consisting of aggressive tendencies or criminality. In a recent typology proposed by Cloninger on the basis of adoption studies, this subgroup has been classified as type 2. Another group of patients who were found to differ in their mode of inheritance and clinical characteristics was classified as type 1. The identification of etiologically homogeneous subgroups is easier in studies of adoptees than in studies of individuals who were not adopted. In an attempt to divide alcoholics into two groups of individuals presenting type 1 and type 2 characteristics, we used as a criterion the age of alcoholism onset because type 2 alcoholics as well as their fathers had been found to abuse alcohol at a younger age than type 1 patients. Patients with an onset of alcoholism before their 20th birthday were found to have a significantly higher incidence of paternal alcoholism and were twice as likely to have been incarcerated for crimes involving physical violence. We also observed other features not previously described in this patient subgroup. Patients who started abusing alcohol in their teens were three times as likely to be depressed and four times as likely to have attempted suicide as patients with a later onset of alcohol abuse.\r"

  ".W": "Alcoholics who start abusing alcohol early in life have been found to exhibit problems with mood and aggression control more frequently than patients with a later onset of alcoholism. Because alcohol preference and consumption, as well as mood and aggression regulation, are believed to be influenced by serotonin, relationships between tryptophan availability and mood and aggression regulation were explored in alcoholics. When studied in the entire population, the ratio of tryptophan over other amino acids competing for brain entry (which influences brain serotonin) was found to be lowest one day after cessation of drinking and to increase progressively over the following two to three weeks. When the population was divided into two groups of patients according to whether subjects started abusing alcohol before or after 20 years of age, associations between a low tryptophan ratio and depressive and aggressive tendencies were significant only in the subgroup of patients with an early onset of alcoholism. They were not significant in the rest of the population. Our data are compatible with the interpretation that patients with an early onset of alcoholism have a preexisting serotonin deficit that could manifest itself by an increased alcohol intake early in life and by an increased vulnerability to fluctuations in precursor availability.\r"

In this study, the safety of using a noncrossmatch method for detecting ABO incompatibility was compared with the use of an immediate spin crossmatch (ISCX). This noncrossmatch method consisted of the duplicate ABO testing of blood recipients, the repeated ABO testing of donor blood, and a clerical check to assure that only ABO matched or compatible blood was selected for transfusion. During the one-year study, 7124 patient samples were tested in duplicate for ABO, 26,942 U of red blood cells received from blood collection facilities were retested for ABO, and 23,962 U of blood selected for transfusion based on the noncrossmatch method were tested by an ISCX. ABO test results were concordant for 7115 of 7124 patient samples and discordant for nine. Seven of the nine discordant patient test results were resolved prior to transfusion, and two were inadvertently overlooked. ABO test results were concordant for 26,922 of 26,942 donor units and discordant for 20. Seventeen of the 20 discordant donor test results were resolved prior to transfusion and three were inadvertently overlooked. Two ABO incompatibilities were missed by the noncrossmatch method but were detected by the ISCX. Unless clerical errors can be totally eliminated, it may be safer to retain the ISCX.\r"

The SEM analysis of group D revealed a marked decrease in mucosa-associated microflora compared with groups B and C. Oral neomycin-erythromycin produced a significant quantitative reduction in the colonic mucosa-associated bacterial population, including the potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis group isolates. These mucosa-associated bacteria are a likely source of contamination of the abdominal cavity and wound at the time of colon surgery.\r"

The frequency of metastasis to the lymph nodes increased in proportion to the increase in the extent of penetration by the cancer into the gastric wall. Lymph nodes were not involved in cases of intramucosal carcinoma of the intestinal type, by Lauren's histological classification. By contrast, metastasis to the lymph nodes was observed in cases of intramucosal carcinoma of the diffuse type, by Lauren's classification. We conclude that extensive lymphadenectomy is not mandatory for patients with intramucosal carcinoma of the stomach of the protruded type, since the lymph nodes do not become involved in this type of gastric carcinoma.\r"

In the undifferentiated type, aneuploid lesions were rarely seen at the early stage, but the frequency remarkably increased with invasion into the deeper layers. Nodal involvement and disseminating metastasis were evident with serosal invasion. Analyzed by a multivariate Cox model, DNA ploidy significantly correlated with prognosis. Thus, DNA ploidy is a major determinant of survival, and the behavior of an aneuploid carcinoma is apparently controlled by individual histologic type.\r"

We recommend that lymph nodes for lymphoproliferative disorders and breast tissue for which a malignant diagnosis will not result in an immediate mastectomy not be submitted for frozen-section diagnosis.

A total of 36 patients underwent DPL, 29 before and seven after CT. There were seven false-negative CTs that were clinically significant. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage was positive in three patients who had false-negative CTs. Although overall accuracy was excellent, CT was not reliable in detecting bowel injury. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage was helpful in detecting injuries missed by CT. Most stable patients with moderate or large intraperitoneal fluid collections on CT accompanying solid viscus injury were treated successfully without laparotomy.\r"

Abscesses were intra-abdominal (58%), pelvic/perineal (31%), and retroperitoneal (3%). The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Bacteroides organisms. Abscess symptoms appeared 10 +/- 6 days (mean +/- SEM) after surgery and were drained 8 +/- 8 days after onset of symptoms. Hospital stay from onset of symptoms to discharge was four times greater than that for wound infection. Twenty-seven patients (28%) died. Mortality was increased in patients older than 50 years and in those with renal failure or multiple abscesses. Nosocomial abscesses had a greater morbidity than would infection. Excessive expense and high mortality warrant infection surveillance for both wound infection and ongoing nosocomial abscesses.\r"

One hundred nine patients with breast cancer whose tumors underwent ER analysis and whose lymph node negativity was established histologically were studied. Based on life-table analysis, the overall survival at six years was 92.7% for ER-positive patients, 95.3% for ER-negative patients, and 94.4% for ER-borderline patients. The disease-free survival was 83.3%, 92.8%, and 71.4%, respectively. Survival and disease-free survival were also correlated to menopausal status. The difference in survival was not statistically significant at six years. We conclude that in node-negative primary operable breast cancer, ER status should not be used as a discriminant for adjuvant treatment.\r"

Ten of the 11 patients with positive results had a chronic spastic paraparesis with IgG oligoclonal bands and elevated HTLV-I antibody index. Two of them had been born and were living in France, without HTLV-I risk factors. Evoked potentials were abnormal in the nine tested patients and brain magnetic resonance images in three of seven patients. No improvement was observed with steroid treatment. A retrovirus similar to HTLV-I was isolated in five cases at different periods of the disease. Hypotheses of limited endemic areas in western countries are discussed. Early presence and persistence of HTLV-I suggest that it is the etiologic agent.\r"

In a longitudinal study (n = 47), 16 patients tested positive for HIV-1 antigen in the CSF before (n = 2) or coincident (n = 14) with neurological deterioration. Six patients who tested positive for HIV-1 antigen in the CSF remained neurologically normal for a median duration of follow-up of 11 months. Six of 25 patients who tested negative for HIV-1 antigen in the CSF, subsequently showed neurological deterioration. These data indicate that HIV-1 antigen expression in the CSF is not useful in predicting neurological deterioration.\r"

Six patients were diagnosed with neurosarcoidosis and had electrophoresis of serum and cerebrospinal fluid performed (one patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was later excluded). Cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulins and albumin levels were determined followed by calculation of an IgG index and synthesis rate for each patient. Four (80%) of five patients had elevated IgG indexes and synthesis rates indicative of intrathecal immunoglobulin production. No patient had immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands detected. To date, results of electrophoresis of cerebrospinal fluid in neurosarcoidosis have been reported in 37 patients among four series. Of these, only nine patients (24%) have had either an elevated IgG index or synthesis rate. Our series suggests that intrathecal immunoglobulin production in neurosarcoidosis occurs more frequently than previously described. Furthermore, the elevated indexes and synthesis rates without associated oligoclonal bands suggests a polyclonal immunoglobulin response.\r"

In this group were patients who demonstrated no symptoms, patients who had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, and patients who had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Pearson Product Moment correlations were computed between scores on the three types of measures. The results of this correlational study suggest that cognitive decline in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus is independent of mood and attentional changes.\r"

Peripheral vestibular abnormalities were common on electronystagmographic testing; 42% had unilateral hypoexcitability to caloric stimulation.

However, the occurrence of false-positive (FP) recognition errors was significantly more frequent following left hemisphere injection. In all conditions, no relationship to seizure focus was observed. Patients with FP errors displayed poorer delayed verbal memory during baseline neuropsychological assessment compared with patients without FP errors. Data indicate an inverse relationship between FP errors and recent verbal memory function, and they suggest that impaired memory rather than failure to suppress incorrect responses secondary to poor self-monitoring capacity is responsible for the generation of FP and intrusion errors.\r"

For each patient, neurologists were asked to make a diagnosis according to the McDonald-Halliday classification system of MS. The overall agreement on the diagnosis (MS present or absent) was fair, with no difference noted between the two groups of raters. Considering the six diagnostic levels instead, the reliability was higher for the neurologists participating in the IMS program. These neurologists agreed particularly on the Clinically Definite and Progressive Possible classifications. Complete disagreement was observed for the Early Probable or Latent and Progressive Probable classifications. Because of the different level of agreement on diagnosis, we suggest separate consideration of Clinically Definite and Progressive Probable MS cases in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies of this disease.\r"

Prolongation of the I-III interpeak latency tended to occur with pontine lesions and of the III-V interpeak latency with mesencephalic lesions.

Each patient underwent psychophysical testing, clinical evaluation, and olfactory biopsy. The biopsy specimens were examined ultrastructurally and were found to vary from normal tissues. The overall appearance of the olfactory epithelium in the post-traumatic patient is disrupted and the receptor cells are distorted. Large numbers of axons are located near the basement membrane and can often be found in bundles throughout the epithelium, extending even to the mucosal surface. Olfactory cilia are rarely seen in epithelia obtained from post-traumatic patients. Bald olfactory vesicles, often containing basal bodies, are frequently observed. We postulate that in these cases, the olfactory epithelium regenerates following head trauma and the receptor cells attempt to send axons centrally. However, the cribriform plate has undergone fibrotic healing and the axons are unable to penetrate it and make contact with olfactory bulb neurons.\r"

We also examined whether perception of degraded speech stimuli presented monaurally is related to abnormalities of temporal lobe anatomy and physiology, as we have shown for dichotic performance. Although the patients were impaired on both dichotic and monotic tests, significantly greater impairment was seen on the dichotic test. Our earlier finding of a significant relation between dichotic performance and measures of anterior temporal lobe atrophy and reduced glucose metabolism was replicated, but no significant relation was found between monotic tests and measures to temporal lobe integrity. We conclude that the inability to divide attention, rather than abnormal processing of degraded stimuli per se, is reflected in poor dichotic performance in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type, and that dichotic performance, unlike degraded monotic perception, depends directly on the integrity of temporal cortex in these patients.\r"

This report describes serial radiological and neuropsychological observations in an 18-year-old woman who remained alert and survived this disorder. In association with diencephalic edema seen on computed tomographic scan, she demonstrated disorientation, abulia, attentional deficits, memory loss, and dyscalculia and had impaired IQ scores: the performance scores were worse than the verbal scores. Significant aphasia or sensory loss was absent. She recovered full intellectual capacity in the course of follow-up examinations, and the diencephalic edema seen on the computed tomographic scan resolved despite persistent thrombosis of the straight sinus demonstrable on follow-up digital angiography.\r"

Imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance images of the brain as late as 19 days after the osmotic insult, failed to show pathologically demonstrated demyelinating lesions. Osmotic brain injury induces demyelination in areas of gray-white apposition and, clinically, results in a delayed neurologic deterioration one to three days following the osmotic challenge. Even with magnetic resonance imaging, review of the literature and this experience suggest that osmotic demyelination cannot reliably be imaged during the first month after the insult.\r"

Liver biopsies (n = 101) were performed in all patients before the initiation of MTX therapy, after 2 years, and annually thereafter (mean duration of therapy 53 months). The hepatic histologic grade (5-point scale) in 25 patients increased (worsened) (mean +/- SEM change 0.84 +/- 1.02; P = 0.001). Fibrosis, confirmed by trichrome staining, developed in 14 of 27 patients (52%). A history of alcohol consumption prior to starting MTX correlated significantly with subsequent worsening of the liver biopsy grade (r = 0.55, P = 0.0054). Alcohol intake prior to study entry, elevated weight at MTX initiation, and dose and duration of MTX were significantly associated with the development of fibrosis. Elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase levels at 29-53 months of therapy correlated with the increase in hepatic histologic grade at the 3-year biopsy (r = 0.50, P = 0.04) and 4-year biopsy (r = 0.58, P = 0.03). We conclude that long-term MTX therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients results in a statistically significant worsening in hepatic histologic grade, with common development of mild fibrosis. We do not consider these changes to be clinically significant at present.\r"

The patients showed a selective and varying response to collagens, even after disease had been present for a long time. Changes in the levels of antibody to one collagen type were not necessarily linked to changes in the levels of antibody to other collagens. Only some patients showed a strong correlation between C-reactive protein levels (a measure of disease activity) and antibodies to individual collagens. These findings suggest that rheumatoid arthritis patients produce antibodies to a wide variety of epitopes on these collagen molecules, as a result of different antigenic epitopes being exposed by cartilage degradation at different times throughout the disease.\r"

All 5 SLE patients with concomitant infections had elevated levels of TNF; those with systemic bacterial infection had markedly raised levels (median 260 pg/ml; normal less than 40).

Women with a history of SSc and a concomitant pregnancy completed a detailed questionnaire about the pregnancy. These 48 subjects were age-matched and race-matched to 2 other groups of women (a rheumatoid arthritis group and a control group from the same neighborhood), all of whom had been pregnant at least once. There were no differences in the frequencies of miscarriage or perinatal death in the SSc group compared with the 2 control groups. Preterm births occurred slightly more frequently in both SSc patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients compared with the neighborhood control subjects. There were significantly more small full-term infants born to women with SSc. Interestingly, the increase in preterm births and small full-term babies occurred with equal frequency prior to and after the onset of disease. Although close monitoring for premature birth and intrauterine growth retardation is necessary, we conclude that an uneventful, healthy pregnancy is possible for women with SSc. Those with early, rapidly progressive, diffuse skin thickening should avoid becoming pregnant since, intrinsically, they are at higher risk of developing renal crisis.\r"

  ".W": "While studying knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the first Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we unexpectedly found a protective association between smoking and OA. After adjustment for age, sex, and weight, smokers had a significantly lower rate of OA than did nonsmokers, and heavier smokers were less likely to have the disease than were light smokers. To test this association in a separate study and see if it was due to confounding factors, we looked at the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study, a study of elderly members of the Framingham Heart Study cohort. We evaluated whether the presence of knee OA in 1983-1985 was related to smoking status at the first Framingham examination, 36 years earlier. Subjects who had been smokers at examination 1 had a lower rate of OA (190 of 679, 28%) than did nonsmokers (276 of 736, 37.5%). In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, and weight, heavy smokers had a modestly lower risk of developing knee OA than did nonsmokers (relative risk 0.81). Also, the adjusted risk of severe OA was less in heavy smokers than in nonsmokers (relative risk 0.73). The negative association with OA persisted when we examined the average cigarette consumption over the first 10 years of the Framingham study. Furthermore, after controlling for age, sex, weight, knee injury history, sports activity history, physical activity level, coffee and alcohol consumption, and weight change after examination 1, and after modeling weight and age in a nonlinear manner, smoking remained a significant protector against later knee OA. It appears that smoking or some unidentified factor correlated with smoking modestly protects against the development of knee OA.\r"

Six were treated with oral prednisone and 6 were treated with intraarticular (IA) injections of triamcinolone hexacetonide (TH), at surgery and 4 weeks later. Twelve other operated dogs received no treatment. All dogs were killed 8 weeks postsurgery. Four of 15 normal control dogs received IA TH injections. Operated untreated dogs developed significant cartilage lesions on the femoral condyles and tibial plateaus with prominent osteophytes. Operated dogs treated orally or with IA injections had a significant reduction in osteophyte size. Cartilage erosions on femoral condyles were observed in 25% of the untreated dogs, 8% of the dogs receiving oral prednisone, and none of the dogs receiving IA TH. In both groups of treated dogs, the size of the tibial plateau lesions was significantly reduced compared with the operated untreated dogs. Histologically, corticosteroids significantly reduced the severity of OA structural changes of the cartilage on both medial and lateral femoral condyles and tibial plateaus in operated animals, with the exception of the lateral plateaus of those treated orally. In electron microscopy studies, we found no evidence of increased cell degeneration or death associated with steroids. IA corticosteroids had no deleterious effects on normal articular cartilage. These results indicate that glucocorticoids administered orally or intraarticularly are effective against the development of OA lesions in this model.\r"

Since immune complexes or antineutrophil antibodies are implicated in the pathogenesis of the neutropenia of FS, we also measured both direct and indirect levels of neutrophil-reactive IgG. All 4 patients showed a prompt and dramatic increase in neutrophil counts within 1-2 months of starting MTX therapy. In 3 patients, the symptoms of arthritis also improved; in the fourth patient, arthritis worsened. Recurring infections ceased in 3 patients. Neutrophil-reactive IgG levels, which were elevated in all patients prior to treatment, decreased toward normal while the patients were receiving MTX therapy. We conclude that MTX is effective in treating the neutropenia of FS, in part by lowering neutrophil-reactive IgG.\r"

Quantity-frequency questions, a question about bingeing and the Cage Questions were asked as part of the routine clinical history by the interviewing doctor. In addition, the women were given a further self-completed questionnaire which contained more detailed questions about the usual quantity and frequency of drinking beers, wines and spirits, the Cage Questions again and the Brief Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (BMAST). Asking simple quantity-frequency questions coupled with a question about bingeing during the clinical history was shown to be a quick and efficient method of estimating alcohol intake. Self-administered questionnaires were shown to be unnecessary and although the Cage Questions performed better than the BMAST, these alcoholism screening tests were found to be unreliable in this population in which drinking was generally at a low level.\r"

Alcoholism was diagnosed in 7.9% of patients (14.6% of males and 4.2% females), and this diagnosis became proportionately more common in both sexes during the study period. However, only male alcoholic attempters showed an increase in absolute numbers during the study period, the increase in the proportion of females diagnosed as alcoholic being due to a decline in attempts by non-alcoholics. Particularly high rates of alcoholism were found in the unemployed of both sexes and in housewives. Alcoholic attempters were at greatly increased risk of making repeat attempts. Alcohol consumption shortly before a suicide attempt and as part of the act was extremely common, especially among alcoholics. In addition to increasing the likelihood of an attempt, alcohol may add considerably to the danger of overdoses. Careful investigation of drinking patterns should be an integral part of the assessment of all attempted suicide patients, and there should be close liaison between general hospital services for such patients and local alcoholism treatment services.\r"

Hepatocytes so obtained were significantly more susceptible to AcH-induced inhibition of uridine uptake than hepatocytes from normal liver, alcoholic fatty liver, stable alcoholic cirrhosis and acute viral hepatitis. Benzylamine (an aldehyde buffer) and pyridoxal-5' phosphate (PLP) counteracted the inhibition of uridine uptake by AcH in vitro. We suggest that benzylamine neutralizes AcH toxicity through a Schiff-base condensation with AcH thus taking AcH out of the field of action. PLP protects against AcH-induced inhibition of uridine uptake by probably forming a Schiff base with cellular amino acids thus blocking further condensation of these amino groups with AcH. In this manner, uridine uptake by liver cells for RNA synthesis can proceed without interference by AcH.\r"

  ".W": "In healthy human volunteers we evaluated the effect of a single oral dose of 1 g/kg of alcohol (12.5%, v/v) on the output of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in the gastric juice. In control experiments performed at intervals of 5-8 days, the subjects received the identical volume of water. Ninety minutes after the ingestion of alcohol, or water, first the basal secretion and subsequently the secretion after injection of pentagastrin (6 micrograms/kg, i.m.) were collected over periods of 60 min. The concentrations of the three prostaglandins were determined by radio-immunoassay. After ingestion of alcohol, the volume of gastric juice in response to pentagastrin stimulation was reduced by 24.6%, as compared with the control period. Ingestion of alcohol led to a significant reduction in the concentration of prostaglandin E2 (-42.7%) after stimulation with pentagastrin. The prostaglandin E2 output per hour was markedly inhibited by the ingestion of alcohol, both in the basal period (-47%) and after stimulation with pentagastrin (-55%). While stimulation with pentagastrin did not influence the secretion of PGE2 or PGF2 alpha, the output of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha increased appreciably (+88%) after the administration of pentagastrin. Alcohol also significantly (-28%) inhibited the secretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the period following the administration of pentagastrin. It is supposed that the inhibition of the secretion of prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha by acute alcohol ingestion, might be of significance for the development of alcohol-induced mucosal damage in the stomach.\r"

Each subject was questioned about his or her consumption of alcoholic drinks and a blood sample taken to measure the biological indicators of chronic alcohol consumption. The resulting mean consumption has permitted Guadeloupeans to be classed among the world's foremost consumers of alcohol. For almost half of the adult population, this consumption takes place on a daily basis and therefore constitutes part of everyday life. The patterns of alcohol consumption are linked to sex, age, level of education, employment and socio-professional categories. The heavy-drinking man tends to be elderly, has a low level of education and is an agricultural worker; his consumption is based on rum. The woman is middle-aged and not working; her consumption is based on wine. These stated characteristics permit the setting up of tailored prevention programs.\r"

The survey showed considerable variation in the intensity of treatment received; overall the cohort reduced their alcohol consumption substantially (particularly those who received more intensive treatment) and believed their drinking problem to be much less serious. Patient (and staff) views of the various treatment options are presented and discussed. Although staff and patients differed substantially in their views both groups showed little support for the involvement of relatives in treatment.\r"

Two hundred twenty-eight charts were reviewed for demographic information, circumstance of injury, complaints and physical findings referable to the cervical spine, presenting level of consciousness, severity of head injury, and cervical spine radiographic findings. Only three patients were found to have cervical spine injuries, for an incidence of 1.7%. Of the 122 alert and asymptomatic patients, none had cervical spine injury. The patient population was defined, yet the very low incidence of cervical spine injuries associated with blunt head trauma in this study precludes any identification of predictors. Nevertheless, the results suggest that alert and asymptomatic patients can be spared cervical spine radiography.\r"

Volunteers (n = 146), recruited from a variety of settings, included security personnel and administrative staff from large corporate centers, supervisors from senior care and exercise facilities, and employees in high-rise office buildings. Seven sites for 14 AEDs were recruited. In a single, two-hour class, participants learned to identify and respond to cardiac arrest, to notify emergency personnel, to retrieve and attach the semiautomatic (shock advisory) AED, and to respond to instructions presented on the display screen of the device. A skills check list was used to grade each student on performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, operation of the device, and time required to deliver an electric countershock. Retesting was performed one or more times after initial training to assess skill retention. The study lasted 1 year. All age groups, both sexes, and each responder type easily learned to operate the AED, with a trend for lower performance scores in people aged greater than 60 years. Performance time and skills declined significantly after initial training, but returned to satisfactory levels after one retraining session and were even higher after two retraining sessions. With retesting, errors that would have prevented delivery of countershocks to patients in ventricular fibrillation were rare (six of 146 tests, 4%). During the year of this study only three cardiac arrests occurred in the study sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ambulatory patients frequently ingest liquids or smoke just before temperature measurement. The change in body temperature measurements over time following ingestion of ice water, hot water, and smoking were investigated. Twenty-two healthy, afebrile study subjects sequentially ingested temperature-controlled water and smoked a cigarette. Simultaneous oral and auditory canal temperatures were measured over 15 minutes following ingestion. Auditory canal temperatures were obtained with an infrared detection probe; we designated this process a tympanic membrane-derived (TMD) temperature. To determine the correlation between rectal and TMD temperatures, 100 patients had simultaneous measurements at both sites. Mean initial temperatures were rectal, 37.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C (mean +/- S.D.); oral, 36.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C; and TMD, 37.4 +/- 0.4 degrees C. Maximal mean oral temperature change was greatest at 1.5 minutes after hot, +0.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C, and cold, -1.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C, water. This change was statistically significant for seven minutes at the 95% confidence level (analysis of variance test with Dunnett's multiple range test for significance). There was no significant change in the TMD temperature with any ingestion. The Pearson correlation coefficient for 107 pairs of rectal and TMD temperatures, r = 0.90 (P less than .001), was excellent. It was concluded that hot and cold liquids significantly influence oral temperature measurement for seven to nine minutes following ingestion. TMD temperature is unaffected by liquid ingestion and may allow accurate measurement of body temperature. Further studies are needed to determine the accuracy of TMD temperature over a wide range of body temperature in diverse clinical settings.\r"

Rectal administration of diazepam is easily accomplished during status epilepticus. Five cases in which diazepam administered in the rectal lumen stopped seizure activity are reported. Rectal diazepam appears to be safe and efficacious. It should be considered as an alternate to intravenous therapy when immediate vascular access is delayed. Rectal diazepam may have great benefit in the prehospital setting.\r"

Cardiacneurovegetative function was investigated by evaluations of these parameters: systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, skin conductance, and muscular contraction. These measurements were taken before and after psychological stress (mathematical, Sacks' incomplete sentences, electrical, auditory) and after physical stress (cold, hand grip, head-up tilt, lying, and standing). The results showed a significant difference of the psychophysiologic profiles among the three groups. On the contrary, the cardiovascular variables were not very sensitive or well-discriminating, especially when response amplitude was considered. In conclusion we propose the hypothesis that identification of the psychophysiologic profile in certain individuals may be a better marker for future development of hypertension in subjects with a genetic risk.\r"

It then examines the advantages offered by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. It is shown that when performed intra-arterially this approach may be useful in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. However, its wider use as a means to better discriminate between normotensive and borderline or mild hypertensive subjects should not yet be advocated because information on normalcy of ambulatory blood pressure values is limited. Furthermore, although target organ damage of hypertension correlates more closely with 24-hour or day-time blood pressure mean than with sphygmomanometric values, there is insufficient prospective evidence that ambulatory blood pressure is prognostically superior to cuff blood pressure. Finally, noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ie, the only approach suitable for clinical practice) is not accurate because of the relatively large number of artifactual readings and their limited correspondence to intra-arterial values.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of blood pressure recovery curves after submaximal exercise in apparently normotensive young adults as an early predictor for hypertension. Twenty-six college age males in 1977, with normal blood pressures at rest, were given the Harvard Step Test and postexercise blood pressures were recorded. Criteria were set that differentiated a hypertensive from a normotensive response to exercise. In 1987, these individuals were contacted regarding their blood pressure status. Nine out of ten subjects who demonstrated a hypertensive response to exercise in 1977, now have been given the diagnosis of hypertension. Eleven out of twelve subjects who demonstrated a normotensive response to exercise in 1977, now are still considered to be normotensive. A proposed hypothesis is that during the course of this disease, exercise can unmask hypertension in subjects who have the potential for developing hypertension but currently have a normal resting blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "To assess left ventricular (LV) functional and structural changes associated with the reduction of blood pressure (BP) values during nicardipine administration (60 mg daily, for two months), 17 hypertensive patients were studied by M-mode echocardiography, according to a double-blind design (11 with nicardipine and six with placebo). Decrease in BP induced by nicardipine was associated with decrease in myocardial afterload (end-systolic stress) (P less than .002) and improvement of systolic function (fractional shortening) (P less than .02), without changes in inotropic state (assessed by systolic BP/end-systolic dimension/posterior wall thickness ratio). At the end of trial, a 5% reduction was found in LV mass (P less than .002), whereas relative wall thickness did not change. Diastolic phase (assessed by relaxation time index, and the slope of EF tract of the anterior mitral valve leaflet) was improved (.01 less than P less than .001). Patients with concentric and eccentric hypertrophy were separately considered. Relaxation time index and fractional shortening were significantly improved only in patients with concentric hypertrophy (P less than .01), whereas in the other ones the effect of treatment was variable. These differences were probably due to different effects on preload in the two LV hemodynamic patterns. Thus, nicardipine shows powerful effects on cardiac mechanics in systemic hypertension, but these effects are different according to LV anatomic pattern. Only in the presence of concentric hypertrophy is it possible to foresee the improvement of LV function; LV hypertrophy can be also reduced in concentric hypertrophy, but in the short term the reduction is too small to assume pathophysiologic significance.\r"

In the present study, spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) pups fostered at birth to high calcium (2%) SHR dams developed significantly lower mean arterial pressures by 28 days of age than pups fostered to low calcium (0.1%) dams (93.7 v 107.7 mm Hg, P less than .01). To determine whether BP differences were due to milk ingestion or to late lactational solid diet consumption, a second experiment was performed. Pups were fostered at birth to medium calcium (1.0%) dams and weaned at 21 days to one of three calcium diets. Blood pressures were determined at 28 days after birth. Pups weaned to the high diet at 21 days had lower pressures at 28 days than pups weaned to the low diet (94.2 v 108.3, P less than .01), suggesting that the pressure variations in the first experiment were due primarily to solid food consumption by the pups late in the suckling period. This rapid BP alteration suggests that neonatal SHR have an enhanced susceptibility to the pressure effects of dietary calcium.\r"

Insulin infusion (0.5 or 1.0 mU/kg/min, IV), with plasma glucose held constant by IV glucose infusion, for seven to 28 days raised plasma insulin by five- to ten-fold, but did not significantly change MAP in dogs with reduced kidney mass that were maintained on high sodium intake. In dogs infused with ANG II to cause mild hypertension, insulin for 28 days did not potentiate the hypertension. Insulin infusion did, however, cause modest sodium retention during the first few days of infusion. These findings suggest that additional factors besides hyperinsulinemia per se are responsible for obesity-associated hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that red blood cell Li/Na exchange, also called countertransport (Li/Na CTT) is increased in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) with clinical or subclinical nephropathy and elevated blood pressure. Because recent experimental evidence confirms that red cell Li/Na CTT is a mode of functioning of the Na/H exchange (Na/H CTT), we have measured both transport modes in 23 IDDM (16 hypertensive and seven normotensive) and in eight normotensive controls with normal glucose tolerance. Na/H and Li/Na CTT were significantly increased in hypertensive compared to normotensive diabetics and controls. Na/H CTT was 78 +/- 28 mmol/L cell/h in hypertensive IDDM, 50 +/- 21 in normotensive IDDM, and 55 +/- 24 in the controls. Li/Na CTT was 0.37 +/- 0.13 mmol/L cell/h, 0.27 +/- 0.10, and 0.25 +/- 0.11, respectively. Na/H and Li/Na CTT were significantly correlated (r = .38, P less than .05). The proximal tubule sodium reabsorption, measured as the fractional Li+ reabsorption, was significantly correlated to red cell Na/H CTT (r = .38, n = 29, P less than .05), but not to the Li/Na CTT (r = .21, n = 29). In conclusion this work confirms that Na/H and Li/Na CTT are function modes of the same transporter and that an increased activity of Na/H CTT might play a role in the blood pressure increase in IDDM.\r"

To ascertain whether NaCl can induce a rise in PTH and thereby raise intracellular calcium, five adult males were infused with normal saline, and plasma was analyzed for intact PTH and erythrocytes for intracellular calcium at 15-minute intervals. Saline infusion caused a significant increase in PTH within 15 minutes and in intracellular calcium within 30 minutes. To further demonstrate that PTH was directly responsible for the increased intracellular calcium, erythrocyte suspensions were incubated with PTH, and the PTH caused significant, sustained elevations in erythrocyte total intracellular calcium. These data indicate that NaCl-induced increases in vascular resistance may result, in part, from PTH-induced increases in intracellular calcium.\r"

In a masked fashion we determined the activity of galactokinase (GK) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GPUT) in these patients as well as on 53 age matched controls. With respect to GK no cataract patient had an enzyme level of less than 2 standard deviations below the control mean. However, 3 of 45 (6.7%) patients in the cataract group had a GPUT level less than 2 standard deviations below the mean for controls, and were presumably heterozygotes for this enzyme. In comparison with the expected population rate of 0.8% this is highly significant (p = 0.006). Abnormalities in galactose pathway enzymes may therefore predispose to development of presenile cataracts. In affected people there is a possibility of treating these patients clinically by dietary restriction of dairy products or by using aldose reductase inhibitors to prevent or reverse cataract formation.\r"

The incidence of this condition after cataract surgery was 0.12%, decreasing to 0.08% over the latter decade. 82% of postsurgical patients with epithelial downgrowth presented to the ophthalmologist within one year following surgery, commonly complaining of decreasing visual acuity, red eye, and pain. The most common presenting signs of epithelial downgrowth were retrocorneal membrane, which was seen in 45% of patients, glaucoma in 43%, corneal oedema in 21%, and a positive Seidel test in 23%. We found that a variety of conditions predispose to epithelial downgrowth but that no one factor was present in all cases. Damage to the underlying endothelium, corneal stromal vascularisation, and stromal downgrowth appeared to be important events not emphasised in prior studies. The angle was partially or totally closed in 87% of enucleation specimens. Patients treated surgically underwent fewer enucleations than those treated medically or not treated.\r"

After extensive virological studies the virus turned out to be a rabies-related virus, closely resembling the Duvenhage virus isolated from bats in South Africa in 1980. By light microscopy focal chronic inflammatory infiltration of the ciliary body and of the choroid was found. PAS-positive exudate was seen in the subretinal and in the outer plexiform layers of the retina, and retinal veins showed endothelial damage and perivascular inflammation. Many of the retinal ganglion cells were destroyed. The presence of rabies-related viral antigen in the retinal ganglion cells was shown by positive cytoplasmic immunofluorescence, though electron microscopy failed to identify definite viral structures in the retina. By immunohistochemistry glial fibrillary acidic protein was observed in the Muller's cells, which are normally negative for this antigen but express it as a reactive change when the retina is damaged. Synaptophysin, a constituent of presynaptic vesicles of normal retinal neurons, was not detected in the retina.\r"

Southern blot analysis using probes of the bcr region, demonstrated a bcr break-point in all four patients. In situ hybridization with bcr, c-abl, and c-sis probes showed unusual hybridization sites for 5'-bcr and c-abl indicating complex chromosomal rearrangements affecting three different chromosomes in the four patients investigated. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by hybridization to oligonucleotide probes specific for the bcr-abl fusion region, the expression of a chimeric bcr-abl mRNA was detected. In these patients we demonstrated that (a) CML with a breakpoint in the bcr region without cytogenetically detectable Ph chromosome is characterized by the same genomic recombination of 5'-bcr and c-abl as CML with standard Ph translocation and (b) unusual localization of 5'-bcr and c-abl sequences caused by complex Ph translocation does not interfere with transcription of the bcr-abl fusion gene.\r"

  ".W": "Cloning and sequencing of the enhancer 3' of the A gamma globin gene of a particularly low G gamma and HbF sickle cell anemia (SCA) patient unexpectedly revealed three base changes (T----C, C----A, and A----G at sites +2285, +2460, and +2676) previously associated with the Seattle-type HPFH, thus leading the authors to suspect that the three mutations were polymorphic. The determination of the incidence of the mutations among various ethnic groups allowed the authors to conclude that this is a widely spread polymorphism, thus excluding any role of these base changes in the determination of the hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) phenotype. The origin of these three mutations is not clear because they appear linked, and the same bases (C, A, G) are found in homologous position in the 3' of the normal G gamma gene. As C, A, G at positions +2285, +2460, and +2676 are found with a 100% frequency in African SS patients and presumably among normal Africans (to explain the extremely high frequency among normal American blacks), it is likely that this was the sequence preceding the division of races. The presence of T, C, and A at the same positions apparently occurred after the divergence between blacks and the other races, that is, within the last 1 million years.\r"

  ".W": "Persistent thrombocytopenia after allogeneic marrow transplantation is associated with poor patient survival. To identify the mechanisms of the thrombocytopenia, we studied platelet and fibrinogen kinetics and antiplatelet antibodies in 20 patients between 60 and 649 days (median 90) after transplantation. Seventeen patients had isolated thrombocytopenia (less than 100 X 10(9) platelets/L): the marrow cellularity was normal in five patients and slightly reduced in 12, and there was no discrepancy between thrombopoiesis and myeloerythropoiesis. Three patients had pancytopenia following marrow graft rejection (two) and relapse of leukemia (one). Only three patients had evidence of increased platelet production, indicating that in most cases there is a poor marrow response to thrombocytopenia early after marrow grafting. There was no correlation between platelet count and splenic pooling, suggesting that hypersplenism was an unlikely mechanism of the thrombocytopenia. Although there was a direct relationship between platelet count and platelet survival, the reduction in platelet survival was greater than what could be explained by the fixed platelet removal found in thrombocytopenic patients; this suggests increased platelet destruction. Seven patients had intercurrent infections that reduced both platelet and fibrinogen survivals. In addition, platelet antibodies bound to autologous or marrow donor platelets were present in five of the 12 patients studied. Patients with antiplatelet antibodies had lower platelet counts (30 +/- 10 X 10(9)/L v. 49.1 +/- 28.7 X 10(9)/L, P less than 0.05) and platelet survivals (1.32 +/- 0.92 days v. 3.58 +/- 2.02 days, P less than 0.05) than patients without antiplatelet antibodies. Furthermore, platelet-bound autoantibodies were present in five of six patients with grade II-IV acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but were not present in six patients free of GVHD (P less than 0.01). We conclude that persistent thrombocytopenia after marrow transplantation is most often secondary to increased platelet destruction mediated by multiple mechanisms and that platelet autoantibodies are found in patients with acute or chronic GVHD.\r"

  ".U": "89150435\r", 
  ".W": "Laser photoradiation therapy was tested in an in vitro model for its efficacy in the elimination of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. Results show that at 31.2 J/cm2 of laser light in the presence of 20 micrograms/mL of merocyanine 540 (MC540) there was greater than 5 log reduction in Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi) cells. Similar tumor cell kill was obtained for leukemia (HL-60) cells at a laser light dose of 93.6 J/cm2. However, to obtain the same efficiency of killing for histiocytic lymphoma (U-937) cells, a higher dose of MC540 (25 micrograms/mL) was required. Clonogenic tumor stem cell colony formation was reduced by greater than 5 logs after laser photoradiation therapy. Under identical conditions for each cell line the percent survival for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM, 45.9%, 40%, 17.5%), granulocyte/erythroid/macrophage/megakaryocyte (GEMM, 40.1%, 20.1%, 11.5%), colony-forming units (CFU-C, 16.2%, 9.1%, 1.8%), and erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E, 33.4%, 17.8%, 3.9%) was significantly higher than the tumor cells. Mixing of gamma ray-irradiated normal marrow cells with tumor cells (1:1 and 10:1 ratio) did not interfere with the elimination of tumor cells. The effect of highly purified recombinant interferon alpha (rIFN) on laser photoradiation therapy of tumor cells was also investigated. In the presence of rIFN (30 to 3,000 U/mL), the viability of leukemic cells was observed to increase from 0% to 1.5% with a concurrent decrease in membrane polarization, suggesting an increase in fluidity of cell membrane in response to rIFN. However, at higher doses of rIFN (6,000 to 12,000 U/mL) this phenomenon was not observed. The viability of lymphoma cells remained unaffected at all doses of rIFN tested. These results may have therapeutic relevance in patients undergoing interferon treatment who require bone marrow transplantation, as the complete elimination of tumor cells by marrow-purging procedures may be hampered by this increased survival in the presence of interferon.\r"

After gene transfer the cells were returned to the donor fetus. The lambs were examined after birth for the presence of a functioning Neo R gene. Of ten analyzable animals, six were positive for G418 resistant progenitor cells (CFU-Mix, CFU-C, BFU-E, CFU-E). Two animals were studied for extended periods of time: 8 and 24 months. Each has demonstrated a pattern wherein positive periods are interspersed with times when there were no detectable G418-resistant cells. We conclude that retroviral-mediated gene transfer can be used to insert genes into early progenitor cells of fetal sheep in utero and that the animals can continue to demonstrate blood cells expressing the gene for more than 2 years after birth. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.\r"

In most families with PCT, URO-D mRNA levels are normal but both catalytic activity and immunologic reactivity of URO-D are half normal. We have cloned and sequenced 8 URO-D cDNA transcripts derived from a pedigree member with familial PCT. Three of the cDNAs had sequences encoding normal URO-D but five cDNA's contained a point mutation resulting in a gly----val substitution at amino acid position 281. An oligonucleotide probe complementary to the mutant sequence hybridized to DNA from affected individuals within the pedigree, but not to DNA from normal individuals. Measurements of pulse labeled URO-D in Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocytes indicated that the mutant protein has a half-life in vivo of less than four hours. In vitro measurements utilizing labeled URO-Ds generated in a reticulocyte lysate system revealed a 12-hour half-life for the mutant protein compared with a 102-hour half-life for normal URO-D. This is the first URO-D mutation to be characterized in a pedigree with familial PCT. This mutation was not detected in affected individuals from seven other PCT pedigrees, suggesting that PCT can result from different mutations.\r"

HCCM inhibited specially the growth of rG-CSF responding stem cells. The hairy cell-derived colony inhibitory factor from HCCM was nondialyzable, fairly stable to heat treatment, and trypsin sensitive. Its maximal inhibitory activity against granulopoiesis was observed in the fractions of 5,000 to 6,000 daltons. Moreover HCCM inhibited CFU-E colony formation but not BFU-E. These results indicate that hairy cells produce a factor that inhibits granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis in vitro. This factor may play a role in neutropenia and anemia observed in HCL.\r"

The deletion extends from 485 bp 5' to the mRNA CAP site to the middle of the second intervening sequence. This deletion, together with three others previously described that remove the 5' end of the beta gene but leave the delta gene intact, are all associated with unusually high levels of Hb A2 in the heterozygous state.\r"

  ".W": "Activin, also named FSH-releasing protein, was previously shown to induce hemoglobin accumulation in K562 cells and potentiate the proliferation and differentiation of CFU-E in human bone marrow cultures. Present studies indicate that the potentiation effect of activin is lineage specific. In addition to CFU-E, activin caused an increase in the colony formation of BFU-E from either bone marrow or peripheral blood. It had little effect on the colony formation of CFU-GM and the mixed colonies from CFU-GEMM. In serum-depleted culture, the effect of activin was shown to be dose-dependent with doses effective at picomolar concentrations. The potentiation effect of activin was exerted indirectly through mediation of both monocytes and T lymphocytes. Activin was also found to increase specifically the proportion of DNA-synthesizing erythroid progenitors from both bone marrow and peripheral blood. It had little effect on DNA synthesis in CFU-GM and in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. Addition of the monocytes or T lymphocytes to their respective depleted subpopulations of mononuclear cells reconstituted the enhancing effect of activin on the colony formation and DNA synthesis of erythroid progenitors. These results strongly suggest a specific role of activin in potentiating the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in vitro.\r"

In one method, everted segments of de-endothelialized vessels were mounted in an annular perfusion chamber and the subendothelial surface was exposed to nonanticoagulated human blood under controlled flow. Procoagulant activity was assessed by measuring fibrin deposition on subendothelium and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) levels in post chamber blood. Both fibrin deposition and FPA were decreased with rabbit vessel segments exposed (at a shear rate of 650 seconds-1) to blood from patients with factor VII deficiency and with umbilical artery segments (at shear rates of 90 to 180 seconds-1) that had been pretreated with a monoclonal antibody to human tissue factor. In a second method, everted umbilical artery segments were mounted on a stir bar and the subendothelial surface was exposed, with stirring, to plasma or purified coagulation factors. The capacity of the surface to clot plasma on addition of calcium was inhibited by the antibody to tissue factor. The surface also activated purified 3H-factor X in the presence of factor VIIa, but not in its absence, and this surface property was almost entirely eliminated by pretreating the vessel segments with antitissue factor. Tissue factor activity in subendothelium could play a role in both the arrest of bleeding and in promoting the formation of thrombi at sites of vascular injury.\r"

Preincubation of 125I-labeled thrombospondin with 30 mmol/L lysine was without effect in the binding of thrombospondin to immobilized plasminogen; preincubation of 125I-labeled plasminogen with 30 mmol/L lysine, on the other hand, significantly reduced the binding of plasminogen to immobilized thrombospondin, suggesting that the interaction of thrombospondin with plasminogen is not the direct result of the lysine binding sites of plasminogen. Arginine and benzamidine, ligands known to specifically bind to the kringle 5 domain of plasminogen, blocked the binding of thrombospondin to plasminogen. Limited elastase proteolysis of plasminogen and plasmin resulted in the generation of two distinct thrombospondin binding domains, one of which was retained on lysine-agarose. The isolation and amino-terminal analysis of these domains following elastase proteolysis of plasminogen identified them, respectively, as a domain containing kringle structures 4 and 5 and plasmin and the other domain consisting of kringle 5-plasmin. A 16-residue synthetic peptide, which represents the amino acids linking kringle 4 to kringle 5 (residues 435-450 of native plasminogen), was without effect in either binding to thrombospondin or blocking the binding of thrombospondin to plasminogen. Plasminogen, therefore, possesses a single thrombospondin interactive site that is independent of, but influenced by, the lysine binding site containing kringle structures and most likely is located within the kringle 5 domain.\r"

The minipig ureter was dilated from its normal calibre of 4 F to 10 F, and 100 ml of sterile or infected saline were then introduced from a height of 60 cm under gravity. One week after irrigation and dilatation the ipsilateral kidney was either functioning less than 10% or there was an obstructive nephropathy. Histology at 3 months suggested that extravasation of infected irrigating fluid was the most likely cause of ureteric stricture formation.\r"

In 2 cases this was due to infection and erosion of the vaginal sutures; in 4 cases failure was ascribed to a small capacity bladder and \"pipe-stem\" urethra. In the remaining 6 unsuccessful cases the Stamey sutures had cut through flimsy endopelvic fascia. It was concluded that endoscopic bladder neck suspension has advantages over colposuspension in terms of reduced dissection and hospital stay, but its success rate is lower than originally reported. Failures due to suture infection and buttress displacement may be avoided by not using Dacron and, instead, by picking up vaginal subdermis with nylon sutures--the same tissue used to provide support in a Burch colposuspension.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the function of the intestinal segments used to replace the bladder after cystoprostato-vesiculectomy. The series included 30 patients, 10 of whom underwent clinical, radiological, urodynamic and electromanometric investigations. Seven patients had an ileocaeco-urethrostomy (ICUS) and 3 had an ileo-urethrostomy with a reservoir (IR). The results were good in all patients and there was no sign of tumour recurrence. All were completely continent during the day but during the night only those who observed the 2-h intervals between voiding were continent. The radiological findings for 1 patient showed grade I asymptomatic vesicoureteric reflux. In all cases, periodic pressure waves were observed during electrocystomanometric tests at basal levels, with the IR patients showing waves higher in frequency and lower in amplitude. Prostigmin induced a significant variation in motor activity in IR patients only. The urodynamic tracings showed an almost physiological flow in both groups. Cystomanometry revealed good compliance in both types of new bladders. The height and width of contraction waves during filling was greater in ICUS than in IR patients. Good perineal sphincteric activity was demonstrated by electromyography. Low passive resistance was indicated by the urethral pressure profile. Preliminary analysis of data indicated good functional micturition and renal function in both ICUS and IR patients. Slight differences were found between the two intestinal segments used for bladder replacement.\r"

  ".W": "At the beginning of this century it was realised that peristalsis would cause incontinence if bowel was used for augmentation or substitution of the bladder. Trans-section of the antimesenteric border and cross-folding of the intestinal segments (Goodwin's cup-patch technique) is an efficient means of solving this problem and has been successfully used in the Kock pouch. We anastomosed the ileal low pressure reservoir to the membranous urethra in 22 male patients following radical cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. The mean observation time was 16 months (range 3-36). The capacity of the bladder substitute increased with time, the average being 450 ml after 6 months. In the first 4 patients with a short (2-5 cm) intestinal segment between the pouch and the urethra, micturition was prolonged, residual urine varied from 50 to 300 ml and bacteriuria was found. Occasional expulsions of several ml of urine were caused by peristalsis within this short tubular segment. In the following 18 patients, the low pressure reservoir was anastomosed directly to the membranous urethra. Micturition was good, with no notable residual urine, no bacteriuria and no paroxysmal urinary incontinence. However, a safety pad is used by half of the patients because once or twice a week, mainly at night, a few ml of urine may be lost. No significant changes in serum electrolytes, bicarbonate or creatinine were noted. With the three different antireflux techniques used, no obstructive or inflammatory changes in the upper urinary tracts were found, although no long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was given.\r"

The urine container was made of large and small intestine and bladder in several combinations.

To determine whether this self-perpetuating disease is the result of an autoimmune disorder, we studied 26 patients with IC of mean duration 5 years and compared the results with those of a control group of similar age and sex with other urological complaints. We performed a standard autoimmune profile and looked for specific antibodies to normal human bladder in the serum, using an indirect immunofluorescence technique. Deep bladder biopsies were examined by conventional histology and cryostat sections were studied with peroxidase-conjugated anti-human antibodies in a search for immunoglobulin deposition within the bladder. Seventeen of 26 patients with IC (65%) and 5 of 14 controls (36%) demonstrated non-organ-specific antibodies; 40% of those with IC had anti-nuclear antibodies; 18 IC patients (75%) and 4 of 10 controls (40%) had anti-bladder antibodies present in the serum, but 5 healthy volunteers showed no such antibody activity. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for either type of antibody (Fisher's exact test). Only 5 of 17 patients with IC (29%) showed immunoglobulin deposition in the bladder epithelium, a similar proportion to controls (38%); 4 of these 5 had circulating anti-bladder antibodies present in the serum. Although IC patients demonstrated a non-specific increase in antibody formation, this was not significantly different from a similar group of other urological patients. The lack of specificity makes this immunological response more likely to be a secondary phenomenon associated with inflammatory damage to the bladder rather than the primary cause of the disease.\r"

The most frequently encountered nitrosamines were N-nitrosodi-n-butylamine and N-nitrosodiethylamine. Total N-nitrosamine levels in excess of 100 ng/g were found in 6 of the 16 catheters tested. When compared with the cytotoxicity of the catheters a significant correlation was found, with increasing nitrosamine content being associated with greater cytotoxicity. In view of the reported toxic and carcinogenic effects of these compounds it is suggested that the nitrosamine content of catheters be routinely monitored and safe regulatory limits be imposed.\r"

One of the reasons for this decline in popularity is the risk of cardiovascular side effects during treatment with oestrogens. In the literature, different dosages of DES and ethinyloestradiol are recommended and different rates of cardiovascular side effects are reported. In a prospective study, 18 patients were treated with ethinyloestradiol 0.05 mg/day. In most cases this lowered the plasma testosterone permanently below castrate level during therapy. Also, because the acid phosphatase returned to normal in almost all patients, this treatment seemed adequate. In 4 patients the treatment was stopped because of side effects, in 3 of these because of cardiovascular complications. The cardiovascular side effect at this dose are considerable (29%) but comparable rates are reported in some studies following placebo treatment of patients with prostatic carcinoma.\r"

Five different techniques were used: bladder flap neourethroplasty, neourethroplasty using a urinary tract remnant, vaginal/urogenital sinus neourethroplasty, pedicled labial skin tube neourethroplasty and colonic substitution neourethroplasty with synchronous implantation of an artificial sphincter. Bladder flap neourethroplasty is appropriate if the bladder size is adequate and if the bladder neck is incompetent, but stress incontinence is a common complication which must be anticipated and dealt with proleptically. Vaginal/UG sinus neourethroplasty is preferred if the bladder neck is competent enough to preserve continence. When no other tissue is available, particularly after radiotherapy, a pedicled labial skin tube neourethroplasty gives the best results. Colonic substitution with the implantation of an artificial sphincter is not satisfactory. Any surgically created neourethra should be wrapped with either labial fat pads or omentum and, in the absence of a competent bladder neck, with an artificial sphincter cuff to support the urethra and to prevent it telescoping, and for use as a back-up if continence is not adequate.\r"

As the medical profession struggles to develop guidelines and policies to help it deal with this disease, it can draw on very little systematic research on the effect of AIDS on physicians' attitudes and practices. We suggest a framework developed from the literature on physicians' and society's response to other disorders that would provide a basis for organizing the ever-increasing amount of information on physicians and AIDS and would guide systematic research aimed at understanding and predicting physicians' participation in the prevention and management of AIDS. Within this framework we consider how characteristics of the disease, elements of the health care system and physicians' attitudes interact to influence clinical and personal practices. AIDS had led to new delineations of physicians' responsibility, modification of prevailing beliefs about physician autonomy and thus a redefinition of the role of the physician in North America.\r"

All the women in the two groups were categorized retrospectively as being at low risk at the onset of labour on the basis of their prenatal records and their admission histories and physical examination results. There were higher proportions of younger women and women of lower socioeconomic status in the family physician group than in the obstetrician group (p less than 0.001). The rates of interventions, including artificial rupture of the membranes, induction, augmentation, low forceps plus vacuum extraction, episiotomy and epidural anesthesia, were all higher in the obstetrician group. The mean birth weight and the cesarean section rate were the same in the two groups. Differences in labour and delivery outcomes between the two groups, including a higher rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery for the family physicians, reflected a more \"expectant\" practice style by family doctors. However, there were no significant differences in the rates of maternal or neonatal complications. A practice style characterized by a higher rate of interventions was not associated with improved maternal or newborn outcome in this low-risk setting.\r"

The patients were classified as being at low risk on admission by means of chart review. Family physicians and specialists were found to have similar rates for most of the interventions measured, although the interventions for which significantly different rates were found suggest a less interventionist style of intrapartum care by family physicians. There were no significant differences in maternal or neonatal outcomes except for a higher proportion of infants weighing less than 2500 g among primigravid women cared for by family physicians compared with those under the care of specialists. Self-selection of physician specialty by patients resulted in differences in the demographic characteristics of the two patient populations. The findings support the continued involvement of family physicians in the provision of obstetric care.\r"

Although tubal ligation predominated in almost every province and year its rate declined by 27.6% over the study period, whereas the rate of vasectomy increased by 39.1%. When projected to 1988 the national rates for the two procedures became nearly equal; those for Quebec had become equal by 1986. Provincial differences were most marked in eastern Canada, where neighbouring provinces had the highest and the lowest rates of sterilization in the country. Given the relative economic and surgical disadvantages of tubal ligation, policymakers may wish to consider fostering an increased acceptance of vasectomy, particularly in areas where such acceptance continues to be slow.\r"

The liquid preparations that were popular earlier in this century reflected fascination with bottled medicinals, consistent with the growing era of pharmaceutical medicine. Today's questionable remedies are similarly consistent with their social and cultural context. \"Metabolic\" therapies emphasizing diet, self care, vitamins, and internal cleansing, along with \"immune-enhancing\" regimens, represent today's reigning \"alternatives.\" Such approaches reflect underlying social trends and values, such as belief in assuming personal responsibility for one's health, the importance of self care and physical fitness, patients' rights movements, dietary emphases encouraged by conventional and alternative medicine alike, the holistic medicine movement, and general disaffection with organized medicine. Just as questionable therapies are born of the values and beliefs of their culture, so these treatments and their use affect the social environment in which they exist. The relationship is reciprocal and cyclic, with social trends encouraging particular forms of questionable regimens and these regimens, in turn, reinforcing prevailing social beliefs. Public beliefs about cancer were reflected in responses to our studies of unorthodox cancer therapies and of psychosocial correlates of survival. Responses revealed widely held values and beliefs about cancer, cancer treatment, and medicine generally. These themes are described.\r"

According to Galian et al. six patients were classified Stage A, two Stage B, and 13 Stage C. The therapeutic regimen included the following: (1) Antibiotics: In the case of intestinal bacterial overgrowth (IBO), antibiotics selected by their antibiograms were delivered; in absence of IBO, metronidazole plus ampicillin were first given. The antibiotic treatment was changed in case of therapeutic failure. (2) Chemotherapy: From 1981 to 1983 a cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), teniposide (VM-26), prednisone (CHVP) protocol (Adriamycin 35 mg/m2, teniposide 50 mg/m2 day 2, cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 days 2 through 4, prednisone 40 mg/m2 days 1 through 10) was used. After 1983 bleomycin 15 mg, Adriamycin 30 mg, vinblastine 10 mg were given on day 15. Serum immunoelectrophoresis and immunohistochemical study of duodenojejunal specimens were made on a 3-month and 6-month basis, respectively. Survival curve analysis was made according to Kaplan and Meier. Results were as follows: (1) Stage A: Six patients were first treated by antibiotics alone; two complete responses (CR) persisting 42 and 55 months later were observed, respectively. The four antibiotic failures were submitted to further chemotherapy with four subsequent failures and two deaths. (2) Stage B-C: Chemotherapy led to nine CR with one precocious relapse, a salvage chemotherapy allowing to one more CR. (3) All stages mixed, percentage of survival reached 90 +/- 12% at 2 years and 67 +/- 25% at 3 years, all patients alive beyond 3.5 years being disease-free.\r"

In an attempt to predict the hormone responsiveness of breast cancer in vivo, we have assayed total 52K cathepsin D and its precursor in the primary breast cancer cytosol of 36 patients treated before surgery with 30 mg of tamoxifen daily for 1 to 5 weeks (average, 3 weeks). Compared to a similar control population, total 52K cathepsin D was increased by tamoxifen (P = 0.02) but less so than its precursor (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, 45% of the RE-positive tumors from tamoxifen-treated patients had a higher cathepsin D precursor concentration than the same type of tumor from control patients, or than RE-negative tumors from tamoxifen-treated patients. This 3-week challenge test was probably too short to avoid partial estrogenic activity of tamoxifen (flare) and the authors infer that longer time of treatment would decrease rather than increase the concentration of cathepsin D in the RE-responsive tumors. However, two cancers from patients with relapses after prolonged tamoxifen treatment (greater than 6 months) also had high concentrations of 52K cathepsin D and its precursor. The authors conclude that the concentration of cathepsin D and its precursor in breast cancer cytosol can be increased by short-term tamoxifen treatment, suggesting that these tumors are estrogen responsive.\r"

Sixty-eight patients were evaluable for response or survival. Patients with disease confined to the chest had a 53% complete response rate with an overall response rate of 73%. Patients with localized pelvic recurrences or persistence demonstrated no complete responses and a 21% overall response rate. Isolated chest metastases are more likely to respond to cisplatin than pelvic recurrences (P = 0.0007); however, location of recurrence did not significantly alter survival (mean 22.7 months versus 14.1 months; P = 0.24.). Concomitant disease in other locations reduced the likelihood of response in the chest (P less than 0.05) by virtue of lack of response in those other sites. Lesion size, clinical stage, patient age, and duration from primary treatment to recurrence were not of significance with regard to response or survival. When evaluating response to chemotherapy in recurrent cervical cancer, location of metastasis and effect on survival must be considered.\r"

Associated with this treatment, there was a high incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). In an effort to reduce this toxicity, this regimen minus TAM was studied, and the results are reported. Twenty of twenty patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. There was one complete response (CR) lasting 5+ months and one partial response (PR) lasting 4+ months for an overall response rate of 10% (95% confidence limits, 1.23% to 31.70%). Two patients exhibited a mixed response and three patients developed disease stabilization lasting 4 to 10 months. Toxicity was similar to the original study except that no patients developed DVT or PE. This statistically significant (Fisher's exact test [two-tail] P = 0.008) decrease in the response rate by comparison with that achieved with the TAM-containing regimen may signal an essential role of TAM in this regimen. TAM may be acting in synergy with cisplatin through its calcium channel-blocking properties. TAM should be included as described in the initial reports, and the patients should be carefully observed for vascular complications.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have documented an increase of thrombotic complications in patients with carcinoma of the breast receiving chemotherapy regimens containing cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil. The authors studied blood from nine such patients screening for abnormalities that might predispose to thrombosis or indicate that the coagulation cascade had been activated. Six of the patients were in the adjuvant setting, and three had metastatic disease. Samples were collected from each patient before, during, and after completion of the chemotherapy in question. In each patient a statistically significant decline in functional protein C activity (P = 0.001) was demonstrated at midtherapy. In seven of nine patients functional protein C level normalized after the cessation of therapy. No other positive results were found. The authors conclude that the combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil, when administered to patients with a diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast, causes a reversible decline in the activity of protein C.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the Radiation Oncology Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, St. Louis, Missouri. Of 210 patients treated from April 1954 through December 1982, 70 were treated with radiotherapy alone (RT), 121 received immediate postoperative RT (2 to 6 weeks), and 19 received RT following surgical failure. The mean follow-up time from the date of diagnosis for those patients alive at the time of last follow-up was 13.0 years (range, 3.0 to 30.0 years). Actuarial progression-free survival was analyzed up to 30 years. The 10-, 20-, and 30-year progression-free survival was 80.5%, 73.5%, and 73.5% for those patients treated with irradiation alone and 92.8%, 71.2%, and 44.0% for those treated with immediate postoperative irradiation. The median time to first failure from initial diagnosis by original treatment was 3.8 years for surgery alone, 4.2 years for RT only, and 10.2 years for surgery plus postoperative RT. Analysis for risk of recurrence per 5-year interval was performed using a hazard function analysis. The risk of recurrence after radiotherapy alone was greatest during the first 5-year interval after treatment and decreased to zero by 20 years. However, the risk of recurrence after primary surgery and postoperative radiotherapy revealed an increasing risk for recurrence up to 30 years after treatment. The concept of \"cure\" for pituitary adenomas requires extended follow-up.\r"

The specificity of SCC antigen and the factors influencing its release into serum were evaluated. Antigen concentrations were measured in 157 tissue extracts and in 188 sera of patients with nonmalignant or malignant gynecologic diseases. A commercial radioimmunoassay based on polyclonal antibodies (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago) was used. Cytosol concentrations were significantly higher (P less than 0.005) in normal squamous epithelia (means = 6040 ng/mg cell protein [CP]) and in squamous cell carcinomas (means = 2483 ng/mg CP) of the exocervix than those in normal columnar epithelia and in adenocarcinomas of the endocervix, endometrium, ovary, and breast (means = 1-508 ng/mg CP). Despite the high antigen concentrations in normal squamous epithelia, elevated serum levels (greater than 2.5 ng/ml) were almost exclusively found in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinomas. The sensitivity of SCC antigen as a marker for primary carcinomas was 61%, increasing from 29% in Stage I to 89% in Stage IV. The positivity rate was higher in women with well-differentiated (78%) and moderately differentiated carcinomas (67%) than in those with poorly differentiated tumors (38%). The results show that SCC antigen is not tumor specific. The release into serum is independent of local tissue content, but is apparently influenced by the infiltrative growth, the mass, and the degree of histologic differentiation of the tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Grossly visible peritoneal carcinomatosis resembling that seen in man was produced in athymic mice 7 days after intraperitoneal injection of 8 x 10(5) cells of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-producing human colon carcinoma cell line LS174T. The mice received intraperitoneal injections of 40 to 160 microCi of yttrium-90 (90Y)-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (MAb). When the mice were killed 12 days after injection, a significant inhibition of tumor growth, ranging from 40% to 95%, was observed in the treated animals when compared to the growth of tumors in the untreated animals (P less than 0.001). No mortality secondary to the therapy was seen. The bone marrow was depleted significantly at the higher doses of labeled MAb, but total recovery was observed 4 weeks after treatment. Histologically, the treated tumors showed extensive radiation effects early in the posttherapy period and massive necrosis at later times. Minute foci of viable tumor remained in the periphery. New tumor outgrowths with histologic features similar to those in the untreated controls began to appear 3 weeks after therapy. The CEA expression of the treated tumors was similar to that of the untreated controls during the early posttreatment period, diminishing progressively as the tumors became necrotic. Newly grown tumor nodules in the treated animals lacked significant CEA expression both initially and at later times. Our studies suggest that therapy with 90Y-anti-CEA MAb therapy results in selection of tumor clones lacking CEA, and that a single large dose of 90Y-MAb should be more effective than multiple fractions of smaller doses.\r"

  ".W": "A rat model was established for evaluating the biology of locally recurring mammary tumors after surgical resection of the primary tumor. Eight distinct cell lines were independently derived from primary tumors and local recurrences after surgical removal of 13762NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma clone MTF7(T20). In vivo tumor doubling times between the \"parental\" MTF7(T20) cell line, primary tumor-derived cell lines sc1 and sc3, and the local recurrence (LR) sublines varied after the inoculation of 10(6) tumor cells into the mammary fat pad of female Fischer 344 rats. Doubling times were shorter for LR3, and LR4, LR5, and LR6 than their primaries sc3 and MTF7(T20), respectively, and longer for LR1 and LR1a than their primary tumor sc1. The LR sublines varied considerably for their experimental metastatic potentials. Both increases and decreases in metastatic potential were seen compared to MTF7(T20), sc1, and sc3. Karyotype analysis by G-banding revealed the presence in the LR sublines of several marker chromosomes, previously identified in MTF7 at tissue cultures 11 and 35. Two new chromosome markers were identified: M54, shared by MTF7(T20), sc1, LR4, LR5 and LR6, and M55, shared by MTF7(T20), sc1, LR1, sc3, LR3, LR4, and LR6. These data indicate that local tumor regrowth after surgical excision of the primary tumor in this model most likely selects the growth of tumor cell subpopulations already present within the primary tumor. Differences in growth kinetics, karyotype, and metastatic potential between the parental MTF7(T20), primary tumors sc1 and sc3, and their LR sublines may reflect in vivo influences on the phenotypic diversity generated during the development of local mammary tumor recurrences after surgical treatment of the primary tumor.\r"

All were female patients, 14 to 80 years (median, 25). Bilateral lesions were synchronous in three and asynchronous in one case. One tumor grew near a saline breast implant, one followed trauma, and one arose at the site of excision of a fibroadenoma a year earlier. No patient had Gardner's syndrome. Two patients had contralateral carcinoma and one was previously treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two lesions were subareolar. Size ranged from 1 to 10 cm (average, 3 cm). Microscopically, some of the fibrocollagenous proliferations were keloidal. Others were more cellular with rare mitoses (less than 1/10 high-power field). Focal lymphoid infiltrates in about 50% of cases were mainly peripheral. Twenty were treated first by excision and two had mastectomy with residual tumor found in one breast. Six patients (27%) had recurrences after 2 to 72 months (average, 30 mo) including one bilateral recurrence. Recurrences in four cases were treated by reexcision, one had no treatment, and one mastectomy was performed for a 4-cm recurrence. Although histologically benign, mammary fibromatosis recurs locally and rarely when recurrent requires radical surgery. It should not be mistaken for an inflammatory condition. Wide local excision is recommended for initial therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Two cases of metastatic gestational choriocarcinoma to the lungs have been encountered that presented unusual histologic patterns. Both lesions were solitary metastases that followed multiple courses of chemotherapy, and the patients had low serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. Surgical excision appeared to be curative in both cases. Both neoplasms were characterized by a predominance of uniform but highly atypical mononucleate trophoblastic cells. These cells infiltrated pulmonary parenchyma, forming nests of tumor with central dense necrotic debris. Syncytiotrophoblastic cells (STB) were present but showed scant cytoplasm and little vacuolization. Hemorrhage was only focal. Immunohistochemistry revealed that some of the multinucleate STB and occasional mononucleate cells produced hCG, while human placental lactogen was focally produced in the tumors. By electron microscopy the STB were identified but lacked open lacunae lined by microvilli. Most mononucleate cells showed greater maturation evidenced by a more complex cytoplasm than is seen in typical cytotrophoblastic cells (CTB). The results suggest that these tumors are a distinctive subtype of choriocarcinoma composed largely of a form of trophoblastic cell with features intermediate between CTB and STB, yet different from the intermediate trophoblast of the placental site tumor. Identification of this morphologic variant of choriocarcinoma may have clinical utility as additional cases are studied.\r"

Estrogen receptor content was not significantly associated with prognosis in our material, but patients with progesterone receptor positive lesions had a better survival than those in which the tumors were progesterone receptor negative. Multivariate analysis also clarified that only three features in combination had independent significance: mean shortest nuclear axis, DNA index, and depth of myometrial invasion (in sequence of decreasing importance). The prognostic rule consisting of these features overshadowed the value of all other features investigated. The overriding prognostic value of this highly reproducible rule was clear from the complete separation of 27 survivors and six nonsurvivors in the learning set of 33 patients. In an independent test set, all three nonsurvivors and 13 of the 14 survivors were correctly classified, thus confirming the accuracy and reliability of the developed rule to predict the outcome of future patients with Stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma.\r"

The mean plasma zinc concentration of healthy men was 14.9 mumol/l +/- 0.5 SEM, whereas those with BPH and malignant glands were 16.5 mumol/l +/- 0.6 SEM and 11 mumol/l +/- 0.7 SEM, respectively. The mean serum cadmium concentrations were 15.2 mumol/l +/- 0.6 SEM, 15.5 mumol/l +/- 0.7 SEM, and 24.2 +/- 0.9 SEM for normal, BPH, and cancer subjects, respectively. The mean prostatic tissue zinc concentration in normal gland was 12.1 mumol/g +/- 0.8 SEM, BPH 17.9 mumol/g +/- 0.6 SEM, and cancer gland 2.9 mumol/g +/- 0.4 SEM. The mean prostatic tissue cadmium concentration for normal BPH and malignant glands were 3.8 mumol/g +/- 0.6 SEM, 14.6 mumol/g +/- 0.37 SEM. The serum and prostatic tissue values of these trace metals in our controls, BPH, and cancer subjects compare with those from populations with higher prostatic cancer rates. This suggests that these metals do not primarily play any significant role in the reported low incidence rate of prostatic cancer in our community. Furthermore, in control subjects and those with BPH, cadmium/zinc ratio, whether evaluated for serum or prostatic tissue was one or less. In patients with cancer, however, this ratio was always greater than one. The possible clinical use of this ratio to diagnose cancer of the prostate gland and to follow-up such patients needs to be further evaluated through more studies.\r"

One synchronous cancer per 100 patients, in the contralateral breast, was detected by mammography only. Eleven percent of the patients, who had a previous cancer of the breast and were followed for a maximum 11 years, developed cancer of the contralateral breast; 50% of the metachronous cancers were found by mammography only. In 1000 symptomatic patients without an indication for biopsy on physical examination, five cancers were found on mammography.

Satisfactory data were obtained in follow-ups of all 1331 patients examined. There were only 31 (3.7%) false-negative diagnoses of malignancy among 858 patients diagnosed as having benign lesions, and only three (0.6%) false-positive diagnoses among 473 patients diagnosed as having malignant tumors. The false-negative diagnoses were most frequent in cases of elevated types of early cancer, advanced cancer of type 4 and leiomyosarcoma, or in cases located in the posterior wall and in the antrum. The three benign lesions that were diagnosed as malignant by biopsy were all associated with active ulceration, indicating that care is necessary in taking biopsy specimens of ulcerated lesions. From these findings the sensitivity and specificity of the gastrofiberscopic biopsy method for detection of gastric malignancies were calculated to be 93.8% and 99.6%, respectively, and the overall accuracy for all the patients was 97.4%. These results reconfirm that gastrofiberscopic biopsy is very useful for diagnosis of gastric malignancies.\r"

To determine which clinical and pathologic features can predict the presence of positive lymph nodes (LN+), a retrospective review of 168 patients who underwent potentially curative surgery for rectosigmoid and rectal cancer was performed. By univariate analysis, tumor penetration, grade, and histology were significant predictive features. This was confirmed by logistic regression analysis. The incidence of LN+ increased with increasing tumor penetration (T1, 0%; T2, 28%; T3, 36%; T4, 53%; P = 0.04), grade of adenocarcinoma (well-differentiated, 0%; moderately differentiated, 30%; poorly differentiated, 50%; P = 0.07, [borderline significance]), and the presence of any colloid histology (pure adenocarcinoma, 30%; total colloid, 52%; P = 0.04). Using 2 X 2 contingency tables, the presence of blood vessel invasion (BVI), lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI), vascular invasion (VI), total colloid histology, and high grade further increased the incidence of LN+ with increasing tumor penetration. Regardless of tumor size, grade, histology, BVI, LVI, or VI, none of the nine patients with Stage T1 tumors or the seven with well-differentiated adenocarcinomas had LN+. For this group, local excision alone is recommended. The incidence of LN+ was greater than or equal to 19% in all other categories. For this group of patients, if there is no evidence of gross tumor in the pelvis, then a local excision plus adjuvant pelvic radiation may be an alternative to radical surgery.\r"

Left coronary angiography was performed in 12 \"normal\" closed-chest dogs with 10-cc injections of H76, HB, and OM in a randomized, blinded fashion. The maximal change in the left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure (SP), mean aortic pressure (MAP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and LV dp/dt were recorded. The LVSP and MAP fell 30 +/- 3 mm Hg and 26 +/- 4 mm Hg with H76, 22 +/- 2 mm Hg and 19 +/- 2 mm Hg with HB, and 7 +/- 1.5 mm Hg and 5 +/- 1 mm Hg with OM (P less than .001). The LVEDP increased 4.8 +/- 0.5 mm Hg with H76, 3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg with HB, but only 0.2 mm Hg with OM (P less than .001). The LV dp/dt decreased 392 +/- 63 mm Hg/sec with H76 and 235 +/- 21 mm Hg/sec with HB, but increased 411 +/- 50 mm Hg with OM (P less than .001). In eight additional open-chest dogs, left coronary angiography was performed 1 hr after occlusion of the proximal LAD coronary artery and in the presence of a critical circumflex coronary artery (CX) stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the pathophysiologic relevance of angiographically irregular coronary stenoses in postinfarction angina (PIA), we analyzed the clinical course and coronary angiograms of 73 patients studied within 30 days of infarction. Coronary lesions were classified as smooth or irregular. Thirty-six patients had PIA (Group 1) and 37 had an uncomplicated course (Group 2). Irregular lesion(s) in patent infarct-related arteries were found in 77% of Group 1 vs. 24% of Group 2 patients (P less than 0.005). Irregular lesion(s) in any coronary artery were found in 58% of Group 1 versus 19% of Group 2 patients (P less than 0.002). Other univariate predictors of PIA included older age, hypertension, angina before myocardial infarct, lower peak creatine kinase, three-vessel disease, and higher modified Gensini score. Multivariate analysis ranked lesion irregularity as the strongest predictor of PIA. Our data suggests that ruptured atherosclerotic plaques may be important in the pathogenesis of PIA. It is possible that lesion irregularity is associated with an active process and/or a residual thrombus, which may be responsible for postinfarction angina.\r"

This previously unreported pattern suggests partial persistence of the peritruncal ring, which occurs during normal embryologic development of the coronary circulation.

Also, because AIDS-related complex (ARC) is, in general, a milder form of AIDS, we wondered if echocardiographic abnormalities would differ in kind or in frequency, when compared with AIDS. To answer these questions, we studied the echocardiographic findings and the demographic features of 15 patients with AIDS and 24 patients with ARC. The ARC group had abnormalities in the same proportion as in our AIDS group, except for echocardiographic mitral valve prolapse. The MVP, however, did not appear to be due to intrinsic valvular disease. Rather, echocardiographic MVP was associated with low body weight (P = .02) but not with the cardiac signs or symptoms of MVP. Four AIDS patients had LV dysfunction. Of the echocardiographic variables, only a wide EPSS was significantly correlated with survival, as it is in other populations. We conclude that although echocardiographic abnormalities are common in AIDS and ARC patients, most of these abnormalities lack clinical significance.\r"

Five coronary dissections occurred, four of the right coronary artery and one of the left internal mammary artery, which had been grafted to the left anterior descending artery. One patient had angina following an air embolus; there were no significant intramyocardial injections of contrast agent. The pressure generated in the catheter by hand injection of contrast agent was compared with that generated by the injector pump. Contrast agent was injected through a 7F Judkins Right 4 and an 8F Sones catheter by hand at slow, medium, and fast rates by hand and by the injector pump at 2,3, and 4 ml/sec; maximum pressure generated was recorded. Although the pressures generated through a Sones catheter were similar using both methods, pressures with hand injection were much more variable. The pressures generated with hand injection through a Judkins catheter were lower than those with pump injection, but again the pressures showed much greater variability with hand injection. The pump was found to be safe, reliable, predictable, and convenient when used for coronary angiography with Sones and Judkins catheters. It eliminates the need for a trained assistant during the procedure of coronary angiography.\r"

This technique was compared with the \"true\" gradient obtained by measurement of the simultaneous LV and central aortic pressures, and is accurate (R = 0.999) and relatively simple. Other approaches used to determine the mean transaortic valve gradient were less accurate: simultaneous LV-FA (R = 0.991); aligned LV-FA (R = 0.974); averaged simultaneous and aligned LV-FA (R = 0.981); and nonsimultaneous LV-aorta pullback (R = 0.953).

The thrombotic propensity of contrast agents can be evaluated by measuring the clot formation of the mixtures. The experiments were repeated with whole blood after systemic heparinization. In the in vitro study, 5 ml of canine (N = 10) and 3 ml of human (N = 11) whole blood was incubated for 30 min in glass tubes with equal volumes of IOH, H76, HB, and 0.9% NaCl before heparinization.

Following heparinization, no clot was visualized in any mixture of whole blood with contrast media or 0.9% NaCl. Similar results were observed in the catheter-syringe system with canine blood (N = 11) mixed with the contrast agents.

The microstructure of tympanosclerosis is an irregular three-dimensional collagen lattice, enclosing distinct, spherical, mineralized aggregates, housed in lacunar-like spaces. This lattice is continuous with the plaque surface which is an envelope, probably of proteinaceous material. The spherical calcified aggregates were absent from the demineralized specimens.

No peak-peak conversion was significantly greater following adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy compared with no pharyngeal surgery in those with small airways and tonsillectomy conferred no additional benefit. Adenoidectomy with or without tonsillectomy is probably best avoided in children with large radiographic palatal airway measurements when planning surgical treatment for established disease, although this may ultimately be related to age at operation.\r"
