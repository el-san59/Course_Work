Steroid induced myopathy shares some nonspecific features with psoriatic myopathy, but can be differentiated by the clinical response to cessation of steroid therapy. Myalgia and 24 h urine creatine elevation are 2 features not previously described in association with psoriatic myopathy.

  ".W": "The chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, reported to be a complete carcinogen in rodents and a tumor initiator for mouse skin, was tested for activity to enhance the conversion of carcinogen-induced skin papillomas to carcinomas. Initiation of mouse skin by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene followed by 12 weeks of promotion by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate produced seven to eight papillomas/mouse. Ten weekly injections of 100 micrograms of cisplatin into these papilloma-bearing mice induced a 2.3-fold enhancement of conversion relative to the spontaneous rate of 1.9%. Even a single exposure to cisplatin in tumor-bearing mice increased the carcinoma incidence to the same extent as 10 exposures to urethane, an agent previously shown to enhance malignant conversion. At the dose tested, cisplatin was inactive as a complete carcinogen or a tumor promoter. Cisplatin-DNA adducts, measured in samples from skin, liver, and kidneys, were persistent for at least 4 weeks after the last exposure to cisplatin. Thus cisplatin is a relatively potent inducer of the putative genotoxic changes required for conversion of skin tumors from a benign to a malignant phenotype. The activity of cisplatin in the initiation and malignant conversion stages in this animal model for carcinogenesis suggests that patients given cisplatin-based chemotherapy are at increased risk for the development of treatment-induced second cancers.\r"

Hamsters treated with DMBA and nicotine showed significantly (P less than .001) more tumors and a significantly (P less than .05) greater-than-expected proportion of large tumors (greater than or equal to 3-mm diameter) than hamsters treated with DMBA alone. Histologically, there was a greater degree of dysplasia in lesions from the group receiving DMBA plus nicotine than in the DMBA only group. The results suggest that nicotine acts as a cofactor in DMBA tumorigenesis.\r"

Plasma cholesterol concentrations were 4.7% lower than those in serum samples. The plasma and serum values were highly correlated (r = .994), however, suggesting that measurements in EDTA plasma can be converted readily to equivalent serum concentrations. Thus, the negative bias in EDTA plasma was greater than the 3% value cited in the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines, probably because the amount of EDTA now provided in evacuated blood collection tubes is 50% greater than in those used when the 3% value was established. These findings are relevant to the interpretation of both cholesterol screening measurements and follow-up lipoprotein analyses.\r"

Of the 59 patients, 15 (25%) were not approved for the transplantation program for medical reasons; in addition, 16 patients declined participation and 3 were not accepted because of lack of financial resources. Medical reasons for exclusion from pancreas transplantation were coronary artery disease in six patients, severe peripheral vascular disease in six patients, other medical problems in two patients, and noncompliance in one patient. Thus, many patients who underwent assessment for pancreas transplantation did not enter the program because of medical, financial, or personal preference reasons. In most cases, the medical reason for exclusion from pancreas transplantation was a cardiovascular disorder.\r"

They bind antigen with high affinity via their immunoglobulin receptors, process it through the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) pathway, and present its fragments to class II-restricted T lymphocytes. In general, exogenous antigens and noninfectious viral particles enter the class II pathway and are selectively associated with class II MHC molecules. The presentation of an exogenous antigen in association with class I molecules has been reported for only a few antigens, including the hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBenvAg). Here we demonstrate that antigen-specific B cells can efficiently deliver HBenvAg to the class I pathway, presenting its fragments to class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) which kill the specific B cells. This could represent a mechanism of suppression of neutralizing anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody response, a phenomenon that accompanies the development of the chronic HBV-carrier state.\r"

To study transformation-relevant tyrosine kinase substrates, we have generated monoclonal antibodies to individual tyrosine phosphoproteins, including p130, p120, p110, and five additional phosphoproteins (p210, p125, p118, p85, and p185/p64). These antibodies detected several of the same tyrosine phosphoproteins in chicken embryo fibroblasts transformed by avian retroviruses Y73 and CT10, encoding the yes and crk oncogenes, respectively. Protein substrates in mouse, rat, hamster, and human cells overexpressing activated variants of chicken pp60src were also detected by several of the monoclonal antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis involves mononuclear phagocytic cells as hosts to intracellular parasites, accessory cells in the induction of the immune response, effector cells for mycobacterial killing, and targets of cytotoxic lymphocytes. When stimulated by whole mycobacteria or various mycobacterial preparations, monocytes and macrophages produce the cytokines interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor, which possess multiple functions, including immune induction, and may be responsible for the fever and cachexia prominent in tuberculosis. To identify mycobacterial proteins that may directly activate production of these cytokines, culture filtrate of M. tuberculosis that had been subjected to gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose paper was used to stimulate monocyte production of cytokines. Fractions representing molecular weights of 46,000 and 20,000 consistently induced both interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. The magnitude of the monocyte responses to these fractions was similar to that to intact mycobacteria or optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide. This stimulatory effect was not due to contamination with either bacterial lipopolysaccharide or mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan, as it was abolished by digestion with Streptomyces griseus protease but was unaffected by ammonium sulfate precipitation, preincubation with polymyxin B, or depletion of lipoarabinomannan by immunoaffinity chromatography. Proteins identified by this system may have considerable potential as immunogens, as the capacity to directly stimulate mononuclear phagocyte production of cytokines is an essential property of adjuvants.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the function of a mutant insulin receptor (IR) molecule in which Tyr-1146, one of the first autophosphorylation sites in the beta subunit, was replaced with phenylalanine (IRF1146). Autophosphorylation of the partially purified IRF1146 was reduced 60-70% when compared to the wild-type IR but was still stimulated by insulin. The phosphotransferase activity of the dephospho form of both the IR and IRF1146 toward exogenous substrates was stimulated 3- to 4-fold by insulin. However, the wild-type IR was activated 12-fold by autophosphorylation, whereas the IRF1146 was activated only 2-fold. When the IRF1146 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, insulin binding was normal, whereas autophosphorylation was reduced 80% when compared to cells expressing the wild-type IR. Endogenous substrates of the insulin receptor kinase were not detected during insulin stimulation of CHO cells expressing the IRF1146. Moreover, the IRF1146 did not internalize insulin rapidly or stimulate DNA synthesis in the presence of insulin. In contrast, both the IR and IRF1146 stimulated glycogen synthase equally in CHO cells. These data suggest that activation of the IR tyrosine kinase can be resolved into two components: the first is dependent on insulin binding and the second is dependent on the subsequent insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation cascade. Thus, at least two signal transduction pathways diverging from the IR are implicated in the mechanism of insulin action.\r"

Giant two-dimensional electrophoresis, which can resolve greater than 3000 polypeptides from [35S]methionine-labeled cell lysates, was used to detect the induction of a p72-74 (72-74 kDa) doublet (pI 7.5) after activation of p60v-src at 35 degrees C. Antiserum against cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin synthase or prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase) specifically immunoprecipitated the p72-74 doublet. The p72-74 doublet was also induced by platelet-derived growth factor and by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and was elevated in an NIH 3T3 cell line transformed by wild-type src. Activation of p60v-src caused a persistent increase in p72-74, whereas the effect of the growth factor was transient. These dissimilar kinetics of induction were paralleled by changes in cyclooxygenase activity. Down-regulation of protein kinase C inhibited subsequent induction of cyclooxygenase by phorbol myristate acetate but did not block induction by p60v-src. The glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone inhibited induction of cyclooxygenase by p60v-src. Although induction of this enzyme may not be directly involved in transformation, the data support the view that oncogenic transformation may result, not from expression of transformation-specific genes, but from persistent changes in the expression of genes normally induced only transiently during passage from the G0 stage of the cell cycle.\r"

  ".W": "The heparin-sensitive binding of 125I-labeled low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to homogenates from 18 different normal human tissues and some solid tumors was determined. The binding to adrenal and liver homogenates fulfilled criteria established for the binding of LDL to its receptor--namely, (i) saturability, (ii) sensitivity to proteolytic destruction, (iii) inhibition by EDTA, and (iv) heat sensitivity. When the binding of 125I-labeled LDL was assayed at a constant concentration (50 micrograms/ml), the adrenal gland and the ovary had the highest binding of normal tissues. The highest binding per g of tissue overall was obtained in homogenates of a gastric carcinoma and a parotid adenoma. When the weights of the parenchymatous organs were considered, the major amount of LDL receptors was contained in the liver. To study the possible regulation of hepatic LDL-receptor expression, 11 patients were pretreated with cholestyramine (8 g twice a day for 3 weeks). Increased binding activity (+105%, P less than 0.001) was obtained in homogenates from liver biopsies from the cholestyramine-treated patients as compared with 12 untreated controls. It is concluded that the liver is the most important organ for LDL catabolism in humans and that the receptor activity in this organ can be regulated upon pharmacologic intervention. Further studies are needed to confirm the possibility that certain solid tumors can exhibit high numbers of LDL receptors.\r"

The pre- and post-heparin plasma LPL mass in the proband was elevated when compared to controls; however, there was no detectable LPL activity, indicating the presence of a defective enzyme (termed LPLBethesda). Analysis of the patient's post-heparin plasma by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography demonstrated that the mutant LPL had an altered affinity for heparin. Southern blot hybridization of the gene for LPLBethesda revealed no major rearrangements. Northern blot analysis of LPLBethesda mRNA from patient monocyte-derived macrophages revealed normal-sized mRNAs (3.4 and 3.7 kilobases) as well as normal cellular mRNA levels when compared to control macrophages. Sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified LPL cDNA revealed a G----A substitution at position 781 of the normal LPL gene that resulted in the substitution of an alanine for a threonine at residue 176 and the loss of an SfaNI site present in the normal LPL gene. Amplification of cDNA by the PCR followed by digestion with SfaNI established that the patient was a true homozygote for the mutation. Expression of LPL cDNA in COS-7 cells resulted in the synthesis of a nonfunctional LPL enzyme establishing that the Ala----Thr substitution was the mutation responsible for the inactive LPL. The identification of this mutation in the LPL gene defines a region of the LPL enzyme, at Ala-176, that is essential for normal heparin-binding and catalytic activity. We propose that an amino acid substitution in this critical region of LPLBethesda results in the synthesis of a nonfunctional enzyme that leads to the chylomicronemia syndrome expressed in this proband.\r"

A quantitative HPLC method was used for saposin A, C, and D and a stimulation assay was used for saposin B. In normal tissues, saposin D was the most abundant of the four saposins. Massive accumulations of saposins, especially saposin A (about 80-fold increase over normal), were found in brain of patients with Tay-Sachs disease or infantile Sandhoff disease. In spleen of adult patients with Gaucher disease, saposin A and D accumulations (60- and 17-fold, respectively, over normal) were higher than that of saposin C (about 16-fold over normal). Similar massive accumulations of saposins A and D were found in liver of patients with fucosidosis (about 70- and 20-fold, respectively, over normal). Saposin D was the primary saposin stored in the liver of a patient with Niemann-Pick disease (about 30-fold over normal). Moderate increases of saposins B and D were found in a patient with GM1 gangliosidosis. Normal or near normal levels of all saposins were found in patients with Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Fabry disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, I-cell disease, mucopolysaccharidosis types 2 and 3B, or Jansky-Bielschowsky disease. The implications of the storage of saposins in these diseases are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrinolysis is regulated in part by the interaction between tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1, a serine protease inhibitor of the serpin family). It is known from our earlier work that deletion of a loop of amino acids (residues 296-302) from the serine protease domain of t-PA suppresses the interaction between the two proteins without altering the reactivity of t-PA towards its substrate, plasminogen. To define more precisely the role of individual residues within this loop, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace Lys-296, Arg-298, and Arg-299 with negatively charged glutamic residues. Replacement of all three positively charged amino acids generates a variant of t-PA that associates inefficiently with PAI-1 and is highly resistant to inhibition by the serpin. Two t-PAs with point mutations (Arg-298----Glu and Arg-299----Glu) are partially resistant to inhibition by PAI-1 and associate with the serpin at intermediate rates. Other point mutations (Lys-296----Glu, His-297----Glu, and Pro-301----Gly) do not detectably affect the interaction of t-PA with PAI-1. None of these substitutions has a significant effect on the rate of catalysis by t-PA or on the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, plasminogen. On the basis of these results, we propose a model in which positively charged residues located in a surface loop near the active site of t-PA form ionic bonds with complementary negatively charged residues C-terminal to the reactive center of PAI-1.\r"

Induction of the 46-kDa protein is transient but is slightly prolonged relative to c-Fos following growth stimulation. Using a mixed oligonucleotide probe encoding the peptide antigen, we have cloned the chicken genomic locus that encodes this protein and have determined its gene structure. This locus consists of four exons, each of which has some homology with the corresponding exons of the chicken c-fos gene, and it expresses a 6-kilobase mRNA after growth stimulation. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene (323 amino acids) contains a \"leucine zipper\" and includes five distinct regions that exhibit strong sequence homology to the recently identified fos-related antigens Fra-1 (rat) and FosB (mouse) as well as c-Fos. Since the other regions of the gene have little homology to any of these three proteins, this gene was named \"fra-2.\" When the fra-2 gene was overexpressed by an avian retrovirus vector, it caused transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts. The fra-2 gene product formed a complex in cells with the c-Jun protein, indicating that c-fos and fra-2 share biological and biochemical functions.\r"

The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which is normally transcytosed from the basolateral to the apical surface, was used as a model to dissect the signals that mediate this sorting event. When exogenous receptor was expressed in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, it was shown that phosphorylation of pIgR at the serine residue at position 664 is required for efficient transcytosis. Replacement of this serine with alanine generated a receptor that is transcytosed only slowly, and appears to be recycled. Conversely, substitution with aspartic acid (which mimics the negative charge of the phosphate group) results in rapid transcytosis. It was concluded that phosphorylation is the signal that directs the pIgR from the endosome into the transcytotic pathway.\r"

Because PN-II/APP is a potent protease inhibitor and possesses growth factor activity, these results implicate PN-II/APP in wound repair.

Comparison of baseline measurements revealed no significant differences in SMC, FBN, or PA. Both groups received similar doses of nonprotein energy and nitrogen. Baseline urea nitrogen excretion was slightly higher in the STD group (216 +/- 55 vs 268 +/- 54 mg/kg/day p = 0.049). Although NB was significantly improved over baseline during subsequent study days, there were no differences between groups after the day-1 measurement. SMC increased significantly from baseline on day 4 in the STD group, on day 7 in the HBC group, and on days 14 and 21 in both groups. There was no significant difference in SMC concentrations between groups on any day. Each group demonstrated a significant increase in PA from baseline on days 7, 14, and 21; however, no difference was seen when groups were compared. FBN increased significantly from baseline on day 14 in the HBC group and on days 7 and 14 in the STD group. FBN measurements were significantly different between groups on day 14 (STD, 179 +/- 71 vs HBC, 229 +/- 59 micrograms/ml; p less than 0.05). NB, PA, SMC, and FBN improve significantly during parenteral nutrition of traumatized patients.

Similar deposits were found within postmortem sclera in one case, but not in other ocular or extraocular tissues. The abnormal material was sensitive to testicular hyaluronidase and chondroitinase. The material reacted with monoclonal antibody 9-A-2 after digestion by chondroitinase AC in one case and ABC in both cases, which is consistent with the identification of the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Electron microscopic examination of the cornea in both cases disclosed granular material in vacuoles dispersed extracellularly and, rarely, in keratocytes. Results of blood and skin fibroblast enzyme assays for clinically relevant mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidoses were normal in both patients, and there were no somatic abnormalities suggesting a storage disease.\r"

The withdrawal of ventilation was achieved, when clinical criteria permitted, by reduction of the tidal volume preset on the jet ventilator in successive stages; this was effected by stepwise decreases in the jet driving pressure. This new mode of weaning at a constant rate of 50 breaths/minute is associated with minimum peak airway pressures. Synchronisation of the patient's breathing with the valveless ventilator is not required and weaning is tolerated well by the patient. Arterial oxygen tension and saturation were maintained throughout weaning and did not decline after extubation of the trachea.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, placebo, double-blind 6-month trial. PATIENTS: Thirty-eight patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes resistant to commonly used therapies (oral drugs, insulin, combination of insulin and oral drugs). INTERVENTIONS: Two study groups: one received insulin (n = 22) and the other, glibenclamide (n = 16). In each group, half of the patients were randomly allocated into two subgroups who continued the previous treatment but took either placebo tablets or hydroxychloroquine, 200 mg three times a day. The four subgroups were as follows: insulin and placebo (n = 11); insulin and hydroxychloroquine (n = 11); glibenclamide and placebo (n = 8); and glibenclamide and hydroxychloroquine (n = 8). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 6 months, relevant and statistically significant improvement occurred in the 11 patients who received the insulin and hydroxychloroquine (glucose profile decrease, -11.7 mmol/L; 95% CI, -13.9 to -9.5, P = 0.001; glycated hemoglobin A1c decrease, -3.3%; 95% CI, -3.9 to -2.7, P = 0.001). No significant changes were seen in patients on placebo. The daily insulin dose in patients treated with the combined insulin and hydroxychloroquine therapy had to be reduced an average of 30%. No important side effects were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Combining antidiabetic therapy with hydroxychloroquine in decompensated, treatment-refractory patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes may help to break the vicious circle of hyperglycemia and lead to better management of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in non-SLE disorders, and to evaluate the clinical significance of these autoantibodies as they relate to thromboembolic events, neuropsychiatric disorders, thrombocytopenia, and fetal loss. DATA IDENTIFICATION: A computer-assisted search of the literature (MEDLINE, 1966 to 1989) and review of the bibliographies of all identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Series of ten or more subjects were included if the assays used for detecting lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin met the specified minimal criteria for validity. DATA EXTRACTION: Series were categorized according to antibody type and underlying disease. A systematic appraisal of patient selection methods, study design, and assay methods was done. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: An analysis of 29 published series (comprising over 1000 patients with SLE) yielded an average frequency of 34% for the lupus anticoagulant and 44% for anticardiolipin. Antiphospholipid antibodies are also prevalent in patients with various non-SLE disorders. In patients with SLE, a statistically significant association exists between the presence of either antibody and a history of thrombosis, neurologic disorders, or thrombocytopenia. The available data suggest, but do not firmly support, an association between antiphospholipid antibodies and history of fetal loss in women with SLE. Contrary to prevailing opinion, none of these associations have been shown conclusively in patients with non-SLE disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The results of predominantly retrospective series suggest that for certain persons (patients with SLE or closely related disorders) antiphospholipid antibodies may be important risk factors for thrombosis, neurologic disease, thrombocytopenia, and fetal loss. Standardized tests for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin, as well as long-term, prospective clinical studies, are needed to determine the prognostic value of antiphospholipid antibodies.\r"

The regimens compared were 200 mg for 10 days (n = 20), 400 mg for 10 days (n = 21), and 600 mg for 10 days (n = 21). Forty-five patients were evaluable for efficacy. A clinical cure was reached in 78% of the patients. Overall, a favorable bacteriological response (negative culture or reinfection at 4 to 6 weeks) was obtained in 36 of 45 (80%) patients. No significant difference could be found among the three dosage groups. During therapy, one Klebsiella ozaenae strain became resistant and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain became less susceptible to fleroxacin. In 13 patients, therapy had to be discontinued due to major adverse events (oliguria [n = 1], psychosis [n = 1], photosensitivity [n = 1], insomnia [n = 1], and nausea [n = 9]). Minor side effects were seen in 13 other patients. Increased dosage correlated significantly (P less than 0.01) with total number of adverse events.\r"

  ".U": "90240699\r", 
  ".W": "Erythromycin binds to a single site on the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and perturbs protein synthesis. However, erythromycin contains desosamine and thus exists in both protonated (greater than 96%) and neutral (less than 4%) forms at physiological pH because of the pKa of the dimethylamino group. We therefore examined the relative roles of both forms in binding to ribosomes isolated from two species each of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We developed a system to directly measure the forward (association) rate constant of formation of the macrolide-ribosome complex, and we have measured both the forward and reverse (dissociation) rate constants as a function of pH. Forward rate constants and binding affinity did not correlate with pH when the interaction of erythromycin with ribosomes from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was examined, demonstrating that the protonated form of this macrolide binds to ribosomes. Conversely, the neutral form of macrolide cannot be the sole binding species and appears to bind with the same kinetics as the protonated form. Forward rate constants were 3- to 4-fold greater at physiological pH, and binding affinity calculated from rate constants was 5- to 10-fold greater than previously estimated. Similar results were obtained with azithromycin, a novel 15-membered macrolide that contains an additional tertiary amine in the macrolide ring. Ribosome- and macrolide-specific kinetic parameters were demonstrated at neutral pH and may be related to the potency of the two macrolides against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.\r"

Titres in patients with and without cystic fibrosis and with no pseudomonal infection were low (less than 105 to less than 261). Titres in patients with cystic fibrosis who were chronically infected with P aeruginosa were very high (1200-163,000), and patients who grew the organism intermittently had intermediate titres. Longitudinal studies suggested increasing tissue invasion or involvement of the lower respiratory tract, or both, with increasing time of infection and identified patients with a good prognosis after the onset of pseudomonal infection. Detection of an increased serum IgA titre can give an earlier indication than measurement of the serum IgG titre of the presence of P aeruginosa in the respiratory tract in a proportion of patients. IgA measurement seems to be better than IgG measurement at predicting the reappearance of P aeruginosa after apparent eradication of early infection. These results suggest that this assay may be a valuable additional indicator of the presence of P aeruginosa at the beginning of infection, and of the reappearance of the organism after treatment in the early stages of infection.\r"

Two small spindle cell nodules were located in the region of Auerbach's myenteric plexus and a third larger tumor produced a subserosal mass. The immunohistochemical profile of these tumors revealed that they were actin and S100-protein negative but positive for neuron-specific enolase. At the ultrastructural level, the tumors recapitulated features of Auerbach's plexus. These lesions are similar to previously described gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumors, and we propose that this may be the site of origin of enteric stromal tumors in von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis.\r"

Postoperatively, one eye received a 0.1-mL injection of tissue plasminogen activator (25 micrograms); the other received balanced salt solution. The eyes receiving tissue plasminogen activator had a 28% incidence of increased anterior chamber blood and a 61% incidence of increased intravitreal blood. There was no evidence of postinjection bleeding in eyes receiving balanced salt solution. Most cases of bleeding occurred within 24 hours of tissue plasminogen activator injection. Administration of tissue plasminogen activator in the setting of segmented blood vessels may lead to intraocular hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "The sealed source operational policies employed at the Bristol Radiotherapy and Oncology Centre were originally designed to meet the requirements of the 1972 Code of Practice by ensuring that individual personnel doses were kept below the relevant quarterly and annual dose limits. In 1982-1983, measures were taken to improve personnel radiation safety within the brachytherapy treatment facility by (a) making preparations for the introduction of Selectron medium-dose-rate (MDR) afterloading systems at the centre for intracavitary brachytherapy and (b) reviewing the operational policies to ensure that they meet the more stringent requirements of the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle, a principle subsequently embodied in the 1985 UK ionising Radiations Regulations (IRR 85). When considering the implications of making existing single-bedded side wards, originally designed for low-dose-rate brachytherapy and suitable for the new systems, the cost of the extra protection required to reduce the instantaneous dose rate in the ward corridors adjacent to the treatment room to less than 7.5 microSv h-1 had to be determined. On the basis of the cost-benefit analysis, it was decided not to provide additional shielding but rather to introduce administrative controls based on local rules which contained systems of work and the operational policies for the afterloading systems. After using the MDR afterloading systems for 2 years, a period in which there has also been a marked increase in interstitial brachytherapy, an analysis was made of the doses received by nursing staff over the past 8 years. This has shown that, in spite of higher dose rates in the corridor areas because of the use of an MDR system and the increase in interstitial techniques, the doses to ward nurses have been significantly reduced by encouraging staff to comply with the ALARA principle and the introduction of afterloading systems.\r"

  ".U": "90242536\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium has been implicated as a mediator of cell injury in ischemia and reperfusion, but direct measurements of Ca2+ are required to refine this idea. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the Ca2+ indicator 5F-BAPTA to measure [Ca2+]i in perfused ferret hearts. Several lines of evidence are presented to show that loading with the acetoxymethyl ester of 5F-BAPTA is not significantly complicated by accumulation of partially de-esterified metabolites, compartmentalization into mitochondria, or disproportionate uptake into endothelial cells. During 20 minutes of total global ischemia at 30 degrees C, time-averaged [Ca2+]i increased significantly, reaching peak values roughly three times control at 15-20 minutes. Reperfusion resulted in a persistent elevation of [Ca2+]i during the first 5 minutes, but not afterward. Although the nonlinear response of 5F-BAPTA to [Ca2+] leads to underestimation of the true time-averaged [Ca2+]i, the measured alterations of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis during ischemia are large compared with the likely errors in quantification. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of 5F-BAPTA-loaded hearts reveals changes during ischemia similar to those recorded previously in hearts not containing a Ca2+ indicator. Developed pressure recovers to only 50% of control values during reflow, indicating that the presence of 5F-BAPTA in the cytosol does not protect against stunning, at least when the extracellular calcium concentration has been raised to 8 mM. We conclude that 5F-BAPTA provides useful measurements that reveal that time-averaged [Ca2+]i rises during ischemia and returns to control levels soon after reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown in genetic myopathic hamsters that cardiac myofibrillar ATPase regulation by calcium is altered and that there are shifts in myosin isozyme distribution (V1----V3) suggesting abnormalities in multiple components of the contractile apparatus. To focus more on the regulatory proteins (troponin and tropomyosin), individual proteins of the skeletal and cardiac actomyosin system were reconstituted under controlled conditions. In this way, myosin plus actin and troponin-tropomyosin from the normal and myopathic animals could be studied enzymatically. The proteins were isolated from the skeletal or cardiac muscle of random-bred control and cardiomyopathic hamsters (BIO 53:58) at 7 months of age. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoretic patterns indicated differences in the troponin I and troponin C regions of myopathic skeletal muscle, but cardiac samples from control and myopathic hamsters showed similarities in their mobilities. This suggests the possibility of different cardiac isozymes in the regulatory protein complex, as reported in our previous studies of cardiac myosin in cardiomyopathy. Calcium sensitivity was markedly decreased in the actomyosin reconstituted with troponin-tropomyosin from skeletal as well as cardiac muscle from myopathic animals. In summary, our data show that the regulatory proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscle of the myopathic hamsters have decreased inhibitory action on Mg2(+)-actomyosin ATPase activity. This loss of calcium regulation along with shifts in cardiac myosin heavy chain may be partially responsible for the impaired cardiac function in the hearts of myopathic hamsters.\r"

Taprostene (100 ng/kg/min) was infused intravenously starting 30 minutes postocclusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by reperfusion 1 hour later, and the cats were observed for an additional 4.5 hours. Taprostene infusion resulted in significantly lower plasma creatine phosphokinase activities at every time from 3 to 6 hours for the MI + taprostene group compared with the MI + vehicle group and were not significantly different when compared with sham MI controls. The areas at risk, expressed as a percentage of the total left ventricular weights, were not significantly different between the MI groups. However, the necrotic area expressed as a percentage of the myocardial area at risk was significantly lower in the taprostene-treated cats compared with the untreated MI group (p less than 0.01). Cardiac myeloperoxidase activities indicated that significantly fewer neutrophils were attracted to the area at risk and to the ischemic zone of the MI + taprostene cats when compared with the MI cats given only the vehicle. Data from isolated left anterior descending coronary artery ring preparations removed from hearts after 6 hours of ischemia indicated that the endothelium was damaged by ischemia-reperfusion injury in the untreated cats. However, endothelial dysfunction was not observed in circumflex coronary arteries of ischemic cats or in coronary rings isolated from MI + taprostene cats. Thus, taprostene exerted a significant cardioprotection in cats subjected to ischemia and reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90242547\r", 
  ".W": "Elucidation of the role of (elevated) endogenous atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in chronic heart failure has been hampered by a lack of specific inhibitors. We used a newly developed monoclonal antibody that has been shown to specifically block both exogenously and endogenously released ANF in vivo. For assessment of the vasodilatory action of ANF in chronic heart failure, either this antibody against ANF or ascites (control serum) was injected in rats with myocardial infarction and failure and in sham animals. Ascites did not alter central hemodynamics in either the sham or infarcted group. Antibody significantly increased right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in the infarction group but did not affect these variables in the sham group. Because renal blood flow, as measured by radioactive microspheres, decreased significantly in all four groups, probably due to nonspecific renal vasoconstrictor effects of the ascites, a separate group of infarcted animals was treated with purified ANF antibody (devoid of nonspecific effects) or mouse IgG as a control injection. In these animals, right atrial pressure increased from 1.1 +/- 0.7 to 2.6 +/- 0.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Although SVR, renal blood flow velocity (measured by Doppler probe), and renal vascular resistance did not change in the infarcted animals after administration of purified ANF antibody, a significant correlation was found between baseline plasma ANF values and the change in SVR exerted by purified ANF antibody (r = 0.758, p less than 0.02, n = 9); that is, SVR increased in rats with high baseline plasma ANF (greater than 350 pg/ml), but decreased in animals with plasma ANF less than 200 pg/ml. These results suggest that moderately elevated endogenous plasma ANF levels in chronic heart failure do affect central hemodynamics, primarily by reducing venous pressure (e.g., by decreasing intravascular volume or by venous dilation). Arterial vasodilation, however, appears to emerge when plasma ANF is greatly increased.\r"

An overall treatment success rate of 95% (47 of 50 patients) was achieved. Two patients had elective surgical treatment and a third underwent surgery for perforation secondary to dilation. A total of three patients complained of post-procedure chest pain within 4 hours and were hospitalized. Two had perforations; one required surgical repair.

Verapamil (120 mg, three times daily) was administered orally for 1 week. In all subjects both basal and TRH-stimulated PRL levels were markedly elevated by verapamil. The average diurnal PRL concentration was increased from 13.0 +/- 2.0 micrograms/L to 25.2 +/- 4.4 (mean +/- SE; P = 0.02). Diurnal rhythm and pulsatility of PRL secretion were seen both before and during verapamil administration. Mean peak PRL concentrations after TRH injection (200 micrograms, iv) were significantly increased from 72.6 +/- 11.6 to 115.2 +/- 16.8 (P less than 0.01), and the mean area under the PRL concentration-time curves from 4332 +/- 962 micrograms/L.120 min to 6975 +/- 1334 (P = 0.01). The data are in striking contrast with previous findings from in vitro studies where verapamil has been reported to block calcium-mediated stimulus-secretion coupling and inhibit hormone secretion from pituitary cells. Interference with other PRL-regulating mechanisms may account for the demonstrated verapamil-induced PRL secretion in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that in the pregnant human myometrium the binding sites labeled with [3H]idazoxan have the pharmacological characteristics of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Competitive experiments have also revealed that the stable guanine nucleotide analog guanyl-5'-imidodiphosphate decreases the apparent affinity of norepinephrine and clonidine for myometrial [3H]idazoxan-binding sites. In the present study, the alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism in this tissue was further approached by measuring adenylate cyclase responses and examining the different pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. The two alpha 2-adrenergic agonists norepinephrine and clonidine inhibited adenylate cyclase activity in both the outer and inner layers of the pregnant human myometrium. The inhibitory effect of these agonists is completely reversed by alpha 2-adrenergic antagonists such as yohimbine and idazoxan. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin completely suppresses the inhibition of adenylate cyclase mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, suggesting that an inhibitory protein of the Gi type is involved. Pertussis toxin, known to catalyze the ADP ribosylation of the alpha-subunit of several G-proteins, labels three substrates at 39, 40, and 41 kDa. The more intense labeling occurring on the 40- to 41-kDa components are assigned to alpha-subunits of Gi-like proteins, whereas that at 39 kDa might correspond to a Go alpha-like substrate. These results indicate the presence of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the human myometrium at the end of pregnancy that are functionally linked to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity via the Gi protein.\r"

  ".W": "Serum TSH and PRL levels and their response to TRH were measured in 11 patients with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH), 6 euthyroid subjects, and 6 patients with primary hypothyroidism. TSH and PRL levels and their response to TRH were also measured after the consecutive administration of 50, 100, and 200 micrograms T3 daily, each for a period of 3 days. Using a sensitive TSH assay, all GRTH patients had TSH values that were elevated or within the normal range. On the basis of a normal or elevated TSH level, GRTH patients were classified as GRTH-N1 TSH (5 patients) or GRTH-Hi TSH (6 patients), respectively. Only GRTH patients with previous thyroid ablative therapy had basal TSH values greater than 20 mU/L. TSH responses, in terms of percent increment above baseline, were appropriate for the basal TSH level in all subjects. No GRTH patient had an elevated basal PRL level. PRL responses to TRH were significantly increased only in the hypothyroid controls compared to values in all other groups. On 50 micrograms T3, 7 of 12 (58%) nonresistant (euthyroid and hypothyroid) and 1 of 11 (9%) resistant subjects had a greater than 75% suppression of the TSH response to TRH. On the same T3 dose, 2 of 12 (17%) nonresistant and 4 of 11 (36%) resistant subjects had a greater than 50% suppression of the PRL response to TRH. On 200 micrograms T3, all subjects, except for 1 with GRTH, had a greater than 75% suppression of the TSH response to TRH. On the same T3 dose, while 11 of 12 (92%) nonresistant subjects had a greater than 50% reduction of the PRL response to TRH, only 3 of 10 (30%) resistant patients showed this degree of suppression (P less than 0.005). Without previous ablative therapy, serum TSH in patients with GRTH is usually normal or mildly elevated. The TSH response to TRH is proportional to the basal TSH level and is suppressed by exogenous T3. However, on 200 micrograms T3 basal TSH was not detectable (less than 0.1 mU/L) in all euthyroid subjects, but it was measurable in three of four GRTH patients with normal TSH levels before T3 treatment. PRL levels in GRTH are normal even when TSH is elevated. The PRL response to TRH is not increased in GRTH. In all subjects, exogenous T3 suppresses the PRL response to TRH to a lesser degree than the TSH response, but this difference is much greater in patients with GRTH.\r"

  ".U": "90243836\r", 
  ".W": "Obesity is associated with an impairment of the GH secretion elicited by all stimuli known to date, but the basic mechanism of this alteration is unknown. To determine whether obesity is associated with a chronic state of tonic somatostatin secretion, several tests with GH stimuli with or without pyridostigmine were undertaken in both obese subjects and matched controls. Pyridostigmine reduces somatostatin release from the hypothalamus by increasing central cholinergic neurotransmission. The administration of clonidine (300 micrograms, orally) to obese subjects did not modify basal GH values (1.9 +/- 0.7 micrograms/L at 90 min), while in control subjects the clonidine-induced GH peak was 13.1 +/- 1.6 micrograms/L. Pretreatment with pyridostigmine (120 mg, orally) notably increased clonidine-stimulated GH secretion in both the obese (6.9 +/- 1.8 micrograms/L) and control (17.6 +/- 2.7 micrograms/L) subjects. Since clonidine acts by releasing endogenous GHRH, similar studies were undertaken employing arginine, which presumably enhances GH release by reducing somatostatin discharge. Arginine administration in obese subjects induced an increase in GH levels of 5 +/- 2.3 micrograms/L, which was significantly smaller than that in the matched control subjects (13.3 +/- 2.4 micrograms/L). Pretreatment with pyridostigmine increased the arginine action toward a GH peak of 12.2 +/- 2.2 micrograms/L in the obese and 21.6 +/- 2.5 micrograms/L in control subjects. As a third hypothalamic stimulus of GH secretion, trials of insulin-induced hypoglycemia were carried out. Hypoglycemia induced an increase in GH levels in obese subjects of 12.2 +/- 1.8 micrograms/L, which was higher than that produced by any other stimulus, but lower than that in control subjects (28.4 +/- 5.5 micrograms/L). In contrast with the previous two GH stimuli, pretreatment with pyridostigmine did not modify the hypoglycemia-induced GH release in either obese or normal subjects. Our results lend support to the view that clonidine acts through GH-releasing hormone release and arginine by reducing somatostatin discharge from the hypothalamus. In addition, they seem to indicate that hypoglycemia acts by a combination of both mechanisms, mainly through a reduction in somatostatin release. These findings support the idea that obesity is associated with a state of chronic somatostatin hypersecretion as the basis for the derangements in GH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "In man, continuous infusion of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) does not sustain GH secretion, unlike prolonged hypoglycemia. To further evaluate this difference in the stimulation of GH release we measured GH concentrations for 3 h during prolonged insulin-induced hypoglycemia and GHRH-(1-29)NH2 (100 micrograms/h) infusion in normal individuals. We also assessed the GH response to combined and separate administration of insulin and GHRH. Plasma GH levels increased during prolonged hypoglycemia and remained elevated for the third hour (22-24 micrograms/L). GH concentrations increased during GHRH infusion, peaked at 60 min (23.5 micrograms/L), and rapidly declined. Thus, our findings confirmed that prolonged hypoglycemia, unlike GHRH infusion, sustained elevated GH levels and that these high levels did not appear to influence GH secretion from the pituitary. Changes in FFA did not account for the sustained GH secretion. FFA levels initially declined during insulin infusion, but after 3 h of hypoglycemia they returned to near-basal values (basal, 0.1 +/- 0.02 g/L; 180 min, 0.09 +/- 0.02). The maximal GH concentration attained during the combined insulin and GHRH test was significantly higher than that with the insulin tolerance test or GHRH test (insulin plus GHRH, 71.9 +/- 13.5; insulin tolerance test, 34.2 +/- 2.9; P less than 0.025; GHRH test, 27.9 +/- 3.2; P less than 0.02), indicating an additive effect on GH secretion. These data suggest that insulin-induced hypoglycemia stimulates GH secretion through a mechanism partly independent of GHRH. The release from somatostatin inhibition and stimulation through other neuropeptides (e.g. galanin) is suggested as possible causes of hypoglycemia-induced GH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "To examine a possible role for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in water and sodium metabolism disturbances associated with abnormal vasopressin (AVP) secretion, we measured plasma ANP concentrations in 15 patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and in 17 patients with central diabetes insipidus (DI). The mean plasma ANP concentration (30.2 +/- 10.4 pmol/L) in SIADH patients who had hyponatremia, plasma hypoosmolality, hyperosmolar urinary compared to plasma sodium levels, and increased plasma AVP levels relative to plasma osmolality was significantly higher than that in normal subjects (12.6 +/- 4.9 pmol/L), although there was a considerable individual variation in plasma ANP ranging from normal to clearly elevated levels (15.1-47.0 pmol/L). When hyponatremia was corrected by water restriction or demeclocycline administration, plasma ANP levels decreased significantly and fell into the normal range (12.5 +/- 4.3 pmol/L). DI patients who complained of polyuria and polydipsia and had hypoosmolar urine, normal or elevated plasma sodium concentrations, and decreased plasma AVP levels relative to plasma osmolality, on the other hand, had a significantly lower mean plasma ANP level (7.6 +/- 2.9 pmol/L) than normal subjects. There was, again, a considerable overlap between plasma ANP levels in individual DI patients (4.2-13.9 pmol/L) and those in normal subjects. Treatment with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin resulted in a significant increase in the mean plasma ANP level (18.6 +/- 8.0 pmol/L). There were no significant correlations between plasma ANP and AVP levels in either group of patients. The results indicate that ANP secretion is modulated by changes in plasma volume consequent to abnormal AVP secretion, which may have a pathophysiological significance in maintaining volume homeostasis.\r"

Despite an increase in gastric inhibitory polypeptide concentration during combined enteral and iv glucose infusion to levels that mimicked meal ingestion, total glucose infusion rate, insulin-induced stimulation of glucose uptake, and insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose release were comparable to those observed during iv glucose administration.

Before treatment the mean serum inhibin concentration in the 20 hypogonadotropic men as a group (391 +/- 49 U/L) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) than that in 27 normal men (741 +/- 52 U/L). In the 7 men whose hypogonadism was of postpubertal onset, the mean serum inhibin concentration (559 +/- 69 U/L) was not significantly lower than that in normal men. In the 13 men whose hypogonadism was of prepubertal onset, the serum inhibin level was significantly lower [381 +/- 74 U/L (P less than 0.01) in the 7 without a history of cryptorchidism and 207 +/- 46 U/L (P less than 0.01) in the 6 with a history of cryptorchidism]. All 20 patients were azoospermic or severely oligospermic and had distinctly subnormal serum testosterone concentrations, even those whose serum inhibin values were normal. In the 7 patients with postpubertal hypogonadism, treatment with hCG alone for 6 months increased the serum testosterone concentration and maximum sperm count to normal, even though the previously normal inhibin concentration was not increased further. In the 13 patients with prepubertal hypogonadism, treatment with hCG alone increased the serum inhibin concentration, and combined treatment with hCG and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) increased inhibin further, to well within the normal range (742 +/- 143 U/L) in the patients without a history of cryptorchidism and to just within the normal range (487 +/- 96 U/L) in those with such a history. In the 7 patients with prepubertal hypogonadism but no history of cryptorchidism, treatment with hCG and hMG increased the maximum sperm count to normal in 5. In the 6 patients with prepubertal hypogonadism who did have a history of cryptorchidism, hCG and hMG treatment produced a normal sperm count in only 1. Of 12 patients whose serum inhibin level was more than 300 U/L before treatment, 11 developed a normal maximum sperm count in response to treatment, but of 8 patients whose inhibin concentration was less than 300 U/L before treatment, only 2 developed a normal sperm count in response to treatment (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90243847\r", 
  ".W": "Serum levels of osteocalcin [OC; bone Gla protein (BGP)] and bone alkaline phosphatase (B-AP) are both correlated to osteoblastic activity, which may be regulated by several hormones, including estrogen, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], and PTH. Estrogen shows reproducible variations during the menstrual cycle, while available data on variations in serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 and serum immunoreactive PTH show midcyclic increases or no changes. In the present study we evaluated osteoblastic activity by measuring serum OC and B-AP during the menstrual cycle in eight healthy women, aged 20-47 yr. The cycles were synchronized by LH peaks, and follicular and luteal periods were normalized by lengths. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that serum OC varied significantly (P less than 0.05), with highest levels during the luteal period. Although the same pattern was seen for serum B-AP, the variation just failed to reach significance (P less than 0.10), but the mean level was significantly higher during the luteal than during the follicular period (P less than 0.05). Gonadotropins and ovarian sex hormones showed significant variations. There were no significant changes in serum vitamin D-binding protein, serum total and free 1,25-(OH)2D3 index, or serum immunoreactive PTH-(1-84), but serum levels of somatomedin-C showed a significant variation, with the highest level during the luteal period (P less than 0.05). Blood levels and urinary excretion of minerals exhibited no significant variations. Cross-correlation studies between OC and estradiol showed the highest correlation coefficient, when OC was lagged about 7 days after estradiol (r = 0.69; P less than 0.05). Moreover, a high correlation was found between OC and somatomedin-C when matched at concurrent time points (r = 0.76; P less than 0.01). No significant correlations were found between the other calcium-regulating hormones and OC when matched at concurrent time points. In conclusion, we found a significant effect of the menstrual cycle on the serum levels of two osteoblastic bone markers, OC and B-AP. The changes indicated that osteoblastic activity is higher during the luteal period. However, whether the changes are caused by direct or indirect effects of the fluctuations in calciotropic hormones is still unresolved.\r"

To determine the mechanism of suppression of gonadotropin secretion we studied the effects of a single dose of a LHRH antagonist on the pulsatile activity of serum bioactive LH (Bio-LH), immunoreactive LH (IR-LH), alpha-subunit, and testosterone for 24 h in normal men. The LHRH antagonist, Nal-Glu [( Ac-D2Nal1,D4ClPhe2,D3Pal3,Arg5,DGlu6-(AA), DAla10]LHRH) was given as a single sc injection of 5 mg to five normal men. Blood samples were collected every 10 min during a 10-h baseline period and for 14 h after administration of the antagonist. IR-LH, alpha-subunit, and testosterone were measured in triplicate, and Bio-LH in duplicate. Pulses were then evaluated using Cluster analysis; all replicates were entered in the pulse analysis. After administration of the Nal-Glu antagonist, IR-LH levels decreased (P less than 0.001) from 2.81 +/- 0.06 at baseline to a nadir of 0.75 +/- 0.02 U/L. Bio-LH levels followed the same pattern, decreasing by 89% (P less than 0.001) from 4.54 +/- 0.13 to a nadir of 0.51 +/- 0.13 U/L 6.8 h after the injection of Nal-Glu. In contrast, serum alpha-subunit levels did not change (P greater than 0.05) during the 14-h period after antagonist administration (0.85 +/- 0.01 and 0.75 +/- 0.01 microgram/L before and after Nal-Glu, respectively). Serum testosterone levels decreased by more than 80%, from 17.6 +/- 0.2 at baseline to a mean nadir of 3.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/L 12.8 h after Nal-Glu administration. Pulse frequency and the number of significant pulses remained the same for all of the measured hormones during the 10-h baseline period and the 14 h after Nal-Glu administration. In contrast, the pulse amplitude of IR-LH, Bio-LH, and testosterone decreased significantly after injection of the antagonist. The pulse amplitude of the alpha-subunit also declined, albeit not significantly. Coincidence analysis revealed that during both the 10-h baseline and the 14-h post-Nal-Glu period there was a highly significant (P less than 10(-5) nonrandom synchrony between peaks of IR-LH, Bio-LH, alpha-subunit, and testosterone. These results suggest that coordinate pulsatile secretion of IR-LH, Bio-LH, and testosterone persists after the administration of 5 mg Nal-Glu LHRH antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A major challenge facing clinical dietitians today is justifying inpatient clinical nutrition services. To meet this challenge, a comprehensive program for the delivery and management of clinical nutrition services was developed at Yale-New Haven Hospital. It is based on seven nutritional risk factors--age, diagnosis/treatment, diet, metabolic or mechanical problems, significant lab values, pertinent medications, and weight for height. These risk factors are used to categorize patients into one of seven classifications. In essence, this classification system is the screening tool used to provide the foundation for standards of practice and nutrition assessment and intervention. The inherent advantage of such a program is that it identifies patients at high nutritional risk, regardless of wide variations in patient population or diagnosis. It also provides standardized criteria for evaluating quality of care, patient acuity, and productivity and staffing. Clinical nutrition services can then be measured for both quality and quantity. Because protein-calorie malnutrition poses a serious threat to cost containment and quality patient care, this type of program can appeal to hospital administrators, physicians, and site visitors alike. It can serve as an adaptable model for the delivery and management of inpatient clinical nutrition services in a wide variety of health care facilities.\r"

The current study examines the effect of fibronectin and heparin binding growth factor-type 1 on platelet adhesion and activation in vivo and on platelet aggregation in vitro. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses (5 cm x 4 mm internal diameter) were treated either with fibronectin (n = 9), fibronectin/heparin/heparin binding growth factor-type 1/heparin (n = 12), or neither (n = 13) and were interposed into canine aortoiliac systems bilaterally. Autogenous radiolabeled (Indium 111 oxine, 650 microCi) platelets were injected intravenously before reestablishment of circulation. Perfusion was maintained for 30 minutes, and prostheses were removed with segments of native aorta and distal iliac arteries bilaterally. Specimens were examined for thrombus-free surface area, by gamma well counting for adherent radiolabeled platelets, and by light microscopy and transmission and scanning electron microscopic techniques. Results showed that both the fibronectin and fibronectin/heparin/heparin binding growth factor-type 1/heparin pretreated prostheses contained significantly greater numbers of platelets and adherent radioactivity than did control graft segments when normalized to their ipsilateral iliac arteries. Fibronectin/heparin/heparin binding growth factor-type 1/heparin pretreated prostheses contained 27 +/- 16 times more radioactivity per square millimeter than ipsilateral iliac arteries, fibronectin pretreated prostheses had 13 +/- 8 times more radioactivity per square millimeter than ipsilateral iliac arteries, and untreated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene had 4 +/- 3 times more radioactivity per square millimeter than ipsilateral iliac arteries. Fibronectin/heparin/heparin binding growth factor-type 1/heparin was more radioactive than fibronectin alone (p = 0.056). Histologic evaluation and thrombus-free surface area determinations corroborated the gamma well counting data. Platelet aggregation in vitro was not activated by either fibronectin (1 to 100 micrograms/100 microliters) or heparin binding growth factor-type 1 (25 to 2500 ng/100 microliters). These data suggest that fibronectin and heparin binding growth factor-type 1 promote platelet adhesion not aggregation.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells using quantitative chemiluminescence techniques have shown that the amount of nitric oxide released under basal conditions, or in response to either bradykinin or the calcium ionophore A23187 is insufficient to account for the vasorelaxant activities of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) derived from the same source. This observation contradicts previous suggestions that nitric oxide and EDRF are the same compound, but may be explained if EDRF is a compound that contains nitric oxide within its structure but is a much more potent vasodilator than nitric oxide. Such a molecule could be one of several nitrosothiols which may yield nitric oxide after a one-electron reduction. The present experiments were carried out to test the possibility that the biological activities of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor might more closely resemble those of one of these compounds, S-nitrosocysteine, than nitric oxide. Nitric oxide release from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells was detected by chemiluminescence and bioassay experiments compared the vasodilator potencies of nitric oxide, S-nitrosocysteine, and EDRF. The results suggest that EDRF is much more likely to be a nitrosylated compound such as a nitrosothiol than authentic nitric oxide.\r"

  ".W": "There is an urgent need to preserve the ever-increasing number (greater than 30,000) of different genetic strains of D. melanogaster that are maintained in national and international stock centres and in the laboratories of individual investigators. In all cases, the stocks are maintained as adult populations and require transfer to fresh medium every two to four weeks. This is not only costly in terms of materials, labour and space, but unique strains are vulnerable to accidental loss, contamination, and changes in genotype that can occur during continuous culture through mutation, genetic drift or selection. Although cryopreservation of Drosophila germ-plasm would be an enormous advantage, many attempts using conventional procedures have been unsuccessful. D. melanogaster embryos are refractory to conventional cryopreservation procedures because of the contravening conditions required to minimize mortality resulting from both intracellular ice formation and chilling injury at subzero temperatures. To overcome these obstacles, we have developed a vitrification procedure that precludes intracellular ice formation so that the embryos can be cooled and warmed at ultra-rapid rates to minimize chilling injury, and have recovered viable embryos following storage in liquid nitrogen. In a series of 53 experiments, a total of 3,711 larvae emerged from 17,280 eggs that were cooled in liquid nitrogen (18.4 +/- 8.8%). Further, using a subset from this population, approximately 3% of the surviving larvae (24/800) developed into adults. These adults were fertile and produced an F1 generation.\r"

Members of the latter group, which includes Rickettsia, Shigellae, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Listeria monocytogenes, possess haemolytic activity associated with the ability to enter the host cytoplasm. Therefore mutants of L. monocytogenes lacking a pore-forming haemolysin, listeriolysin O, do not escape from the endosomal compartment and consequently fail to become established in the cytoplasm. To examine the role of listeriolysin O, we cloned the structural gene for the L. monocytogenes haemolysin, hlyA, into an asporogenic mutant of Bacillus subtilis under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. After being internalized by the macrophage-like cell line J774, haemolytic B. subtilis disrupted the phagosomal membrane and grew rapidly within the macrophage cytoplasm. These results show that a single gene product is sufficient to convert a common soil bacterium into a parasite that can grow in the cytoplasm of a mammalian cell.\r"

P. aeruginosa showed significant adherence to contact lenses in vitro. In contrast, S. aureus failed to show significant adherence to contact lenses in vitro (i.e., the radioactive uptake was not significantly above background). The extent of adherence of Pseudomonas was proportional to the number of focal deposits on the lenses. Results of electron microscopic examination showed the bacteria to be adherent primarily to large focal deposits (greater than or equal to 150 microns). There was no pseudomonal adherence to the small focal deposits (less than or equal to 50 microns) and little adherence to the areas in between the focal deposits. The authors hypothesize that worn lenses, especially those with large focal deposits, serve as a vehicle for the transport of P. aeruginosa to the cornea. This hypothesis could be a partial explanation for the high incidence of keratitis caused by P. aeruginosa in EWSCL patients.\r"

In the majority of patients, the diagnosis is made tentatively by chemistry profiles that show elevated serum calcium. It is confirmed by repeated serum calcium values and PTH determination. The parathyroid abnormality, if an adenoma, can usually be localized preoperatively by thallium-technetium scan, ultrasound, or computed tomography. In the case of persistent disease with hypercalcemia, an angiogram with selective venous sampling for PTH is helpful. At exploration, both sides of the neck may need exploration. A unilateral procedure may be sufficient, if the preoperative localization tests are confirmatory and if biopsy of another \"normal\" gland shows normal histologic findings. During the postoperative period, suction drains will lessen the likelihood of hematoma formation and serum calcium levels are monitored for the first 3 to 5 days. Symptomatic patients with low calcium levels receive intravenous and oral calcium supplements until values are brought to the low-normal range. Supplements are tapered as the calcium in the serum rises. The majority of patients who undergo parathyroid surgery will benefit both symptomatically and metabolically.\r"

The analysis was done from the perspective of society as a whole. The economic costs of H. influenzae type b disease in the 1988 United States birth cohort would be $2.546 billion (1988 U.S. dollars) in the absence of preventive efforts. If 60% of all children could be vaccinated with PRP-D or HbOC at 18 months of age, this strategy would save $207.1 million ($88.22 savings/vaccinee; $43,605 cost/case prevented; 3.57/1 benefit-to-cost ratio) under base case model assumptions. Universal PRP-D or HbOC vaccination at 18 months of age would prevent 1845 cases of invasive H. influenzae type b disease. The break-even efficacy for universal PRP-D or HbOC vaccination at 18 months of age was 22.7%. We conclude that, under the model base case assumptions, universal PRP-D or HbOC vaccination at 18 months of age is sufficiently efficacious so that the costs of vaccination would be more than offset by decreased medical care costs for treating H. influenzae type b disease.\r"

  ".W": "VADs are indicated for many persons who require reliable long-term venous access. Nontunneled, tunneled, and venous access ports are constructed of silicone or polyurethane, the most biocompatible materials identified thus far. These devices are inserted in a similar fashion and are extremely versatile. Although VADs represent a major advance in catheter technology, they are not without problems. The most serious and frequently reported complications include infection, thrombosis, and extravasation. Catheter occlusions are another frequent problem, and may be caused by clotted blood or precipitated drug within the catheter. Nursing care centers on prevention and intervention to remove the occlusion. Catheter-related infections may occur at one or more points along the catheter. The most serious are those occurring in the tunnel or as a result of a mural or catheter-tip thrombus. Normal skin flora are most commonly cultured with catheter-related infections. These organisms may be introduced into the body through the catheter hub or less often by migrating along the external catheter. Infections differ in their severity, prognosis, and treatment. Actions to minimize risk (scrupulous care and patient teaching), prompt recognition, and appropriate interventions are crucial. Thrombotic events include fibrin sheaths, patchy thrombotic plaques on the cannulated venous intima, and totally occlusive mural thromboses. Problems associated with these can range from withdrawal occlusion to obstruction of the great vessels and symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome. Mural thrombosis, which probably occurs more frequently than previously suspected, is the most significant risk factor for infection and may also potentiate extravasation. Prompt initiation of therapy will resolve symptoms and maintain the functioning of the catheter. Extravasation can result in transient discomfort or major tissue damage, pain, and functional loss. Needle dislodgment from ports is the most frequent cause. Adequate stabilization of needles and use of nonsiliconized needles are recommended to decrease this risk. Thrombosis at the catheter tip with back tracking of infusate out of the vein to subcutaneous tissues is the second most frequent cause of extravasation and has been reported with tunneled catheters as well as ports. It should be noted that catheter-tip displacement and catheter damage infrequently lead to extravasation. When extravasation is suspected, the infusion is stopped, and the nurse notifies the physician so diagnostic procedures and treatment can be initiated. Other complications occur infrequently but may contribute to patient discomfort, morbidity, and mortality. These include phlebitis, which resolves with conservative management in most instances, and pneumothorax, which occurs in a small percentage of patients within a short period after catheter placement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Included in the analysis were the location of the pulmonary infiltrates, the distribution and parenchymal patterns of disease, and the prevalence of adenopathy, pleural effusions, and/or cavity formation. Blastomycosis pneumonitis involved more than one pulmonary lobe in 21 patients and a single upper lobe in 27 of 63 patients. Forty-eight of the 63 patients had air-space consolidation. In nine of the 63 patients, a pulmonary mass was the major abnormality seen on radiographs. Approximately one fifth of the patients had associated pleural effusions and/or mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Twenty-three patients (37%) had cavitation within the area of pulmonary consolidation. These findings suggest that blastomycosis should be considered when chest radiographs show air-space infiltrate in the upper lobes or in more than one lobe of the lung, especially when the infiltrate is associated with pleural effusions, cavitation, lymphadenopathy, and/or a paramediastinal mass.\r"

  ".W": "Fluoroscopy and CT are widely used to guide percutaneous needle biopsy of thoracic lesions. However, some lesions are not sufficiently visible on fluoroscopy and others are dangerous to access on CT without real-time monitoring. When these are the circumstances, sonographic guidance may be helpful. Real-time sonography was used to guide percutaneous needle biopsy in 124 patients with thoracic lesions. The indications for sonographic guidance included pulmonary, pleural, or mediastinal lesions in contact with the chest wall, including lesions near the heart or great vessels (n = 12); lesions in the apical region (n = 5); lesions in a juxtadiaphragmatic location (n = 6); small lung nodules adjacent to the chest wall (n = 16); and peripheral tumors with adjacent pleural effusion (n = 4). A diagnosis was made in 74 (90%) of 82 malignant lesions and in 24 (67%) of 36 benign lesions. Complications included pneumothorax (n = 5), hemoptysis (n = 1), and hemothorax (n = 1). The advantages of sonographic guidance are that the sonographic equipment is mobile and real-time monitoring makes the procedure safer. Its limitations are that it cannot be used when aerated lung or free air (pneumothorax) lies between the chest wall and the lesion and that cavitary lesions are difficult to sample by biopsy. Our results show that the use of sonographic guidance considerably expands the number of thoracic lesions amenable to percutaneous biopsy.\r"

If only cases with representative cytologic yield are considered, the sensitivity was 93% and the specificity was 97%. The predictive values were high except for the predictive value of a negative cytologic finding in a spiculated lesion (50%). Sampling errors caused by abundant fibrosis, needle deviation, and difficulty in defining the lesion on the stereoscopic views are discussed. Another source of sampling error may be the mixed nature of some lesions consisting of benign and malignant components.

Identification of diverticula on sonograms was taken as evidence of acute diverticulitis. Fifty-four patients had sonographic findings consistent with this diagnosis. These included gut wall thickening (53), diverticula (34), pericolic (21) and intramural (two) fluid collections, edema of the pericolic fat (22), and intramural sinus tract (one). The final diagnosis was based on the clinical impression (all cases); pathologic interpretation of a surgical specimen (33 cases); findings on contrast enema (40 cases), CT scan (14 cases), and colonoscopy (18 cases); and a favorable clinical outcome in the absence of therapy (17 cases). Forty-six of the 54 patients with positive sonograms had acute diverticulitis, six had pericolic inflammatory masses caused by other colonic diseases, and two had surgically confirmed diverticulosis without active inflammation. All 17 patients with normal sonograms were treated conservatively. Diverticulitis was not confirmed in any of these patients. Our study suggests that sonography is a valuable imaging technique in the patient with signs and symptoms of acute diverticulitis.\r"

  ".W": "Hilar cholangiocarcinoma usually appears on CT scans as a low-density or isodense mass that abruptly obstructs converging dilated bile ducts. In four of six patients with histopathologically proved hilar cholangiocarcinoma who had late enhanced CT 8-15 min after dynamic CT, the lesion was seen as a high-density mass instead of the low-density lesion seen earlier on unenhanced and dynamic CT scans. The other two patients had ring enhancement with evidence of a thickened wall of the bile duct both on early and late enhanced CT scans. In the first four patients, carcinoma invaded the neighboring hepatic parenchyma and produced a mass, whereas in the last two, carcinoma was localized in the wall of the bile duct. Histopathologically, all lesions consisted of adenocarcinoma associated with a dense fibrotic tissue. As late enhanced CT shows hilar cholangiocarcinoma as a high-density mass, the exact location of the tumor and its relation to neighboring vessels can be determined, especially in relatively small tumors, and differentiation from sclerosing cholangitis is possible.\r"

  ".W": "The resistive index (RI), calculated from the duplex Doppler waveform, was compared with clinical and laboratory findings and the results of renal biopsy in 41 patients with nonobstructive (medical) renal disease. Kidneys with active disease in the tubulointerstitial compartment had a mean RI of 0.75 +/- 0.07. This was statistically significantly different (p less than .01) from the RI in kidneys with disease limited to the glomeruli (mean RI of 0.58 +/- 0.05). Acute tubular necrosis resulted in an elevated RI (mean RI = 0.78 +/- 0.03) as did vasculitis/vasculopathy (mean RI = 0.82 +/- 0.05). Patients with hypertension, proteinuria, or hematuria did not have kidneys with a significantly higher RI than did patients without these clinical factors. Kidneys found to be abnormally echogenic did not have an RI significantly different from kidneys of normal echogenicity. There was a weak correlation between creatinine level and RI value, reflected by a linear correlation coefficient of 0.34. In patients with normal renal RIs, the mean creatinine level was 1.7 +/- 1.7, whereas in those with abnormal RI values (greater than or equal to 0.70), the mean creatinine level was 3.7 +/- 3.6. We conclude that some forms of nonobstructive renal disease can produce changes in the Doppler waveform detectable by RI measurement. The production of Doppler waveform changes is strongly influenced by the site of the main disease within the kidneys. Active disease within the tubulointerstitial compartment (acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis) or vasculitis/vasculopathy generally resulted in an elevated RI, whereas disease limited to the glomeruli, no matter how severe, did not significantly elevate the RI. Degree of renal dysfunction as indicated by serum creatinine level probably affects the Doppler waveform to some degree, but the relationship is weak.\r"

High-field-strength MR imaging has been shown to elevate tissue temperatures, particularly if high levels of RF radiation are used. To determine if MR imaging above the recommended level for RF radiation is associated with heating of the scrotum, scrotal skin temperatures were measured in eight subjects immediately before and after MR imaging of the scrotum with a 1.5-T, 64-MHz MR scanner at mean whole-body average specific absorption rates ranging from 0.56 to 0.84 W/kg (mean, 0.72 W/kg). The average imaging time was 23 min. A statistically significant (p less than .01) increase in average scrotal skin temperature was associated with MR imaging (before MR imaging, 30.8 degrees C; after MR imaging, 32.3 degrees C). The largest change in temperature was 3.0 degrees C, and the highest temperature measured was 34.1 degrees C. MR imaging at relatively high specific absorption rates produced a statistically significant increase in average scrotal skin temperature. However, the recorded temperatures were below the threshold known to affect spermatogenesis in mammals.\r"

The specific question prompting our investigation was, does repetitive impulse loading produced by jogging cause acute structural changes within the knee that are visible by MR imaging? The knees of 10 healthy subjects were examined on a 1.5-T MR system before and immediately after 30 min of continuous jogging. The same extremity was examined each time, and the imaging sequences and photographic technique (meniscal windows) were identical for both examinations. Effusions developed in five of 10 subjects after exercise. In addition, five of 10 subjects had subtle increased signal intensity within their menisci. These results suggest that jogging frequently leads to acute changes in the knee that are visible on MR imaging. The significance of these changes is unknown.\r"

This pseudotear is due to the meniscal insertion of the meniscofemoral ligament. To study the normal appearance of the medial aspect of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus, we analyzed 109 MR examinations and correlated the findings with the results of arthroscopy. The meniscofemoral ligament was visualized in 54 cases (50%), and in 42 cases (39%) it caused the appearance of a pseudotear on sagittal images. The pseudotear had one of two orientations. The most common (35/42) was an oblique orientation coursing from the superior surface posteriorly and inferiorly. The other (7/42) was a more vertical orientation parallel to the base of the meniscus. Knowledge of the characteristic location and orientation of the meniscofemoral ligament should help to distinguish it from a true meniscal tear on MR images.\r"

This article describes the MR appearance of the normal and abnormal (positional and osseous changes) TMJ in the coronal plane and compares these findings with their cryosectional anatomy. Twenty-two TMJs from unselected frozen cadavers were embedded in paraffin. Coronal and sagittal MR imaging was performed; specimens were then cut in the same plane as the coronal images. Disk position by cryosection was normal in 14 cases and abnormal in eight cases. Coronal MR images alone correctly depicted the TMJ disk position in 17 cases (77%) (13 normal, four abnormal). Complementary sagittal images were necessary for diagnosing anterior displacement in two cases (9%). MR was inaccurate in three cases (14%) of severe degenerative joint disease. Bone condition was correctly diagnosed on the basis of coronal images alone in all cases. Our study shows that coronal MR imaging alone of the TMJ in cadavers accurately shows disk position in 77% of cases. Complementary sagittal images were of benefit in the diagnosis of an additional 9% with anterior displacement. Disk position was assessed inaccurately in either plane in patients with severe degenerative joint disease. For a full MR assessment of the TMJ for disk position and bone condition, we recommend imaging in both coronal and sagittal planes.\r"

Correlation of the imaging studies with the laparotomy findings showed that lymphography has a greater sensitivity (80%) than does CT (40%) in detecting retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The sensitivity of CT in detecting splenic involvement was only 19%, presumably because of the small size of tumor deposits in involved spleens. Staging laparotomy altered the clinical stage in 37% of children, which resulted in a significant change of therapy in those patients. Although lymphography and, to a lesser degree, CT are useful for staging of Hodgkin disease, laparotomy continues to be the most important tool in choosing appropriate therapy for children with Hodgkin disease.\r"

Two patients were imaged at 48 hr also, and one patient was imaged additionally with single-photon emission CT. Twenty-seven of the patients had surgery within 2-3 weeks. The serum CEA concentrations were normal in 27 of 29 patients. Immunoglobulin G human anti-murine-antibody concentrations were elevated in three of 20 patients. Ten patients had scintigraphic findings suggesting a malignant tumor, six of them had histologically proved malignant tumors. The tumors associated with positive immunoscintigrams were stained immunohistochemically with anti-CEA, and four of the malignant tumors were positive in immunohistochemical staining. The results suggest that nonspecific anti-CEA-antibody imaging is helpful in predicting the presence of a malignant tumor in the parotid area. The radioantibody method could provide useful clinical information that has a high negative predictive value.\r"

Although the clinical presentation of these patients was similar, we found distinctive MR abnormalities in characteristic locations in the seven patients with SNE, with or without detectable specific mitochondrial enzyme deficiency in cultured skin fibroblast assays. In our case studies of SNE patients with detectable enzyme deficiency states, defects in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and cytochrome c oxidase have been found. The MR finding of note in SNE is the remarkably symmetrical involvement, most frequently of the putamen. In our study, lesions were also commonly found in the globus pallidus and the caudate nucleus, but never in the absence of putaminal abnormalities. Other areas of involvement included the paraventricular white matter, corpus callosum, substantia nigra, decussation of superior cerebellar peduncles, periaqueductal region, and brainstem. In patients who present with lactic acidosis and whose MR findings show symmetrical abnormalities in the brain, but with sparing of the putamen, the diagnosis of SNE is in doubt.\r"

  ".U": "90247244\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of chemical-shift artifacts on cranial MR and to illustrate the interrelationship among chemical-shift artifacts, variable acquisition parameters, and field strength. Measurements of chemical-shift artifacts were performed on scans obtained from a volunteer imaged in a 1.5-T General Electric system at bandwidths of 8, 16, and 32 kHz, using a 24-cm field of view and an 8-kHz bandwidth with a 48-cm field of view. Chemical-shift displacements at 8 kHz were 6.6 and 14.2 mm at the respective fields of view. Retrospective review was also performed in 77 cases of cranial MR performed on a 1.4-T Technicare unit for the presence and source of chemical-shift artifact on spin-density and T2-weighted images. Most data reviewed showed no significant interference of chemical-shift artifacts on cranial images. An artifactual subdural fluid collection was a common artifact (n = 30/77). When present, this was due to shift of fat signal from subcutaneous tissues onto the brain in patients younger than 10 years old (n = 4/10) and correlated with the distance between brain and subcutaneous fat of less than the linear value of the chemical shift. When this artifact was present in adults (n = 25/67), it was due to shift of the medullary fat signal across the inner table of the skull. The latter also occurred in one child under 10. Apparent location shifts, consistent with the displacement expected from the chemical-shift artifact, were noted in five of five cases of intracranial lipoma. In one of these, the chemical-shift artifact disguised the presence of a large associated vessel. The method of calculating the linear displacement of chemical-shift artifact is reviewed, and the interrelationship of machine parameters and chemical-shift artifact is illustrated. Chemical-shift artifact increases proportionally with field strength and field of view. Increasing the bandwidth to decrease chemical-shift artifact has a resultant penalty in signal to noise but allows a lower time to echo. A lower time to echo can also be accomplished without increasing the bandwidth if asymmetric sampling is used. Awareness of the relationships among chemical-shift artifacts, acquisition parameters, and field strengths can result in a more tailored examination when the chemical-shift artifact is going to be a significant factor. In addition, interpreter error can be avoided by awareness of these relationships when reviewing images from outside institutions.\r"

Hyperintensities were analyzed with respect to size (on a scale of 0-3) and location: lesions were periventricular, subcortical, or cortical. The patients with memory disorder and dementia were categorized as having probable/possible Alzheimer disease, a combination of Alzheimer disease and multiinfarct cognitive disorder, or multiinfarct cognitive disorder alone on the basis of clinically determined Hachinski ischemic scores. Significant correlations were found between age and scores for periventricular lesions (r = .40, p less than .0005) and subcortical lesions (r = .39, p less than .0005) in normal subjects. Correlations were also found between the Hachinski ischemic score and scores for periventricular lesions (r = .21, p less than .01), subcortical lesions (r = .27, p less than .0002), and cortical lesions (r = .32, p less than .0005) in subjects with memory disorder/dementia. Comparing multiinfarct cognitive disorder, Alzheimer disease, and normal groups, the mean scores for periventricular lesions were 12.0 +/- 4.6, 7.6 +/- 4.8, and 3.4 +/- 2.6, while mean scores for subcortical lesions were 10.8 +/- 12.2, 4.1 +/- 6.4, and 0.8 +/- 1.2, respectively. Periventricular lesions were present in 99-100% of patients with Alzheimer disease and multiinfarct cognitive disorder. On the other hand, subcortical lesions, which were identified in 100% of patients with multiinfarct cognitive disorder, were present in only about half of the patients with Alzheimer disease. Thus, scores for both periventricular and subcortical lesions are positively correlated with age and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and also are significantly increased in the presence of objective memory disorder or dementia. These results imply that in the subject groups considered here, elderly patients with vascular dementia are most likely to have severe white-matter abnormalities on MR scans. The score for subcortical lesions appears to be more helpful than the score for periventricular lesions in distinguishing vascular dementia from Alzheimer disease and normal aging, so that a patient with prominent subcortical white-matter abnormalities is more likely to have a diagnosis of vascular than degenerative dementia.\r"

Infarcts, in well-defined arterial distributions, were diagnosed either uni- or bilaterally in the posterior cerebral (17), proximal and/or distal anterior cerebral (11), middle cerebral (11), lenticulostriate/thalamoperforating (nine), anterior choroidal (three), and/or vertebrobasilar (two) territories in 23 patients. Two other patients displayed atypical infarction patterns with sharply marginated cortical and subcortical low densities crossing typical vascular territories. CT findings suggested direct vascular compression due to mass effects from edema, contusion, and intra- or extraaxial hematoma as the cause of infarction in 24 patients; there was postmortem verification in five. In one patient, a skull-base fracture crossing the precavernous carotid canal led to occlusion of the internal carotid artery and ipsilateral cerebral infarction. Mortality in craniocerebral trauma with complicating posttraumatic cerebral infarction, 68% in this series, did not differ significantly from that in craniocerebral trauma patients without posttraumatic cerebral infarction when matched for admission Glasgow Coma Score results. Thus, aggressive management should be considered even in the presence of posttraumatic cerebral infarction.\r"

Retrospective evaluation of 299 patients treated in 1986 and 1987 for initial presentation or recurrence of testicular, retroperitoneal, and mediastinal germ cell tumors was performed to determine indications for neuroimaging, frequency and site of CNS metastases, and occurrence of other CNS abnormalities. Sixty-six patients required CNS imaging with myelography, CT, or MR. Studies were normal in 24 patients. Twenty patients had CNS metastases including 11 with intracranial metastases, eight with spine lesions, and one with both brain and spine involvement. Sixteen had cerebral or cerebellar atrophy of unclear origin and functional significance. Two patients had ventriculomegaly without symptoms of hydrocephalus. Four patients had questionable lesions that were never confirmed. None of the 25 asymptomatic patients with elevated serum tumor markers had brain metastases. Fifteen of 17 patients with focal neurologic deficits and three of six patients with seizures had CNS metastases. CNS imaging to detect germ cell tumor metastases is most useful in the presence of neurologic deficits or seizures but is not useful in patients with unexplained elevation of serum tumor markers in the absence of neurologic deficits.\r"

The net effect of this response is vasoconstriction, cardiac stimulation and regional flow redistribution that may have a favorable effect in some situations and a deleterious effect in others. The possible adverse effects of vasoconstriction were studied in a Veterans Administration Cooperative Study that evaluated a 48-hour infusion of sodium nitroprusside in the setting of acute MI. In the presence of mild, probably primarily diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, nitroprusside appeared to have an adverse effect on long-term survival. However, in the presence of more severe, probably predominantly systolic dysfunction, nitroprusside had a favorable effect on the prognosis. Therefore, the decision of whether to accept or inhibit neuroendocrine activation in acute MI probably depends on the severity of the disease and the timing of the therapeutic intervals.\r"

Although ddC appears to be active in combating viral infection, as judged by its ability to decrease human immunodeficiency virus-1 p24 antigen titers and increase the number of CD4+ lymphocytes, it is also capable of causing severe peripheral neuropathy in a dose-dependent manner. The studies discussed here indicate that low-dose ddC treatment regimens substantially reduce the toxic side effects of this drug, and yet retain the ability to affect p24 antigen and CD4+ lymphocyte levels. These studies also define the window of therapeutic usefulness for ddC, and suggest that both safety and activity can be maintained during long-term, low-dose use of ddC.\r"

  ".W": "The major cause of chronic post-transfusion hepatitis, the hepatitis C virus (HCV), has been identified. HCV is a single-stranded linear RNA virus with characteristics similar to the flaviviruses. A different agent, the hepatitis E virus, is associated with epidemic (enterically-transmitted) non-A, non-B hepatitis. At present, infection with HCV is recognized by the finding of anti-HCV antibodies, positive in up to 90% of patients with chronic non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis. Antibodies to HCV are detected in 1% of normal volunteer blood donors and in the majority of donors implicated in post-transfusion hepatitis. HCV antibodies are also found in patients with autoimmune liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, HCV infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of liver disease in alcoholic patients. The role of HCV infection in fulminant non-A, non-B hepatitis and hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia has not been elucidated as yet. Therapy of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis with recombinant human alpha-interferon has been shown to improve or normalize aminotransferase levels in approximately 50% of patients, most of whom have evidence of HCV infection. However, relapse after cessation of treatment is common. In the future, screening blood for evidence of HCV infection may prevent most cases of non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis.\r"

The MEE samples were classified into four groups: pediatric serous, mucoid, and acute, and adult serous. Endotoxin levels and lysosomal protease activity in MEEs were significantly different in the following order: adult less than serous less than mucoid less than acute groups, indicating that both endotoxin and lysosomal proteases are more closely related to the pathogenesis of pediatric chronic OME than to adult OME. In pediatric serous and mucoid effusions, endotoxin level had a significant correlation with activity of the lysosomal proteases. In conclusion, endotoxin enhances leukocyte infiltration into the middle ear, and lysosomal proteases released from leukocytes damage the middle ear mucosa and thereby prolong mucosal inflammation, which may be responsible for delayed recovery from acute OME.\r"

Eight infants were given either Addiphos or dipotassium hydrogen phosphate alternately for 48 hour periods and similar amounts of calcium and phosphorus were delivered. There were no significant differences in calcium and phosphorus intake, calcium and phosphate plasma concentrations, or acid-base state between study periods on the two solutions. Seventeen infants were given the two solutions alternately for 72 hour periods; Addiphos was used to increase the amounts of calcium and phosphorus being delivered. Calcium and phosphorus intake was decreased on dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, but Addiphos significantly increased calcium and phosphorus intake and plasma calcium and phosphate concentrations. It also lowered the pH of the urine and raised the titratable acidity. Acid-base state, however, was not significantly different. It is therefore possible to increase intake of calcium and phosphorus in preterm infants without causing a significant metabolic acidosis.\r"

Biopsies were taken on day 6 and histopathological examination of fixed paraffin-embedded sections from sites which had received 30 micrograms IFN-gamma revealed a moderate perivascular lymphohistiocytic dermal infiltrate with mast cells. Immunophenotyping of 5 microns cryostat sections demonstrated that 3 micrograms IFN-gamma induced keratinocyte HLA-DR expression in the absence of any significant infiltrate. More intense keratinocyte HLA-DR expression was produced by 30 micrograms IFN-gamma in all specimens, with HLA-DP concurrently expressed in three biopsies. The ratio of CD4:CD8 cells within the infiltrate was approximately 3:1. CD1 + cells within the epidermis were markedly depleted by 30 micrograms IFN-gamma, while CD1-labelled cells were observed in the dermal perivascular infiltrate. Intradermal IFN-gamma induces similar immunopathological changes to those observed in many of the inflammatory dermatoses.\r"

Using membrane-permeable diacylglycerol, I-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), and calcium ionophore, A-23187, the effects of these chemicals on the epidermal adenylate cyclase system were investigated. OAG increased forskolin- and cholera toxin-induced cyclic AMP accumulations, but receptor adenylate cyclase responses were markedly decreased by treatment with OAG. The effects of OAG were inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7. Calcium ionophore, A-23187, had no effect on the epidermal adenylate cyclase responses. Combinations of OAG and A-23187 (as well as the calcium chelator, EGTA), showed that the action of OAG was mostly unaffected by the modulation of intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The results suggest that among the signals triggered by the breakdown of inositol phospholipids, only diacylglycerol-protein kinase C signal is involved in the regulation of the epidermal adenylate cyclase system.\r"

Here we have tested LIF/DIA for possible effects on the growth and differentiation of normal human hematopoietic cells in culture. As a single agent, LIF/DIA had no effect on colony formation by CD34-positive human bone marrow cells. However, LIF/DIA was as effective as either interleukin-6 (IL-6) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the enhancement of IL-3-dependent colony formation of very primitive blast colony-forming cells. Studies using neutralizing antibodies against IL-6 or G-CSF demonstrated that this was not due to induction in culture of either of the other known synergistic factors for blast cell colony formation. A 1-day delay in the time course of appearance of blast cell colonies grown in the presence of LIF/DIA relative to those grown in the presence of IL-6 suggests that the different synergistic factors may operate through different mechanisms, although we cannot rule out that high doses of LIF/DIA might yield accelerated blast cell colony formation. Our findings provide evidence that LIF/DIA may play an important role, along with IL-6 and G-CSF, in the regulation of early hematopoietic stem cells.\r"

  ".U": "90248567\r", 
  ".W": "Molecular cloning has revealed that erythroid potentiating activity (EPA) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) represent two distinct activities of a single protein. We have studied the expression of the EPA/TIMP gene at the mRNA and protein levels during 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced megakaryoblastic differentiation of K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Northern hybridization analysis showed that the EPA/TIMP mRNA was increased within 3 hours of TPA-induction and reached maximal levels (about 50-fold induction) during the first day of treatment. The expression of mRNAs for two major metalloproteinases, collagenase-I and stromelysin, were activated in parallel in the differentiation-induced K562 cells. The increase of EPA/TIMP mRNA correlated with increased EPA/TIMP protein biosynthesis and secretion: the TPA-induced cells secreted substantially enhanced amounts of metabolically labeled proteins, of which EPA/TIMP represented up to 50% after the first day of treatment (over 100-fold induction). The induction of EPA/TIMP mRNA was associated with its increased transcription. EPA/TIMP induction required continuous protein synthesis, being completely inhibited by addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide simultaneously with TPA, but only partially inhibited in a time-dependent manner if cycloheximide was added after TPA. Unlike in other cells tested, the jun and c-fos transcription factor mRNAs showed a prolonged biphasic induction response in K562 cells during TPA treatment. This response was associated with enhanced activity of a transfected recombinant reporter plasmid containing binding sites for the jun/fos transcription factor complex (AP-1) similar to the TPA-responsive element (TRE) sequence we found in the EPA/TIMP gene promoter. We suggest that the induction of EPA/TIMP and several other genes specific for the differentiating K562 cells may be a consequence of the sustained activation of immediate early genes encoding transcription factors, such as jun and c-fos.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cells play an important role in the regulation of fibrinolysis by the production of several key regulatory proteins. The cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin, and interleukin-1 (IL-1), but not interleukin-6, increase the production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by endothelial cells, whereas they have no stimulatory effect on the production of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Primary cultures of human endothelial cells release very little urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). We report here that TNF and lymphotoxin induce, in a concentration-dependent way, the production of both cellular and secreted u-PA antigen in primary and subcultured human endothelial cells. The TNF-induced increase was accompanied by a more than 10-fold increase in u-PA mRNA. Upon stimulation of early passage umbilical vein endothelial cells by TNF, u-PA was predominantly secreted at the basolateral side, whereas PAI activity and t-PA were found in more equal amounts at the apical and basolateral sides of the cell monolayers. TNF-stimulated u-PA secretion by subcultured human aorta endothelial cells showed only a marginal polarity. The u-PA antigen was present in a plasmin-activatable form (single chain u-PA) and in a nonactivatable form (probably u-PA: PAI-1 complex). During the induction of u-PA by TNF, the ratio between plasmin-activatable u-PA and total u-PA decreased markedly. This may indicate that TNF also increases the degree of u-PA activation. The parallel induction of the synthesis and secretion of both u-PA and PAI-1 by endothelial cells adds a new aspect to the alterations of the fibrinolytic system caused by inflammatory mediators. This aspect may be significant for the regulation of cell-associated and interstitial plasminogen activator activity.\r"

Factor Xa formation is also dependent on the presence of negatively charged phospholipid. A phospholipid binding domain of FVIII has been reported to be present on the FVIII light chain. Recent observations on a subset of human FVIII inhibitors have implicated the carboxyl-terminal C2 domain of FVIII as containing a possible phospholipid binding site. The purpose of this study was to investigate directly the role of the C2 domain in phospholipid binding. Twenty-six overlapping peptides, which span the entire C2 domain of FVIII, were synthesized. The ability of these peptides to inhibit the binding of purified human FVIII to immobilized phosphatidylserine was evaluated in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Three overlapping synthetic FVIII peptides, 2303-2317, 2305-2332, and 2308-2322, inhibited FVIII binding to phosphatidylserine by greater than 90% when tested at a concentration of 100 mumols/L. A fourth partially overlapping peptide, 2318-2332, inhibited FVIII binding by 65%. These results suggest that the area described by these peptides, residues 2303 to 2332, may play an important role in the mediation of FVIII binding to phospholipid.\r"

These CD4+, CD8+ cells may be immature precursors that function to replenish functional T-cell subsets. We detected a very high level of CD4+, CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a healthy white male, ranging from 21% to 36%. The morphology of his peripheral blood lymphocytes was normal, and he has maintained an elevated level of CD4+, CD8+ cells without clinical disease over a 19-month observation period. The CD4+, CD8+ cells did not possess thymocyte membrane antigen (CD6), nor did they have increased Tac (CD25) antigen. His intact, purified blood T cells had a normal proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 (IL-2), provided help for B-cell proliferation at control levels and exposure to IL-2 resulted in generation of cytotoxic cells. However, the purified blood CD4+, CD8+ cells were deficient in these latter functions except for help in B-cell function. Despite defective function, the isolated CD4+, CD8+ cells co-expressed CD2 and CD3. Prolonged in vitro culture of CD4+, CD8+ cells was possible in the presence of recombinant IL-2. The cultured CD4+, CD8+ cells retained the double antigens (CD4 and CD8) throughout a 4-week period. It is likely these cells are less mature than CD4+, CD8- or CD4-, CD8+ T cells as the CD4+, CD8+ have less in vitro function than the former cells, but it is not yet clear if they mature into either CD4+, CD8-, or CD4-, CD8+ cells. Finally, the presence of an expanded, hypofunctioning CD4+, CD8+ cell population in a normal adult male is apparently compatible with excellent clinical health.\r"

  ".U": "90248577\r", 
  ".W": "The recent demonstration of the ability of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to secrete various cytokines in response to the granulocyte activator granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but not to other cytokines, has led to the identification of PMN as biosynthetically active cells. In this study we have investigated the ability of PMN to secrete interleukin-6 (IL-6), a molecule known to be involved in inflammatory reactions. Using RNA blotting analysis and bioassays, we show that PMN could be induced to synthesize transcripts specific for IL-6, indistinguishable in size from IL-6 mRNA produced by activated human macrophages. Consequently, PMN released IL-6-like activity into their culture supernatants that could be neutralized by monospecific anti-IL-6 antibody. Interleukin-6 secretion by PMN, however, required previous stimulation with GM-CSF or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), whereas other cytokines, including interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF), macrophage-CSF (M-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and lymphotoxin (LT), failed to induce IL-6 mRNA accumulation and protein secretion by PMN. Similar to GM-CSF and TNF-alpha, other compounds, including the inhibitor of protein synthesis cyclohexemide (CHX), endotoxin (Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide), and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (but not the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [FMLP]), induced detectable levels of IL-6 transcripts in PMN.\r"

Pain relief was obtained in 6 patients. Two patients who reported complete relief of pain showed suppressed levels of gonadotrophins after MPA treatment. In the other patients, suppression of plasma gonadotrophin levels was observed before treatment. The plasma levels of prolactin, growth hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone were not affected by MPA. Only 1 patient showed suppression of plasma adrenocortical trophic hormone. The plasma levels of cortisol and dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate were suppressed in 6 patients, but there was no correlation between the suppression and the occurrence of pain relief. These findings suggest that the mechanism of pain relief by high-dose MPA may be very complicated.\r"

Oestrogens--especially oral oestrogens--are potent inducers of liver synthesised proteins, including coagulation factors. We have assessed the effect of non-oral oestrogen on the coagulation system in patients with prostatic carcinoma. Twelve patients were given monthly intramuscular injections of 320 mg polyoestradiol phosphate (PEP). No additional oestrogens were given. No change was found in any of the coagulation factors, including factor VII, with the exception of a significant decrease in antithrombin III. No patient, including 38 patients treated with PEP, had any cardiovascular complications after a mean follow-up period of 12.9 +/- 0.7 months; 76% of the patients responded to treatment. Parenteral administration of oestrogen caused a less marked change in the coagulation system than oral administration and should be the treatment of choice for prostatic carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The Ontario Medical Association (OMA) guidelines for intravenous thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction were released in March 1988 and contributed to a government decision against special per-case funding to assist hospitals using tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). In October 1988, 1512 cardiologists, internists and physician-administrators who were OMA members were mailed a questionnaire seeking their views on the OMA guidelines and related issues. Of the 419 questionnaires (28%) that were returned, 392 contained usable responses. Among the respondents 268 (68%) had used thrombolytic drugs in the preceding 12 months; the mean number of cases was 10.6 (standard deviation 12.9). A strong or a mild preference for tPA over streptokinase was registered by 64% of the respondents; 28% had no preference. However, the self-reported ratio of actual streptokinase:tPA use was about 3:1, and 73% indicated that the government's funding policy had limited the availability of tPA in their hospital. The respondents were almost equally divided as to whether the policy should be changed. The guidelines were deemed helpful by 85% of the noncardiologists, as opposed to 52% of the cardiologists (p less than 0.005). OMA involvement in developing and circulating such guidelines was supported by 74% of the respondents and opposed by 18%; opposition was more likely to come from those who found the guidelines unhelpful (p less than 0.001). Support for involvement by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario was much weaker (supported by 32%, opposed by 62%). Overwhelming opposition to government involvement was evident.\r"

There were 31 women with poor prognosis advanced breast cancer in the study. Forty-five percent were younger than 40 years old, 68% had visceral dominant disease, 59% had more than two disease sites, and each of the five women tested had increased expression of primary tumor epidermal growth factor receptor. The objective response rate was 71% with manageable toxicity (95% confidence interval, 54% to 85%). The response rate in 22 patients not given prior chemotherapy was 72% and in 9 patients with cancers resistant to previous mitoxantrone monotherapy it was 67%. The high antitumor activity of this combination suggests further exploration of its use in breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Patients may fail to absorb cobalamin (vitamin B12) bound to food even when they have adequate intrinsic factor to absorb free cobalamin normally. We studied cobalamin transfer from egg yolk cobalamin-binding protein to human saliva and gastric juice as a model of this important first step in cobalamin assimilation. The cobalamin-binding protein of egg yolk eluted with human R binder on Sephadex gel chromatography and bound cobalamin with a comparable affinity, but it did not cross-react with R binder immunologically. Transfer of cobalamin from egg yolk to saliva or gastric juice R binder did not occur at neutral pH. Slight transfer (8%-12% of the 57Co-cobalamin bound to egg yolk) occurred when the saliva was acidified to pH 1.5. This minor transfer by acid was not inhibited by pepstatin A, a pepsin inhibitor. Acidification caused variable transfer to gastric juice R binder (12%-40%) that appeared to be partially due to residual gastric pepsin activity. Adding 1200 U of pepsin per milliliter enhanced cobalamin transfer to saliva or gastric juice R binders (39%-58% transfer). At no time was cobalamin transferred directly to intrinsic factor; R binder-deficient gastric juice failed to accept cobalamin from egg yolk. The transfer of cobalamin from egg yolk to human R binder requires both an acid pH and pepsin activity. While as little as 30 U of pepsin added per milliliter of saliva promoted transfer of cobalamin, the requirement for an acid pH was very strict. Virtually no transfer occurred when pH exceeded 2.0, regardless of the amount of pepsin present. Acid provided an optimal pH for pepsin activity and, to a lesser extent, affected transfer by a mechanism unrelated to pepsin. Our data suggest that compromised pepsin secretion and, probably even more importantly, compromised acid secretion interfere with transfer of food cobalamin to R binder.\r"

  ".U": "90249639\r", 
  ".W": "In animals, the distribution of the enzyme diamine oxidase is confined, almost exclusively, to the small bowel mucosa. In humans, plasma diamine oxidase is at or below assay detection limits but can be liberated into the circulation from binding sites in the intestine by i.v. heparin. Therefore, the authors wished to see if diamine oxidase could be released by a low and safe dose of heparin (5000 U) and if the resultant area under the concentration-time curve would provide a noninvasive marker of segmental intestinal disease. In 17 control subjects, the mean area under the curve (following administration of 5000 U i.v. heparin) was 35.9 +/- 5.0 (SEM) mU.L-1.2 h-1; in 6 individuals studied on two separate occasions, postheparin plasma diamine oxidase profiles were reproducible (r = 0.98; p less than 0.001). The longitudinal distribution of diamine oxidase in the gastrointestinal tract, measured in 12 gastric, 16 jejunal, 6 ileal, and 18 colonic biopsies, was similar in humans to that found in animals. In patients with normal peroral biopsies, there was a linear relationship between jejunal mucosal and postheparin plasma diamine oxidase activities (r = 0.84; p less than 0.01). The areas under the curve in controls were then compared with those in patients with segmental intestinal diseases: 21 with ileal disease with or without colonic Crohn's disease (10 unoperated and 11 with ileal resection), 7 with non-Crohn's ileal resection, 8 with ulcerative colitis, 10 with untreated and 7 with treated celiac disease (6 studied before and after a gluten-free diet), and 5 studied during total parenteral nutrition and again after resumption of oral feeding. The results in the 18 ileectomized patients were subdivided into those with major (arbitrarily greater than 75 cm) and minor (less than 75 cm) resections. Areas under the curve were markedly reduced in nonresected Crohn's patients (6.0 +/- 1.79 mU.L-1.2 h-1; p less than 0.001 vs. controls), correlating inversely, in a first-order relationship, with disease activity (r = 0.82; p less than 0.001) and returning toward normal in 4 patients achieving disease remission. Low areas under the curve in total parenteral nutrition patients (4.5 +/- 0.9; p less than 0.001) were also reversible on resumption of oral feeding. However, areas under the curve were not significantly lower in patients with limited ileal resection (less than or equal to 75 cm), with celiac disease (untreated and treated), or ulcerative colitis than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Although hepatic architecture in the stillborn fetus was markedly disordered, with hepatocyte giant cell transformation, extrahepatic siderosis was not present and hepatic siderosis was minimal. These findings indicate that in some cases of neonatal hemochromatosis, extrahepatic siderosis may be caused by hepatic injury rather than primarily due to excessive transport of iron from mother to fetus and support speculation that in some instances an infective agent may be responsible.\r"

The most common histopathological finding in colonic biopsies of these patients was Schistosoma mansoni ova in the colonic mucosa with no or mild inflammatory cells infiltrates. These findings correlate with the endoscopic appearances in most patients. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain or distention in 84 patients (38.88%). Sixty five patients (30.09%) had hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Eight patients had schistosomal polyps and two patients had colonic malignancy in which no association between their malignancy and Schistosoma mansoni infection was established. After antischistosomal treatment follow up, sigmoidoscopy was normal in 28 patients who previously had abnormal endoscopic appearances. Colonoscopic examination is valuable in colonic schistosomiasis as it can show characteristic colonic lesions and colonic biopsies are diagnostic and correlates with histological findings.\r"

Patients were enrolled in the study in groups of four or five; the initial group received an IFN-gamma dose of 0.03 mg/m2 and subsequent groups received higher IFN-gamma doses of 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/m2. Toxicity resulting from IFN-gamma was minimal and the therapy was well tolerated even at the maximum dose (3 mg/m2). No patients developed antibodies that neutralized IFN-gamma. Clinical responses were observed in 3 of 17 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). A complete clinical response was achieved in one individual and a partial, temporary regression of KS lesions was observed in two other patients. HIV p24 antigen was decreased in plasma samples obtained from six of nine patients with initially detectable HIV protein.

This compound is also a potent inhibitor of primate renins [IC50 (in nM): human, 0.3; and marmoset, 1.4]. It is less potent against other aspartic proteinases [IC50 (in nM): porcine pepsin, 26; and bovine cathepsin D, 230). CGP 44 099 A exhibited a competitive mode of inhibition against human renin (Ki, 0.12 nM). During i.v. infusion of CGP 44 099 A in sodium-depleted normotensive rats (0.1 mg/kg/min) blood pressure (BP) was lowered by about 25 mm Hg. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin I and angiotensin II were almost completely suppressed. The converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (1 mg/kg i.v.) also lowered BP by about 25 mm Hg. No further fall in BP occurred when CGP 44 099 A (0.1 mg/kg/min) was infused after pretreatment with enalaprilat (1 mg/kg i.v.) and CGP 44 099 A did not lower BP when infused in bilaterally nephrectomized rats. These results indicate that the hypotensive response induced by CGP 44 099 A in sodium-depleted rats is specifically due to the renin inhibition. Compounds such as CGP 44 099 may therefore be useful for comparing the effects of renin inhibition in different species and for studying the role of renin in various models of cardiovascular disease in nonprimate species.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) on diabetes-induced cardiac autonomic nerves disturbance, we examined the effects of ONO-2235, an ARI, as well as insulin on the responsiveness to the nerve stimulation and agonists of the isolated atria of the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Insulin, 4 U/animal/day, was administered s.c. for 4 weeks before the experiment and ARI (ONO-2235), 40 mg/kg/day, was administered p.o. 3 weeks before the experiment. The transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) of sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerve was performed in the presence of atropine and metoprolol plus prazocin, respectively. The positive chronotropic and the inotropic responses of the atria to sympathetic TNS and to norepinephrine decreased in the rats diabetic for 8 and 12 weeks. In the rats diabetic for 8 weeks, the insulin treatment restored completely both the positive chronotropic and the inotropic responses to sympathetic TNS, whereas the ARI treatment partially improved the positive chronotropic response and did not improve the positive inotropic response. In the rats diabetic for 12 weeks, the insulin treatment partially improved the positive chronotropic and the inotropic responses to sympathetic TNS, whereas the ARI treatment only slightly improved the positive chronotropic response and did not improve the positive inotropic response to TNS. The combination treatment with insulin and ARI restored completely both the positive chronotropic and the inotropic responses in the rats diabetic for 12 weeks. In rats diabetic for both 8 and 12 weeks, the decreased positive chronotropic and the inotropic responses to norepinephrine recovered completely with the insulin treatment, but did not with the ARI treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cromakalim and pinacidil produced the relaxation in 20.9 mM K(+)-contracted strips with a pD2 of 6.53 and 5.95, respectively. In 65.9 mM K(+)-contracted strips, high concentrations of pinacidil, but not cromakalim, produced relaxation. Ca+(+)-induced contractions in 80 mM K(+)-depolarized strips were also inhibited by pinacidil but not by cromakalim. Glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-regulated K+ (KATP) channels, competitively antagonized the relaxant responses to cromakalim with a pA2 value of 7.62. However, the antagonism by glibenclamide of the relaxant responses to pinacidil was not a typical competitive type, suggesting the contribution of other effects than the KATP channel opening activity to the relaxant effects of pinacidil. In resting strips preloaded with 86Rb, cromakalim and pinacidil increased the basal 86Rb efflux in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in the 86Rb efflux induced by cromakalim was greater than that by pinacidil. When the effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on the 86Rb efflux were determined in the 20.9 or 65.9 mM K(+)-contracted strips, both drugs increased the 86Rb efflux. Under the same conditions nifedipine, a Ca(+)+ channel blocker, produced the relaxation that is accompanied by the decrease in 86Rb efflux. The increase in the 86Rb efflux induced by cromakalim was much greater than that by pinacidil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The vasodilating action of nitroglycerin (NTG) is thought to be mediated by its metabolic activation to nitric oxide (NO) in the vascular smooth muscle cell, but the site at which this process occurs has not been defined. To determine which cellular component is primarily responsible for this metabolic activation, subcellular fractions of bovine vascular smooth muscle cells were prepared and incubated with NTG along with cofactors. Time-dependent headspace NO concentrations generated in these preparations were determined directly by chemiluminescence detection. A mathematical model was developed to relate headspace NO with the NO-generating activity in each incubation, correcting for the concurrent processes of NO partitioning between the headspace and the incubation medium, and NO degradation in these two phases. The estimated NO-generating activities from different subcellular fractions were well correlated with the activities of two enzyme markers of the plasma membrane (K(+)-activated ouabain sensitive p-nitrophenyl phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase), but not with those of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum or the cytosol. These results indicate that the enzyme(s) responsible for the metabolic activation of NTG, and possibly other organic nitrate vasodilators, are associated with the plasma membrane in bovine coronary smooth muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ouabain on the uptake of tritiated [3H]GABA and on its release in the absence of Ca(+)+ was studied in brain cortex synaptosomes. Ouabain, in the absence of Ca(+)+ and K(+)-depolarization, induces the release of [3H]GABA with half-maximal effect occurring at a concentration of about 7 X 10(-6) M. Parallel measurements of the effects of ouabain on the [3H]GABA uptake and the Na+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase activity show that ouabain inhibits both mechanisms and that the half-maximal effect also occurs at about the same ouabain concentration. Although [3H]GABA release is stimulated by ouabain, it appears that the inhibition of [3H]GABA uptake is due to a direct effect on the uptake mechanism, inasmuch as the initial velocity of the process is inhibited by ouabain. Ouabain requires extracellular Na+ for [3H]GABA release and for membrane depolarization and, in the absence of Na+, ouabain does not cause either [3H]GABA release or membrane depolarization. No significant changes in the Na+ gradients occur under conditions which permit release of [3H]GABA, but the Na+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase activity is inhibited, which may be responsible for membrane depolarization, which in turn may cause [3H]GABA release or inhibit its uptake.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ouabain on the rabbit ear artery response to serotonin was assessed in isolated vascular rings mounted in tissue baths for the measurement of isometric contractions and denervated with 6-hydroxydopamine in vitro. Ouabain, 1 and 10 microM, caused 5- and 6-fold shifts to the left of the serotonin concentration-response curve (CRC). However, 10 microM ouabain caused only a 1.6-fold shift to the left of the norepinephrine CRC. In the absence of ouabain, 0.01 microM ketanserin had little effect, whereas 0.1 microM prazosin caused a marked shift to the right of the serotonin CRC. In the presence of ouabain, prazosin exhibited little or no antagonism below 3 microM serotonin. Antagonism by ketanserin was increased by 1 and 10 microM ouabain, yielding 6.5- and 10.5-fold shifts to the right of the serotonin CRC, respectively. Benextramine pretreatment to inactivate alpha adrenoceptors nearly abolished the rabbit ear artery response to serotonin. However, in the presence of 10 microM ouabain, there was a substantial recovery of the response to serotonin, and this response was antagonized by ketanserin. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that serotonergic receptors are present in the smooth muscle cell membranes of the rabbit ear artery but are either uncoupled to the contractile mechanism or in a low efficacy state. In the presence of ouabain, these receptors either become coupled or convert to a high efficacy state and thereby contribute to the serotonin-induced contraction. Because the serotonin CRC was shifted to the left in the presence of ouabain, it is likely that most of the CRC was below the threshold concentration at which serotonin activates alpha adrenoceptors. Thus antagonism by prazosin was lost.\r"

Pretreatment in vivo with a hypnotic dose of ethanol (but not a subhypnotic dose), or exposure to a corresponding concentration in vitro, was effective. This increase in sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-operated chloride channels to the actions of DMCM was due to an increase in both the potency and efficacy of DMCM. Sensitization to DMCM was reversible and was not observed 24 hr after a single injection of ethanol. Pretreatment with ethanol (10, 50 and 100 mM) in vitro produced sensitization to DMCM in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to that produced by in vivo exposure; this increase in sensitivity did not develop if the membranes were pretreated with ethanol at 0 degrees C. Similarly, in vitro exposure to pentobarbital (200 microM) or flunitrazepam (1 microM) enhanced the actions of the inverse agonist Ro15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a][1,4]BZ-3- carboxylate). Acute ethanol exposure did not alter low-affinity gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor binding or muscimol action, or the ability of a BZ agonist, flunitrazepam, to augment muscimol-activated chloride flux. Ethanol exposure did not alter [3H]flumazenil (Ro15-1788) binding to central BZ receptors, its displacement by DMCM or allosteric modulation of DMCM binding by muscimol (muscimol-shift).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The three agents inhibited selectively relaxation induced by VIP and its homolog, peptide histidine isoleucine. Inhibition of VIP-induced relaxation in tenia coli and gastric fundic strips was consistent with competitive antagonism. Relaxation induced by field stimulation (80 V; 1 msec; 0.1-16 Hz) which is accompanied by a stoichiometric increase in VIP release was inhibited by the three antagonists in the following order of potency: VIP10-28 greater than VIP analog greater than GRF analog. The descending relaxation component of the peristaltic reflex induced by graded stretch of the orad end of a rat colonic segment which is also accompanied by an increase in VIP release, was inhibited by the three VIP antagonists in the same order of potency: VIP10-28 greater than VIP analog greater than GRF analog. The most potent antagonist, VIP10-28, abolished descending relaxation at the lowest grades of stretch (2 and 4 g) and inhibited relaxation at the highest grades of stretch (10 g) by 79%. The results indicate that VIP (and peptide histidine isoleucine) is the transmitter responsible for neurally induced gastric and intestinal relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of the K+ channel blocking agent, glyburide, on the actions of two K+ channel openers, BRL 34915 (cromakalim) and P 1060 (Leo), a potent pinacidil derivative (N-(t-butyl)-N\"-cyano-N'-3-pyridyl-guanidine), were ascertained. Tension responses and 86Rb fluxes in rat portal vein strips and single channel electrophysiological recordings in enzymatically dissociated rat portal vein cells were obtained. Glyburide (0.3 microM) increased spontaneous contractile activity and caused concentration-dependent shifts in the relaxation responses to BRL 34915 and P 1060. Increases in 86Rb efflux were obtained only at much higher concentrations of BRL 34915 or P 1060, and these increases were blocked only at higher concentrations of glyburide (5.0 microM). BRL 34915 and P 1060 specifically increase the open-state probability of the Ca+(+)-activated K+ (maxi-K+) channel, and these actions are blocked by glyburide and also by charybdotoxin. Changes in single channel activity and contractile responsiveness occur at similar concentrations of agonists and antagonists. Thus, the membrane channel in rat portal vein affected by glyburide, BRL 34915 and P 1060 appears to be the Ca+(+)-activated maxi-K+ channel (that does not show ATP dependence under the conditions of these experiments). Concentrations of agonists and antagonists effective on maxi-K+ channel activity correspond to those affecting contractile responsiveness and are lower than those eliciting changes in 86Rb flux.\r"

  ".U": "90250670\r", 
  ".W": "In this study, we have examined the spontaneous efflux and stimulation-induced overflow of endogenous dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) from striatal slices prepared from adult rats. Partial destruction of striatal DA terminals with 6-hydroxydopamine reduced the electrically evoked overflow of DA and DOPAC, but by less than the DA content of the tissue slices. This resulted in an increase in the fractional overflow of DA and DOPAC, a measure of overflow from residual dopaminergic terminals. The increase in fractional DA overflow was related to the lesion size, reaching 7-fold with DA depletions of greater than 90%. Inhibition of DA re-uptake with nomifensine (10 microM) increased DA overflow and reduced DOPAC overflow by an equivalent amount, indicating that a portion of the DA released by electrical stimulation is recaptured and metabolized before appearing as DOPAC in the superfusate. However, 6-hydroxydopamine lesions further elevated fractional DA overflow above control even in the presence of nomifensine, suggesting that slices prepared from lesioned animals exhibit an increase in DA release from residual dopaminergic terminals. DA overflow was enhanced by the DA receptor antagonist sulpiride (1 microM) in control tissue but not in slices prepared from lesioned animals, suggesting that increased efflux per terminal was accompanied by reduced autoinhibition of release. Over a range of firing frequencies typical of nigrostriatal neurons in vivo (2-8 Hz), fractional DA overflow per pulse from lesioned slices was 3-fold higher than control overflow; however, fractional overflow per pulse was reduced from lesioned but not control slices when slices were exposed to a higher frequency (12 Hz). Thus, the lesion appeared to have increased DA release at moderate frequencies, but had reduced the effective range of frequencies over which the DA terminals could operate. Finally, 3-iodotyrosine (2 mM), an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, reduced DA overflow from intact slices, but completely abolished overflow from lesioned slices, suggesting that 6-hydroxydopamine had increased the dependence of DA efflux on a sustained rate of DA synthesis. Taken together, these data suggest that after lesioning with 6-hydroxydopamine, DA released per pulse from residual terminals is increased relative to control, so long as the stimulation frequency is within the physiological range. This increase in release may serve a compensatory function, maintaining dopaminergic control over striatal function despite extensive loss of DA neurons.\r"

To examine if, before these public data releases, quality influenced the attractiveness of a hospital to referring or admitting physicians and to patients, we estimated the influences of quality, charges, ownership, and distance on the choice of hospitals for patients with seven surgical procedures and five medical diagnoses in hospitals in three geographic areas in California in 1983. Greater distance and public or proprietary ownership consistently reduced the likelihood of selection while medical school affiliation increased the likelihood of selection. For five of seven surgical procedures and two of five medical diagnoses, hospitals with poorer than expected outcomes attracted significantly fewer admissions. The reverse held for two surgical procedures and one medical diagnosis. The results suggest that quality played an important role in choices among hospitals even before explicit data were widely available.\r"

The concept of \"cost per quality-adjusted life year\" as a guideline for resource allocation is founded on six ethical assumptions: quality of life can be accurately measured and used, utilitarianism is acceptable, equity and efficiency are compatible, projections of community preferences can substitute for individual preferences, the old have less \"capacity to benefit\" than the young, and physicians will not use quality-adjusted life-years as clinical maxims. Quality-adjusted life-years signal two shifts in the locus of control and the nature of the clinical encounter: first, formal expressions of community preferences and societal usefulness would counterbalance patient autonomy, and second, formal tools of resource allocation and applied decision analysis would counterbalance the use of clinical judgment. These shifts reflect and reinforce a new financial ethos in medical decision making. Presently using quality-adjusted life-years for health policy decisions is problematic and speculative; using quality-adjusted life-years at the bedside is dangerous.\r"

However, treatment with alteplase made no difference to subsequent cardiac events after one month (readmissions, reinfarctions, death) nor to treatment for angina or heart failure. Product limit estimates of one year mortality are 13.2% with alteplase and 15.1% with placebo.

As new modalities of therapy for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy may soon be available for clinical use, it is hoped that the use of prospective therapeutic agents initially will be scrutinized through experimental trials adequate to determine their efficacy in the clinical setting. Only through the conduct of such trials will physicians avoid the pitfalls of routinely treating newborn infants with inappropriate drugs, as has occasionally occurred in the past.\r"

  ".W": "A radioactive and photoactivatable derivative of NAD+, 2-azido-[adenylate-32P]NAD+, has been synthesized and used with pertussis toxin to ADP-ribosylate Cys347 of the alpha subunit (alpha T) of GT, the retinal guanine nucleotide-binding protein. ADP-ribosylation of alpha T followed by light activation of the azide moiety of 2-azido-[adenylate-32P]ADP-ribose produced four crosslinked species involving the alpha and gamma subunits of the GT heterotrimer: an alpha trimer (alpha-alpha-alpha), and alpha-alpha-gamma crosslink, an alpha dimer (alpha-alpha), and an alpha-gamma crosslink. The alpha trimer, alpha-alpha-gamma complex, alpha dimer, and alpha-gamma complexes were immunoreactive with alpha T antibodies. The alpha-alpha-gamma and the alpha-gamma complexes were immunoreactive with antisera recognizing gamma subunits. No evidence was found for crosslinking of alpha T to beta T subunits. Hydrolysis of the thioglycosidic bond between Cys347 and 2-azido-[adenylate-32P]ADP-ribose using mercuric acetate resulted in the transfer of radiolabel from Cys347 of alpha T in the crosslinked oligomers to alpha monomers, indicative of intermolecular photocrosslinking, and to gamma monomers, indicative of either intermolecular crosslinked complexes (between heterotrimers) or intramolecular crosslinked complexes (within the heterotrimer). These results demonstrate that GT exists as an oligomer and that ADP-ribosylated Cys347, which is four residues from the alpha T-carboxyl terminus, is oriented toward and in close proximity to the gamma subunit.\r"

  ".U": "90251619\r", 
  ".W": "Molecular dynamics has been used to study binding of substrate CO2 to the active site of human carbonic anhydrase II. Three potential CO2 binding sites have been located. The first is at the active-site hydrophobic pocket (the catalytically productive site), where CO2 is approximately 3.5 A from the zinc ion and interacts with His-94, His-119, Val-121, Val-143, Leu-198, Thr-199, the zinc ion, and the zinc-bound hydroxide ion. The second CO2 binding site is approximately 6 A from the zinc ion, where CO2 interacts with His-64, His-94, Leu-198, Thr-200, Pro-201, Pro-202, and some active-site water molecules. The third CO2 binding site is approximately 10 A from the zinc ion, is largely solvated by water molecules, and interacts with His-64, Asn-67, and Gln-92. At these three CO2 binding sites, the CO2 molecule is highly localized (the average Zn-CO2 distance fluctuation is approximately 1 A) and favors the linear binding orientation toward the zinc ion. This linear binding orientation of CO2 and its electrostatic interaction with the zinc ion direct diffusion of CO2 toward the zinc ion and facilitate the nucleophilic attack from O of the zinc-bound OH- to C of CO2 in the productive hydrophobic binding site. Finally, the two CO2 binding sites outside the hydrophobic binding pocket, which may represent two intermediate states along the CO2 binding pathway, could play important roles as a CO2 relay.\r"

  ".U": "90251626\r", 
  ".W": "The araC gene of Escherichia coli encodes a protein that binds the inducer L-arabinose to activate the transcription of three ara operons. In a study to determine the functional domains within the AraC protein, we have generated a set of overlapping deletions from the proximal end of the araC gene. We found that the removal of up to nearly 60% of the coding sequence of this protein still allows transcriptional activation of the ara operons in vivo, up to 27% that of the wild type. These truncated proteins, however, no longer require arabinose for induction. The ligand-induced conformational change apparently either releases or unmasks an existing functional domain within AraC, rather than generating a new conformation that is required for activation of the promoter of araBAD. Since the truncated protein of the mutant C154 (which lacks 153 amino acid residues from the N terminus) retains DNA binding specificity, the DNA-recognition domain is localized in the C-terminal half of the AraC protein. Truncated proteins were unable to repress araBAD or araC in vivo, even though they were able to bind all ara operators. We propose that the N-terminal half of AraC is essential for the formation of the DNA loops that are responsible for repression of araBAD and for autoregulation of araC.\r"

By screening mouse lambda ZAP expression libraries with the ICS as a probe, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a protein that binds the ICS, designated ICSBP. Protein blot analysis with labeled oligonucleotide probes showed that ICSBP binds not only the MHC class I ICS but also IFN response motifs of many IFN-regulated genes, as well as a virus-inducible element of the IFN-beta gene. The ICSBP cDNA encodes 424 amino acids and a long 3' untranslated sequence. The N-terminal 115 amino acids correspond to a putative DNA-binding domain and show significant sequence similarity with other cloned IFN response factors (IRF-1 and IRF-2). Because of the structural similarity and shared binding specificity, we conclude that ICSBP is a third member of the IRF gene family, presumably playing a role in IFN- and virus-mediated regulation of many genes. Although IRF-1 and IRF-2 share some similarity in their C-terminal regions, ICSBP shows no similarity to IRF-1 or IRF-2 in this region, suggesting that it is more distantly related. We show that ICSBP mRNA is expressed predominantly in lymphoid tissues and is inducible preferentially by IFN-gamma. The induction by IFN-gamma appears to be predominant in lymphocytes and macrophages, implying that ICSBP plays a regulatory role in cells of the immune system. The presence of multiple factors that bind common IFN response motifs may partly account for the complexity and diversity of IFN action as well as IFN-regulated gene expression.\r"

In this study we have examined the transcriptional regulation of the bvgABC operon. Transcriptional bvg::lacZYA fusions in Escherichia coli show that the bvgABC operon is autogenously activated. Autoactivation is inhibited by the same environmental stimuli that result in the lack of expression of bvg-activated genes in B. pertussis. These observations were confirmed in B. pertussis using a chromosomal chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcriptional fusion in bvgC. Transcriptional initiation sites upstream of bvgA were mapped by primer extension analysis in E. coli and B. pertussis. Two differentially regulated bvg promoters were identified. The bvgP1 promoter is a positively autoregulated promoter located 90 base pairs upstream of bvgA. The bvgP2 promoter is located 141 base pairs upstream of bvgA and does not appear to require any positive regulatory factors for activity. These results suggest a model describing the regulatory events that take place upstream of the bvgABC operon.\r"

The leucine-zipper and basic-region domains of both Fos and Jun are necessary for formation of the heterodimer that binds to DNA. Reciprocal mutations in the basic region of Fos or Jun can influence the binding of the heterodimer to DNA, implying a symmetrical binding site. DNA-binding mutants of Jun exhibit increased affinity for Fos and are capable of suppressing wild-type Fos-Jun DNA-binding activity. In contrast, mutations in the basic domain of Fos, which prevent binding to DNA in association with Jun, do not significantly diminish the ability of the wild-type heterodimer to bind to DNA. These dominant negative mutants are functional in vivo and can be exploited to study the role of Fos and Jun in normal and transformed cells.\r"

This gene, named GPA1, was isolated by using a DNA probe generated by polymerase chain reaction based on protein sequences from mammalian and yeast G protein alpha subunits. The sequences of genomic and cDNA clones indicate that GPA1 has 14 exons, and the deduced amino acid sequence shows that the GPA1 gene product (GP alpha 1) has 383 amino acid residues (44,582 Da). The GP alpha 1 protein exhibits similarity to all known G protein alpha subunits--36% of its amino acids are identical and 73% are similar (identical and conservative changes) to mammalian inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory factor alpha subunits and transducins. Furthermore, the GP alpha 1 protein has all of the consensus regions for a GTP-binding protein. The GPA1-encoded mRNA of 1.55 kilobases is most abundant in vegetative plant tissues, as determined by RNA blot analysis. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping experiments show that GPA1 is approximately 1.2 centimorgans from the visible marker er on chromosome 2.\r"

A 31-base-pair sequence found approximately 420 base pairs upstream of the gene encoding human transforming growth factor beta 1 acted as a ras-responsive enhancer element in transient transfection assays. The human sequence contains the element TGACTCT that also is found in a murine ras-responsive enhancer. Analysis of nuclear factors present in cells stably transformed by ras indicated that both human and murine sequences were recognized by the same nuclear factor. The role of fos and jun in ras transcriptional activation was analyzed in transfection assays using murine elements that contained either TGACTCT or TGAGTAA. These experiments showed that while both elements are activated by fos/jun expression to nearly the same event, only the former element responded to ras. In addition, activation of reporters containing TGACTCT is 6-fold higher by ras than by fos/jun. Gel retention experiments revealed that the nuclear factor present in cells transformed by ras exhibited the same sequence preference as demonstrated in the transient transfection assays. UV-crosslinking experiments identify a protein of apparent molecular mass 120 kDa that recognizes the ras-responsive element. This work identifies a persistent signal transduction pathway that links ras to nuclear transcription and indicates that a 120-kDa protein is a target of this pathway.\r"

To evaluate whether the initial increase in c-fos mRNA is causally related to the subsequent increase in NGF mRNA, we performed experiments with fibroblasts of transgenic mice carrying an exogenous c-fos gene under the control of a metallothionein promoter. In primary cultures of these fibroblasts, CdCl2 evoked a rapid increase in exogenous c-fos mRNA, followed immediately by an increase in endogenous c-jun mRNA and with a slight delay by an increase in NGF mRNA. In fibroblasts of C3H control mice, CdCl2 had no effect on the mRNA levels of the protooncogenes c-fos and c-jun or of NGF. Additional evidence for a causal relationship between c-fos induction and the subsequent increase in NGF mRNA was obtained in cotransfection experiments. Fibroblasts of C3H control mice were cotransfected with a metallothionein-promoter-driven c-fos expression vector and a NGF promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construct. Induction of the exogenous c-fos by CdCl2 resulted in increased activity of the NGF promoter. DNase I footprint experiments demonstrated that a binding site for transcription factor AP-1 (Fos/Jun heterodimer) in the first intron of the NGF gene was protected following c-fos induction. That this protected AP-1 site indeed was functional in the regulation of NGF expression was verified by deletion experiments and by a point mutation in the corresponding AP-1 binding region in the NGF promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct.\r"

Affected mice, of genotype gusmps/gusmps, present clinical manifestations similar to those of humans with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly syndrome) and are shown here to have secondary elevations of other lysosomal enzymes. The mucopolysaccharidosis VII phenotype in both species includes dwarfism, skeletal deformities, and premature death. Lysosome storage is visualized within enlarge vesicles and correlates biochemically with accumulation of undegraded and partially degraded glycosaminoglycans. In this report we describe the consequences of introducing the human beta-glucuronidase gene, GUSB, into gusmps/gusmps mice that produce virtually no murine beta-glucuronidase. Transgenic mice homozygous for the mucopolysaccharidosis VII mutation expressed high levels of human beta-glucuronidase activity in all tissues examined and were phenotypically normal. Biochemically, both the intralysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans and the secondary elevation of other acid hydrolases were corrected. These findings demonstrate that the GUSB transgene is expressed in gusmps/gusmps mice and that human beta-glucuronidase corrects the murine mucopolysaccharidosis storage disease.\r"

  ".W": "A probe-free method was developed to detect DNA rearrangement in bacteria based on the electrophoretic separation of twice-digested restriction fragments of genomic DNA into a two-dimensional (2-D) pattern. The first restriction enzyme digestion was done in solution, followed by electrophoresis of the restriction fragments in one dimension. A second restriction enzyme digestion was carried out in situ in the gel, followed by electrophoresis in a second dimension perpendicular to the first electrophoresis. The 2-D pattern provides for the resolution of 300-400 spots, which are defined and indexed by an \"x,y\" coordinate system with size markers. This approach has greatly increased the resolution power over conventional one-dimensional (1-D) electrophoresis. To study DNA rearrangement, a 2-D pattern from a test strain was compared with the 2-D pattern from a reference strain. After the first digestion, genomic DNA fragments from the test strain were labeled with 35S, while those from the reference strain were labeled with 35P. This was done to utilize the difference in the energy emission of 35S and 32P isotopes for autoradiography when two x-ray films were exposed simultaneously on top of the gel after the 2-D electrophoresis. The irradiation from the decay of 35S exposed only the lower film, whereas the irradiation from the decay of 32P exposed both the lower and upper films. Different DNA fragments existed in the test DNA compared with the reference DNA can be identified unambiguously by the differential two 2-D patterns produced on two films upon exposure to the 35S and 32P fragments in the same gel. An appropriate photographic procedure further simplified the process, allowing only the difference in DNA fragments between these two patterns to be shown in the map. We have utilized the difference map obtained from Escherichia coli strains HB101 and HB101 (lambda) genomic DNA to show the incorporation of one copy of phage lambda DNA without the use of a lambda DNA probe. This is the same test system that was used previously.\r"

In both cases, the polypeptide chains were correctly processed, glycosylated, and assembled into normal H2L2 (H = heavy, L = light) immunoglobulin monomers. These molecules bound antigen and expressed both polyclonal idiotype and monoclonal idiotopes. Furthermore, the transfer vectors described have been modified to contain the F1 origin of replication for the production of single-stranded DNA, which facilitates site-specific mutations of either the polyhedrin promoter or the inserted foreign gene. Use of this system should significantly advance the analysis of the structural bases for both idiotype expression and antigen binding by immunoglobulin. More importantly, it provides a generic method for the high-level expression of antibodies of diverse interest.\r"

An antiserum directed against the amino terminus of beta-amyloid stained numerous tangle-bearing cells and bodies, as well as the neuritic component of plaques and neuropil threads.

  ".W": "Identification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals is of paramount importance for the control of the spread of AIDS worldwide. Currently, the vast majority of screening centers throughout the world rely on serological techniques. As such, clinically asymptomatic but HIV-infected, seronegative individuals are rarely identified. In this report we show that 18% (30/165) of seronegative individuals who were considered to be a unique cohort of patients at high risk for HIV infection had circulating B cells that, upon in vitro polyclonal activation with pokeweed mitogen, produced antibodies reactive with HIV. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA obtained from aliquots of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these seronegative but pokeweed mitogen assay-positive individuals tested revealed the presence of HIV-specific sequences in a significant number of samples. In addition, depletion of CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-1-seronegative individuals prior to in vitro culture with pokeweed mitogen resulted in increased sensitivity for detecting HIV-reactive antibodies. This assay has obvious epidemiological implications, especially in the case of high-risk groups, and also provides a simple technique to enhance detection of HIV-infected individuals. Of further interest is the determination of the mechanisms related to the lack of HIV-specific antibodies in the serum of these infected individuals.\r"

We used autoradiography to study postischemic L-type Ca2+ channels (1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker binding), adenosine A1 receptors, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the rat hippocampus using [3H]PN200-110 (PN), [3H]cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), respectively, in 49 rats subjected to 20 minutes of forebrain ischemia. The rats were decapitated after 1 (n = 7), 3 (n = 7), 6 (n = 8), 12 (n = 7), 24 (n = 6), 48 (n = 6), or 168 (n = 8) hours of recirculation; eight control rats were sham-operated but experienced no cerebral ischemia. Reduced receptor binding preceding the delayed death of CA1 pyramidal cells was first observed in the stratum oriens of the CA1 subfield. Significant reductions in [3H]PN, [3H]CHA, and [3H]QNB bindings of this stratum compared with control were noticed after 3 (35%, p less than 0.01), 12 (31%, p less than 0.01), and 1 (10%, p less than 0.05) hours of recirculation, respectively. By 168 hours after ischemia (when the populations of CA1 pyramidal cells were depleted) all strata in the CA1 subfield had lost most of their receptor sites, and [3H]PN, [3H]CHA, and [3H]QNB bindings in the stratum oriens were decreased to 23%, 30%, and 63% of control (p less than 0.01). Although [3H]PN binding in the CA3 subfield did not change significantly during 168 hours after ischemia, the histologically intact dentate gyrus exhibited a 31% loss of binding sites compared with control (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To study the pathophysiology of intracerebral hemorrhage, we produced experimental hemorrhages in 53 rats and characterized the lesion by histology, brain water content, and behavior. Adult rats had 2 microliters saline containing 0.5 unit bacterial collagenase infused into the left caudate nucleus. Histologically, erythrocytes were seen around blood vessels at the needle puncture site within the first hour. By 4 hours there were hematomas, the size of which depended on the amount of collagenase injected. Necrotic masses containing fluid, blood cells, and fibrin were seen at 24 hours. Lipid-filled macrophages were observed at 7 days and cysts at 3 weeks. Water content was significantly increased 4, 24, and 48 hours after infusion at the needle puncture site and for 24 hours in posterior brain sections. Behavioral abnormalities were present for 48 hours, with recovery of function occurring during the first week. Brain tissue contains Type IV collagen in the basal lamina. Collagenase, which occurs in an inactive form in cells, is released and activated during injury, leading to disruption of the extracellular matrix. Collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage is a reproducible animal model for the study of the effects of the hematoma and brain edema.\r"

While it is conceivable that this mutation could have been transferred from one haplotype background to another by a double crossover or gene conversion event, the fact that the mutation is exclusively associated with the two different haplotypes in the two distinct populations supports the hypothesis that these two PKU alleles are the result of recurrent mutations in the human PAH gene.

  ".W": "We tested 132 individuals from 21 families segregating an allele for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), by using nine RFLPs tightly linked to the NF-1 locus. Family members had requested DNA testing either to determine whether \"at risk\" children were carrying the NF-1 allele or to determine whether their respective families would be informative for prenatal testing. Predictions about whether a child carries the NF-1 mutation were possible for all 32 at-risk offspring (greater than 98% accuracy based on the recombination estimates currently available for these DNA markers). At least one informative probe was available for all 23 matings in these 21 families; flanking markers were informative for 10 matings. Pairwise analysis showed that several of the polymorphisms were in tight linkage disequilibrium; few recombination events were observed with these markers in the families under study. We conclude that the DNA probes used in this study perform well for diagnostic testing of NF-1 in familial cases. A subset of five probe-enzyme systems (pHHH202/RsaI, p11-3C4.2/MspI, pTH17.19/Bg/II, p11-2C11.7/BamHI, and p11-2F9.8/TaqI) provide reliable linkage information for both clinical testing and prenatal diagnosis.\r"

This article outlines the spectrum of B. catarrhalis disease in childhood and the extent of the evidence for a pathogenic role of the organism. B. catarrhalis is a rare etiologic agent in septicemia, meningitis, and other systemic illness in both apparently normal and immunocompromised infants and children. It is an unusual cause of ophthalmia neonatorum, but can be confused with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Whether or not B. catarrhalis is acquired from the birth canal in these cases has not been established. B. catarrhalis is most common as a respiratory tract pathogen in children, including pneumonia, bacterial tracheitis, sinusitis, and otitis media. Since it is difficult to rigorously document pathogenicity of any bacterium in bronchopulmonary infections in children, it is probable that the spectrum of B. catarrhalis disease is wider than that reported to date. The evidence for pathogenicity in acute otitis media is more extensive than for other infections. Otitis media due to B. catarrhalis is clinically similar to that due to other pathogens. B. catarrhalis can be isolated in pure culture from the middle ear exudate and persists if there is no antibacterial treatment. Gram-negative intracellular and extracellular diplococci can be seen on smears of the inflammatory exudate. There is preliminary evidence that there is an antibody response in B. catarrhalis otitis media. B. catarrhalis has emerged as an important and common pathogen in neonates, infants, and children.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with sputum samples that met cellular criteria as quality samples and that grew B. catarrhalis as the sole pathogen were identified retrospectively from microbiology records at a regional referral hospital for cardiac and pulmonary diseases. Records of these patients were reviewed to identify patients with radiographic findings of pneumonia. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of these patients were then studied in detail. RESULTS: Forty-two patients who met the criteria for B. catarrhalis pneumonia were identified. Most patients were elderly (over 65 years; 55 percent), malnourished (69 percent), and had severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or another serious underlying disease (98 percent). The seasonal incidence of this pneumonia was October through April (88 percent), with the annual number of cases having increased since 1982. The clinical presentation was typically mild. Interstitial or mixed interstitial-alveolar infiltrates superimposed on pre-existing chronic lung disease was the most common radiographic finding. Approximately 90 percent of sputa were acceptable for Gram stain and contained 10 to more than 50 gram-negative cocci/1,000 x field. All cultures produced a heavy growth of B. catarrhalis, with 67 percent of strains positive for beta-lactamase. No patient had identified bacteremia (zero of 25 tested). Therapy with numerous agents including cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resulted in a good clinical and bacteriologic response. However, 45 percent of patients died of their underlying diseases on this admission or within three months. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a good profile of B. catarrhalis pneumonia. Despite the mild character of the illness, the pneumonia occurs in patients with end-stage pulmonary or malignant disease and almost 50 percent of patients die of their underlying diseases within three months.\r"

In most instances, pathogenicity is presumed by recovery of the organism in a sputum culture, a method that is less than conclusive. In order to better diagnose B. catarrhalis infections, an enzyme-linked immunoassay has been developed using P-protein as antigen to measure antibodies to B. catarrhalis. In 17 elderly patients with B. catarrhalis pneumonia and 12 with tracheobronchitis, acute-phase serum antibody titers to P-protein were found to be significantly increased when compared with those of normal subjects (both p less than 0.02). There were no differences in antibody titers between patients with pneumonia and tracheobronchitis. Antibody titers of convalescent-phase sera increased over those of acute-phase sera in 46 percent of pneumonia patients and 50 percent of tracheobronchitis patients. The results demonstrated that lower respiratory tract infections with B. catarrhalis promote a significant elevation in antibody response to P-protein of B. catarrhalis.\r"

An emphasis is placed on attributes of this organism that are relevant to its recovery and identification in the clinical microbiology laboratory. In addition, characteristics useful in determining strain identity for use in epidemiologic investigations are addressed. Finally, factors are discussed that may account for the infection-causing potential of B. catarrhalis or at least are of potential consequence to investigations of the pathogenesis of Branhamella disease. CONCLUSIONS: B. catarrhalis is readily isolated from human clinical specimens and can be easily identified using simple, rapid laboratory techniques. Restriction endonuclease analysis of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid has proven to be a useful tool in epidemiologic studies. Beta-lactamase isoelectric focusing is of limited value because of the small number of distinct patterns. The lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane proteins of B. catarrhalis have been characterized and found to be relatively non-varying among different strains. Circumstantial evidence exists in support of the hypothesis that the B. catarrhalis beta-lactamase is a virulence determinant.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if Branhamella catarrhalis expresses type 4 pili. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Piliated B. catarrhalis phenotypic characteristics of colony morphology, agar corrosion, twitching motility, competence for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) transformation, autoagglutination, and pellical formation were observed. DNA was isolated from Branhamella spp. and used in genomic Southern hybridizations with a Moraxella bovis pilin gene as a probe. Electron microscopy of negatively stained bacteria was carried out to visualize pili. RESULTS: B. catarrhalis has several (but not all) of the phenotypic characteristics that are related to the presence of type 4 (MePhe) pili in closely related Moraxella spp., including competence for DNA transformation, autoagglutination, pellicle formation, colony morphology, and pitting of agar. The one phenotype we have not found that is generally characteristic of type 4 piliated bacteria is twitching motility. Genomic Southern hybridization analysis using a cloned M. bovis Q pilin gene as a probe reveals DNA homologous to the Q pilin gene in B. catarrhalis, Branhamella ovis, Branhamella caviae, and Branhamella cuniculi. Examination of B. catarrhalis strain ATCC25240 by electron microscopy reveals two different kinds of pili. One kind appears similar to other type 4 pili, whereas a second class is short pili extending outward from all portions of the bacteria. CONCLUSION: Phenotypic, electron-microscopic, and hybridization data are all consistent with type 4 pili being present on some B. catarrhalis strains.\r"

Therefore, studies of the outer membrane have been undertaken in order to identify virulence factors and begin to understand the immune response to infection.

The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of 50 strains from diverse sources were isolated by simpler methods and studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Experiments were designed to identify OMPs that express determinants on the surface of the intact bacterium. RESULTS: Eight major OMPs have been identified (OMPs A through H). The OMP patterns from diverse strains were strikingly similar. OMP E (approximately 56,000 daltons) and OMP G (approximately 28,000 daltons) have determinants that are surface-exposed and these determinants are shared among a majority of strains of B. catarrhalis. CONCLUSION: These observations have important implications with regard to the immune response to infection and future vaccine development.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To summarize current knowledge of drug susceptibility and mechanisms of drug resistance in Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current medical literature was reviewed, with careful attention to recent studies of the BRO beta-lactamases. RESULTS: Although intrinsically resistant to a small group of drugs that included vancomycin and trimethoprim, acquired drug resistance in Branhamella catarrhalis was unknown in the early years of antimicrobial therapy. During 1976 to 1977, however, two previously unrecognized beta-lactamases appeared in this species almost simultaneously around the world. At the same time these enzymes, now known as BRO-1 and BRO-2, also appeared in two closely related commensal species of Moraxella. Within four years the BRO enzymes were found in up to 75 percent of B. catarrhalis in the United States where they provide low-level resistance to penicillin and ampicillin but not to most cephalosporins. The BRO genes appear to be chromosomal but are readily transferred by conjugation within the Moraxella genus. Resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been reported from Spain, and resistance to both erythromycin and tetracycline has recently been described among United States isolates of B. catarrhalis. CONCLUSION: Despite this drug resistance, numerous oral and parenteral agents are available and appear useful for treatment of clinical disease, including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, erythromycin, the tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Recent changes in drug resistance in this species suggest that continued monitoring of drug resistance in B. catarrhalis is needed.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To assess the ecologic impact, in terms of selection of beta-lactamase-producing respiratory tract bacteria, of a single course of peroral beta-lactam antibiotics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One-hundred fifty consecutive children with clinical signs of bacterial respiratory tract infection were randomly assigned to a seven-day course of treatment with either penicillin V, amoxicillin, or cefaclor. Bacteriologic specimens were collected before treatment, at its termination, and at follow-up four weeks later. RESULTS: All three drugs investigated caused a similar increase in beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, both in absolute and relative terms, an increase that persisted over a period of at least one month after completion of treatment. CONCLUSION: Penicillin V, amoxicillin, and cefaclor all act as selective agents for beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the upper respiratory tract. Treatment with a peroral beta-lactam antibiotic puts patients at risk of becoming persistent carriers of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: This work reviewed existing literature pertaining to the epidemiologic aspects of respiratory tract infections caused by Branhamella catarrhalis, examined certain epidemiologic features of B. catarrhalis infections occurring at this facility, and identified relevant areas in need of further study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Literature dealing with the epidemiology of B. catarrhalis infections was reviewed. Records in this Veterans Administration hospital microbiology laboratory were reviewed and all B. catarrhalis isolates and pure cultures of Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were noted for the January 1986 to June 1989 study period. RESULTS: B. catarrhalis is now recognized as a disease-causing pathogen that is particularly noted for its association with acute otitis media in children and lower respiratory tract infections in adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. It was recovered from 2.7 percent of all respiratory specimens submitted over a 42-month period at this Veterans hospital. When compared with H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis was found to be the second most commonly isolated respiratory pathogen. It was frequently found in pure culture (53 percent) or in combination with H. influenzae, gram-negative bacilli, or S. pneumoniae. The seasonal recovery of B. catarrhalis was apparent for the November to May period compared with the June to October period (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: B. catarrhalis has emerged as a major respiratory pathogen in pediatric and adult patient populations. There is a distinct seasonal pattern associated with its recovery and reasons for this are unclear. Prevalence studies aimed at identifying colonization rates among \"low\" and \"high\" risk groups are needed. The availability of restriction endonuclease analysis as a typing system for B. catarrhalis should favorably impact upon future epidemiologic studies. Many B. catarrhalis isolates produce beta-lactamase, and therapeutic options must reflect this.\r"

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist was administered subcutaneously at doses of 10, 30, 100, and 300 micrograms/kg. Suppression of immunoactive luteinizing hormone concentrations was achieved with a 30 micrograms/kg dose of antagonist. Suppression of immunoactive follicle-stimulating hormone levels was less (40%) even at the highest antagonist dose (300 micrograms/kg). Bioactive luteinizing hormone concentrations also significantly decreased (greater than 60%) at the two antagonist doses tested (30 and 300 micrograms/kg). However, the lower antagonist dose showed an \"escape\" of bioactive luteinizing hormone values after 18 hours. No suppressive effects of the antagonist on prolactin secretion occurred at any dose tested. We conclude that this gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist can achieve effective, potent, and long-lasting suppression of pituitary secretion of biologically active luteinizing hormone at higher doses, but secretion of biologically active luteinizing hormone may \"escape\" at lower doses.\r"

Annual censuses were begun in 1973. At 3 year intervals from 1974 to 1983, the population was examined serologically and subjected to electrocardiography using standardized techniques. Of 1,751 individuals registered during the 10 censuses, 1,541 (88%) were examined serologically at least once. Of 747 individuals in constant residence and originally seronegative, 24 were seropositive upon subsequent evaluation, giving a seroconversion rate of 4.92/1,000 person-years (PY). The overall rate of development of an abnormal ECG was 25.7/1,000 PY for seropositive individuals and 12.5/1,000 PY for seronegative individuals, a relative risk of 2. The 10-14-year-old seropositive group had the highest risk of developing ECG abnormalities (24.1/1,000 PY, relative risk = 3.5). The age-adjusted mortality rate of seropositive individuals was slightly higher than for seronegative individuals (8.9 vs. 7.8/1,000 PY). In sero-positive individuals, mortality was strongly associated with the presence of ventricular conduction defects and arrhythmias. Ventricular conduction defects appeared most frequently in younger individuals. Older individuals presented the highest risk of development of frequent and multifocal extrasystoles.\r"

The project, begun in 1983, was focused on reducing prevalence, intensity, and morbidity due to schistosomiasis by providing diagnosis and treatment with praziquantel to schoolchildren. Schools were visited twice. Following the completion of the school surveys, the program was extended into the community. Chemotherapy was delivered by mobile and static teams. The evaluation indicated that, with respect to accuracy of diagnosis, record-keeping, and coverage of targeted populations, project tasks were performed exceedingly well by highly motivated, well-supervised mobile teams. Static teams in rural health centers were less successful in providing diagnosis and chemotherapy to village populations. We resurveyed 6 randomly selected schools to assess the impact of chemotherapy. Overall, the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection was reduced from 60.3% to 24.8% between the first and second surveys (approximately 1 year apart) and was still lower (41.1%) than initial levels up to 3 years after the last treatment with praziquantel. The percentages of those with greater than or equal to 34 S. mansoni eggs/slide using the Kato-Katz technique showed a marked and prolonged decrease (17.1% to 0.3% to 2.2%). The prevalence of S. haematobium infection dropped from 37.6% to 5.5% and was still 9.9% at the time of the evaluation. The percentages of those with greater than or equal to 50 S. haematobium eggs/10 ml urine dropped less dramatically (17% to 4.4% to 11.9%). Mobile teams conducting vigorous chemotherapy programs targeted at schoolchildren can have long-lasting benefits in terms of prevalence and intensity.\r"

There were no side reactions except for mild local soreness at the injection site in 3 patients. At 12 months, all subjects seroconverted (antibody levels greater than 10 mIU/mL); 24 patients (80%) developed antibody levels greater than 1,000 mIU/mL. As with a plasma-derived vaccine, antibody levels were negatively correlated with increasing spleen size.

Normal platelets showed significantly weaker aggregation responses to a sub-maximal dose of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) when mixed with plasma from 10 patients with AHF (mean percent of control +/- 1 SE = 57.2 +/- 6.7%) compared to those mixed with plasma from 9 viral control patients (79.5 +/- 4.1%; P less than 0.05) and 9 febrile patients with septicemia (103.8 +/- 3%; P less than 0.001). Plasma from 3 patients with severe AHF inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the aggregation responses of normal platelets to collagen, sodium arachidonate, a calcium ionophore (A23187), and ristocetin; none of 4 samples from convalescent AHF patients showed this inhibitory activity. The platelet inhibition was sudden in onset and unaffected by a 30 min pre-incubation, not neutralized by convalescent plasma with high titer antibody to Junin virus, and abolished after heating plasma from an AHF patient at 56 degrees C for 30 min. Hemorrhage in AHF is associated with the presence of a circulating inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and disturbed hemostasis in arenavirus-induced hemorrhagic fevers may have a common basis.\r"

The mechanism for this is thought to be the release of histamine and other mediators from airway mast cells. We studied the effect of a potent and selective H1 receptor antagonist on the airway response to nonisotonic aerosols (NIA) in 12 asthmatic subjects 19 to 57 yr of age. Terfenadine (T) (180 mg) or its placebo (P) was given 150 min before challenge with NIA. The FEV1 was measured before and after the inhalation of aerosols of isotonic (0.9%), hypertonic (1.8, 3.6, 4.5, and 5.4%), and hypotonic NaCl (0.6, 0.3, and 0%) aerosols. Each concentration of aerosol was inhaled for 3 min, and each day the concentration was increased or decreased until a 20% fall in FEV1 was recorded. Terfenadine caused a significant reduction in airway narrowing as assessed by (1) the percent fall in FEV1 (hypertonic mean +/- 1 SD P, 26.1 +/- 9.5 versus T, 15.6 +/- 14, p = 0.025; hypotonic P, 29.8 +/- 13.1 versus T, 16.6 +/- 13.1, p less than 0.02); (2) the lowest FEV1 percent predicted (%FEV1) (hypertonic P, 61 +/- 13 versus T, 76 +/- 16, p less than 0.005; hypotonic P, 56 +/- 10 versus T, 78 +/- 14, p less than 0.001) documented at the dose common to both placebo and terfenadine test days; (3) the difference in %FEV1 before and after challenge (hypertonic, p less than 0.034; hypotonic, p less than 0.035).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hemodynamics, blood gases, and plasma hormone levels were measured (1) while patients received supplemental O2; (2) after 30 min O2 discontinuation; and (3) after a 30-min period of 96% O2 breathing. Plasma immunoreactive ANF concentrations were 196 +/- 50 pg/ml during O2 breathing and were positively related to transmural pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (tPpaw, r = 0.90, p less than 0.001) and to PaCO2 (r = 0.57, p less than 0.02). Compared to normal subjects matched for age and sex, patients had higher plasma ANF levels (196 +/- 52 versus 72 +/- 6 pg/ml, p less than 0.01), similar PRA (2.1 +/- 0.5 versus 1.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/h, NS), and slightly lower plasma Aldo (98 +/- 17 versus 156 +/- 19 pg/ml, p less than 0.05).

Recently, the American Thoracic Society-California Thoracic Society Blood Gas Proficiency Testing Survey distributed the same lot of ampules of proficiency testing material (a buffered fluorocarbon-containing emulsion) on three occasions within a 1-yr period, allowing us to assess the precision (reproducibility) of measurement of each analyte. Comparing 580 instruments of 13 models, we found that the precision of measurement of each analyte was positively correlated with the precision of measurement of each other analyte, and the correlation of precision between models was much stronger than precision between the individual instruments. We also found correlation of precision of each analyte with two targets for accuracy: (1) the all-instrument mean and (2) the model-specific means. Correlations were higher with the model-specific means. These findings suggest: (1) that features unique to design of each model are important in the precision of measurement of these ampules, and (2) that it would be informative to include measurements of precision with linked and cumulative ratings of analyte accuracy in proficiency testing rating systems.\r"

In the present study, we have explored (1) the prevalence and magnitude of PEEPi in stable COPD patients, and (2) the correlation of PEEPi with respiratory mechanics and PaCO2. In 96 stable COPD patients with varying degrees of airway obstruction, we measured pulmonary flow resistance (RL), dynamic lung compliance (CLdyn), breathing pattern, arterial blood gases, and dynamic PEEPi. Dynamic PEEPi was determined as a negative deflection in esophageal pressure from the start of inspiratory effort to the onset of inspiratory flow. A significant correlation was found between dynamic PEEPi and FEVi (% predicted; r = -0.56, p less than 0.001), between PEEPi and RL (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001), and between PaCO2 and PEEPi (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001). These results indicate that increased severity of airway obstruction promotes PEEPi and concomitant dynamic hyperinflation. This implies increased inspiratory work in the face of decreased effectiveness of the inspiratory muscles as pressure generators. The present results suggest that dynamic hyperinflation may play a role in causing chronic hypoventilation in COPD patients.\r"

It seemed likely that when the tubercle bacilli were less numerous, i.e., could not be seen on microscopy, less therapy would suffice. Thus, in January 1980, we began giving only 6 months of treatment to patients in whom at least one sputum culture showed M. tuberculosis but at least three sputum smears showed no organisms. The regimen for adults is INH 300 mg and RIF 600 mg daily for 1 month followed by INH 900 mg and RIF 600 mg twice weekly for another 5 months. To date, 286 patients with an average age of 68.2 yr have been treated in this manner. Associated medical conditions were present as \"risk factors\" in 23.7%. The full course of therapy could not be completed in 75 patients (26.2%), largely because of side effects of the drugs and non-TB deaths in this group of elderly patients. Side effects of the drugs requiring change of drug(s) occurred in 33 patients (11.5%), but major side effects occurred in only eight (2.8%), four (1.4%) with toxic hepatitis and four with hematologic toxicity. The side effects in 25 patients (8.7%) were not life-threatening and were due to drug intolerance. Treatment failed during therapy in only one patient. The full 6-month course of therapy was completed by 211 patients. During follow-up from 3 to 107 months (median, 45 months), five of 211 patients (2.4%) relapsed, all with drug-susceptible organisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "HIV-related lymphocytic alveolitis is common in HIV-seropositive patients without lung infection or tumor. In some of them a fraction of alveolar lymphocytes are HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) bearing the CD8 and D44 cell surface markers and capable of killing HIV-infected alveolar macrophages. In order to evaluate the in vivo effect of these CTL on lung function, we measured the pulmonary clearance of aerosolized 99mTc-diethylene triamine penta-acetate (DTPA-CI) on 24 occasions in 22 patients with lymphocytic alveolitis. DTPA-CI has been selected as a highly sensitive test to detect injury of the lung epithelium. In 13 of the patients, we found a high DTPA-CI of 4.56 +/- 2.54%.min-1 (mean +/- SD), suggesting an increase of the epithelial permeability. The lymphocytic alveolitis was then characterized by a high cellularity, a high proportion of lymphocytes (59 +/- 18%), mainly composed of CD8+D44+ T-lymphocytes (149 +/- 109 cells/mm3), which spontaneously exhibited a cytolytic activity against the autologous alveolar macrophages in a standard 51Cr release assay. In the remaining 11 patients, DTPA-CI was normal (less than 1.78%.min-1), lymphocytic alveolitis being characterized by a low number or an absence of CD8+D44+ alveolar lymphocytes (9 +/- 13 cells/mm3) with no significant cytolytic activity. In the whole group, a significant correlation (r = 0.74, p = 0.0004) was found between the DTPA-CI and the number of CD8+D44+ lymphocytes and their cytotoxic activity against alveolar macrophages. Altogether, these results suggest that an injury of the lung epithelium could result from a HIV-specific CTL-induced immunologic conflict.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and meaning of antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients with nonalcoholic chronic liver diseases. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The liver unit of a referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Three hundred and forty-six consecutive patients, including 137 with cryptogenic chronic liver disease, 156 with chronic hepatitis B, 47 with primary biliary cirrhosis, and 8 with persistently abnormal aminotransferase serum levels and normal liver histology. Among patients with cryptogenic liver disease, 41 received blood transfusions before discovery of liver disease and 18 had circulating nonorgan-specific autoantibodies. For comparison, 1495 apparently healthy volunteer blood donors were included in the study. LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS: The presence of anti-HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) was determined by a recently developed enzyme-linked immunoassay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients with cryptogenic liver disease, the prevalence of anti-HCV was 82% (95% CI, 76% to 89%), being higher (P = 0.02) in patients with histories of blood transfusion than in those with unknown sources of exposure. Antibodies to HCV were not detected in patients with antinuclear antibodies at high titer. Among patients with chronic hepatitis B, anti-HCV were found in 11% (CI, 5% to 18%) of those with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated DNA in serum and in 29% (CI, 17% to 43%) of those with undetectable HBV replication (P less than 0.05). The prevalence of anti-HCV in blood donors was 1.2% (CI, 1.1% to 1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that HCV infection probably plays an important etiologic role in cryptogenic liver disease and, in some patients, in chronic hepatitis B. Determining whether anti-HCV are present appears to be useful for differentiating viral from autoimmune chronic liver diseases.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and cost effectiveness of alternative strategies for the evaluation and medical management of diarrhea in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN: Medical decision analysis using a decision tree. METHODS: Three management strategies were compared: full evaluation, which included stool culture, ova and parasite examination, stain for protozoa, blood cultures, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, and colonoscopy with biopsy; limited evaluation, which included stool culture, ova and parasite examination, stool stain for protozoa, and blood cultures; and minimal evaluation, which included only a stool culture. Treatment was based on the outcome of the diagnostic workup. Patients without a specific diagnosis were treated symptomatically with diphenoxylate hydrochloride. Nonrespondents to initial symptomatic treatment and patients with recurrent diarrhea after specific therapy were given the full evaluation. Average probabilities of diagnostic and therapeutic success were calculated from previous reports. Costs were compiled based on diagnostic and therapeutic expenditures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, the remission rates for diarrhea were 75.2%, 74.8%, and 74.8% in patients undergoing the full, limited, and minimal evaluations, respectively. The respective costs of the three strategies were $5419, $1997, and $1700 per patient in remission. A sensitivity analysis showed that the differences in efficacy and cost among the full, limited, and minimal strategies remained unchanged over a broad range of possible rates of diagnostic or therapeutic success. CONCLUSIONS: The minimal evaluation in all patients, with the full evaluation reserved only for nonrespondents to symptomatic treatment, is efficacious and is the most cost-effective strategy for managing AIDS-related diarrhea.\r"

Because zymosan activates complement and induces a systemic inflammatory response, the effect of zymosan on intestinal structure and barrier function was measured in normally nourished (NN) and protein malnourished (PM) mice. Normally nourished and protein malnourished (up to 21 days) mice challenged intraperitoneally with zymosan (0.1 mg/g body weight) were killed 24 hours after zymosan challenge and their organs cultured for translocating bacteria. Zymosan-induced bacterial translocation was limited to the mesenteric lymph nodes of the NN mice, whereas translocating bacteria spread from the gut to the liver, spleen, and blood stream (p less than 0.05) in the PM mice. Zymosan-induced bacterial translocation appeared to be related primarily to the combination of mucosal injury and a disruption of the gut flora ecology in the PM mice and to mucosal injury in the NN mice. The extent of mucosal injury was greater the longer the mice were protein malnourished before zymosan challenge. The effect of zymosan on survival was measured in separate groups of mice. At a dose of 0.1 mg/g body weight, no deaths occurred in NN mice or in 7-day PM mice. However 20% of the 14-day PM mice and 80% of the 21-day PM mice receiving zymosan died. Thus PM predisposes to mucosal damage and the development of potentially lethal gut origin septic state during periods of systemic inflammation.\r"

This study evaluated glucan, a macrophage stimulant, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study of 38 trauma patients undergoing surgery. Glucan (21 patients), 50 mg/m2, or placebo (17 patients) was given intravenously daily for 7 days. Delayed hypersensitivity skin testing was performed on days 1 and 7 after trauma. Serum interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were assayed after trauma. While the total mortality rate was significantly less in the glucan group (0% versus 29%) (p less than 0.05), the mortality rate from sepsis was not statistically different (0% versus 17.6%). Glucan therapy significantly decreased septic morbidity (9.5% versus 49%; p less than 0.05). Serum IL-1 had a greater increase in glucan patients on day 3 after trauma (143.4 +/- 19.3% versus 78.6 +/- 11.7%; p less than 0.05), but there was no difference thereafter. Serum TNF did not vary between groups. Early increase in IL-1 correlated with subsequent skin test conversion to positive. Neither serum IL-1 nor TNF was a reliable indicator of future sepsis. Further clinical trials are indicated to evaluate biologic response modifiers that activate macrophages in the trauma patient.\r"

  ".W": "For 11 patients with confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, we used reversible platelet inhibition with iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue, to permit safe heparin administration for cardiac (n = 9) or vascular (n = 2) operations. In vitro, iloprost (0.01 mumol/L) prevented both heparin-induced platelet aggregation and 14C-serotonin release in all patients. Therefore, intraoperatively, a continuous infusion of iloprost was started before administration of heparin and was continued until 15 minutes after administration of protamine. For cardiac patients, after heparin administration, the whole blood platelet count did not change (171,000 +/- 29,000/microL versus 174,000 +/- 29,000/microL, mean +/- standard error of the mean); no spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed, and plasma levels of the alpha-granule constituents platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin increased from 38 +/- 14 and 140 +/- 18 ng/mL to 591 +/- 135 and 235 +/- 48 ng/mL, respectively. Fibrinopeptide A levels actually decreased from 287 +/- 150 to 27 +/- 6 ng/mL. Furthermore, adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet activation was preserved, postoperative bleeding times were unchanged, and no heparin-related deaths occurred. Similar results were obtained in both vascular patients. We conclude that temporary platelet inhibition with iloprost now permits safe heparin administration in all patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia who require a cardiac or vascular operation.\r"

The SV produced 39.8 +/- 7.0, 66.7 +/- 9.1, and 123.6 +/- 15.1 pg/mg tissue of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha after 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 minutes, respectively, of incubation. The GEA produced significantly more 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha than SV at all three sampling times up to ten minutes of incubation (p less than 0.01). Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Prostacyclin production by the internal mammary artery was reported to be much higher than that of SV, and the patency rate of internal mammary artery grafts is reported to be better than that of SV grafts in coronary artery revascularization. Therefore, our results suggest that the patency rate of GEA grafts may be better than that of SV grafts in coronary artery revascularization. The GEA is a promising and excellent graft from the biochemical point of view.\r"

Readmitted otolaryngologic patients were found to have had greater hospital resource utilization, financial risk under diagnosis-related group payment, and mortality, compared with those patients not readmitted to our facility. For patients readmitted to otolaryngologic services (21.2% of total otolaryngologic patients), 20.4% of the readmissions occurred within 30 days of hospital discharge. Of these, 39.3% required one hospital readmission, 16.3% required two readmissions, and 46.4% of the patients called for three or more hospital admissions. Clinical factors were identified that resulted in a greater incidence of otolaryngologic readmission. Otolaryngologic patients readmitted to other clinical services were also studied. This analysis loads to the conclusion that inequities exist within the diagnosis related group hospital payment system vis-a-vis otolaryngologic readmissions. The results of these data also demonstrate leverage points in which we will be able to focus outpatient services for otolaryngologic patients requiring readmission and potentially decrease inpatient hospital expenditures in the days ahead.\r"

In addition, immature cells with the CD4+/CD8+ phenotype, most likely the precursors of mature circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, showed a marked susceptibility to viral infection and replication. These findings suggest that thymus infection may play a triggering role in the pathogenesis of AIDS, particularly in pediatric cases, and may partially explain the lack of restoration of peripheral CD4+ lymphocytes killed by HIV-1.\r"

Precise definition of the immunodominant epitopes present in gag gene proteins has potential clinical significance. Seventeen anti-gag monoclonal antibodies (MAb) were used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with antigens expressed by nine recombinant clones to define epitopes on HIV gag proteins which elicit an immune response. All of the MAbs tested, except two anti-p17, reacted with a clone which expresses the carboxyl terminal 13 amino acids of p17 and all of p24 and p15. All anti-p24 MAbs reacted with clones containing all of p24. MAbs reacted differentially with clones containing deleted regions depending on the antigenic portion expressed. Of thirteen potential identifiably different genomic regions which could be predicted from the genomic structure of the clones, eight different antigen epitopes were defined: two on p17, five on p24, and one on p15 (in the region corresponding to the carboxyl terminal protein p6). Six regions did not appear to react with any of the monoclonal antibodies available. Identification of the epitopes present in the cloned antigens should allow their use to evaluate sera from HIV-infected donors at different clinical stages of progression to AIDS.\r"

The presence of virus is evidenced by cytologic observation of syncytia or by detecting viral reverse transcriptase (RT) and/or p24 antigen in the culture supernatant fluid. Syncytia formation is almost always associated with the presence of virus as measured by RT, although many RT-positive cultures do not form syncytia. As part of a large screening program, we identified three cultures that showed syncytia but were RT negative. The basis for these discrepant observations was contamination of cultures with mycoplasma that interfered with the RT assay and thereby obscured virus detection. Treatment of cultures with BM-cycline removed mycoplasma contamination and restored RT activity. The present findings indicate the need for caution in the interpretation of negative RT results during HIV-1 isolation and especially in cultures that show evidence of syncytia formation.\r"

  ".W": "Studies on monitoring the immune response to viral structural proteins during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection have established the significance of antibodies to the core protein p24 during the progression of the disease. We have studied the prevalence of antibodies to the core protein p17 in order to study their diagnostic and prognostic significance in the pathogenesis of HIV-1. Full-length HIV-1 p17, molecularly cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using an HIV-1 p17-specific monoclonal antibody. A highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay was developed using the purified recombinant p17 as the serological target to detect antibodies to p17. The results indicated that antibodies to p17 decline during progression of disease, with the decline being more dramatic as patients moved from asymptomatic to AIDS-related complex (ARC). Patient specimens deficient in p24 antibody, but having detectable levels of antibody to p17 were almost always positive for p24 antigen. Under these conditions, p17 antibody is an important serological marker because it provides a more consistent marker for core antigens during HIV-1 infection.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), produces a chronic infection with a long latency before clinical disease. We followed 214 untreated subjects for 12-42 months to study the natural history of HIV infection: 110 were classified as asymptomatic, 11 as AIDS-related complex (ARC), 15 as AIDS with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), 31 as AIDS with opportunistic infections (AIDS/OI), and 47 were HIV-seronegative controls. The quantitative capacity of serum to complex HIV p24 antigen, termed the p24 binding capacity (p24 BC), and quantitative levels of HIV p24 antigen in serum were determined at regular intervals. For people in all diagnostic groups, a p24 BC below 31 ng/ml was more closely associated with progression to AIDS/OI than was p24 antigen positivity; 94% of AIDS/OI, 86% of ARC, 56% of AIDS/KS, and 19% of asymptomatic subjects had p24 BC less than 31 ng/ml during the study period, while 67% of AIDS/OI, 27% of ARC, 61% of AIDS/KS, and 20% of asymptomatic subjects were p24 antigenemic. Prospective analysis of 47 asymptomatic seropositive men followed for 3 years, who showed actuarial progression rates to ARC at 4%, 13%, and 23% and to AIDS at 5%, 8%, and 8% at 1, 2, and 3 years, indicated that entry levels of p24 BC below 31 ng/ml were as strongly associated with progression to ARC/AIDS as was p24 antigenemia (p = 0.0003 vs. p = 0.008). The p24 binding capacity assay is a new and convenient methodology to measure immunocomplexing antibody to HIV p24 and is a powerful indicator of progressive HIV disease.\r"

  ".W": "Serum and plasma samples were collected from blood donors who were confirmed positive for antibodies to HIV-1 in the United States, and from blood donors and individuals in West Africa and Portugal who were positive for antibodies to HIV-1, HIV-2, or both. Western blots and sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPA) utilizing native HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteins were performed on these specimens to determine the ability of these procedures to discriminate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections. Extensive serologic cross reactivity between HIV-1 and HIV-2 p24 was found in both populations. Antibody reactivity to the envelope protein gp120 was able to discriminate 20 of 20 (100%) U.S. specimens as HIV-1 infections. In specimens from West Africa and Portugal, Western blot and RIPA were in complete agreement on 33 of 42 samples (78.6%). Among these 33 specimens, 10 were found to be reactive for antibodies to HIV-1 only, 10 were reactive to HIV-2 only, and 13 were considered to be dually reactive, having antibodies reactive with both HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-2 gp120. Nine of the 42 specimens were discordant by Western blot and RIPA classification, being dually reactive by one procedure and reactive with only one viral gp120 by the other technique. Because of the serological cross reactivities between HIV-1 and HIV-2, in certain populations it is difficult to ascertain whether an individual is infected with HIV-1, HIV-2, a new viral type, or whether the individual is infected simultaneously with multiple viruses. More specific tests such as viral isolation or molecular probes may be necessary to distinguish between infections with these viruses in certain populations.\r"

  ".W": "To determine trends in a variety of dialysis-associated diseases and practices, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 1,734 chronic hemodialysis centers in the United States in 1988 in conjunction with the annual facility survey performed by the Health Care Financing Administration. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 91%. These 1,586 centers represented 107,804 patients and 28,501 staff members. Over the last 13 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.2% among patients and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of HBsAg-positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.5% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 90% of the centers. By the end of 1988, 17% of susceptible patients and 53% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1988, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg increased from 12 to 20% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1988 was reported to be 1.0% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. Fifteen percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients and 45% reported septicemia. The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 25%. In 1988, 67% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 72% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 2 to 50 (mean, 11) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was reused ranged from 3 to 131 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde; Renalin, a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide; and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were more frequently reported in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was only associated with centers that reused these dialyzers in a manual reprocessing system, a result consistent with those obtained in 1986 and 1987. Eighteen percent of centers reported treating at least some of their patients by high flux dialysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

IL-2 production was measured by 3H-thymidine-labelled CTLL-2 assay, and IFN-gamma production was measured by immunoradiometric assay using 2 mouse monoclonal antibodies. As a result, in high stage bladder cancer patients, the PHA blastogenic response, IL-2 production and IFN-gamma production were impaired. However, these parameters were not significantly different between low stage bladder cancer patients and control subjects. There was a significant correlation between the PHA blastogenic response and IL-2 production but no significant correlation between the PHA blastogenic response and IFN-gamma production.\r"

Thirty-nine patients aged from 18 to 65 years with a burn or fractures of more than two long bones were studied. Energy requirements were given parenterally as fat and glucose in isocaloric amounts. The patients were randomized into five groups receiving different amounts of nitrogen from zero to 0.3 g kg body-weight-1 24 h-1. Daily and cumulative nitrogen balance, urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion and nitrogen retention were calculated on days 2-8 after trauma. With no nitrogen, the mean(s.e.m.) daily nitrogen balance after the trauma was -13.8(0.5) gN. The balance improved markedly in groups with a nitrogen intake of up to 0.2 g kg body-weight-1 (P less than 0.001) compared with the no-nitrogen group. The 3-methylhistidine excretion increased because of the trauma in all groups with no statistically significant difference between the groups. Nitrogen retention decreased with increase in nitrogen supply and with time after injury. It is suggested that a nitrogen supply of 0.20 kg bodyweight-1 24 h-1 is optimal for severely injured patients during the first week after trauma.\r"

These tumors contrasted with typical encapsulated papillary cystic neoplasms that show extrapancreatic growth and that are detected as a palpable abdominal mass in young women. These four tumors, although unpalpable, were all detected by nodular images of calcification in abdominal plain radiography. The tumors had a mean diameter of 3.1 cm (range, 1.7 to 4.5 cm), were confined within the pancreatic parenchyma, and showed central fibrosis accompanied by dystrophic changes such as calcification and ossification. A small necrotic cyst contiguous to the fibrous focus also was observed in the tumor in three patients. Tumor cells similar to those of a papillary cystic neoplasm had infiltrated among the pancreatic parenchyma in solid and pseudopapillary patterns, and pleomorphic atypism was observed in some parts of the tumor in three patients. These tumors were tentatively designated solid, infiltrating variety of papillary cystic neoplasms to differentiate them from ordinary encapsulated papillary cystic neoplasms. Although no signs of recurrence have been noticed after surgical treatment in these patients, the infiltrating growth pattern and the presence of pleomorphic atypism suggest higher malignancy than the ordinary papillary cystic neoplasm. The contrasting growth pattern and possible malignancy may warrant establishment of these tumors as a papillary cystic neoplasm subclass.\r"

Patients were divided into a smoking group (n = 20) and a non-smoking group (n = 25) based on current smoking habits up until the time of surgery. The two groups were similar with respect to sex, ASA physical status, surgical procedure, duration of anaesthesia, narcotic and anaesthetic use and recovery characteristics. The non-smoking group was, however, significantly (P less than 0.05) older than the smoking group. Postoperative oxygen saturation (SaO2) decreased (P less than 0.001) during transport of both groups of patients from the Operating Room to the Recovery Room; a decrease which was significantly greater in the smoking group. The severity of hypoxaemia was also significantly greater in the smoking group than in the non-smoking group. This study suggests that cigarette smoking contributes to postoperative arterial oxygen desaturation following general anaesthesia and that supplemental oxygen should be administered to these patients during postoperative transport.\r"
