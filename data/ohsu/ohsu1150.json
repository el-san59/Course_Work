Comparative analysis of phospholipids revealed a reduced content in the EMB-resistant strain, particularly in the cell membrane fraction. Significant alterations were observed in the individual phospholipid content and phospholipid fatty acyl group composition of whole cells and subcellular fractions. Quantitative changes were seen in the chemical constituents of the cell walls of resistant cultures in comparison with those of EMB-susceptible cultures of M. tuberculosis. Alterations in the binding of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate to whole cells of an EMB-resistant strain indicated structural changes on the cell surface. Structural changes in the cell wall may play an important role in the resistance of M. tuberculosis H37Ra to EMB.\r"

The proton gradient and membrane potential were determined from the distribution of [2-14C]dimethadione and rubidium-86, respectively. delta mu H was reduced from 124 to 3 mV in EDTA-valinomycin-treated cells at 22 degrees C with 150 mM KCl and 0.1 mM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. During the collapse of delta mu H, macrolide uptake increased. Erythromycin efflux studies strongly suggested that this increase was not due to an energy-dependent efflux pump but was likely due to increased outer membrane permeability. These data indicated that macrolide entry was not a delta mu H-driven active transport process but rather a passive diffusion process.\r"

E. faecalis V583, E. faecium AIB-42, and E. faecalis AIB-41 showed moderately high-level resistance (MIC, 128 to 256 micrograms/ml) that was detected by dilution methods but not by disk diffusion unless prolonged incubation or an inoculum 10-fold greater than the standard was used. Similarly, this level of resistance was detected by AMS Vitek only when an inoculum 10-fold larger than recommended was used. The high resistance demonstrated by E. faecium AIB-40 (MIC, 2,048 micrograms/ml) was readily detected by all methods studied. Variation in the ability of different methods to detect vancomycin resistance among enterococci complicates monitoring the incidence of these organisms and could result in very major susceptibility reporting errors.\r"

Enteral feeding disposables were not prescribable by general practitioners, and funding for the equipment was inadequate in the hospital and community. The mean time to arrange funding for equipment was eight months (range two weeks to two years). Parental views on home enteral nutrition were positive and none felt that its disadvantages outweighed the benefits. Altogether 35 children were described as being more happy and active.

Endogenous prostaglandin E2 levels and ex vivo production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) were measured in synovial fluid samples obtained at baseline and 1 week later. We measured peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) degranulation following surface-bound IgG stimulation, a possible 5-lipoxygenase product-mediated event, by determining lactoferrin and elastase release into the culture fluid. We found decreased levels of endogenous prostaglandin E2 as measured by radioimmunoassay, and decreased ex vivo production of LTB4 by PMN as measured by high performance liquid chromatography, in synovial fluid samples from patients who took tenidap. Release of the granule proteins lactoferrin and elastase was decreased in PMN obtained from patients receiving tenidap, as well as in the PMN incubated in vitro with tenidap. Improvement in clinical measures paralleled the biochemical changes. The unique 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory property of tenidap, as measured by LTB4 production and degranulation, suggests that it may have clinical activity which differentiates it from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of concomitant intravenous (IV) heparin (200 U/kg bolus, followed by 100 U/kg/h) on the efficacy of arterial and venous thrombolysis with IV recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA; 0.5 mg/kg over 1 hour) was investigated in a combined femoral arterial and venous thrombosis model in the dog. The arterial model consisted of a high-grade stenosis, endothelial damage, and a thrombotic occlusion, and the venous model consisted of a 125I-fibrin-labeled blood clot. After a dose-finding pilot study in four dogs, a randomized, prospective, and blind study was performed in 20 animals pretreated with 2.8 mg/kg IV acetyl salicylic acid (ASA). The combination of rt-PA and heparin (group I, n = 10) induced early (less than 30 minutes) arterial reperfusion in seven dogs, late (greater than 30 minutes) reflow in two dogs, and persistent occlusion in one dog. rt-PA alone (group II, n = 10) was associated with early reperfusion in one dog, late reflow in three dogs, and persistent occlusion in six dogs (P = .018). Reocclusion occurred in five of nine reperfused dogs of group I and in one of four reperfused dogs of group II (P = not significant). Venous clot lysis amounted to 81% +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) for group I and to 49% +/- 7% for group II (P less than .001). Template bleeding times increased moderately, but significantly, in group I (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 minutes at baseline to 7.0 +/- 1.4 minutes at 30 minutes, P = .006), but only marginally in group II (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 minutes to 3.6 +/- 0.7 minutes, P = .09). No systemic fibrinogen depletion was observed. Thus, the concommitant use of heparin with rt-PA accelerates arterial reperfusion and enhances venous thrombolysis in dogs pretreated with ASA. These results, obtained in a randomized prospective study design, add to a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence, indicating that thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA requires concomitant adjunctive IV heparin for optimal efficacy, even in the face of treatment with ASA.\r"

  ".W": "The translocated c-myc oncogene in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and murine plasmacytoma (MPC) has been proposed to be expressed at a stage of differentiation at which the gene is normally silent, resulting in a continuous proliferation and an inhibited terminal differentiation. To determine whether c-myc is differently expressed at the various stages of the differentiation pathway, we used B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, representing resting B lymphocytes, inducible to proliferation and/or differentiation in vitro. The c-myc protein, and Ig lambda-light chain and PCA-1 antigen as markers of B-cell maturation, were analyzed in single, morphologically defined cells by immunocytochemical double-staining. The proliferation of individual cells was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation and by analysis of Ki-67 antigen expression. The results show that the level of c-myc expression correlates to the stage of differentiation and to the proliferative activity. Uninduced resting cells did not express c-myc. The c-myc protein was observed in the highest amount at the proliferative B-lymphoblast stage of maturation and was reduced in plasmablasts and undetectable in plasma cells. The results suggest that maturation of B cells into nonproliferative, terminally differentiated plasma cells is associated with a downregulated c-myc expression and thus support the view that the deregulated c-myc gene in BL and MPC is expressed at an inappropriate stage of maturation and thereby inhibits terminal differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently described a reproducible method whereby colonies containing cells that secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) can be grown from normal, human, adult bone marrow samples. The present report characterizes the cells that initiate these colonies. It is shown that all clonogenic cells express the CD19 surface antigen, as removal of these cells before plating in the B-cell colony assay abolished the subsequent growth of plaque-forming, B-lineage colonies. Cells from both the CD10+ and CD20+ B-lineage subpopulations initiated the growth of B-cell colonies, as removal of either subset resulted in a 50% reduction in the number of resulting B-cell colonies. The removal of activated B cells (CD23+), plasma cells (PCA-1+), or myeloid cells (CD13+) did not lead to a significant depletion in B-cell colony formation. Pre-B cells that were not yet committed to Ig light chain expression were also able to differentiate and proliferate into Ig-secreting colonies under the culture conditions used. Colonies initiated by these light chain uncommitted cells were distinguished using a replicate protein immunoblotting technique, which detects the simultaneous secretion of Ig kappa and Ig lambda from single colonies. These experiments provide evidence that the CD10 antigen is expressed on B-lineage cells before Ig light chain commitment, whereas CD20 is not. In conclusion, this B-cell colony assay provides a system for studying the differentiation of bone marrow-derived B cells and their precursors into Ig-secreting cells.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether early effects of zidovudine treatment on CD4+ lymphocyte count and concentrations of beta 2 microglobulin, neopterin, or HIV p24 antigen or antibody are correlated with survival in patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. DESIGN--Retrospective study of changes in laboratory markers and survival. SETTING--Multicentre trial at university hospital clinics. SUBJECTS--90 Patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. INTERVENTION--Patients started zidovudine 200 mg orally every four hours. Fifty six of the patients died a median 17 months after starting zidovudine; the remaining 34 patients were followed up for a median 25.5 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in CD4+ lymphocyte count and serum concentrations of p24 antigen and antibody, beta 2 microglobulin, and neopterin; survival of the patient. RESULTS--The pretreatment characteristics that independently predicted poor survival were determined using a multivariate proportional hazards model: a diagnosis of AIDS (v AIDS related complex), age over 45 years, and the logarithm of serum neopterin concentration. When these baseline characteristics were controlled for the logarithm of CD4+ lymphocyte count at weeks 8-12 of treatment (p = 0.007) and an increase in serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration at weeks 8-12 (p = 0.05) also independently correlated with survival. In the 38 patients with a better pretreatment prognosis, 24 month survival estimated by the product-limit method was 88% for those with a good response on both surrogate markers during early treatment compared with only 50% for those with a poor response on either marker. In the 38 with a worse pretreatment prognosis, 24 month survival was estimated to be 49% for those with a good response on both surrogate markers compared with only 18% for those with a poor response on either. CONCLUSION--These data suggest that CD4+ lymphocyte count at 8-12 weeks and, perhaps, change in serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration could be surrogate end points for clinical outcome in trials of antiretroviral drugs for patients with HIV disease.\r"

Our clinical and laboratory findings do not differ from those reported in the literature for MP infection with no exanthem or for SJS of various etiologies. Eighty percent of the children presented with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, headache), with a mean of 10 days (range 1 to 30) before skin rash broke out. Skin manifestations occurred in 94.2% of the patients after 3 to 21 days (mean 10.3 days) of fever. The exanthem, composed predominantly of maculopapular and vesicular, was distributed chiefly on the trunk and extremities and lasted less than 14 days in 87.8% of the patients. Stomatitis was observed in 91.6% of the patients and conjunctivitis in 50%. No consistent pattern seems to emerge by which one could predict the existence of MP infection causing SJS. The complications of SJS associated with MP seem less frequent (2.7%) and much less severe than in cases where SJS arises from other reported causes. Because coincidence cannot be excluded from the assessments of the degree and rate of improvement for the few patients treated with corticosteroid, from the low frequency of complications, and from the mortality rate of zero in this series of patients, the use of corticosteroids for SJS associated with MP infection is questionable.\r"

  ".W": "Reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance by a high inspired oxygen concentration is a common, but not universal phenomenon in patients with pulmonary vascular disease of varying etiology that may determine their response to long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy. We therefore determined changes in PVR during oxygen therapy in two patient populations not previously studied: systemic sclerosis (n = 8, mean age +/- SEM, 44.5 +/- 5.4 years) and primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 7, mean age +/- SEM 38 +/- 7.8 years). All patients were hypoxemic (arterial oxygen tension, on air 9.5 +/- 1.2 kPa for SSc and 8.3 +/- 0.6 kPa for PPH, p greater than 0.05). Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, systemic arterial pressure, PaO2 and cardiac output by thermodilution were measured at three, 20-min intervals while inspiring air and again after inspiring 60 percent oxygen for 30 min. The PVR fell significantly with oxygen in patients with SSc from 797.6 +/- 179.2 to 610 +/- 151.6 dynes/s/cm-5 (p less than 0.01), and this fall correlated with baseline PAP and PaO2 prior to oxygen therapy (r = 0.86, p less than 0.025; r = 0.77, p less than 0.05, respectively). In patients with PPH, there was no significant fall in PVR with oxygen (from 969 +/- 80.2 to 851.9 +/- 91.2 dynes/s/cm-5, p greater than 0.05) and no predictor of a vasodilator response in individual patients. In SSc, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction contributes more consistently to elevated PVR than in patients with PPH.\r"

We examined nine patients with COPD who performed a SST on four separate days within a ten-day period. The patients walked on a treadmill for 6 min. At the end of each minute, patients matched a Borg rating to the intensity of their breathlessness. We measured the HR, VE, VO2, VT and f at the end of each minute. While the mean VO2, VE, HR, VT and f stabilized after one or two attempts, the Borg ratings decreased with successive tests. We conclude that the Borg scale for measuring breathlessness shows progressive decreases with repetition whereas VO2, VE, HR, VT and f stabilize after one or two practice attempts. This suggests that desensitization to dyspnea may play a role in the improvement of patients after exercise.\r"

In 14 patients Neisseria meningitidis and in 31 Chlamydia spp were considered the main etiologic agent. Compared with a control group of 45 healthy men, the ADA activity in patients with pneumonia was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in all patient groups except those with meningococcal pneumonia. The highest ADA levels were seen in patients with pneumonia caused by M pneumoniae (27.4 +/- 9.7 U/L), Chlamydia spp (26.3 +/- 9.1 U/L), and adenovirus (28.5 +/- 10.9 U/L) compared with the controls (11.1 +/- 3.0 U/L). In patients with meningococcal pneumonia, the ADA activity was significantly decreased (p less than 0.001). Serum ADA activity probably reflects differences in cellular immune response to different infectious agents. The ADA determinations may give corroborative information on the etiologic agent of pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this work is to present 640 patient-years of experience using the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator (IAPV) in a regimen of noninvasive ventilatory support for patients with paralytic/restrictive respiratory insufficiency. Fifty-two of the 54 patients who used the IAPV used 24-hour noninvasive ventilatory support. Thirty-eight of the 52 patients could tolerate less than 15 minutes of free time off their ventilators except by the successful use of glossopharyngeal breathing (GPB). No patient, however, retained an indwelling tracheostomy and none required or used supplemental oxygen therapy. Forty-eight of the 54 patients used the IAPV for daytime support for a mean of 12.9 +/- 11.5 years (3 months to 39 years) while using other forms of noninvasive support overnight. All 48 patients maintained normal minute ventilation and end-tidal PCO2 on the IAPV. One patient used the IAPV only for nocturnal ventilatory support for six months. Five patients relied on the IAPV as their sole method of ventilatory support 24 hours a day for a mean of 13.4 +/- 11.2 years (range, 2 to 31 years). Three of these five patients had no free time and were studied by nocturnal SaO2 monitoring that demonstrated a mean SaO2 of 95 percent or greater and a minimum SaO2 of 86 percent. The maximum end-tidal PCO2 was 49 mm Hg during sleep on the IAPV. The 48 patients receiving daytime IAPV support reported few difficulties. However, two of the five patients using the IAPV 24 hours a day had development of sacral decubiti. The IAPV became ineffective for 12 patients after 12.3 +/- 9.5 years of use. These patients then switched to daytime mouth IPPV. We conclude that the IAPV is a safe and effective method of long-term daytime ventilatory support for patients with paralytic/restrictive respiratory insufficiency. Its use is optimized when employed in combination with other noninvasive methods of ventilatory support, thus eliminating the need for tracheostomy, and optimizing the use of GPB. Regular follow-up is important because the IAPV can become less effective with time.\r"

Six of the patients with COPD and the patient with hypothyroidism responded to positive pressure ventilation by mask with improvements in blood gas values and clinical status. The remaining two patients with COPD and the two patients with OHS were unable to use the system. Four of the patients with COPD and chronic respiratory failure have been subsequently maintained on daily volume ventilation via nasal mask for about 20 months with persistent clinical and physiologic improvements. Application of volume ventilation through the nasal CPAP mask is a feasible strategy for providing long-term mechanical ventilation to selected patients with COPD and respiratory failure.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated effects of duodenojejunal (DJ) feeding on gastric pH and selected gastrointestinal hormones in 13 randomly selected patients in an intensive care unit (ICU). To obtain baseline values for gastric pH, a nasogastric (NG) tube was placed in each patient and gastric pH was measured every 30 minutes for 2 hours. To obtain control values, a Dobbhoff tube was placed fluoroscopically and 0.45 percent saline solution (NaCl), 75 ml, was infused for 1 hour and gastric pH was measured again; the previously placed NG tube was left in position. Then, by randomization, either 0.45 percent NaCl (pH = 5) was continued (n = 6) or a high-nitrogen, isotonic, enteral feeding solution (Osmolite HN, pH = 6.4) (n = 7) was infused, both at 75 ml/h. Gastric pH was noted hourly for 96 hours; antacid (Maalox TC, 15-ml aliquots) was given by NG tube when the pH was 4 or less. After 96 hours, the infusion was stopped and gastric pH was noted for 4 additional hours. Before and during initial saline solution infusion; after 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours of continuous infusion; and 4 hours after stopping the infusion, peripheral venous blood was obtained for measurement of plasma gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and serum gastrin. Data were analyzed by ANOVA (RMD), Fishers' exact test, and the unpaired t-test. Groups did not differ demographically. Throughout the infusion, gastric pH tended to be higher with the enteral feeding solution than with saline solution, but this was significant only at 24 hours. Less antacid was required with the enteral feeding solution at 24 and 48 hours than with saline solution. Plasma GIP levels were significantly higher with the enteral feeding solution than with saline solution during most of the infusion. Serum gastrin levels did not differ between the groups. In this cohort, infusion of the enteral feeding solution tended to maintain a gastric pH of more than 4 and was associated with increased plasma GIP levels, which may inhibit gastric acid secretion. Early enteral feeding may benefit certain ICU patients.\r"

Qc underestimated (p less than 0.001) cardiac output calculated from intermittent CO-oximeter measurements (6.2 vs 6.4 L/min) with good correlation (r = .96), while it consistently overestimated (p less than 0.05) thermodilution cardiac output (Qtd) (6.2 vs 5.9 L/min, r = .84). Measured oxygen consumption correlated with Qtd (r = .78) nearly as well as did Qc, while mixed venous oxygen saturation correlated poorly with Qtd (r = -.10). Trends of multiple Fick variables were helpful in interpreting changes in a single parameter. We conclude that continual trending of Fick variables in critically ill patients is both feasible and useful and that Qc agrees well with both traditional Fick cardiac output computed from CO-oximetry data and thermodilution measurements. Finally, measured oxygen consumption, available continuously, correlates well with changes in cardiac output in this subset of critically-ill patients.\r"

Emboli increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and decreased CO from 2.7 to 1.8 L/min-1. Following embolization, dogs were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 received .5 mg/kg of rtPA over 30 minutes. Group 2 received the same dose of rtPA and were pretreated with hydralazine to increase CO approximately 50 percent. In the group 3 dogs, CO was increased by opening a systemic A-V fistula. Following embolization, CO remained low in group 1, the mean 2 h time-averaged CO was 1.9 L/min-1. The CO was 2.9 and 3.1 L/min-1 in groups 2 and 3, respectively. Corresponding to the increased flow in groups 2 and 3, rate and extent of pulmonary thrombolysis significantly increased. These results indicate that an increase in CO augments rtPA-induced pulmonary thrombolysis.\r"

Analysis of serum bilirubin by diazoreactive methods showed serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin as high as 445 mumol/L that were not affected by phenobarbital administration. However, analysis of serum bile pigments by high-pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated marked decrease of unconjugated bilirubin after phenobarbital treatment (from 432.4 mumol/L to 291.0 mumol/L) associated with slight increase of bilirubin monoconjugates and disconjugates (from 0.25 mumol/L to 0.42 mumol/L). Furthermore, in the past few years the patient had exhibited striking skin hyperextensibility and diaphragm eventration. This case confirms that alkaline methanolysis-high-pressure liquid chromatography is the most reliable method for assessment of serum fraction bilirubin levels; that clinical parameters such as neurological signs do not unequivocally discriminate between type I and II Crigler-Najjar disease and that response to phenobarbital treatment remains the main diagnostic tool.\r"

  ".W": "Chlorpromazine (10 mumol/L) causes a marked increase in portal pressure in perfused rat liver. Simultaneously, oxygen consumption, hepatic clearance of taurocholate and bile flow are diminished. These effects are prevented by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (15 mumol/L), acetylsalicylate (3 mmol/L) or ibuprofen (200 mumol/L). On addition of chlorpromazine the liver releases increased amounts of prostaglandin D2; this increase does not occur in the presence of indomethacin. At higher concentrations of chlorpromazine (100 mumol/L) the inhibition of taurocholate clearance and bile flow is accompanied by only a moderate increase of portal pressure, and indomethacin is without effect. At this high concentration, substantial cell damage, as indicated by the release of lactate dehydrogenase, is present. We conclude that arachidonic acid-derived metabolites, notably prostanoids, are involved in the inhibition of bile flow and of taurocholate clearance observed at low concentrations of chlorpromazine. The data suggest that changes in the microcirculation are responsible for the impairment of the liver functions. At higher concentrations of chlorpromazine the cell toxicity of the drug becomes prominent.\r"

No class II antigens were detected by immunoperoxidase staining of the normal biliary epithelial cells, but alloactivated lymphocyte culture supernatants were able to induce class II expression. The activity of the supernatants was blocked with an anti-gamma-interferon monoclonal antibody. In addition, recombinant human gamma-interferon alone induced the expression of class II antigens and increased the intensity of class I staining of cultured biliary epithelial cells. Biliary epithelial cell-induced proliferation of alloreactive T lymphocytes demonstrated that the major histocompatibility complex molecules carry functional lymphocyte-activating determinants. The recognition of major histocompatibility complex determinants was confirmed by monoclonal antibody-blocking studies and by stimulation of an alloreactive T-cell clone. However, the biliary epithelial cells were much less potent stimulators than arterial endothelial cells tested in the same assay system.\r"

Interferon-positive cells were regularly seen in the infiltrating mononuclear cells, and the number showed a good correlation with the degree of the necroinflammatory activity of the disease. In chronic persistent hepatitis and in normal livers, they were infrequent or virtually absent. alpha-Interferon was shown to be positive in lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fibroblasts, Kupffer cells and, weakly, in the cytoplasm of a few hepatocytes in cases of active hepatitis, whereas gamma-interferon was demonstrated only in lymphocytes. The expression of human leukocyte class I antigens on hepatocytes showed a close association with the number of interferon-producing cells, but not with the presence of virus particles and HBcAg in liver cells, when studied using electron microscopy and double-labeling. Interferon seems to be an important regulator of the local immune response in the liver in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Its functions may play a role in inducing the human leukocyte class I antigen expression on hepatocytes, thus enhancing the elimination of virus-containing hepatocytes by major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic lymphocytes.\r"

We studied the efficacy of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon in the treatment of this disease in comparison with a control group. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Ten patients received 7.5 MU alpha-interferon/m2 body surface three times weekly for 3 mo, then 5 MU/m2 for 3 mo and 2.5 MU/m2 for 6 mo. Ten patients were treated with gamma-interferon at a dose of 2 MU/m2 for 6 mo and the other 10 served as controls without treatment. The mean serum ALT levels and liver histological findings improved significantly only in the patients treated with alpha-interferon. No changes were observed in patients treated with gamma-interferon or in controls. Five of 10 patients treated with alpha-interferon had complete responses (mean ALT normal during therapy). After treatment ALT returned to pretreatment levels in two of 5 patients. The long-term response rate after alpha-interferon therapy was 30% at 18 mo. We conclude that alpha-interferon is effective in controlling disease activity in a portion of patients with chronic hepatitis C. High doses of alpha-interferon do not appear to add further benefit in the response rate or relapse rate. gamma-Interferon therapy is ineffective.\r"

  ".W": "The symposium participants concluded that vaccines with even moderate efficacy can be highly useful to prevent large numbers of severe illness episodes and deaths and that the decision of whether to initiate a vaccine program should be based on measures or estimates of public health effectiveness rather than only on protective efficacy. Studies of protective efficacy are of course critical to establish the vaccine's biologic activity, but additional aspects of public health effectiveness are also crucial in making these decisions. First-generation vaccines are available against typhoid, cholera, and soon rotavirus diarrhea, and vaccines against enterotoxigenic E. coli diarrhea and shigellosis are under development. The problems related to enteric diseases are enormous; the vaccines may soon be produced at low cost and promise to be relatively more easy to distribute than most previous vaccines. The number of illnesses and deaths averted from vaccine programs are potentially great. Pilot programs using the new vaccines should urgently be considered in areas where the disease burden is high, and steps should be taken to monitor effectiveness of the intervention in these programs. Such studies of vaccine effectiveness and costs in a \"real world\" situation are an essential step of the research process and should be used to guide the organization of larger-scale programs. Finally, many of the necessary research and development activities relevant to public health vaccinology must address country-specific problems. Developing countries should consider the role of vaccine-related research among the priorities for their essential national health research and build the necessary capabilities in applied and basic medical sciences and in the social sciences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Macrophages incubated with native rickettsiae, but not those incubated with hemolytically inactivated rickettsiae, secreted significantly more LTB4 than did sham-treated macrophages. Antirickettsial antiserum was opsonic and blocked hemolysis, and macrophages incubated with rickettsiae in the presence of antiserum did not secrete more LTB4 than those incubated with buffer alone. Native rickettsiae also stimulated alveolar macrophages to secrete LTB4 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), but inactivated rickettsiae had no effect. Finally, because trifluoperazine did not alter macrophage LTB4 secretion in the presence of rickettsiae, but inhibited PGE2 secretion, it was suggested that the mechanisms by which rickettsiae stimulated production of these autacoids may have differed.\r"

The bactericidal effect of serum was partly removed by bentonite, Seitz-filtration, and addition of FeCl3, suggesting it is mediated by lysozyme and beta-lysin. Partly purified human beta-lysin plus purified human lysozyme or either protein plus ampicillin were bactericidal for L. monocytogenes. Hen egg white lysozyme was not active. Lysozyme and beta-lysin were not synergistic with tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or chloramphenicol. Thus, lysozyme and beta-lysin may play a role in the natural resistance to L. monocytogenes, and these serum proteins could contribute to the effectiveness of ampicillin in vivo.\r"

When P. carinii were separated from rat cells by a semipermeable membrane, alveolar macrophages secreted substances lethal to P. carinii only when the macrophages were activated by interferon-gamma; normal macrophages were ineffective. Type II alveolar epithelial cells caused death of P. carinii whether or not interferon-gamma was present. The effects of soluble mediators also were tested; recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) but not recombinant rat interferon-gamma or endotoxin was directly lethal to P. carinii. These lethal effects were prevented when antiserum to TNF or antioxidants (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were included. These data suggest that TNF may be a major mediator involved in the killing activity of activated macrophages against P. carinii and that TNF's activity against P. carinii is related to induction of oxidative stresses.\r"

To document the presumed role of endogenous IFN-gamma and IL-2 in responsiveness to antileishmanial chemotherapy in the T cell-intact host, L. donovani-infected euthymic BALB/c mice were treated with anti-IFN-gamma or anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) before and after Sb administration. Treatment with MAbs exacerbated visceral infection but did not inhibit the in vivo efficacy of Sb. Thus, while combination therapy of Sb plus IFN-gamma or IL-2 may prove beneficial in T cell-deficient hosts with visceral leishmaniasis, T cell activities other than or in addition to IFN-gamma or IL-2 production may mediate in vivo responsiveness to antileishmanial chemotherapy in the euthymic host.\r"

ELISA detected antibodies in sera from 20 of these patients and also from another 25 patients. Patients with antibodies detected by either conventional or ELISA procedures were significantly more likely to have abnormal chest radiographs, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates, or absent upper respiratory symptoms than were other patients. Circulating antigen was found in sera from 35 patients, 33 of whom had no detectable anticoccidioidal antibodies at that time. Detectable antigen was noted frequently in sera obtained within the first month after the onset of symptoms and was infrequently detected later when more patients exhibited antibodies.

Four out of the five species (P. aeruginosa being the exception) presented a species-specific, drug-independent, rhythmic variation of their level of susceptibility to several antibiotics over the time of the study. The species-specific rhythmic responses were further characterized by spectral analysis, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. Through this analysis it was possible to rank the species according to their main period of oscillation. The longest period of oscillation was detected for S. aureus (38 months). K. pneumoniae and E. coli presented intermediate values (25 and 23 months respectively), and P. mirabilis the shortest period of oscillation (11 months). Species displaying long periods of oscillation tended to present very low levels of susceptibility, while species displaying short periods of oscillation usually presented the highest levels of susceptibility observed. Although some hospital environmental factors, such as drug consumption, were also analyzed, no correlation was found between them and the in vitro bacterial cyclic responses to antibiotics.\r"

When used for secondary prevention, 20 mg/d of lovastatin was estimated to save lives and save costs in younger men with cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L) and to have a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio regardless of the cholesterol level except in young women with cholesterol levels below 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L). Doses of 40 mg/d of lovastatin had favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in men with cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L). By comparison, primary prevention had favorable cost-effectiveness ratios only in selected subgroups based on cholesterol levels and other established risk factors. We conclude that current national recommendations regarding medication for secondary prevention are not as aggressive as our projections would suggest, while recommendations regarding the use of medications for primary prevention should consider the cost of medication as well as the risk factor profile of the individual patient.\r"

The leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (LAM-1) regulates the migration of human leukocytes by mediating the binding both of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules of peripheral lymph nodes and of neutrophils to endothelium at inflammatory sites. As lymphocytes and neutrophils express the same LAM-1 protein, it is not clear how lineage-specific differences in leukocyte migration are controlled. We now report that the affinity of LAM-1 for a carbohydrate-based ligand, PPME, is dramatically increased following lymphocyte and neutrophil activation by lineage-specific stimuli. In addition, activation of lymphocytes by physiological stimuli enhanced LAM-1-dependent binding to high endothelial venules. Thus, transient changes in LAM-1 affinity after leukocyte stimulation probably directly influence leukocyte migration.\r"

However, fluorescent indicator dyes have been available only for simple inorganic ions such as Ca2+, H+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Cl-. We now report a fluorescent indicator for the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signalling pathway. The sensor consists of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in which the catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits are each labelled with a different fluorescent dye such as fluorescein or rhodamine capable of fluorescence resonance energy transfer in the holoenzyme complex R2C2. When cAMP molecules bind to the R subunits, the C subunits dissociate, thereby eliminating energy transfer. The change in shape of the fluorescence emission spectrum allows cAMP concentrations and the activation of the kinase to be nondestructively visualized in single living cells microinjected with the labelled holoenzyme.\r"

During development, expression of the synapsins correlates temporally with synapse formation, but there has been no direct evidence that they are involved in synaptogenesis. Here we report that overexpression of synapsin IIb in the neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid clonal cell line NG108-15 leads, during cell differentiation, to marked increases in the number of neuritic varicosities and in the numbers of small clear vesicles and large dense core vesicles per varicosity, as well as to the appearance of synapse-like cell-cell contacts. Thus, synapsin IIb may be involved in the regulation of synapse formation and, as a result, in long-term neuronal signalling.\r"

Though K+ channels differ widely in regulation and kinetics, physiological studies have suggested a common structure: a single file pore containing multiple ion-binding sites and having broader vestibules at both ends. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and single-channel recordings to identify a molecular region that influences ionic selectivity in a cloned A-type K+ channel from Drosophila. Single amino-acid substitutions in H5, the fifth hydrophobic region, enhanced the passage of NH4+ and Rb+, ions with diameters larger than K+, without compromising the ability of the channel to exclude the smaller cation, Na+. The mutations that substantially altered selectivity had little effect on the gating properties of the channel. We conclude that the H5 region is likely to line the pore of the K+ channel.\r"

  ".W": "A locus segregating with familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been mapped to chromosome 21, close to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. Recombinants between the APP gene and the AD locus have been reported which seemed to exclude it as the site of the mutation causing familial AD. But recent genetic analysis of a large number of AD families has demonstrated that the disease is heterogeneous. Families with late-onset AD do not show linkage to chromosome 21 markers. Some families with early-onset AD show linkage to chromosome 21 markers, but some do not. This has led to the suggestion that there is non-allelic genetic heterogeneity even within early onset familial AD. To avoid the problems that heterogeneity poses for genetic analysis, we have examined the cosegregation of AD and markers along the long arm of chromosome 21 in a single family with AD confirmed by autopsy. Here we demonstrate that in this kindred, which shows linkage to chromosome 21 markers, there is a point mutation in the APP gene. This mutation causes an amino-acid substitution (Val----Ile) close to the carboxy terminus of the beta-amyloid peptide. Screening other cases of familial AD revealed a second unrelated family in which this variant occurs. This suggests that some cases of AD could be caused by mutations in the APP gene.\r"

We have investigated the molecular basis for the role of PTPase activity in Yersinia pathogenesis. Allelic recombination was employed to introduce a defined mutation into the yopH plasmid gene. Conversion of the essential Cys-403 to Ala in the catalytic domain of the protein abolished YopH PTPase activity and significantly reduced the virulence of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in a murine infection model. 32P-labeled phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were immunoprecipitated from extracts of Y. pseudotuberculosis-infected cell monolayers and analyzed by SDS/PAGE to assess the impact of YopH on host protein phosphorylation. Major proteins of 200, 120, and 60 kDa were dephosphorylated in macrophages associated with wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis. Selective removal of phosphate from the 120- and 60-kDa proteins was shown to be specific to the YopH PTPase activity. Phagocytosis of the bacteria was not required for this dephosphorylation activity, suggesting that YopH is functionally expressed by extracellular bacteria. These observations indicate that the essential function of YopH in Yersinia pathogenesis is host-protein dephosphorylation.\r"

  ".W": "One approach to gene therapy for hepatic diseases is to remove hepatocytes from an affected individual, genetically alter them in vitro, and reimplant them into a receptive locus. Although returning hepatocytes to the liver itself would be advantageous, the feasibility of this approach has never been evaluated due to the inability to distinguish donor from host hepatocytes. To unambiguously identify transplanted hepatocytes after transplantation, and to better quantitate their number and degree of liver function, two transgenic mouse lines were generated in a C57BL/6 background. The first expresses the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene from the relatively liver-specific human alpha 1-antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter and allows transgenic hepatocytes to be readily identified after 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactoside staining; the second produces the hAAT protein under control of the same promoter, which enables hepatocyte survival and maintenance of liver function to be quantitated by measuring the serum levels of hAAT. Hepatocytes isolated from transgenic donors were transplanted into nontransgenic C57BL/6 recipients by intrasplenic injection. Surprisingly, a large fraction of these cells were identified within the liver parenchyma but not the spleen at 2 months after transplantation. The high levels of serum hAAT detected in transplant recipients were stable for greater than 6 months, suggesting that established cells will survive indefinitely. These results have important implications for liver organogenesis and hepatic gene therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91142146\r", 
  ".W": "The majority of interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptors in human fibroblasts has been shown to be localized at focal adhesions. This study describes rapid alterations caused by IL-1 beta/IL-1-receptor interaction at these sites. Fibroblast monolayers, incubated with IL-1 beta and prepared for electron microscopy, showed successive loss of cell-substratum contact and fewer and less-pronounced processes. Immunocytochemistry revealed loss and redistribution of the talin staining initially observed after 5-15 min of IL-1 beta incubation. Similarly, the cytoskeleton showed a decrease in staining and a disorganization starting from 15 to 30 min after IL-1 addition, whereas extracellular fibronectin appeared largely unaffected. Prelabeling with [32P]phosphate showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in the level of talin phosphorylation, peaking at 15 min. Phospho amino acid analyses revealed a higher level of serine and threonine phosphorylation. The data suggest that the action of IL-1 beta on fibroblasts may be partially mediated by direct phosphorylation of talin via activation of a protein serine/threonine kinase, leading to changes in transmembrane linkage proteins and the cytoskeleton. Such alterations at focal adhesions may provide a mechanism by which IL-1 can rapidly modulate cell-matrix interactions during inflammation and wound healing.\r"

  ".U": "91142150\r", 
  ".W": "According to the current model for mutagenic bypass of UV-induced lesions, efficient bypass requires three proteins: activated RecA (RecA*) and either activated UmuD (UmuD') and UmuC or their plasmid-encoded analogues, MucA' and MucB. RecA* aids synthesis of UmuD' and UmuC (and MucA'/MucB) at two levels: by inactivation of the LexA transcriptional repressor of these genes and by cleavage of UmuD (and MucA) to produce the active fragments, UmuD' (MucA'). A third role for RecA is revealed when these two roles are otherwise satisfied in a suitably engineered strain. An often-suggested possible role for RecA in bypass is inhibition of editing by the epsilon subunit of DNA polymerase III. Here, by demonstrating that elimination of epsilon by deletion of its gene, dnaQ, does not relieve the requirement for the third function of RecA, we show that RecA must perform some function other than, or in addition to, inhibition of epsilon. We also show that elimination of epsilon does not relieve the requirement for either Muc protein. Moreover, we observed reactivation of irradiated phi X174 in unirradiated cells expressing MucA' and MucB. This finding makes it unlikely that the additional role of recA involves derepression of an unidentified gene or cleavage of an unidentified protein and makes it more likely that RecA participates directly in bypass.\r"

In the present studies, anti-Reo3R antibodies are shown to stimulate additional features of the program of oligodendrocyte development, including the loss of the A2B5 marker and expression of myelin basic protein. In anti-Reo3R antibody-treated cultures, galactocerebroside was expressed by cells having the morphology of immature oligodendrocyte precursors. Reo3R binding did not appear directly to inhibit or stimulate proliferation of glial progenitor cells or to affect their lineage commitment. Cell-surface structures utilized as a receptor by reovirus type 3 appear to play a role in the regulation of the initiation or rate of execution of the oligodendrocyte developmental program.\r"

In neuronal systems, Fos has been proposed to couple synaptic transmission to changes in gene expression by acting in the cell nucleus in concert with other proteins to form complexes in the promoter regions of target genes. We report here that the acute administration of a single dose of the indirect-acting dopaminergic agonist cocaine increases multiple Fos proteins in rat caudate nucleus. The increase is dose-dependent and is apparent immunocytochemically at 1 hr, maximal at 2 hr, and absent 48 hr after treatment. The increase seen immunocytochemically is composed of several molecular weight species as assessed by Western blotting of proteins from isolated striatal cell nuclei. Administration of the specific dopaminergic receptor antagonists sulpiride and SCH-23390 prior to cocaine support a significant role for D1 but not for D2 receptors in mediating this effect. These data indicate that D1 dopamine receptors are linked to a cellular immediate-early gene system(s) and suggest an action of cocaine at one or more levels of gene expression via modulation of transcriptional processes in activated cells.\r"

  ".W": "Two layers (3 and 6) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (GLd) of the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) receive projections from the superficial layers of the superior colliculus. The goal of this study was to determine whether the same or different cells in the superior colliculus give rise to the projections to layers 3 and 6 by following individual axons labeled with biocytin from the superior colliculus to the GLd. The results show that the terminal fields differ in the two layers--those in layer 3 are restricted to a line of projection, whereas those in layer 6 are elongated along the dimension orthogonal to a line of projection. Another important difference between axons that project to GLd layers 3 and 6 is that those that project to layer 6 give off collaterals to the posterior pretectal nucleus, whereas at least some axons that project to layer 3 send a collateral to the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (GLv). These results suggest that the superior colliculus exerts separate influences on these two GLd layers, both of which project to separate targets above layer IV in the striate cortex. The biocytin method has proved useful by showing the dendritic trees of the superior colliculus cells of origin, the pathways taken by the axons (including the presence of collaterals), and the terminal fields both within and outside the GLd.\r"

Site-saturation mutagenesis has been used to alter two copper-binding residues of azurin (Met-121 and His-46) and Met-92 of plastocyanin. While the plastocyanin mutants do not appear to bind copper, the azurin variants all bind copper and show characteristic type I blue copper centers. In particular, the electronic spectra reflect the dominance of the charge transfer interaction between copper and the thiolate of Cys-112, being relatively insensitive to changes in Met-121 or His-46. In contrast, removal of Met-121 appreciably alters the EPR spectra of the mutants, although, to a first order, the spectra of all mutants are themselves similar, suggesting a more distorted geometry around copper in the mutants than in the wild type.\r"

  ".W": "In individuals with Alzheimer disease and in aged nonhuman primates, deposits of amyloid occur in senile plaques in brain parenchyma and in the walls of some meningeal and cortical vessels. Amyloid is primarily composed of beta/A4, a 4-kDa peptide derived from the transmembrane form of an amyloid precursor protein (APP). We examined the distribution of beta/A4 and APP (outside the beta/A4 domain) in cerebral cortices of monkeys ranging in age from 4 to 41 years. In all animals, APP immunoreactivity was present in cell bodies, proximal dendrites, and axons of cortical neurons. In aged animals, all of which showed senile plaques, large APP-positive axons were conspicuous, and APP immunoreactivity was present in neurites around beta/A4-immunoreactive plaques. In some plaques, APP-immunoreactive elements were located in proximity to deposits of beta/A4. The presence of APP immunoreactivity in neuronal perikarya, dendrites, axons, and in neurites within beta/A4-containing plaques supports the hypothesis that neurons can serve as one source of amyloid deposited in brain parenchyma.\r"

The largest and best-studied MODY pedigree is the RW family. The majority of the diabetic subjects in this pedigree has a reduced and delayed insulin-secretory response to glucose, and it has been proposed that this abnormal response is the manifestation of the basic genetic defect that leads to diabetes. Using DNA from members of the RW family, we tested more than 75 DNA markers for linkage with MODY. A DNA polymorphism in the adenosine deaminase gene (ADA) on the long arm of chromosome 20 was found to cosegregate with MODY. The maximum logarithm of odds (lod score) for linkage between MODY and ADA was 5.25 at a recombination fraction of 0.00. These results indicate that the odds are greater than 178,000:1 that the gene responsible for MODY in this family is tightly linked to the ADA gene on chromosome 20q.\r"

The addition of inducer to the cell culture medium provided permissive conditions for isolation of a conditional-lethal mutant virus. Under nonpermissive conditions, the isolated virus did not form plaques, and the yield was decreased by at least 1000-fold under one-step growth conditions. Transcription of the operator-controlled gene was inducer-dependent and necessary for synthesis of the 11-kDa protein. Application of this mutagenesis strategy to other viruses is discussed.\r"

Studies of blood, bone marrow, spleen, and thymus reveal that platelets are the only circulating blood cells and megakaryocytes are the only hematopoietic precursor cells that possess the prokaryotic enzyme. The lack of transgene expression in brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, and skeletal muscle was established by in situ staining of tissue sections as well as kinetic assay of tissue homogenates. These data suggest that this domain of the PF4 promoter contains most, if not all, of the tissue-specific region of the gene. Unexpectedly, the adrenal gland exhibits approximately 2% of the levels of beta-galactosidase possessed by megakaryocytes and the distribution of the prokaryotic enzyme corresponds to the location of mineralocorticoid-secreting cells. This result implies that either the PF4 gene is transcribed at low levels in specialized adrenal cells or that these specialized endocrine cells possess trans-acting factors similar to those that control the megakaryocyte promoter. The selective high-level expression of transgenes linked to the PF4 promoter should allow us to augment or suppress the in vivo levels of critical components in megakaryocytes and platelets and subsequently ascertain the effects of these modifications.\r"

The need to implement strategies specific to serving the diversity of services required by homeless people has been apparent. To devise appropriate strategies, clinical information was drawn from the Health Resources and Services Administration-Health Care for the Homeless (HRSA-HCH) projects, which were created in 1987 primarily to fill such a need. In addition, data gathered by the HCH projects (1984-87) funded by the Robert Wood Johnson and Pew Memorial Trust were used. It is suggested that the past mode of providing health care for the homeless has been found to be inadequate when confronting the complex problems of the homeless person of today. In general, health care providers need to focus more on case management activities, which may include activities not necessarily associated with the provision of health care services (for example, finding and providing food, clothing, shelter, and assessing entitlement eligibility) to achieve the ultimate goal--stabilization--and when possible, reintegration of the homeless person back into society.\r"

And primary care and clinical preventive services should receive as much national attention as acute care and long-term care. The public health system at the Federal, State, and local levels with its mandate to assure conditions in which people can be healthy must also be incorporated into the national debate. Publicly funded infrastructures for delivering primary health care have become a significant element of assuring access at the community level. This paper examines the expanding role of public health in assuring access to the delivery of primary health care and clinical preventive services to vulnerable populations within the larger issue of who should have access to care and how it should be made available. Special attention is paid to the part played by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the Public Health Service, which, in the Federal fiscal year that began on October 1, 1989, administered some $1.8 billion worth of programs for health care of targeted populations and for the support of training in the health professions.\r"

  ".W": "The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), on April 26, 1986, was the first major nuclear power plant accident that resulted in a large-scale fire and subsequent explosions, immediate and delayed deaths of plant operators and emergency service workers, and the radioactive contamination of a significant land area. The release of radioactive material, over a 10-day period, resulted in millions of Soviets, and other Europeans, being exposed to measurable levels of radioactive fallout. Because of the effects of wind and rain, the radioactive nuclide fallout distribution patterns are not well defined, though they appear to be focused in three contiguous Soviet Republics: the Ukrainian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR, and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Further, because of the many radioactive nuclides (krypton, xenon, cesium, iodine, strontium, plutonium) released by the prolonged fires at Chernobyl, the long-term medical, psychological, social, and economic effects will require careful and prolonged study. Specifically, studies on the medical (leukemia, cancers, thyroid disease) and psychological (reactive depressions, post-traumatic stress disorders, family disorganization) consequences of continued low dose radiation exposure in the affected villages and towns need to be conducted so that a coherent, comprehensive, community-oriented plan may evolve that will not cause those already affected any additional harm and confusion.\r"

  ".W": "Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet were compared in Tianjin province, People's Republic of China; in North Karelia Province, Finland; and in the United States as a whole. People in Tianjin received 7 percent of their energy intake from saturated fats, whereas people in the United States received 13 percent and those in North Karelia received 20. The mean blood cholesterol levels for men were 158 milligrams per deciliter (mg per dl) for Tianjin, 216 mg per dl for the United States, and 241 mg per dl for North Karelia. The smoking prevalence among men was highest in Tianjin (66 percent), followed by the United States (42 percent) and Finland (36 percent). The differences among mortality rates for the three locales were less pronounced among women than among men. Age-standardized total mortality for women was highest for Tianjin and lowest in North Karelia. The reverse was true for men. Age-standardized total mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin and highest in North Karelia. Age-standardized ischemic heart disease mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin (99 per 100,000) and highest in North Karelia (730 per 100,000). For women, the corresponding figures were 83 per 100,000 in Tianjin and 164 per 100,000 in North Karelia. Although salt intake was higher in Tianjin than in North Karelia, the blood pressure was on average lower in persons from Tianjin than in those from North Karelia. The stroke mortality rate in Tianjin, however, was much higher than in either Finland or the United States.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91142359\r", 
  ".W": "Access to obstetrical services has deteriorated in recent years, as large numbers of physicians have discontinued or restricted obstetrical practice. In Washington State, one response to this access crisis has been the establishment of the Access to Maternity Care Committee (AMCC), an ad hoc group composed primarily of private sector obstetrical providers and representatives of State government responsible for the delivery of health care to women and children. The major objectives of the AMCC is to improve access to obstetrical services for socially vulnerable women, both rural inhabitants and the medically indigent. The committee has been successful in serving as a forum in which to resolve many of the administrative problems that have arisen between private sector obstetrical providers and the State's Medicaid Program, the major source of payment for the one-third of pregnant women who are medically indigent. Building upon the trust that the committee members developed in working together, the AMCC served as a major force in persuading the State legislature to expand substantially its investment in perinatal care by increasing Medicaid eligibility, raising provider reimbursement, and improving social service for pregnant women. Such ad hoc coalitions between the private and public sector may be quite effective in addressing obstetrical access problems in other States.\r"

  ".W": "The Missouri birth certificate has had a question, \"cigarettes smoked per day?\" since 1978; the current data base contains more than 800,000 records. A comparison of the Missouri data for married mothers with the National Natality Survey (NNS) data shows mainly consistent findings between the two data sets. The Missouri data, however, also provided information on the smoking status during pregnancy of unmarried women that is not available from the NNS. The Missouri data show a substantial difference in the smoking rates of married (23.2 percent) and unmarried (40.9 percent) women. The highest smoking rates during pregnancy are found among unmarried women, ages 20-24, with less than a high-school education, and those with a fourth or higher order child. There has been a relatively small overall drop in the smoking rate from 1978-80 to 1986-88 (31.1 percent versus 27.5 percent). However, blacks and teenagers have had very substantial drops in smoking rates. There has been only a slight decrease for other high-risk groups such as white unmarried women, women with less than a high-school education, and those having a fourth or higher order birth. Missouri started using the new national standard birth certificate in 1989 with a differently worded smoking question. The percentage of women smoking and those smoking less than one pack per day in 1989 went down more than would be expected from the trend data. It appears that the new birth certificate question will provide a lower estimate of the percentage of mothers who smoke cigarettes than was acquired from the previous version on the Missouri certificate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study is based on cocaine-related episodes seen at 453 consistently reporting hospital emergency rooms located primarily in 21 U.S. metropolitan areas. Cocaine-related medical emergencies reported to DAWN increased from 16,033 in the first half of 1987 to 25,607 in the first half of 1989; they decreased to 22,796 in the second half of 1989. In the Boston, Buffalo, Dallas, Detroit, Minneapolis, New York, Newark, Phoenix, and Washington, DC, areas cocaine-related ER episodes decreased for at least the last two consecutive semiannual periods. Consistent with the prevalence of crack, smoking was the most frequently reported route of administering cocaine. Patients who had smoked the drug generally were younger and less likely to use other drugs in combination than were those who took cocaine by other routes. The proportion of black patients increased from 57 to 63 percent in cocaine-related ER episodes overall, and from 74 to 77 percent in episodes where the drug was smoked. Heroin used in combination with cocaine was reported in 12 to 15 percent of cocaine episodes, and both drugs were injected in 75 to 78 percent of the cases where both were involved, suggesting so-called speedballing. Patients who combined heroin with cocaine were generally older than patients in cocaine episodes overall.\r"

Being older and rarely migrating back to Cuba, Cuban Americans present a good subject for comparative cancer mortality. Age-adjusted death rates for selected causes of cancer are compared in this paper for Cubans in Cuba, the Cuban-born in the United States, and all whites in the United States. Two forms of cancer have been of particular concern in Cuba, cancer of the lung and cancer of the prostate, because of their relatively high death rates. The age-adjusted death rates for both of these cancers are lower among the Cuban-born in the United States than they are among Cubans in Cuba and whites in the United States. Death rates for cancer of the cervix and cancer of the rectum among the Cuban-born in this country are also low relative to Cubans in Cuba and whites in the United States. Stomach cancer mortality among Cuban-born men in the United States is lower than for men in Cuba or for white men in the United States, but Cuban-born women in this country have rates that are slightly higher than those of U.S white women. Mortality rates from colon cancer in both sexes and breast cancer among women are intermediate between the lower rates in Cuba and the higher rates among U.S. whites. Finally, the Cuban-born in the United States have higher death rates from cancer of the liver than do Cubans in Cuba or whites in the United States.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A system that encompasses documentation of program activities, interviews with women in waiting rooms of primary care providers, semiannual interviews with a panel of approximately 100 women from the target population, and telephone followup with participants in direct education workshops was designed and implemented. Through October 1990, more than 2,100 interviews had been conducted. Data from these activities have facilitated continued development and refinement of educational materials, provided guidance for developing new strategies for reaching the target population, and provided continuous feedback to program managers to allow monitoring the impact of all program activities.\r"

The demographic characteristics, drug use behavior, and sexual practices of i.v. drug users who developed AIDS were prospectively studied at the Montefiore Medical Center from October 1984 to February 1988. The early wave of i.v. drug users with AIDS was characterized by poverty, minority overrepresentation (more than 80 percent were black or Hispanic), and initiation of i.v. drug use at an early age (median age 19 years). Injection of drugs and sharing of needles was frequent. Most had used so-called shooting galleries, but only for a minority of injection episodes. Heroin or cocaine use was almost universal, nearly always accompanied by abuse of another substance, usually alcohol or marijuana. Fewer than a third had ever participated in a methadone maintenance program, but more than 40 percent had been in prison since 1978. All patients had been sexually active, often with partners who were not i.v. drug users. The research suggests a complex interaction existing between high-risk demographic characteristics, drug use practice, and certain types of sexual behavior, all of which contributed to the early spread of HIV infection in this population. Efforts that are directed toward interrupting i.v. drug user-related transmission of HIV need to include consideration of these characteristics.\r"

An interest in experimenting with new forms of health care delivery as well as enabling State legislation has contributed to an expanded role for nonphysician providers. Together with nurse practitioners, PAs comprise 20 percent of the primary care staff and write 25 percent of the prescriptions for the membership. The use of PAs in managed health care settings will likely increase to meet growing primary care demands. Analysts have found the cost of a PA ranges from 25 percent to 53 percent of the cost of a physician. PAs are capable of providing care for 86 percent of the diagnoses seen in outpatient primary care setting, and patient acceptance is high.\r"

Matching (linking) of infant deaths to birth certificates from 1975 to 1988 indicates that infants born Indian had a 28 percent chance of being misclassified as another race (usually white) on the death certificate. Infants born white or black had less than a 1 percent chance of being misclassified. Misclassification of Indian deaths strongly alters the overall IMR for the Oklahoma Indian population from the currently reported 5.8 per 1,000 (1987-88) to an estimated actual rate of 10.4 per 1,000 for the same period.\r"

The assay employs four recombinant viral antigens, corresponding to HIV-1 p24, p31, p41 and gp120 proteins, in an immunoblot format. With this assay, HIV-1 antigen reactivity was detected in all 683 infected patient serum or plasma specimens evaluated; 665 (97.6%) of these sera met the criteria for a positive interpretation, and 18 (2.6%) were classified as indeterminate. All 683 samples reacted with the recombinant gp41-equivalent protein. The first sequential enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-reactive samples collected from 33 seroconverting homosexual men reacted on RIBA-HIV216. Eleven (1.1%) of 999 EIA-negative blood donor sera reacted weakly with a single recombinant antigen (p24 or p31), whereas 13 to 48 percent had indeterminate reactions on viral lysate Western blots. One (1.5%) of 66 EIA-positive, Western blot-negative blood donor samples and 19 (29%) of 66 EIA-positive, Western blot-indeterminate blood donor samples scored indeterminate on RIBA-HIV216. Nonspecific reactivity was seen with only 1 (0.8%) of 114 patient sera containing possible interfering antibodies, whereas 33 percent of these samples had indeterminate reactions on Western blot and 35 percent had equivocal reactions on immunofluorescence assay (IFA). We conclude that the RIBA-HIV216 is approximately as sensitive as and significantly more specific than virus-derived Western blot and IFA. The RIBA-HIV216 also allows for semiquantitation of specific antibodies that may be of value in clinical staging and therapeutic monitoring.\r"

Most studies have evaluated the sensitivity of various screening or confirmatory procedures used in establishing the diagnosis of LA. The authors have focused on the variables involved in the mixing studies used to identify the presence of a circulating inhibitor. To detect the latter, attention to the ratio of patient plasma to normal plasma is important, particularly in the case of a minimally prolonged APTT. Also the source of \"normal\" plasma must be platelet poor to maximize sensitivity in the case of a weak LA.\r"

There was no evidence of physical abuse in any of these of patients; indeed, evidence against abuse was fairly good. Nonetheless, physical abuse was alleged by the patients' families in four of the cases. Long bone fracture in the absence of trauma in patients after prolonged bed rest has been well described in the radiologic and orthopedic literature, but not previously in geriatrics. It is important that this phenomenon be recognized, lest all unexplained fractures in nursing home patients automatically be taken as evidence of abuse or neglect.\r"

Genomic DNAs were isolated from schistosomes from infected patients (some of whom did not respond to antischistosomal chemotherapy), and from snails from disparate geographic locations in Brazil. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were evident in Southern blot hybridizations of these schistosome DNAs, and the RFLPs indicated that the genomic profiles of a number of Brazilian strains were more similar to each other than they were to parasites from two laboratory reference strains of Puerto Rican origin. In addition, the Brazilian isolates could generally be separated from each other based on these RFLPs. Isolates from the southeastern state of Minas Gerais were more similar to each other than they were to parasites isolated in the northeastern states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. Variation was evident among individual worms from some of the isolates, and these individual variations contributed to the complex RFLP patterns that were characteristic for particular isolates. The variation within a natural population isolated directly from snails at Ressaca, Belo Horizonte, may be more marked than that exhibited by more established strains maintained in the laboratory for numerous generations.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective was to design a prototype tube-valve-mask ventilator that would permit relatively inexperienced operators to provide adequate emergency artificial ventilation, namely, adequate ventilatory volumes and a high oxygen and low carbon dioxide delivery. DESIGN: The tube-valve-mask ventilator is powered by the exhaled air of the operator and uses a tube to act as an oxygen reservoir (1,300 mL) that is filled between breaths. Mouth-to-mouth breathing was the standard against which the tube-valve-mask ventilator and the other accepted methods of mouth-to-mask and bag-valve-mask were assessed. SETTING: Comparison studies were conducted during simulated two-person CPR using a training mannikin equipped to measure ventilation volume and delivered oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen volunteer first-year nursing students were used as operators. INTERVENTIONS: The order in which the pairs of operators performed each of the techniques was randomized. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The ventilation volume and the percentage of oxygen and carbon dioxide delivered by each technique were as follows (mean +/- SD): Mouth-to mouth (760 +/- 290 mL, 17 +/- 1% O2, 3.4 +/- 0.4% CO2), mouth-to-mask (910 +/- 350 mL, 41 +/- 8% O2, 2.5 +/- 0.4% CO2), bag-valve-(soft) mask (550 +/- 230 mL, 94 +/- 3% O2, 0.03 +/- 0.02% CO2), bag-valve-(rigid) mask (560 +/- 300 mL, 96 +/- 3% O2, 0.03 +/- 0.02% CO2), and tube-valve-mask (860 +/- 290 mL, 91 +/- 7% O2, 0.2 +/- 0.2% CO2). CONCLUSION: In the hands of relatively inexperienced operators, mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-mask, and tube-valve-mask techniques provide adequate ventilation volumes to a mannikin. This was not the case with the bag-valve-mask systems (800 mL; P = .05 by t test). Of the systems that provide adequate ventilation volume, the tube-valve-mask appears, superior in that higher oxygen and lower carbon dioxide concentrations can also be obtained (P = .05 by paired t test).\r"

DESIGN: Two hundred fifty prospective emergency intubations. SETTING: Emergency intubations performed in the emergency department, helicopter, and prehospital ground environment. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Intubations were performed by emergency medicine residents, paramedics, and flight nurses. INTERVENTIONS: The FEF CO2 detector was applied after 250 emergency intubations. Notation of color change indicating intratracheal placement was recorded in each case. Confirmation of refutation of the detector's results was determined subsequently through traditional methods. RESULTS: The sensitivity for confirmation of endotracheal intubation in the 137 patients with a palpable pulse was 100%. However, only 76 of 103 patients (sensitivity, 72%) in cardiac arrest had endotracheal intubation confirmed by color change. The device was uniformly specific for tracheal intubation in 73 arrested patients in whom a color change was noted (100%). There was one instance (of a total of seven misintubations) in which a positive color change was noted, but the tube was not intratracheal (specificity, 86%). Overall sensitivity for tracheal intubation was 88% (95% confidence limits; range, 0.83 to 0.92), and specificity for tracheal intubation was 92% (95% confidence limits; range, 0.62 to 0.99). CONCLUSION: The FEF colorimetric detector reliably detects intratracheal placement in the nonarrested patient. Its use in prolonged cardiac arrest merits further study.\r"

DESIGN: The FEF indicates the presence of CO2 by the color change of a chemically treated indicator; the TRIMED uses infrared technology. Both devices were used during 60 intubations. SETTING: Intubations during in-hospital emergency situations outside of the operating room were studied. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients undergoing intubation for respiratory failure, CPR, and other airway protection situations were enrolled in the study. INTERVENTIONS: The TRIMED monitor and FEF detector were placed in series between the manual resuscitator and the patient's endotracheal tube adapter after endotracheal tube placement. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We defined the acceptable criterion for detection of CO2 as production of a positive signal within six manual resuscitator bag breaths. The TRIMED met this criterion in 58 of 60 patients (sensitivity, 0.97) and the FEF met this criterion in 59 of 60 patients (sensitivity, 0.98). A paired t test showed no statistically significant difference in performance between the two devices. In five of nine cases of intubation during CPR, the color change of the FEF was described as \"subtle.\" In one CPR case, a positive signal was not obtained by either device. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the performance of the FEF CO2 detector is equal to that of the TRIMED monitor for verification of endotracheal intubation in nonCPR situations. Interpretation of FEF color changes during CPR should be approached with caution until further studies using the FEF during CPR are completed.\r"

Individual T cells were directly cloned from the cerebrospinal fluid and blood before in vitro expansion, and their clonotypes were compared by Southern blot analysis of the rearrangement patterns of their T-cell receptor beta chain and gamma chain genes. This allowed the determination of whether two T cell clones shared the same T-cell receptor and thus arose from identical, clonally expanded (oligoclonal) progenitor T cells. As an extension of previous studies, oligoclonal T-cell clones were identified in both cerebrospinal fluid and blood populations in 5 of 9 patients with inflammatory demyelinating disease among a total of 486 blood and cerebrospinal fluid T-cell clones. In contrast, no clonally expanded T-cell populations were found among a total of 424 clones derived from either blood of 4 normal control subjects or blood and cerebrospinal fluid of 8 patients with other neurological diseases. Analysis of T-cell receptor V beta genes among 4 oligoclonal T-cell populations derived from 3 patients with multiple sclerosis demonstrated common usage of the V beta 12 gene segment. These data suggest that oligoclonal T cells share similar specificities and that clonal expansion may have resulted from specific stimulation by an antigen. Moreover, identical clones between blood and cerebrospinal fluid were observed in 3 of 9 patients with demyelinating disease, thus providing further evidence of an equilibrium between peripheral and central nervous system immune compartments.\r"

During the experimental period, epileptic rats exhibited synchronous spike-and-wave discharges recorded from the cerebral cortex, whereas the electroencephalographic pattern of control animals was normal. An overall consistent increase in local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose was observed in epileptic rats as compared to nonepileptic control rats. This increase was statistically significant in 52 of the 59 cerebral structures studied and concerned all cerebral functional systems. These results are in accordance with positron emission tomography measurements in humans with typical childhood absence epilepsy. There is a lack of anatomical correlation between areas demonstrating hypermetabolism and areas where spike-and-wave discharges are recorded. Thus, the diffuse increase in cerebral energy metabolism in epileptic rats as compared to controls is not directly related to the occurrence of spike and wave discharges.\r"

Doppler indices of flow velocity from the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries were measured immediately before, and at postprandial time intervals up to 60 minutes after, a first feed of 1 ml of milk given through a nasogastric tube. There were no significant differences between the preprandial and postprandial values of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, and pH. The median peak systolic velocity (PSV) (55.9 cm/sec) and time average mean velocity (TAV) (10.6 cm/sec) before the feed at the superior mesenteric artery rose progressively and significantly to postprandial peaks of 88.5 cm/sec and 20.5 cm/sec at 45 minutes, respectively. Significant postprandial rises in the median PSV and TAV values at the coeliac artery were also observed, with a peak at 45 minutes. There were no significant correlations between blood flow velocity indices (preprandial or postprandial) and gestational age, postnatal age, conceptional age, or birth weight. We conclude that the first exposure of preterm babies to a small volume of milk feed is associated with postprandial changes in blood flow velocity consistent with an increase in blood flow in the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries, although the mechanism of this response is uncertain.\r"

Phenylalanine concentrations were within the reference range in the group receiving Vaminolact, and were significantly lower than in the group receiving Vamin glucose.

Using this staining technique intravascular lipid can be shown relatively often, although only in patients who have received intravenous lipid emulsion.

Atrial natriuretic factor concentrations rose significantly between the first and second sample times as did the urine output and output:input ratio. By the time that the third sample was taken, atrial natriuretic factor concentration had decreased significantly since the second sample had been taken, while urine flow was maintained. All subjects initiated a spontaneous diuresis that was related to the second concentration of atrial natriuretic factor. With partial correlation analysis a significant relationship was shown between the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor and the maintenance of urine output throughout the study period. Individual hormone concentrations did not, however, correlate with simultaneous renal variables. Changes in the concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor coincided with initiation of spontaneous diuresis in babies with respiratory distress syndrome, and may have a role in the complex mechanisms that maintain this diuresis.\r"

Most women, however, face this crisis and master it without developing major psychiatric disorders or severe sexual dysfunction. The options of breast conservation and reconstruction give women a new sense of control over their treatment and are quite successful in helping women feel comfortable with their bodies again. The effectiveness of breast conservation and reconstruction in preventing or ameliorating sexual problems after breast cancer diagnosis is less clear, however. Any impact these options have on sexuality is subtle and may relate more to a woman's feelings of being desirable than to how often she has sex, her lovemaking practices, or how much she enjoys sex. We need more information on how chemotherapy and hormonal therapy affect women's sex lives. As clinicians, we should pay more attention to our patients' complaints of vaginal pain, dryness, and overall loss of sexual desire during systemic treatment. Practical advice on lovemaking techniques and a clinician's open attitude towards discussing sexual issues can prevent a great deal of anxiety and sadness as women with breast cancer search for ways to keep their sex lives satisfying.\r"

  ".W": "The circadian and chronological changes in inhibin secretion were studied in normal adult men. To determine the diurnal release of inhibin, blood samples were collected every hour for 24 h from five healthy young adult men, and serum inhibin was measured by RIA. During the evening and the night, serum inhibin concentrations were relatively low; the lowest value was observed at 2200 h. At 0700 h, inhibin started to increase, reached a peak at 0900 h, and then gradually decreased. These results suggest that inhibin secretion is circadian. Testosterone and cortisol also showed circadian rhythms. In some of the five volunteers, the serum concentrations of inhibin, testosterone, and cortisol were superimposable, but no significant relationship was observed between the serum inhibin and FSH concentrations. With regard to the age-related changes in basal inhibin levels, the highest values were observed in the twenties, and lower values were found with aging. This relationship suggests that increased FSH in elderly men might be due to the reduced amount of peripheral inhibin.\r"

  ".U": "91147540\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the acute effects of sinorphan, an inhibitor of enkephalinase, on plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and urinary sodium excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites. A single oral dose of sinorphan (100 or 30 mg in 11 and 5 patients, respectively) was administered against placebo according to a double blind cross-over protocol. Basal plasma ANF levels varied over a large range between 2.6-79 pmol/L. Sinorphan, at a dose of 100 mg, inhibited 70% of plasma enkephalinase activity 60 min after ingestion and elicited simultaneously an increase in plasma ANF and cGMP levels 1.8 and 1.5 times basal values, respectively. There was a transient increase in sodium urinary output without a change in creatinine clearance over the initial 2-h period following drug administration. An increase in urinary cGMP was also observed on a longer period of 6 h. Plasma aldosterone decreased significantly, but the lowest concentration was reached 1 h later than the peak of plasma ANF. Mean blood pressure and PRA were unmodified. The effects of 30 mg sinorphan on plasma ANF, cGMP, and aldosterone were also significant, but less marked than those of the higher dose. Therefore, enkephalinase inhibition transiently increases sodium urinary excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites via a mechanism that is likely to imply reduction of ANF catabolism. These results suggest that ANF could play a role in the control of sodium homeostasis in liver cirrhosis with ascites.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the changes in serum immunoreactive inhibin (INH) in the first 2 yr of life, blood samples were obtained from 46 boys (age range, 61-659 days) and 37 girls (76-666 days) undergoing minor surgery for nonendocrine related conditions. Serum levels were compared with those of simultaneously measured FSH, LH, and either testosterone (T) or estradiol (E2). In the boys, the levels of all 4 hormones fell progressively with age up to about 300 days, with a minor fall only in the second year. FSH (0.7-1.4 IU/L) was initially at the lower adult male limit, while LH (3.2-5.0 IU/L) was at the midrange. T levels (2.2-3.3 nmol/L) were in the adult female range, while INH (200-820 U/L) was in the midrange for men. In the youngest girls, FSH levels (12-26 IU/L) were frequently above the upper limit of normal for the adult follicular phase, but fell to approximately 2.0 IU/L after 300 days. LH levels (0.5-3.5 IU/L) were at the lower adult normal limit and changed little with age, while E2 levels in the youngest girls (280-550 pmol/L) were in the midfollicular range, but were generally less than 10 pM at more than 200 days. INH levels (175-260 U/L) were in the low adult range initially, but the majority were undetectable over 200 days. In the boys, significant negative correlations were observed for all 4 hormones with age, while FSH, LH, and T were positively correlated with INH. In the girls, there were weaker negative correlations of the 4 hormones with age, but no significant correlations between the gonadotropins and INH. E2 was strongly correlated with INH. Thus, the previously described early postnatal activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis involves INH as well as the se steroids and gonadotropins. FSH levels in young girls were strikingly high, and INH levels were much higher in boys than girls. The low INH levels in girls may contribute to the elevated FSH seen during the period of neonatal gonadal activation.\r"

Of 35 women with recurrent fetal loss, seven were positive for lupus anticoagulant and six had increased IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, while of 31 women with only one or two episodes of fetal loss, one had lupus anticoagulant and none increased IgG anticardiolipin antibodies. These findings were significantly different. There was no difference in the incidence of increased IgM anticardiolipin antibodies between the two groups (three and two cases, respectively). A further 11 women with intrauterine death in the third trimester were studied and lupus anticoagulant and raised IgM anticardiolipin antibodies were found in one case. No woman was known to have systemic lupus erythematosus. It is concluded that lupus anticoagulant and increased IgG anticardiolipin antibodies are independently associated with recurrent first and second trimester fetal loss and that such cases should be investigated, even in the presence of otherwise good health, by a comprehensive methodological approach.\r"

When compared with the bacterial culture method both machines gave identical results with a negative predictive value of 0.99, while when compared with microscopy alone the Clinitek 200 and Rapimat II/T gave negative predictive values of 0.92 and 0.87, respectively.

The low-pressure receptors were stimulated and unloaded, respectively, by autotransfusion of blood (450 ml) and the application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP, -20 mmHg), and in 11 healthy men we measured MSA in the left peroneal nerve, indirect blood pressure, ECG, central venous pressure (CVP) and venous plasma concentrations of ANP and ADH (radioimmunoassay). Total MSA rose by 30% during LBNP and decreased during a rapid autotransfusion of blood, and the changes in MSA were significantly related to changes in CVP. The plasma concentrations of ADH and ANP were not significantly affected by either procedure. It is suggested that during moderate short-term changes in venous return, MSA responded more rapidly and/or at a lower threshold than the ADH and ANP systems.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia may play an important role in both the development of hypertension and its accompanying metabolic aberrations. In order to investigate this possibility, nine non-obese, non-diabetic, non-smoking, middle-aged men with untreated hypertension were treated with metformin 850 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks as a pilot study and within-patient comparison. Metformin decreased total and LDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.01), triglyceride (P less than 0.01), fasting plasma insulin (P less than 0.01) and C-peptide levels (P less than 0.02). Glucose disposal, an indicator of insulin action measured by means of the euglycaemic clamp technique, increased (P less than 0.001). Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity increased (P less than 0.02), and t-PA antigen decreased (P less than 0.01), whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and fibrinogen were unaffected by metformin treatment. Body weight remained unchanged. Withdrawal of metformin was associated with the return of both blood pressure and metabolism towards the initial levels. In conclusion, metformin treatment increased insulin action, lowered blood pressure, improved the metabolic risk factor profile and tended to increase the fibrinolytic activity in these mildly hypertensive subjects. These results support the view that insulin resistance plays a role in hypertension, and may open up a new field for the alleviation of abnormalities associated with cardiovascular disease.\r"

Serosal responses were inhibited by tetrodotoxin (TTX). A hydrophilic gold compound, sodium aurothiosulphate produced similar effects but only on serosal addition. Gold compounds can thus alter colonic transport activating enteric nerves and releasing a neurotransmitter. Thus gold induced diarrhea could have a significant neural component.\r"

Weekly random urinalysis, weekly psychotherapy, and quarterly self-report tests of pain, mood, and function were used to evaluate change. Three out of 4 patients remained in treatment for 19-21 months, stopped needle use, and/or markedly decreased substance abuse, and appear to have improved functionally. Surprisingly, all 3 patients had significant psychopathology requiring treatment with psychotropic medication. This treatment may warrant further research.\r"

Of these patients 8 had microscopic lymph node metastasis, 8 had seminal vesicle invasion without positive lymph nodes, 6 had positive surgical margins and 3 had only capsule penetration. Their only evidence of residual disease was detectable serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) by the Yang assay. A total of 15 patients (60%) had a subsequent decrease in PSA to less than 0.3 ng./ml. and an additional 5 (20%) had a decrease in PSA by more than 50%. Currently 8 patients have no detectable PSA after a median followup of 18 months (17 to 38 months) since initiating radiation therapy. Only 1 of 12 patients with detectable PSA immediately after radical prostatectomy has had a durable response to adjuvant radiation therapy. In contrast 7 of 13 patients with a delayed increase in PSA had a durable response. The ability of adjuvant radiation therapy to eliminate serum PSA in patients with a delayed increase in PSA after radical prostatectomy is encouraging. However, longer followup, including the use of nonradiated control subjects, is needed to assess the ability of adjuvant radiation therapy to control local disease and prolong patient survival.\r"

Cytotoxicity was evaluated by a colorimetric assay based on the capacity of viable cells to metabolize a tetrazolium dye, MTT, to produce a colored formazan product. The analyses of drug interactions were done by the isobolographic method (construction of isoeffect plots). The combination of doxorubicin and thiotepa was found to be the most synergistic, followed by the combination of doxorubicin and mitomycin-C. The combination of mitomycin C and thiotepa demonstrated an unpredictable effect. These findings suggest the combination of doxorubicin and thiotepa has potential advantage for chemotherapy of superficial bladder tumors.\r"

Endodontic reamers were contaminated with microorganisms, lased at various levels of energy, placed in Trypticase soy broth, incubated, and read for growth or no growth to determine sterility. Results indicated that the argon laser is capable of sterilizing selected dental instruments at the lowest energy level (1 watt for 120 seconds) of the three lasers tested. The other two lasers were able to sterilize the instruments also, but at higher energy levels. Results indicated all three lasers capable of sterilizing selected dental instruments; however, the argon laser was able to do so consistently at the lowest energy level of 1 watt for 120 seconds.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to determine what effect the degree of muscle glycogen depletion has on the rate of resynthesis, six male cyclists completed an exercise protocol that involved both one- and two-legged cycling. One leg completed 30 min of single-leg cycling, ten one-min sprints, and 30 min cycling with both legs. This resulted in a large degree of depletion (LD). The contralateral leg completed only 30 min of double-leg cycling and experienced a small amount of depletion (SD). Following the exercise, the subjects rested quietly for 6 h and were fed a 24% carbohydrate (CHO) solution every 20 min in order to achieve a CHO intake of 0.7 g.kg-1.h-1. Biopsies taken from the vastus lateralis muscle immediately after exercise revealed that the glycogen content of the LD leg decreased 93.9 (+/- 11.6) mmol.kg-1 w.w., whereas the SD leg used 49.3 (+/- 5.7) mmol.kg-1 w.w. (P less than 0.01). Subsequent biopsies taken at 2 and 6 h of recovery demonstrated that the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis was significantly greater in the LD leg, averaging 8.8 (+/- 2.4) mmol.kg-1.h1 w.w, while the SD leg restored glycogen at a rate of 3.0 (+/- 1.0) mmol.kg-1.h-1 w.w. (P less than 0.05). Glycogen synthase activity, expressed as its activity ratio (I/D), was also greater (P less than 0.01) in the LD leg both immediately after exercise (0.45 +/- 0.05 vs 0.24 +/- 0.04) and at 2 h of recovery (0.54 +/- 0.06 vs 0.27 +/- 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91148669\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial, designed to test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular ectopy after a myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of sudden death, patients in whom ventricular ectopy could be suppressed with encainide, flecainide, or moricizine were randomly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. The use of encainide and flecainide was discontinued because of excess mortality. We examined the mortality and morbidity after randomization to encainide or flecainide or their respective placebo. RESULTS. Of 1498 patients, 857 were assigned to receive encainide or its placebo (432 to active drug and 425 to placebo) and 641 were assigned to receive flecainide or its placebo (323 to active drug and 318 to placebo). After a mean follow-up of 10 months, 89 patients had died: 59 of arrhythmia (43 receiving drug vs. 16 receiving placebo; P = 0.0004), 22 of nonarrhythmic cardiac causes (17 receiving drug vs. 5 receiving placebo; P = 0.01), and 8 of noncardiac causes (3 receiving drug vs. 5 receiving placebo). Almost all cardiac deaths not due to arrhythmia were attributed to acute myocardial infarction with shock (11 patients receiving drug and 3 receiving placebo) or to chronic congestive heart failure (4 receiving drug and 2 receiving placebo). There were no differences between the patients receiving active drug and those receiving placebo in the incidence of nonlethal disqualifying ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, syncope, need for a permanent pacemaker, congestive heart failure, recurrent myocardial infarction, angina, or need for coronary-artery bypass grafting or angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS. There was an excess of deaths due to arrhythmia and deaths due to shock after acute recurrent myocardial infarction in patients treated with encainide or flecainide. Nonlethal events, however, were equally distributed between the active-drug and placebo groups. The mechanisms underlying the excess mortality during treatment with encainide or flecainide remain unknown.\r"

The severity of the dental changes did not correlate with the clinical or biochemical findings in all cases. These dental changes are seen only in MPS IV A (N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphate sulphatase deficiency) and are not found in MPS IV B (beta-galactosidase deficiency) or the recently delineated MPS IV C (enzyme defect unknown). The dental changes can aid in the diagnosis of patients affected by MPS IV A and are especially useful in mild atypical cases.\r"

The present study investigated the effect of active type 1 HSV (HSV-1) immunization on the development of oral cancer induced by HSV-1 and DMBA, alone or in combination, in the hamster buccal pouch. The results were similar to our previous report in that HSV-1 significantly enhanced the oncogenic effect of DMBA, and the numbers of pouches harboring tumor nodules and the numbers and sizes of tumors developed by topical DMBA were significantly increased by HSV-1 inoculation to the site of the DMBA application. Although HSV-1 immunization did not alter the carcinogenic activity of DMBA in animals receiving topical DMBA in combination with mock inoculation, it prevented the cocarcinogenic effect of HSV-1 in animals receiving topical DMBA in conjunction with HSV-1 inoculation. These data indicate that active HSV-1 immunization completely obstructs the co-oncogenic effect of HSV-1 in the oral cavity of hamsters.\r"

Performance was evaluated in a simple exercise in which ventilation was performed as a single isolated task. For each subject, this was compared to performance when a cognitive task involving clinical problem solving was simultaneously presented. Performance was expressed as frequency, tidal volume, and estimated hypothetical alveolar Pco2 in each resuscitation. A correlation was observed (P less than 0.05) between simple and complex resuscitation simulations for each measure of performance. The only subject with inadequate performance in the complex exercise was also identified as deficient in the simple exercise. These observations suggest that an adequate evaluation of performance of some resuscitation skills may be obtained in simple, efficient simulation exercises.\r"

The meta-analysis revealed a relative difference in infection rates of 43.7 percent in favor of the use of antibiotics versus placebo, of 8.3 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus a single antibiotic, of 13.7 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus cefazolin, and of 4.1 percent in favor of multiple-day prophylaxis versus single-day prophylaxis. This meta-analysis suggests that a 1-day course of clindamycin may be the most effective prophylactic antibiotic regimen for head and neck surgery.\r"

  ".U": "91149910\r", 
  ".W": "In 1921 it was discovered that the sexual fate of Drosophila is determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes. Only recently has it been found that the X chromosome to autosome (X:A) ratio is communicated in part by the dose of sisterless-b (sis-b), an X-linked genetic element located within the achaete-scute complex of genes involved in neurogenesis. In this report, the molecular nature of the primary sex determination signal and its relation to these proneural genes was determined by analysis of sis-b+ germline transformants. The sis-b+ function is confered by protein T4, a member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. Although T4 is shared by sis-b and scute-alpha, the regulatory regions of sis-b, which control T4 expression in sex determination, are both separable from and simpler than those of scute-alpha, which control T4 expression in neurogenesis. Dose-sensitive cooperative interactions in the assembly or binding of sis-dependent transcription factors may directly determine the activity of the female-specific promoter of Sex-lethal, the master regulator of sexual development. In this model there is no need to invoke the existence of analogous autosomal negative regulators of Sex-lethal.\r"

The mechanisms of signal transduction by calcitonin receptors were studied in a pig kidney cell line where the hormone was found to regulate sodium pumps. Calcitonin receptors activated the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or the protein kinase C (PKC) pathways. The two transduction pathways required guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) (the choleratoxin sensitive Gs and the pertussis toxin sensitive Gi, respectively) and led to opposite biological responses. Moreover, selective activation of one or the other pathway was cell cycle-dependent. Therefore, calcitonin may induce different biological responses in target cells depending on their positions in the cell cycle. Such a modulation of ligand-induced responses could be of importance in rapidly growing cell populations such as during embryogenesis, growth, and tumor formation.\r"

A prospective, serial, 2-dimensional echocardiographic study of patients with myocardial infarction who received recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was undertaken to address this issue. The study population comprised 52 of the 112 patients enrolled in the first Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction trial at Duke University Medical Center. Enrollment in the serial echocardiography protocol was determined by equipment and support staff availability. Complete echocardiographic studies were performed within 90 minutes after initiation of thrombolytic therapy (day 0), and on days 1, 3 and 6. Patients undergoing serial echocardiography did not differ in demographic or clinical characteristics from those who did not. Pericardial effusion was present in 3 of 38 patients (8%) at day 0, in 2 of 44 (5%) at day 1, in 8 of 43 (19%) at day 3, and in 10 of 42 (24%) at day 6. By day 6, 3 of 10 pericardial effusions were moderate in size, 1 of 10 was large and the remainder were small. No patients developed echocardiographic or hemodynamic signs of cardiac tamponade. The prevalence and time course of pericardial effusion among patients with acute myocardial infarction who received rt-PA in this study are similar to observations reported in earlier studies in which patients did not receive thrombolytic therapy. Adverse sequelae of pericardial effusion after thrombolytic therapy are rare.\r"

Three around-the-clock continuous intragastric pH-metries were carried out the day before beginning treatment, at the end of the nizatidine course, and 67 h after the last dose of the drug was given. Nizatidine produced mean pH values that were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than those of the pretreatment profile during both the whole 24-h period and the nighttime (2400-0759), and this confirms that it effectively inhibited gastric acidity. Conversely, there was no significant difference between the acidity indexes of pH profiles obtained before dosing and after discontinuing treatment in any of the time intervals considered. Therefore, it appears that a short term course of nizatidine therapy does not cause rebound hyperacidity in duodenal ulcer patients.\r"

Weight gain was observed in a similar percentage of patients, whereas serum albumin increase was significant only in group 3: 3.15 +/- 0.66 versus 3.54 +/- 0.61 g/100 ml (p less than 0.05). Mean activity index decreased significantly in all groups (p less than 0.001), and length of stay in hospital was similar. Patients with intestinal obstruction had a better immediate response when submitted to PN: clinical remission was achieved in 75% of those in group 3, but in only 50% in groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.05). Otherwise, short- and long-term outcome was similar.\r"

  ".W": "Although hepatocellular carcinoma is a relatively uncommon tumor in the United States, it is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East, where most cases are associated with infection with the hepatitis B virus. We have studied 99 American patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection and compared these findings to those in a group of matched controls with other cancers. The two groups differed in proportion, with hepatitis B surface antigen in serum being significantly higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (7% vs. 0%, p = 0.009). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was also found more frequently in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (13% vs. 2%, p = 0.002). The relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients was calculated to be 17.3 and for antibody to hepatitis C virus to be 7.3. The attributable fraction of cases related to the hepatitis B surface antigen carrier state was 6.7% and for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus was 11.4%. Approximately three quarters of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma did not have evidence of either hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus infection. These findings provide strong evidence that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the United States may even play a more important role than the hepatitis B virus.\r"

Most of the work on IgK genetics has been conducted using immunological techniques for allelic typing and sequence analysis. This is restricted by availability of reagents and can be both expensive and time-consuming. PCR primers were designed to amplify the kappa constant gene (Ck), and four allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASOs) were used to distinguish the alleles in the amplified PCR products. Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed to confirm that the primers specifically amplified the Ck region and the ASOs differentiated the Km alleles. Sequencing of an average of 209 nucleotides of DNA from 50 individuals revealed no variation except at codon 191, which is known to be involved in a frequent polymorphism. An analysis of 347 different individual DNAs from 10 human populations was conducted to determine Km allelic frequencies within these populations and to apply this type of data collection to population studies.\r"

These isolates included rough and mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Selected isolates were tested by the broth microdilution method to examine the influence of various pHs, inoculum sizes, and biological fluids (serum or sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis). Fleroxacin MICs for 50 and 90% of isolates of P. aeruginosa were 2.0 and 4 micrograms/ml, those for P. cepacia were 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, those for S. aureus were 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, those for H. influenzae were 0.06 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, and those for E. coli were 0.01 and 0.03 micrograms/ml, respectively. Fleroxacin activity against mucoid P. aeruginosa was similar to the activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin but eightfold lower than that of ciprofloxacin. It was twofold more active than norfloxacin and enoxacin but was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and nafcillin against S. aureus. Fleroxacin inhibitory activity against P. cepacia was two- to fourfold lower than that of ciprofloxacin but eightfold greater than those of the other quinolones tested. Alterations in pH, diluent, and inoculum size did not significantly affect fleroxacin activity. These results, combined with available pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution data, support the need for clinical evaluation of fleroxacin in pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.\r"

To analyze the expression of this E. coli gene in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pNJR3-2 or pLA2917 was mobilized via conjugation into P. aeruginosa PAO2 and several well-characterized quinolone-resistant mutants of this strain. The vector pLA2917 did not significantly affect the quinolone susceptibilities of any of the P. aeruginosa strains. However, pNJR3-2 conferred wild-type quinolone susceptibility on P. aeruginosa cfxA (gyrA) mutants and intermediate quinolone susceptibility on cfxA-cfxB double mutants of P. aeruginosa. The quinolone susceptibility of P. aeruginosa PAO2 gyrA+ was unaffected by pNJR3-2. Also, pNJR3-2 had no significant effect on P. aeruginosa cfxB (permeability) mutants. These results demonstrate that the DNA gyrase A gene from E. coli is expressed in P. aeruginosa and confers dominant susceptibility on gyrA mutants. Thus, pNJR3-2 can be used to detect the quinolone resistance mutations that occur in the gyrase A gene of this organism. pNJR3-2 also appears to discriminate between mutations in gyrA and mutations which alter permeability. This gyrase A probe was used successfully in the analysis of quinolone resistance in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa.\r"

  ".U": "91151046\r", 
  ".W": "Ro 23-9424 is a dual-action cephalosporin with an aminothiazolylmethoxyimino-type side chain at the 7 position and fleroxacin esterified at the 3' position. The new compound has broad and potent antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo, reflecting contributions from both the beta-lactam moiety and the quinolone moiety. In animals, the ester bond potentially could be hydrolyzed enzymatically or nonenzymatically, to yield the active metabolites desacetylcefotaxime and fleroxacin. The extent to which Ro 23-9424 acts in vivo as a true dual-action cephalosporin, or acts as a combination of active metabolites, is therefore a function of its pharmacokinetic properties. To investigate these properties, Ro 23-9424 was administered as a single intravenous dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight to mice, rats, dogs, and baboons. Timed plasma samples were assayed by an ion-paired high-pressure liquid chromatography method that allowed detection of both intact Ro 23-9424 and fleroxacin. The pharmacokinetic parameters of Ro 23-9424 were similar to published results for cefotaxime, while concentrations of fleroxacin in plasma were low and fairly constant (about 1 to 3 micrograms/ml) in all species, suggesting that excretion of the intact molecule is a major route of elimination for Ro 23-9424, as it is for cefotaxime. For technical reasons, urinary recovery of Ro 23-9424 was not quantitated, but intact Ro 23-9424 was found in high concentrations (greater than 400 micrograms/ml) in mouse urine aspirated directly from the bladder. In all species, low concentrations of free fleroxacin in plasma persisted after the elimination of Ro 23-9424 was complete, but fleroxacin did not accumulate unduly in a 14-day multiple-dose experiment in baboons. Thus, it seems likely that the activity seen in vivo is primarily due to intact Ro 23-9424, although the low levels of free fleroxacin may also have some therapeutic significance.\r"

All patients in both arms were followed in the same way for 5 years. At 5 years 23 of 37 patients in the control arm and 7 of 33 patients in the treatment arm were dead because of relapse. Actuarial survival curve was statistically significant in favor of patients given adjuvant MMC (p less than 0.001). After 10 years follow-up, 31 of 37 patients in the control arm and 16 out of 33 patients in the treatment arm were dead because of relapse, the statistical differences continuing in the actuarial survival curve in favor of treated patients (p less than 0.01). The best advantages of adjuvant treatment were observed in the T3N0M0 stage. The most frequent relapse site was the peritoneal cavity and the relapse pattern shows special decrease in liver metastases in treated patients. Toxicity was acute and mild. No delayed toxicity or second malignancies were observed. These data suggest that adjuvant MMC after resected surgery of gastric cancer is a successful treatment and its effects are still evident after 10 years of follow-up.\r"

Forty patients with ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis coli received a mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation and a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous cefoxitin. Patients then were randomized to receive intravenous cefoxitin, 1 g every 6 hours, or placebo for 5 days. No differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections. It is concluded that a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous antibiotics provides adequate prophylaxis in the prevention of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileoanal anastomosis.\r"

Thirteen patients have returned for routine postoperative evaluation, the follow-up time ranging from 11 to 49 months (mean, 23 months). Noninvasive two-dimensional, pulsed-wave Doppler and color echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated good anatomical repair and no anastomotic aneurysm formation or residual coarctation of the aorta in any patient after end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone.

Antiproliferative activity of these cytokines on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck monolayers was measured in a colorimetric MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide]-based assay. All 12 cell lines tested were sensitive to IFN-gamma, with the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) ranging from 0.07 +/- 0.001 to 104 +/- 4.6 U/mL. The TNF-alpha showed antiproliferative activity on three cell lines at relatively high doses (ID50 from 55 +/- 4.1 to 847.10 +/- 10 U/mL), and IFN-alpha was growth inhibitory in only one line (ID50 = 1211 +/- 46.2 U/mL). The combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha had a synergistic antiproliferative effect on eight cell lines and an additive effect on two cell lines. In two cell lines, the effect of the combination was equal to that of IFN-gamma alone. A combination of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha resulted in cell growth inhibition in six of the seven lines tested, and this effect was synergistic. These in vitro studies indicate that combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha may be more growth inhibitory against squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and at lower doses than each of these cytokines used singly.\r"

The patients were grouped into four categories: category I, moderate to severe protein depletion without raised metabolic expenditure; category II, moderate to severe protein depletion with raised metabolic expenditure; category III, mild protein depletion without raised metabolic expenditure; and category IV, mild protein depletion with raised metabolic expenditure. After 2 weeks of IVN patients in category I gained a mean(s.e.m.) of 0.43(0.06) kg of body protein (P less than 0.001) and had significant rises in both plasma transferrin and prealbumin (P less than 0.05); patients in category II gained 0.30(0.11) kg of protein (P less than 0.005) and also had significant rises in transferrin and prealbumin (P less than 0.05). Patients in category III lost 0.24(0.11) kg protein (P less than 0.05) and had no changes in either transferrin or prealbumin and patients in category IV lost 0.51(0.13) kg of body protein (P less than 0.001) and although there was a significant rise in plasma prealbumin there was no significant change in plasma transferrin. When postoperative patients were examined separately, they did not differ significantly from preoperative patients except in category I, where their protein gain was only 0.19(0.10) kg, an amount not significantly different from that gained by patients in category II. In each of the four categories described, the changes in total body protein occurring with 2 weeks of IVN were determined by the relative effects of two competing processes; protein depletion and raised metabolic expenditure. With moderate to severe protein depletion (approximately 30 per cent depletion of body protein stores) there was a marked tendency to gain protein with IVN. When the patient had a raised metabolic expenditure or was postoperative this tendency of depleted patients to gain protein was still present but it was less. With only mild protein depletion (approximately 10 per cent depletion) increases in metabolic expenditure made it difficult, if not impossible, to prevent continuing protein loss in spite of aggressive nutritional support. The patient categories we have described determine the response to IVN and form the basis of a new clinical classification of surgical malnutrition.\r"

SETTING: General private practice, family planning and abortion clinic, adolescent clinic, sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and community health clinic in downtown Montreal. PATIENTS: The 2856 patients were included because of symptoms compatible with an STD, a history of sexual contact with a person known or suspected to have chlamydial infection, a history of a nonexclusive sexual relationship or presentation for an abortion. MEASURES: Patient information was obtained by the attending physician on a standard form. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for Chlamydia trachomatis and culture for Neisseria gonorrhoeae were performed on cervical (female) or urethral (male) samples. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of infection. RESULTS: The EIA results were positive in 11.1% of the cases and the culture results in 2.3%. Among the males chlamydial infection was independently associated with low age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.88 per year), heterosexuality (OR = 4.99), urethral discharge (OR = 3.74) and the absence of a history of gonorrhea (OR = 0.51). Gonorrhea was associated with urethral discharge (OR = 24.3) and homosexuality (OR = 3.68). Among the females chlamydial infection was associated with low age (OR = 0.79 per year), a history of sexual contact with a person known to have chlamydial infection (OR = 2.30), multiple sexual partners in the previous 12 months (OR = 1.60) and a reason for the test other than screening purposes (OR = 0.60). Gonorrhea was associated with a reason other than screening (OR = 0.24) and low age (OR = 0.74 per year). Among the patients tested for screening purposes age was the only significant predictor of chlamydial infection (OR = 0.79 per year), and the prevalence of gonorrhea was 0.4%. The actual rate of chlamydial infection was 11.8% among the patients younger than 25 years, 5.7% among those 25 to 34 years and 0.6% among those over 34. CONCLUSIONS: Age alone can be used as a criterion to screen for chlamydial infection among asymptomatic patients without a history of sexual contact with a person known or suspected to have such infection and with a history of a nonexclusive relationship. The prevalence in our population justifies screening people up to 34 years of age.\r"

  ".U": "91152858\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Kistrin is a 68-amino acid polypeptide from the venom of the Malayan pit viper Agkistrodon rhodostoma, which inhibits the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor. Its effect on thrombolysis, reocclusion, and bleeding associated with administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was studied in a canine model of coronary artery thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Coronary patency was monitored for 2 hours by ultrasonic flow probe and repeated coronary angiography. The rt-PA was given as 0.45-mg/kg bolus injections at 15-minute intervals until recanalization or to a maximum of four boluses. Four groups of four or five dogs were studied: a control group that received intravenous heparin (4,000-unit bolus and 1,000 units each hour) and three groups that received heparin and 0.48, 0.24, or 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, administered as a 10% bolus injection and an infusion during a 60-minute period. In the control group, reflow occurred in four of five dogs within 37 +/- 47 minutes but was followed by cyclic reflow and reocclusion. Kistrin at a dose of 0.48 and 0.24 mg/kg reduced the time to reflow to 6 +/- 5 and 10 +/- 3 minutes, respectively, and abolished reocclusion. With 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, reflow occurred in all four animals, within 27 +/- 23 minutes, and reocclusion occurred in two animals. Kistrin induced a dose-related prolongation of the template bleeding time: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, the bleeding time was prolonged from 3.8 +/- 1.3 minutes before infusion to 29 +/- 2 minutes during infusion, but it was shortened to 8.3 +/- 2.6 minutes at 90 minutes after the end of infusion. Kistrin also caused a dose-related inhibition of platelet aggregation with ADP and collagen: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, platelet aggregation was abolished during the infusion but had partially recovered toward the end of the observation period. Pathological examination of recanalized coronary arterial segments of dogs given 0.48 or 0.24 mg/kg kistrin revealed widely patent arteries with some platelets layered on the damaged intimal surface. CONCLUSIONS. Kistrin increases the rate and extent of thrombolysis with a reduced dose of rt-PA, and it prevents reocclusion. At an effective dose, it is associated with a transient prolongation of the bleeding time and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Kistrin may offer promise as adjunctive treatment to thrombolytic agents in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Optimal coronary thrombolysis should be prompt and persistent. Although activation of platelets and increased thrombin activity have been associated with clinical thrombolysis, the role of each in delaying thrombolysis or inducing early coronary reocclusion has been difficult to define. METHODS AND RESULTS. In conscious dogs with coronary thrombosis induced by electrical current, we assessed the impact on the rapidity of thrombolysis and the incidence of reocclusion of two types of adjunctive treatment given concomitantly with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): 1) inhibition of platelet function with a peptide mimetic antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors or with lysine acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 2) inhibition of thrombin activity with recombinant hirudin or with heparin. ASA but not the receptor antagonist shortened the time to thrombolysis with t-PA (20 +/- 13 [mean +/- SD] minutes with ASA, 36 +/- 15 minutes with receptor antagonist, and 43 +/- 16 minutes with the saline control). Reocclusion occurred promptly after completion of the infusion of t-PA in all seven dogs given saline. Reocclusion was delayed and prevented in some dogs within 90 minutes after the end of the infusion of t-PA by both antiplatelet agents but still occurred in 42% despite continued inhibition of platelet function (i.e., three of six dogs given ASA and two of six given receptor antagonist). In contrast, inhibition of thrombin activity with recombinant hirudin in a dose that prolonged the partial thromboplastin time modestly (1.5-2-fold) resulted in accelerated lysis (19 +/- 10 minutes) and prevention of reocclusion in each of six dogs. Heparin given in doses that elicited similar prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time did not accelerate lysis nor prevent reocclusion, which occurred in five of six dogs. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of thrombin by recombinant hirudin facilitates thrombolysis and maintains patency of coronary arteries recanalized with t-PA particularly effectively. The benefit conferred may reflect direct anticoagulant effects plus diminished activation of platelets secondary to decreased thrombin activity.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The influence of coronary collateral vessels on infarct size in humans remains controversial, partly because no previous study has examined the impact of collaterals present at the onset of acute myocardial infarction on infarct size. METHODS AND RESULTS. The present study used the data base of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase I trial to correlate the presence or absence of angiographically documented collaterals in the initial hours of myocardial infarct evolution with the size of the infarct as assessed by serial measurements of serum creatine kinase (CK). To avoid the confounding effects of reperfusion on enzymatic estimates of infarct size, this report is limited to those 125 patients who failed to recanalize at 90 minutes after administration of tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase. Patients with angiographically documented collaterals (group A, n = 51) had significantly lower values of peak serum CK than patients without collaterals (group B, n = 74) (1,877 +/- 216 versus 2,661 +/- 212 IU/l, respectively [mean +/- SEM], p = 0.004). Similarly, CK-derived infarct size estimates were significantly lower in group A than in group B (20.6 +/- 2.5 versus 31.4 +/- 2.8 CK gram equivalents, p = 0.001). The infarct size observed in patients with collaterals was less for anterior infarctions as well as for infarctions of other locations; thus, the beneficial effects of collaterals were independent of the site of the infarct. In 65 of the 125 patients who failed to reperfuse, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed by contrast ventriculography both at initial cardiac catheterization (before thrombolytic therapy) and at hospital discharge. Among the patients who had both studies, global LVEF tended to increase from pretreatment to hospital discharge in group A (from 50.6 +/- 1.8% to 53.4 +/- 1.8%, p = 0.10) but decreased in group B patients (from 50.3 +/- 1.8% to 47.8 +/- 1.7%, p = 0.02). At hospital discharge, global LVEF was greater in patients with coronary collaterals (53.5 +/- 1.7% versus 49.6 +/- 1.7%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. The results demonstrate that, in patients in whom thrombolytic therapy fails to induce reperfusion, the presence of coronary collateral vessels at the onset of myocardial infarction is associated with limitation of infarct size as assessed enzymatically and with improved ventricular function on discharge as assessed by LVEF.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Oxygen-15-labeled water is a diffusible, metabolically inert myocardial blood flow tracer with a short half-life (2 minutes) that can be used quantitatively with positron emission tomography (PET). The purpose of this study was to validate a new technique to quantify myocardial blood flow (MBF) in animals and to assess its application in patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. The technique involves the administration of 15O-labeled carbon dioxide (C15O2) and rapid dynamic scanning. Arterial and myocardial time activity curves were fitted to a single tissue compartment tracer kinetic model to estimate MBF in each myocardial region. Validation studies consisted of 52 simultaneous measurements of MBF with PET and gamma-labeled microspheres in nine closed-chest dogs over a flow range of 0.5-6.1 ml/g/min. A good correlation between the two methods was obtained (y = 0.36 + 1.0x, r = 0.91). Human studies consisted of 11 normal volunteers and eight patients with chronic stable angina and single-vessel disease, before and after intravenous dipyridamole infusion. In the normal group, MBF was homogeneous throughout the left ventricle both at rest and after administration of dipyridamole (0.88 +/- 0.08 ml/g/min and 3.52 +/- 1.12 ml/g/min, respectively; p less than or equal to 0.001). In patients, resting MBF was similar in the distribution of the normal and stenotic arteries (1.03 +/- 0.23 and 0.93 +/- 0.21 ml/g/min, respectively). After dipyridamole infusion, MBF in normally perfused areas increased to 2.86 +/- 0.83 ml/g/min, whereas in the regions supplied by stenotic arteries it increased to only 1.32 +/- 0.27 ml/g/min (p less than or equal to 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. PET with C15O2 inhalation provides an accurate noninvasive quantitative method for measuring regional myocardial blood flow in patients.\r"

Fifty-five patients were treated with urokinase-preactivated prourokinase (n = 35) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (n = 20) for acute myocardial infarction and underwent coronary angiography at 90 minutes and at 24-36 hours into thrombolysis, and fibrinogen (Ratnoff-Menzie), D-dimer (ELISA) and thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels (ELISA) were measured. Primary patency was achieved in 39 patients (70.9%), 13 of whom (33.3%) suffered early reocclusion. Nonsignificant decreases in fibrinogen levels were observed while D-dimer levels increased +3,008 +/- 4,047 micrograms/l (p less than 0.01), differences not being significant in respect to the thrombolytic agents or to the clinical course. In contrast, while thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels decreased -4.4 +/- 13.0 micrograms/l in patients with persistent patency, they increased +7.5 +/- 13.6 micrograms/l in case of nonsuccessful thrombolysis (p less than 0.02) and +11.9 +/- 23.8 micrograms/l in case of early reocclusion (p less than 0.001). For patients with thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels greater than 6 ng/l 120 minutes into thrombolysis, the unfavorable clinical course was predicted with 96.2% sensitivity and 93.1% specificity. CONCLUSION. Generation of thrombin, occurring during thrombolysis, is a major determinant for the success of therapy and thrombin-antithrombin III levels may serve as predictors for the short-term prognosis.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, phase 2 trial. SETTING: Surgical ICU, university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-one (15 male, six female) patients, ages 49 to 75 yr (mean 65 +/- 5), undergoing elective myocardial revascularization. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-one patients with postoperative hypertension after coronary artery bypass graft surgery received iv isradipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonist. Mean duration of the isradipine infusion was 96.9 +/- 29 min. Mean dose of isradipine, indexed to weight, was 16.63 +/- 6.66 micrograms/kg (n = 20). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty of the 21 patients achieved satisfactory BP control. The reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), first noted at the 15-min point, was maximal at 1 hr when MAP decreased from 102 +/- 9 mm Hg baseline to 81 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than .01), accompanied by a significant (p less than .01) decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1753 +/- 339 baseline to 1180 +/- 229 dyne.sec/cm5. The CVP, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure did not change significantly. Heart rate and cardiac index increased; however, stroke volume index did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Isradipine is an acceptable agent for the treatment of hypertension in this setting.\r"

After culture for 5 days, follicles were incubated in the presence of TSH (10 mU/ml) for 1 h and fixed for electron microscopic and immunohistochemical examination. Regardless of the presence of IFN gamma, suspended follicles became inverted within 5 days. However, MHC class II antigens were expressed only in inverted follicles cultured with IFN gamma. In inverted follicles cultured without IFN gamma, TSH stimulation induced remarkable morphological changes, such as elongation of microvilli and an appearance of pseudopods. On the other hand, the follicles cultured with IFN gamma showed poor response to TSH. Thus, IFN gamma induced the expression of MHC class II antigens of cultured thyroid follicles and inhibited TSH-induced morphological changes in the cells.\r"

Each protein was found to have the same NH2-terminus and its sequence was identical to that of follistatin, which is a specific inhibitor of identical to that of follistatin, which is a specific inhibitor of FSH release. Moreover, the binding protein was shown to inhibit the spontaneous FSH release from cultured pituitary cells as does follistatin. These properties are the same as activin-binding protein that we have obtained from rat ovary. These results support a conclusion that activin-binding protein/follistatin exists also in the pituitary. Activin-binding protein has an ability to inhibit the activin-induced augmentation of FSH release from cultured pituitary cells as does inhibin. However, the inhibitory pattern by the binding protein was quite distinct from that of inhibin, suggesting that there may be different mechanism(s) for their antagonistic actions. Stoichiometric inhibition as shown by gel filtration analysis indicates that activin-binding protein binds activin to form an inactive equimolar complex having neither stimulatory nor inhibitory activity for FSH secretion by the pituitary. These findings suggest that activin is actually involved in FSH secretion in the pituitary and that the activin action in the pituitary is regulated by activin-binding protein/follistatin.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we have tested the direct effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) on lactate production by Sertoli cells isolated from immature porcine testes. In Sertoli cells cultured in a defined medium, TGF beta 1 was shown to stimulate lactate production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The maximal and half-maximal effects of TGF beta 1 on lactate production were obtained in the picomolar concentration range, respectively 24 and 8 pM TGF beta 1. TGF beta 1 action was found closely related to that of insulin since 1) both TGF beta 1 (40 pM) and insulin (1 microgram/ml) induced the secretion of similar and nonadditive amounts of lactate; and 2) TGF beta 1 and insulin induced comparable increases in lactate production in FSH (1 microgram/ml)-treated Sertoli cells. Because lactate is derived from glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG) was used to investigate the hexose transport system of Sertoli cells after insulin, FSH, and TGF beta 1 treatments. Insulin (1 microgram/ml) and FSH (1 microgram/ml) were found to stimulate 2-DOG transport with a similar time course, with an effect detected up to 30 min and maximal at 150 min. In contrast, although TGF beta 1 also enhanced 2-DOG uptake by Sertoli cells, the increase in glucose transport was delayed, since the TGF beta 1 effect was first detected at 150 min and was maximal at 360 min. These effects of TGF beta 1 action on Sertoli cell activity are exerted through specific membrane TGF beta 1 receptors. Scatchard analysis of the binding of TGF beta 1 to cultured Sertoli cells revealed the presence of both a high affinity (Kd, approximately 180 pM) and a low affinity binding site systems for TGF beta 1. Affinity labeling of these receptors by covalent attachment to [125I] TGF beta 1 with disuccinimidyl suberate and subsequent electrophoretic analysis of the labeled complexes revealed the specific binding of [125I] TGF beta 1 to three predominant molecules of 260, 130, and 70 kDa. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that testicular Sertoli cells are targets for TGF beta 1 action. In view of the importance of lactate as a substrate for germ cells, it is suggested that TGF beta 1 might also be involved in the development of normal germinal epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Five monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were generated (3A, 4B, 5F, 2E, 1E) by immunizing BALB/c mice with human (h) FSH. The mabs were used to relate antigenic structures (epitopes) to function (receptor binding). All five mabs could immunoneutralize (inhibit binding to receptor) hFSH and could be placed into two groups based on potency (degree of neutralization). Group I mabs (5F, 2E, 1E) were less potent than group II mabs (3A, 4B) even though group I mabs had a 2-fold higher average affinity constant than group II. Those data suggested that group II mabs recognize an epitope near or in the receptor binding site of hFSH. Immunoradiometric epitope cross-matching demonstrated that group I and group II mabs recognize different epitopes. Further characterization of 5F and 3A (representative of group I and group II, respectively) utilized an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a RIA. In the ELISA, both mabs bound hFSH and hFSH alpha but not hFSH beta. In the RIA, 3A bound [125I]hFSH and [125I]hFSH alpha but not [125I]hFSH beta. In contrast, 5F bound only [125I]hFSH. hFSH effectively competed with [125I]hFSH for 5F and 3A. In contrast, hFSH alpha competed with [125I]hFSH for 5F but not for 3A even though 3A could bind hFSH alpha in the ELISA and the RIA. These results suggest that 3A and 5F recognize different epitopes. The epitope recognized by 3A is unique in that its conformation appears to be dependent on association with hFSH beta. Since 3A was a more potent inhibitor of receptor binding than 5F, its epitope specificity was characterized further by epitope mapping. This was accomplished utilizing a peptide ELISA and by affinity chromatography. The results from epitope mapping demonstrated that 3A recognizes sequences 61-78 and 73-92 with binding to 73-92 being 4-fold greater than to 61-78. Thus, the epitope comprised of sequence 73-92 (and to a lesser extent 61-78) appears to be important for receptor binding.\r"

Deprivation of bovine TSH had no effect on the expression of RT1.B antigen by IFN gamma. A23187 (1 nM to 2 microM) and/or 10 nM to 10 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not induce the expression of RT1.B antigen. IFN gamma-induced RT1.B expression was not inhibited by either 10 nM to 100 microM 1-(5-isoquinolysulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine or 200 nM to 200 microM 8-(N,N-dimethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride. It was also not inhibited by either 5-200 microM verapamil or 500 nM to 20 microM trifluoperazine. However, 0.01-10 micrograms/ml cycloheximide inhibited IFN gamma-induced RT1.B antigen expression in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that IFN gamma induces RT1.B antigen expression in FRTL-5 cells via de novo protein synthesis independent of the cAMP system, phosphatidylinositide system, and voltage-dependent calcium channel.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the regulation of preovulatory and steroid-induced surges of gonadotropins in the female rat was examined. The specific and potent noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 was used for blockade of NMDA neurotransmission. MK801 treatment completely inhibited the ability of progesterone to induce LH and FSH surges in the estrogen-primed ovariectomized rat. Administration of MK801 on proestrus in the immature female rat primed with PMSG resulted in a significant attenuation of the proestrous LH, FSH, and PRL surge and a corresponding attenuation of ovulation. Similarly, in the adult cycling female rat, MK801 administration on proestrus led to a significant attenuation of the proestrous LH and PRL surges. Mean FSH levels were lower in MK801-treated adult rats than in vehicle-treated rats, but this effect was not significant. In the estrogen-primed ovariectomized immature rat, the agonist NMDA caused a rapid (less than 10 min) elevation of LH and FSH in vivo. The gonadotropin-releasing effect of NMDA may be mediated at the level of the hypothalamus, since the medial basal hypothalamus/preoptic area of NMDA-treated rats killed 3 and 5 min post-NMDA had a significantly greater release of GnRH in vitro than that of vehicle-treated rats. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the preovulatory gonadotropin surge in the female rat is dependent on NMDA neurotransmission for its expression and add further evidence for a critically important role for NMDA receptors in the physiological regulation of gonadotropin secretion in the female rat.\r"

Rh inhibin caused dose-related decreases in mean plasma FSH, but not LH, levels in ovariectomized female rats 14 days old and older. The duration of this inhibition was proportional to the dose of rh inhibin, but no consistent changes in FSH secretion were observed until 4 h after treatment. Maximum suppression of FSH release was observed at about 15 micrograms rh inhibin/kg BW and lasted 8-10 h. Measurement of the area under the curve from 4-12 h after injection of inhibin indicated a dose-related decrease in total FSH secreted. When blood samples were withdrawn every 10 min to evaluate pulsatile gonadotropin release, analysis of FSH pulse parameters indicated that rh inhibin (25 micrograms/kg) interfered with pulse frequency, amplitude, and peak levels in both intact and ovariectomized rats. In contrast, pulsatile LH secretion was not measurably altered. These results demonstrate that rh inhibin acts primarily at the level of the pituitary to inhibit all parameters of FSH secretion and suggest that this effect is at least not entirely mediated by changes in GnRH receptors.\r"

Electron microscopic immunocytochemical analysis has shown this protein to be localized primarily in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Rat exocrine pancreatic tumor cell lines, whether grown in tissue culture (AR42J) or as a tumor mass after sc injection into rats (DSL-2), lacked detectable amounts of this [3H]estradiol-binding protein (EBP), as determined by the dextran-coated charcoal assay. Furthermore, primary exocrine pancreatic neoplasms induced with the carcinogen azaserine contained little or no detectable [3H]estradiol-binding activity. However, electron immunocytochemical studies of transformed cells indicated the presence of material that cross-reacted with antibodies prepared against the [3H]EBP. The immunopositive reaction in transformed cells was localized almost exclusively in lipid granules. Such lipid organelles in normal acinar cells, although present less frequently than in transformed cells, have never been observed to contain EBP-like immunopositive material. Presumably, the aberrant localization of EBP in these acinar tumor cells results in loss of function of this protein, which in normal pancreatic acinar cells appears to exert a modulating influence on zymogen granule formation and the process of secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the expression of the rat inhibin genes in the maternal ovary during pregnancy. RNA blot analysis indicates that the inhibin-alpha chain mRNA is expressed in the ovary throughout gestation at levels comparable to those observed in cycling rats. In situ hybridization shows that the inhibin-alpha and -beta A mRNAs are produced in the granulosa cells of developing antral follicles; little or no hybridization to functional corpora lutea is observed. Early in pregnancy, a large number of follicles hybridize to both alpha- and beta A-inhibin cDNA probes. Many of these follicles undergo atresia during the first half of pregnancy, and the number of inhibin-expressing follicles reaches a nadir on day 15. This is followed by an increase in inhibin-producing follicles, which peaks just before parturition. The increase in inhibin-expressing follicles observed in late pregnancy corresponds to a small rise in serum inhibin levels, as measured using an alpha chain-specific RIA. After the first postpartum ovulation, few hybridizing follicles are observed. Ovariectomy in either early (day 6) or mid (day 15) pregnancy results in a significant fall in serum inhibin levels and a robust increase in serum FSH levels 9 h after surgery. These results suggest that inhibin is produced by the maternal ovary during pregnancy, that its synthesis is modulated during late gestation, and that inhibin may play a role in regulating FSH secretion during pregnancy.\r"

Blood volume expansion by iv infusion of isotonic saline at 1 ml/min elevated irANF concentrations by 132% after 1 h and by 233% after 2 h. Reduction of the vascular volume by nonhypotensive hemorrhage of 10% and then 20% of the total blood volume reduced irANF levels by 16% and 42%, respectively, 5 min after blood removal was completed. Similarly, in birds deprived of water for 24 h and with blood volume reduced by 4.8%, plasma irANF concentrations were 50% lower than in the same euhydrated animals. The observed correlation between plasma irANF concentrations and vascular volume is consistent with the concept that ANF has a physiological role in avian volume homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Activins, dimers of inhibin beta subunits, are potent stimulators of FSH secretion in vivo and in vitro and of FSH beta mRNA expression in rat anterior pituitary cultures. In this study, we investigated the possibility that locally secreted activin B (beta B beta B) may function as an autocrine modulator of basal FSH secretion and expression based on the previous observation that beta B is expressed within gonadotropes. The incubation of cultured rat anterior pituitary cells with a m mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the activin B homodimer (MAb-activin B) significantly attenuated the basal secretion of FSH in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, without influencing LH secretion. Moreover, MAb-activin B selectively inhibited FSH beta mRNA accumulation without affecting either LH beta or alpha subunit mRNAs. The MAb-activin B completely blocked the stimulation of FSH secretion by exogenous activin B, but not by activin A, confirming its specificity. As previously shown, inhibin A and follistatin significantly suppressed basal FSH secretion in these cultures. This inhibitory effect, albeit of lower magnitude, was still evident even in the presence of the MAb-activin B which by itself suppressed basal FSH secretion. These data suggest that the secretion of activin B by the gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary may serve as an autocrine signal in the selective modulation of FSH expression and secretion. Furthermore, the inhibitory actions of inhibins and follistatins on gonadotropes may, in part, be explained by their ability to interfere with the actions of endogenous activin B.\r"

  ".W": "With radiotracer and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) methods, we studied the time course of glycogen resynthesis after three 90-s episodes of hypoxemia in both control and diabetic rats in vivo. Glycogen synthesis was measured in the presence and absence of infused insulin and compared with the changes in glycogen synthase (GS) and phosphorylase activities. We observed in 13C-NMR spectra the expected mobilization of glycogen during hypoxia in vivo. In control rats with or without exogenous insulin, this was followed by a rapid resynthesis of glycogen during a 40-min recovery period. A marked activation of GS was observed by 10 min (glucose-6-phosphate-independent form of GS [GSl] = 0.65 mumol.min-1.g-1 or 92% of total GS), and activation persisted up to 40 min in both groups. Glycogen synthesis during the recovery period averaged 0.51 and 0.45 mumol.min-1.g-1 in the saline- and insulin-treated rats, respectively. In the diabetic rats by 10 min after hypoxemia, GSl increased only modestly in both saline-treated (0.16 mumol.min-1.g-1) and insulin-treated (0.21 mumol.min-1.g-1) rats, and activation persisted up to 40 min only with insulin treatment. Glycogen synthesis was slower in the diabetic rats given insulin (0.28 mumol.min-1.g-1) and essentially absent in the saline-treated rats (0.03 mumol.min-1.g-1) compared with controls. We conclude that recovery from hypoxemia is accompanied by a marked activation of GSl and rapid rates of glycogen synthesis in nondiabetic rats, and diabetes markedly blunts this response. Acute insulin infusion only partially overcomes this block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to no treatment or to treatment with either 1 or 3 MU of alpha-interferon given three times a week for 24 wk. Forty-five patients (75%) were positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus. During the 24-wk treatment period, mean serum ALT levels decreased in both treatment groups, but the decrease was statistically significant only in the 3 MU group. However, at 24 wk, the proportion of patients with normal ALT levels was similar in the 3 MU group (39%) and the 1 MU group (45%), and both were significantly higher than in controls (0%). Repeat liver biopsy specimens showed a significant decrease in the severity of histological changes in the 3 MU group but not in the 1 MU group or in controls.

After treatment, the mean ALT levels rose in both treated groups. The proportion of patients with normal ALT levels at wk 48 was 28% in the 3 MU group and 20% in the 1 MU group.

Therefore density and affinity of glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites of bile duct-ligated rats with ascites (n = 10) and of sham-operated controls (n = 10) were determined. Glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites were identified to be of the B-(\"biologically active\") and C-(\"clearance\") receptor type. Discrimination and quantitative determination of B and C receptors for atrial natriuretic factor were achieved by displacement experiments with atrial natriuretic factor(99-126) or des(18-22)atrial natriuretic factor(4-23), an analogue binding to C receptors only. Density of total glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites was significantly increased in bile duct-ligated rats (3,518 +/- 864 vs. 1,648 +/- 358 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05). This was due to a significant increase of C-receptor density (3,460 +/- 866 vs. 1,486 +/- 363 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05), whereas density of B receptors was not significantly different in bile duct-ligated rats (58 +/- 11 vs. 162 +/- 63 fmol/mg protein). Affinity of atrial natriuretic factor to its glomerular binding sites did not differ significantly between both groups. These data suggest that an altered glomerular atrial natriuretic factor receptor density could be involved in the renal resistance to atrial natriuretic factor in cirrhosis with ascites.\r"

We studied the splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics in the murine model of schistosomiasis by radioactive microsphere technique. Mice infected with 60 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni (n = 8) were studied hemodynamically 11 wk after the infection and were compared with age-matched healthy controls (n = 11). Mean portal venous inflow in the infected mice (3.82 +/- 0.32 ml/min) was 61% higher than in the healthy animals (2.37 +/- 0.25 ml/min; p less than 0.01). A twofold increase in hepatic arterial flow was also seen in mice with schistosomiasis (0.47 +/- 0.14 ml/min) as compared with controls (0.16 +/- 0.03 ml/min; p less than 0.05), whereas splanchnic arteriolar resistance (60.91 +/- 7.64 vs. 101.21 +/- 11.06 mm Hg.min.ml-1.gm; p less than 0.05) and peripheral vascular resistance (112.05 +/- 14.05 vs 254.53 +/- 29.86 mm Hg.min.ml-1.gm; p less than 0.01) were reduced. There was a significant increase in cardiac index (752 +/- 99 vs. 453 +/- 55 ml.min-1.kg body weight-1; p less than 0.05) and reduction in mean arterial pressure (81.37 +/- 3.09 vs. 101.45 +/- 5.85 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) in the infected animals compared with controls. These observations clearly demonstrate the existence of a hyperdynamic circulatory state in this model of portal hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine could be used to chemically sympathectomize neonatal miniature swine, eight newborn swine were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine beginning on the first day after birth and continuing at regular intervals for the next 6 months. Six littermates served as controls and received vehicle injections. A significant reduction in the pressor response to intravenous tyramine (95%) and in the tissue norepinephrine content of the kidneys, left ventricle, and gastrocnemius muscle (more than 93%) provided evidence for an effective long-term sympathectomy in the 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animals. In addition, the blood pressure response of these young, chemically sympathectomized swine to chronic deoxycorticosterone acetate treatment was evaluated. Mean arterial pressure before deoxycorticosterone was similar in the 6-hydroxydopamine-treated (116 +/- 2 mm Hg) and control (125 +/- 5 mm Hg) groups. One week after deoxycorticosterone, mean arterial pressure had risen significantly by 20-22 mm Hg in both groups. Blood pressure continued to increase in the control group, reaching a value of 163 +/- 6 mm Hg by the third week after treatment. In contrast, mean arterial pressure in the 6-hydroxydopamine group did not increase further during weeks 2 and 3 after deoxycorticosterone. In conclusion, chronic treatment of neonatal swine with 6-hydroxydopamine produced an animal model with an effective, general, peripheral sympathectomy. The significant attenuation of the hypertensive response in these sympathectomized animals lends further support to the hypothesis that an intact sympathetic nervous system is necessary for the full expression of deoxycorticosterone hypertension in miniature swine.\r"

  ".W": "Although hyperinsulinemia and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration can occur in patients with hypertension, there is no information available concerning the dynamic state of high density lipoprotein metabolism. To address this issue, we quantified high density lipoprotein turnover in 12 patients with mild hypertension and 11 matched subjects with normal blood pressure. Patients with high blood pressure had lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Fractional catabolic rates of 125I-apolipoprotein AI (apoAI)/high density lipoprotein were faster in patients with hypertension (0.36 +/- 0.02 versus 0.26 +/- 0.02 l/day, p less than 0.001). Total synthetic rates of apoAI were also significantly greater in patients with high blood pressure (17.4 +/- 1.1 versus 13.2 +/- 0.6 mg/kg/day, p less than 0.001). Although significant correlation was observed between blood pressure and fractional catabolic rate of 125I-apoAI/high density lipoprotein in the experimental population (r = 0.52, p less than 0.01), no relation was found when patients with normal blood pressure or hypertension were considered separately. However, a highly significant positive correlation was found between 125I-apoAI/high density lipoprotein fractional catabolic rate and insulin concentration in the entire population (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001). In conclusion, the patients with mild hypertension studied were hyperinsulinemic, had a faster fractional catabolic rate of 125I-apoAI/high density lipoprotein, and a lower high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration. It is suggested that the changes seen in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration and 125I-apoAI/high density lipoprotein fractional catabolic rates were secondary to the hyperinsulinemia and not due to the high blood pressure per se.\r"

Propranolol was administered in drinking water to 20 animals for a period of 6 wk at a dose of 10 mg.kg-1d-1, starting at 5 wk of schistosomal infection. 32 age-matched mice with chronic schistosomal infection served as controls. All animals were studied 11 wk after the infection. Compared with controls the portal pressure (10.8 +/- 0.40 mmHg) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in the propranolol-treated animals (7.9 +/- 0.80 mmHg). Portal-systemic shunting was decreased by 79%, from 12.2 +/- 3.34% in controls to 2.5 +/- 0.99% in the propranolol group (P less than 0.05). Portal venous inflow was reduced by 38% in the propranolol treated animals (2.50 +/- 0.73 ml/min; n = 6) compared with controls (4.00 +/- 0.34 ml/min; n = 8; P less than 0.05). The worm burden, the granulomatous reaction, the collagen content of the liver, and the serum bile acid levels were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. These results demonstrate that in chronic liver disease induced by schistosomiasis, the development of portal-systemic shunting can be decreased or prevented by the reduction of flow and pressure in the portal system.\r"

Each is thought to result from a different mutant allele at the tyrosinase locus, with the mutation producing an enzyme with little or no activity in all involved tissues. In this paper, we report a new type of OCA that results from a tyrosinase allele producing a temperature-sensitive enzyme. The proband had white hair in the warmer areas (scalp and axilla) and progressively darker hair in the cooler areas (extremities) of her body. Melanocyte and melanosome architecture were normal. Quantitative hairbulb tyrosinase (dopa oxidase) assay demonstrated a loss of activity above 35-37 degrees C. Plasma pheomelanin and urine eumelanin intermediates were reduced and correlated with hair melanin content. This is the first temperature-sensitive tyrosinase mutation to be reported in humans and is analogous to the Siamese mutation in the cat and the Himalayan mutation in the mouse.\r"

To investigate the mechanism, t-PA was incubated with plasma in the presence or absence of a fibrin clot, and the extent of fibrinogenolysis was determined by measuring B beta 1-42. In the presence of fibrin, there is a 21-fold increase in B beta 1-42 levels. The potentiation of fibrinogenolysis in the presence of fibrin is mediated by soluble fibrin degradation products because (a) the extent of t-PA induced fibrinogenolysis and clot lysis are directly related, (b) once clot lysis has been initiated, fibrinogenolysis continues even after the clot is removed, and (c) lysates of cross-linked fibrin clots potentiate t-PA-mediated fibrinogenolysis. Fibrin degradation products stimulate fibrinogenolysis by binding t-PA and plasminogen because approximately 70% of the labeled material in the clot lysates binds to both t-PA- and plasminogen-Sepharose, and only the bound fractions have potentiating activity. The binding site for t-PA and plasminogen is on the E domain because characterization of the potentiating fragments using gel filtration followed by PAGE and immunoblotting indicates that the major species is (DD)E complex, whereas minor components include high-molecular weight derivatives containing the (DD)E complex and fragment E. In contrast, D-dimer is the predominant species found in the fractions that do not bind to the adsorbants, and it has no potentiating activity. Thus, soluble products of t-PA-induced lysis of cross-linked fibrin potentiate t-PA-mediated fibrinogenolysis by providing a surface for t-PA and plasminogen binding thereby promoting plasmin generation. The occurrence of this phenomenon after therapeutic thrombolysis may explain the limited clot selectivity of t-PA.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking of the surface antigen receptor on B lymphocytes has been demonstrated to lead to activation of phospholipase C (PLC) with subsequent increases in production of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol. In turn, these second messengers increase cytosolic free calcium [( Ca2+]i) and activate the serine threonine phosphotransferase protein kinase C (PKC). These processes are thought to play a major role in B cell activation and proliferation. However, the mechanism linking the B lymphocyte antigen receptor to phospholipase C remains to be identified. We demonstrate herein that activation of the antigen receptor on human lymphocytes, in addition to activation of PLC, increases tyrosine phosphorylation of specific substrates. Tyrphostins, a new class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors which compete for substrate binding site of specific tyrosine kinases have recently been synthesized. Preincubation of B lymphocytes with two different tyrphostins blocked anti-IgM-induced proliferation, oncogene expression, tyrosine phosphorylation, increases in [Ca2+]i, and production of inositol phosphates. The same inhibitors were without effect on B cell proliferation induced by phorbol esters and cation ionophores which directly activate PKC and increase [Ca2+]i thus bypassing PLC. These findings strongly indicate that tyrphostins do not exhibit significant nonspecific toxicity and suggest that they act proximal to PLC. The ability of the tyrphostins to block increases in [Ca2+]i and inositol phosphate production, after activation of the B cell antigen receptor, indicates that a tyrosine kinase acts as an essential link between the B cell antigen receptor and PLC.\r"

In in situ hybridization experiments the signal specific for Na(+)-pump alpha 1 subunit message was strongest above columnar epithelial cells of air-conducting structures. Strong labeling was also present above cuboidal cells lining the forming alveoli, but not above mesenchymal cells. Immunocytochemical localization of the protein paralleled the distribution of the mRNA. Mesenchymal cells were more abundant in fetal lungs of diabetic mothers, and thus the decreased overall levels of Na+,K(+)-ATPase may result from the observed morphological pulmonary immaturity. One day after birth there was no apparent difference in lung morphology at the light microscopic level, in the localization or the steady-state level of Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha 1 isoform mRNA, or in enzyme activity. Na+,K(+)-ATPase has a likely role in the active phase of fluid absorption in the airways of newborns before the onset of breathing. Decreased fluid clearance and lack of thinning of the lung's connective tissue may contribute to the increased risk for respiratory distress in infants of diabetic mothers.\r"

  ".W": "This study indicates that hydrocortisone (HC) markedly increases the synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE) by interleukin 4 (IL-4)-stimulated human lymphocytes. The effect is glucocorticoid specific and is obtained with low concentrations of HC (0.1-10 microM). In both the early and the late phase of the IL-4-induced response HC exerts its effects which are respectively IL-4 dependent and IL-4 independent. The IgE potentiation cannot be explained by the inhibition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production since it is observed in the absence of endogenous secretion of IFN-gamma. HC inhibits the production of IgE-binding factors (soluble CD23) and the expression of the low-affinity receptor for IgE, also known as the (Fc epsilon RII) CD23 antigen; however, the residual expression of Fc epsilon RII by IL-4- and HC-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is important since the IgE response of these cells is markedly inhibited by anti-CD23 monoclonal antibody. HC acts mainly by amplifying the cellular interactions between monocytes and lymphocytes; indeed, HC has no effect on monocyte-depleted PBMCs, and moreover, monocytes cannot be replaced by soluble factors. Most importantly, T cells are not required for the induction of IgE synthesis by costimulation with IL-4 and HC. However, the IgE response of rigorously T cell-depleted PBMCs may be further increased by the addition of T cells. Further analysis of the permissive effect of HC on the synthesis of IgE by T cell-depleted PBMCs suggests that HC acts in synergy with IL-4 to trigger the activation and the differentiation of B cells into IgE-producing cells.\r"

  ".W": "Recently it was demonstrated that growth factors are bound to the extracellular matrix, and can regulate cell behavior. Using three different types of binding assays, we have examined the interaction of interferon-gamma with a basement membrane produced by the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor. Basement membrane was found to bind interferon-gamma in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Equilibrium binding analysis revealed a high-affinity site with a dissociation constant of 1.5 10(-9) M and a maximum binding capacity of 1.6 10(9) sites/mm2 of basement membrane. Competition studies show that the binding is inhibited by heparan sulfate, suggesting that basement membrane-heparan sulfate proteoglycan could be the binding site. This interaction was clearly confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and dot-blot analysis with purified basement membrane molecules. Furthermore, the carboxy-terminal part of the interferon-gamma molecule contains an amino acid cluster, very closely related to a consensus sequence, present in more than 20 proteins known to bind sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin. These data demonstrate a possible role of extracellular matrix components in storing cytokines and in modulating the cellular response to such factors.\r"

  ".W": "Rab is a newly identified family of small G-proteins that share 35-70% homology with the yeast Sec4p and Ypt1p involved in the regulation of the secretory pathway. Mature phagocytes display functions requiring organized intracellular traffic and, for this reason, we questioned whether phagocyte differentiation could correlate with the increased expression of rab proteins. Rabbit antisera raised against the recombinant proteins rab1Ap, 2p, 4p, and 6p were able to detect the corresponding proteins in the human monoblast leukemic cell line U937. When these cells were induced to differentiate into monocyte/macrophage-like cells displaying functional characteristics of a normal phagocyte, rab1Ap, 2p, 4p, and 6p were increased and this correlated with an increase in the rab transcripts. Using a rab5 probe, we also observed an increased expression of the rab5 gene in differentiated cells. Similarly, differentiation of the human leukemic myeloblast HL60 cell line along either monocyte or granulocyte pathways induced an increased expression of the rab proteins. Rab proteins were also detected in human neutrophils and in guinea pig alveolar macrophages. As degranulation is one of the phagocyte functions acquired in the late stage of differentiation, we investigated whether rab proteins would be involved in this process. Although rab proteins were tightly membrane bound, none of them was detected in the specific or azurophil granules purified from human neutrophils. The increased expression of rab proteins in mature phagocytes suggests that they may promote functions highly developed in these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular cystine loading with cystine dimethyl ester inhibits volume absorption, transepithelial potential difference, glucose transport, and bicarbonate transport in proximal convoluted tubules perfused in vitro. This study examined the roles of ATP and NaK ATPase in this in vitro model of the Fanconi syndrome of cystinosis. Intracellular ATP was measured using the luciferin-luciferase assay. Intracellular ATP was reduced by 60% in proximal convoluted tubules incubated with 0.5 mM cystine dimethyl ester for 15 min at 37 degrees C (P less than 0.001). Incubation of cystine loaded tubules with 1 mM exogenous ATP increased intracellular ATP to levels not significantly different than that of controls. On the other hand, Vmax NaK ATPase activity was unchanged even though the incubation times and the concentration of cystine dimethyl ester were doubled to 30 min and 1 mM, respectively. In proximal convoluted tubules perfused in vitro, 0.5 mM cystine dimethyl ester resulted in an 89% inhibition in volume absorption (0.81 +/- 0.14 to 0.09 +/- 0.09 nl/mm.min), while there was only a 45% inhibition in volume absorption (P less than 0.01) due to cellular cystine loading in the presence of 1 mM lumen and bath ATP (0.94 +/- 0.05 to 0.52 +/- 0.11 nl/mm.min). These data demonstrate that proximal tubule cellular cystine loading decreases cellular ATP concentration, but does not directly inhibit NaK ATPase activity. The inhibition in transport and decrease in intracellular ATP due to cellular cystine loading was ameliorated by exogenous ATP. These data are consistent with cellular ATP depletion playing a major role in the inhibition of proximal tubule transport due to intracellular cystine loading.\r"

  ".W": "Kidneys have long been recognized as a major source of plasminogen activators (PAs). However, neither the sites of synthesis of the enzymes nor their role in renal function have been elucidated. By the combined use of zymographies on tissue sections and in situ hybridizations, we have explored the cellular distribution of urokinase-type (u-PA) and tissue-type (t-PA) plasminogen activators and of their mRNAs in developing and adult mouse kidneys. In 17.5-d old embryos, renal tubules synthesize u-PA, while S-shaped bodies produce t-PA. In the adult kidney, u-PA is synthesized and released in urine by the epithelial cells lining the straight parts of both proximal and distal tubules. In contrast, t-PA is produced by glomerular cells and by epithelial cells lining the distal part of collecting ducts. The precise segmental distribution of PAs suggests that both enzymes may be implicated in the maintenance of tubular patency, by catalyzing extracellular proteolysis to prevent or circumvent protein precipitation.\r"

  ".W": "When assessed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2-D3)-receptor (VDR) binding analysis or 1,25(OH)2-D3-VDR-directed bioresponsiveness, cultured cells from some New World primates (platyrrhines) demonstrate a variable decrement in VDR when compared with Old World primate (catarrhine) cells. To study this difference in VDR expression among primates, we performed immunoblot analysis of the VDR in cultured dermal fibroblasts from platyrrhines in the genera Pithecia and Aotus and from catarrhines in the genus Presbytis; although a platyrrhine, the owl monkey (Aotus) expresses a VDR of the catarrhine (wild type) phenotype. Despite a 10-fold difference in the content of VDR by ligand binding analysis among cells from the three prototypic primate genera, there was a less than or equal to 10% difference in the steady-state level of 50-kD VDR detected by immunoblot analysis of cellular extracts. We investigated this apparent discrepancy in the content of VDR in immunoblots and ligand binding analyses by mixing VDR-containing nuclear extracts of equivalent protein concentration from the various primates. Coincubation of Pithecia and Aotus fibroblast extracts with Presbytis extract diminished specific 1,25(OH)2-D3 binding in the mix by 90% and 95% respectively. Similar results were obtained by mixing nuclear extracts of the owl monkey cell line, OMK, and the vitamin D resistant marmoset B-lymphoblast cell line B95-8. A wild type 1,25(OH)2-D3-binding profile was restored in mixtures after trypsin or heat treatment of the B95-8 extract. These data indicate that some New World primate cells contain a soluble protein that prevents intracellular 1,25(OH)2-D3-VDR binding. It is possible that the quantitative differences in the expression of this protein are responsible for 1,25(OH)2-D3 and other steroid hormone resistant states of variable severity in New World primates.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized placebo-controlled study, seven patients with acute myocardial infarction allocated to intravenous treatment with 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and seven patients allocated to placebo were studied during eight sampling periods before and after treatment. Seven patients with acute myocardial infarction treated intravenously with 1.5 million U of streptokinase were later studied during two sampling periods before and after treatment. The placebo group showed no significant deviations of endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity (p greater than 0.05). In the rt-PA group, this activity decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) after the infusion and remained depressed throughout the 1st 4 days. A significant decrease in activity (p less than 0.05) was also found in the streptokinase-treated patients. The depletion of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity was not due to generation of inhibition or a depletion of factor XII, prekallikrein and plasminogen, but could be related to the proactivator of this system. It is concluded that rt-PA (and streptokinase) treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction causes a prolonged depletion of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity. This depression of endogenous fibrinolytic activity needs to be evaluated in relation to the enhanced risk of coronary reocclusion after thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Pre-operative histological diagnosis had a very high sensitivity but a low specificity, indicating that false positives are common but false negatives unusual. Twenty per cent of patients with a recurrent primary tumour were untreatable. The five year survival after a primary recurrence was 31 per cent. Sixty-eight per cent of patients undergoing major surgery recovered without a major complication, and the hospital mortality rate was three per cent, due entirely to major medical catastrophes. The major complication rate in those undergoing flap repair after major resection was seven per cent. The metastatic rate in lymph nodes was 44 per cent at five years, and again this did not depend on any host or tumour factors. The survival at five years after node recurrence was a mere 19 per cent, and the length of survival was related to the primary site of the original tumour and the presence of extranodal disease. Two-thirds of patients had advanced disease (N2 and N3) when node recurrence was diagnosed and about 15 per cent were unsuitable for surgery.\r"

This circle-modified Bain breathing circuit was studied to evaluate whether it reduces fresh gas flow requirements. The Bain and modified Bain steady states were analyzed by mechanical and computer modeling. The mechanical model consisted of an artificial lung ventilated to steady state. Carbon dioxide was measured with capnography. Computer modeling was by compartmental analysis calculated with spread-sheet software. Steady-state solutions were obtained by numeric analysis. The circle-modified Bain greatly reduced retention of carbon dioxide. For example, with 1-liter tidal volumes, 10-liter minute volumes (10 breaths per minute), and a 2.1 L/min fresh gas flow, the steady-state end-tidal carbon dioxide values of the Bain and modified Bain were 9.3 and 4.6%, respectively, in the physical model (carbon dioxide inflow of 230 ml/min). Results from the mechanical model helped validate the computer model.\r"

The authors studied a cohort of hospitalized persons with AIDS to determine the proportion and characteristics of AIDS patients who could appropriately be cared for in long-term care facilities with skilled nursing. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical wards of five Seattle tertiary care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 120 consecutive hospitalized persons with AIDS and their primary care physicians, nurses, and social workers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Appropriateness for long-term care was determined by the patients' physicians, nurses, and social workers. Persons with AIDS who were appropriate for long-term care constituted 32% of the cohort (38 of 120), accounting for 35% of hospital days (11 of these 38 were discharged to long-term care facilities). Four admission characteristics were independently related to appropriateness: impaired activities of daily living, diagnosis of central nervous system illness or poor cognition, living alone, and weight loss. A discriminant function correctly classified over 80% of patients for appropriateness and was developed into a predictive index for planning patient care (sensitivity = 0.74, specificity = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that one-third of hospitalized persons with AIDS may be appropriate for care in long-term care settings, accounting for one-third of the days AIDS patients currently spend in hospitals. These patients can be identified early in hospital stays using a simple predictive index at the bedside.\r"

DESIGN: A system of 100 diagnosis clusters was developed based on retrospective review of computerized problem lists of patients from a university practice, and then applied to the problem lists of patients in a community practice. Chart review of a 5% random sample (n = 184) of university practice patients who had problem lists was carried out to assess the accuracy of the computerized problem lists. SETTING: A university ambulatory medicine practice and a community ambulatory medicine practice. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: For the same one-year period, all 4,490 patients seen in the university practice and all 1,294 patients seen two or more times in the community practice. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 27,634 problems listed for university patients and the 5,648 problems listed for community patients, 22,629 (82%) and 4,924 (87%), respectively, were assigned to diagnosis clusters. For the university and community practices, the mean numbers of problems per patient were 6.1 (SD 5.4) and 4.4 (SD 3.7), and the mean numbers of diagnosis clusters per patient were 4.5 (SD 3.7) and 3.6 (SD 3.0), respectively. Among the ten most common diagnosis clusters in both practices were HYPERTENSION, SYMPTOM OR SIGN, OBESITY, and DIABETES. Only 18% (SD 3%) of patient problem lists in the university practice omitted one or more chronic, important medical problems (e.g., hypertension, dementia, COPD). CONCLUSIONS: This system of diagnosis clusters effectively and efficiently described the clinical content of two types of internal medicine practices, and has important applications in medical education, epidemiology, clinical and health services research, and public policy.\r"

Infection was documented by positive virus culture. Results with the polymerase chain reaction were used for comparison. Twelve infants were found infected with HIV-1; the earliest age at which cultures became positive ranged from birth to 31 weeks of age. Of the 12 culture-positive infants, 10 had anti-HIV IgA antibodies detectable initially between birth (cord blood) and 27 weeks of age. Anti-HIV IgA was not present in the uninfected infants or in the control subjects, either by Western blot or dot blot assays. Testing for anti-HIV IgA antibodies with recombinant HIV-1 proteins is an effective method for detecting viral infection in newborn and young infants.\r"

Two acute tests were performed in which plasma calcium, phosphate, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (intact molecule), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), and 1,25-(OH)2D levels were measured: the first after an oral phosphate load (20 mg/kg) was administered after calcitriol had been discontinued for 10 days, and the second after a calcitriol load (0.03 microgram/kg) plus the same phosphate load but with the children receiving the usual combination treatment. There were no significant differences in basal levels of calcium, phosphate, iPTH, 25-OHD, or 1,25-(OH)2D between the two tests, nor were delta percent calcium and 25-OHD values significantly different. The delta percent plasma phosphate concentration at 60 minutes was significantly higher during test 2 than during test 1 (p less than 0.01) and delta percent iPTH concentration at 60 minutes was significantly higher during test 1 than during test 2 (p less than 0.01). In test 2 the iPTH level returned to baseline at 180 minutes. Higher delta percent 1,25-(OH)2D values at 60 minutes were observed in test 2 than in test 1 (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, the delta percent 1,25-(OH)2D levels were still higher at 180 minutes in test 2 than during test 1 (p less than 0.01). Our study indicates that oral calcitriol has an inhibitory effect on iPTH secretion in the hours immediately after oral phosphate administration in children with vitamin D-resistant rickets.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human interferon gamma enhances neutrophil respiratory burst and bactericidal activity in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Mononuclear leukocytes of patients with the hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome (Job syndrome) produce low or undetectable levels of this lymphokine. For these reasons we have restudied neutrophil chemotaxis in a group of our patients with the syndrome and determined the effect of recombinant human interferon gamma on the responses. Each of the patients had neutrophil chemotactic responses ranging from 22% to 55% of simultaneous control values (p less than 0.001). After incubation with interferon gamma, a significant improvement in chemotactic responsiveness was observed in the neutrophils of each of the patients (mean 301% of baseline chemotaxis; p less than 0.008). These data suggest the need for a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of interferon gamma in a larger group of patients with the syndrome of hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and recurrent infections.\r"

  ".W": "We report our experience with the use of tissue plasminogen activator to treat 12 infants and children with various thromboembolic states after conventional thrombolytic agents had failed. The dosage range was between 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg per hour. Complete clot dissolution occurred in seven cases after 2 hours to 3 days of therapy. Partial clot dissolution and clinical improvement were noted in another four patients. Bleeding complications were noted in 6 of the 12 patients and included bruising, oozing from various venipuncture sites, and bleeding; these complications were controlled by clinically available means. In all cases with bleeding the dose rate was in the higher range (0.46 to 0.50 mg/kg per hour). In one patient, restlessness, agitation, and screaming were noted during administration of tissue plasminogen activator and when it was reinstituted. We conclude that tissue plasminogen activator is effective in inducing clot lysis in children. Because the effective dose appears to overlap with those causing bleeding, we recommend that a dose of 0.1 mg/kg per hour be started and increased gradually if clot dissolution does not occur, with close monitoring for bleeding.\r"

  ".U": "91155413\r", 
  ".W": "The present study was designed to clarify how atrial appendectomy affects hemodynamics and secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide in the failing heart. Eleven mongrel dogs were prepared for the experimental model of high-output heart failure by creation of arteriovenous fistulas between femoral arteries and veins. Two months after the first operation, effects of bilateral atrial appendectomies on basal and pacing-induced secretions of atrial natriuretic polypeptide were investigated in five dogs with simultaneous measurement of various hemodynamic indices. In the remaining six dogs, used as a control group, pacing-induced secretion of atrial natriuretic polypeptide was examined in the same way as in the appendectomy group. After excision of the atrial appendages, neither systolic blood pressure nor either atrial pressure changed, but plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide level was decreased (292 +/- 54 to 188 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and cardiac output fell (3.7 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 0.8 L/min, p less than 0.01). During pacing-induced tachycardia, the peak level of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide was lower in the appendectomy group than in the control groups (593 +/- 213 versus 1170 +/- 324 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), despite similar left atrial pressures in the two groups. The excised appendages contained approximately 30% of the total amount of atrial natriuretic polypeptide. These results demonstrate that atrial appendectomy decreases secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide and reduces cardiac output in dogs with experimental high-output heart failure.\r"

Comparison of the sequence with that of the equivalent gene from the P1.7,16 reference strain reveals a point mutation which generates a single aminoacid change in the epitope responsible for P1.16 specificity. Monoclonal antibodies with P1.16 specificity do not react with synthetic peptides that correspond to the altered epitope, and do not promote complement-mediated bactericidal killing of the isolate.

  ".W": "In an attempt to replace the existing, DNA-based, 50% effective, carrier and prenatal diagnoses of haemophilia A with the 100% successful direct detection of defective genes, a new procedure was developed to screen and identify mutations in all the essential regions of the factor VIII gene (putative promoter, coding sequence, and the cleavage and polyadenylation region). Genomic DNA and cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of the \"leaky\" mRNA found in peripheral lymphocytes were amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction to yield a set of eight segments comprising the essential gene sequences. The segments were then screened individually for mutations by the amplification mismatch detection method, which detects and locates any type of sequence discrepancy between the test DNA and the control probe by cleavage of the probe at the site of mismatches. Two haemophilia A patients were studied. The first showed two single-base changes: one (substitution of tryptophan 2229 by cysteine in the C2 domain) is the probable cause of the disease, since it affects a conserved residue of factor VIIIa, whereas the other (the conservative substitution of aspartic acid at position 1241 by glutamic acid) occurs in a domain (B) irrelevant to factor VIII activity. The second patient showed a complete failure of pre-mRNA splicing due to a single-base substitution that changes the obligatory AG acceptor splice site of intron 5 to GG. The method characterises the gene defect in 10 days or less and should lead to the rapid accumulation of information on the molecular biology of haemophilia A.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The invasion and destruction of nonnecrotic muscle fibers by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells is considered a hallmark of polymyositis. In the cases of polymyositis reported so far, the autoinvasive CD8+ T cells expressed the common form of T-cell receptor for the recognition of antigen, the so-called alpha/beta T-cell receptor. We describe a 69-year-old man with polymyositis mediated by CD4-, CD8- T cells expressing the recently discovered, uncommon gamma/delta T-cell receptor. METHODS. We used immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase techniques to study frozen sections of muscle from our patient, who had mild weakness of cervical and proximal limb muscles, and from control patients with polymyositis, inclusion-body myositis, dermatomyositis, or granulomatous myopathy with monoclonal antibodies against T-cell-related antigens (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, and gamma/delta T-cell receptor), B cells (CD22), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and MHC-related antigens (MHC Class I, CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c), and the 65-kd heat-shock protein. The membrane contacts between the autoinvasive cells and the sarcolemma were investigated by electron microscopy. RESULTS. In the patient described here, but not in 28 others with inflammatory myopathies, myriad gamma/delta T cells surrounded and invaded nonnecrotic muscle fibers. All muscle fibers were highly reactive for MHC Class I antigen and the 65-kd heat-shock protein. Treatment with prednisone improved the clinical and histologic findings. CONCLUSIONS. Polymyositis can be mediated by gamma/delta T cells. This new form of polymyositis appears to be highly responsive to steroids.\r"

  ".W": "Host defence and inflammatory responses are controlled and amplified by receptor-mediated events often initiated by a chemotactic factor that directs the approach of phagocytic cells. Complement receptors CR1 and CR3 are responsible for the phagocytic and adhesive properties of neutrophils, whereas the C5a receptor mediates the pro-inflammatory and chemotactic actions of the complement anaphylatoxin C5a. In addition to stimulating chemotaxis, granule enzyme release and superoxide anion production, this receptor stimulates upregulation of expression and activity of the adhesion molecule MAC-1, and of CR1, and a decrease in cell-surface glycoprotein 100MEL-14 on neutrophils. In vivo, the C5a receptor may participate in anaphylactoid and septic shock. The human C5a receptor was cloned from U937 and HL-60 cells and identified by high affinity binding when expressed in COS-7 cells. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the receptor reveals the expected motifs befitting its interaction with cellular GTP-binding proteins.\r"

  ".U": "91156050\r", 
  ".W": "The onset of olfactory transduction has been extensively studied, but considerably less is known about the molecular basis of olfactory signal termination. It has been suggested that the highly active cytochrome P450 monooxygenases of olfactory neuroepithelium are termination enzymes, a notion supported by the identification and molecular cloning of olfactory-specific cytochrome P450s (refs. 13-16). But as reactions catalysed by cytochrome P450 (refs 17, 18) often do not significantly alter volatility, lipophilicity or odour properties, cytochrome P450 may not be solely responsible for olfactory signal termination. In liver and other tissues, drug hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 is frequently followed by phase II biotransformation, for example by UDP glucuronosyl transferase (UGT), resulting in a major change of solubility and chemical properties. We report here the molecular cloning and expression of an olfactory-specific UGT. The olfactory enzyme, but not the one in liver microsomes, shows preference for odorants over standard UGT substrates. Furthermore, glucuronic acid conjugation abolishes the ability of odorants to stimulate olfactory adenylyl cyclase. This, together with the known broad spectrum of drug-detoxification enzymes, supports a role for olfactory UGT in terminating diverse odorant signals.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight consecutive patients with neuralgia after peripheral nerve injury were treated with one or two series of peripheral local anesthetic blocks. All patients experienced an initial total relief of ongoing pain for 4-12 h. Evoked pain (hyperalgesia or allodynia), which occurred in 17 patients, was blocked simultaneously with the spontaneous pain. In 18 patients the analgesia outlasted the conduction block and there was a period of complete pain relief of 12-48 h in 13 patients and of 2-6 days in the other 5. In 8 patients there was a second phase of analgesia of 4 h to 6 days duration occurring within 12 h of pain recurrence. Thus, mono- or biphasic prolonged complete analgesia occurred in 25 out of 38 patients. A prolonged analgesia may be the result of a central action of the local anesthetic at the spinal level after intra-axonal incorporation and centripetal axoplasmic transport. To test this hypothesis, an experimental study with [3H]lidocaine was performed in 6 rats. The radioactive local anesthetic was injected into one hind limb foot with the other side serving as a control. Tissue samples from the peripheral nerve, nerve root and the lumbosacral spinal cord segment were analyzed for radioactivity using a scintillation counter technique at various time intervals after the [3H]lidocaine injection. There was a low grade of activity in all samples and no difference between the test side and the control side. Thus these experiments provided no evidence in support of this hypothesis. Various alternative peripheral and central mechanisms are discussed. Further studies specifically directed to these alternatives and with longitudinal controls are prompted.\r"

Ras proteins are bound to the inner face of the plasma membrane by their C-terminal extremity and are thought to transmit their mitogenic signals via an \"effector\" domain spanning amino acids 32-42. Two ras-related human genes rap1A and rap1B encode 95% homologous 21-kDa proteins that share with Ras p21 the same effector domain and a similar C-terminal Cys-Ali-Ali-Xaa sequence (where Ali is an aliphatic amino acid; also known as a CAAX sequence). The product of the rap1A gene is identical to that of the Krev-1 cDNA, whose overexpression is capable of reverting the phenotype of Ki-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Antibodies that do not cross-react with Ras and other Ras-related proteins were obtained by immunizing rabbits with a peptide encompassing residues 121-137 of Rap1 proteins. These antibodies were used to investigate the subcellular localization of Rap1 proteins by indirect immunofluorescence and fractionation techniques. Rap1 proteins were found to be tightly bound to cellular membranes. They did not colocalize with Ras proteins on the plasma membrane and were discovered to be associated with the Golgi complex.\r"

This gene conversion process was also seen in the related species Drosophila erecta. Specifically, there is virtual sequence identity between the coding regions of the two genes within each species, while the sequence divergence between species is close to that expected based on their phylogenetic relationship. The flanking, noncoding regions are much more highly diverged and do not appear to be subject to gene conversion. Comparison of amylase sequences between the two species provides a clear demonstration that recurrent gene conversion does indeed lead to the concerted evolution of the gene pair.\r"

In this study, we analyzed the 5' flanking sequences of the human PDGF A-chain gene to seek elements important to regulating its transcription. The promoter region was exceptionally G + C-rich and contained a \"TATA box\" but no \"CAAT box.\" The transcription start site was identified 845 base pairs 5' to the translation initiation site by S1 nuclease mapping and by primer extension. Both in vitro transcription and transient expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene linked to the PDGF A-chain 5' flanking sequences established that the putative promoter region was active, and RNase H mapping established that the three characteristic mRNAs (1.9, 2.3, and 2.8 kilobases) used the same transcription start site, which was used in normal endothelial cells and in two human tumor cell lines that express high levels of A-chain transcripts. The results established an exceptionally G + C-rich promoter region and a single transcription start site active for each of the three mRNAs of the PDGF A-chain gene. DNA sites of potential importance in mediating the activation of the PDGF A-chain gene in normal cells and in transformed cell lines expressing high levels of PDGF A chain were identified.\r"

  ".U": "91156674\r", 
  ".W": "Pituitary growth hormone (GH) functions physiologically to oppose the actions of insulin on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by interfering with metabolic events that occur after insulin binds to its receptor. Which postreceptor effects are involved is presently unknown. Recently, we found that insulin rapidly stimulates a phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) in adipose tissue of obese (ob/ob) mice and that this effect of insulin is blocked by treatment of the animals with S-carboxymethylated human GH (RCM-hGH), a derivative having mainly anti-insulin activity. The activation of this PI-PLC by insulin is also inhibited by pertussis toxin. Thus, this study was performed to examine whether the inhibitory effect of GH on the activation of this PI-PLC is exerted at the level of signal transmission by guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins). We found that the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, stimulated basal PI-PLC activity in plasma membranes of adipose tissue of saline-treated ob/ob mice, but it did not stimulate the enzyme in adipose membranes from RCM-hGH-treated mice. Also, RCM-hGH treatment markedly inhibited pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of G protein alpha subunits in the membranes, suggesting some modification of the G proteins by GH. Immunoblot analysis of adipose membranes from saline- and RCM-hGH-treated mice using antiserum AS/7 (anti-Gi1 alpha and anti-Gi2 alpha) or antiserum EC/2 (anti-Gi3 alpha) showed no difference in the amount of Gi alpha-like protein between the groups. These findings suggest that GH interferes with the ability of a putative Gi-like protein to mediate the activation of PI-PLC in adipose membranes without altering the expression of the G protein.\r"

These data differentiate HCV from the flaviviruses and indicate a closer evolutionary relationship of HCV with the pestiviruses. However, HCV also appears to be substantially different from other known pestiviruses. These data are consistent with the assignment of HCV to a separate viral genus.\r"

The AlgR1 protein is purified as a monomer, and the sequence of the nine N-terminal amino acids of the monomer matches with that predicted from the DNA sequence of the algR1 gene. The purified AlgR1 protein binds to two separate DNA fragments of the algD upstream region. DNase protection experiments identify these two DNA segments as 14-mer sequences centered at -382 and -458 regions, which contain a common CCGT-TCGTC sequence in them. While the presence of at least one AlgR1 binding site is important for the activation of the algD promoter, the presence of both of the binding sites in the upstream region leads to a higher level of activation.\r"

Moreover, these data are consistent with there being two additional steps leading to the maturation of G proteins: (i) association with and transport on intracellular organelles and (ii) modification at the time of transfer to the plasmalemma resulting in a molecular weight shift. Since the other two components of G protein-mediated signal transduction pathways, receptors and effector enzymes, are known to be delivered to the synaptic terminals by fast axonal transport, our findings introduce the possibility that these three macromolecules are assembled as a complex in the cell body and delivered together to the plasma membrane of the axon and synaptic terminals.\r"

However, the gene encoding APP is expressed widely in normal human tissues and in adult and fetal mouse tissues and is alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific pattern in the adult. There is evidence that APP may function as a growth factor and as a mediator of cell adhesion and in these roles could be important in morphogenesis. As a step toward determining the role of APP in development and in determining how the adult pattern of tissue-specific splicing is established, we have used reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction to demonstrate APP expression in mouse oocytes, preimplantation embryos, and postimplantation embryonic stages to the late embryonic period. All three splicing forms described in mouse were present at each stage, although there were changes in the ratios of the splicing forms at different stages. Screens for APP clones in embryonic cDNA libraries from the egg cylinder stage and the early somite stage were used to confirm the results of the polymerase chain reaction, and APP clone abundance was found to increase 10-fold between the two stages.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide (EDRF/NO) synthesized by bovine aortic endothelial cells and subcellular fractions thereof was assayed by its stimulating effect on soluble guanylyl cyclase of rat fetal lung fibroblasts (RFL-6 cells). The release of EDRF/NO by intact endothelial cells could be stimulated with bradykinin, thrombin, or ADP and was abolished in Ca2(+)-free medium. When subcellular fractions were analyzed, some EDRF/NO-synthesizing activity was found in the cytosolic fraction, but most of the activity was associated with the particulate fraction. Both enzyme activities required L-arginine and NADPH for EDRF/NO synthesis, both were inhibited by NG-nitro-L-arginine and NG-methyl-L-arginine, and hemoglobin or methylene blue abolished the effect of the EDRF/NO produced by both enzymes. Both enzymes were highly sensitive to Ca2+; the major increase in activity occurred between 100 and 500 nM free Ca2+. Exposure of the particulate enzyme activity to 1 M KCl removed 39% of the protein and reduced total activity by 46%, but the activity was restored when exogenous calmodulin (CaM) was added. Further KCl washes caused little further loss of protein or EDRF/NO synthase activity. The KCl-washed particulate enzyme could be solubilized with the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. The CaM antagonists calmidazolium and trifluoperazine as well as the CaM-binding protein calcineurin inhibited the EDRF/NO synthesis by both the cytosolic and the particulate enzyme. These effects were partially reversed with exogenous CaM. Partial purification of the cytosolic and solubilized particulate enzymes by affinity chromatography on adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate-Sepharose resulted in EDRF/NO synthase activities dependent on exogenous CaM. We conclude that endothelial cells contain both cytosolic and particulate enzymes that synthesize EDRF/NO. Both enzymes are regulated by free Ca2+ and, at least in part, by CaM.\r"

The effects of morinda on various fitness traits of these two species, their F1 hybrids, and reciprocal backcrosses were analyzed. Morinda fruit is highly toxic to Drosophila species, except D. sechellia. The toxicity is expressed in adults, embryos, and larvae. In embryos, early mortality is a maternally inherited trait, depending only on mother's genotype. The tolerance of D. sechellia to morinda is fully dominant in F1 hybrids. Egg production is stimulated by morinda in D. sechellia but inhibited in D. simulans; in hybrids, the inhibition observed in D. simulans is dominant. Morinda is an oviposition attractant for D. sechellia but a repellent for D. simulans; F1 hybrids and backcross individuals exhibit intermediate, approximately additive, behavior. In the field, adult flies of the two species exhibit opposite behavior in that D. sechellia is attracted to morinda and D. simulans is attracted to banana; hybrids have an intermediate behavior. These differences between the species explain why they do not hybridize in nature although living in sympatry. The various traits have different genetic bases: three or four different genes, or groups of genes, differentiate the ecological niches of the two species.\r"

A P. aeruginosa Sal- mutant was incubated with 13 salicylic acid analogues and was found to incorporate three (5-fluorosalicylic acid, 4-methylsalicylic acid, and 3-hydroxypicolinic acid) into pyochelin analogues, trivially designated as 5-fluoropyochelin, 4-methylpyochelin, and 6-azapyochelin. The structures of the mutasynthetic products were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR and high-resolution fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry as being identical to pyochelin except for the expected changes in the aromatic ring. The biological activity of the three pyochelin analogues was determined in iron transport assays. In comparison to pyochelin, 4-methylpyochelin was more active in the assays whereas the activities of 5-fluoropyochelin and 6-azapyochelin were markedly decreased.

Receptor-independent activation of each Drosophila Gs alpha has demonstrated that both forms are capable of activating mammalian adenylyl cyclase and thus have the activity expected of stimulatory G proteins. However, the Drosophila Gs alpha subunits interact poorly with mammalian Gs-coupled receptors. These observations have helped to identify a region of high variability in Gs alpha proteins that may be important for receptor interactions.\r"

In vitro, FK 506 binds and inhibits the activity of FK 506-binding protein (FKBP), a peptidylprolyl rotamase (cis-trans isomerase). Cyclosporin A acts similarly on a different proline rotamase, cyclophilin. Experiments described here demonstrate genetically that FKBP is a target for FK 506 in vivo. We have isolated the gene encoding the FKBP proline rotamase (FPR1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The encoded yeast protein is highly homologous with bovine and human FKBP and shares no homology with cyclophilin. Disruption of FPR1 and CPR1 (encoding cyclophilin) individually or in combination is not lethal; thus, either enzymatic proline rotamerization is not essential for life or an unknown proline rotamase can substitute for the missing enzymes. Overexpression or disruption of FPR1 confers resistance to growth inhibition by FK 506, suggesting that FKBP is a target for FK 506 in yeast. However, FKBP is only one of at least two targets because strains lacking FKBP are only partially resistant to FK 506.\r"

  ".W": "The versatility and importance of macrophages in host defense and homeostasis have long been recognized. Anatomically, macrophages isolated from various tissues manifest extreme differences in shape, in metabolic and functional activities, and in the expression of macrophage-specific markers. To determine the mechanisms responsible for generating macrophage heterogeneity, we have employed the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to molecularly phenotype colonies of bone marrow-derived macrophages during differentiation in vitro. By utilizing this method, results have revealed a hierarchal expression of macrophage-associated genes. Tumor necrosis factor alpha was expressed in all colonies analyzed suggesting an important role for this molecule during macrophage differentiation. Predominant colony phenotypes observed were unique for (i) the period of differentiation and (ii) the growth factor with which they were derived (either colony-stimulating factor 1 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). Exogenous stimulation of the cultures with either bacterial lipopolysaccharide or interferon-gamma led to predictable phenotypic transitions. These results suggest that macrophage heterogeneity is generated through differentiation-related mechanisms and that generated macrophage phenotypes are then maintained by systemic environmental constraints.\r"

  ".W": "Contrasting data exist about a possible modulation of the autonomic function by atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in human beings, particularly at low, biologically, significant concentrations. We have evaluated that possibility by increasing plasma ANF levels through the infusion of a synthetic analogue (WY-47,663, anaritide) in five male patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension. Nonhypotensive lower body negative pressure (-10 mm Hg x 5 min) was used to selectively deactivate cardiopulmonary receptors and to stimulate sympathetic efferent tone reflexogenically. ANF was given at either a low rate (0.005 micrograms/kg/min x 60 min, which was previously shown to increase plasma ANF in a range compatible with physiologic stimuli) or at a high rate (0.05 micrograms/kg/min x 60 min, each). Administration of ANF was preceded and followed by vehicle infusion (Haemacell x 30 min). Forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography), intraarterial blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored continuously, and venous immunoreactive ANF, plasma renin activity, aldosterone level, and venous hematocrit were measured at the end of both control and infusion periods. Arterial norepinephrine values, an indirect index of sympathetic discharge, were measured at rest and during lower body negative pressure conditions. Graded systemic ANF infusion increased immunoreactive ANF and venous hematocrit, decreased aldosterone level and plasma renin activity, whereas resting norepinephrine levels, blood pressure, and heart rate did not change. Lower body negative pressure decreased forearm blood flow during vehicle infusion, but it lost its vasoconstrictor effect during infusion of ANF. To identify the site of that inhibitory action, ANF was also infused into the brachial artery at rates that raised local but not systemic levels of immunoreactive ANF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the risk and possible benefits of use of the percutaneous IABP in patients given thrombolytic therapy as treatment for acute myocardial infarction, we prospectively evaluated 810 consecutive patients entered into the TAMI trials. During hospitalization the 85 patients treated with the IABP had more cardiac risk factors, were slightly older (58 vs 56 years), and more often had anterior infarction (62% vs 38%). At acute cardiac catheterization, patients treated with the IABP also had more multivessel coronary disease (67% vs 43%), more frequent TIMI grade 0 or 1 flow (44% vs 28%), lower global ejection fraction (40% vs 52%), and worse regional infarct (-3.2 vs -2.5 SD/chord) and noninfarct (-0.67 vs +0.36 SD/chord) zone function. Although mortality rates (32% vs 4%) and in-hospital complications were greater in patients treated with the IABP, a greater improvement in global (delta ejection fraction: +1.9% vs +0.7%) and noninfarct zone (delta SD/chord: +0.11 vs -0.09) left ventricular function was observed in patients treated with the IABP at 1-week follow-up angiography. In addition, no reinfarction or reocclusion of the infarct-related artery occurred while patients were being treated with the IABP. These results suggest that the IABP may have a specific role after thrombolytic therapy in treating patients at high risk for reocclusion or at high risk for hemodynamic deterioration because of large infarction or critical stenoses in coronary vessels supplying the noninfarct zone.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether undernourished elderly patients are at increased risk for mortality, independent of nonnutritional factors affecting outcomes, 109 patients were evaluated at admission to a geriatric rehabilitation unit (GRU) and then followed prospectively for 1 y after hospital discharge. During the interval of observation, 33 (30%) patients died, 11 before hospital discharge and 22 within the year subsequent to discharge. Of the 81 nutritional and nonnutritional variables analyzed, the best predictor of mortality, as determined by stepwise-discriminant-function analysis, within 1 y of hospital discharge was the percent of usual body weight lost in the year previous to admission, followed by the subscapular skinfold thickness and the discharge Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) score. Percent of weight lost was also the strongest predictor of 1-y post-GRU-admission mortality. These results provide compelling evidence for the importance of nutritional status in predicting both in-hospital and postdischarge mortality in a population of frail, male GRU patients.\r"
