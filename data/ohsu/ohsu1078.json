In the following hours a poisoning with glycolate and oxalate develops, with increasing acidosis, renal and brain damage. A patient admitted within a few hours of an overdose, with no or only slight metabolic acidosis, may be successfully treated with ethanol. If the serum concentration of ethylene glycol is very high, hemodialysis may be deferred until the necessary staff and equipment are available. If the patient is admitted with severe metabolic acidosis, hemodialysis must be started immediately. The need for ethanol administration during hemodialysis merits reevaluation.\r"

The source data used to determine the human toxicity of oil of citronella and the appropriate management of poisoning included a case report of a fatal ingestion of oil of citronella in a child. On scrutiny, however, the management of this poisoning included now out-moded techniques, giving rise to uncertainties in establishing the true cause of the child's death. Our own experiences indicate that advice given in standard texts based on poisoning cases managed with out-moded techniques should be carefully evaluated.\r"

Fifty-two percent reported that they asked older adults about children who could possibly ingest medications, and 59% reported that they had poison prevention material available. However, over 50% of pharmacists reported that they neither actively counseled nor handed out poison prevention material to the elderly, and only 9% reported that they specifically advise older adults about poison prevention. If all pharmacists targeted poison control education to the elderly, childhood poisoning by drugs could be reduced by one-third.\r"

Each study consisted of both a 30-minute basal period and a 4-hour experimental period during which insulin was infused at either 0.6, 1.2, 2.5, 5.0, 10, or 20 mU/kg/min with euglycemia maintained. Two protocols were used. In the first (I), subjects were allowed to develop hypoaminoacidemia, and in the second (II), plasma amino acid levels were maintained near basal by frequently monitoring plasma leucine levels in conjunction with exogenous infusion of an L-amino acid solution. The amount of amino acids infused were 0.85 +/- 0.11, 1.53 +/- 0.17, 1.97 +/- 0.13, 2.18 +/- 0.50, 2.78 +/- 0.61, and 2.83 +/- 0.44 mg/kg/min at escalating insulin doses, respectively. When amino acids were infused, the amount of glucose required to maintain euglycemia was lower at each insulin dose used (4.5 +/- 0.3 vs 3.6 +/- 0.4, 7.6 +/- 0.5 vs 6.9 +/- 0.3, 10.4 +/- 1.0 vs 8.7 +/- 0.5, 13.3 +/- 0.8 vs 10.2 +/- 0.4, 14.7 +/- 0.8 vs 11.7 +/- 0.6, and 14.9 +/- 0.6 vs 11.8 +/- 0.8 mg/kg/min at escalating insulin doses, respectively; p less than 0.05). The calculated maximal infusion rates were 15.8 +/- 0.6 vs 12.6 +/- 0.4 mg/kg/min (protocol I vs II, p less than 0.001), while the concentrations required to achieve half-maximal rates were 153 +/- 22 and 134 +/- 22 microU/ml (p = ns), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thermal trauma increased total, myofibrillar, and sarcoplasmic muscle protein synthesis (44%) and protein degradation (300%). Conversely, surgical trauma decreased synthesis of total (24%), myofibrillar (14%), and sarcoplasmic (43%) muscle proteins without altering protein degradation. Short-term restriction of pair-fed controls did not affect either aspect of protein turnover.\r"

The osmolality of two commercial glucose polymers was measured in reconstituted powder infant formulas, and the change in osmolality of infant milk formulas at the same increases in energy density (67 kcal/dL to 81 and 97 kcal/dL) from the use of additional milk powder or glucose polymers was compared. All samples were prepared from powders (to nearest 0.1 mg), and osmolality was measured by freezing point depression. For both glucose polymers the within-batch variability of the measured osmolality was less than 3.5%, and between-batch variability of the measured osmolality was less than 9.6%. The measured osmolality varies linearly with energy density (p less than 0.001) and was highest in infant formula reconstituted from milk powder alone. However, there exist significant differences in the measured osmolality between different glucose polymer preparations. At high energy densities (greater than or equal to 97 kcal/dL), infant milk formulas prepared with milk powder alone or with the addition of certain glucose polymer preparation may have high osmolality (greater than or equal to 450 mosm/kg) and theoretically predispose the infant to complications of hyperosmotic feeds.\r"

  ".U": "91269440\r", 
  ".W": "Fast-growing tumors are major glutamine consumers and may alter host glutamine metabolism to benefit the tumor. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the liver switches from an organ of glutamine balance to one of glutamine release with progressive malignant growth. However, the regulation of this change is unclear. This study examined tumor modulation of hepatic glutamine metabolism by determining the activities of glutaminase, the principle enzyme of glutamine degradation, and glutamine synthetase, the principal enzyme of glutamine synthesis. Hepatic glutamine content was also determined. Rats with a fast-growing subcutaneous fibrosarcoma (TBR) and pair-fed controls were studied at 2 and 3 weeks after tumor or sham implantation, when the tumors comprised approximately 5% and 20% of total body weight. Arterial glutamine fell with progressive tumor growth (608 +/- 26 mumol/L in controls vs 494 +/- 15 in TBR, p less than 0.005) and was not attributable to a diminished food intake. Hepatic glutamine content was increased 45% (p less than 0.01) in tumor rats at 2 weeks due in part to a 35% fall in liver glutaminase activity. At 3 weeks, glutamine synthetase activity increased by 43% (0.58 +/- 0.07 mumol/mg of protein/hr in controls vs 0.83 +/- 0.04 in TBR, p less than 0.01) whereas glutaminase remained depressed (2.68 +/- 0.12 mumol/mg of protein/hr in controls vs 2.22 +/- 0.15 in TBR, p less than 0.05) and glutamine content fell compared to 2 week tumor-bearing rats, consistent with accelerated hepatic glutamine release. Tumors may alter liver glutamine metabolism by modulating hepatic enzyme activity in order to provide circulating glutamine for the growing malignancy.\r"

Analyses indicated that acceptable reliability coefficients were obtained after 20 min of continuous data collection in the ventilated canopy and after 40 min with the face mask after a 5-min acclimation period. The results suggest that, following an acclimation period, a single 20-min assessment of resting energy expenditure in both a face mask and ventilated canopy are stable and reliable.\r"

UUN is assumed to constitute 80 to 90% of the total nitrogen output; when estimating TUN from UUN, UUN values are multiplied by 1.25 to correct for non-urea nitrogen components. In order to evaluate the validity of estimating total urinary nitrogen output from measured UUN in a clinical setting, 491 UUN:TUN paired studies were performed on 24-hour urine collections in general surgical/trauma patients who had measured TUN outputs ranging from 0.04 to 54.0 g/d. Assessment of 315 NB studies was done to compare NB values of those calculated by using UUN as an estimate of TUN with those calculated from measured TUN. Patients in both studies were subdivided into four stress categories, using TUN/day as the index: less than 5 g, 5-10 g, 10-15 g, and greater than 15 g. On average, 80 to 90% of TUN is represented by the UUN. However, in our patient population the variability ranged from 12 to 112%. If these UUN values are used as estimates for TUN in calculating NB, variations of up to 12 g/d would result. Application of the correction factor of 1.25 is not consistent in correcting for nonurea nitrogen components in this clinical setting. The use of actual rather than estimated TUN may be a more accurate and appropriate method than UUN when calculating NB.\r"

Unfortunately, many of the areas for which a relatively well-characterized response exists in adults are poorly documented in neonates. As is the case in adults, the response seems to be primarily catabolic in nature because the combined hormonal changes include an increased release of catabolic hormones such as catecholamines, glucagon, and corticosteroids coupled with a suppression of and peripheral resistance to the effects of the primary anabolic hormone, insulin.\r"

  ".W": "An increase in cytosolic calcium (Cai2+), induced by an increase in extracellular calcium concentration or addition of the calcium ionophore A23187, has been shown to suppress basal and AVP responsive cAMP and inhibit water flow in the collecting tubule. In the present study, the relationships between extracellular Na+ concentration, Cai2+, PGE2 and AVP-responsive cAMP production were examined in cultured rat papillary collecting tubule (RPCT) cells. Reducing extracellular Na+ concentration from 144 to 24 mM increased Cai2+ and PGE2 production approximately below 144 mM on Cai2+ or PGE2 was not due to a change in media osmolality or chloride concentration, since these parameters were maintained at constant levels by addition of tetramethylammonium chloride (TMA) or choline chloride. Exposure of RPCT cells to media containing 24 mM Na+ significantly suppressed basal and AVP responsive cAMP compared to that observed at 144 mM Na+. This suppression was mimicked by the calcium ionophore A23187 which also increased Cai2+ and PGE2. The increase in Cai2+ and PGE2 and the suppression of basal and AVP responsive cAMP, which were observed at 24 versus 144 mM Na+, were abolished in calcium free media and were likely due to influx of extracellular calcium. Indomethacin did not prevent the suppressive effects of reducing extracellular Na+ concentration below 144 mM on basal or AVP responsive cAMP, suggesting that the enhanced production of PGE2 did not mediate the reduction in AVP responsiveness. In contrast to cAMP, reductions in extracellular Na+ concentration from 144 to 24 mM did not influence basal cGMP or the cGMP responses to atrial natriuretic peptide or nitroprusside.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Eight groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 281 mg Al(OH)3/kg/day by gastric intubation five times a week for five weeks. Concurrently, animals in seven groups received ascorbic acid (56.3 mg/kg/day), citric acid (62 mg/kg/day), gluconic acid (62.7 mg/kg/day), lactic acid (28.8 mg/kg/day), malic acid (42.9 mg/kg/day), oxalic acid (28.8 mg/kg/day), and tartaric acid (48 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water. The eighth group did not receive any dietary constituent in the water and was designated as the control group. Animals were placed in plastic metabolic cages and urine was collected during the treatment period. The liver, spleen, kidney, brain and bone aluminum levels of each rat were measured, as well as the total amount of aluminum excreted into urine. All the dietary constituents significantly increased the aluminum concentrations in most of the tissues, with ascorbic and citric acids showing the highest rate of aluminum accumulation. In contrast, no significant differences between control and treated rats were observed in the concentrations of aluminum excreted into urine. In view of these results, we suggest that the effects of the simultaneous ingestion of aluminum hydroxide and those dietary constituents in uremic animals should be evaluated. Meanwhile, the diet of uremic patients should be carefully monitored.\r"

It is not known, however, whether aluminum inhibits the mineralization of bone directly or whether alterations in osteoblastic function mediate this response. To examine this issue, the uptake of 45Ca by 14-day embryonic chick calvaria was measured in vitro. Comparative studies were done in living and devitalized tissues to evaluate the role of bone cells in aluminum-related changes in 45Ca uptake. Aluminum was added to serum-free media as the citrate complex, and paired hemicalvaria maintained in equimolar sodium citrate served as controls. Aluminum citrate decreased the uptake of 45Ca into bone during 24 hour incubations to 76 +/- 3% and 38 +/- 2% (x +/- SD) of control values at 10 microM and 100 microM aluminum, respectively. No change in 45Ca uptake was observed at the end of four hour incubations with 100 microM aluminum citrate, whereas 45Ca uptake decreased from 356 +/- 48 to 266 +/- 36 cpm/micrograms bone, P less than 0.05, at eight hours and from 327 +/- 22 to 269 +/- 41 cpm/micrograms bone, P less than 0.05, at 24 hours. The inhibitory effects of 10 microM and 100 microM aluminum on 45Ca uptake were eliminated, however, in devitalized tissues, and reductions in 45Ca uptake during incubations with aluminum were markedly attenuated by lowering the media phosphorus level from 4.0 mM to 2.0 mM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Gram-negative bacterial sepsis is frequently associated with acute renal failure but the specific effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other bacterial products on kidney function are not known. Since either LPS or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)--a chemotactic peptide from bacterial cell walls--activate neutrophils (PMN) to release a number of potentially toxic factors in vitro, we determined the effect of adding PMN with LPS and/or FMLP to isolated perfused rat kidneys. Isolated rat kidneys perfused with LPS alone or LPS and normal PMN had normal glomerular filtration rates (GFR) and tubular Na reabsorption (TNa). Kidneys perfused with FMLP alone or FMLP and normal PMN also had normal GFR and TNa. In contrast, addition of PMN with both FMLP and LPS caused progressive renal dysfunction. For example, after 60 minutes of perfusion, GFR was reduced from 610 +/- 31 to 147 +/- 17 microliters/min/g and TNa from 97 +/- 1 to 72 +/- 2%, both P less than 0.01. Perfusion with the O2 metabolite scavengers catalase or dimethylthiourea afforded no protection while perfusion with the neutrophil elastase inhibitor Eglin C conferred substantial, but not complete, protection: GFR 492 +/- 34 microliters/min/g; TNa 91 +/- 3%. However, perfusion with both Eglin C and catalase completely prevented the toxic effects of LPS and FMLP-treated PMN on renal function. We conclude that in isolated kidneys, 1) the toxic effects of LPS requires FMLP-treated PMN and that 2) LPS and FMLP treated PMN cause progressive renal injury which is mediated by both O2 metabolites and neutrophil elastase.\r"

The purpose of the present series of experiments has been to analyze the functional relations between the effect of endothelin on renal function and glomerular and mesangial cell contraction and the production and actions of PAF in kidney. Endothelin 1 nmol/kg body wt induced a transient decrease of glomerular filtration rate (from 1.99 +/- 0.17 to 0.56 +/- 0.18 ml/min) and renal blood flow (from 10.8 +/- 1.3 to 2.7 +/- 0.3 ml/min). Endothelin also induced a marked reduction of planar cell surface area of cultured mesangial cells (30 +/- 5%) and of cross sectional area of isolated glomeruli (from 1.51 +/- 0.02 to 1.31 +/- 0.02 m2 x 10(-8]. BN-52021 or WEB-2170, two potent specific inhibitors of PAF receptor binding, blocked the effects of endothelin on renal function and on the contraction of isolated glomeruli and mesangial cells. In addition, endothelin induced a significant increase in the production of PAF by isolated glomeruli (Basal, 81 +/- 10 pg/mg protein; endothelin, 10(-7) M, 140 +/- 18 pg/mg protein). Endothelin also stimulated the incorporation of [3H]acetate into PAF, both in glomeruli (264.27 +/- 27.7%) and mesangial cells (251 +/- 41%). These effects were blocked by EGTA and by verapamil. Our results suggest that PAF may be a mediator of the effects of endothelin on renal function and glomerular and mesangial cell contraction.\r"

Renal morphology was similar without atrophy or fibrosis in one week CsA and OO and four week OO rats. Four week CsA rats had focal cortical interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Cortical procollagen alpha 1 (I) mRNA levels were increased in CsA versus OO rats at one week (P less than 0.02) and four weeks (P less than 0.02). One week medullary procollagen alpha 1 (I) and all other one week medullary, and one and four week cortical procollagen and beta-actin mRNA levels were no different in CsA versus OO rats. The early increase in renal cortical procollagen alpha 1 (I) mRNA levels precedes renal morphologic abnormalities, and may represent an important step in the pathogenesis of cyclosporine-induced renal cortical fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Gentamicin accumulates in proximal tubule lysosomes, increases their number, and changes their structure. An important lysosomal function is degradation of intracellular proteins. To evaluate the effect of gentamicin on this lysosomal function, we measured the activity of the key lysosomal proteinases, cathepsin B and L, in microdissected S1, S2, and S3 segments of rat proximal tubules by means of a fluorometric microassay. The cathepsin activities were decreased in S1 and S2 following one and four gentamicin injections of 100 mg/kg body weight. The lysosomal enzyme, acid phosphatase, was also measured and was not decreased by gentamicin. The urine excretion of cathepsins B and L was decreased after gentamicin. This excludes an increase in urinary loss of cathepsins as the cause of decreased tubule activity. Structural changes of the lysosomes per se were excluded as the factor responsible for the reduced cathepsin activity by demonstrating increased cathepsin B and L activity in proximal tubule segments from rats injected with dextran, since dextran induces an increase in number and size of proximal tubule lysosomes. In vitro incubation of urine and tubule segments with gentamicin demonstrated a concentration-dependent reversible inhibition of cathepsin B and L. We conclude that gentamicin per se decreased cathepsin B and L activities in proximal tubule segments as early as 24 hours following one injection due to either enzyme inhibition or reduced generation of active intralysosomal cathepsin B and L. Gentamicin may, therefore, reduce renal protein catabolism by decreasing the activity of the key proteolytic enzymes, cathepsin B and L. Since cathepsin B and L are proteolytic activators of other lysosomal enzymes, their reduced activity may also decrease the activities of other lysosomal enzymes.\r"

We studied the effect of a low iron diet, given to reduce hematocrit, on urinary protein excretion and glomerular function in male MWF/Ztm rats, which spontaneously develop proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis. At 20 weeks of age, micropuncture and glomerular volume measurements were performed in untreated rats fed standard chow and in rats fed an isocaloric diet with low iron (5 mg/kg) content. Two additional groups of rats were used for total kidney function and glomerular volume evaluation at 35 weeks of age. At 20 weeks of age animals on low iron diet showed significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced hematocrit (46 +/- 5% vs. 54 +/- 2%) and proteinuria (60 +/- 15 vs. 225 +/- 34 mg/24 hr) than control animals, and no statistically significant differences were observed in single nephron hemodynamics. At 35 weeks of age rats on low iron diet had significantly lower proteinuria than age matched controls (222 +/- 68 vs. 411 +/- 71 mg/24 hr, P less than 0.01) and developed less glomerular sclerosis (mean percentage of sclerotic glomeruli was respectively 14 +/- 7% and 31 +/- 17%, P less than 0.05). Glomerular volume was comparable in animals on the low iron diet and in controls both at 20 and 35 weeks of age.

  ".W": "The addition of 2 mM glycine to the recirculating perfusate of isolated perfused rat kidneys almost completely prevented the severe morphological injury to tubular cells lining the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) that normally develops in this preparation. Glycine was similarly effective in reducing mTAL injury associated with hypoxic perfusion, indomethacin and amphotericin. Fractional reabsorption of sodium was increased with glycine, without any change in perfusate flow to the whole kidney and without consistent improvement in GFR. L-alanine demonstrated a similar though less pronounced cytoprotective action, but glutamine, cysteine, glutamate, cysteine plus glutamate, 1-serine and 4-aminoisobutyric acid all had little or no effect in preventing severe mTAL injury. The protective effect of glycine was unimpaired by the arginine analogue NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA), suggesting that the endothelial-derived relaxing factor, NO, was not involved. The action of glycine was not reduced by the addition of a substrate (benzoate) or a product (hippurate) of the glycine N-acyltransferase reaction. Glycine did not depress the respiration of dispersed mTALs prepared from rat kidneys. The cytoprotective effect of glycine in the mTAL of perfused kidneys, shared with l-alanine, appears to be relatively specific for these amino acids and probably unrelated to a diminution in cell work.\r"

The middle layer (lamina densa) was composed of 6 to 10 nm fibrils which formed a meshwork structure. The space between the fibrils had polygonal shape. The average long dimension of the space between fibrils was 17 nm and the short one was 13 nm. At the outer layer (lamina rara externa), fibrils connected podocytes perpendicularly with the meshwork of the middle layer. At the inner layer (lamina rara interna), similar perpendicular fibrils also connected endothelial cells with the meshwork of the middle layer. This is the first report to visualize the three-dimensional meshwork structure of the middle layer (the lamina densa) in situ. The function of anchoring podocytes to the lamina densa was suggested in the perpendicularly arranged fibrils of the outer layer. The quick-freeze and deep-etch method is useful in analyzing filamentous ultrastructure in glomeruli, and will be applied to clarifying pathological ultrastructure in kidney diseases.\r"

  ".W": "When a transepithelial osmotic difference was imposed in perfused proximal straight tubules (270 mOsm/kg H2O in the lumen and 290 in the bath) in the absence of bath colloid, a severe vacuolation (appearance of lucent spaces) developed within the epithelium such that view of the lumen border was obscured within 5 +/- 1 min (N = 13 tubules at 23 degrees C). This vacuolation was less severe if the bath was hypotonic to the lumen or if the magnitude of the osmotic difference was reduced. If colloid (6% wt/vol of either bovine serum albumin or 70,000 molecular wt dextran) was included in the bathing medium, vacuolation was either not observed or was minimal, but became severe upon removal of the colloid and obscured the lumen within 6 +/- 1 min (N = 8 for albumin and N = 4 for dextran at 23 degrees C). At 38 degrees C, vacuolation obscured the lumen within 4 +/- 1 min following the removal of albumin (N = 5). ANOVA suggests that none of the times for vacuolation to occur differed. The rate of passive volume flow due to the osmotic difference was unaffected by vacuolation (0.9 +/- 0.1 nl.min-1.mm-1 with albumin to 0.8 +/- 0.1 without albumin and vacuolated, N = 8 at 23 degrees C, P greater than 0.2 using a paired t-test). Electron microscopic examination of tubules fixed after vacuolation showed lucent spaces within the cytoplasm. These results suggest that the presence of serosal colloid protected the epithelial cells from injury during rapid transepithelial water flow. The mechanism for this protective effect is not apparent, but may be related to effects of colloid in maintaining normal volume absorption in the proximal nephron.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the significance of mononuclear phagocytes in IgA nephropathy, renal biopsied materials from 45 patients with the disease were examined by the indirect immunoperoxidase method using anti-human monoclonal antibodies and by ultrastructural peroxidase (PO) cytochemistry. The monoclonal antibodies were FMC32, S-100 (alpha), My4, and LeuM5 for detection of mononuclear phagocytes and HLA-DR for Ia antigens. Mesangial hypercellularity in IgA nephropathy was divided into three grades. The number of monocyte/macrophages per glomerulus differed significantly among the grade of mesangial hypercellularity. In the capillary lumen, monocytes were more numerous in the group with slight mesangial hypercellularity. By contrast, macrophages were often found in the Bowman's space and mesangial area of the glomeruli in the advanced group. In the renal interstitium, the number of monocyte/macrophages per 100 interstitial cells differed significantly among the degree of interstitial damage, and they were observed mainly around sclerotic glomeruli. Ultrastructural PO cytochemistry revealed infiltration of monocytes, exudate macrophages, and/or PO-negative macrophages. Clinicopathological study showed a relationship between the number of monocyte/macrophages per glomerulus and the number of glomerular crescents and the degree of proteinuria. The constancy of the percentage of exudate macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were observed irrespective of the grade of mesangial hypercellularity. On the other hand, the increasing percentage of PO-negative macrophages and decreasing percentage of monocytes were observed over the grade. These results suggest that mononuclear phagocytes might play an important role in the pathogenesis of mesangial hypercellularity, and irreversible glomerular damage and interstitial tissue injury in IgA nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "Arginine-vasopressin (AVP), interacts with at least two types of receptors: V1 receptors which mediate the aggregating effects of AVP on human blood platelets and other AVP actions on vascular smooth muscle and hepatocytes; and V2 receptors which mediate the antidiuretic effects on renal tubules. Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is a rare X-linked disorder in humans with abnormal renal and extrarenal V2-receptor responses. However, the V1 receptor responses are apparently normal, since in these patients blood pressure increases in response to AVP. To assess V1 receptor responses, binding studies (3H-AVP) were done on intact platelets obtained from 6 male patients with CNDI, 10 normal subjects and 4 patients with autosomal dominant central diabetes insipidus (ADCDI). The affinity constant (0.68 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.06 nM) and the number of specific binding sites per platelet (101 +/- 6 vs. 86 +/- 12) were similar in the normal subjects and the patients with CNDI. However, the number of binding sites per platelet was increased in the patients with ADCDI (189 +/- 12). Platelet aggregation induced by AVP was equivalent in the three groups. Platelet-fraction AVP was elevated in patients with CNDI and undetectable in patients with ADCDI. These results suggest that the structure and the function of V1 platelet receptor-effector pathway are normal in patients with CNDI.\r"

We investigated how these indices altered with time and in relation to each other, and how they correlated with a wide range of subsequent patient outcomes. DI, KT/V and PCRN all tended to decrease with time on CAPD (P less than 0.0004, less than 0.0001 and 0.0005, respectively). DI and KT/V were highly correlated with each other (r = 0.89, P less than 0.0001) and both correlated with PCRN (r = 0.57, P less than 0.0001 and r = 0.60, P less than 0.0001, respectively). DI and KT/V both correlated inversely with subsequent values for serum creatinine (P less than 0.0001), urea (P less than 0.0002), potassium (P less than 0.02) and phosphate (P less than 0.002), and directly with bicarbonate (P less than 0.0001). PCRN correlated inversely with serum creatinine (P less than 0.0002) and directly with urea (P less than 0.0001) and with the number of blood transfusions received (P less than 0.03). None of these indices correlated with levels of hemoglobin, PTH, alkaline phosphatase or albumin, or with nerve conduction velocity or any other subsequent clinical outcomes including death, technique failure, hospital days, peritonitis rate and subjective indices of fatigue, pruritus and insomnia. We conclude that the urea kinetic model is predictive of some biochemical outcomes but not of clinical outcomes in CAPD patients.\r"

To evaluate metabolic disturbance as a cause of hematuria, 250 children, aged eight months to fourteen years, with recurrent hematuria were studied. In the present series, metabolic disturbance was mainly due to idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH), the most common etiology of hematuria without proteinuria in childhood. Sixty-seven (27%) of the children had IH, ten children (4%) had hyperuricosuria, and 27 (11%) had nephrolithiasis. To better characterize the IH into renal (RH) or absorptive hypercalciuria (AH) subtypes, 45 of the 67 children (ranging age from six to twelve years) were further submitted to an oral calcium load test. Eighteen patients (40%) had AH, 7 (15.5%) RH and 20 (44.4%) could not be classified as having AH or RH [indeterminant (ID) idiopathic hypercalciuria group]. Intravenous pyelography or ultrasound were normal in all children. The oral calcium load test may be useful in characterizing the subtype of IH in some children; however, a great number of the IH children were characterized as indeterminant. Also hyperuricosuria, recently described as another metabolic disturbance associated with hematuria, may be an important cause of recurrent hematuria in children.\r"

To determine bicarbonate, acetate, lactate and total buffer flux, mass balance studies were performed in patients treated with hemodiafiltration using four different combinations of dialysate and substitution fluids. Driving force for bicarbonate flux was assessed in all treatments. Bicarbonate flux depended on bicarbonate driving force and ultrafiltration rate. Bicarbonate flux was negative in all treatment combinations, even when the driving force was positive. Acetate flux was positive in all treatment combinations, but the net magnitude was small. Lactate flux, when lactate containing substitution fluid was used, varied with dialysate buffer employed during treatment. Overall buffer flux depended on the bicarbonate driving force, ultrafiltration rate, and varied with the type of substitution and dialysate buffer employed. The types and concentrations of buffer used in dialysate and substitution fluid have important effects on the acid-base balance of patients treated with hemodiafiltration. The long-term implications of different therapeutical choices in these patients is unknown.\r"

ELISAs were used to detect IL-1 beta, interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and stromelysin. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was detected by radioimmunoassay. IL-1 beta was present in 65 of 94 (less than 20 to 419 pg/ml, TNF alpha in 54 of 75 (less than 10 to 73 pg/ml), stromelysin in 18 of 23 (less than 1.0 to 56 ng/ml), IL-2 in 7 of 23 (0.1 to 1.3 ng/ml) and PGE2 in 9 of 10 fluids (0.03 to 0.49 ng/ml). Of 51 fluids with immunoreactive IL-1 beta, 36 were mitogenic for thymocytes. IL-1 beta concentrations correlated directly with those of IL-2; IL-1 beta presence was associated with higher stimulation indices, higher mean concentrations of TNF alpha, IL-2, stromelysin, and PGE2, and with positive endotoxin assays, suggesting activation of the cytokine cascade in vivo. Cytokine, stromelysin and PGE2 concentrations did not correlate with sodium or non-sodium solute concentrations, nor with CF blood, osmolality, or endotoxin activity, indicating that differences in concentrations among fluids could not be explained by differences in water content. These data identify cytokines as candidate contributors to the morbidity and pathogenesis of ADPKD.\r"

  ".W": "The improvement in the anemia in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) suggests that dialyzable substances present in the sera of uremic patients either inhibit erythropoiesis directly or inactivate erythropoietin (EPO). In the present study predialysis sera from patients with ESRD inhibited erythroid colony (CFU-E) (N = 10) formation to a significantly (P less than 0.01) greater degree than granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) (N = 7) colony formation in mouse bone marrow (MBM) cultures. The polyamines spermine (SP) (18 to 560 nm/ml) and spermidine (SD) (4 to 648 nm/ml) exerted a more significant (P less than 0.05) inhibition of CFU-E (N greater than or equal to 5) than that of CFU-GM (N greater than or equal to 5) growth. Concentrations of 0.80, 1.0, and 1.5 nm/ml of putrescine (PU) were 92%, 85%, and 77% of erythroid colony (CFU-E) controls (N = 4) and 104%, 130%, and 127% of CFU-GM controls (N = 4). Putrescine (PU) at 1.5 nm/ml also produced a significant (P less than 0.05) inhibition of CFU-E, whereas CFU-GM were stimulated by PU. These data suggest that predialysis sera from uremic patients, as well as SP, SD, and PU, are selectively more inhibitory to CFU-E than CFU-GM growth. The immunoreactivity of EPO was not significantly changed when it was coincubated with SP, SD and PU and measured by radioimmunoassay. PU was found to inhibit noncompetitively the bioactivity of EPO in a CFU-E assay. These data support the hypothesis that polyamines may be important uremic toxins in the anemia of ESRD.\r"

Because sonography has been unable to detect renal function, we aimed to determine whether sonography when aided by PFOB could detect and distinguish the normal from the abnormal osmotic gradient. The sonographer, unaware of rabbit assignment, imaged both kidneys in 17 rabbits before and 24 hours after the temporary occlusion of one of the renal arteries and then again after the infusion of up to 5 ml/kg of PFOB (N = 10) or saline (N = 7). Two normal rabbits were imaged before and after PFOB infusion and then again after i.v. furosemide. Without PFOB, the normal and impaired kidneys were indistinguishable. The echogenicity of the medulla which was darker than cortex in normal kidneys became brighter than cortex after PFOB (increased by 117% +/- 10%; P less than 0.01). PFOB, which was visible in the renal medulla on real-time sonography, produced an echogenic gradient that increased in brightness towards the papillary tip. Because the medulla of kidneys with ATN mildly increased in brightness after PFOB (increased by 40% +/- 7.8%; P less than 0.01), and because the echogenic gradient produced by PFOB was reversed (decreased in brightness towards the papillary tip), ATN kidneys were distinguished from normal kidneys in all 10 rabbits after 2.5 ml/kg PFOB. Medullary echogenicity produced by PFOB in normal kidneys was lost after furosemide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study we evaluated whether Perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB), a sonographic contrast agent given i.v., could aid sonography with this recognition. Partial renal infarction was produced by a 1 mm bead embolized in the right, the left, or both renal arteries of 20 normal rabbits. The sonographer, unaware of rabbit assignment, attempted to diagnose the infarct 24 hours later. All 20 rabbits were studied with gray-scale and color Doppler sonography, 10 before and after PFOB and 10 only after PFOB. Angiography and post-mortem examination were done for confirmation. Of the 20 kidneys evaluated before PFOB, the sonographer was unable to diagnose the 10 partial infarctions. Color Doppler identified five of the ten infarcted kidneys, but accurately localized the infarction in only two. Of the 40 kidneys evaluated after PFOB infusion, 20 scanned before and 20 scanned only after PFOB, all 20 partial infarctions were accurately diagnosed with both gray-scale and color Doppler. PFOB enhanced the echogenicity of perfused renal tissue allowing the easy detection of the unenhanced infarct. Because of the increased signal from vessels after PFOB, color Doppler displayed the entire vascular tree, allowing the detection of the truncated embolized branch. The ability of PFOB to enhance Doppler signals and the echogenicity of perfused tissues improved the diagnostic accuracy of sonography when used to detect partial renal infarctions.\r"

We have investigated the characteristics of anti-DNA antibodies in circulating immune complexes (CIC) and in the deposits of renal glomeruli in patients with active lupus nephritis. The CIC-derived antibodies expressed anti-DNA idiotypes (Id) designated as 0-81 Id and NE-1 Id, and bound mainly to single-stranded DNA but never to glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigens. On the other hand, the immunoglobulins (Ig) eluted from renal glomeruli of lupus patients reacted not only with DNA but also with GBM, proteoglycan, and heparan sulfate. The binding of glomeruli-deposited Ig was markedly low when GBM antigens were used after treatment with heparitinase, suggesting that some anti-DNA antibodies may bind directly to GBM antigens associated with heparan sulfate, and form in situ IC in renal glomeruli. It was also revealed that the renal eluates obtained after passing through GBM antigen-coupled Sepharose lost the binding ability with GBM but still retained DNA-binding and 0-81 Id activity, showing the participation of circulating IC-derived anti-DNA antibodies in the glomerular deposits. Theoretically there may be two mechanisms in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis through the deposition of circulating IC and through in situ formation of anti-DNA IC in renal glomeruli. The diversity of histological features in lupus kidneys may be attributed to the heterogeneity of the mechanisms.\r"

He first assembled vivid illustrations of a wide range of disorders of the kidney found in specimens obtained at autopsy. The resulting Atlas won him widespread praise and is still often cited. His Treatise (Traite des Maladies des Reins et des Alterations de la Secretion Urinaire), in which he integrated data from pathological anatomy with urinary biology and clinical manifestations, was ahead of its time. Hence it was poorly understood and, like the work of many other innovators, was largely ignored. Nevertheless, his 2100 page Traite which begins with a description of his innovative and highly disciplined method of study, most unusual at this time, is by no means lacking in interest for today's nephrologists. Rayer's was a landmark contribution, affording, as it did, a comprehensive approach to the clinical problems of nephrology a century before the diseases themselves could be understood. Could a contemporary of Rayer tell that he was an inventor of scientific methodology before the proof of his rigorous demonstrations was carried out? That has been the achievement of clinical nephrology in the past forty years...one century later.\r"

In the current study, using monoclonal antibodies, we investigated whether mononuclear cells bearing receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2R+ MNC) were present within glomeruli or associated crescents in biopsies from patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis (greater than 60% crescents, N = 19), IgA disease with crescents (N = 9), or other types of proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescents (10 to 44%, N = 6), compared with normal control kidneys (N = 10). Biopsies were further classified into those showing active (cells, fibrin) (N = 15) or inactive (sclerosed) crescents (N = 19), to determine whether IL-2R+ MNC were particularly associated with active crescent formation. Few leucocytes were found within glomerular tufts of normal kidneys (2.4 +/- 0.7 cells/glomerular cross-section; mean +/- SEM). By contrast, in biopsies from patients with active crescentic glomerulonephritis, total intraglomerular tuft leucocytes were increased to 14.0 +/- 1.7 (P less than 0.01 vs. normal kidneys), largely due to increased numbers of intraglomerular monocytes (10.4 +/- 1.1, P less than 0.01) and T cells (3.7 +/- 0.6, P less than 0.01). Biopsies with active crescents also contained significantly increased numbers of intraglomerular tuft IL-2R+ MNC (4.0 +/- 0.7, 29% of total intraglomerular leucocytes), and there was a strong correlation between the numbers of intraglomerular IL-2R+ MNC and T cells (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91269702\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of iron status on aluminum (Al) absorption was investigated in this study in vivo using an animal model and in vitro using an intestinal mucosal cell line. In the in vivo model rats were rendered iron overloaded by intraperitoneal injection of iron dextran (5 mg/48 hr) or iron deficient by phlebotomy (2.5 to 3 ml blood/week). These rats, and normal controls, were then dosed with Al(OH)3 (40 mg/day) for 30 days. Urinary excretion of Al was significantly greater in the iron deficient group than in the other two groups throughout the study period, and brain Al at the end of the experiment was significantly increased in the iron depleted group (1.93 micrograms/g) and decreased in the iron overloaded group (0.73 microgram/g) compared with controls (1.42 micrograms/g). The brain Al levels in iron overloaded rats were no higher than those in normal rats that had not been dosed with Al(OH)3 (0.61 microgram/g). No significant differences were found in serum Al levels. In the in vitro experiments cultures of the rat intestinal cell line RIE1 were iron overloaded by addition of iron nitrilotriacetate (0.1 mM) or iron depleted with desferrioxamine (5 micrograms/ml) for 20 days prior to pulsing with Al transferrin (0.5 mg/ml) for 24 hours. Uptake of Al was significantly greater in the iron depleted cells (2.3 ng/micrograms cell DNA) than in iron overloaded (0.81 ng) or untreated (0.83 microgram) cells. These studies show that iron depletion markedly increases absorption and cellular uptake and suggest that susceptible individuals, such as renal failure patients, run an increased risk of toxicity if they are iron deficient.\r"

Early results of direct-current catheter ablation were encouraging but were associated with complications such as barotrauma and the need for a general anaesthetic. We have investigated the endocardial application of radiofrequency current which is a potentially safer technique. Of 105 patients with an accessory atrioventricular pathway, 79 were located on the left side of the heart and 32 on the right side. Accessory pathway conduction was permanently abolished in 93 (89%) patients. Complications developed in 3 patients: thrombotic occlusion of a femoral artery, arteriovenous fistula formation at the site of groin puncture, and left ventricular rupture with cardiac tamponade after direct-current shocks. There were no deaths from the procedure. We conclude that radiofrequency current catheter ablation is both effective and safe for patients with symptomatic tachyarrhythmias mediated by accessory atrioventricular pathways.\r"

Prevalence of anti-HIV-1 in newborn babies has remained stable in outer London and non-metropolitan districts whereas prevalence in inner London has increased from 1 in 2000 in the 12 months beginning June, 1988, to 1 in 500 in the first 3 months of 1991. Either exponential or linear growth in the numbers of new seropositives could account for the results. That obstetricians were aware of maternal HIV infection in only 20% of infected pregnancies, indicates the extent to which HIV infection goes unrecognised in the heterosexual community.\r"

In January, 1990, unlinked anonymous testing of Guthrie cards for HIV antibody was begun in Scotland. 99.6% of Scottish births were tested. 9 mothers spontaneously refused to allow testing of their baby's blood. Samples were coded by district postcodes. Eluates of 65,773 dried blood spots were initially tested for HIV-1 antibody with the Fujirebio technique. Of the 31 positive samples 19 were confirmed to be positive by enzyme-linked radioimmunoassay and western blot (seroprevalence 0.29 per 1000). All these samples came from large metropolitan areas on the east coast. Prevalences were 2.5 per 1000 for Edinburgh city, 1.4 per 1000 for Dundee, and 0.7 per 1000 for Aberdeen. We identified as HIV-positive all babies known to be so in named testing programmes. HIV testing of Guthrie cards can be used to monitor HIV status in mothers who have just given birth. The use of district postcode data in sample identification will allow accurate targetting of prevention strategies and early detection of spread of infection by geographic area.\r"

Sequence analysis of the MBP gene in three children with recurrent infections, the opsonic defect, and low serum MBP concentrations showed a point mutation at base 230 of exon 1 causing a change of codon 54 from GGC to GAC. The replacement of glycine with an aspartic acid residue disrupts the fifth Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat in the collagen-like domain of each 32 kD MBP peptide chain and probably prevents the formation of the normal triple helix. Study of sixteen members of the three families showed autosomal dominant co-inheritance of the mutation and low serum MBP concentrations.\r"

We determined the long-term outcome of instrumental deliveries in 52,282 infants born in Jerusalem between 1964 and 1972. For each individual, events at birth were related to results of an intelligence test and medical examination done at 17 years of age by the Israeli Defence Forces draft board. 1747 individuals were delivered by vacuum, 937 by forceps, 47,500 by spontaneous delivery, and 2098 by caesarean section. Crude data showed that mean intelligence scores at 17 were significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) in the vacuum and forceps deliveries groups than in the spontaneous-delivery group; however, after adjustment for confounding factors by stepwise multiple regression, these differences were no longer seen. Although the forceps-delivery group had functional impairment of feet, vision, and retina compared with the spontaneous-delivery group, and the vacuum-extraction group had impairment of the legs, differences were small. Our findings suggest that infants delivered by vacuum or forceps are not at risk of physical and cognitive impairment at 17 years of age.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. It is uncertain whether Plasmodium falciparum malaria is more frequent or more severe in children with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and whether P. falciparum infection accelerates the progression of HIV-related disease. METHODS. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in Kinshasa, Zaire. Two hundred sixty children 5 to 9 months of age who had been born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and 327 children of the same age who had been born to seronegative mothers were monitored intensively for malaria over a 13-month period. All episodes of fever were evaluated with blood smears for malaria, and children found to be infected with P. falciparum were treated with a standard regimen of oral quinine. RESULTS. A total of 2899 fevers were evaluated, with 271 cases of malaria identified. No statistically significant differences were found in the incidence, severity, or response to therapy of malaria among four well-defined groups of children: those with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), those who were HIV-1-seropositive throughout the study, those who were born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers but reverted to seronegative, and those who were seronegative throughout the study. During the 13-month period the incidence of malaria in the 36 children with HIV infection in whom AIDS developed was lower, although not significantly so, than in the 37 in whom AIDS did not. CONCLUSIONS. In this study malaria was not more frequent or more severe in children with progressive HIV-1 infection and malaria did not appear to accelerate the rate of progression of HIV-1 disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The optimal short-term, symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee has not been fully determined. Accordingly, we compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, given in either an antiinflammatory dose (high dose) or an analgesic dose (low dose), with that of acetaminophen, a pure analgesic. METHODS. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 184 patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis were given either 2400 or 1200 mg of ibuprofen per day or 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. They were evaluated after a washout period of three to seven days before the beginning of the study, and again after four weeks of treatment. The major measures of outcome included scores on the pain and disability scales of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (range of possible scores, 0 to 3), scores on the visual-analogue scales for pain at rest and pain while walking, the time needed to walk 50 ft (15 m), and the physician's global assessment of the patient's arthritis. RESULTS. Seventy-eight percent of the patients completed four weeks of therapy. No significant differences were noted among the three treatment groups with respect to failure to complete the trial because of noncompliance or adverse events. All three groups had improvement in all major outcome variables, and the groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of improvement in most variables. The mean improvement (change) in the scores on the pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.33 with acetaminophen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.52), 0.30 with the low dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.51), and 0.35 with the high dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.57). Side effects were minor and similar in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS. In short-term, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the efficacy of acetaminophen was similar to that of ibuprofen, whether the latter was administered in an analgesic or an antiinflammatory dose.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In closely confined populations, in which epidemics of Streptococcus pyogenes infection are common, penicillin G benzathine has long been used prophylactically to reduce morbidity from this pathogen. We report on our investigations of the effectiveness of penicillin G benzathine prophylaxis at a military recruit camp. METHODS. We prospectively studied the rates of pharyngeal colonization and infection by S. pyogenes among 736 male U.S. Marine Corps recruits from January through March 1989. Throat swabs for culture, clinical data, and questionnaire data were obtained during six examinations at intervals of two weeks. Serum samples obtained before training, after training, and from acutely ill recruits were analyzed with use of an antistreptolysin O microtitration technique. RESULTS. Although 93 percent of the recruits received prophylaxis with two intramuscular injections of 1.2 million units of penicillin G benzathine each (administered 30 to 39 days apart), 33 percent of the recruits were colonized by S. pyogenes, and 42 percent had infection (as defined by a two-dilution increase in the antistreptolysin O titer). Thirty-seven percent of 265 recruits who reported a sore throat and were infected with S. pyogenes did not seek medical attention. The recruits who were allergic to penicillin (7 percent of the total), who received no prophylaxis, were more likely to be colonized; an increased risk of colonization and infection among the nonallergic recruits was associated with the presence of a higher percentage of allergic recruits in the platoon. After the study was completed, all recruits who were allergic to penicillin were prescribed 250 mg of oral erythromycin twice daily (a total daily dose of 500 mg) for 60 days. Subsequently, the average weekly rate of clinically evident S. pyogenes pharyngitis fell by more than 75 percent. CONCLUSIONS. If the prevention of S. pyogenes infection is to be effective in closely confined populations such as military recruits, prophylactic antibiotics must be administered to all members of the population. Exempting those who are allergic to penicillin may create a bacterial reservoir from which infection can be transmitted to nonallergic members of the population.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Many patients who have been treated successfully for childhood cancer with regimens that contain one or more mutagenic chemotherapeutic agents are concerned that their own treatment during childhood or adolescence may adversely affect their children. METHODS. To determine the effect of chemotherapy for cancer during childhood and adolescence on the outcome of subsequent pregnancies, we reviewed the records of 306 men and women who had been treated for pediatric cancer and who responded to our questionnaire. One hundred of the 306 patients reported 202 pregnancies. Among the patients who had received chemotherapy as part of their treatment for cancer, 60 patients or wives of patients had had one or more pregnancies of 20 or more weeks' gestation. The 60 former patients had a total of 100 live-born and 2 stillborn children. RESULTS. The frequency of congenital anomalies was 8.1 percent (5 of 62) among the live-born children of the women and 7.9 percent (3 of 38) among the live-born children of the men. Structural congenital cardiac defects were identified in 10.0 percent (2 of 20) of the children of women who had been treated with dactinomycin, as compared with 0.6 percent (144 of 24,153) among the children in a multicenter survey of fetal anomalies (P = 0.0126). We found no relation between the number of mutagens received or the cumulative dose of any agent received and the frequency of congenital anomalies in the children. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that treatment of children and adolescents with mutagenic chemotherapeutic agents, in the dose ranges we examined, does not increase the frequency of congenital anomalies in the children subsequently born to the former patients. However, the possible adverse effect of dactinomycin on the children of such patients requires further study.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Physical activity is recommended by physicians to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), because it increases sensitivity to insulin. Whether physical activity is effective in preventing this disease is not known. METHODS. We used questionnaires to examine patterns of physical activity and other personal characteristics in relation to the subsequent development of NIDDM in 5990 male alumni of the University of Pennsylvania. The disease developed in a total of 202 men during 98,524 man-years of follow-up from 1962 to 1976. RESULTS. Leisure-time physical activity, expressed in kilocalories expended per week in walking, stair climbing, and sports, was inversely related to the development of NIDDM. The incidence rates declined as energy expenditure increased from less than 500 kcal to 3500 kcal. For each 500-kcal increment in energy expenditure, the age-adjusted risk of NIDDM was reduced by 6 percent (relative risk, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.98). This association remained the same when the data were adjusted for obesity, hypertension, and a parental history of diabetes. The association was weaker when we considered weight gain between the time of college attendance and 1962 (relative risk, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.00). The protective effect of physical activity was strongest in persons at highest risk for NIDDM, defined as those with a high body-mass index, a history of hypertension, or a parental history of diabetes. These factors, in addition to weight gain since college, were also independent predictors of the disease. CONCLUSIONS. Increased physical activity is effective in preventing NIDDM, and the protective benefit is especially pronounced in persons at the highest risk for the disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Severe factor XI deficiency, which is relatively common among Ashkenazi Jews, is associated with injury-related bleeding of considerable severity. Three point mutations--a splice-junction abnormality (Type I), Glu117----Stop (Type II), and Phe283----Leu (Type III)--have been described in six patients with factor XI deficiency. Clinical correlations with these mutations have not been carried out. We determined the relative frequency of the mutations and their association with plasma levels of factor XI clotting activity and bleeding, analyzing the mutations with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction-enzyme digestion. RESULTS. The Type II and Type III mutations had similar frequencies among 43 Ashkenazi Jewish probands with severe factor XI deficiency; these two mutations accounted for 49 percent and 47 percent, respectively, of a total of 86 analyzed alleles. Among 40 of the probands and 12 of their relatives with severe factor XI deficiency, patients homozygous for Type III mutation had a significantly higher level of factor XI clotting activity (mean [+/- SD] percentage of normal values, 9.7 +/- 3.8 percent; n = 13) than those homozygous for Type II mutation (1.2 +/- 0.5 percent, n = 16) or compound heterozygotes with Type II/III mutation (3.3 +/- 1.6 percent, n = 23), as well as significantly fewer episodes of injury-related bleeding. Each of these three groups had a similarly increased proportion of episodes of bleeding complications after surgery at sites with enhanced local fibrinolysis, such as the urinary tract, or during tooth extraction. CONCLUSIONS. Type II and Type III mutations are the predominant causes of factor XI deficiency among Ashkenazi Jews. Genotypic analysis, assay for factor XI, and consideration of the type and location of surgery can be helpful in planning operations in patients with this disorder.\r"

RESULTS. Of the 46 children (age range, 2 to 15 years), 33 (72 percent) initially had erythema migrans, 7 (15 percent) had influenza-like symptoms, and 6 (13 percent) had migratory joint pain. These manifestations were followed by brief attacks of arthritis, particularly affecting the knee. The percentage of children with recurrent episodes of arthritis declined each year. By year 4, only 10 children still had a mean of two episodes of arthritis per year; the duration of arthritis was generally longer in older children (P less than 0.05). During the sixth year of illness, two children (4 percent) had keratitis, and more than 10 years after the onset of disease, a subtle encephalopathy developed in two other children. Of the 39 children whom we were able to contact in 1988-1989, 12 (31 percent) still had occasional brief episodes of joint pain and 1 (3 percent) had marked fatigue. All 46 children had positive IgG antibody responses to Borrelia burgdorferi throughout the illness and on long-term follow-up. As compared with those who became asymptomatic, the children with recurrent symptoms more often had IgM responses to the spirochete and had significantly higher IgG titers (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. The course of initially untreated Lyme disease in children may include acute infection followed by attacks of arthritis and then by keratitis, subtle joint pain, or chronic encephalopathy.\r"

Steranes are of particular importance as they can be related to naturally occurring precursors. These compounds generally experience intense biodegradation, however, which alters their original distribution and obscures the information that they carry regarding oil maturity and source material. In an attempt to identify the microorganisms responsible for this degradation, we have investigated the capacity of 73 aerobic bacteria to degrade steranes present in Rozel Point (Utah) oil. Seven Gram-positive strains, belonging to a limited number of genera, were found to be active. Using Nocardia sp. SEBR 16, which caused the most extensive alteration, we have determined biodegradation rates for several isomers of steranes and methylsteranes. The preference for alteration of different isomers reflects that observed in natural environments, suggesting that the degradation intermediates could be used as indicators of the extent of the biodegradation in an oil. In addition, the microorganisms used here might be effective in biodegrading oil spills.\r"

  ".W": "The guinea-pig (Cavia porcellus), traditionally classified as a New World hystricomorph rodent, often shows anomalous morphological and molecular features in comparison with other eutherian mammals. For example, its insulin differs from that of other mammals in anabolic and growth-promoting activities and in its capability to form hexamers. Indeed, the literature about the molecular evolution of guinea-pigs abounds in references to 'convergent evolution', 'extremely rapid rates of substitution', and 'unique evolutionary mechanisms'. These claims are based on the assumption that the guinea-pig is a rodent. Our phylogenetic analyses of amino-acid sequence data, however, imply that the guinea-pig diverged before the separation of the primates and the artiodactyls from the myomorph rodents (rats and mice). If true, then the myomorphs and the caviomorphs do not constitute a natural clade, and the Caviomorpha (or the Histricomorpha) should be elevated in taxonomical rank and regarded as a separate mammalian order distinct from the Rodentia. If, as suggested by recent data, the myomorphs branched off before the divergence among the carnivores, lagomorphs, artiodactyls and primates, then the new order would represent an early divergence in eutherian radiation.\r"

  ".U": "91270371\r", 
  ".W": "The sensitivity to light is low in many neonatal mammals when compared with that in the adult. In human infants at one month of age, for example, the dark-adapted sensitivity for detection of large stimuli is 50 times lower than in the adult, and in rats the overall sensitivity of the neonatal retina is also low compared with the adult. This low sensitivity in the neonate has been attributed to a number of factors, but the possibility that the photoreceptors themselves might be an important limitation on the overall visual sensitivity has not so far been clearly established. Here we record the light response of single neonatal rat rods and find that the sensitivity is considerably lower than in the adult. The response to a single photoisomerization is normal in the neonate, and the sensitivity deficit can therefore be attributed to a low level of functional rhodopsin. Opsin, the protein component of rhodopsin, must be present in normal amounts, as the sensitivity can be restored to adult levels by treating the retina with 9-cis retinal, an active homologue of the native chromophore 11-cis retinal. The low sensitivity of photoreceptors in the neonate can therefore be attributed mainly to a low concentration of 11-cis retinal in the developing retina.\r"

  ".W": "N-type calcium channels are thought to be expressed specifically in neuronal cells and to have a dominant role in the control of neurotransmitter release from sympathetic neurons. But their unitary properties are poorly understood and the separation of neuronal Ca2+ current into components carried by N-type or L-type Ca2+ channels is controversial. Here we show that individual N-type Ca2+ channels in sympathetic neurons can carry two kinetically distinct components of current, one that is rapidly transient and one that is long lasting. The mechanism that gives rise to these two components is unexpected for Ca2+ channels: a test depolarization elicits either a rapidly inactivating, single short burst with an average duration of 40 ms, or sustained, noninactivating channel activity lasting for over 1 s. The switching between inactivating and noninactivating activity is a slow process, the occurrence of each type of unitary kinetic behaviour remaining statistically correlated over several seconds. Variable coupling of inactivation in N-type Ca2+ channels could be an effective mechanism for the modulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity.\r"

Although lactation can be induced without a preceding pregnancy in some species, this requires exogenous hormones, artificially intense or extended suckling or both. Spontaneous lactation, lactation by females that have neither been pregnant nor experimentally manipulated, is extremely unusual among eutherians. Among nondomesticated animals, spontaneous lactation has been observed repeatedly only in the dwarf mongoose Helogale parvula. We report here spontaneous lactation by free-living dwarf mongooses using data on urinary oestrogen conjugate concentrations (n = 560, 65 females) and body weight (n = 3,096, 25 females) from a population in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We use demographic data from this population to demonstrate that spontaneous lactation, and thus the endocrine phenomena that induce it, increase the evolutionary fitness of lactating females.\r"

  ".U": "91270374\r", 
  ".W": "The glycoprotein CD5 is expressed on the surface membrane of all mature T cells and a small proportion of B lymphocytes. Its exact role in immune interactions is still unknown. Studies indicate that CD5 functions both in mice and humans as a receptor, delivering co-stimulatory signals to T cells in a manner similar to CD2 (ref. 11) and CD28 (ref. 12). Anti-CD5 antibodies stimulate both T-cell proliferation mediated by CD3 in association with the T-cell receptor and secretion of interleukin-2 and expression of its receptor, as well as inducing an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (refs 5-10). To identify the ligand for CD5 we purified the human CD5 protein, labelled it with biotin and used it as a probe. Here we report that CD5 specifically interacts with the cell-surface protein CD72 exclusive to B cells. This interaction is blocked by anti-CD72 antibodies, but not by any other anti-B-cell antibodies. Moreover, non-B cells (mouse L-cell fibroblasts and human Jurkat T cells) expressing a transfected human CD72 complementary DNA could bind to the CD5-biotin conjugate. The results demonstrate that the B-cell surface protein CD72 (Lyb-2 in mice) is the ligand for CD5.\r"

Given the unusual differential parental allele involvement in the different aetiological forms of BWS and the loss of maternal alleles in associated tumours, we have now used 11p15.5 markers to determine the parental origin of chromosome 11 in eight sporadic cases of BWS. Probands in three informative families had uniparental paternal disomy for region 11p15.5. Further, an overall greatly increased frequency of homozygosity for several 11p15.5 markers in 21 sporadic BWS patients suggests that isodisomy probably accounts for an even higher proportion of BWS sporadic cases. This demonstrates that uniparental paternal disomy can be associated with a genetic cancer-predisposing syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse embryos with duplications of whole maternal (parthenogenetic and gynogenetic) or paternal (androgenetic) genomes show reciprocal phenotypes and do not develop to term. Genetic complementation has identified the distal region of chromosome 7 (Chr 7) as one of the regions for which both a maternal and paternal chromosome copy are essential for normal development, presumably because of the presence of imprinted genes whose expression is dependent on their parental origin. Embryos with the maternal duplication and paternal deficiency of distal Chr 7 are growth retarded and die around day 16 of gestation; the reciprocal paternal duplication embryos die at an unidentified earlier stage. We report here the incorporation of cells with the paternal duplication into chimaeras, resulting in a striking growth enhancement of the embryos. One gene located on mouse distal Chr 7 (ref. 5) is the insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene, an embryonic mitogen. In embryos with the maternal duplication of distal Chr 7, the two maternal alleles of the Igf2 gene are repressed. The presence of two paternal alleles of this gene in many cells is probably responsible for the growth enhancement observed in chimaeras. We propose that there are other imprinted genes in this Chr 7 region. We also compare the imprinting of this subgenomic region with phenotypes resulting from the duplication of the whole parental genome in parthenogenones and androgenones.\r"

  ".W": "The intracellular retinoid-binding proteins bind retinol, retinaldehyde, and retinoic acid for purposes of protection against decomposition, solubilize them in aqueous medium, render them nontoxic, and transport them within cells to their site of action. These binding proteins also function by presenting the retinoids to the appropriate enzymes for metabolism. The cytosolic retinol and retinoic acid-binding proteins--CRBP, CRABP, CRBP (II)--function in transport and metabolism of retinoids within parenchymal, intestinal, reproductive, and fetal cells and across blood-organ barriers. A different group of retinoid-binding proteins, more related to serum retinol-binding protein, functions in epididymis and uterus. Retinaldehyde-binding protein aids in the oxidation-reduction reaction of 11-cis-retinol-11-cis-retinaldehyde in the retina, where the interphotoreceptor retinol-binding protein transports retinol between pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. Finally, a group of retinoic acid-binding proteins termed \"receptors\" functions in the nucleus by attaching to promoter regions of a number of specific genes to stimulate their transcription and thus affect growth, development, and differentiation.\r"

Despite nutritional and behavioral counseling, she has rigorously maintained her exaggerated weight loss.

  ".W": "Four surgeons evaluated induced astigmatism and postoperative wound stability in a randomized prospective study of 130 patients undergoing cataract extraction. After phacoemulsification through a scleral pocket, patients received either a 6.5-mm diameter silicone optic posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) folded for insertion through a 4-mm small incision or a 6.0-mm diameter polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) optic PC IOL placed through an approximately 6.5-mm conventional incision. Vector analysis calculations of prism diopters (D) of mean postoperative-induced keratometric astigmatism for the small incision versus conventional incision groups were, at day 1, 1.54 D versus 3.07 D (P less than 0.0001); at weeks 1 to 2, 1.00 D versus 2.43 D (P less than 0.0001); at 1 month, 0.98 D versus 1.44 D (P = 0.004); and at 3 months, 0.82 D versus 1.03 D (P = 0.089). Subgroup analysis of the suturing technique for the 6.5-mm incision showed that the technique of wound closure, as well as the wound size, influenced the induced astigmatism. For all four surgeons using three methods of suturing the 6.5-mm wound, however, the variability in the amount of induced cylinder was least with the 4.0-mm wound closed with a horizontal mattress suture. Complications in the two groups were comparable.\r"

Over 90% of cases had been done with the \"can opener\" technique. A surprisingly high percentage of cases, 86%, had one to five radial tears. Furthermore, our analysis showed that the most consistent and most permanent in-the-bag fixation was achieved when only one tear or less was present in the anterior capsule. Because this study shows that the incidence of radial tears is very high after nuclear expression with \"can opener\" capsulectomy, it provides a scientific basis supporting the transition toward the continuous circular capsulorhexis technique that is slowly evolving. The latter technique has been shown to minimize the incidence of anterior capsular radial tears. This may ultimately serve to decrease the incidence of PC IOL decentration, an important goal if the use of bimultifocal IOLs and IOLs with small or aspheric optics is to be successful.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of anterior capsular radial tear formation and extension around the equator onto the posterior capsule were investigated in 57 eyes obtained postmortem. Experimental radial tears were created by gradual opening of a caliper. In 95% of cases, the tear immediately reached the equator but none extended to the posterior capsule. The elastic forces of the zonules attached to or crossing the edges of the tear resisted a widening of the gap between the edges and thus limited the radial progression of the rupture. A significantly stronger force and severing of the zonules were necessary for a tear to extend around the equator. The authors have determined that radial tears in the anterior capsule seldom extend around the equator, providing the zonules bridging the tear are intact. There is a diminution of the tearing force when the flaps are widely open. Careful surgery with preservation of the integrity of the capsular-zonular apparatus is a major factor in preventing major complications such as posterior capsular ruptures.\r"

Eighteen (90%) eyes showed complete remission promptly after surgery; the other two also healed with the administration of additional systemic and topical steroids. During the follow-up periods (mean, 3.1 years), minor recurrence was found in 5 (25%) eyes for the first 6 months, in none (0%) for the second 6 months, in 2 (12%) for the third 6 months, and none thereafter. All seven eyes with recurrence were cured by additional steroid treatment, alone or with conjunctival excision and/or keratoepithelioplasty. In the 18 (90%) eyes, the lenticules, constantly observed, remained silent on the scleras, which were free from conjunctival invasion. These results strongly support the authors' theory that keratoepithelioplasty using donor corneal lenticules can heal Mooren's ulcer via blockage of infiltrated conjunctival invasion.\r"

To determine a possible role for HMB-45 in ophthalmic pathology, 45 conjunctival lesions, including 23 melanomas, were analyzed using immunohistochemical techniques with anti-S-100 and HMB-45 as primary antibodies. Nineteen (82.6%) of the melanomas exhibited HMB-45 positivity, and 19 (82.6%) contained S-100 protein, with concordance of all but two cases. Seven cases of primary acquired melanosis were studied; one (33%) of three with atypia was HMB-45 positive, as were two (50%) of four without atypia. Among nevi, 1 (9.1%) of 11 showed faint staining with HMB-45. Fifteen conjunctival epithelial dysplasias were negative with HMB-45. At present, HMB-45 appears to offer no great advantage over S-100 protein in the analysis of conjunctival melanomas.

Of the 104 (35.9%) patients who experienced a recurrence of their disease, only 12 had progressed from diffuse to nodular disease, and 10 patients who originally had nodular disease developed scleral necrosis. Patients with necrotizing scleritis were older than patients in the other groups and more frequently had an associated systemic disease than patients with either diffuse or nodular disease; necrotizing scleritis was the most difficult disease to treat. Diffuse anterior scleritis had a lower incidence of visual loss (9%) than either nodular scleritis (26%) or necrotizing disease (74%), and, therefore, the authors consider nodular scleritis a disease of intermediate severity between diffuse scleritis and necrotizing disease. In this series, 12% of patients presented with posterior scleritis, and visual loss was most frequent in this group (84%).\r"

Vascular immunodeposits were found in 93% of the scleral and 79% of the conjunctival tissue tested by immunofluorescence techniques. A dramatic increase in the number of inflammatory cells over normal controls was detected in both tissues by immunoperoxidase techniques. In the conjunctival epithelium, there were significantly more T-helpers, macrophages, and B cells. In the conjunctival substantia propria, there were significantly more T cells of all types, macrophages, and B cells. Likewise, scleral specimens showed an increase over controls of T cells of all types and macrophages. HLA-DR expression was dramatically increased in both tissues. Immune-complex-mediated vasculitis plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of necrotizing scleritis and recurrent nonnecrotizing scleritis.

Seven patients had uveitis, eight had episcleritis, and four had anterior scleritis. Large peripheral corneal infiltrates developed in two patients with scleritis. Increased bowel activity was closely related to the presence of acute episcleritis but not to uveitis or scleritis. To determine risk factors for the development of ocular inflammation, this group of 19 patients was compared with a group of 93 patients with Crohn's disease in whom ocular inflammation was not present. There were no demographic differences between the groups. Patients with colitis or ileocolitis were more likely to suffer from ocular inflammation (23.9%, 17 of 71), than patients with small bowel involvement alone (2.8%, 1 of 36) (P = 0.013). Those with arthritis or arthralgia had a higher incidence of ocular inflammation (29.4%, 15 of 51), than patients without joint involvement (6.6%, 4 of 61) (P = 0.003). These results suggest that the risk of developing ocular inflammation in Crohn's disease may be related to the site of bowel involvement and to the presence of arthritis.\r"

All 76 locations of Humphrey program 30-2 could be tested twice within 5.5 minutes and the relative sensitivity of the field was determined by comparing the amplitude of pupil constriction or latency time at each stimulus location. The mean pupil responses within annular areas at 3 degrees, 9 degrees, 15 degrees, 21 degrees, and 27 degrees were shown to be linearly related to log stimulus intensity over a 15 dB range under low level mesopic conditions (3.15 asb bowl background). In normal subjects, the superior temporal quadrant usually had the greatest mean pupillomotor response and the inferior nasal quadrant had the least. Pupil responses in the temporal field were larger than corresponding locations in the nasal field. Patients with visual field defects who underwent testing by pupil perimetry showed pupillary deficits in the same location within the field, providing evidence that pupil perimetry may be a useful, objective means of assessing visual field function.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective, randomized, double-masked, and placebo-controlled study was performed to evaluate the effects of a localized and sustained release of mitomycin on the success of glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits. A bioerodible polymer was used as the drug carrier. Full-thickness filtration surgeries were performed and data from 22 rabbits were collected. One eye received a polymer impregnated with mitomycin (0.02 mg or 0.06 mg), while the fellow eye received a drug-free polymer. Intraocular pressure, bleb survival, and postoperative complications were investigated. Intraocular pressures remained lower for a longer period of time (P less than 0.004) and filtration blebs lasted longer (P less than 0.05) in experimental eyes than in control eyes. Conjunctivitis and sectorial corneal haze occurred more frequently in eyes treated with the higher dosage mitomycin compared with control eyes. The use of mitomycin-C in a polymer delivery system appeared to promote the success of glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits. With the lower dosage of mitomycin, clinically significant ocular toxicity was not noted.\r"

Botulinum toxin appears to be useful as a primary treatment modality for persistent strabismus following retinal detachment surgery, possibly obviating the need for complicated strabismus surgery.\r"

Fifty consecutive patients undergoing scleral buckling under general anesthesia were randomized to receive either bupivacaine or balanced salt solution as a retrobulbar irrigation at the end of their retinal detachment procedure. Of the 25 patients who received bupivacaine, only three (12%) required parenteral pain relief in the first 24 hours after surgery. This was statistically significant when compared with the 18 (72%) of 25 patients requiring parenteral pain relief in the placebo group (P less than 0.0001). In addition, when questioned about their perception of the degree of postoperative pain, patients in the control group rated their level of pain as significantly more severe than did patients in the bupivacaine group. The authors conclude that retrobulbar irrigation with bupivacaine is a safe and effective way to achieve postoperative pain relief after surgery for scleral buckling.\r"

Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) developed in 8 of the 20 eyes (40%) in this series.

  ".W": "A 15-year-old boy underwent neuroradiologic embolization of the left internal maxillary artery with polyvinyl alcohol to stop traumatic epistaxis after failure of surgical clipping and nasal packing. Selective catheterization of the external carotid artery before embolization showed a faint choroidal blush. Although the procedure provided hemostasis, embolization to the central retinal artery and ciliary arteries resulted in loss of vision. The route of the emboli to the eye was via the anastomotic network of the lacrimal artery supplied by the external carotid artery system. Neuroradiologic embolization of the external carotid artery is an effective mode of therapy for dural-cavernous fistulas when fed by the external carotid artery system. Because the blood flow to the brain and eye is predominantly supplied by the internal carotid artery, embolization of the external carotid artery is considered relatively safe. The authors document the importance of recognition of the choroidal blush during selective external carotid artery angiography as a sign of collateral blood flow to the eye. Physicians and patients need to be aware of the risk of blindness as a complication of external carotid artery embolization when this sign is present.\r"

In five (25%) patients, there was a slight asymmetry in clarity between the examined and control eyes, but this did not affect the ability to interpret the angiogram. The results were verified by comparing the overall quality of the transit phase of the angiograms. The application of a fundus contact lens to the cornea using saline solution as a coupling agent does not adversely affect the clarity of subsequent fluorescein angiography.\r"

Histopathologic evaluation of six eyes demonstrated microcystic changes throughout the perifoveal inner nuclear layer. These coalesced into larger cystic spaces in the outer plexiform layer of the central macula. These macular changes are previously unreported in patients or monkeys undergoing intravitreal injection of expansile gases. This model for macular cysts may be helpful in evaluating the pathogenesis and role of interventional strategies in patients with cystoid macular edema.\r"

Although altered perfusion of the retinal vessels may be evaluated clinically, assessment of blood flow in the ophthalmic and ciliary arteries previously could be evaluated only indirectly by intravenous fluorescein angiography. The color Doppler imaging findings were confirmed by intravenous fluorescein angiography and carotid arteriography. Color Doppler imaging represents a noninvasive method to diagnose abnormal blood flow of the ophthalmic artery and its branches and to evaluate serial changes of the circulation in a noninvasive manner.\r"

This search revealed that 105 abstracts (60%) led to full-length articles in peer-reviewed journals within 50 to 56 months of the meeting date. A median interval of 13 months occurred from date of abstract publication to acceptance of the corresponding article. Most articles appeared within 3 years of abstract presentation. Sixty-four percent (48 of 75) of the posters and free papers presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in November 1984 led to full-length articles, as did 57% (57 of 100) of the abstracts presented at the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology in May 1985. These findings emphasize the preliminary nature of abstracts. The fact that nearly 60% of abstracts are published reflects favorably on the review process of both meetings.\r"

Surgical procedure included disk repositioning (23 joints) and diskectomy (seven joints). At the time of reimaging, 20 joints showed recurrence of pain and 10 joints were asymptomatic. Extensive fibrous tissue was seen in the joint space and in the joint capsule in 13 of the 20 painful joints, whereas minimal fibrous tissue in the lateral capsule wall was seen in 3 of the 10 nonpainful joints. Fibrous tissue was surgically confirmed in 10 of the painful joints. Disk displacement was seen in 11 of the 23 joints that had surgical disk repositioning. Disk displacement was seen in both painful (9/17) and nonpainful joints (2/6). It was concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent method for postoperative imaging of the temporomandibular joint and that attention should be directed to the presence or absence and extension of the fibrous tissue in the joint space and in the joint capsule.\r"

One hundred eighty-six patients with signs and symptoms of TMJ dysfunction were clinically examined before TMJ arthrography. Arthrograms were performed on 246 joints (126 unilateral, 60 bilateral). The rules predicted 91 of the 246 joints to be normal when actually 59 were shown to be normal arthrographically. The rules slightly underpredicted those patients with positive arthrographic findings for internal derangements. Although there were some individual variations in the predictability of unilateral versus bilateral arthrograms (patients), there was very little overall difference, 58% and 60%, respectively. This study confirms previous suggestions that clinical findings alone are not consistently accurate in diagnosing the exact type of TMJ internal derangements depicted by arthrographic criteria.\r"

Frequently these malignancies appear clinically as masquerading inflammatory disease processes. Recognition of these rare lesions usually occurs only after the inflammatory-like symptoms have failed to respond to conventional management, necessitating a more extensive evaluation and even repeated biopsies. The use of special stains, immunohistochemical studies, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence techniques may still produce an inconclusive histopathologic diagnosis. This case report documents a rare extranodal malignant lymphoma of the right maxillary sinus that mimicked an odontogenic infection with superimposed chronic rhinosinusitis in a 19-year-old sailor. The cause of his chief complaint and presenting symptoms challenged the astuteness of clinicians, surgeons, and histopathologists on two continents and the high seas. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for malignancy when inflammatory-like lesions fail to respond to the usual appropriate management. Indications for early biopsy of suspect lesions and aggressive follow-up are emphasized.\r"

Seven-and-a-half months to 1 year after implantation, the apatite root was directly bound to the newly formed lamellar bone, which provided strong bone bonding (apatite-bone bonding). There appear to be two types of mechanisms for the resorption of apatite ceramics: first, cellular-type resorption by both multinuclear and mononuclear macrophages; and second, a noncellular, fluid mechanism (dissolution). The gingival sulcus around implants and downward growth of the epithelial cells could be observed in almost all of the implants. There was no cellular inflammation in the tissue around the implants, in the nasal cavity, or in the maxillary sinus. From this study we concluded that clinical application of this dental implant system would be practical.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is associated with diverse oral manifestations, which can potentially involve both hard and soft tissues, depending on the specific EB subtype. This study determined the frequency and extent of oral soft tissue involvement in the inherited forms of EB. Examination of 216 affected persons revealed significant differences in the oral soft tissue involvement among the various types of EB. The frequency of oral involvement was greater in the dominant dystrophic (81.1%) and simplex (generalized, 58.6%; localized, 34.7%) types than previously reported. The marked frequency of oral blistering was similar in both major subtypes of junctional (Herlitz, 83.3%; non-Herlitz, 91.6%) and recessive dystrophic EB (generalized, 100%; localized, 92.3%). Obliteration of the oral vestibule, ankyloglossia, and microstomia were consistent findings in generalized recessive dystrophic EB. Oral milia were present in all major EB categories, most prevalently in the dystrophic forms, but were not seen in all the distinct EB subtypes. These findings indicate that although there are no pathognomonic intraoral soft tissue manifestations in the various forms of inherited EB, there are predictable patterns of involvement associated with specific subtypes of this disease. Understanding the oral involvement associated with EB may aid clinicians in the development of more advanced therapeutic approaches that are compatible with and directed at the unique characteristics of each EB subtype.\r"

The number of subjects with serum zinc levels less than the minimum normal value (less than 11 mumol/L) was higher in the patients with BMS (30%) than in the control subjects (10%). These results suggest that in some patients low serum zinc levels may be associated with BMS. However, the number of patients with BMS was too small to allow definite conclusions.\r"

The tumors that developed were examined histologically. The cellular features and tumor growth patterns were compared between the original oral squamous cell carcinoma (T0) and the tumor that developed in the xenogeneic host (T1). The T1 tumors were more highly differentiated in comparison with the T0 tumors. The T1 tumors exhibited less cellular pleomorphism and a more uniform pattern of stratification. The cells in the T1 tumors exhibited an increased mitotic index but did not contain abnormal mitoses. The T1 tumors usually exhibited nodular growth patterns rather than the infiltrating pattern exhibited by the parenchyma of the T0 tumors. The desmoplastic reaction was markedly reduced in the T1 tumors. The results indicated that the gnotobiotic nude mouse model system either selects for or induces a more differentiated pattern of tumor growth than that found in the original human oral squamous cell carcinomas.\r"

This effect is postulated to occur by enhancement of the error-prone cellular repair function, which could also be associated with oncogenic cell transformation. The present study was designed to investigate whether treatment of green monkey kidney cells with water extract of snuff (snuff extract), benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine, or tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines would result in enhanced survival of UV-irradiated herpes simplex virus (HSV). Exposure of the cells with snuff extract, benzo[a]pyrene. N'-nitrosonornicotine, or 4-(N-methyl-N'-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone resulted in an enhancement of survival of UV-irradiated HSV type 1 compared with the control whereas exposure of the cells with nicotine did not. These data indicate that the water-extractable component of snuff and tobacco-related chemical carcinogens increase the cellular repair mechanism and provides for increased survival of UV-irradiated HSV.\r"

The polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas were for the most part distinctive in their microscopic appearance. Typically they exhibited infiltrative growth by small uniform cells in single-layered ducts. A syncytium of tumor cells was also characteristic, although solid and cribriform patterns were seen, making definitive diagnosis difficult with some tumors. Immunohistochemical staining for S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, actin, vimentin, and keratins resulted in relatively distinctive antigenic profiles for the tumors studied. Of significance was strong S-100 protein and weak actin staining of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas, moderate actin staining of adenoid cystic carcinomas, moderate glial fibrillary acidic protein staining of monomorphic adenomas and pleomorphic adenomas, and nonreactivity of monomorphic adenomas for vimentin. It is believed that the immunoprofiles could be useful in the microscopic diagnosis of salivary gland tumors. The identification of antigens found normally in myoepithelial and epithelial cells supports the concept that these tumors are derived from pluripotential reserve cells.\r"

By definition, a hamartoma is a tissue mass, present at or near the time of birth, that is benign and native to the site of origin. Growth capacity of a hamartomatous process parallels that of the host organism. A choristoma, on the other hand, is a mass of tissue that is foreign to the site of discovery and is thought to result from growth to displaced primordial tissue that is histologically normal for that tissue.\r"

Apicoectomy was then performed, leaving bony defects at the apex of each root. The defects were either packed with Durapatite ceramic crystals or allowed to fill with blood. Each animal received at least one dose of Procion red, a hard-tissue marking agent. After healing periods of 2 to 6 months, the apices were examined clinically, radiographically, and histologically. The ceramic material was well tolerated clinically with no gross evidence of inflammation or rejection. Histologically, the material was biocompatible. Healing of the experimental sites consisted of an initial investment of the apatite crystals in fibrous connective tissue followed by eventual replacement of the connective tissue with bone. Despite its excellent biocompatibility, the material appeared to retard osteogenesis by its physical presence. Although the ceramic eventually became entrapped in bone, without an intervening layer of connective tissue, there was a significantly greater amount of new bone in control sites.\r"

Recordings were performed with a newly developed device. The radiographs were converted to digital images in the following way: (1) video camera recording of the radiograph obtained at first visit by the first examiner (A), (2) copying of the numeric image of this radiograph (B), (3) repeated video recording of this radiograph (C), (4) video recording of the radiograph obtained at first visit by the second examiner (D), and (5) video recording of the radiograph obtained after 3 months (E). Subtractions were performed between the images: B - A, C - A, D - A, and E - A. The standard deviation of the histogram for the distribution of gray shades in the subtraction images was used to evaluate noise in the image. The standard deviation was 1.3 between B - A, 2.8 between C - A, 4.0 between D - A, and 4.1 between E - A. Physical noise originating from the video camera and the analog-to-digital conversion process thus constituted the major part of noise seen in subtraction images performed between radiographs recorded with a time interval. This indicates that reproducible recordings could be performed with the present device, which, in combination with a subtraction program able to correct for some geometry and density differences, may aid the use of subtraction radiography in clinical trials.\r"

Significant differences were found among the techniques in cone cutting errors and remakes, vertical angulation errors and remakes, and total errors and remakes. Operator skill did not appear to influence the number or types of errors or remakes generated. Rectangular collimation techniques produced more errors than did the round collimation techniques.

Marked loss of myelin and axons in the nerve and/or sensory root were found in cases with and without pain. Some evidence is presented for a more generalized subacute or chronic inflammatory process which may explain the clinical features of some patients.

  ".W": "Spinal cord stimulation has evolved over the past 20 years into an easily implemented technique, with low morbidity, for the treatment of intractable, chronic pain in properly selected patients. We report our experience with a series of 62 patients implanted between 1983 and 1987, with percutaneous and laminectomy electrodes, and with single- and \"multi-channel\" (programmable, multi-contact) devices. Fifty had chronic, intractable low back and leg pain (\"failed back surgery syndrome,\" lumbar arachnoid fibrosis), five had spinal cord injuries, and seven \"peripheral\" pathology or stump pain. Statistical analysis of these and other patient characteristics and technical factors was undertaken to identify predictors of outcome. All patients were interviewed by a disinterested third party at a mean of 2.14 years following implantation. A majority of patients reported at least 50% sustained relief of pain and indicated that they would go through the procedure again for the same result. There was corresponding improvement in ability to perform various everyday activities, and decrease in use of analgesics. Ten of 40 failed back patients who were disabled before the procedure returned to work postoperatively. Superposition of stimulation paresthesias upon a patient's topography of pain was found to be a statistically significant predictor of successful relief of pain, by linear regression methods. Univariate and multivariate analysis of patient characteristics and technical factors as predictors of outcome demonstrated significant advantages for female patients, and for patients implanted with \"multi-channel\" devices. With these devices, electrode geometries with central cathode(s) flanked by rostral and caudal anode(s) were favored disproportionately. Technical improvements in implanted spinal cord stimulation devices, in particular the development of multi-contact percutaneous electrode arrays and supporting programmable electronics, have significantly improved clinical results.\r"

Fifty-three chronic pain patients were compared to 17 pain-free subjects with the following psychophysical and physiological indices: pain threshold (PTh), pain tolerance (PTol), verbal estimation of intensity and unpleasantness (intensity scale, IS; unpleasantness scale, US), threshold for intensity and unpleasantness (ITh and UTh), lower limb RIII nociceptive reflex (RIIITh and RIII frequency of occurrence). Chronic pain syndromes included neuropathic pain (n = 12), iodopathic pain (n = 12), myofascial syndromes (n = 9), headache (n = 9), and miscellaneous pain (n = 11). Chronic pain symptomatology was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS), a French MPQ adaptation (QDSA), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State Trait Inventory (STAI) and Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). No significant difference was observed between chronic pain patients and pain-free control groups and between patient subgroups for PTh, PTol and RIIITh. No significant correlation was found between experimental pain measures and clinical pain, anxiety or depression scores. However, the chronic pain patients had a higher threshold for unpleasantness and judged the suprathreshold stimuli significantly less intense and less unpleasant than the control group. These results are discussed in relation to diffuse noxious inhibitory controls and the adaptation level theory of chronic pain experience.\r"

  ".W": "The current study examined the ability of overt pain behavior and cognitive coping strategies to predict low back pain patients' subsequent response to lumbar sympathetic nerve blocks and interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation. Seventeen chronic low back pain patients participated in the study. Each was assessed regarding pretreatment overt pain behavior, cognitive coping strategies and pretreatment outcome measures. They then received interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation including lumbar sympathetic blocks. Findings showed that patients exhibited significant improvement in posttreatment outcome measures and specific responses to nerve blocks. Regression analyses revealed that cognitive coping strategies failed to demonstrate any predictive utility across blocks or outcome measures. In contrast, overt pain behavior observed during the first block was highly predictive of acute and chronic subjective pain associated with initial and subsequent blocks, as well as posttreatment outcome measures for interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation. The more overt pain behavior observed during block 1, the more acute and chronic subjective pain observed across blocks and the poorer subsequent treatment outcome measures. This predictive capability was demonstrated over and above that of other pretreatment measures such as pain duration, number of surgeries, and receipt of economic compensation. Given the small sample size results were viewed with caution. It was concluded, however, that overt pain behavior might well be a significant predictor variable for specific and combined interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation techniques.\r"

Most have focussed on populations which, unlike many in the United States today, are characterized by highly distinct ethnic groups. The study reported here interviewed 536 persons recently treated for forms of cancer known to cause significant pain. Pain was assessed using standard, well validated instruments, including Graphic Rating Scales anchored in several alternative time-frames and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The study took place in an area with a low proportion of recent immigrants and only small concentrations of distinct ethnic minorities. No statistically significant relationships were observed between ethnic identity and measures of pain sensation. However, pain described in affective terms according to the McGill Pain Questionnaire did vary among ethnicities. This observation suggests that cultures associated with specific ethnic identities still condition individual expression of pain despite the high degree of assimilation that has occurred among ethnic groups in the United States.\r"

All patients found the EI safe and simple to operate. The main reason for discontinuation was death (10 cases) or return to oral narcotics (8 cases). In 20 patients who were admitted to the hospital and were too ill to learn PCA, the EI was used for regular s.c. administration by nurses. Narcotics were administered every 4 h and extra doses were administered on a 'PRN' basis. Waiting time for a 'PRN' dose in 8 patients before starting the EI was 18 +/- 7 min; after the EI was started, it was 3 +/- 4 min (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the EI is safe, effective and inexpensive, and that it will be particularly useful in smaller hospitals and developing countries.\r"

Pain was referred to the maxillary tuberosity area and, when stronger, to the infraorbital and supraorbital regions. Sucrose was most effective in eliciting pain, whilst saline, citric acid and water had a minimal effect. Spatial or temporal summation of gustatory stimuli was associated with stronger pain of longer duration and shorter latency. Some of the pain characteristics were similar to those of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Thus, pain was elicited by innocuous ipsilateral stimuli, referred out of the stimulus zone, persisted beyond the period of stimulation and could be controlled with carbamazepine. We proposed a central neural mechanism for pain induction with convergence between gustatory stimuli afferents and pain pathways in the trigeminal system.\r"

  ".W": "While much evidence implicates substance P (SP), an endogenous neurokinin (NK), as a primary sensory transmitter of acute pain in mammalian spinal cord, its role in continuous (tonic) pain is less clear. Although glutamate is co-localized with SP in dorsal root ganglion neurons, its role in nociceptive processing is uncertain. While antagonists of NKs and excitatory amino acids (EAAs) have been found to be antinociceptive in some acute assays, they have not been tested against tonic pain. We hypothesize that: (1) NKs and EAAs contribute to signaling of tonic chemogenic nociception; and (2) interaction between NK and EAA systems is important in determining the perceived intensity of a continuous noxious stimulus. We therefore evaluated two NK antagonists ([D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9] SP (DPDT-SP, 0.26-6.6 nmoles, non-specific) and [D-Pro4, D-Trp7,9,10,Phe11]-SP(4-11) (DPDTP-octa, 1.6-12.3 nmoles, somewhat NK-1 selective], as well as DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-AP5, NMDA antagonist, 0.05-1 nmole) and urethane (a kainic acid (KA) antagonist at 2.5 mumoles) for antinociceptive activity in the mouse formalin model. Administered intrathecally (i.t.), DL-AP5 and both NK antagonists were significantly antinociceptive while urethane (2.5 mumoles) and naloxone (2.7 nmoles) were inactive. A50 values for mean % analgesia, nmoles/mouse i.t. (95% CLs) were: DPDT-SP, 1.1 (0.79-1.6); DPDTP-octa, 3.9 (2.4-6.1); DL-AP5, 0.29 (0.16-0.71). The antinociception associated with 1.3 nmoles of DPDT-SP was not reversed by co-administering 2.7 nmoles of naloxone. Co-administration of 0.1 nmoles of DL-AP5 with either 1.3 nmoles of DPDT-SP or 3.3 nmoles of DPDTP-octa did not lead to additive antinociception.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One-third of the cells exhibited expansion of their receptive fields as defined using mechanical stimuli following a spinal kappa agonist (dynorphin or U-50,488H); receptive field expansions were of the same order as those observed immediately after a conditioning electrical stimulus applied to a peripheral nerve. In addition, spinal U-50,488H produced changes in mechanical and thermal thresholds of the majority of superficial dorsal horn neurons. These changes were dose-dependent. Facilitation of responses occurred at lower doses and inhibition occurred primarily at higher doses, but these effects were not reversed by subsequent administration of naloxone. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that one action of increases in spinal dynorphin levels due to peripheral inflammation, tissue injury or nerve damage, is to contribute to enhanced neuronal excitability in superficial dorsal horn neurons.\r"

It is reported here that APtN stimulation effectively inhibited responses to briefly applied noxious pressure and longer-lasting noxious chemical (formalin) stimuli. Although the tail-flick reflex to noxious heat was very potently depressed by APtN stimulation, responses to noxious heat in the hot-plate test were not. Three doses of morphine were also studied with each test and it was concluded that 15 sec of 35 microA r.m.s. current into the APtN was as effective as 3-5 mg/kg morphine s.c. in the rat.\r"

The present study examined the effects of electrical stimulation of the subdiaphragmatic vagus (SDV) on the nociceptive tail-flick reflex, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate in rats lightly anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. The intensity of SDV stimulation (20 Hz, 2 msec) necessary to inhibit the tail-flick reflex to a 10 sec cut-off latency for 3 consecutive trials was defined as the threshold to produce antinociception. Electrical stimulation of the SDV suppressed the tail-flick reflex in a linear, intensity-dependent manner. In addition, the threshold varied as a function of either the frequency or the pulse width of SDV stimulation, such that decreases in either frequency or pulse width, from 20 Hz and 2 msec, respectively, systematically increased the threshold current necessary to produce antinociception. SDV stimulation also produced modest decreases in heart rate (HR), but arterial blood pressure (ABP) responses were highly variable in both the magnitude and direction of change. Intrathecal administration of 30 micrograms of the serotonergic receptor antagonist methysergide significantly increased the threshold for antinociception produced by SDV stimulation from 80 to 938.8 microA, whereas 15 micrograms of methysergide had no significant effect. Intrathecal administration of saline, 30 micrograms of naloxone, or 30 micrograms of phentolamine had no significant effect on the threshold of SDV stimulation required to produce antinociception. Systemic administration of naloxone (4 mg/kg i.p. or i.v.) also had no effect on the antinociceptive threshold. Intrathecal administration of these receptor antagonists had no significant effect on the ABP and HR responses produced by electrical stimulation of the SDV at the threshold intensity producing antinociception.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 284 cases the Port-A-Cath was implanted for epidural delivery of morphine in patients with cancer-related pain. These patients were treated for a mean of 96 (range 1-1215) days. There was a wide variation in dose requirements, minimum daily dose ranging from 0.5 to 200 mg and maximum daily dose from 1 to 3072 mg. However, there was no clear trend to increasing dose as period of epidural morphine administration increased. The most frequent complications were pain on injection (12.0% incidence), occlusion of the portal system (10.9%), infection (8.1%) and leakage of administered morphine such that it did not all reach the epidural space (2.1%). In all but 1 case infections were limited to the area around the portal or along the catheter track. All infections resolved without sequelae following removal of the portal and/or administration of antibiotics. In 17 patients Port-A-Caths were implanted for the intrathecal delivery of morphine to control cancer-related pain. These patients also exhibited wide variations in morphine dose requirements. Port-A-Caths were also implanted for delivery of spinal morphine in 12 patients with chronic pain which was not related to cancer and which failed to respond to other therapies. These patients were treated for a mean of 155 (range 2-575) days. Port-A-Caths were removed from 7 of these patients, primarily due to infection (2 cases) and inadequate pain relief and pain on injection (2 cases).\r"

Although a remarkable lack of correlation between patient, stimulator and outcome variables was found to exist, the analysis revealed much information of importance: 47% of patients found TENS reduced their pain by more than half; TENS analgesia was rapid both in onset (less than 0.5 h in 75% patients) and in offset (less than 0.5 h in 51% patients); one-third of patients utilised TENS for over 61 h/week; pulse frequencies between 1 and 70 Hz were utilised by 75% of patients; 44% of patients benefitted from burst mode stimulation. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

The results show that patients prefer specific pulse frequencies and pulse patterns unique to the individual and that they turn to such frequencies and patterns on subsequent treatment sessions. Pulse frequencies and pulse patterns were not related to the cause and site of pain, a finding consistent with previous study in this laboratory. This observation, coupled with the large variability in pulse frequencies and pulse patterns used between individuals, implies that patients prefer such frequencies and patterns for reasons of comfort which may not be related to mechanisms specific to the pain system.\r"

  ".W": "Deep pain thresholds of the tender points in man were measured by pulse algometry. In this technique an insulated acupuncture needle (180 microns in diameter, about 400 k omega at 1 kHz) was used as a cathodal monopolar stimulating electrode. The stimulus consisted of a short train (three 1 msec duration pulses at 500 Hz) repeated at 2 Hz, and the current intensity was increased at a constant rate by a command voltage supplied to the stimulator. The stimulus current was monitored on an oscilloscope, and the integrated current was recorded simultaneously on a chart recorder. The tender points were detected by careful palpation, a pressure algometer being used to quantify threshold intensities. The needle electrode was inserted into the same points and deep pain thresholds were measured every 1-2 mm in depth. The deep pain thresholds at the depth where the experimenter felt some stiffness against the needle insertion (what we have termed needling stiffness) were 0.9 +/- 0.1 mA (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 14). Threshold values determined by repetitive measurements at the same position at intervals of 5 min for 6 successive trials were very similar. The stimulus evoked sensation was a dull-heavy deep pain. The pain thresholds changed markedly as the depth of the electrode tip was changed by 1-2 mm (P less than 0.01, t test). The minimum pain threshold under the tender point occurred at the depth of the needling stiffness. Observations with an ultrasonic image scanner suggested that the needle tip was located on or near the fascia when the experimenter felt the needling stiffness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixty patients did not receive acupuncture and participated as a control group (CG). All patients completed a questionnaire in order to characterize state tension and stress, degrees of neuroticism, extroversion, depression and psychosomatic disorders. We also recorded intraoperative discomfort and pain intensity, postoperative pain intensity and consumption of analgesics for 72 h. The PRE-ACU was significantly more tense following surgery and found the operative procedure more unpleasant than the other two groups. The PRE-ACU further rated intraoperative pain intensity higher than the CG and experienced higher pain intensity immediately postoperatively compared with POST-ACU and CG. Of the PRE-ACU patients 15/24 needed additional local anesthesia intraoperatively while none in the POST-ACU or CG requested extra lidocaine. Postoperatively patients in both PRE- and POST-ACU reported a higher total sum of pain scores (pain intensity) and the PRE-ACU consumed more analgesics compared with the CG. A significantly larger number of patients suffering from \"dry socket\" (a complication during wound healing) was found in both PRE- and POST-ACU compared with the CG. No correlation was found between assessed personality characteristics and reported postoperative pain/consumption of analgesics in any group and could thus not explain the observed differences between the groups. The reason for our unexpected \"negative\" findings is unclear but some hypothetical explanations are discussed.\r"

The study included a comparison of visual analogue and magnitude matching rating procedures, as well as a test of simulated analgesia, in which the range of stimuli presented during the 2 experimental sessions was shifted by 1 degree C. We found that females rated noxious heat stimuli as more intense than did males, independent of the gender of the experimenter or the type of rating scale. In addition, the data suggest that females discriminate among the painful heat intensities better than males. For example, female subjects showed significant between-session discrimination of noxious heat stimuli, while male subjects did not, and females produced steeper within-session stimulus-response functions than did males. These observed differences in nociceptive discrimination between males and females indicate that the sex-related variation in pain perception is probably related to sensory factors rather than differences in attitude or emotional response.\r"

Identification of factors that influence coping could potentially help clinicians facilitate the use of adaptive coping strategies by pain patients. According to social learning theory, self-efficacy beliefs (judgments regarding one's capabilities) and outcome expectancies (judgments regarding the consequences of behaviors) are significant determinants of coping behavior. This study tested hypotheses derived from social learning theory by examining the contributions of these beliefs to the prediction of coping behavior in chronic pain patients. One hundred and fourteen chronic pain patients completed measures of health-related dysfunction, pain severity, use of 8 coping strategies, and outcome and self-efficacy expectancies regarding these coping strategies. In support of social learning theory, and consistent with research in other areas, the patients' beliefs regarding their capabilities were strongly related to reported coping efforts. Beliefs about the consequences of coping efforts and their interaction with beliefs about capabilities were generally unrelated to coping. These results suggest that treatment should emphasize the actual practice and use of adaptive coping strategies over education about their outcome.\r"

Chronic pain sufferers in multiple settings and control subjects participated in this study in which the relationships between pain and 20 psychological variables were examined. Pain was defined and assessed in 3 different ways: (1) membership in a pain group, (2) number of specialists consulted for pain, and (3) pain intensity. Of the 20 psychological variables examined, only less emotional repression and greater \"ergomania\" (excessive work) were consistently associated with pain on all 3 pain criteria. In addition, pain patients were more likely to have had a relative with pain. Comparisons of pain patients in different settings showed that pain clinic patients reported having been more active throughout their lives, but were currently more depressed and experienced less life satisfaction than patients who were not in a specialized pain centre. These results are interpreted in the light of current multicausal views of pain and conclusions are drawn about the role of psychological variables both as risk factors in, and as consequences of pain.\r"

Interruption of the subcortical parietal white matter may more effectively control pain than cortical lesions. A few surgeons have successfully treated rebellious chronic pain with stereotaxic operations in the corona radiata, resulting in lesions very similar to our patient's. This overlooked and nearly forgotten technique may still have value in treating selected cases.\r"

Our study attempted to assess the frequency and character of phantom rectum. All surviving patients (n = 22), who had undergone abdominoperineal surgical resection of the rectum in the period 1980-1986 at our clinic, were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and underwent a physical examination. Sixty-eight per cent of the patients experienced a sensation of a missing rectum (phantom rectum), and in 27% of these or 18% of all patients this sensation was painful (phantom pain). The most common symptoms were sensations of flatus and/or faeces in a normal rectum, phantom flatus or phantom faeces. The phantom pains were described as either pricking and shooting or like haemorrhoids or hard stools that would rupture the rectum. Neither age, sex, preoperative pain, the Duke classification of the tumour nor the healing of the perineal wound seemed related to the likelihood of phantom rectum. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying phantom-related phenomena following amputation have not yet been elucidated. This study describes a relatively unknown phantom-related clinical entity after amputation and may thus contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Repetitive stimulation of small diameter primary afferent fibres produces a progressive increase in action potential discharge (windup) and a prolonged increase in the excitability of neurones in the spinal cord following the stimulus. Previous studies have demonstrated that windup is the consequence of the temporal summation of slow synaptic potentials and that the slow potentials and windup are reduced by pretreatment with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists. We have now examined whether primary afferent induced hypersensitivity states in flexor motoneurones are also dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors and whether windup is a possible trigger for the production of the central hypersensitivity. Both a non-competitive (MK-801) and a competitive (D-CPP) NMDA antagonist, at doses that did not modify the baseline reflex, reduced the facilitation of the flexor reflex produced by either brief electrical stimulation of the sural nerve (1 Hz for 20 sec at C-fibre strength), or by the cutaneous application of the chemical irritant mustard oil. These antagonists also prevented windup from occurring in the motoneurones. When the the MK-801 and the D-CPP were administered once a state of central facilitation had been induced by prior treatment with mustard oil, they returned the facilitated reflex to its pretreatment level. These results indicate that NMDA receptors are involved in the induction and maintenance of the central sensitization produced by high threshold primary afferent inputs. Because central sensitization is likely to contribute to the post-injury pain hypersensitivity states in man, these data have a bearing both on the potential role of NMDA antagonists for pre-emptive analgesia and for treating established pain states.\r"

  ".W": "Capsaicin has been used extensively as an experimental tool and in traditional and proprietary topical medications for acute soft tissue injuries. More recently it has been prescribed for several chronic pain conditions where it is usually administered topically for periods of several weeks. Here we have studied the consequences of this mode of application in the rat. Capsaicin cream (0.075% or 0.75%), or a vehicle cream, was applied twice daily to the hind paws of rats for a continuous period of 10 weeks. The hind paws treated with 0.75% capsaicin (but not 0.075%) because transiently hyperalgesic, but there were no signs of discomfort or distress associated with the treatment. After 10 weeks of capsaicin application, the ability of C fibres to produce neurogenic extravasation was markedly reduced. After 4 weeks of recovery this ability returned to normal in 0.075% capsaicin-treated animals, but remained impaired in the 0.75% group. This latter group showed a partial recovery 12 weeks after the end of treatment. The levels of substance P and CGRP in the sural nerve supplying the treated skin area were unchanged after both the 0.075% and 0.75% capsaicin treatments. The results suggest that the topical application of capsaicin at low concentration produces a reversible impairment of the terminals of C fibres in the skin without greatly exciting those fibres and without affecting the properties of cell soma. The number of afferent neurones in the L5 dorsal root ganglion projecting through the sural nerve was unchanged after 0.75% capsaicin treatment, suggesting that the topical capsaicin treatment does not produce any cell death in the adult animal.\r"

Responses of 8 (36%) STT neurons to noxious stimuli were only inhibited by VAS, 9 (41%) were facilitated at lesser and inhibited at greater intensities of VAS, and 5 units (23%) were only facilitated by VAS. There were no significant differences in VAS-produced modulatory effects between STT neurons and 16 unidentified lumbar spinal dorsal horn neurons studied under the same conditions. These results reveal that descending facilitatory and inhibitory pathways engaged by activation of vagal afferents modulate rostrally projecting nociceptive transmission neurons in the spinal cord, constituting an important regulatory network for nociception.\r"

An intrathecal injection of antiserum against porcine galanin reversed the decreased nociceptive threshold for mechanical, but not thermal, stimulation of the carrageenin-treated hind paw of rat, with no effect on the nociceptive threshold of the non-inflamed hind paw. Rat galanin as well as porcine galanin suppressed the binding of [125I]porcine galanin to the antiserum, a finding suggesting that the antiserum can bind rat galanin. An intrathecal injection of porcine galanin (0.1 and 1 nmol, but not 0.01 nmol) decreased the mechanical nociceptive threshold of the rat hind paw with no effect on thermal nociception. These results suggest that galanin present in the dorsal horn is involved in the facilitation of mechanical, but not thermal, nociceptive transmission.\r"

  ".W": "Acetohydroxyacid synthase [AHAS; acetolactate pyruvate-lyase (carboxylating), EC 4.1.3.18], the first enzyme unique to the biosynthesis of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, is a known target for several different chemical classes of herbicides. Antibodies required for immunological characterization of the enzyme have not been generated by the conventional method of antibody production using purified protein. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against AHAS from corn by using as immunogen a synthetic peptide representing this enzyme. This antibody immunoprecipitated the enzyme activity from corn. On a Western blot, a protein band with a molecular weight of 65,000 was detected in crude extracts of corn. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity gel was used to isolate a single protein from crude enzyme preparations that migrated at Mr 65,000 in an SDS/polyacrylamide gel. The molecular weight of this protein band is the molecular weight predicted for a plant AHAS from a cloned gene sequence. These results strongly suggest that the Mr 65,000 protein represents AHAS in corn extracts. Interestingly, the monoclonal antibody specifically recognized the enzyme from monocots and did not crossreact with AHAS from any dicot species tested. Identification of this monoclonal antibody that distinguishes monocot and dicot AHAS is significant because of a very high degree of amino acid conservation (85%) between AHAS proteins from different species.\r"

  ".W": "The mitogenic neuropeptides bombesin and vasopressin markedly increased tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of multiple substrates in quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, including two major bands of Mr 90,000 and 115,000. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was increased as judged by immunoprecipitation of 32Pi-labeled cells and immunoblotting of unlabeled cells with monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, elution with phenyl phosphate, and phospho amino acid analysis. Phosphotyrosyl proteins generated by bombesin and vasopressin did not correspond either by apparent molecular weight or by immunological and biochemical criteria to several known tyrosine kinase substrates, including phospholipase C gamma, the microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase, GTPase-activating protein, or phosphatidylinositol kinase. The effect was rapid (within seconds), concentration dependent, and inhibited by specific receptor antagonists for both bombesin and vasopressin. The endothelin-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal contractor, also elicited a rapid and concentration-dependent tyrosine/serine phosphorylation of a similar set of substrates. These results demonstrate that neuropeptides, acting through receptors linked to GTP-binding proteins, stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of a common set of substrates in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells and suggest the existence of an additional signal transduction pathway in neuropeptide-induced mitogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin A and other retinoids profoundly inhibit morphological and biochemical features of epidermal differentiation in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential expression of epidermal keratins and their regulation by retinoids, we examined retinoid-mediated changes in total protein expression, protein synthesis, mRNA expression, and transcription in cultured human keratinocytes and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-13) cells of epidermal origin. Our studies revealed that the epidermal keratins, K5, K6, K14, and K16, their mRNAs, and their transcripts were diminished relative to actin as a consequence of retinoic acid (RA) treatment. The effects were most pronounced in SCC-13 and were detected as early as 6 hr post-RA treatment, with enhancement over an additional 24-48 hr. Repression was also observed when 5' upstream sequences of K14 or K5 genes were used to drive expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in SCC-13 keratinocytes. Both cell types were found to express mRNAs for the RA receptors alpha and gamma, which may be involved in the RA-mediated transcriptional changes in these cells. The rapid transcriptional changes in epidermal keratin genes were in striking contrast to the previously reported slow transcriptional changes in simple epithelial keratin genes.\r"

Cytol. 19, 289-302]. We have characterized two P transcripts that are alternatively spliced at their 3' ends. One message of 1802 nucleotides encodes a 43.7-kDa protein with an N-terminal region showing approximately 40% homology to the DNA-binding domain of several members of the myb family of protooncogene proteins. A second message of 945 nucleotides encodes a 17.3-kDa protein that contains most of the myb-homologous domain but differs from the first protein at the C terminus. The deduced P-encoded proteins show an even higher homology (70%) in the myb-homologous domain to the maize regulatory gene C1. Additionally, the P and C1 genes are structurally similar in the sizes and positions of the first and second exons and first intron. We show that P is required for accumulation in the pericarp of transcripts of two genes (A1 and C2) encoding enzymes for flavonoid biosynthesis--genes also regulated by C1 in the aleurone.\r"

An EcoRV restriction fragment difference between laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] and M. spretus was detected after amplification of Zfx transcripts using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Using this allelic variation, we assessed expression of the two Zfx genes in females carrying the T(X;16)16H translocation (from laboratory strain of mouse [corrected]) and an intact X chromosome (from M. spretus). Such females exhibit Zfx transcription from the active laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] chromosome but not from the inactive M. spretus chromosome. These results indicate that the mouse Zfx gene is subject to X inactivation.\r"

The DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein of Mr 79,461 and lacking significant sequence similarity to any protein in data bases. Disruption of DPB2 was lethal for the cell and the temperature-sensitive dpb2-1 mutant was partially defective in DNA synthesis at the restrictive temperature, indicating that the DPB2 protein is required for normal yeast chromosomal replication. Furthermore, the DNA polymerase II complex was difficult to obtain from dpb2-1 mutant cells, suggesting that a stable DNA polymerase II complex requires DPB2 and is essential for chromosomal replication. The DPB2 transcript periodically fluctuated during the cell cycle and, like those of other genes encoding DNA replication proteins, peaked at the G1/S phase boundary.\r"

We now demonstrate that alpha 2 is conjugated to ubiquitin in vivo. More than one lysine residue of alpha 2 can be joined to ubiquitin, and some of the ubiquitin moieties form a Lys48-linked multiubiquitin chain. Overexpression of degradation-impaired ubiquitin variants was used to show that at least a significant fraction of alpha 2 degradation is dependent on its ubiquitination.\r"

  ".U": "91271243\r", 
  ".W": "The development of T-cell lymphomas in rodents infected with type C retroviruses has been linked to the generation of a class of envelope (env) recombinant viruses called mink cell focus-forming viruses (MCF viruses) in the preleukemic thymus. To determine whether infection by MCF viruses altered the growth phenotype of retrovirus-induced T-cell lymphomas, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent rat T-cell lymphoma line (4437A) was infected with MCF-247, modified MCF-V33 (mMCF-V33), or NZB-xenotropic (NZB-X) virus. The effects of virus infection on the IL-2 dependence of these cells was examined by cultivating them in the absence of IL-2. After IL-2 withdrawal, the uninfected and NZB-X-infected cells went through a crisis period characterized by massive death. All the independently maintained cultures of MCF- and mMCF-V33-infected cells, on the other hand, became IL-2 independent without a crisis. All the polytropic virus-infected IL-2-independent cultures contained a population of cells that was polyclonal with regard to polytropic provirus integration. Over this polyclonal background each culture produced multiple clones of cells that were selected rapidly after IL-2 withdrawal. Furthermore, the resulting MCF- or mMCF-V33-infected IL-2-independent cells retained the expression of IL-2 receptor. These data show that MCF and mMCF-V33 viruses may alter the growth phenotype of a T-cell lymphoma line and suggest that their effect on cell growth may be due to the direct interaction of the MCF envelope glycoprotein with cellular components, perhaps the IL-2 receptor.\r"

We have utilized the simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac)-infected rhesus monkeys to explore another possible therapeutic application of CD4 in AIDS--the use of recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4) as an immunogen. SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys immunized with human rsCD4 developed not only an anti-human CD4 but also an anti-rhesus monkey CD4 antibody response. Coincident with the generation of this antibody response, SIVmac could not be isolated easily from peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow macrophages of these animals. Furthermore, the decreased number of both granulocyte/macrophage and erythrocyte colonies grown from the bone marrow of these immunized monkeys rose to normal levels. These findings suggest that a modified human CD4 molecule serving as an immunogen might elicit an antibody response in man that could induce a beneficial therapeutic response in HIV-infected individuals.\r"

The N-terminal peptides lyse liposomes and nucleated cells, and they form ion channels in planar bilayers, some of which are comparable to those previously described for perforin. The lytic activity of the N-terminal domains does not require calcium, is independent of the lipid headgroup composition, and can be inhibited by heparin. Tumor cells incubated with the N-terminal peptides undergo the same morphological changes as those induced by native perforin. None of the peptides corresponding to the putative membrane-spanning domains from the central region of perforin is cytolytic. Taken together, these results suggest that the N-terminal region is an important part of the pore-forming domain of perforin.\r"

Despite the lack of binding to p55, all analogs exhibited significant biological activity, as assayed on the murine CTLL cell line. The dissociation constants of Arg-38 and Phe-42 analogs for p70 were consistent with intermediate-affinity binding; the Kd values were not significantly affected by the presence of p55 in binding to the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex.

Efforts to develop serologic assays and vaccine development have been hampered by the virus's extreme tropism for human bone marrow and the absence of a convenient culture system. We constructed recombinants containing either the major (VP2) or minor (VP1) structural proteins of B19 in a baculovirus-based plasmid, from which the polyhedrin gene had been deleted; these recombinant plasmids were used to generate recombinant infectious baculovirus. Subsequent infection of insect cells in vitro resulted in high-level expression of either B19VP1 or VP2. Parvovirus capsids were obtained by self-assembly in cell cultures coinfected with either VP1- and VP2-containing baculoviruses or, surprisingly, VP2-containing baculoviruses alone. Empty B19 capsids composed of VP1 and VP2 could replace serum virus as a source of antigen in a conventional immunoassay for detection of either IgG or IgM antiparvovirus antibodies in human serum. Immunization of rabbits with capsids composed of VP1 and VP2 resulted in production of antisera that recognized serum parvovirus on immunoblot and neutralized parvovirus infectivity for human erythroid progenitor cells. Baculovirus-derived parvovirus antigen can substitute for scarce viral antigen in immunoassays and should be suitable as a human vaccine.\r"

This was accomplished by superfusing a cat mesenteric preparation with inhibitors of NO production, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and observing single (30-microns diameter) venules by intravital video microscopy. Thirty minutes into the superfusion period the number of adherent and emigrated leukocytes, the erythrocyte velocity, and the venular diameter were measured; venular blood flow and shear rate were calculated from the measured parameters. The contribution of the leukocyte adhesion glycoprotein CD11/CD18 was determined using the CD18-specific monoclonal antibody IB4. Both inhibitors of NO production increased leukocyte adherence more than 15-fold. Leukocyte emigration was also enhanced, whereas venular shear rate was reduced by nearly half. Antibody IB4 abolished the leukocyte adhesion induced by L-NMMA and L-NAME. Incubation of isolated cat neutrophils with L-NMMA, but not L-NAME, resulted in direct upregulation of CD11/CD18 as assessed by flow cytometry. Decrements in venular shear rate induced by partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery in untreated animals revealed that only a minor component of L-NAME-induced leukocyte adhesion was shear rate-dependent. The L-NAME-induced adhesion was inhibited by L-arginine but not D-arginine. These data suggest that endothelium-derived NO may be an important endogenous modulator of leukocyte adherence and that impairment of NO production results in a pattern of leukocyte adhesion and emigration that is characteristic of acute inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Glutathione deficiency in newborn rats, produced by administration of L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, a transition-state inactivator of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, decreases ascorbate levels of kidney, liver, brain, and lung. These tissues, especially their mitochondria, undergo severe damage and the animals die within a few days. When glutathione levels are markedly decreased, ascorbate levels decrease leading to formation of dehydroascorbate, which is degraded. Ascorbate has high antioxidant activity, but it (and other antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol) must be maintained in reduced forms. These studies show in vivo that an important function of glutathione is to maintain tissue ascorbate. Administration of large doses of ascorbate (but not of dehydroascorbate) to buthionine sulfoximine-treated newborn rats decreases mortality, leads to normal levels of ascorbate, and spares glutathione. Newborn rats given lower doses of buthionine sulfoximine develop cataracts that, as shown previously, can be prevented by giving glutathione monoester; as found here, such cataracts can be partially prevented by administration of high doses of ascorbate or dehydroascorbate. Ascorbate spares glutathione indicating that these compounds have similar antioxidant actions. Ascorbate may have reductive functions that are not efficiently performed by glutathione. Although glutathione normally functions to maintain ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol, and other cellular components in reduced states, ascorbate can serve as an essential antioxidant in the presence of severe glutathione deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography and fluorescence spectroscopy, we investigated the kinetics of fluorescent peptide reactions with detergent-solubilized I-Ad, a class II molecule of the mouse major histocompatibility complex. At pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C the half-time for the binding of a fluorescein-labeled synthetic peptide representing ovalbumin amino acids 323-339 [FOva-(323-339)Y] to I-Ad was 32 hr, independent of added fluorescent peptide concentration in the range 5-200 microM. Peptide exchange experiments were also carried out, where it was found that the half-time of FOva-(323-339)Y binding was equal to the half-time of dissociation of the Texas Red-labeled peptide TROva-(323-339)Y. These experiments show that slow peptide binding to class II major histocompatibility molecules may be limited by the slow dissociation of prebound peptides. Paradoxically, however, this kinetic behavior--a peptide concentration-insensitive on-reaction with a half-time for peptide binding approximately equal to the half-time for dissociation--can be modeled in more than one way. Models involving a kinetic intermediate are particularly attractive. The kinetics were significantly different at pH 5.0. The half-times for peptide binding and dissociation were approximately 7 times shorter than at pH 7.0. In addition the complex of the I-Ad alpha/beta heterodimer with FOva-(323-339)Y was unstable and dissociated into separate alpha and beta chains with a half-time of approximately 7 hr.\r"

In this report we show that Peromyscus leucopus, a Cricetidae rodent, has MHC class I genes (Pele-A genes) encoding three distinct sizes of TMs. Increases in TM lengths were due to tandem duplications of sequences similar to human hypervariable minisatellite repeats and the lambda chi site. We discerned remnants of a similar duplication event in comparable rodent and primate MHC class I genes. Furthermore, several duplications and deletions appear to have occurred independently in H-2, RT1, Pele-A, and ChLA genes in near-identical positions. Accumulated data suggests that sequences in the fifth exon of MHC class I genes may, therefore, constitute a mutational or recombinational hot spot that is mediated by minisatellite- and chi-like sequences imbedded within the coding region. The MHC class I genes may thus have recruited \"selfish\" DNA in their evolution to encode cell surface proteins. Expression of Pele-A genes was examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers specific for exon 4 and 5 sequences. The PCR product sizes indicated that genes encoding each TM domain length are ubiquitously transcribed.\r"

The nature of the Sld mutation was investigated at the molecular level and was found to be due to a 4.0-kilobase intragenic deletion in mast cell growth factor (MGF) genomic sequences, providing conclusive evidence that Sl encodes MGF. As a consequence of this deletion, Sld is only capable of encoding a soluble truncated growth factor that lacks both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Northern analysis indicates that Sld mRNA is expressed at approximately wild-type levels in adult tissues, and yeast expression studies suggest that the Sld protein is as biologically active as wild-type soluble MGF. These studies provide a molecular basis for explaining the Sld phenotype, a description of a germ-line mutation in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of a membrane-bound growth factor, and in vivo evidence for the importance of membrane-bound forms of growth factors in mammalian development.\r"

To characterize the regulatory region controlling DAF gene transcription, genomic DNA extending from 815 base pairs (bp) upstream to approximately 4 kilobases downstream of DAF's AUG codon (designated +1) was cloned and sequenced. The 5' flanking sequence showed 59-76% G + C content (-355 to +1), at least one GC box(es) (-135 to -131), and variable length sequences (from -629 to -285) conforming to the motifs TCCTCC and TCn.

In COS cell transfections, the sequence encompassing -815 to -67 functioned 2.5% as efficiently as the Rous sarcoma virus 3' long terminal repeat, but following deletion upstream of -355 its activity increased approximately 4-fold. Two octanucleotides exhibiting partial homology to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and cAMP responsive elements (PREs and CREs, respectively) were detected, and the respective modulators enhanced transcriptional efficiency 2- and approximately 10-fold, respectively. Thus, the DAF gene promoter (i) exhibits sequences resembling both conventional and unconventional transcriptional control elements, (ii) possesses a region with negative regulatory activity, and (iii) responds to PMA and cAMP induction presumably via PRE- and CRE-like enhancer elements.\r"

Severe reperfusion arrhythmia--ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia--were prominent in control hearts, and their duration was significantly reduced by the presence of 0.4 or 1 mM TEMPO. TEMPO also repressed both postischemic release of lactate dehydrogenase and OH. formation. TEMPO slowed the heart rate, but compensatory pacing did not alter the dramatic effect of the nitroxide on reperfusion arrhythmia. TEMPO was partially protective when introduced at the end of ischemia but had no effect when added 1 min into reperfusion. It was concluded that both reperfusion arrhythmia and cell damage were directly related to oxidative damage incurred during the critical first minute of reperfusion. TEMPO strongly protected against reperfusion injury by preventing the formation of OH. and not by decreasing heart rate or by direct suppression of arrhythmia.\r"

Duplexes containing 8-oxodG positioned opposite dC, dG, or dT were cleaved, whereas single-stranded DNA and duplexes containing 8-oxodG.dA or 8-oxodA positioned opposite any of the four DNA bases were relatively resistant. Both enzymes cut duplexes containing 8-oxoG.dC 3' and 5' to the modified base but failed to cleave duplex DNA containing synthetic abasic sites, mismatches containing dG, or unmodified DNA. 8-Oxoguanine, identified by HPLC-electrochemical detection techniques, was released during the enzymatic reaction. Apparent Km values for FPG protein acting on duplex substrates containing a single Me-Fapy or 8-oxodG residue positioned opposite dC were 41 and 8 nM, respectively, and those for 8-hydroxyguanine endonuclease were 30 and 13 nM, respectively. Comparison of the properties of the two enzyme activities suggest that they are identical. In view of the widespread distribution of 8-oxodG in cellular DNA, the demonstrated miscoding and mutagenic properties of this lesion, and the existence of a bacterial gene coding for FPG protein, we propose that 8-oxodG DNA is the primary physiological substrate for a constituent glycosylase found in bacteria and mammalian cells.\r"

Most of the phosphodiester linkages between IN and DNA involve serine, but some involve threonine. Computer-assisted alignment of 80 retroviral and retrotransposon IN sequences identified one serine that is conserved in all of these proteins and three less-conserved threonine residues. These results identify candidate active-site residues and provide support for the participation of a covalent IN-DNA intermediate in retroviral integration.\r"

In addition, both clones were markedly impaired in their ability to differentiate into adipocytes. The defect in adipocyte-specific differentiation was corrected by expression of transfected human insulin receptor cDNA.

  ".U": "91271267\r", 
  ".W": "Adrenal mitochondria possess two steroidogenic cytochrome P450s. P450c11 converts deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone and aldosterone, and P450scc converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. These P450s receive electrons from NADPH via adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin. A single bovine P450c11 protein has 11-hydroxylase, 18-hydroxylase, and 18-oxidase activities, but this series of enzymatic steps may be mediated by more than one enzyme in rats. Enzymatic assays of purified rat mitochondrial proteins have suggested that one enzyme found in all zones of the adrenal cortex has both 11- and 18-hydroxylase activities, whereas another enzyme, found exclusively in the zona glomerulosa, catalyzes 18-hydroxylation and 18-oxidation of corticosterone. We studied the number and zonal distribution of P450c11 mRNA species in the rat adrenal and how these mRNAs are regulated in the adrenals of normal and pregnant rats. Rats synthesize two similar, but distinct, P450c11 mRNAs. One, P450c11A, is found in both the zona glomerulosa and fasciculata/reticularis, whereas the second, P450c11B, is found only in the zona glomerulosa. The abundance of neither P450c11A mRNA nor P450c11B mRNA is affected by a high-salt diet. However, when rats receive a low-salt diet, P450c11A mRNA decreases and P450c11B mRNA increases. Dexamethasone decreases the amount of P450c11A mRNA without affecting P450c11B mRNA. The combination of a high-salt diet and dexamethasone decreases the amount of both mRNAs further to almost undetectable amounts. Rats given a low-salt diet and dexamethasone have a dramatic increase in the abundance of P450c11B mRNA. Thus both forms of P450c11 mRNA are regulated independently in the rat adrenal cortex. In situ hybridization studies show that only the P450c11 found in the zona glomerulosa is regulated by salt treatment in vivo, whereas glucocorticoid treatment in vivo regulates P450c11 in all zones. In the adrenals of pregnant rats, P450c11B is regulated in a similar fashion to its regulation in the nonpregnant rat adrenal, despite major differences in sodium retention and intravascular volume in pregnant and nonpregnant rats. In the pregnant rat, a low-salt diet increases the abundance of P450c11B to a greater degree than in the nonpregnant rat. By contrast, dexamethasone does not diminish the abundance of P450c11A mRNA in the pregnant rat but reduces it to an almost undetectable amount in the nonpregnant rat. Thus, the regulation of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production in the pregnant and nonpregnant rat occurs by different mechanisms.\r"

In this target brain region, the tg locus transforms neuronal excitability without altering measured intrinsic membrane properties, indicating that gene control of inherited epileptic traits may be mediated in part by activity-dependent modulation of network behavior favoring synchronous neuronal firing.\r"

Continued acid titration with HCl or HBr but not H2SO4 restores the purple chromophore to yield bRHCl564 or bRHBr568. These acid purple forms also regain transmembrane charge transport, but no transient Schiff base deprotonation is observed. In contrast to bR568, no rate decrease of the bRacidpurple transport kinetics is detected in 2H2O; however, the transport rate decreases by a factor of approximately 2 in bRHBr568 compared with bRHCl564.

Although the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complex is known to constitute the platelet's ristocetin-dependent receptor for vWF, a unique structural abnormality within this complex has not previously been identified in PT-vWD. Using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify genomic DNA coding for the alpha chain of GP Ib (GP Ib alpha) and then sequencing the amplified DNA following cloning into M13mp18 and M13mp19 phage vectors, we have found a single point mutation in the GP Ib alpha coding region of PT-vWD DNA resulting in the substitution of valine for glycine at residue 233. This substitution within the vWF-binding region of GP Ib alpha is likely to exert a significant influence on the conformation of the resulting protein. Competitive oligonucleotide primer assay for this mutation showed a homozygous wild-type pattern in genomic DNA from the 161 normal volunteers studied and from 6 phenotypically normal members of a PT-vWD family. All 7 affected members of this family studied were heterozygous for the mutant allele. Platelet GP Ib alpha mRNA reverse-transcribed and studied by competitive oligonucleotide primer assay showed similar expression of the mutant and wild-type alleles in the affected PT-vWD patients. Absence in the normal population, tight linkage with phenotypic expression of disease, and absence of any additional abnormality of GP Ib alpha in these patients identify the glycine-to-valine substitution as a point mutation underlying functional abnormality of the vWF receptor in PT-vWD.\r"

  ".W": "Cryostat sections from lymph nodes of 47 Hodgkin disease patients were examined by immunohistology for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein (LMP), nuclear antigen 2, and late viral glycoprotein gp350/250. A distinct LMP-specific membrane and cytoplasmic staining was detected exclusively in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in 18 patients (38%); EBV nuclear antigen 2 and gp350/250 immunoreactivity was absent in all instances. Thirty-two of 47 (68%) cases contained EBV-specific DNA sequences as detected by PCR, all LMP-positive cases being in this category. Our results confirm previous studies establishing the presence of EBV genomes in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells by demonstrating expression of an EBV-encoded protein in the tumor-cell population. The finding of LMP expression in the absence of EBV nuclear antigen 2 suggests a pattern of EBV gene expression different from that of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and Burkitt lymphoma, whereas this finding shows similarities with that seen in undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Because the LMP gene has transforming potential, our findings support the concept of a pathoetiological role of EBV in many cases of Hodgkin disease.\r"

  ".W": "Delivery of nonlipophilic drugs to the brain is hindered by the tightly apposed capillary endothelial cells that make up the blood-brain barrier. We have examined the ability of a monoclonal antibody (OX-26), which recognizes the rat transferrin receptor, to function as a carrier for the delivery of drugs across the blood-brain barrier. This antibody, which was previously shown to bind preferentially to capillary endothelial cells in the brain after intravenous administration (Jefferies, W. A., Brandon, M. R., Hunt, S. V., Williams, A. F., Gatter, K. C. & Mason, D. Y. (1984) Nature (London) 312, 162-163), labels the entire cerebrovascular bed in a dose-dependent manner. The initially uniform labeling of brain capillaries becomes extremely punctate approximately 4 hr after injection, suggesting a time-dependent sequestering of the antibody. Capillary-depletion experiments, in which the brain is separated into capillary and parenchymal fractions, show a time-dependent migration of radiolabeled antibody from the capillaries into the brain parenchyma, which is consistent with the transcytosis of compounds across the blood-brain barrier. Antibody-methotrexate conjugates were tested in vivo to assess the carrier ability of this antibody. Immunohistochemical staining for either component of an OX-26-methotrexate conjugate revealed patterns of cerebrovascular labeling identical to those observed with the unaltered antibody. Accumulation of radiolabeled methotrexate in the brain parenchyma is greatly enhanced when the drug is conjugated to OX-26.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expresses structural proteins and replicative enzymes within gag and gag-pol precursor polyproteins. Specific proteolytic processing of the precursors by the viral proteinase is essential for maturation of infectious viral particles. We have studied the activity of proteinase in its immature form, as part of a gag-pol fusion protein, in an in vitro expression system. We found that deletion of p6*, the region in pol upstream of proteinase, resulted in improved processing of the precursor. A modified proteinase is released, but it functions less efficiently than wild type. Improved autoprocessing correlates with increased accessibility of the active site region in the polyprotein carrying the p6* deletion. Our results suggest that p6* is involved in the regulation of proteinase activation, perhaps as a region limiting the interaction of the active site and substrate binding domain with the remainder of the polyprotein. Release of p6* inhibition may be an activation step necessary for infectious particle maturation.\r"

  ".W": "A cell-free protein-synthesizing system has been reconstituted using the S-30 fraction or ribosomes and the S-100 fraction from Plasmodium falciparum. Addition of heme in vitro stimulates cell-free protein synthesis strikingly. Chloroquine inhibits the heme-dependent protein synthesis in the parasite lysate. The drug has also been found to inhibit parasite protein synthesis in situ at therapeutic concentrations soon after addition to parasite cultures. Ribosomes as well as the S-100 fraction isolated from such chloroquine-treated cultures are defective in protein synthesis. Addition of hemin plus glucose 6-phosphate or high concentrations of GTP, cAMP, and an active preparation of eIF-2 to the parasite cell-free system restores protein synthesis to a significant extent in chloroquine-treated cultures. Under conditions of inhibition of protein synthesis in situ by chloroquine in the culture, the parasite eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha- (eIF-2 alpha) is phosphorylated in the parasite lysate to a greater extent than that observed in the control culture. Addition of hemin in vitro suppresses this phosphorylation. eIF-2 alpha kinase activity is present in the parasite lysate and is not a contaminant derived from the human erythrocytes used to culture the parasite. The heme-chloroquine interactive effects can also be demonstrated with purified eIF-2 alpha kinase from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. It is proposed that chloroquine inhibits heme-dependent protein synthesis in the parasite and this is an early event mediating the growth-inhibitory effects of the drug.\r"

  ".U": "91271279\r", 
  ".W": "Among the variety of specialized intercellular junctions, those of the adherens type have the most obvious association with cytoskeletal elements. This may be with the actin microfilament system as in the zonula adherens or with intermediate filaments as in the macula adherens, or desmosome. In the former case, it is clear that transmembrane glycoproteins of the cadherin family are important adhesive components of the molecular assembly. We now show for desmosomes that a major glycoprotein component (desmosomal glycoprotein DGI) has extensive homology with the cadherins, defining an extended family, but also has unique features in its cytoplasmic domain that are likely to be relevant to the association with intermediate rather than actin filaments. A novel 282-residue extension contains repeats of approximately 29 amino acid residues predicted to have an antiparallel beta-sheet structure, followed by a glycine-rich sequence. As in the cadherins, the extracellular domain contains possible Ca2(+)-binding sequences and a potential protease processing site. The cell adhesion recognition region (His-Ala-Val) of the cadherins is modified to Arg-Ala-Leu.\r"

  ".U": "91271280\r", 
  ".W": "Erythrocyte development in mammals depends in part upon the interaction of the glycopeptide hormone erythropoietin (EPO) with cell surface receptors on committed erythroid progenitor cells. Both this factor and an EPO receptor polypeptide previously have been cloned, yet little is presently understood concerning molecular mechanisms of receptor activation and signal transduction. To identify cytosolic receptor domains necessary for signaling, we have compared the activities of a series of deletionally mutated EPO receptor constructs by their expression in interleukin 3-dependent, myeloid FDC-P1 cells. EPO-induced growth was transduced efficiently in these cells by the full-length receptor (507 amino acids), and no measurable loss in activity resulted from the deletion of up to 111 carboxyl-terminal residues. In contrast, the deletion of 44 additional residues led to a dramatic loss (86.3% +/- 7.8%; mean +/- SD) in the ability of this receptor to mediate EPO-induced growth, thus indicating that residues between Gly-352 and Met-396 constitute a functionally critical cytosolic subdomain. Interestingly, the expression of full-length EPO receptors in FDC-P1 cells also led to a selective inhibition of normal proliferative responsiveness to the alternative hematopoietic factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Moreover, this inhibition was progressively reversed in forms of the EPO receptor in which distal cytosolic residues were sequentially deleted. These results suggest that EPO receptors normally may trans-modulate components in the pathway of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced proliferation and that this down-modulation, as exerted by intact EPO receptors, may play a role in promoting erythroid commitment during myeloid blood cell development.\r"

Sperm centrioles were also closely associated with the male pronucleus (16-20 hr after insemination) in pronuclear stage embryos. A tripolar spindle derived from a tripronuclear embryo is also demonstrated with two centrioles at one pole. The data provide evidence that human centrioles, as those in most other animals, and unlike the mouse, are paternally derived, thus supporting Boveri's classical theory. Furthermore, this study provides insights to the proposed mechanisms of aberrant cleavage patterns of dispermic human embryos.\r"

The platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene (PDGFRA) like Kit encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. By using mouse-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids and haplotype analysis in interspecific backcross mice, mouse Pdgfra was mapped to chromosome 5 in tight linkage with Kit. Hybridization of a PDGFRA probe to DNAs from W19H/ + heterozygous mice and patch heterozygous mice, and their wild-type littermates, demonstrated deletion of Pdgfra. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that Kit and Pdgfra are linked on a 630-kilobase Mlu I DNA fragment. Thus the W19H deletion removes at least two receptor tyrosine kinases and the results suggest Pdgfra as a candidate for the Ph locus.\r"
