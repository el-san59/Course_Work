This could ultimately lead to more problems with adverse drug reactions and poor clinical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Pre-steady-state kinetic measurements of 22Na+ uptake by the amiloride-sensitive Na+-H+ exchanger in renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were performed at 0 degrees C to characterize the intermediate reactions of the exchange cycle. At 1 mM Na+, the initial time course of Na+ uptake was resolved into three separate components: (i) a lag phase, (ii) an exponential or \"burst\" phase, and (iii) a constant velocity or steady-state phase. Pulse-chase experiments using partially loaded BBMV showed no evidence for 22Na+ back-flux, suggesting that the decline in the rate of Na+ uptake rate following the burst represents completion of the first turnover of the exchanger. Gramicidin completely abolished Na+ uptake, indicating that the burst phase results from the translocation of Na+ rather than from residual Na+ binding to external sites. Raising the [Na+] from 1 to 10 mM at constant pH (internal pH 5.7; external pH 7.7) produced a sigmoidal increase in the amplitude of the burst phase without affecting the lag duration or the apparent burst rate. In contrast, Na+ uptake in the steady state obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. These results suggest that a minimum of two Na+ transport sites must be occupied to activate Na+ uptake in the pre-steady state. The transition to Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the steady state can be explained by a \"flip-flop\" or alternating site mechanism in which the functional transport unit is an oligomer and only one promoter per cycle is allowed to form a translocation complex with Na+ after the first turnover.\r"

Transcripts were obtained either from templates linearized at positions located downstream from the cassette or from nonlinearized plasmids. In both cases, a spontaneous self-cleavage reaction produced BMV RNAs that contained 19 heterologous nucleotides at their 3' ends. These RNAs were biologically active, indicating that 19 extra nucleotides did not remove the infectivity. The progeny BMV RNA isolated from infected plants did not retain the 19-base heterologous sequence. BMV RNAs containing longer 3' heterologous sequences were not infectious.

  ".W": "A 32-base-pair (bp) DNA duplex with deletions in one strand, and thus extra bases in the opposing strand, was ligated head-to-tail to produce linear and circular multimers. The electrophoretic mobility of the linear multimers was analyzed in polyacrylamide gels and the size of the circular DNA was determined by electron microscopy. A 1-base deletion produced a marked retardation in the mobility of the linear multimers coincident with the formation of a population of multimeric circles of a smaller average size than the deletionless 32-mer; 2-, 3-, or 4-base deletions at the same site produced proportionately greater effects. Two 1-base deletions separated by 10 bp on the same strand produced a greater reduction in mobility than a 1-base deletion, whereas two 1-base deletions spaced by 5 bp on the same strand yielded a molecule that behaved more like the deletionless DNA. We conclude that deletions of 1-4 bases at a single site on duplex DNA produce molecules that behave as if they contain sharp bends or kinks. In contrast, single mismatches in the 32-bp duplex produced no abnormality in behavior relative to normally base-paired DNA in the gel mobility and electron microscopic assays. The possible role of such structures in organizing the three-dimensional folding of single-stranded nucleic acids is considered.\r"

  ".W": "Filaggrins are an important class of intermediate filament-associated proteins that interact with keratin intermediate filaments of terminally differentiating mammalian epidermis. They show wide species variations and their aberrant expression has been implicated in a number of keratinizing disorders. We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding human filaggrin and used this to demonstrate that the human gene encodes a polyprotein precursor containing numerous tandem filaggrin repeats. This structure is similar to that of mouse; however, the human filaggrin repeat is much longer (972 base pairs; 324 amino acids) and shows little sequence homology to the mouse protein. Also, data presented here reveal that the human filaggrin repeats show considerable sequence variations; such polymorphism is not found in the mouse. Furthermore, chromosomal mapping data revealed that the human gene is located at 1q21, indicating that the polymorphism is confined to a single locus. By peptide mapping, we define a short linker sequence within the human filaggrin repeat that is excised by proteolysis to yield functional molecules. Finally, we show by in situ hybridization that human filaggrin precursor gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level in terminally differentiating epidermis and that this represents a useful system in which to study intermediate filament-intermediate filament-associated protein interactions as well as disorders of keratinization.\r"

  ".U": "89296902\r", 
  ".W": "In addition to conveying cellular responses to an effector molecule, receptors are often themselves regulated by their effectors. We have demonstrated that epinephrine modulates both the rate of transcription of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) gene and the steady-state level of beta 2AR mRNA in DDT1MF-2 cells. Short-term (30 min) exposure to epinephrine (100 nM) stimulates the rate of beta 2AR gene transcription, resulting in a 3- to 4-fold increase in steady-state beta 2AR mRNA levels. These effects are mimicked by 1 mM N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) or foskolin but not by phorbol esters. The half-life of the beta 2AR mRNA after addition of actinomycin D (46.7 +/- 10.2 min; mean +/- SEM; n = 5) remained unchanged after 30 min of epinephrine treatment (46.8 +/- 10.6 min; mean +/- SEM; n = 4), indicating that a change in transcription rate is the predominant factor responsible for the increase of beta 2AR mRNA. Whereas brief exposure to epinephrine or Bt2cAMP does not significantly affect the total number of cellular beta 2ARs (assessed by ligand binding), continued exposure results in a gradual decline in beta 2AR number to approximately 20% (epinephrine) or approximately 45% (Bt2cAMP) of the levels in control cells by 24 hr. Similar decreases in agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity are observed. This loss of receptors with prolonged agonist exposure is accompanied by a 50% reduction in beta 2AR mRNA. Transfection of the beta 2AR promoter region cloned onto a reporter gene (bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) allowed demonstration of a 2- to 4-fold induction of transcription by agents that elevate cAMP levels, such as forskolin or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. These results establish the presence of elements within the proximal promoter region of the beta 2AR gene responsible for the transcriptional enhancing activity of cAMP and demonstrate that beta 2AR gene expression is regulated by a type of feedback mechanism involving the second messenger cAMP.\r"

Overexpression of catalytic subunit induced expression from three cAMP-regulated promoters (alpha-subunit, c-fos, E1A) in the absence of elevated levels of cAMP but did not affect expression from two unregulated promoters (Rous sarcoma virus, simian virus 40). Cotransfection of a regulatory subunit gene containing mutations in both cAMP binding sites strongly repressed both basal and induced expression from the cAMP-responsive alpha-subunit promoter without affecting expression from the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. These experiments indicate that cAMP induces gene expression through phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit and that the ambient degree of phosphorylation dictates the level of basal as well as induced expression of the cAMP-regulated alpha-subunit gene.\r"

  ".W": "Delivery of cholesterol to inner mitochondrial membranes is rate-limiting for steroidogenesis in the zona fasciculata of adrenal cortex. A protein that stimulates this process was isolated to homogeneity from bovine adrenal tissue. This protein's primary structure has been determined in its entirety by a combination of automated Edman microsequencing, fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). The sequence was identical to that previously reported for bovine brain endozepine, except that it lacks the last two residues, -Gly-Ile, at the C terminus. To our knowledge, isolation of an endozepine-related protein from a tissue other than brain has not been reported previously. Endozepine competes with benzodiazepines for saturable binding sites in synaptosomes and in mitochondria of specific peripheral tissues. Previous reports have localized the adrenal benzodiazepine receptor to the outer mitochondrial membrane. In this report, we show that the prototypic benzodiazepine, diazepam, effects a stimulation of adrenal mitochondrial cholesterol delivery similar to that observed for endozepine. The effective diazepam concentration was consistent with that previously shown to displace a high-affinity ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor. The action of diazepam in adrenal mitochondria suggests that the mediation of corticotropin-induced steroidogenesis may be the physiological function of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. These studies provide new insights into the previously unknown function of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and should allow new investigations into the stimulation of steroidogenesis by endozepines and benzodiazepines in the brain and in certain peripheral tissues.\r"

The clones were ligated, subcloned in a simian virus 40 expression vector, and used to transfect receptor-negative Vero (monkey) cells. Results showed that transfected cells expressed receptor molecules capable of binding HRV and a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the major group HRV receptor. The cloned receptor cDNA encoded a protein with a sequence nearly identical to that of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), indicating that the two surface proteins are one and the same. Both proteins have identical mass, carbohydrate composition, and tissue distribution. In addition, major group receptors on HeLa cells could be induced with various cytokines in a manner similar to the ICAM-1 ligand.

  ".U": "89296920\r", 
  ".W": "Proton transfer reactions in bacteriorhodopsin were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, using a mutant protein in which Asp-96 was replaced by Asn-96. By comparison of the BR - K, BR - L, and BR - M difference spectra (BR indicating bacteriorhodopsin ground state and K, L, and M indicating photo-intermediates) of the wild-type protein with the corresponding difference spectra of the mutant protein, detailed insight into the functional role of this residue in the proton pump mechanism is obtained. Asp-96 is protonated in BR, as well as another aspartic residue, which is tentatively assigned to be Asp-115. Asp-96 is not affected in the primary photoreaction. During formation of the L intermediate it is subjected to a change in the H-bonding character of its carboxylic group, but no deprotonation occurs at this reaction step. Also, in the mutant protein a light-induced structural change of the protein interior near the Asn-96 residue is probed. The BR - M difference spectrum of the mutant protein lacks the negative carbonyl band at 1742 cm-1 of Asp-96 and in addition a positive band at about 1378 cm-1, which is most likely to be caused by the carboxylate vibration of Asp-96. This argues for a deprotonation of Asp-96 in the time range of the M intermediate during its photostationary accumulation. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the point mutation does not induce a gross change of the protein structure, but a proton-binding site in the proton pathway from the cytoplasmic side to the Schiff base is lost.\r"

  ".U": "89296923\r", 
  ".W": "Beta-lapachone is a potent inhibitor of DNA repair in mammalian cells and activates topoisomerase I. We show that beta-lapachone can prevent the oncogenic transformation of CHEF/18A cells by ionizing radiation. Potentially lethal DNA damage repair (PLDR) occurs while x-irradiated cells are held in medium containing low serum prior to replating. PLDR processes permitted survival recovery but also drastically increased the number of foci per plate (i.e., transformation) of CHEF/18A cells. By blocking PLDR with beta-lapachone, both survival recovery and enhanced transformation were prevented. At equivalent survival levels, exposure of x-irradiated cells to beta-lapachone resulted in an 8-fold decrease in the number of foci per dish as compared to the number of transformants produced after PLDR. Early PLDR-derived increases in transformation may be the result of error-prone genetic rearrangements dependent on topoisomerase I, which are thereby prevented by beta-lapachone. Beta-lapachone exposure decreased the rejoining of DNA strand breaks and produced additional double-strand breaks in x-irradiated cells during PLDR. The activation of topoisomerase I by beta-lapachone may convert repairable single-strand DNA breaks into the more repair-resistant double-strand breaks, thereby preventing PLDR and neoplastic transformation. These results suggest a new direction for the development of anticarcinogenic agents.\r"

When shifted to mitogen-depleted medium, proliferating myoblasts irreversibly withdraw from the cell cycle and commit to terminal differentiation. Early after commitment, postreplicative myocytes maintain nearly proliferative levels of TK mRNA but have greatly reduced levels of TK activity. Metabolic labeling studies with [35S]methionine indicated that the decrease in TK activity was associated with a 10-fold reduction in the rate of TK protein synthesis. Commitment had little effect on the stability or catalytic efficiency of TK protein. The decrease in TK synthetic rate in the continued presence of TK mRNA indicated that translation of TK mRNA was repressed in committed cells. The distribution of TK mRNA between ribonucleoprotein particles and polysomes was determined. In both proliferative cells and committed cells, TK mRNA levels were maximal in polysomes containing five to seven ribosomes. Thus, the synthesis of TK protein in nonreplicating muscle cells was inhibited by a translational mechanism that did not alter the average number of ribosomes engaged by TK mRNA.\r"

Fundamental morphological changes that led to modern mammals are often represented by small samples of isolated teeth. Fortunately, functional wear facets on teeth allow prediction of the morphology of occluding teeth that may be unrepresented by fossils. A major step in mammalian evolution occurred in the Early Cretaceous with the evolution of tribosphenic molars, which characterize marsupials and placentals, the two most abundant and diverse extant groups of mammals. A tooth from the Early Cretaceous (110 million years before present) of Texas tests previous predictions (based on lower molars) of the morphology of upper molars in early tribosphenic dentitions. The lingual cusp (protocone) is primitively without shear facets, as expected, but the cheek side of the tooth is derived (advanced) in having distinctive cusps along the margin. The tooth, although distressingly inadequate to define many features of the organism, demonstrates unexpected morphological diversity at a strategic stage of mammalian evolution and falsifies previous claims of the earliest occurrence of true marsupials.\r"

The predicted primary structure of the protein sequence is 139 amino acids in length and lacks an N-terminal signal sequence. Unexpectedly, the O. luteus rbcS amino acid sequence shows the greatest similarity (56% identity) to that of the chemolithotrophic bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus. A comparison of the N-terminal amino acid rbcS sequence of A. eutrophus to those of O. luteus and brown alga Fucus species shows extensive sequence similarity (68.3% identity).

Building on further evidence for this process, Cairns et al. [Cairns, J., Overbaugh, J. & Miller, S. (1988) Nature (London) 335, 142-145] have suggested a Lamarckian mechanism of directed mutation. This paper proposes an alternative mechanism: transcription induced by the substrate introduces a bias in the random process of mutation, because the resulting single-stranded regions of DNA are more mutable. This stimulation of adaptive mutations by the environment has implications for evolution similar to those of directed mutation, but without contradicting the central \"dogma\" of molecular genetics. In addition, in eukaryotic cells a mutagenic effect of induction on protooncogenes could contribute to the stimulatory effect of proliferation on carcinogenesis.\r"

We have karyotyped several primary tumors as well as a series of low-passage cell lines derived both from fibromatoses and from fibrosarcomas. The fibrosarcomas, but not the preneoplastic fibromatoses, show consistent abnormalities of one or both of two chromosomes, chromosome 8 (trisomy or duplication) and chromosome 14 (monosomy or translocation). The chromosomal abnormalities are not a direct consequence of the viral integration, which we have mapped to chromosome 15 by in situ hybridization. These results suggest that transgenic mice can be used to study the role(s) of cytogenetic changes in tumorigenesis and may direct the search for genes involved in tumor progression.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid and powerful approach for linking individual clones of a cosmid library and the assembly of a large physical map is presented, which depends on the simultaneous analysis of many cosmid clones for overlapping regions. This method uses cosmid vectors that contain endogenous bacteriophage T3 and T7 promoters to allow for the identification of overlapping clones through the synthesis of end-specific RNA probes. A genomic library is constructed and organized as an ordered matrix such that each clone is assigned an identifying coordinate. DNA from mixtures of cosmid clones is pooled such that each pool contains only one common member with any other pool, RNA probes are prepared from mixtures of cosmid clones, and groups of clones overlapping with the constituents of the mixtures are determined by hybridization. Pooled probes are most simply prepared by grouping clones according to the rows and columns of the library matrix. The pairwise comparison of data generated by the hybridization of mixed probes can be decoded by using simple algorithms that predict the order and linkage of all clones in the collection and organize them into predicted contigs. To demonstrate the feasibility of multiplexed analysis of cosmids, a genomic library was prepared from a mouse-human somatic cell hybrid that contains a portion of the long arm of human chromosome 11. Preparation, arrangement on a matrix, and analysis of pooled cosmid clones from this collection resulted in the detection of 1099 linked pairs of cosmids, which could be assembled into 315 contigs. Thus, with a minimal amount of effort, a substantial portion of this genomic region has been linked in multiple overlapping contigs. This method may have practical applications in the large-scale mapping and sequencing of mammalian genomes.\r"

The affected gene product has not been identified in these animals. To study the normal function of iv, we have taken an approach directed to the gene itself. As a first step, we have mapped iv genetically, by examining its segregation in backcrosses with respect to markers defined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The iv locus lies 3 centimorgans (cM) from the immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant-region gene complex (Igh-C) on chromosome 12. A multilocus map of the region suggests the gene order centromere-Aat (alpha 1-antitrypsin gene complex)-(11 cM)-iv-(3 cM)-Igh-C-(1 cM)-Igh-V (immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene complex).\r"

The involvement of delta diversity segments at the translocation junctions suggests that the translocation occurred during an attempt at D delta 1-D delta 2 joining in a stem cell. The segment of chromosome 1 at band p32, adjacent to the chromosomal breakpoint, encodes a transcriptional unit designated TCL5 (T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 5). The differential expression of the TCL5 RNA transcripts in this lymphohemopoietic stem cell line relative to several other T- and B-cell lines suggests that TCL5 gene expression is an integral event in the pathogenesis of the T-cell leukemia. Rearrangement of the TCL5 locus in a human melanoma cell line carrying a del(1p32) further implies that the TCL5 gene may play a role in malignant transformation.\r"

In the protein coding region of the murine cDNA, the nucleotide sequence and the corresponding deduced amino acid sequences were 82% and 86% identical to the respective human sequences. All five amino acids presently known to be essential for normal enzymatic activity were conserved between mouse and man. The murine enzyme had a single deletion relative to the human enzyme at amino acid number 273. One ATG translation initiation signal was present in the mouse sequence in contrast to the human sequence, where two start codons have been reported. Nucleotide sequencing of a clone derived from murine genomic DNA revealed that the murine signal for translation initiation was located in exon 2. The locations of all 10 introns were conserved among mouse and man. We mapped the genetic locus for glucocerebrosidase to mouse chromosome 3, at a position 7.6 +/- 3.2 centimorgans from the locus for the beta subunit of nerve growth factor.

Clones in the second group encode a protein with an extra 21 amino acids that could comprise a cytoplasmic domain. Direct peptide sequencing was used to determine the N terminus of the mature CD16 receptor protein and supported the existence of the two forms of the receptor. Treatment of neutrophils with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C resulted in the release of a large percentage of the CD16 molecules from the cell surface. In contrast, treatment of natural killer cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C did not release any CD16 from the cell surface.

That they may participate in embryonic cell-cell interactions and/or play a role in immune responses against tumors has been speculated. We have studied two murine embryonal carcinoma tumors, 402AX and PCC4, that are rejected in vivo immunologically, although they do not express H-2K or H-2D antigens. Transplantation studies with these cells suggest that rejection is mediated by class-I-like major histocompatibility complex antigens. As a first step in evaluating Qa/Tla function(s), we have characterized expression of class I-like genes and proteins in 402AX and PCC4 cells. Northern (RNA) blot hybridizations, polymerase chain reaction studies, and cDNA cloning experiments demonstrate that EC lines transcribe genes allelic to the Tla region gene \"37\", Qa-2 region gene \"Q7\", and another, previously uncharacterized, class I-like gene. Immunoprecipitation studies show that the embryonal carcinoma tumor cells contain low levels of beta 2-microglobulin expressed in association with non-H-2K, non-H-2D class I-like proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of protooncogenes and inactivation of putative tumor suppressor genes are genetic lesions considered to be important in lung carcinogenesis. Fifty-four cases of non-small-cell lung cancer (23 adenocarcinomas, 23 squamous-cell carcinomas, and 8 large-cell carcinomas) were examined for loss of DNA sequences at 13 polymorphic genetic loci. Loss of heterozygosity was seen more frequently in squamous-cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma. The loss of DNA sequences from the short arm of chromosome 17 (D17S1 locus) was detected in 8 of 9 heterozygous cases of squamous-cell carcinoma and in only 2 of 11 heterozygous cases of adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, in 7 of these 8 squamous-cell carcinomas, loss of heterozygosity from chromosome 17 was accompanied by loss of DNA sequences from chromosome 11. The spectrum of allelic sequences lost from chromosome 11 was, however, similar in every type of carcinoma studied, and the data show two regions commonly deleted from chromosome 11 (11pter-p15.5 and 11p13-q13) that may have a role in the pathogenesis of all these types of non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma. Loss of DNA sequences from chromosome 3 was seen in 16 of 31 cases where the constitutive DNA was heterozygous-i.e., informative. These data included only 6 of 16 cases where loss of heterozygosity involved a chromosomal locus previously shown to be lost consistently in small-cell lung cancer (DNF15S2). Loss of heterozygosity at the chromosome 13q locus, D13S3, was seen in 9 of 21 informative cases, and in 2 cases, both adenocarcinomas, duplication of the intact DNA sequences suggested the possibility that mitotic recombination had occurred. Frequent DNA sequence deletions, including those from chromosome 17, in squamous-cell carcinomas may reflect the extensive mutagenic and clastogenic effects of tobacco smoke that may lead to inactivation of putative tumor-suppressor genes.\r"

Sequence analysis and comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences for both clones disclosed 12% evolutionary divergence in structure. Hybridization of both cDNA probes to genomic DNA from four pathogenic and five nonpathogenic E. histolytica isolates revealed two distinct Southern blot patterns, one characteristic for pathogenic amoebae and the other for nonpathogenic amoebae. Further, the complex pattern of restriction fragments hybridizing to an actin cDNA probe was also different between pathogenic and nonpathogenic isolates but was conserved within each group of amoebae.

  ".W": "We have shown previously that reserpine is an effective \"modulator\" of P-glycoprotein-associated multidrug resistance (MDR). In addition to enhancing drug cytotoxicity in our multidrug-resistant human leukemia cell line, CEM/VLB100, reserpine strongly competes with a photoactivatible analog of vinblastine, N-(p-azido-3-[125I]iodosalicyl)-N'-(beta-aminoethyl)vindesine, for binding to P-glycoprotein. We also demonstrated previously that there are three substructural domains present in many compounds that modulate P-glycoprotein-associated MDR: a basic nitrogen atom and two planar aromatic rings. In the present study, we wished to test more rigorously the hypothesis that not only are these domains necessary for modulators of MDR but also they must exist in an appropriate conformation. Reserpine is a modulator of MDR in which these domains are present in a well-defined conformation. Accordingly, we prepared eight compounds that vary the spatial orientation of these domains, using either naturally occurring reserpine or yohimbine as chemical templates. When tested for their ability to enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural product antitumor drugs in CEM/VLB100 cells, five compounds that retained the pendant benzoyl function in an appropriate spatial orientation all modulated MDR. By contrast, compounds lacking this moiety failed to do so. These active modulators competed strongly with the 125I-labeled vinblastine analog for binding to P-glycoprotein in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from these cells. Conformational analysis using molecular mechanics revealed the structural similarities of the active modulators. Our results support the hypothesis that the relative disposition of aromatic rings and basic nitrogen atom is important for modulators of P-glycoprotein-associated MDR, and they suggest a ligand-receptor relationship for these agents. These results also provide direction for the definition of an MDR \"pharmacophore.\"\r"

  ".W": "The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), composed of characteristic facial abnormalities and a severe neuronal migration disorder affecting the cerebral cortex, is caused by visible or submicroscopic deletions of chromosome band 17p13. Twelve anonymous DNA markers were tested against a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing 17p deletions from seven MDS patients. All patients, including three with normal karyotypes, are deleted for a variable set of 5-12 markers. Two highly polymorphic VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) probes, YNZ22 and YNH37, are codeleted in all patients tested and make molecular diagnosis for this disorder feasible. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, YNZ22 and YNH37 were shown to be within 30 kilobases (kb) of each other. Cosmid clones containing both VNTR sequences were identified, and restriction mapping showed them to be less than 15 kb apart. Three overlapping cosmids spanning greater than 100 kb were completely deleted in all patients, providing a minimum estimate of the size of the MDS critical region. A hypomethylated island and evolutionarily conserved sequences were identified within this 100-kb region, indications of the presence of one or more expressed sequences potentially involved in the pathophysiology of this disorder. The conserved sequences were mapped to mouse chromosome 11 by using mouse-rat somatic cell hybrids, extending the remarkable homology between human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11 by 30 centimorgans, into the 17p telomere region.\r"

  ".U": "89296960\r", 
  ".W": "Hyperglycemia is believed to be the major cause of diabetic vascular complications involving both microvessels and arteries as in the retina, renal glomeruli, and aorta. It is unclear by which mechanism hyperglycemia is altering the metabolism and functions of vascular cells, although changes in nonenzymatic protein glycosylation and increases in cellular sorbitol levels have been postulated to be involved. Previously, we have reported that the elevation of extracellular glucose levels with cultured bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells causes an increase in protein kinase C (PKC) activity of the membranous pool with a parallel decrease in the cytosol without alteration of its total activity. Now we demonstrate that the mechanism for the activation of PKC is due to an enhanced de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol as indicated by a 2-fold increase of [14C]diacylglycerol labeling from [14C]glucose. The elevated diacylglycerol de novo synthesis is secondarily due to increased formation of precursors derived from glucose metabolism; this formation is enhanced by hyperglycemia as substantiated by elevated [3H]glucose conversion into water. This effect of hyperglycemia on PKC is also observed in cultured aortic smooth muscle and endothelial cells and the retina and kidney of diabetic rats, but not in the brain. Since PKC in vascular cells has been shown to modulate hormone receptor turnover, neovascularization in vitro, and cell growth, we propose that this mechanism of enhancing the membranous PKC activities by hyperglycemia plays an important role in the development of diabetic vascular complications.\r"

At 25-50 microM free ligand concentration, each drug produced a specific and reproducible pattern of extractable proteins of different molecular weight by (i) releasing new proteins, (ii) altering the quantity of particular extracted proteins, and/or (iii) selectively entrapping other proteins in the nuclei. Ethidium, up to 100 microM, did not affect release of proteins from the nuclei. These results indicate that each ligand either has different binding site(s) in chromatin or modulates chromatin structure in a specific way by changing the affinity of different sets of proteins for their respective binding sites, resulting in their selective extraction or entrapment. The lack of effect of ethidium indicates that intercalation of the ligand to DNA, per se, does not alter the release of nuclear proteins. If patterns of nuclear proteins selectively released or retained by antitumor drugs are found to correlate with biological activity, this type of analysis may be helpful in new drug design and screening.\r"

The synthesis of NO and citrulline is dependent on the presence of physiological concentrations of free Ca2+ and is inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, but not by its enantiomer NG-monomethyl-D-arginine or by L-canavanine. L-Homoarginine, L-arginyl-L-aspartate, or L-arginine methyl ester can replace L-arginine as substrates for the enzyme. These results indicate that NO is formed from L-arginine in the brain through an enzymic reaction similar to that in vascular endothelial cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, adding support to our hypothesis that the formation of NO from L-arginine is a widespread transduction mechanism for the stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) X gene during virus infection has not been defined. We previously showed that expression of the HBV X gene in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 trans-activates chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression under control of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat and we have now identified a specific sequence in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat that is responsive to the HBV X gene. Plasmid constructs with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene regulated by an isolated and twice-repeated 12-base-pair HIV-1 enhancer sequence homologous to the nucleotide sequence that binds the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B (the HIV-1 kappa B-like sequence) were trans-activated by the HBV X gene in HepG2 cells, indicating that the kappa B-like enhancer sequence in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat is responsive to the X gene. When eight copies of the HIV-1 kappa B-like sequence were used to regulate beta-globin gene expression, transcription of this gene was activated by the HBV X gene in HepG2 cells and no beta-globin gene transcription was detected in the absence of the HBV X gene. beta-globin gene expression regulated by the activator protein 2 (AP-2) binding sequence was not activated by the HBV X gene. Treatment of HepG2 cells with phorbol ester resulted in modest activation of the HIV-1 kappa B-like enhancer sequence suggesting that an NF-kappa B-like factor was induced in these cells as it is in T lymphocytes by phorbol ester; however, phorbol ester did not demonstrably enhance the activation of the HIV-1 enhancer observed with the HBV X gene. These experiments indicate that the HIV-1 kappa B-like transcriptional enhancer sequence is activated by the HBV X gene and suggest that the HBV X gene might play a role in regulating transcription of a gene under control of a kappa B-like enhancer during HBV infection. Since such a sequence has not been found in the HBV genome and HBV gene expression appears not to be regulated by the HBV X gene, a cellular gene that plays a role in HBV replication could be the target of the X gene during HBV infection.\r"

Determination of the primary structure of this protein should be of importance for understanding the functional role it plays in astroglia. Therefore, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding this protein and determined its nucleotide sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that GFAP shares structural similarities--particularly in the central rod domain and to a lesser degree in the carboxyl-terminal domain--with other IF proteins found in nonepithelial cell types. Considerable sequence divergence in the amino-terminal region of GFAP suggests that the tissue-specific functions of this IF protein might be mediated through this region of the molecule. In contrast, conservation of structural characteristics and a moderate degree of sequence conservation in the carboxyl-terminal region suggest functional similarities. Blot hybridization analysis using the GFAP cDNA as a probe failed to detect GFAP mRNA in both normal and neoplastic human tissues in which IF proteins other than GFAP are known to be expressed.\r"

Two deltorphins with the sequence Tyr-Ala-Phe-Asp(or Glu)-Val-Val-Gly-NH2 have been isolated from skin extracts of Phyllomedusa bicolor. The alanine in position 2 is in the D configuration. These peptides, [D-Ala2]deltorphins I and II, show an even higher affinity for delta receptors than the previously characterized deltorphin, which contains D-methionine as the second amino acid. These peptides show some similarity to another constituent of Phyllomedusa skin, dermorphin, which is highly selective for mu-opioid receptors. These peptides all have the N-terminal sequence Tyr-D-Xaa-Phe, where D-Xaa is either D-alanine or D-methionine. While this structure seems to be capable of activating both mu and delta opioid receptors, differences in the C-terminal regions of these peptides are probably responsible for the observed high receptor selectivity of dermorphin and deltorphin.\r"

However, a specific role or mechanism of action for CCK in this context has not been established. CCK coexists with oxytocin in magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system, sharing common neurosecretory vesicles with oxytocin in the neural lobe of the pituitary. The neural lobe, which consists primarily of oxytocin- and vasopressin-containing axons and nerve terminals and their surrounding glia, provides a relatively simple model system allowing for the study of the regulation of neurosecretion at the nerve terminal level, free from the complex array of synaptic effects present throughout the rest of the central nervous system. In this paper, we demonstrate the presence of high-affinity CCK binding sites in the rat neural lobe and show that activation of these receptors by the sulfated octapeptide, CCK-8, and related peptides causes potent secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin from the isolated nerve terminals. The secretagogue action of CCK-8, which is blocked by a CCK receptor antagonist (L-364,718), is independent of electrical stimulation and extracellular calcium and is blocked by an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Thus, the action of CCK on the neural lobe provides an example of peptide ligand-induced neurosecretion apparently mediated by second messengers rather than depolarization-induced calcium influx.\r"

  ".W": "We have used in situ hybridization to determine the regional distribution of mRNA encoding the neurotensin/neuromedin N (NT/N) precursor in the forebrain of the adult male rat. Cells containing NT/N mRNA are widely distributed in the forebrain. These areas include the septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area, hypothalamus, amygdala, accumbens nucleus, caudate-putamen, and piriform and retrosplenial cortex. In general, the regional distribution of NT/N mRNA corresponds to the previously determined distribution of neurotensin-immunoreactive cell bodies; however, several notable exceptions were observed. The most striking difference occurs specifically in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where intense labeling is associated with the pyramidal cell layer despite the reported absence of neurotensin-immunoreactive cells in this region. Analysis of microdissected tissue by S1 nuclease protection assay confirmed the abundance of authentic NT/N mRNA in CA1. A second major discrepancy between NT/N mRNA abundance and neurotensin-immunoreactivity occurs in the intensely labeled subiculum, a region that contains only scattered neurotensin-immunoreactive cells in the adult. These results suggest that, in specific regions of the forebrain, NT/N precursor is processed to yield products other than neurotensin. In addition, these results provide an anatomical basis for studying the physiological regulation of NT/N mRNA levels in the forebrain.\r"

  ".U": "89296974\r", 
  ".W": "Voltage-gated Ca channels are very efficient pores: even while exhibiting strong ionic selectivity, they are highly permeant to divalent cations. Studies of the mechanism of selectivity and ion permeation have demonstrated that whole-cell Ca channel current in mixtures of Ca and Ba ions can be smaller than with equimolar concentrations of either ion alone. This anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) has provided an important impetus for proposed mechanisms of ion selectivity and permeation that invoke multiple ion binding sites. However, recordings of unitary L-type Ca currents did not demonstrate the AMFE [Marban, E. & Yue, D.T. (1988) Biophys. J. 55, 594a (abstr.)], raising doubts about whether it is an expression of ion permeation through open Ca channels. We have made patch-clamp recordings from single L-type Ca channels in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. Our results demonstrate a significant AMFE at the single-channel level but also indicate that the AMFE can only be found under restrictive conditions of permeant ion concentration and membrane potential. While the AMFE is clear at 0 mV when permeant ions are present at 10 mM, it is not evident when the divalent cation concentration is increased to 110 mM or the membrane potential is hyperpolarized to -40 mV. We compared our experimental observations with predictions of a single-file, two-binding-site model of the Ca channel. The model accounts for our experimental results. It predicts an AMFE under conditions that favor ion-ion interactions, as long as the outer binding site is not saturated due to high permeant ion concentration or negative membrane potential.\r"

  ".W": "Basolateral membrane vesicles from Necturus enterocytes, highly (greater than 20-fold) enriched in Na+,K+-ATPase, were reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. The principal channel activity observed is selective for K+ over Na+ and Cl-. This K+ channel is blocked by Ba2+ and Leiurus quinquestriatus venom but is not affected by Ca2+ over the range of 10(-3) to less than 10(-7) M and is not inhibited by charybdotoxin. L. quinquestriatus venom also markedly reduces the conductance of the basolateral membrane of intact villus cells of Necturus small intestine. The open-time probability (Po) of the channel displays a voltage-dependence characteristic of an \"inward rectifier\"; i.e., the channel inactivates when the basolateral membrane is depolarized and Po increases with increasing hyperpolarization of that barrier. Assuming that similar properties prevail under physiological conditions, this characteristic could provide, in part, an explanation for the parallelism between Na+-pump and K+-leak activities of the basolateral membrane observed in this epithelium. Thus, an increase in rheogenic Na+-pump activity at the basolateral membrane would hyperpolarize that barrier and, in turn, increase the open time of this K+ channel.\r"

  ".W": "We have presented a model that can be used to organize current concepts of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and motor control theory into a clinically relevant context. This model can be used to postulate the causal relationship among pathology, impairments, and disabilities. Knowledge of the insult often provides predictive information regarding stability of the disability, progression of the disease, and possibly recovery. Knowledge of neuropathology should guide the clinician regarding the types of impairments that are expected. Thus, by knowing the type and location of the lesion, the clinician already has a perspective regarding which evaluative tests should be emphasized and what treatment strategies will be most effective. In the absence of known pathology, knowledge of motor control theory, neuroanatomy, and neuropathology can still help the clinician make educated judgments regarding the interrelationship of the patient's impairments. In this model, we separate impairments that result directly from neuropathology and those that arise indirectly to help the clinician keep the total patient in perspective and to focus intervention. This separation emphasizes the applicability and limitations of motor control theories in the treatment of neurologically impaired individuals. Motor control theory helps to identify the relationship between direct impairments and their likely consequences; motor control theory does not address the very real issue of impairments that arise indirectly in systems such as the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems. Impairments that occur as a composite effect of multiple causes are identified as a separate category. Some of the causes of these impairments can often be addressed by physical therapy intervention, and some cannot.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The end of the wire was either snared by a retrieval basket or guided through a sheath in the ipsilateral common femoral artery, thus providing a firmly anchored pathway for subsequent manipulations. Balloons were then inserted retrograde through both common femoral arteries and dilated. In the first five patients, ipsilateral retrograde passage of a guide wire had failed despite multiple attempts with a variety of devices. In the other five patients, the contralateral antegrade approach was used initially. The new method was successful in all 10 patients with totally obstructed common iliac arteries.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of imaging procedures were performed in 28 patients with ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome in an attempt to localize the ACTH-producing tumor. Diagnosis was made on the basis of removal of an ACTH-producing tumor or biopsy of metastases in the 19 patients with a proved source and the absence of ACTH gradients in bilateral samples of the inferior petrosal sinuses in the nine patients in whom an ACTH-secreting tumor had not been localized. Eleven bronchial carcinoids, two thymic carcinoids, three pheochromocytomas, and three islet-cell tumors constituted the proved sources. The condition has been cured in eight patients, six are alive with residual tumor, and five have died. Of the nine patients with undetected sites of ACTH production, one has died of pneumocystis pneumonia and eight are being treated medically or with bilateral adrenalectomy. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen was the most helpful study in the detection of these tumors. Selective arteriography (bronchial and visceral), systemic and portal venous sampling, and iodine-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy failed to demonstrate tumors when findings at CT were negative. Bronchial carcinoids constituted most of the ACTH-secreting tumors in this study (58%) and in a review of four large series (47%). To assure early detection of these potentially malignant tumors, pulmonary CT should be performed every 6 months, even after hypercortisolism has been medically or surgically controlled.\r"

In 42 patients, cortical readings did not exceed 50 HU and corticomedullary attenuation differences (CMADs) did not exceed 10 HU. In seven patients (intermediate group), there was persistent cortical enhancement (mean attenuation, 58.3-84.8 HU; CMAD, 10.3-40.3 HU), but there was no significant rise in levels of blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine. A single patient had contrast nephropathy and exhibited a mean cortical attenuation of 141.6 HU and a mean CMAD of 85.8 HU on the 24-hour CT scan. The authors have seen two additional cases of contrast nephropathy presaged by mean cortical attenuations of 162 and 209 HU on the 24-hour CT scan. One of these patients had been in the intermediate group in the prospective study. A cortical attenuation of 55-110 HU on a 24-hour postcontrast scan may help identify a group of patients with subclinical renal impairment who are at high risk of nephropathy on subsequent exposure to contrast medium, while cortical attenuations in excess of 140 HU seem to be an early indicator of contrast nephropathy.\r"

Direct correlation between the findings in 7-micron-thick macrosections and their corresponding MR images was possible. Fourteen patients had macroscopic evidence of cancer. In all 14 cases, the carcinoma nodules appeared as areas of low signal intensity on images obtained with a repetition time of 2,500 msec and an echo time of 80 msec. Ten of 14 nodules had well-defined margins and consisted of densely packed glandular elements, which displaced the surrounding normal glandular material of higher signal intensity. Ten specimens displayed benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The MR characteristics of this entity were quite variable but relatively predictable, depending on the distribution and size of the glandular elements, as well as the composition of the surrounding stroma. In BPH, the changes began in the central portion of the gland. The areas of highest signal intensity corresponded to dilated glandular elements (cystic ectasia), while the areas of lowest signal intensity corresponded to collagen (scar) and fibromuscular stroma. Nodules of mixed glandular BPH and fibromuscular BPH were found to have signal intensities similar to those of well-differentiated nodules of prostatic adenocarcinoma.\r"

Morphologic findings at MR imaging were similar for both conditions. The lesions were, however, heterogeneous in six of the nine patients with malignant RPF and homogeneous in all eight patients with nonmalignant RPF. On T2-predominant images, malignant RPF showed high signal intensity, while nonmalignant RPF showed low signal intensity. On T2-predominant images, signal intensity and T2 were significantly higher in malignant RPF than in nonmalignant RPF. Differentiation between malignant and nonmalignant RPF appears feasible and depends on tissue contrast rather than on morphologic characteristics.\r"

Overall, compared with precontrast T1- and T2-weighted images, Gd-DTPA improved the visibility of lesions in 11 and five of 27 patients, respectively. Gd-DTPA particularly improved the conspicuity of tumors of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses and tumors having perineural or intracranial extension. Gd-DTPA-enhanced images were equivalent to precontrast T1- and T2-weighted images in five and 13 patients, respectively, and inferior to them in nine and eight patients, respectively. Mixed results were obtained in two patients and one patient when Gd-DTPA-enhanced images were compared with T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively.

When possible, patients with acute stroke were examined with MR imaging prospectively at the onset of symptoms and then at weekly intervals for several months. Focal infarction without distal axonal degeneration is demonstrated for the 1st month following onset of clinical symptoms. At 4 weeks, a well-defined band of hypointense signal appears on T2-weighted images in the topographic distribution of the corticospinal tract. After 10-14 weeks, the signal becomes permanently hyperintense. Over several years, accompanying ipsilateral brain stem shrinkage occurs. The dark signal intensity observed on T2-weighted images between 4 and 14 weeks is believed to result primarily from transitory increased lipid-protein ratio.\r"

Lesion depiction and characterization were superior (P less than .01) at 1.5 T with T2-weighted SE sequences. Improved depiction and characterization of lesions 300 or more days old (P less than .01) accounted for this result. With the GR sequence, depiction and characterization were similar at both field strengths. The GR sequence did not provide significant additional information about hemorrhage at 1.5 T in this series, but it improved depiction and characterization of hemorrhage at 0.5 T.\r"

  ".W": "With use of a modified surface coil technique, the authors recorded phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectra of the brains of 40 neonates and infants (48 examinations) ranging from 33 weeks postconceptional age to 6 years of age. Signals of phosphorus metabolites were collected in the frontotemporal region of the brain, and various P-31 MR spectral variables were compared at different times during postnatal life. The ratio of the phosphomonoester signal to the phosphodiester signal, which is related to phospholipid synthesis, decreases within the first 6 months of life; during the same time period, the ratio of the phosphocreatine (PCr) signal to the beta-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) signal increases. In addition, a difference was observed between the areas under the alpha- and beta-ATP peaks. This difference increases with age and correlates with the PCr/beta-ATP signal ratio. The variation of the alpha-ATP peak with age might be explained by overlap of the signals of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and alpha-ATP.\r"

In 22 of the 25 fractures caused by malignancy, MR images showed complete replacement of normal bone marrow, whereas 47 of the 61 benign fractures without history of trauma had complete preservation of normal bone marrow. The remaining 14 benign fractures had incompletely preserved bone marrow in a regular pattern. In two of the three remaining malignant fractures, the bone marrow replacement also was incomplete but with an irregular pattern. In cases of recent trauma or primary bone marrow abnormalities, the configuration and signal of remaining bone marrow were not useful in differentiating among malignancy, osteoporosis, and other benign processes. When criteria based on complete loss or preservation of marrow and marrow configuration in cases of incomplete loss were used, the accuracy in differentiating benign from malignant fractures was 94%. MR imaging may be a useful adjunct in differentiating benign from metastatic fractures and may provide information not available with other imaging methods.\r"

The MR imaging and arthrographic studies were reviewed without knowledge of surgical results or of the other studies. A scoring system was developed and a score assigned to each patient's MR study. The sensitivity of MR imaging for all tears (partial and full thickness) was 0.91, and the specificity was 0.88; whereas the sensitivity and specificity of arthrography were each 0.71. The scoring system improved the sensitivity to 1.0 and the specificity to 0.92. Linear regression analysis showed excellent correlation between preoperative assessment of the size of rotator cuff tears and measurement at surgery (r = .95).\r"

Seventy-two percent of the lesions appeared as microcalcifications, 10% as soft-tissue abnormalities, and 12% as a combination of the two. Six percent of lesions were found incidentally in the biopsy specimen. On the basis of mammographic measurements, 22% of the lesions were 5 mm or smaller, and 75% were 20 mm or smaller. Thirty-five percent of the microcalcification clusters were categorized as predominantly casts (linear), 52% as granular, and 13% as granular with several casts. Related pathologic features included the location of the tumor within the ductal system, pattern of growth (histologic subtype), amount and distribution of calcium formation, and presence or absence of reactive changes. Women aged 49 years or less with DCIS were more likely to have microcalcifications and less likely to have a soft-tissue mass than women aged 50 years or more (P = .04). The authors conclude that there is a wide spectrum of mammographic appearances of clinically occult DCIS.\r"

Interviews were conducted by professional interviewers using a brief, structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed with chi 2 Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum statistics and discriminant analysis. Noncompliant subjects reported more barriers than compliant subjects. The former were more likely to believe that mammography is unnecessary in the absence of symptoms and that it is inconvenient. In both the bivariate and multivariate analyses, the woman's belief that her doctor believes in regular mammography was an important predictor of compliance.\r"

Of 20 patients with gallbladder cancer, 14 (70%) had proved adenopathy and nine (45%) had peritoneal spread at presentation, and another three later developed carcinomatosis. Of 22 patients with proximal cholangiocarcinoma, 16 (73%) had nodal involvement at presentation, four later developed adenopathy, and five had peritoneal dissemination. Distal or diffuse cholangiocarcinomas were less associated with metastatic nodes or peritoneal spread. For all biliary cancers, the nodes most commonly involved were the node of the foramen of Winslow, the superior pancreatoduodenal node, and the posterior pancreatoduodenal chain. Extrahepatic tumor spread produced proximal intestinal obstruction in 13 patients (23%). CT reliably demonstrates lymphatic or other extrahepatic spread of biliary cancers, which may have an important bearing on management decisions.\r"

Myocardial viability was assessed in each animal by means of postmortem triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Tissue was characterized from the in vivo P-31 MR data by means of logistic regression analysis. The accuracy of using the P-31 MR data for distinguishing reperfused-viable from reperfused-infarcted myocardium was 100% (69 of 69 data points, 18 of 18 animals). Results of the logistic regression procedure indicated that phosphocreatine was the metabolic variable enabling most effective separation of reperfused-viable and reperfused-infarcted myocardium.

Variables that favorably influenced clot lysis and the reestablishment of antegrade blood flow through the graft were a short duration of occlusion and a suprainguinal graft position. The median duration of patency after infusion and adjunctive therapy was 162 days, with 75% limb salvage at 301 days. No statistically significant variables that influenced the length of patency were identified. These long-term patency results are inferior to the reported results in suprainguinal grafts after reoperation.

In the present series, infrapopliteal and below-knee popliteal sole laser thermal angioplasty was successfully performed on 14 of 16 (88%) lesions in 10 patients. Initial clinical and hemodynamic improvement was observed in seven of 10 (70%) patients, with clinical failure noted in three nonsurgical candidates with poor distal vessel runoff. Short-term clinical follow-up (mean, 6 months) revealed 100% patency at the site of laser thermal angioplasty. Clinical success was maintained in five of seven (71%) patients; symptoms recurred in two patients who had undergone laser thermal angioplasty and adjuvant balloon angioplasty of superficial femoral artery lesions. Treatment of distal peripheral arterial lesions with laser thermal angioplasty alone is feasible; studies comparing it with conventional balloon angioplasty should be considered.\r"

Bilateral iliac recanalizations in the fourth patient were locally successful but did not prevent the patient's death from advanced ischemic disease. Eight patients were treated percutaneously. Initial recanalization was successful in seven. Four had early reocclusions and required amputation below the knee. One suffered distal embolization after recanalization of a 6-cm popliteal segment and underwent above-the-knee amputation. Long-term follow-up (7-18 months) in the other three patients with successful primary recanalizations has confirmed patency of the recanalized segments.\r"

Each of the two large hydrophilic domains contains a sequence that is homologous to a single cytoplasmic domain of several guanylyl cyclases; these sequences may represent nucleotide binding sites. An unexpected topographical resemblance between adenylyl cyclase and various plasma membrane channels and transporters was observed. This structural complexity suggests possible, unappreciated functions for this important enzyme.\r"

In rats, this role is reflected in the spatially selective discharge of hippocampal pyramidal cells. The principal metric for coding spatial relationships might be the organism's own movements in space, that is, the spatial relationship between two locations is coded in terms of the movements executed in getting from one to the other. Thus, information from the motor programming systems (or \"motor set\") may contribute to coding of spatial location by hippocampal neurons. Spatially selective discharge of hippocampal neurons was abolished under conditions of restraint in which the animal had learned that locomotion was impossible. Therefore, hippocampal neuronal activity may reflect the association of movements with their spatial consequences.\r"

Functional membership of neurons in central networks is thus not fixed, and long-lasting neuromodulatory influences, controlled at least in part by sensory inputs, can switch neurons from one network to another.\r"

  ".W": "Theories for the evolution of brain weight in mammals suggest that closely related species have diverged largely as a result of selection for differences in body weight, but that differences among more distantly related species have arisen due to greater net directional selection on brain weight. This pattern of changing selection causes brain weight to evolve more slowly than body weight among closely related species, such as those in the same genus, than among more distantly related species, such as those from different families or orders; a phenomenon known as the \"taxon-level effect.\" Thus, brain weight differs more for a given difference in body weight as the species compared are more distantly related. An alternative explanation for the taxon-level effect is proposed. Distantly related species are more likely to inhabit different ecological conditions than are more closely related species. Where the taxon-level effect occurs, brain weight appears to have evolved in response to the demands of these different ecological conditions. As a consequence, brain weight differs more among distantly related species, for any given difference in body weight, than among closely related species. This effect, rather than a progressive pattern of changing selection pressures, may account for the taxon-level effect in mammals.\r"

Because there is a strong negative relation between number of siblings and scores on tests measuring verbal ability, recent reductions in sibling number would be expected to contribute to enhanced verbal ability and increasing years of schooling for those born now in the United States.\r"

Observations of stresses acting in the limb bones of different sized mammals during strenuous activity, however, indicate that peak bone stress is independent of size (maintaining a safety factor of between 2 and 4). It appears that similar peak bone stresses and muscle stresses in large and small mammals are achieved primarily by a size-dependent change in locomotor limb posture: small animals run with crouched postures, whereas larger species run more upright. By adopting an upright posture, large animals align their limbs more closely with the ground reaction force, substantially reducing the forces that their muscles must exert (proportional to body mass) and hence, the forces that their bones must resist, to counteract joint moments. This change in limb posture to maintain locomotor stresses within safe limits, however, likely limits the maneuverability and accelerative capability of large animals.\r"

This analysis of 60 invertebrate-dominated community food webs confirms the existence of all but one of these properties in such webs and addresses a common concern held by critics of food web theory that observed food web properties may be sensitive to trophic aggregation. The food web statistics (chain length; predator/prey ratio; fraction of top, intermediate, and bottom species; and rigid circuits) are scaling in the sense that they remain roughly invariant over a wide range of data resolution. As such, within present standards of reporting food web data, these statistics may be used to compare systems whose trophic data are resolved differently within a factor of 2.\r"

However receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity toward an exogenous substrate were reduced in partially purified insulin receptors from the proband's lymphocytes that had been transformed by Epstein-Barr virus. The insulin resistance associated with this mutated gene was inherited by the proband from her mother as an apparently autosomal dominant trait.

This supranucleosome organization correlates with the resting state of chromatin, and it is therefore possible that the linker histones play an active role in the control of chromatin activity. The effect of H5 has been directly determined by expression of an inducible transfected H5 gene in rat sarcoma cells, which do not produce H5. Transfection resulted in the reversible inhibition of DNA replication and arrest of cells in G1, at which time H5 concentrations approached that of terminally differentiated avian erythrocytes. The arrest of proliferation was accompanied by specific changes in gene expression probably related to the cell cycle block. The selectivity of these effects suggest that H5 plays an active role in the control of DNA replication and cell proliferation.\r"

This is a retrospective review of 58 patients who underwent hemipelvectomy, disarticulation of the hip and above knee or forequarter amputation for advanced or recurrent malignant melanoma. Major amputation with curative intent was performed upon 43 patients. There were three deaths that occurred 30 days postoperatively (7 per cent). Intransit metastasis was one of the indications for amputation in 33 patients, and local control of disease was achieved in 30 of 43 patients. The median time to recurrence in those patients who did have a recurrence was 12 months (a range of 18 days to 16 years). Fifteen of 40 patients who survived the operation had no evidence of disease five years after undergoing a major amputation. Age, sex, primary site, stage of disease at diagnosis and amputation, disease-free interval and positive node status at any time during the course of the disease were not predictive of the outcome. Neurovascular involvement with melanoma and positive margins of resection predicted early failure. A palliative amputation for impending major vascular disruption or extensive, fungating disease was performed upon 15 patients. There was one death 30 days after the operation, and generally, hospitalization did not exceed 30 days. Median survival time was five months. All of the patients died of local or distant disease within 33 months of treatment. Local recurrence preceded death in nine of 15 patients.\r"

Antacids are commonly used to accomplish this, but whatever the agent used, proper pH monitoring by aspiration of gastric fluid is necessary. This technique is labor intensive, but alternative methods have not proved practical. A simple pH probe in a nasogastric tube was tested to evaluate its accuracy in determining gastric pH in critically ill patients. Thirty-one patients in the surgical intensive care unit were studied for an average of 5.2 days with a range of one to 21 days. A nasogastric tube with a graphite and antimony pH sensor implanted in the tip (GrapHProbe ST, Zinetics Medical) was placed in each patient. The probe can be attached to a pH meter to read the gastric pH. Double aspiration samples from the nasogastric tube were taken for pH determination by pH paper, which guided antacid treatment to keep the pH equal to or greater than 5.0. Patients were monitored at two hour intervals and a total of 1,940 paired measurements were available for comparison. Comparison of values was based on a correlation of 1.5 pH units or whether or not the difference between the readings would have altered antacid therapy. Seventy-one per cent of the paired measurements were within 1.5 pH units. In only 4.3 per cent of the measurements would antacid treatment have been withheld based on the pH probe when compared with the aspiration pH. In 21 per cent of the measurements, treatment was indicated by the pH probe but not by the aspiration pH. The pH probe is a reliable, rapid method for monitoring gastric pH. It is less labor intensive than gastric aspiration and provides similar information in the patient at risk for stress gastritis.\r"

Despite conventionally acceptable results from preoperative hepatic function tests in 56 patients undergoing extensive hepatic resection for tumours (47 metastatic, six hepatomas and three adenomas), however, five patients died of hepatic failure. Among the many preoperative and intraoperative risk factors studied, the important factors in the group with hepatic failure were very high levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (p less than 0.05) in the presence of normal levels of bilirubin and large tumor, preoperative administration of chemotherapy, the presence of hepatomas rather than metastatic carcinoma (p = 0.083) and intraoperative blood loss of greater than 5,000 milliliters (p = 0.03). The patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy or those with hepatoma showed a minimal rise of alkaline phosphatase (p less than 0.03) and a minimal regeneration of liver on computed tomographic (CT) scan after hepatic resection. In the group with hepatic failure, a consistent postoperative pattern of increasing bilirubin with normal or subnormal alkaline phosphatase levels corresponded with lack of regeneration of liver on repeated CT scans. Conversely, the pattern of decreasing bilirubin with reciprocal increase in alkaline phosphatase corresponded with hepatic regeneration on CT scan in the group of survivors. Thus, we observe that alkaline phosphatase is a good indicator of hepatic regeneration in the absence of jaundice in patients after hepatectomy. To avoid postoperative hepatic failure, we recommend more discriminant tests than conventional hepatic function tests in patients with large tumors associated with high alkaline phosphatase levels, preoperative chemotherapy and hepatoma even without pre-existing cirrhosis or hepatitis.\r"

Two patients arrived in cardiac arrest, necessitating thoracotomy performed in the emergency room. Thirty (65 per cent) patients were hemodynamically stable and underwent emergent diagnostic angiography prior to arterial repair. Lateral or end to end arterial repairs were used in the majority. Two ascending aortic injuries required cardiopulmonary bypass. Forty-three of 46 patients survived.

The treatment of choice with regard to prevention of post-thrombotic disorders is controversial. Pregnant women represent a therapeutic problem because thrombolysis is hazardous to the fetus. We have performed thrombectomy and temporary arteriovenous fistula in combination with anticoagulant treatment upon all pregnant or recently pregnant women coming to our department with acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis from August 1985 to March 1987. In this period, eight pregnant women and one woman 12 days after cesarean section were admitted. This is an incidence of 0.83 per 1,000 deliveries. All of the women were evaluated with a mean follow-up time of 15 months. Six of nine patients were clinically asymptomatic. Six had a normal ambulatory strain gauge volumetry and seven, a normal occlusion strain gauge plethysmography. Two women delivered by cesarean section, one woman had an induced abortion because of the disease, two women delivered after partus provocatus and four delivered spontaneously. We conclude that thrombectomy and temporary arteriovenous fistula together with heparin is a safe treatment of acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis during pregnancy. There is no need to interrupt the pregnancies except for obstetric reasons.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective trial was conducted to compare intrathoracic and cervical anastomoses after esophagectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the middle or lower one-third of the esophagus. One hundred and twenty-three patients were randomized to have either a cervical or thoracic anastomosis. Thirty-one patients were subsequently excluded either because esophagectomy was performed without thoracotomy or the tumor was unresectable or because the randomization protocol was not complied with. Transfusion requirements and operating time were similar for the 49 patients having esophagectomy by way of the laparotomy and right thoracotomy (TA) and the 43 patients who underwent laparotomy, right thoracotomy and cervicotomy (CA). Forty-three per cent of the CA and 49 per cent of the TA patients had involved lymph nodes. An esophagectomy incorporating a cervical anastomosis resulted in a significantly greater margin of macroscopically normal esophagus above the tumor (median of 4.0 versus 1.5 centimeters for TA). A leak was significantly more frequent after cervical anastomosis (26 per cent) than thoracic (4 per cent) (p less than 0.002). Respiratory complications were more frequent with a thoracic anastomosis, but this was not statistically significant. Thirty day mortality rates were similar for the two groups: 14.3 per cent, TA, and 9.3 per cent, CA (p = N.S.). Postoperative strictures occurred in 14 per cent of TA and 23 per cent of CA patients and were most common after an anastomotic leak. The survival patterns of the two groups were similar. The median survival time for CA patients was 23 months and for TA, 20 months. Excluding hospital mortality, 47 per cent of patients were alive at two years and 30 per cent at 40 months. Survival was related to extent of disease. The greater length of tumor-free esophagus removed with a cervical anastomosis did not result in an improved long term survival period, but was associated with a significantly higher incidence of anastomotic fistula.\r"

The development of the new ultra thin biliary scopes makes visual examination of the biliary tree possible through a normal cystic duct lumen. The operative approach to the gallbladder is unchanged. The indications for choledochoscopy of the cystic duct are the same as for operative cholangiogram. This examination can be of better quality and is less expensive than an operative roentgenogram. Unlike an operative cholangiogram, which at best visualized the bile ducts, the ultra thin scope gives the surgeon additional information concerning the ampulla of Vater, differentiating ductal spasm from stricture by its tactile feedback through the Bakes-like probe. When disease is present, it is possible for the scope to become a therapeutic instrument without the need for choledochotomy and its associated morbidity and cost. The high incidence of choledocholithiasis in this small series may be attributed to the sample size. It is also possible that more occult stones were found. If this is the case, most of these stones are being passed spontaneously and are never clinically apparent. It is those few patients who have small, occult stones that do not pass who benefit most from this new technology. This study was undertaken to develop and investigate the potential uses of a new biliary scope. These scopes require a learning period before the entire biliary tract can be visualized, but have the potential to be of significant value in the diagnosis and treatment of biliary tract disease.\r"

Forty-seven popliteal aneurysms were atherosclerotic while three were related to entrapment of the popliteal artery. Fourteen asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms were observed preoperatively during a mean period of 26 months. Ischemic complications developed in five of these. At admission, 16 limbs were asymptomatic (group 1) while the other 34 limbs presented with ischemic symptoms (group 2). No operation was performed upon three limbs, and another two were surgically explored and amputated. No operative deaths resulted from 45 vascular reconstructions. Results from follow-up study of one to 176 months (a mean of 57 months) revealed a late patency rate of 62 per cent. The late patency rate of autologous saphenous vein (ASV) was 100 per cent; polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Dacron (polyester fiber) grafts had a patency rate of 74 and 34 per cent, respectively (ASV versus PTFE, p = N.S.; ASV versus Dacron, p less than 0.002). The rate of late salvage of limbs was 88 per cent. The bypass grafts of group 1 and those performed upon limbs with good runoff fared significantly better than others (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001). The risk of natural complications of popliteal aneurysms and the good results from surgical treatment suggested that a revascularization procedure in the asymptomatic stage is always recommended. The use of PTFE grafts for repair of popliteal aneurysms is justified when the ASV is not available. The use of Dacron grafts is no longer indicated.\r"

With time, intra-abdominal pressure gradually enlarges this space to bring about the hernia. To prevent a hernia from developing after an enterostomy, a new principle of enterostomy construction is demonstrated. After proper positioning of the intestine within the tunnel, it is returned to the abdomen to allow accurate placement of sutures. These sutures bring together the lateral aspect of the tunnel and the remote side of the intestine. If no space is allowed, no hernia will occur.\r"

  ".U": "89298609\r", 
  ".W": "Hepatic dysfunction after portacaval shunting (PCS) has been attributed to loss of portal perfusion to the liver. Proponents of selective systemic shunting state that reduced encephalopathy and hepatic dysfunction with this procedure result from the maintenance of portal perfusion to the liver through the hypertensive mesenteric venous circulation. We questioned the importance of maintaining the diminished portal flow to the cirrhotic liver because hepatofugal flow is known to develop in many of these patients. We sought to further define mechanisms that may contribute to the maintenance of critical flow to the liver in compensated hepatic cirrhosis. We demonstrated a primary relationship between mesenteric venous hypertension (MVH) and increased hepatic arterial blood flow after diversion of portal blood flow. Fifteen dogs had vena caval stenosis above an end-to-side PCS to establish MVH and deprive the liver of portal blood flow. Another 15 dogs had end-to-side PCS alone. A half hour after shunting, hepatic arterial blood flow had increased significantly in all dogs. Hemodynamic parameters remained stable throughout. Six weeks later, mesenteric pressure increased 98% +/- 3% with intracaval stenosis (from 9.6 +/- 0.1 to 19.0 +/- 0.3 cm H2O). Mesenteric pressure was unchanged with PCS alone (9.0 +/- 0.1 cm H2O). Increased hepatic arterial flow was significantly elevated in all dogs above pre-shunt values by 6 weeks postshunt. With MVH, however, further augmentation in hepatic arterial flow was noted in the chronic state (1.5 +/- 0.1 vs 0.9 +/- 0.1 ml/min/gm, p less than 0.05). There was significant correlation between MVH and increased hepatic arterial flow in the chronic state (r = 0.79, p = 0.05). Hepatic arterial flow 6 weeks after PCS with MVH was associated with lower blood ammonia and improved hepatocellular function compared with animals with PCS alone. These results support the hypothesis that MVH is important in maintaining blood supply--beyond providing driving force for sustained portal flow to the liver. This is an important consideration in the medical and surgical management of portal hypertension, a condition in which profound reduction in portal pressure may negatively affect compensatory hepatic arterial blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "A new method of measuring blood flow to forearms and hands during reactive hyperemia is described. Subjects are positioned with forearms and hands over a gamma camera, and the circulation below the elbows is isolated for 4 minutes with pneumatic cuffs. The remaining blood pool is labeled with technetium-99m-labeled human serum albumin given via a vein in the dorsum of the foot. The rate of rise of activity in the arms after cuff release is measured from the gradient of time activity curves, and these are calibrated for flow by counting a sample of venous blood. Blood flow per unit volume is obtained from measurements of the limb volume, done by water displacement. Results for eight normal control subjects showed a mean flow per unit volume to forearm plus hand of 32.9 +/- 6.4 ml/100 ml/min and to hand alone 36.5 +/- 6.9 ml/100 ml/min. Case studies of patients with a variety of large- and small-vessel diseases are presented, illustrating the use of the technique to aid diagnosis and measure response to treatment.\r"

We recently saw three patients with rupture of the left hemidiaphragm associated with renal artery injury. The finding of a perinephric hematoma in a multiply injured patient with an ipsilateral diaphragmatic rupture prompted evaluation of the renal artery. With massive injury, the kidney may be displaced superiorly when the diaphragm ruptures, producing injury to the ipsilateral renal artery. This association has not been emphasized in the literature. The finding of a perinephric hematoma on the left should prompt full evaluation of the renal arteries if seen in association with diaphragmatic rupture.\r"

Five patients had papillary cancer, four follicular, three anaplastic, and two medullary. Patients with uninodular toxic goiter had a low rate of associated malignancy (0.27%, 3/1108). In contrast, patients with multinodular toxic goiter had an incidence of 1.63% (11/676). No patient with Graves' disease (n = 64) had a carcinoma. Extensive use of fine-needle aspiration biopsy enabled preoperative diagnosis in a majority of the cases (9/14, 64%). We conclude that the incidence of coexisting thyroid malignancy and hyperthyroidism is rare in our endemic iodine-deficiency goiter area.\r"

Thirty-one of the patients with resectable HCCs had already been treated with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the liver before they were referred to us. The clinical values of preoperative TAE were retrospectively evaluated for those 31 patients and for the remaining 107 patients without TAE. There were no substantial differences between the two study groups in the clinical and histopathologic backgrounds. No differences were observed in the extent of liver resection, estimated blood loss during surgery, and operation time. During surgery, however, troublesome intra-abdominal complications relevant to TAE were encountered in 15 patients, and detection of tumors was impossible, even with intraoperative ultrasonography, in five patients in the group with TAE. Such findings were not present in any of the patients without TAE. Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were similar in the two groups. There was no significant difference in the rate of recurrence of tumor in the liver, but the recurrence time was significantly shorter in the group with TAE. TAE did not improve the long-term survival rates in patients either with or without cirrhosis. Results of our study seem to indicate that preoperative TAE is meaningless in the treatment of resectable HCCs and therefore should be avoided, particularly in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver.\r"

  ".U": "89298623\r", 
  ".W": "Because high calcium concentration in vitro stimulates muscle proteolysis, calcium has been implicated in the pathogenesis of increased muscle breakdown in different catabolic conditions. Protein breakdown in skeletal muscle is increased during sepsis, but the effect of sepsis on muscle calcium uptake and content is not known. In this study the influence of sepsis, induced in rats by cecal ligation and puncture, on muscle calcium uptake and content was studied. Sixteen hours after cecal ligation and puncture or sham operation, calcium content of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles was determined with an atomic absorption spectrometer. Calcium uptake was measured in intact SOL muscles incubated in the presence of calcium 45 (45Ca) for between 1 and 120 minutes. Total and myofibrillar protein breakdown was determined in SOL muscles, incubated in the presence of different calcium concentrations (0; 2.5; 5.0 mmol/L), and measured as release into the incubation medium of tyrosine and 3-methylhistidine (3-MH), respectively. Calcium content was increased by 51% (p less than 0.001) during sepsis in SOL and by 10% (p less than 0.05) in EDL muscle. There was no difference in 45Ca uptake between control and septic muscles during the early phase (1 to 5 minutes) of incubation. During more extended incubation (30 to 120 minutes), muscles from septic rats took up significantly more 45Ca than control muscles (p less than 0.05). Tyrosine release by incubated SOL muscles from control and septic rats was increased when calcium was added to the incubation medium, and at a calcium concentration of 2.5 mmol/L, the increase in tyrosine release was greater in septic than in control muscle. Addition of calcium to the incubation medium did not affect 3-MH release in control or septic muscle. The results suggest that calcium uptake and content in skeletal muscle are increased during sepsis and that high calcium concentrations in vitro stimulate nonmyofibrillar protein breakdown. Muscles from septic animals may be more sensitive to the effect of calcium in vitro than muscles from nonseptic rats. Whether increased calcium uptake and content in skeletal muscle is partly responsible for accelerated muscle proteolysis during sepsis remains to be determined.\r"

Before PDT there was a gradient of PO2 from the superficial layers of the tumor (PO2 = 46 +/- 6 mm Hg) toward the center of the tumor (PO2 = 10 +/- 1 mm Hg). Mean tumor PO2 (21 +/- 2 mm Hg) was significantly reduced to 3 +/- 1 mm Hg 1 hour after PDT, and this reduction in PO2 persisted 4 hours (8 +/- 2 mm Hg) and 24 hours (6 +/- 1 mm Hg) after PDT. The largest percentage decrease in PO2 occurred at a depth of only 50 microns into the tumor. Inasmuch as PDT has been shown to decrease blood flow, our data suggest that PDT actions on blood vessels in the peripheral areas of the tumor are of major importance for eliciting the tumor hypoxia that contributes to tumor necrosis after PDT.\r"

  ".W": "The present policies for allowing nonresident aliens access to organ transplantation are neither fair nor consistent. They apply only to some transplants, and they take no account of their discriminatory effect among foreigners. Much less do they deal with the meaning of fair access, given our complete ignorance of the number and character of those outside the United States in need of a transplant. Most strikingly, present policy prohibits discrimination based on where a patient lives in part by imposing it based on where the patient is to receive a transplant, here or abroad. The one-list policy is more a result of political compromise, institutional interest, and the misapplication of the principle of professional autonomy than of any consistent policy or logic. In this mishmash of justification, one argument does stand out--that sharing organs with nonresidents ought to be done on the grounds of charity. Yet even here, the present form of this position is inadequate, perhaps because it has not been systematically applied to organ distribution issues. An argument for charity contains two elements, the nature of the obligation and the subject on whom the obligation rests. In its ordinary form, the obligation of charity requires a transfer of resources from wealth to poverty. A more subtle and complex formulation is required to apply this obligation to the conditions of universal poverty pertaining in organ transplantation. It remains to be seen if this is possible. There is also the question of to whom the argument must be made. A minimal requirement of charity is that one shares one's own resources, not those of another. Inevitably, this brings us to the perennial question of organ distribution: Whose organs are these? We can easily say whose they are not; they do not belong to hospital administrators, academic researchers, transplant surgeons, or organ procurement agencies. Insofar as they are national resources, Congress may be able to stake a claim; but insofar as giving organs to nonresident imposes sacrifices on residents awaiting an organ, perhaps they should be consulted. And their right to refuse must be accepted, for in organ distribution, the only real charity the well have a right to dispense is not to judge the sick.\r"

Inappropriate prescription writing accounted for 51% of all investigations during this period, with controlled drugs, primarily opiates and benzodiazepines, accounting for most complaints. Of 130 physicians investigated, more than half had previous complaints; 50 were ultimately restricted or disciplined by the board. Inappropriate prescribing of controlled drugs is probably underdetected and frequently repeated. Available literature suggests that inappropriate prescribing of other drugs, especially antibiotics, is extremely common, but such problems were rarely identified by the current discovery and review processes of the Oregon board. Inappropriate prescribing will require increased attention from physician educators and licensing boards.\r"

The bactericidal titers against two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus were considerably lower, the median peak being 1:2 at all dose levels. Measured inhibitory and bactericidal titers at five minutes and one hour postinfusion were significantly greater than those predicted (measured serum ciprofloxacin concentration to minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] or minimum bactericidal concentration [MBC]) for only one strain of E. coli. Intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin 100-200 mg produce high and sustained serum bactericidal titers against highly susceptible bacteria; considerably lower levels of activity are seen against bacteria having higher MICs and MBCs but still considered susceptible to the drug.\r"

Eleven adult volunteers received tobramycin 1.5 mg/kg iv infused over 30 minutes through the distal lumen of the dual-lumen catheter every eight hours for two doses. Multiple blood samples were obtained concurrently from the proximal lumen of the catheter and a single-lumen catheter in the contralateral arm after each dose. Blood samples were also obtained through the distal lumen before and 30 minutes after the end of the infusion. Accurate blood samples were obtainable through the dual-lumen catheter in only 5 of 11 subjects due to either infiltration or difficulties in catheter placement. In the subjects from whom accurate blood samples were obtained, approximately 20 minutes postinfusion was the amount of time required before measured tobramycin serum concentrations were similar between the arm in which the drug was infused (site of the dual-lumen catheter) and the contralateral arm. At standard times for obtainment of trough (just prior to the infusion) and peak (30 minutes after the end of a 30-minute infusion) tobramycin serum concentrations from the proximal lumen of the dual-lumen catheter were numerically similar to those obtained from the contralateral arm. This preliminary study indicates that the dual-lumen catheter provides accurate aminoglycoside concentrations when patent relative to blood withdrawal and if peak blood samples are obtained at least 30 minutes postinfusion through the recommended lumen. However, further study in a larger number of subjects is required before routine use of this device can be recommended.\r"

The time to a given percentage of the eventual steady-state concentration has previously been considered to be dependent only on the elimination half-life. This is incorrect. Although the rate of drug accumulation in the body is dependent only on the elimination half-life, the time to a given percentage of steady state is dependent on both the elimination half-life of the drug and the initial concentration. This paper presents the mathematical proof of this concept, computer simulations demonstrating the use of these equations, and nomograms for use in clinical practice. The use of this method allows serum drug concentrations to be evaluated earlier than previously predicted after changes in the dosing rate.\r"

Neither the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council nor the World Health Organization has recognized the need for increasing the vitamin and mineral allowances for healthy elderly adults above those recommended for healthy young adults. It is important to recognize, however, that the elderly are at greater risk of developing nutritional deficiencies as a result of acute and chronic diseases, drug use, and social isolation, and they require careful monitoring.\r"

Of a total of 58 hospitalizations, lasting an average of 6.3 days, only eight were made from the family practice clinic and only four family practice patients were actually admitted to the family practice ward service. Furthermore, more than half of the admissions were to the internal medicine or the obstetrics and gynecology services. This would appear to be inappropriate, given the fact that family physicians are trained to care for acutely ill adult patients and many obstetrical and gynecological patients. A review of hospital admissions records revealed a variety of issues in continuity of care. Recommendations are made regarding possible solutions and further research in this area.\r"

A chart review was conducted in a family practice residency model office to determine if screening was being performed and what factors influenced it (CAD risk factors, demographics, and insurance status). Forty-three percent of the patients had a cholesterol test on record, of which only 10% were ordered specifically to check the cholesterol. Demographic characteristics, insurance, and CAD risk factors did not influence the rate of testing, with the single exception of hypertension; an educational conference and the development of a practice policy between the two time periods did not change the rate of screening.\r"

Students on clerkships had fewer patient encounters than on preceptorships (127.6 vs. 320.0 per six week rotation). In addition, clerkship students saw more patients with trauma, vaginitis, and hypertension, although preceptorship students saw more patients with health maintenance, arteriosclerotic problems, lower respiratory infections, and dermatologic problems. These results suggest that medical students should be encouraged to participate in both a third year clerkship and a senior preceptorship, because they represent different and complimentary clinical experiences in family medicine.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the temporal effects of various types of mental stress and physical exercise on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in seven normal volunteers and nine patients with coronary artery disease. Three types of psychological stress were administered: mental arithmetic, the Stroop color word test, and a personally relevant speaking task. In the normal volunteers the LVEF response was either flat or increased (p less than 0.05) compared to the baseline value during the mental tasks and increased by a mean of 10 +/- 5% (p less than 0.05) during exercise. In contrast, in patients with coronary disease in whom LVEF did not increase greater than or equal to 5% during exercise, LVEF decreased significantly during the mental tasks (p less than 0.05 for arithmetic and Stroop tasks). Typically LVEF decreased quickly during mental stress with an immediate rebound after intervention. Decreases in LVEF during mental stress occurred without chest pain and were not associated with ECG changes. In patients with coronary disease in whom LVEF increased normally with exercise (LVEF increase greater than or equal to 5%), no significant changes in LVEF occurred during mental stress. The heart rate x systolic blood pressure double product during mental stress was significantly less than that achieved during exercise (p less than 0.05) in each normal subject and patient. Thus psychological stress can provoke acute decreases in LVEF in patients with coronary disease and exercise-inducible dysfunction. The silent nature of the mental stress-induced abnormalities and their occurrence at a lower physiologic workload compared to abnormalities during exercise parallel characteristics of transient ischemia noted during ambulatory monitoring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Mortality, morbidity, quality of life, and left ventricular (LV) function were evaluated in 49 patients after aortic valve replacement with the St. Jude prosthesis. Total follow-up was 2577 patient-months; survivors were followed-up for 4 to 7 years by clinical examination and echocardiography. The actuarial survival rate at 6 years was 79.6%, and there were no valve-related deaths. The linearized rates for thromboembolism and hemorrhage were 0.93% and 3.26% per patient-year, respectively. In 34% of the survivors the quality of life was poor. In the first three postoperative months, patients with aortic stenosis (n = 12) had a significant decrease in the muscle cross-sectional area (p less than 0.01) and patients with aortic regurgitation (n = 11) had decreases in both LV end-diastolic diameter (p less than 0.05) and cross-sectional area (p less than 0.001). All of these results were maintained at 5 years without modification of LV systolic function. Despite the good overall results, six patients deteriorated and had major LV dilatation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified two independent preoperative variables associated with a poor outcome defined as death of LV dysfunction (p less than 0.05): age and end-diastolic diameter. Thus meticulous follow-up showed a high incidence of hemorrhage and a poor quality of life in many of the survivors. It was concluded that in high-risk patients (age and end-diastolic diameter) surgery should probably be considered earlier.\r"

Patients with constrictive pericarditis had more rapid peak left ventricular filling rates (mean 5.62, range 4.23 to 7.32 end-diastolic volumes [EDV] per second) compared to control subjects 3.44, range 2.62 to 4.45 EDV/sec, p less than 0.05). Heart rate-corrected first one-third and first one-half diastolic filling fractions were greater in patients with preoperative constrictive pericarditis compared to members of the restrictive cardiomyopathy and control groups p less than 0.05). Following pericardiectomy, patients with constrictive pericarditis had significant decreases in peak filling rate and corrected filling fractions, and all diastolic filling measurements were indistinguishable from those of control subjects. These noninvasively obtained data indicate that patients with preoperative constrictive pericarditis have an increased rate of left ventricular early diastolic filling compared to patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy and control subjects, and that these findings return to normal following surgical removal of the pericardium.\r"

In patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) who are recovering from MI, a larger functioning myocardial mass may remain. However, the frequency of ASH in these patients has not yet been described. Predischarge echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, and treadmill stress tests were performed in 403 consecutive patients who had recovered from acute MI. Eighty-eight patients (22%) had ASH with septal thickness greater than or equal to 1.3, and 32 (8%) had septal thickness greater than or equal to 1.5 cm. One hundred thirty-six patients who had recovered from a first MI and had no ASH served as control subjects. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the group with ASH was significantly higher than in control subjects (61% vs 50%; p = 0.0001). LV end-diastolic diameter (LVD(d] and E point septal separation (EPSS) were smaller in the group with ASH (4.9 cm and 5.4 mm) than in the control group (5.5 cm and 10.5 mm). The frequency of positive treadmill test results, angina pectoris, recurrent MI, heart failure, and death during a 22-month follow-up period was similar in both groups. Fifty subjects in the control group were matched with 50 patients from the group with ASH on the basis of maximal level of creatine phosphokinase, location of infarct, and presence or absence of hypertension, and the difference between the two groups was even more marked (LVEF 48% vs 61%, respectively; p = 0.0004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied 23 normal adults and four patient groups with conditions commonly associated with left atrial dilatation: mitral regurgitation (14), mitral stenosis (16), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (13), and constrictive pericarditis (7). Statistically significant differences were found between the constrictive pericarditis group and each of the other groups. Angle P was less than 150 degrees in 0 of 23 normal individuals, in 0 of 14 with mitral regurgitation, in 1 of 16 with mitral stenosis, in 0 of 13 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and in five of seven with constrictive pericarditis. DA minus DV exceeded 20 mm in 0 of 23 normal individuals, one of four with mitral regurgitation, in 6 of 16 with mitral stenosis, in 0 of 13 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and in five of seven patients with constrictive pericarditis; We conclude that angle P greater than 150 degrees suggests constrictive pericarditis; DA minus DV greater than 20 mm suggests constrictive pericarditis if mitral stenosis can be excluded.\r"

LVME (r = 0.91, SEE +/- 41 gm) were more accurate than LVMN for all 2DE, but LVMN equalled LVME in accuracy for technically good 2DE. Interobserver variability was 36 gm, or 17% of LVM for all 2DE, and fell to 27 gm, or 12% of LVM for technically good 2DE. Segmental wall motion abnormalities and time from 2DE to death did not influence measurement accuracy significantly. LVM measurements by the 2DE truncated ellipsoid formula are accurate and reproducible in patients with normal and abnormal hearts.\r"

The current study was designed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the technique for the evaluation of all major anatomic elements of the heart affected in simple and complex congenital heart disease. MR images of 51 patients (31 males and 20 females, ages 3 to 69 years) with a total of 110 congenital heart lesions were reviewed by a panel of two cardiac radiologists and one pediatric cardiologist, who assessed the cardiac pathoanatomy without knowledge of clinical details and assigned a confidence level to each diagnosis. The true diagnosis was established independently by the findings of angiocardiography and catheterization as well as by surgery, where applicable. ROC curves were generated from the responses, and the sensitivity at a specificity level of 90% was determined. MRI was shown to have a high sensitivity in evaluating great vessel relationships (100%), thoracic aorta abnormalities (94%), ASDs (91%) and VSDs (100%), visceroatrial situs (100%), and loop (100%). Three of five anomalies of the pulmonary and systemic veins were diagnosed by MRI. Right ventricular outflow obstructions (95%) were detected with a much higher sensitivity than lesions of the other valves (aortic valve 52%, mitral valve 62%, tricuspid valve 76%). Spin-echo MRI is a sensitive and specific method for the noninvasive assessment of congenital heart disease, with limitations in the evaluation of some valvular anomalies.\r"

VO2 was higher in boys than girls and similar in black and white subjects. Exercise heart rate was significantly correlated with blood pressure in white boys and girls and with obesity in white and black persons. A small but significant association between exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure was demonstrated in white boys and girls independent of age and obesity.

The present study investigated the effects of administering an endogenous vasodilator prostanoid, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), in the stunned myocardium (15 minutes of coronary artery occlusion and 3 hours of reperfusion) of anesthetized dogs. The percentage of regional myocardial segment shortening (%SS) after administration of PGE1 by two routes, intravenously (1 microgram/kg/min) or intraatrially (0.1 microgram/kg/min), to avoid pulmonary metabolism, 15 minutes before and throughout the period of occlusion, was compared to %SS in a control group treated with saline solution. Nearly equivalent reductions in mean arterial pressure during occlusion compared to pretreatment control (PTC) values were produced by intravenous (33%) or intraatrial (25%) PGE1. There was no difference in transmural myocardial blood flow (radioactive microsphere technique) in the ischemic region between the PGE1-treated and control groups at any time. Although there were no differences in %SS in the nonischemic region between groups throughout the experiment, postischemic recovery of segment function in the ischemic-reperfused area was significantly improved (p less than 0.05) at all times during reperfusion by intravenous PGE1 (%SS of PTC: 30 minutes = 65 +/- 8; 3 hours = 58 +/- 7) or intraatrial PGE1 (%SS of PTC: 30 minutes = 57 +/- 12; 3 hours = 50 +/- 4) compared to the control group (%SS of PTC: 30 minutes = 25 +/- 13; 3 hours = 10 +/- 13). Thus treatment with PGE1 attenuates postischemic contractile dysfunction in the stunned myocardium.2+ both.\r"

The intimal surfaces of 70 pairs of arteries were compared by light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy. The mammary arteries had a continuous endothelial lining, but the coronary arteries showed incomplete coverage of the thickened intima. In affected vessels the endothelial cells showed loss of attachment to adjacent cells and to the underlying tissue. It was concluded that the progressive intimal thickening of the human coronary artery, which develops early in life and is associated with defects in the internal elastic lamina, is also associated with endothelial cell separation and detachment, with the formation of denuded areas on the intimal surface.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the risk of embolism resulting from plaque fragmentation during laser angioplasty with metal-capped optical fibers, laser energy of 4, 8, and 12 W for 10 or 20 seconds was delivered through these fibers to 60 coronary endarterectomy segments fitted in a silicone tube filled with saline solution. Twenty specimens manipulated in the same way but without delivering laser energy were used as controls. The effluent was filtered through in-line filters of 225, 70, and 25 microns. Treatment with laser energy resulted in weight loss and shortening of the specimens compared to control specimens (23 +/- 4 mg versus 5.4 +/- 0.8 mg; p less than 0.001 and 0.2 +/- 0.02 mm versus 2.5 +/- 0.5 mm; p less than 0.001). However, this also produced significant debris formation for all combinations of power and time (up to 275 +/- 38 micrograms versus 155 +/- 21 micrograms in controls). Results of scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of fragments up to 300 microns in diameter. Another potential hazard of laser angioplasty with metal-capped optical fibers in thromboembolism. This was studied by delivering laser energy through metal-capped fibers during perfusion with aliquots of blood at 5 or 40 ml/min. At each flow rate nine aliquots were treated with either 4, 8, or 12 W for 3, 6, or 9 seconds and a tenth was used as a control aliquot. The effluent was filtered with five filters between 225 microns and 25 microns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, 20% and 40% of these patients will not manifest inducible ventricular arrhythmias during subsequent electrophysiologic studies. The optimal management of these patients has been controversial. In a consecutive series of 100 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with documented VF, six were identified by either clinical or electrophysiologic data as having a nonventricular arrhythmia as the immediate precursor of VF. Two of these patients had rapid, hypotensive supraventricular arrhythmias induced with programmed cardiac stimulation. In four patients, bradyarrhythmias (sinus arrest two; atrioventricular block two) preceded and caused the episode of VF. Therapy directed at these nonventricular arrhythmias prevented recurrence of cardiac arrest in all patients. In survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, nonventricular arrhythmias represent a treatable potential etiology that may be overlooked during the patient's evaluation.\r"

Fourteen patients with multiform PVCs and RFs underwent 8-hour, two-channel continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. After a 2-hour baseline, procainamide was administered intravenously at 25 mg/min until PVC suppression or 1000 mg. Multiple regression analysis was used to relate the frequencies of repetitive forms initiated by PVCs of the most frequent QRS morphology (M1) and the second most frequent QRS morphology (M2) to the frequency of M1 and M2 single PVCs. Parallel changes in the frequency of M1 RFs and M1 PVCs occurred in 9 of 14 patients and parallel changes in the frequency of M2 RFs and M2 PVCs occurred in 7 of 14 patients (i.e., the relationships were concordant). In two patients, M1 RFs related to M2 PVC frequency; in three patients, M2 RFs related to M1 PVC frequency (i.e., the relationships were discordant). Thus concordant frequency distributions were present in 16 of 28 (57%) comparisons, while a discordant relationship occurred in only 5 of 28 (18%) comparisons (p less than 0.005). In conclusion, there is frequent concordance in the frequency distribution of single multiform PVCs and of RFs initiated by PVCs of the same QRS morphology during a pharmacologic intervention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Following heparin administration during electrophysiologic testing in 10 patients receiving quinidine, there were significant increases in the mean (+/- SD) right ventricular effective refractory period (266 +/- 24 versus 279 +/- 23; p less than 0.025), free fatty acid concentration (515 +/- 213 versus 1071 +/- 359 mmol/L; p less than 0.001), and unbound quinidine concentration (0.3 +/- 0.1 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml; p less than 0.001) but no changes in heart rate, corrected QT interval, or total plasma quinidine concentration. Ten control patients showed no change in the right ventricular effective refractory period following heparin administration. These findings were consistent with a heparin-induced increase in unbound drug concentration and activity that was limited to the vascular compartment. Eleven patients studied on day 3 (+/- 1) and day 10 (+/- 3) during an acute myocardial infarction showed a significant decrease in unbound quinidine fraction (12 +/- 4% versus 9 +/- 4%; p less than 0.02) accompanied by a decrease, rather than the predicted increase, in half-life (7.1 +/- 2.7 versus 6.3 +/- 2.1 hours; p less than 0.02). Volumes of distribution remained stable while the mean quinidine clearance tended to increase. Half-life correlated with albumin changes (r = -0.71; p less than 0.02). Apparently, improvement in clinical status (assumed) and drug clearance (measured) negated the direct effects of the decrease in unbound quinidine fraction. Although unbound drug concentrations should correlate best with drug dynamic and kinetic information, full knowledge of the clinical context of such measurements is needed for appropriate interpretation.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the qualitative and quantitative effects of radiofrequency energy using active fixation and passive contact catheter delivery systems on normal bovine atrium and ventricle and diseased human ventricle in vitro. Two active fixation (custom screw-in or suction electrode) catheters and two passive contact (custom ring or standard electrode) catheters were used with a 500 kHz radiofrequency current generator. Linear regression analysis between lesion dimensions and power output showed excellent correlation coefficients for all catheter delivery systems except the suction catheter. Lesion sizes also increased with duration of radiofrequency energy delivery at low power using the USCI quadripolar catheter. Lesion size in diseased human ventricle was considerably smaller than in the normal ventricle. Comparison of induced lesion dimensions using pulsed and continuous delivery modes showed only minor differences. Tissue impedance was relatively constant during energy delivery. Arcing was associated with a sudden increase in voltage and impedance and a sudden decline in current. This was most frequently observed at high power and with the suction electrode catheter. The use of high (50 W) power output and prolonged application (up to 180 seconds) in atrium and ventricle did not induce perforation. We conclude that a variety of catheter delivery systems can be used for effective radiofrequency energy delivery and ablation in atrial and ventricular myocardium in the pulsed or continuous mode. Impedance changes during radiofrequency ablation cannot be used to guide the extent of ablation but do detect arcing during the procedure.\r"

The size of the initially jeopardized myocardium and the salvaged myocardium were quantitated on thallium-201 studies obtained immediately before and 10 days after streptokinase infusion. Exercise-induced ischemia (defined by reversible thallium-201 perfusion defects or stress-induced deterioration of regional wall motion) in the reperfused myocardium was absent in 46% of patients and was present in different degrees in the remaining 54%. A significantly lower proportion of patients, however, showed exercise-induced chest pain and/or ST segment depression (10% and 20%, respectively). By stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, the quantitatively determined size of the salvaged myocardium (398 units versus 65 units, p less than 0.01) and the ratio of the salvaged myocardium/extent of initially jeopardized myocardium (70% versus 28%, p less than 0.01) were both independent predictors of stress-induced ischemia, whereas the extent of initially jeopardized myocardium (585 units versus 407 units, p = NS), incidence of greater than or equal to 99% coronary stenosis (37% versus 46%, p = NS), and ischemic time (160 versus 196 minutes, p = NS) did not provide additional predictive information. We conclude that exercise-induced ischemia, which is frequently present in the streptokinase-reperfused myocardium, cannot be detected accurately by exercise-induced chest pain or ST segment depression, nor can it be predicted by the severity of residual coronary stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To improve early detection of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, studies were performed in patients with long-term doxorubicin treatment using pulsed Doppler echocardiography to assess the changes in left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling dynamics. M-mode echocardiographic systolic parameters and Doppler transmitral flow velocities were analyzed in two groups of patients. In group A (45 patients, mean age 45 +/- 13 years), the results were compared with those of a control group of 35 normal subjects matched for age. In group B (19 patients, mean age 44 +/- 12 years), the pretreatment results were prospectively compared with those obtained during treatment protocol. The patients received a cumulative dosage of 253 +/- 125 mg/m2 of doxorubicin for group A and 240 +/- 135 mg/m2 for group B. After doxorubicin treatment, in the two groups there were no significant changes in LV dimensions, shortening fraction, and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF). In contrast, Doppler echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function were significantly modified after doxorubicin in the two groups:isovolumic relaxation period was prolonged by 32% in group A (p less than 0.001) and by 22% in group B (p less than 0.005).2+ The early peak flow velocity was reduced by 18% in group A (p less 0.002) and by 13% in group B (p less than 0.04), and the ratio early peak flow velocity/atrial peak flow velocity also decreased significantly, by 23% in group A (p less than 0.001) and by 20% in group B (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen of 62 children had infundibular gradients prior to valvuloplasty; five of these disappeared following balloon valvuloplasty. Five other children without pre-valvuloplasty infundibular gradients but with angiographic infundibular narrowing developed new infundibular gradients following valvuloplasty. Propranolol was administered to six children because of severe infundibular constriction, with improvement. None required surgical intervention. At follow-up the infundibular gradients either diminished or disappeared. The infundibular gradients appear to be more frequent with increasing age and severity of pulmonary valvar obstruction. Children developing systemic or suprasystemic right ventricular pressures after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty may be candidates for propranolol therapy. Regression of the infundibular stenosis at follow-up can be expected, as has been observed after surgical pulmonary valvotomy. Because the infundibular obstruction can be successfully managed, balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty remains the treatment of choice for isolated valvar pulmonary stenosis. Use of balloon valvuloplasty in children less than 5 years of age and/or prior to development of pulmonary gradients in excess of 80 mm Hg may reduce the chance for development of infundibular reaction.\r"

All patients were followed for an average of 11 months. During exercise, 81 patients (20%) had abnormal exercise-induced ST-segment depression without chest pain (group 1). Twenty patients (5%) had chest pain without ST changes (group 2). Twenty-one patients (5%) had both exercise-induced chest pain and ST-T-segment depression (group 3) and 268 patients (70%) had a normal exercise test with no chest pain (group 4). The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, history of previous myocardial infarct and previous coronary bypass surgery. Group 4 included more patients with complete revascularization. Mutually exclusive cardiac events were defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, class III angina and additional revascularization (coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass surgery). The cardiac event rate in groups 1, 2 and 3 were significantly higher than in group 4 (40, 45 and 43 vs 22%; p = 0.001). There were 4 cardiac deaths and 4 nonfatal myocardial infarctions in group 1 compared to 2 cardiac deaths and 3 nonfatal myocardial infarctions in group 4 (p = 0.03 and 0.05, respectively). The event rates in groups 1, 2 and 3 patients with multivessel disease were significantly greater than in group 4 (44, 60 and 47 vs 22%; p = 0.002). Thus, exercise-induced myocardial ischemic episodes, both symptomatic and silent, early after coronary angioplasty are predictive of an unfavorable prognosis and serious cardiac events, particularly in patients with multivessel disease and incomplete revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "To gain insight into the altered kinetics of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) release after reperfusion, a physiologically based model with first-order CK-MB appearance and disappearance functions was postulated. This biexponential model is based on the assumption that reperfusion reestablishes nutritive blood flow, providing direct access of interstitial CK-MB to the bloodstream. This is in contrast to persistent coronary artery occlusion, in which no direct access to nutritive flow is present. The accuracy of this model was examined in 8 dogs reperfused after 2 hours of coronary artery occlusion. The fit to observed values was excellent, with a mean r2 of 0.97 +/- 0.05. In agreement with the biexponential model, the initial increase in CK-MB activity was abrupt and rapid. The same degree of accuracy was found in 21 patients with angiographic evidence of reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy (mean r2 0.97 +/- 0.02). The appearance characteristics were similar to the animal model, with an abrupt and rapid increase in CK-MB activity. When compared with 5 patients with persistent occlusion, ka, the rate constant of the appearance function, clearly distinguished patients with reperfusion (chi-square = 20.6, p less than 0.0001), whereas considerable overlap was present in the time to peak CK-MB (time to peak less than 12 hours, chi-square = 3.6, difference not significant). Alterations of CK-MB release in reperfusion can be accurately modeled with the biexponential model. The characteristics of this model suggest that early identification of reperfusion by serial CK-MB assay is possible.\r"

  ".W": "Normal values for the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) at 11 different high-pass filter settings were obtained from 100 normal subjects (group I). The filtered QRS duration and the duration of low amplitude signals less than 40 microV, but not the root mean square voltage of the last 40 ms (RMS40), showed normal distribution. A normal distribution for RMS40 could be obtained by transforming each value to its natural logarithm. The normal values were used in a systematic approach to optimize the accuracy of the SAECG to predict the results of programmed stimulation in 80 patients with spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Fifty-two patients with no inducible VT (group II) and 28 patients with inducible sustained monomorphic VT (group III) were investigated. The 3 SAECG parameters at each high-pass filter in groups II and III were categorized as normal or abnormal and were evaluated singly or in combinations of 2 or 3. There was no combination that provided a sensitivity greater than 82% that could also be obtained by single determinations of low amplitude signals less than 40 microV at 25 to 40 Hz or RMS40 at 40 Hz. On the other hand, there were 267 different combinations that provided a maximal specificity of 98%. The best total predictive accuracy of a single parameter was 85%, provided by RMS40 at 40 or 60 Hz. The total predictive accuracy could be improved to 89% by 1 of 32 different combinations. The top combinations were mostly in triplets and included SAECG parameters recorded at different high-pass filter settings. The only 2 paired combinations with the best total predictive accuracy were RMS40 at 20 or 25 Hz paired with RMS40 at 40 Hz. Frequencies at both ends of the analyzed high-pass filter settings (less than 20 Hz and greater than 60 Hz) were not represented in the top predictive combinations. The SAECG parameters analyzed at 40 Hz were most frequently represented in the top predictive combinations, suggesting that the SAECG may have the best predictive accuracy at this filter setting. In summary, the combination of SAECG parameters analyzed at different filter settings can enhance the accuracy of the technique as a screening test for the results of programmed stimulation in patients with spontaneous nonsustained VT.\r"

  ".W": "Activity-triggered, rate-variable pacing systems offer a wide range of pacemaker patients the benefits of an appropriate paced chronotropic response. However, optimizing settings for these devices often entails treadmill exercise testing. To assess simpler procedures for predicting appropriate settings, pacing rates of \"strapped-on\" and implanted Activitrax pacemakers were evaluated during arm exercise, walk-in-place exercise and treadmill exercise (0% slope at 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mph). For exercise of similar duration, steady-state pacing rates of implanted devices during arm and walk-in-place exercise were lower than those achieved during treadmill exercise. Linear regression analysis resulted in the slope of these relations most closely approaching 1.0 for arm exercise at \"low\" activity threshold, while walk-in-place tended to result in slopes approaching 1.0 at all activity thresholds. Similarly, although strapped-on devices underestimated rates obtained with implanted devices, differences fell within a narrow range (-6 to -14%). Thus, in patients with implanted or strapped-on Activitrax pacemakers, relatively simple exercise procedures suitable for office or clinic environment may be useful to provide an estimate of pacing rates during physical activity, and may thereby facilitate selection of appropriate programmable settings.\r"

The right ventricular effective refractory period increased from 247 +/- 25 to 273 +/- 26 ms with sotalol (p = 0.0001) and the corrected QT interval increased from 431 +/- 35 to 456 +/- 62 ms (p = 0.02). Arrhythmia suppression was defined as no sustained VT or VF in response to programmed cardiac stimulation using up to 3 extrastimuli. Induced VT or VF was suppressed by sotalol therapy in 10 (24%) patients (group 1). Group 1 patients had faster induced arrhythmias at the baseline study than patients whose induced ventricular arrhythmia was not suppressed (group 2). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction tended to be higher in group 1 patients (p = 0.07). Fourteen patients (including 9 group 1 patients) continued receiving sotalol after discharge. In 2 group 2 patients, sotalol was combined with a class IA antiarrhythmic drug. During a mean follow-up period of 7.9 +/- 4.9 months, 2 patients had recurrent VT and in 2 others sotalol was discontinued due to side effects.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine whether late potentials of right and left ventricular origin could be differentiated with the use of a signal-averaging technique. Nineteen patients with both late potentials and recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia were divided into 2 groups according to the origin of their late potentials. Group I consisted of 10 patients with late potentials that originated from the right ventricle. Group II consisted of 9 patients with late potentials originating from the left ventricle. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (Marquette Electronics MAC I unit) were recorded using 3 bipolar and 3 augmented unipolar leads (the electrode positions were V1, V5 and V6R) with a band-pass filter of 100 to 300 Hz. The augmented unipolar V5 lead (aV5) was used for left-side recording and the augmented unipolar V1 lead (aV1) was used for right-side recording. In group I, the mean maximal late potential amplitude was larger in lead aV1 than in lead aV5 (5.1 +/- 2.5 vs 3.7 +/- 1.8 microV, p less than 0.005) and the maximal late potential amplitude was larger in lead aV1 in all except 1 patient. In group II, however, the mean maximal late potential amplitude was smaller in lead aV1 than in lead aV5 (4.0 +/- 3.0 vs 5.7 +/- 3.2 microV, p less than 0.005) and the maximal late potential amplitude was smaller in lead aV1 in all patients. Thus, the origin of late potentials (right ventricular vs left ventricular origin) can be determined by comparing the maximal amplitudes of late potentials in the right- and left-sided leads. This method might be useful in determining ventricular tachycardia origins.\r"

To determine whether patients at higher risk for coronary artery disease can be identified, 40 asymptomatic hypertensive men with LV hypertrophy were prospectively studied using exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy and exercise radionuclide angiography. Endpoints indicative of coronary artery disease were defined as the subsequent development of typical angina pectoris, which occurred in 8 patients during a median follow-up of 38 months, or myocardial infarction, which did not occur. The exercise electrocardiogram was interpreted by standard ST-segment criteria and by a computerized treadmill exercise score. Abnormal ST-segment responses were present in 16 of the 40 hypertensives (40%), whereas the treadmill score was positive in 8 of those same 40 patients (20%). Scintigraphic perfusion defects assessed both visually and semiquantitatively were observed in 8 of 40 (20%) patients. An abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise was present in 40% (16 of 40) of patients, and 3 of 40 (7.5%) developed new wall motion abnormalities during exercise. Six of 8 patients with either perfusion defects or abnormal treadmill score developed typical angina during follow-up. All 5 patients with concordant positive exercise scintigrams and treadmill score developed chest pain during follow-up and had coronary artery disease confirmed by coronary angiography. However, only 7 of 16 (44%) patients with positive ST changes or abnormal ejection fraction responses during exercise developed chest pain during follow-up. In contrast, of 32 patients with negative scintigrams only 2 developed atypical chest pain syndromes, and significant coronary artery disease was excluded by angiography in 1 patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Traditional quantitative coronary arteriographic measurements have largely ignored geometric variables, which may be important in determining the obstructive nature of coronary stenoses. To illustrate the relation between standard quantitative coronary arteriography and calculated transstenotic fluid dynamics, 25 patients with 1-vessel disease referred for coronary angioplasty were analyzed. Minimal lumen diameter and percent stenosis were measured and the values compared with calculations of pressure loss that used standard hydraulic formulas encompassing both frictional and separation components within the stenotic segments. Baseline flow velocity was assumed to equal 4 cm/s and normal hyperemic flow response was presumed to equal 5 times that of baseline. Fluid dynamic estimates suggested that initial translesional pressure gradients would develop at a minimal diameter of 0.6 mm (80% diameter), with an exponentially severe pressure differential beyond a minimal coronary diameter of 0.3 mm (92% diameter). Maximal velocities were calculated based upon an assumed normal hyperemic flow response of 5 times that of baseline, with the demonstration of early impairment of hyperemic flow reserve at minimal diameters of 1.2 mm (46% diameter). Furthermore, hyperemic flow reserve was completely abolished at a minimal diameter of 0.3 to 0.5 mm (89 to 92% diameter). Beyond a minimal diameter of 0.2 mm (93% diameter), resting hypoperfusion was anticipated with flow velocities below the initially assumed value (4 cm/s). Thus, it is feasible to estimate transstenotic pressure losses and maximal coronary flow velocity by applying Newtonian fluid dynamic equations to actual angiographic stenoses in man. These calculations generally correlate with traditional quantitative arteriographic estimates of stenosis severity, although other geometric parameters such as lesion length, \"exit angle\" and blood viscosity may alter transstenotic hemodynamics.\r"

To assess the individual effects of the LV filling pressure and mitral regurgitation, 33 normal subjects, 14 patients with cardiomyopathy and normal LV filling pressures (measured as mean pulmonary capillary pressure) and 26 patients with elevated LV filling pressures (greater than 15 mm Hg) were studied with transmitral spectral tracings derived from pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Both cardiomyopathy groups demonstrated similarly dilated left ventricles with reduced systolic dysfunction. Patients with cardiomyopathy and normal LV filling pressures had prolonged isovolumic relaxation periods and a reduced ratio of the rapid filling to atrial filling integrals. Patients with cardiomyopathy and elevated LV pressures demonstrated an increased peak rapid filling velocity (97 +/- 21 cm/s) and rapid filling fraction (74.8 +/- 16.2%) compared with normal subjects (80 +/- 16 cm/s, p less than 0.01; 62.4 +/- 12.5%, p less than 0.05) and patients with cardiomyopathy and normal LV filling pressures (81 +/- 27 cm/s, p less than 0.05; 59.3 +/- 8.8%, p less than 0.05). Conversely, the atrial filling fraction was decreased in the cardiomyopathy group with elevated LV filling pressures compared with normal subjects and patients with cardiomyopathy and normal LV filling pressures. Mitral regurgitation increased the peak rapid filling velocity in both cardiomyopathy groups without altering the distribution of diastolic filling. In conclusion, elevated LV filling pressures appear to affect the distribution of diastolic filling, whereas mitral regurgitation affects the peak rate of rapid filling.\r"

  ".W": "A new noninvasive method using pulsed Doppler echocardiography was developed to assess left ventricular (LV) posterior wall motion dynamics. Seventeen normal subjects and 23 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization were prospectively studied. The sample volume was placed within the LV posterior wall endocardium just apical to the mitral valve sulcus using a posteriorly angulated low parasternal view. The wall filter was set at 100 Hz to record the low velocities of the LV posterior wall motion. The Doppler signal was morphologically similar to the rate of change of the LV posterior wall endocardium excursion obtained by a digitized M-mode echocardiogram, and showed 3 major waves: a systolic wave (S), an early diastolic wave (E) and a late diastolic wave (A). The peak velocities of LV posterior wall endocardium excursion were also determined by M-mode echocardiographic technique. We found a significant linear correlation between peak E-wave velocity and M-mode peak diastolic endocardial velocity (r = 0.90, p less than 0.001) and between peak S-wave velocity and M-mode peak systolic endocardial velocity (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001). M-mode peak systolic endocardial velocity showed an important overlap between control subjects and patients with normal and patients with abnormal LV posterior wall motion on the angiogram. In contrast, peak S-wave velocity was a better discriminator, and a peak S-wave velocity less than 7.5 cm/s was associated with abnormal LV posterior wall motion with an 83% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 95% accuracy. In patients with coronary artery disease but normal systolic LV posterior wall motion and normal global systolic LV function, peak S-wave velocity was not different when compared to control subjects. Peak E-wave velocity and E/A were significantly lower than in control subjects (p less than 0.01) and peak A-wave velocity was greater (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, these data suggest that pulsed Doppler echocardiography can be used for the direct analysis of LV posterior wall instantaneous low velocities and appears to be more informative than M-mode technique for systolic measurements. Thus, detection of abnormal LV posterior wall diastolic motion by pulsed Doppler echocardiography may, upon additional confirmation, be used as a new noninvasive method to gain insight into global LV diastolic performance.\r"

Simultaneous recordings were obtained with Oxford Medilog 4000-II and Medilog MR-35 systems from the same 2 bipolar leads. Each potential ischemic episode was interpreted blindly by 2 investigators. Significant ST depression was strictly defined as greater than or equal to 1 mm of horizontal or down-sloping ST depression persisting for 0.06 second beyond the J point and lasting greater than or equal to 1 minute. Of 82 episodes reviewed, 63 (77%) were either positive (37) or negative (26) for ischemia by both systems. However, 17 episodes were interpreted as positive on AM tracings but negative on FM tracings; the converse was true for only 2 episodes (p less than 0.01). For episodes read as positive with both systems, there were close correlations between recorders for duration (r = 0.80) and magnitude (r = 0.90) of ST depression. Because of the greater number of positive AM events, however, the mean total duration of ST depression for patients with ischemia during daily activities was greater on AM than on FM recordings (74 +/- 77 vs 39 +/- 42 minutes, p less than 0.10). Discrepancies between AM and FM tracings were invariably due to small differences in ST-segment morphology or in the magnitude of ST-segment depression. In summary, AM monitors generate complexes similar in appearance to those produced by FM devices in most instances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89300578\r", 
  ".W": "A noninvasive method using Doppler echocardiography was developed to determine the force exerted by the left ventricle in accelerating the blood into the aorta. The value of this new Doppler ejection index in the assessment of left ventricular (LV) performance was tested in 36 patients with chronic congestive heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization and in 11 age-matched normal control subjects. The 36 patients were subgrouped into 3 groups based on angiographic ejection fraction (LV ejection fraction greater than 60, 41 to 60 and less than or equal to 40%). According to Newton's second law of motion (force = mass X acceleration), the LV ejection force was derived from the product of the mass of blood ejected during the acceleration time with the mean acceleration undergone during that time. In patients with LV ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%, LV ejection force, peak aortic velocity and mean acceleration were severely depressed when compared with the other groups (p less than 0.001). In patients with LV ejection fraction of 41 to 60%, LV ejection force was significantly reduced (22 +/- 3 kdynes) when compared with normal subjects (29 +/- 5 kdynes, p = 0.002) and with patients with LV ejection fraction greater than 60% (29 +/- 7 kdynes, p = 0.009); peak velocity and mean acceleration did not differ between these 3 groups. The LV ejection force showed a good linear correlation with LV ejection fraction (r = 0.86) and a better power fit (r = 0.91). Peak aortic blood velocity and mean acceleration showed less good linear correlations with LV ejection fraction (r = 0.73 and r = 0.66, respectively). The mass of blood ejected during the acceleration time also showed a weak linear correlation with LV ejection fraction (r = 0.64). An LV ejection force less than 20 kdynes was associated with a depressed LV performance (LV ejection fraction less than 50%) with 91% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Thus, these findings suggest that LV ejection force is a new Doppler ejection phase index that appears to be more accurate than peak aortic blood velocity and mean acceleration for the assessment of systolic LV function.\r"

  ".W": "Several techniques exist for the quantification of absolute coronary artery diameters using radiologic methods. An in vivo assessment of a quantitative technique based on direct digitally acquired images was performed by imaging inflated angioplasty balloons (n = 25), balloon catheter shafts (n = 16) and coronary guidewires (n = 20) at the time of coronary angioplasty. After this, the actual size of the objects was determined with a micrometer. Diameters measured by the quantitative digital method had an excellent correlation with the actual diameters (digital diameter = 0.80 [actual diameter] + 0.32; n = 61; r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate = 0.26 mm; p less than 0.001). Moreover, the correlation between interobserver and intraobserver measurements was excellent (r = 0.99 for both, standard error of the estimate = 0.16 mm and 0.09 mm, respectively). However, there was a consistent error present that was related to the size of the object measured. Objects less than 0.5 mm were consistently overestimated and objects greater than 1 mm were usually underestimated by the digital technique, although the actual magnitude of the error was small. Objects less than 0.5 mm in diameter were overestimated by 0.41 +/- 0.11 mm and objects greater than 1 mm were underestimated by 0.23 +/- 0.19 mm. Based on an analysis of the error present, correction algorithms were formulated and tested prospectively using an additional 29 object measurements. This resulted in an improvement in the quantification of the diameters with a smaller magnitude of error. This in vivo assessment suggests that the rapid online assessment of absolute coronary artery diameters is possible, but also demonstrates important errors inherent in this method.\r"

Clinical and electrocardiographic parameters as well as results of exercise testing and 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring were assessed at presentation and after a mean follow-up of 6.3 years (range 3 to 9). Mean number of anginal episodes and nitroglycerin consumption per week were similar at presentation and at the last follow-up. Furthermore, no significant difference was noted in heart rate-systolic blood pressure product at 0.1 mV of ST-segment depression (20,363 +/- 5,747 vs 21,649 +/- 5,687 beats/min x mm Hg), at angina (19,223 +/- 5,680 vs 20,126 +/- 6,023 beats/min x mm Hg) and at peak exercise (22,057 +/- 5,669 vs 22,868 +/- 6,122 beats/min x mm Hg). Time to 0.1 mV of ST-segment depression, to angina and to peak exercise was also similar (595 +/- 163 vs 631 +/- 184 s, 524 +/- 156 vs 571 +/- 168 s and 671 +/- 168 vs 718 +/- 186 s, respectively). The number of episodes of ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV during electrocardiographic monitoring was similar at presentation and follow-up (31 vs 25) as was the proportion of painful episodes (39 vs 36%).

  ".W": "The results of 127 left main (LM) coronary angioplasties were reviewed to assess short- and long-term effectiveness. Three major subgroups were considered: (1) elective \"protected\" (defined as the presence of a patent bypass graft to the left coronary circulation) patients (n = 84); (2) elective \"unprotected\" patients (n = 33); and (3) acute patients, in whom LM coronary angioplasty was performed in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction (n = 10). Successful LM dilation was achieved in 94% of elective patients and 90% of acute patients. Procedural mortality was 4.3% in elective patients (2.4 and 9.1% in protected and unprotected patients, respectively, p = 0.14) and 50% in the acute subgroup. Long-term follow-up data, available for 98% of patients, revealed actuarial 3-year survival rates of 90 and 36% in elective protected and unprotected subgroups, respectively (p less than 0.0005). In the acute subgroup, 3 patients (30%) were alive at the time of follow-up; all had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery. Thus, although elective angioplasty of an unprotected LM coronary artery is technically feasible, the long-term prognosis of such patients is very poor. LM angioplasty in this subgroup should be reserved for patients in whom surgical revascularization is not an option. In contrast, elective angioplasty of a protected LM coronary artery can be accomplished safely with good long-term results. LM coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction can be effective as a salvage procedure; however, adjunctive coronary bypass surgery is important for long-term survival.\r"

This study was done to assess the influence of residual anterograde coronary perfusion on long-term morbidity and mortality in patients after AMI. Over a 10-year period, 179 subjects (132 men, 47 women, aged 25 to 66 years) with infarction and angiographic evidence of disease of only 1 coronary artery were followed for 47 +/- 29 (mean +/- standard deviation) months. All were receiving medical therapy. Sixty-four patients had partial or complete anterograde perfusion of the infarct artery (group I), whereas the other 115 had no or minimal anterograde perfusion (group II). The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, duration of follow-up, maintenance medications and left ventricular function. In group I, unstable angina and congestive heart failure each occurred in less than or equal to 10%, and none died. In marked contrast, the 115 patients in group II frequently had unstable angina (25%) and congestive heart failure (17%) (p less than or equal to 0.05 for both vs group I), and 21 (18%) died suddenly (p less than 0.001 vs group I). Thus, the incidence of long-term morbidity and mortality is greatly increased after AMI in patients without residual anterograde perfusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. In these patients, the restoration of partial or complete anterograde flow--pharmacologically or mechanically--may be beneficial even if it is accomplished hours to days after the acute event.\r"

Forty-four patients (58%) had unstable angina and 33 (42%) had an acute myocardial infarction. One death occurred within 24 hours of testing. Sixty-eight patients were followed for an average of 12 months; 25, 31 and 23% had a fixed, reversible or combined thallium defect on their predischarge thallium scan. During follow-up, 10 patients died or had a nonfatal myocardial infarction; in each case, a reversible or combined myocardial thallium defect was present. Univariate analysis of 17 clinical, scintigraphic and angiographic variables showed that a reversible thallium defect and the angiographically determined extent of coronary artery disease were predictors of future cardiac events. The extent of coronary disease and global left ventricular ejection fraction were predictors of subsequent reinfarction or death. Logistic regression analyses revealed that a reversible thallium defect (p less than 0.001) and the extent of coronary disease (p less than 0.009) were the only significant predictors of a cardiac event. When death or reinfarction were the outcome variables, the extent of coronary disease (p less than 0.02) and left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.06) were the only variables selected. Thus, intravenous dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy after an acute coronary ischemic syndrome is a useful and relatively safe noninvasive test to predict subsequent cardiac events.\r"

On the first day of AMI, 80 MBq of indium-111 antimyosin was injected and planar images were made 24 hours later. Indium-111 antimyosin uptake was evaluated for count density index (count density of infarct zone/left lung count density) in the left anterior oblique projection, in which the infarction zone was well displayed in all patients. Using 2-dimensional echocardiography, the left ventricle was divided into 13 segments and evaluated for regional asynergy, which was considered severe (akinesia or dyskinesia) or mild (hypokinesia). The extent of regional asynergy was measured by the number of asynergic segments. All 21 patients had severe regional asynergy on admission. Nine of 21 showed only mild regional asynergy on discharge and 12 of 21 had persistent severe regional asynergy in at least 1 segment. The count density index was significantly lower in patients with mild regional asynergy on discharge compared with patients with severe regional asynergy (1.63 +/- 0.27 vs 2.50 +/- 0.42, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Monitoring facilities were established in the NMR imaging suite that provided the same level of reliability and safety found in a standard coronary care unit. An imaging protocol was developed that allowed the acquisition of a complete study in 30 minutes while providing useful information about mechanical function and myocardial tissue contrast. Eighteen postthrombolysis patients were imaged within 21 +/- 2 hours of chest pain onset. No patient developed recurrent chest pain or arrhythmias in the NMR imaging suite. Relatively T2-weighted spin-echo images (echo time = 60 ms; repetition time = heart rate) provided interpretable images in 16 patients. Fourteen normal subjects were imaged for comparison. Thirteen of 16 patients had an increase in signal intensity in the region of the infarction. Regional wall thickening was assessed using a floating endocardial centroid technique. Wall motion abnormalities detected by NMR corresponded to those noted by 2-dimensional echocardiography and contrast angiography. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the detection of infarction were 93, 80 and 87%, respectively, when signal intensity and wall thickening abnormalities were combined. In summary, NMR imaging is feasible in patients with acute myocardial infarction within 24 hours of chest pain onset. The study can be conducted safely and it provides useful information about acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Myocardial FFA extraction decreased significantly from 22.8 +/- 3.1% at rest to 7.7 +/- 1.5% at peak exercise (p less than 0.05). Myocardial lactate extraction showed no significant change between rest and peak exercise. After control exercise testing, 8 subjects were given a single oral dose of nilvadipine (6 mg) and then again underwent exercise testing for the same duration. Nilvadipine lessened or abolished chest pain and there was less depression of the ST segment at peak exercise. Furthermore, myocardial FFA extraction showed no significant change between rest and peak exercise after nilvadipine administration. These results suggest that myocardial FFA extraction can be used to assess the presence of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia at an earlier stage than myocardial lactate extraction.\r"

Their mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 53 +/- 11 years, 83% were men, 75% had coronary artery disease, 76% presented with cardiac arrest and 28% had concomitant cardiac surgery. The mean ejection fraction of these patients was 0.41 +/- 0.15. At follow-up, 29 patients (62%) had resumed work at 11 +/- 9 weeks after implantation. Those who returned to work were better educated (15 vs 11 years, p less than 0.001) and less likely to have a history of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences between patients who returned to work and those who did not in terms of age, sex, race, functional class, ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease, reason for ACD, or concomitant surgery. Multivariate analysis revealed that level of education was the single best predictor of reemployment status. The only other factors found to add significant predictive power in a stepwise analysis were extent of coronary artery disease and marital status. The model using these 3 variables had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 72%. It was concluded that (1) most patients employed before ACD implantation are able to return to work after the procedure, and (2) nonmedical factors play an important role in the resumption of work-related activities. These findings have important quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness implications for ACD implantees.\r"

Thirty patients, ages 12 to 19 years, operated on before 5 years of age for complete repair of TF (n = 13), VSD (n = 7) or ASD (n = 10) and 10 age-matched control subjects underwent a progressive maximal cycling test to determine the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), and completed submaximal cycling at intensities of 33 and 66% VO2 max, respectively, to determine the cardiac output (CO2-rebreathing). No significant differences in VO2 max were observed (TF = 37.6 +/- 10; VDS = 34.0 +/- 9.2; ASD = 36.5 +/- 7; controls = 41.3 +/- 6.0 ml/kg/min).

LV mass index was determined by echocardiography in 78 patients who had been treated by dialysis for at least 3 months. A significant relation was evident between anemia and LV hypertrophy. The mean LV mass index was 158 +/- 6 g/m2 (mean +/- standard error) in patients in the lowest quartile of serum hemoglobin and 140 +/- 10, 132 +/- 7 and 120 +/- 8 g/m2 in the second, third and uppermost quartiles, respectively (p = 0.005). This relation persisted after adjusting for systolic blood pressure, treatment mode and suspected coronary artery disease. Forty-eight patients had paired studies. In these, LV mass index increased as hemoglobin decreased (coefficient = -0.81 g/m2/g/liter, p less than 0.025). These data indicate that anemia contributes to the development of LV hypertrophy in patients with end-stage renal disease.\r"

Elevated serum levels of TNF were found in 15 (79%) of 19 patients with progressive encephalopathy (PE), compared with 1 (8%) of 12 patients without neurologic involvement. There was a significant association of PE with elevated serum TNF levels. Conversely, of 16 patients with elevated serum TNF levels, 15 (94%) were found to have PE, and of 8 patients with serum TNF levels greater than 100 pg/ml, all 8 (100%) had PE. No association was found between cerebrospinal fluid levels of TNF and PE. Neither serum nor cerebrospinal fluid TNF levels correlated with the degree of cachexia. These data suggest that circulating TNF may be responsible for the myelin damage that occurs in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-associated PE.\r"

It is characterized by suppuration of large muscle groups that can, if not quickly and appropriately treated, lead to sepsis and death. Diagnosis can be difficult secondary to the atypical appearance of the abscess process early on. Almost all cases have occurred in otherwise healthy people. The simultaneous occurrence of pyomyositis and immunodeficiency is rare. A recent report of a case in an adult with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is not, however, unexpected. We describe the first documented occurrence of pyomyositis in a child with AIDS. A brief review of the topic is included. Pyomyositis should be included in the list of unusual infections that can occur in children with AIDS.\r"

Of mothers and newborns, respectively, 19.2% and 15.3% of all admissions during this period were screened; 68.2% and 63.1% of urine samples submitted were positive for any drug; 38.8% and 21.1% of screens were positive for more than one drug; and 45.8% and 41.6% were positive for cocaine. In mother-newborn pairs (N = 191) where urine samples were submitted within 4 days of each other, an 84% concordance was shown for cocaine and 67% for methadone, but concordance was much less for other drugs (less than 21%). These results indicate that cocaine was the most common drug detectable in the peripartum period and that both mothers and newborns should be tested to confirm the suspicion of drug effect or withdrawal in the newborn.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, case-referent survey. SETTING: General pediatric clinic at a military base in Ohio. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty children with symptomatic pharyngitis and 150 controls matched for age and time of presentation over a 20-month study period. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS: Anaerobic culture technique was used to improve isolation of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected significantly more often among the ill children than among the controls (39% vs 16%, respectively). In contrast, non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated in similar frequency from the ill and control children (17% vs 21%, respectively). Non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci from groups B, C, F, and G were each isolated in similar frequency among the ill and control children. The isolation rate of non-group A organisms increased with age among both patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci seemed not to be an important cause of sporadic pharyngitis in this pediatric population.\r"

In Hartford County, where the case finding was most complete, 16 children were identified with disease onset during the 7-month cluster period (incidence, 1.7 cases per 10,000 children per year) compared with only 3 children with disease onset during the preceding 7 months. The incidence in Hartford County was higher among urban (4.8/10,000) and Hispanic (8.6/10,000) children and children in lower socioeconomic groups (6.9/10,000) than among suburban children or children in higher socioeconomic or different racial groups (0.9 to 1.1 per 10,000). We performed a case-control study involving 14 of the 16 case children from Hartford County, 10 case children from nearby areas, and 47 control children matched to the case children by age and race. Case children were more likely than control children to have had a sore throat during the month before the onset of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (52% vs 22%; odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 13). This difference and other smaller differences between case and control children suggest that the cluster may have been caused by person-to-person spread of an infectious agent of the respiratory tract to susceptible hosts. To our knowledge this is the first report of a cluster of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and it provides clues for a better understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of the disease.\r"

While 97.0% of the mothers breast-fed their last infant born in Indochina, only 26.1% and 22.4%, respectively, breast-fed their first and last infant born in the United States. Furthermore, only 3.8% of the mothers who were pregnant at the time of the study intended to breast-feed. The duration of breast-feeding decreased from an average of 20.4 months for the last infant born in Indochina to 8.7 months for the last infant born in the United States. After controlling for several sociodemographic variables, only formula samples distributed at hospital discharge had a significant association with formula feeding (odds ratio, 2.02). However, data on intention to breast-feed suggested that a clear cause-and-effect relationship may not exist. Factors related to cultural traditions and acculturation are offered as possible explanations for the decline in breast-feeding. Breast-feeding education for mothers and training for health professionals is recommended.\r"

The Primary Care Clinic scored higher on a primary care index, a measure of the extent to which the facility serves as a primary care source for patients, suggesting that hospital-based training can provide residents with an opportunity to provide primary care.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the relative contribution of sudden death as a cause of late inpatient mortality in newborns after prolonged mechanical ventilation, we reviewed the charts of 348 patients who received ventilation assistance and who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit during a 26-month period. The overall mortality rate for these patients was 25%, with 88% (77/88) of these deaths occurring within 30 days of birth. Eleven infants died after more than 60 days of mechanical ventilation. Seven of these late deaths were sudden, unexpected in-hospital deaths. Sudden deaths occurred at a mean (uncorrected) age of 12 months (range, 4 to 27 months), during periods when infants appeared to be stable or clinically improving, were unrelated to recent respiratory exacerbations, and occurred despite prompt resuscitative efforts. Four infants still required mechanical ventilation, and 4 had tracheostomies at the time of death. All of the infants had chronic hypercarbia (greater than 50 mm Hg) and an elevated serum bicarbonate level (greater than 30 mmol/L), but not hyponatremia, hypochloremia (less than 80 mmol/L), or alkalemia. Left and right ventricular hypertrophy, multiple drug therapy, recurrent cyanotic episodes, and frequent unexplained fevers were common. In comparison with 17 bronchopulmonary dysplasia survivors who required longer than 60 days of ventilation therapy, the late deaths group more frequently had left ventricular hypertrophy and received prolonged combination theophylline anhydrous and beta-adrenergic agonist therapy. We report that sudden death can occur in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia despite in-hospital cardiopulmonary monitoring and the rapid institution of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and is a significant cause of late mortality in infants who receive ventilation therapy for longer than 2 months.\r"
