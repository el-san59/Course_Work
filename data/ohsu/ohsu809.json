  ".W": "Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was measured in samples of liver tissue from a group of alcoholic and non-alcoholic subjects to determine whether decreased liver alcohol dehydrogenase activity is a consequence of ethanol consumption or liver damage. The alcoholic patients were classified further into the following groups: control subjects with no liver disease (group 1), subjects with non-cirrhotic liver disease (group 2), and subjects with cirrhotic liver disease (group 3). The non-alcoholic subjects were also divided, using the same criteria, into groups 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The analysis of the results showed no significant differences when mean alcohol dehydrogenase activities of alcoholic and non-alcoholic patients with similar degrees of liver pathology were compared (groups 1 v 4, 2 v 5, and 3 v 6. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was, however, severely reduced in patients with liver disease compared with control subjects. Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption does not modify hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase activity. The reduction in specific alcohol dehydrogenase activity in alcoholic liver disease is a consequence of liver damage.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the differentiated pattern of efferent sympathetic nerve activity by means of analyzing norepinephrine kinetics in response to sodium restriction, cardiorenal sympathetic activity during rest and mental stress was studied in 12 subjects (33.3 +/- 2.6 years old, SEM) exposed to a low and a normal sodium diet; 5-40 mmol and 160-200 mmol/24 hours, respectively (crossover design). Organ norepinephrine release was calculated from organ plasma flow, arteriovenous plasma concentration gradient across the organ and the organ's fractional extraction of radiolabeled norepinephrine. Body weight and urinary sodium/24 hr fell significantly and urinary potassium/24 hr and both supine and standing blood pressure remained unchanged. Total norepinephrine release to plasma and norepinephrine plasma clearance were similar in both phases (approximately 460 ng/min and 1.90 l/min, respectively). A 138% increase in renal norepinephrine overflow was observed during sodium restriction (from 112 to 267 ng/min, p less than 0.025), which was due to elevated renal vein norepinephrine (434 versus 290 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) because renal plasma flow and renal norepinephrine extraction were unaltered. Similarly, sodium restriction caused a 168% elevation of renal renin secretion (p less than 0.05). Resting cardiac norepinephrine spillover and cardiac norepinephrine reuptake were unchanged between the two salt phases. Total and cardiac norepinephrine release, supine blood pressure, and heart rate increased to about the same extent in response to mental testing regardless of salt phase. In conclusion, sodium restriction induced a differential and physiological increase in resting renal sympathetic nervous activity, leaving cardiac norepinephrine overflow unchanged. Cardiac norepinephrine uptake was normal, which further supports the concept of a true increase of efferent renal nerve activity.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the effect of acute hypertensive episodes on the renal sympathetic baroreceptor reflex in conscious rabbits and the role played by cardiac afferents and endogenous opiate mechanisms. Renal sympathetic nerve activity was recorded during brief perivascular balloon-induced ramp changes in mean arterial pressure before and during 40-minute elevations in resting pressure. Methoxamine infusion was adjusted to increase pressure by +30 and +45 mm Hg in the presence of autonomic blockade of the heart with atenolol and methscopolamine. Experiments were repeated in other rabbits after blocking cardiac afferents with 5% intrapericardial procaine or during intravenous naloxone (4-6 mg/kg, then 0.12 mg/kg/min). We found a progressively severe attenuation of the renal sympathetic baroreceptor reflex during increasing elevations in resting pressure. The upper plateau and range of the reflex curve were both reduced by one third and two thirds during moderate and severe hypertension, respectively. The average gain fell by 64% and 87%, and the range-independent gain and hypotensive reversal response were also reduced. There was no resetting of the reflex to higher pressures as would be expected. One third of the reflex inhibition was prevented by blocking cardiac afferents; none of it was affected by intravenous naloxone, which had previously been shown to reverse the renal baroreceptor reflex depression elicited by hemorrhagic hypotension. Factors possibly responsible for the remaining two thirds of the hypertension-induced sympathoinhibition are suggested to be either central depression of sympathetic tone after elevation of arterial baroreceptor discharge during the hypertensive episode or additional inhibitory afferent input arising from the pulmonary circulation.\r"

We hypothesized that the white coat phenomenon was due to greater blood pressure reactivity to the stress of a clinic visit and that, as a consequence, white coat hypertensive patients would display greater blood pressure reactivity to exercise and mental stress, as well as increased emotional reactivity and higher levels of anger, anxiety, or depression. We studied 89 patients with essential hypertension between 29 and 59 years old with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, treadmill exercise testing with oxygen consumption measurement, mental stress testing (including mental arithmetic, public speaking, and video game tasks), and psychological testing (State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, emotional reactivity scale). We defined white coat hypertension as a mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 135 mm Hg or less and diastolic 85 mm Hg or less and persistent hypertension as a mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more or diastolic 90 mm Hg or more. Forty-nine patients were classified as persistent hypertensives and 20 as white coat hypertensives. No significant differences were seen in demographic or clinical characteristics, fitness level, blood pressure response to exercise or mental stress, or psychological characteristics, except that white coat hypertensive patients had lower systolic blood pressures in the clinic and during exercise and greater variability of clinic diastolic blood pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We compared the pattern of secretion of angiotensinogen with that of endogenous adrenocorticotropin hormone, which is secreted by AtT-20 cells through the regulated pathway. When cells were incubated for 5 hours with dibutyryladenosine cyclic monophosphate or KCl, adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion was significantly higher than control, whereas monensin had no effect. In contrast, angiotensinogen secretion was markedly reduced by monensin, but no stimulation was observed with dibutyryladenosine cyclic monophosphate or KCl. These results make it unlikely that angiotensinogen could be cotargeted with active renin in the dense core granules of the regulated pathway. Alternative mechanisms must explain how angiotensin II is synthesized locally by tissue renin-angiotensin systems.\r"

Because hypertension has been well documented as one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis, we explored the possibility that hypertension accelerates atherogenesis by increasing the turnover of endothelial cells and hence the transendothelial macromolecular permeability. The investigations were performed on thoracic aortas of 10 male 3-4-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats and eight male age-matched Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats. In en face preparations of aortic specimens, mitotic endothelial cells were identified by hematoxylin nuclear staining; dying or dead endothelial cells containing cytoplasmic immunoglobulin G were detected by indirect immunoperoxidase technique; and endothelial leakage to Evans blue-albumin conjugate was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The number of leaky foci per unit endothelial surface area in spontaneously hypertensive rats was found to be approximately three times that in Wistar-Kyoto control rats; the frequencies of both endothelial cell mitosis and death in spontaneously hypertensive rats were also approximately three times the corresponding values in Wistar-Kyoto rats. These findings indicate that hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats is accompanied by increased endothelial cell turnover and an attendant enhancement of permeability to macromolecules.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the mechanism of the vasodilator effect of H2O2 on cerebral arterioles and its effect on endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine. Topical application of H2O2 (0.1-1 microM) on the brain surface of anesthetized cats equipped with cranial windows induced dose-dependent arteriolar dilation, which was markedly inhibited by topical deferoxamine, showing that it was probably mediated by generation of hydroxyl radical. Higher concentrations of H2O2 (3 microM) also induced dilation, which was unaffected by deferoxamine, indicating the participation of other mechanisms. After topical application of H2O2, endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine were eliminated or converted to vasoconstriction, and in bioassay experiments, acetylcholine-mediated endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) was absent. Superoxide dismutase plus catalase restored the appearance of transferable EDRF after 1 microM H2O2 but not after 3 microM H2O2. Application of H2O2 in the assay window eliminated the responses to nitroprusside and nitric oxide but did not affect responses to adenosine, to EDRF from the donor window, or responses to S-nitroso-L-cysteine. The inhibiting effect of H2O2 on the response to nitroprusside was partially eliminated after topical application of N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The results show that H2O2 inhibits the vasodilator action of nitroprusside and nitric oxide probably because it oxidizes thiols in vascular smooth muscle and prevents the formation of a nitrosothiol. EDRF from acetylcholine and S-nitroso-L-cysteine still produce dilation in the presence of the blockade induced by H2O2. The findings suggest strongly that the EDRF from acetylcholine in cerebral vessels is a nitrosothiol like S-nitroso-L-cysteine.\r"

  ".W": "In conduit arteries, nitric oxide is formed from L-arginine in the endothelium and released after stimulation with acetylcholine. The contribution of the L-arginine pathway and the effects of age and hypertension on endothelium-dependent vascular regulation were studied, using a video dimension analyzer, in pressurized and perfused mesenteric resistance arteries of 8- and 16-20-week-old Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine caused contractions, which were similarly augmented after removal of the endothelium. NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide formation, augmented the contraction, but less than endothelial removal. Acetylcholine caused endothelium-dependent relaxations that were much more pronounced with intraluminal than with extraluminal application. NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine, methylene blue, and hemoglobin only partially inhibited the response. With aging, the endothelium-dependent inhibition of the response to norepinephrine decreased in Wistar-Kyoto rats; in spontaneously hypertensive rats this inhibition was smaller as compared with age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats. In Wistar-Kyoto rats, the difference between intraluminal and extraluminal activation became more pronounced in adult rats. In the adult but not the young spontaneously hypertensive rats, the response to intraluminal but not extraluminal acetylcholine was reduced as compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats. Thus, in mesenteric resistance arteries of the rat, nitric oxide is released from L-arginine under basal conditions and after stimulation with acetylcholine but only in part accounts for endothelium-dependent responses. With aging and hypertension, the inhibitory effects of the endothelium against norepinephrine-induced contractions decrease. In hypertension, the intraluminal but not extraluminal activation of the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors is impaired.\r"

  ".W": "To gain insight into the membrane alteration that could account for the hyperresponsiveness of platelets in hypertension, we have investigated whether, in resting platelets of hypertensive rats, the metabolism of phospholipids was modified. Because preliminary results indicated a specific acceleration of phosphatidylcholine turnover in spontaneously hypertensive rats, the possible relation between such an abnormality and hypertension was investigated by studying phosphorus-32 labeling of phosphatidylcholine (taken as an index of its turnover) in various experimental models of hypertension. The data showed that phosphatidylcholine turnover 1) was considerably increased in platelets from spontaneously hypertensive (even at the prehypertensive stage) and stroke-prone rats compared with Wistar or Wistar-Kyoto control rats, 2) did not differ between deoxycorticosterone-salt-treated hypertensive and control rats, and 3) was increased in Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high NaCl diet (hence hypertensive rats), compared with either the rats fed a low NaCl diet or the salt-resistant rats. These results indicate that an increase in phosphatidylcholine turnover is a consequence of neither hypertension nor high salt intake and appears likely to be of genetic origin. These data allow us to suggest the existence, in platelets, of a relation between phosphatidylcholine turnover, free cytoplasmic Ca2+, and responsiveness to stimuli. Because phosphatidylcholine is assumed to participate in signal transduction, an increase in its turnover in platelets might be considered as a primary membrane abnormality that, in primary hypertension, results in platelet hyperresponsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Standard peritoneal ultrafiltration characteristics in 18 patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) were investigated in a total of 21 single dwell studies of 6 h duration with 2 L of 3.86% glucose dialysis fluid. Intraperitoneal dialysate volumes were determined using radioiodinated serum albumin (RISA). Calculations were based on a novel mathematical method in which RISA elimination from the peritoneal cavity was taken into account. The RISA elimination rate, KE, was calculated as 2.1 +/- 0.5 ml/min. The true dialysate volume after 360 min (2957 +/- 196 ml) was on the average 28% lower than the volume (3737 +/- 260 ml) calculated without correction for the elimination of RISA. The mean maximum true volume plus sampling losses was 3255 ml at 240 min corresponding to a mean ultrafiltration of 762 ml between 3 min and 240 min. Our method of peritoneal volume determination proved to be useful for clinical investigations. The present study demonstrates that CAPD patients, without any major ultrafiltration problems, exhibit relatively small interpatient variations in their peritoneal volume over time curve.\r"

We chose to compare ordinary cellulose Cuprophan membranes and membranes coated with collagen or fibronectin. Striking differences between uncoated cellulose and fibronectin or collagen coating were seen in the cell count per square millimeter and adhesion behaviour. On the investigated uncoated Cuprophan the hepatocytes were found to attach but not to spread whilst on collagen coated Cuprophan most of the cells spread spherically, and on fibronectin coated membranes most of the cells flattened spherically or polygonally. Time-lapse video microscopy seems to be a valuable technique for assessing the morphologic behaviour of cells in a detailed and quantitative manner in order to improve the hepatocyte culture technique in bioreactors for hybrid systems.\r"

We studied 31 patients (19 M and 12 F) with acute hepatic failure and used different detoxification techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hemofiltration and plasmaferesis. We evaluated blood tests, degree of coma and serum levels of middle-molecular weight substances (by gel-chromatography) for each patient. Our results show that there was an improvement of consciousness and general clinical state in 40% of patients who underwent HD, in 50% of patients treated with HP, in 37.5% of those treated with PF and 78% of patients treated with HF. Unfortunately, the improvement did not last long. In conclusion we can say that artificial support improves hepatic coma and state of consciousness. This improvement could be due to the better regeneration possibilities of hepatic cells. For this reason hemodetoxification treatment should be started as soon as possible.\r"

Treatment of outdated red blood cells (RBCs) with chloroform and/or by pasteurization were evaluated for technical ease, speed and efficacy in removing stromata, phospholipids and non-heme proteins from RBC hemolysates. The influence of both procedures upon spontaneous hemiglobin formation in stored, preferably freeze-dried SFH was compared. Among other analytical methods, sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) and isoelectrofocusing were used for mutual comparison of the purification procedures. Pasteurized samples were significantly better purified, more homogeneous but also more susceptible to spontaneous oxidation, probably due to heat inactivation of enzymic scavengers of oxygen radicals. On the other hand, the chloroform-treated, unheated SFH samples were less purified from non-heme proteins, but were more stable. Fructose and sucrose were equally active in protecting SFH from oxidation during freeze-drying. At present, the easy chloroform treatment and freeze-drying of thus purified SFH with fructose of sucrose seems to offer a plausible technological compromise which merits further investigation.\r"

The incidence was not influenced by the age at reduction, the duration of traction or the use of adductor tenotomy. Patients treated by closed reduction without preliminary traction did not have a higher incidence of avascular necrosis. At long-term clinical and radiological review of 81 hips, early avascular necrosis significantly increased the chance of a poor outcome but did not predispose to acetabular dysplasia. If review includes minor forms of avascular necrosis, then this condition is common after closed reduction. Its presence is an important determinant of long-term radiological and clinical outcome.\r"

Stereophotogrammetry was used in three patients to delineate the axis of rotation of the distal acetabular fragment and determine the locus of movement of the centre of the femoral head about it.

Remodelling occurred in 50% of hips with a head-shaft angle of 30 degrees or more; the probability of remodelling was significantly less the greater the degree of slip, but was significantly increased if the triradiate cartilage was open at the time of presentation. We found no significant effect for age, sex, weight or length of symptoms. The range of internal rotation was significantly greater in those hips that remodelled. We support the treatment of moderate slips in skeletally immature patients by pinning in situ, since the probability of satisfactory remodelling was 75% for slips of 40 degrees or less.\r"

In order to discover whether PGA implants are immunologically inert, density gradient-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in 0.2 ml of 10% delta FCS-RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10 mg PGA. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) lectin, a purified protein derivate of tuberculin (PPD) antigen and culture medium alone were used as positive and negative controls. We studied lymphocyte activation kinetics on days 0, 1, 3 and 5. Major histocompatibility complex locus II antigen (MHC locus II antigen) and interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression were analysed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method and lymphocyte DNA synthesis by using 3H-thymidine incorporation and beta-scintillation counting. Especially on culture days 0 and 1, lymphocytes and monocytes were seen by light microscopy to be attached to PGA particles. However, our results show no PGA-induced lymphocyte DNA synthesis, but PGA-induced MHC locus II antigen and IL-2R activation marker expression was seen, greater than in negative controls, but less than that seen in PPD antigen driven lymphocyte response. This suggests that PGA is an immunologically inert implant material, but it does seem to induce inflammatory mononuclear cell migration and adhesion, leading to a slight non-specific lymphocyte activation. This activation is lower than that seen in mitogen and antigen-driven lymphocyte responses.\r"

Of the medial meniscus tears, 75% were vertical and 23% horizontal. Vertical tears of the medial meniscus occurred most often in the fourth decade and horizontal tears in the fifth. There were 22% type I, 37% type II and 31% type III vertical tears; 62% of type I tears and 23% of type II tears had locked fragments. Superior flaps were six times more common than inferior flaps. Of all medial meniscus fragments, 6% were inverted; 51% of these were flaps and the rest ruptured bucket-handle fragments. Of the lateral meniscus lesions 54% were vertical tears, 15% oblique, 15% myxoid, 4% were inverted and 5% were lesions of discoid menisci. The commonest pattern of tear in the lateral compartment (27%) was a vertical tear involving half the length and half the width of the meniscus.\r"

Arthroscopy has confirmed that cartilage loss occurs in a more posterior portion of the femoral condyles than is revealed by radiographs taken in full extension. The 'standing tunnel view' is a weight-bearing postero-anterior radiograph taken with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion. The radiographs of 64 patients have been used to compare the conventional with the standing tunnel view. In 10 knees in which the conventional view suggested normal cartilage the standing tunnel view revealed severe degeneration.\r"

Better results were obtained in patients under 40 years of age with unilateral involvement and a mechanical (secondary) aetiology. An elliptical femoral head, minimal subluxation and an adequate pre-operative range of motion were also favourable. There was radiographic evidence of regression of the arthritic changes in 39% of the hips at final review. Valgus-extension osteotomy is effective for secondary osteoarthritis of the hip in selected younger patients, but not for those with primary hip disease or a poor range of movement.\r"

Survivorship analysis showed that 98% of the prostheses were retained for 10 years. On clinical and radiological examination 51 of the 71 hips were stable and acceptable, 15 had radiological changes on the acetabular side, and one on the femoral side; four other cases had clinical and radiological changes suggesting impending failure, possibly because fixation of the socket was inadequate. There were no differences between the results of the primary procedures and those of revisions. In these young patients, the results seem better with alumina-on-alumina hips than with other varieties, possibly because of their remarkably low wear.\r"

Neurological involvement was uncommon. Both operative and conservative treatment had resulted in fusion but all patients treated conservatively ended up with a kyphosis associated with trunk shortening. They had a higher incidence of back pain and more complications in pregnancy. Anterior debridement and fusion with a strut graft can reduce the incidence and size of kyphosis, but is technically demanding. Treatment remains difficult and requires individual consideration.\r"

  ".W": "Dynorphin-A and its related peptides are derived from prodynorphin, one of the three known endogenous opioid precursors. The prodynorphin gene is expressed in the vasopressinergic magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus, while its peptide products are present in the vasopressin (AVP) neurosecretory vesicles of the neurohypophysis. The concentration of immunoreactive (IR) dynorphin is orders of magnitude higher in the neurohypophysis than in any other tissue, suggesting that perhaps the prodynorphin-derived peptides are secreted from the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal unit into the general circulation. Experiments in rats have shown that osmotic stimuli increase both AVP and prodynorphin in the hypothalamus. To determine whether human hypothalamic prodynorphin is also under osmotic regulation, we measured plasma IR-dynorphin, plasma IR-AVP, and serum sodium immediately before and during the infusion of normal or hypertonic saline in normal human volunteers. Because of the unusual susceptibility of the prodynorphin-derived peptides to cleavage by endopeptidases, we also developed an appropriate plasma dynorphin extraction technique. We found that the IR-dynorphin present in human plasma was composed of 6K- and 4K-sized peptides and that no larger than 6K or smaller than 4K dynorphins were present. The infusion of normal saline did not have any significant effect on plasma IR-dynorphin, while 3% hypertonic saline increased its plasma levels. Thus, the mean IR-dynorphin level in the plasma of the volunteers infused with normal saline was 40.3 +/- 6.4 fmol/mL (mean +/- SE; n = 6) at zero time; after 30 min of infusion, plasma IR-dynorphin was 36.0 +/- 6.3, after 60 min it was 29.9 +/- 5, after 90 min it was 36.0 +/- 4.7, after 120 min it was 36.8 +/- 3.2, and after 150 min it was 36.0 +/- 6.1. The plasma IR-dynorphin level in the volunteers infused with hypertonic saline was 31.7 +/- 3.5 fmol/mL (mean +/- SE; n = 10) at zero time. After 30 min of infusion it increased to 37.4 +/- 3.8, after 60 min to 46.4 +/- 7.7, after 90 min to 56.2 +/- 9.1, after 120 min to 53.6 +/- 8.7, and after 150 min to 99.0 +/- 14.2. The increase in plasma IR-dynorphin with time was significant (P less than 0.0001) and correlated positively with serum sodium and plasma AVP. The physiological role of the prodynorphin-derived peptides of the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal unit is not yet known.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Short term suppression of ACTH by dexamethasone effects limited reduction in plasma deoxycorticosterone (DOC) while cortisol levels are almost completely suppressed in normal control subjects. The zona fasciculata (ZF) microsomal cytochrome P-450(21) appeared less influenced by lack of ACTH than mitochondrial cytochrome P-450(11 beta-18). Eleven patients with hypopituitarism were studied to quantitate basal ZF microsomal and mitochondrial derived steroids and their acute and extended responses to ACTH. Basal levels of 11-deoxycortisol (S) and DOC were modestly reduced (70% and 53%, respectively), while other ZF steroids were almost completely absent. Acute and prolonged ACTH treatment amplified the discrepancy in both plasma levels and production rates. DOC and S demonstrated prompt and sustained increases similar to those in normal controls, while cortisol, 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone, and corticosterone showed a slow subnormal recovery of steroid production. The preservation of microsomal cytochrome P-450(21) and P-450(17 alpha) to maintain DOC and S levels contrasts the reduced and delayed responses of steroids dependent on mitochondrial cytochrome P-450(11 beta-18), cortisol, corticosterone, and 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone. A greater effect of ACTH deficiency on mitochondrial over microsomal cytochrome P-450 activity is demonstrated, and in addition, the possibility is raised that other non-ACTH regulators sustain microsomal cytochrome P-450(21) and P-450(17 alpha) in a setting of reduced ACTH-stimulated factors.\r"

Mean resting basal catecholamine values were similar in the three groups. One-minute standing elicited an increase in norepinephrine plasma level (but not in epinephrine plasma levels) in control group but not in diabetic patients (with or without orthostatic hypotension). The maximal number of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors (and KD) calculated by [3H]yohimbine saturation experiments was similar in the three groups. The percentage of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors in high affinity state (inhibition experiments of [3H]yohimbine by UK14,304, a specific alpha 2-adrenergic full agonist) was significantly lower in diabetic patients with orthostatic hypotension (29.2 +/- 5.3%) than in the other two groups. No significant difference was found between the control group (60.0 +/- 2.0%) and diabetic patients without orthostatic hypotension (64.3 +/- 3.1%). Since platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors are thought to be a suitable index of vascular alpha-adrenoceptors, the decrease in platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors in high affinity state could explain the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms underly orthostatic hypotension in insulin-dependent diabetic patients and include anomalies both in the sympathetic nervous system and in alpha 2-adrenoceptor coupling.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the presence and characteristics of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors in hCG producing tumors (CC-2-JCK) transplanted in female nude mice. We also examined the in vivo effects of EGF on tumor growth. Specific receptors with apparent dissociation constants of 3.89 x 10(-10) and 1.0 x 10(-9) M and binding capacities of 5.96 x 10(-10) and 1.52 x 10(-9) M/mg protein for EGF have been identified in the hCG-producing tumor. [125I]EGF binding to the tumor tissues was time, temperature, and tissue weight dependent and specific. EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) competed for [125I]EGF binding, with 50% of the bound [125I]EGF displaced by approximately 0.52 nM EGF and 3.10 nM TGF alpha. TGF beta competed for [125I]EGF binding slightly. Five micrograms of EGF caused an increase in the rate of tumor growth, while 50 micrograms EGF strongly inhibited tumor growth. The concentration of [125I]EGF binding in the tumor treated with low doses of EGF was high, and that in the tumor treated with high doses of EGF was low. These changes in EGF binding were attributable to the changes in the number of high affinity EGF receptors with no significant alteration in binding affinity. In conclusion, the existence of high concentrations of EGF receptors with high affinity and specificity to EGF was demonstrated in an hCG-producing tumor transplanted in nude mice and appeared to be correlated with tumor growth.\r"

The pituitaries, obtained at operation or autopsy, were homogenized in 0.1 mol/L potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and centrifuged at 800 x g. Supernatants were incubated with [125I]T4 and 20 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37C for 90 min. T4 5'-D was measured by the release of 125I- with the ion exchange method. The activity of T4 5'-D in the pituitaries from patients with prolactinoma and parotid cancer was dependent on protein concentration, incubation time, incubation temperature, and T4 concentration, and was labile to prior heating at 70 C for 30 min. T4 5'-D was not inhibited by 1 mmol/L propylthiouracil, but was inhibited 95% by 0.1 mmol/L iopanoic acid. The apparent Km and maximum velocity for T4 5'-D in homogenates of prolactinoma at 20 mmol/L DTT were 11 nmol/L and 1.54 pmol/mg protein.h, respectively. This reaction followed sequential-type reaction kinetics when the DTT concentration was varied. All other homogenates of pituitary tumors, except two nonfunctioning tumors, also demonstrated T4 5'-D activity. These results indicate that 1) the human pituitary express a low Km and PTU-insensitive T4 5'-D activity which is very similar to the type II enzyme activity in the rat pituitary; and 2) various types of pituitary tumor cells contain T4 5'-D activity.\r"

Five patients had undergone surgery leaving tumor remnants and persistent hyperprolactinemia. The four others were de novo patients, two of whom had received short term treatment with Parlodel. Plasma PRL levels ranged from 235-6050 micrograms/L before treatment. The doses of CV used in this trial ranged from 0.075-0.600 mg. Plasma PRL normalized in eight of the nine patients during treatment with CV. The time to normalize varied from 2 weeks to 9 months, and the doses from 0.075-0.450 mg. A tumor volume reduction of more than 50% was obtained in all four patients who had not been operated on before CV treatment. Only one of the five patients with postoperative tumor remnants had no reduction in tumor size. The drug was generally well tolerated, and no patient interrupted the treatment. Slight and short-lasting gastrointestinal symptoms were noted in several patients, and a single episode of fainting occurred in one patient when the drug was not taken at bedtime as instructed. A noticeable and persistent weight loss with anorexia was noted in two patients. Since CV 205-502, administered in a single daily dose, has tolerable side-effects and is effective in reducing PRL secretion and tumor size, it can be considered to be a useful treatment for macroprolactinomas.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between circulating levels of PTH and the concentration and rate of change of ionized calcium (CaI) was studied in normal humans by measuring intact PTH during stepwise changes in CaI. Six normal subjects received two different citrate infusion protocols that produced stepwise decreases in CaI; one infusion produced a rapid decrement in calcium, and a second infusion produced a slower approach to the same (approximately 0.05 mmol/L) decline in calcium for each of four steps. The rapid decline in CaI resulted in a more marked increase in levels of PTH, which subsequently fell to levels similar to those with the slower infusion. For similar absolute changes in calcium, the mean maximal increment in PTH levels was significantly greater with the rapid infusion (36.4 +/- 3.1 ng/L) than with the slower infusion (19.4 +/- 2.1 ng/L; P = 0.001). Six additional subjects received infusions of citrate and calcium in a stepwise manner to induce either decreases or increases in CaI, followed by a return to baseline. During induced hypocalcemia, when calcium was changing slowly or not at all (i.e. at the plateau of each calcium change) PTH levels were not affected by the direction of change in calcium and appeared to be dependent upon the calcium concentration per se. At elevated levels of CaI, the PTH response to a stepwise decrease in calcium was blunted over that seen when CaI declined to or below baseline. Thus, the relationship between CaI and levels of PTH is dependent not only on the concentration but also on the rate of change in calcium, particularly during induced hypocalcemia; different rates of change in calcium result in different inverse sigmoidal relationships between PTH and CaI. When calcium is changing slowly or not at all, however, PTH levels appear to be dependent on the calcium concentration per se and are not affected by the previous direction or rate of change. Therefore, the role of the extracellular calcium concentration in the control of PTH secretion is part of more complex and dynamic regulatory mechanisms.\r"

Variations in the glycosylation pattern of G-hPRL altered its receptor-binding properties, suggesting that the site of glycosylation may be proximal to the receptor-binding region. Relative potencies for the displacement of [125I]hPRL by hPRL, G1-hPRL, and G2-hPRL were 100%, 40%, and 26%, respectively. Relative potencies for displacement of [125I]G1-hPRL by hPRL, G1-hPRL, and G2-hPRL were 100%, 44%, and 69%, respectively; however, the displacement curve for G2-hPRL was not parallel to the others. When G2-hPRL was radiolabeled, there was no specific binding to lactogenic receptors. The presence of PRL receptor subtypes and/or kinetic cooperativity was suggested by the complexity of the binding isotherms. The immunoreactivities of the PRLs were tested in a homologous RIA, using polyclonal antiserum. The modification of the glycosylation pattern of hPRL significantly altered the RIA values for PRL. When hPRL was used as the radiotracer, the percent cross-reactivities of hPRL, G1-hPRL, and G2-hPRL were approximately 100%, 23%, and 17%, respectively. When G1-hPRL was used as the radiotracer, the percent cross-reactivities were approximately 100%, 135%, and 54% for hPRL, G1-hPRL, and G2-hPRL; however, the displacement curve for hPRL was not parallel to those of the glycosylated hPRLs. When G2-hPRL was used as the radiotracer, the percent cross-reactivities were approximately 100%, 32%, and 37% for hPRL, G1-hPRL, and G2-hPRL. These data point out that the glycosylation heterogeneity of hPRL is a factor that affects the diagnostic accuracy of hPRL determinations. Specific RIAs for each PRL are needed so that we can have valid and reliable measurements of each PRL isoform and consequently gain a better understanding of PRL's complex biological role.\r"

  ".U": "90338309\r", 
  ".W": "The mRNA for human thyroid peroxidase (hTPO) is 3.1 kilobases (kb) in size, coding for a protein of 933 amino acids. However, there is controversy as to whether other hTPO mRNA transcripts exist in thyroid cells. There is one report of the existence of 2.1- and 1.7-kb transcripts (hTPO mRNA species I and II), representing up to half of the hTPO mRNA in TSH-stimulated human thyroid cells. On the other hand, numerous other studies have only observed 3.1-kb hTPO mRNA transcripts. The nature of these putative 2.1- and 1.7-kb mRNA transcripts, if present, is unknown. We now report the isolation and characterization of two smaller hTPO cDNA species, designated hTPO cDNA I and II. cDNA I and II are 1753 and 1044 basepairs (bp) in size, with open reading frames of only 225 and 174 amino acids, respectively. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of cDNA I and II with available hTPO genomic sequence reveals that cDNA I consists of exons 1-6 (654 bp) and the 5'-end of intron 6 (1099 bp); cDNA II contains exons 1-5 (486 bp) and an unidentified DNA tract of 558 bp further down-stream, presumably an intron. Confirmation that cDNA I and II correspond to mRNA transcripts I and II, respectively, was provided by Northern blot analysis with DNA probes specific for cDNA I and II. hTPO mRNA transcripts I and II are present in TSH-stimulated and TSH-deprived human thyroid cells in culture as well as in intact thyroid tissue. In summary, the present data 1) demonstrate directly that hTPO mRNA transcripts I and II exist in human thyroid cells, 2) explain the discrepant data in the literature regarding their existence, 3) elucidate their molecular structure, 4) indicate that they are generated by alternative splicing, and 5) demonstrate that hTPO mRNA I and II exist in the thyroid gland in vivo as well as in thyroid cells in culture.\r"

Membranes derived from LNCaP cells bound unliganded SHBG on two sets of sites whose affinities were: Ka1 = 3.1 +/- 1.6 x 10(10) M-1 and Ka2 = 8.7 +/- 4.3 x 10(6) M-1. Intact cells also bound SHBG, but even after 6 h, less than 10% of specifically bound SHBG was internalized. This observation speaks against a role for the membrane binding of SHBG in steroid transport across cell membranes. When LNCaP cells were prebound with SHBG, addition of dihydrotestosterone or estradiol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP. SHBG in the absence of steroids or dihydrotestosterone in the absence of SHBG was without effect. 2-Methoxyestradiol, a steroid metabolite without biological activity, but which binds to SHBG more tightly than does estradiol, was also without effect. These observations demonstrate a potentially important role for SHBG as a regulator of cell function. They also demonstrate an additional mode of action of steroid hormones, one that does not require that the steroid interact with a steroid receptor.\r"

Serum 25-hydroxy- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [25OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D] did not decline with age in either sex. Nonlinear regression using a sine function showed a significant seasonal variation in 25OHD and 1,25-(OH)2D in both sexes (P less than 0.005). Serum intact PTH increased significantly by 35% over the age span in both sexes (P less than 0.005). In women, serum phosphorus and total and ionized calcium remained constant with age. In sharp contrast, males had a marked 25% fall in phosphorus across the age span (r = -0.564; P less than 0.0001) and a slight but significant 4% decline in total and ionized calcium. Creatinine clearance declined markedly with age, but was not related to 1,25-(OH)2D in either sex. Only in men was there a significant but modest inverse relationship between creatinine clearance and PTH (r = -0.212; P less than 0.05), which was multicollinear with age. We conclude that in healthy individuals 1) compromised vitamin D status or serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels are not a normal concomitant of aging; 2) declining glomerular filtration does not appear to be the principle cause of the age-related rise in PTH; and 3) there are marked male-female differences in phosphorus metabolism across the age span.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the course of papillary thyroid carcinoma in 269 patients managed at the University of Chicago, with an average follow-up period of 12 yr from the time of diagnosis. Patients were categorized by clinical class; I, with intrathyroidal disease; II, with cervical nodal metastases; III, with extrathyroidal invasion; and IV, with distant metastases. Half of the patients had a history of thyroid enlargement known, on the average, for over 3 yr. In 15% of patients given thyroid hormone, the mass decreased in size. The peak incidence of cancer was when subjects were between 20-40 yr of age. Tumors averaged 2.4 cm in size; 21.6% had tumor capsule invasion, and 46% of patients had multifocal tumors. Sixty-six percent of the patients had near-total or total thyroidectomy. The overall incidence of postoperative hypoparathyroidism was 8.4%, but the incidence was zero in 83 near-total or total thyroidectomies carried out by 1 surgeon. Twenty-five percent of the patients had continuing or recurrent disease, and 8.2% died from cancer. Deaths occurred largely in patients with class III or IV disease. Cervical lymph nodes were associated with increased recurrences, but not increased deaths. Extrathyroidal invasion carried an increased risk of 5.8-fold for death, and distant metastases increased this risk 47-fold. Age over 45 yr at diagnosis increased the risk of death 32-fold. Tumor size over 3 cm increased the risk of death 5.8-fold. Surgical treatment combining lobectomy plus at least contralateral subtotal thyroidectomy was associated, by Cox proportional hazard analysis, with decreased risk of death in patients with tumors larger than 1 cm and decreased risk of recurrence among all patients, including patients in classes I and II, compared to patients who underwent unilateral thyroid surgery or bilateral subtotal resections. By chi 2 analysis, 131I ablation of residual thyroid tissue after operation was associated with decreased risk of recurrence in tumors larger than 1 cm and decreased risk of death in patients in classes I and II with tumors more than 1 cm in size. The data strongly support the use of more extensive initial surgery in class I and II patients with tumors more than 1 cm in size as well as postoperative radioactive 131I ablation of thyroid remnant tissue.\r"

In this study the effects of CLON (150 micrograms/m2, orally) on GH secretion were studied both in the morning (from 0800-1100 h) and at night (from 2300-0200 h) in nine short children previously shown to have normal spontaneous nocturnal GH secretion. In the morning, CLON induced a GH increase higher than placebo [peak (mean +/- SEM), 23.8 +/- 4.3 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.4 micrograms/L; P = 0.0001; area under curve (AUC), 624.4 +/- 62.7 vs. 135.6 +/- 33.3 micrograms/L.h; P less than 0.00001]. In the night, no difference was observed between GH secretion after CLON (peak, 15.4 +/- 3.2 micrograms/L; AUC, 562.2 +/- 57.5 micrograms/L.h) and placebo (peak, 13.1 +/- 4.7 micrograms/L; AUC, 497.2 +/- 83.5 micrograms/L.h). Spontaneous GH secretion was higher during the night than in the morning (P = 0.0001), whereas nocturnal GH secretion overlapped with that in the morning after CLON. The data presented show that alpha 2-adrenoreceptor activation is probably mediated by increased endogenous GHRH release; our results suggest that the endogenous GHRH secretion is maximally stimulated at night.\r"

  ".W": "A tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TrACP), which has been suggested to be very similar to the osteoclastic TrACP, was partially purified from the spleen of a patient with hairy cell leukemia. The purification procedure consisted of carboxymethyl-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, Sephacryl S-200, and phenyl-Sepharose chromatographies. Polyclonal antibodies were generated in guinea pigs with a titer of at least 1:6000. Immunohistochemical staining of fetal rat tibia with the antisera revealed that only the lysosomes of osteoclasts, but not osteoblasts, were stained. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed with the antisera. There was no cross-reactivity with 1) partially purified acid phosphatases (ACPs) from normal human and beef spleens, 2) ACPs in extracts of human osteoblastic cells, 3) purified bovine bone matrix TrACP, or 4) commercial prostatic ACP. However, extracts of giant cell bone tumors, containing large amounts of bona fide osteoclasts, showed large amounts of cross-reactive material, which diluted in parallel with the partially purified hairy cell leukemic TrACP in the ELISA. Commercial serum band 5b TrACP also displaced in parallel with the partially purified hairy cell leukemic TrACP. Immunoblotting studies revealed that the antiserum, but not nonimmune guinea pig serum, reacted with the homogeneous hairy cell leukemia splenic band 5 TrACPs, which were recently purified by our laboratory. Preliminary application of the ELISA to sera of patients with metabolic bone diseases revealed that normal healthy individuals had measurable amounts of the immunoreactive material, and patients with Paget's disease or hyperparathyroidism, who should have high bone turnover, had elevated levels of this immunoreactive material in their sera. In contrast, the level of serum osteoclastic TrACP in a patient with an acute lymphatic leukemia was normal. In summary, 1) we have shown that hairy cell leukemia splenic TrACP shares significant immunological similarity with the osteoclastic TrACP and with the serum band 5b TrACP, and 2) the ELISA holds promise for a sensitive and specific assay for bone resorption.\r"

  ".W": "It has become evident that locally produced insulin-like growth factors-I and -II (IGF-I and IGF-II) play an important role in the medication of GH action upon tissues. To explore this concept with respect to immunocompetent cells, we analyzed IGF production and clonogenic responsiveness of immortalized human T-cell lines established from seven normal controls and four Laron dwarfs. While the normal T-cell lines showed significant augmentation of basal colony formation in response to both IGF-I and GH, little increase in clonogenesis in response to GH was seen with the Laron T-cell lines. Assay of basal and GH-stimulated conditioned media demonstrated low, but measurable, levels of IGF-I and IGF-II from both normal and Laron T-cells. Under serum-free incubation conditions, GH stimulation of normal T-cell lines failed to generate significant increases in mean IGF-I or IGF-II concentration and no increase in the mean IGF-II concentration in conditioned medium were observed after GH stimulation of Laron T-cell lines. Nevertheless, the increased cloning efficiency of the normal T-cell lines in response to either GH or IGF-I was nearly completely abrogated by preincubation of cells with antibodies to either IGF-I or the type I IGF receptor. These studies, thus, support a role for locally generated IGF-I in the mediation of GH action on T-lymphocytes and indicate that this effect is mediated via the type I IGF receptor.\r"

  ".U": "90338320\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that a substantial part of human GH is complexed with GH-binding proteins (BPs) when GH is incubated with plasma in vitro. The proportion of GH bound in vivo, however, is unknown and may differ because of factors that cannot be assessed in vitro, such as binding to tissue receptors, distribution of GH outside the vascular compartment, and fluctuating GH and possibly BP levels. Accordingly, we studied the plasma transport characteristics of GH in vivo in six normal men. Monomeric, natural sequence human GH (Humatrope, Eli Lilly Co.) was injected iv in a dose designed to yield physiological plasma levels. Endogenous GH was suppressed before injection with oral glucose administration. Fifteen minutes after injection, plasma was obtained and immediately analyzed by zonal and frontal analysis in gel chromatography, followed by GH measurement in the fractions by RIA. The results obtained were very similar to those derived from in vitro studies, regardless of which analytical method was used. Frontal analysis at 37 C, which most directly reflects the true bound fraction, showed that 38.8 +/- 4.7% (mean +/- SD) of GH was bound to BPs at plasma GH levels ranging from 32-59 micrograms/L, indistinguishable from in vitro results. [When allowance was made for partial BP saturation, the fraction bound at low GH levels (greater than 7 micrograms/L) was calculated as 45.5 +/- 7.5%.] There was evidence for binding to both high and low affinity BPs in the expected proportions. In contrast to complex formation between GH and BPs, no evidence was obtained for conversion of the monomeric GH to oligomeric forms. We conclude that in vitro predictions about binding of GH to BPs in human plasma are representative of in vivo conditions. Shortly after a GH pulse, almost half of plasma GH circulates in complexed form, primarily bound to the high affinity (receptor-related) BP. Aggregation of GH in plasma does not occur (at least within a 15-min period), suggesting that the pituitary is the predominant, if not sole, source of circulating GH oligomers.\r"

  ".W": "The recent discovery of a GH-binding protein (GH-BP) in human serum has important implications for the distribution, metabolism, and physiological activity of human GH (hGH). In this report we describe an accurate, simple, and rapid assay for measuring GH-BP in human serum, based on the dextran-coated charcoal technique for separating bound from free hGH. The present method reduces the degree of dissociation of the GH-BP complex during the separation procedure, thus increasing accuracy, allows routine use of small working volumes of sera, and can be practically used for running large scale assays. Binding of [125I]hGH to human serum GH-BP, identified and characterized by this procedure, was time, temperature, and dose dependent; the binding was highly specific for hGH and with a high affinity (Ka, 1.08 +/- 0.19 x 10(9) L/mol). Preliminary results, expressed as percent specifically bound [125I]hGH corrected for endogenous hGH, indicate that the mean GH-BP activity in 50 microL sera from normal adult men and women was 11.32 +/- 0.45%. Significantly lower values were obtained in sera of infants, 3 days after birth (1.65 +/- 0.15%), and in short-statured children with normal GH secretion (7.38 +/- 0.22%). In patients with liver cirrhosis GH-BP levels decreased to 5.93 +/- 1.14%. The availability of a simple and convenient procedure for large scale determination of GH-BP coupled with the suggestion that this protein can reflect the GH receptor provides us with an indirect means for assessing changes in GH receptor activity in various physiological and pathological conditions.\r"

The circadian and seasonal variations in FF melatonin were also analyzed. The FF melatonin concentrations in stimulated (mean +/- SEM, 61.9 +/- 6.4 pmol/L) and spontaneous cycles (98.1 +/- 8.9 pmol/L) were significantly higher (P less than 0.005) than those in peripheral serum (25.4 +/- 1.2 and 38.6 +/- 1.8 pmol/L, respectively), and in the stimulated cycles there was a positive correlation between them. The FF melatonin concentration in the morning (58.9 +/- 3.8 pmol/L) was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) than that in the daytime (23.2 +/- 0.8 pmol/L), but the morning concentrations did not differ between the light and the dark seasons of the year, whereas the daytime values were higher (P less than 0.005) during the dark season (27.1 +/- 2.1 pmol/L) than during the light season (21.1 +/- 2.1 pmol/L). The FF melatonin concentration did not correlate with follicular volume, and FF and serum melatonin concentrations showed no significant correlation with the serum concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, or PRL. There were also no differences between FF melatonin concentrations in aspirates with or without an ovum. In summary, significant circadian and circannual variations in high FF melatonin concentrations were found, which suggest that melatonin could potentially interfere with the regulation of reproduction in humans at the follicular level.\r"

We now confirm preferential accumulation of this compound in the normal adrenal gland, evaluate its in vitro effect against two human adrenocortical carcinoma cell lines (SW-13 and NCI-H295), and report the clinical activity of suramin in 17 patients with metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma. Inhibition of colony formation occurred in both adrenal cell lines in vitro at concentrations that are clinically achievable in humans. In addition, suramin concentrations as low as 100 micrograms/mL were able to inhibit glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgen production by the NCI-H295 cell line. Of 16 patients with adrenocortical carcinoma now evaluable for tumor response, 2 achieved a partial response, 2 had a minor response, and 5 remained with stable disease for periods ranging from 3-10 months; the remainder progressed. One of 7 patients with excessive steroid hormone production achieved a partial normalization of her steroid levels for the duration of suramin therapy in the setting of radiographic disease stabilization. An additional patient treated off-study for lack of radiographically measurable disease, achieved complete normalization of plasma aldosterone levels. We conclude that suramin preferentially accumulates in adrenal cells, induces cytotoxicity and significant down-regulation of steroid hormone production in vitro, and has some therapeutic efficacy as a single agent in patients with metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma.\r"

Subjects over 50 yr of age had significantly smaller pituitary gland height (P = 0.03), area (P = 0.04), and volume (P = 0.04) than those under 50 yr (by two-tailed t test). Overall, age was negatively correlated with pituitary volume (V1: r = -0.51; P = 0.003; V2: r = -0.47; P = 0.008), area (r = -0.43; P = 0.009), and height (r = -0.46; P = 0.005), but not with pituitary length or width. There were no statistically significant differences in pituitary size between men and women (by two-tailed t test). These findings suggest that pituitary gland height provides a good single measure for the assessment of pituitary gland size and that age must be controlled for in studies of pituitary gland size.\r"

All sera were tested for dsDNA antibodies by 2 quantitative RIAs (Farr assay and Millipore filter assay; normal, less than 20% for both assays) and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay for antibodies to dsDNA and to single stranded DNA (ssDNA). All sera were negative for dsDNA antibodies by the Farr assay and by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, 2 of 42 had mildly elevated levels (33% and 23%) by the Millipore filter assay, and 7 of 42 were positive for ssDNA antibodies. The 2 positive sera for dsDNA antibodies were also tested using the Crithidia luciliae indirect immunofluorescence assay, and both were negative. Patients with Graves' disease have been reported to have an increased prevalence of antinuclear antibodies, but the more recent findings of dsDNA antibodies in these patients is of interest because dsDNA antibodies are considered to be specific for systemic lupus erythematosus. Our data suggest that true immunoglobulin G dsDNA antibodies are not elevated during active Graves' disease, and positive assay results may be due to measurement of ssDNA antibodies, immunoglobulin M dsDNA antibodies, or nonantibody DNA binding.\r"

She presented all the features of the classical severe form of the disease: complete female phenotype; hypertension; hypokalemia; elevated levels of plasma progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone (B), and ACTH; and suppression of renin and aldosterone production. Levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and all androgens were barely detectable. Hormone steroid patterns were determined in basal conditions and after acute ACTH stimulation in the parents and the two unaffected brothers in order to identify the heterozygotes. Subtle abnormalities in B and aldosterone secretion were observed in the male members of the family. On the basis of an increased ratio of B to aldosterone the two brothers were assumed to be heterozygotes. The mother had normal basal and stimulated levels of B, deoxycorticosterone, and aldosterone. In the parents and two brothers the progesterone responses to ACTH were exaggerated. The most striking finding in the father and both brothers was the observation of increased basal plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone, unresponsive to ACTH stimulation, suggesting a partial Leydig cell 17,20-lyase deficiency in the male heterozygotes of this family. This study shows that a short ACTH test can help to identify the heterozygotes in affected families, but the abnormalities found are more heterogeneous than previously suggested.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that hIGFBP-1 is a minor component of IGFBPs secreted by Hs578T cells and is absent in CM from MCF-7 cells. In our present report, we describe the immunological and structural relationship of HBCC IGFBPs to hIGFBP-2 and hIGFBP-3. Analysis of conditioned media (CM) from Hs578T by Western ligand blotting revealed three IGFBPs of apparent Mr = 38K, 28K, and 24K; CM from MCF-7 revealed only two IGFBPs, of apparent Mr = 31K and 24K. Immunoprecipitation studies with polyclonal antibodies raised against hIGFBP-2 and hIGFBP-3 demonstrated that the 38K IGFBP in Hs578T CM is immunologically related to hIGFBP-3, while the 31K IGFBP in MCF-7 cells is related to the hIGFBP-2. Analysis by Northern blot demonstrated that MCF-7 cells contained mRNA for hIGFBP-2, while Hs578T cells contained the mRNA characteristic of the hIGFBP-3. The identity of the 24K IGFBP remains unknown, and may represent a distinct IGFBP. Of note, assay of CM following removal of BPs by acid chromatography demonstrated no detectable IGF-I or -II. The role of these IGFBPs in HBCC is of interest in view of the potential modulation of IGF actions by these proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), are produced by several cell types, are present in biological fluids, and may function in modulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF) biological activities. Recently the presence of multiple IGFBPs was reported in seminal fluid, suggesting that IGFBPs are produced by prostatic epithelium. We have found that human prostatic tumor cells of the PC3 cell line produce an IGFBP. PC3-IGFBP was purified to homogeneity using sequential IGF I affinity and HPLC C4 reverse phase chromatographies. Chemical cross-linking of PC3-IGFBP to 125I-IGF I revealed a molecular weight of 25 kDa. Its N-terminal sequence and amino-acid composition were highly homologous to that of a recently described 25 kDa inhibitory IGFBP (In-IGFBP), produced by osteoblasts in vitro. PC3-IGFBP inhibited basal and IGF II-stimulated bone cell DNA synthesis. We conclude that the PC3-IGFBP is very similar, if not identical to the osteoblast-derived In-IGFBP. Expression of PC3-IGFBP by metastatic human prostate tumor cells thus might affect the osteoblast proliferation that is induced by metastatic prostatic carcinoma. The PC3-IGFBP may be similar to a 24 kDa IGFBP described in seminal fluid and thus may be important in the regulation of cell proliferation in the male reproductive tract.\r"

  ".W": "An increased colonic epithelial proliferation rate and an increase of the cryptal proliferative zone are probable markers of increased susceptibility to colonic cancer. In this study an immunohistochemical method using 5-bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) to measure the proliferation rate of colonic mucosa in vitro was used. Fresh endoscopic colonic biopsy specimens were incubated with BrdUrd and then processed for immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody. Essential procedures with respect to the equal distribution of nuclei stained with BrdUrd in the biopsy specimens proved to be the cutting of the specimens before incubation and the use of a microwave oven at the beginning of incubation. The use of the procedure of the running average showed that 12 length cut crypts are sufficient to determine reliably the proliferation rate, expressed as the labelling index (LI). This was determined in the biopsy specimens of 10 subjects without organic colonic disease, eight patients with adenomatous colonic polyps, and in six patients with (recent) colonic carcinoma. Mean LI in the controls was significantly lower than in patients with colonic polyps and in those with colon cancer. It is concluded that this method is promising for screening persons at risk for colon cancer and will be of great potential in performing dietary intervention studies in these subjects.\r"

Five of the 76 donors possessed an abnormally thin basement membrane, similar to that observed in thin membrane nephropathy, while in two others the measurements fell in the overlap range between thin and normal. Seven donors therefore had a definite or possible basement membrane lesion. After taking account of an additional series of controls, unrelated to transplantation, it is suggested that the incidence of this abnormality in the general population lies between 5.2% and 9.2%. Circumstances did not allow any association between a thin basement membrane and haematuria or other clinical manifestations to be detected.\r"

  ".W": "Attenuated or partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency is one of several biochemical defects in steroid metabolism that can lead to hirsutism in young women after puberty. The diagnosis is made through the exaggerated response of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OH) to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). To provide reference data 72 mild to moderately hirsute patients aged 18 to 35 were studied (over two years) with the ACTH test. Four patients with an exaggerated response were found. The mean (+/- 1SD) for zero time was 2.4 (0.96) nmol/l and for the 60 minute time was 7.2 (2.04) nmol/l. A subpopulation was found with a significantly higher baseline at 6.2 (1.3) nmol/l but a blunted 60 minute response at 8.7 (2.5) nmol/l. This is important because of the potential confusion arising from the known variability in baseline values in previously reported patients with partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Extending the test to 90 minutes did not show further increase in the 17-OH response to ACTH, thus confirming the validity of the 60 minutes ACTH test. The cortisol response to ACTH was also studied. One patient with presumptive partial 21-hydroxylase deficiency overlapped in cortisol response with eight of the reference population. Theoretically, a blunted cortisol response would be expected because of the postulated enzyme block, and these results suggest that other steroid enzyme defects should also be considered when an exaggerated 17-OH response to ACTH is seen.\r"

The analysis yields an estimate of the in vivo mutation rate of 8 x 10(-8)/gene/cell division (range 5.5 x 10(-8) to 1.3 x 10(-7]. The estimated non-replication association in vivo mutation rate is 2.4 x 10(-8)/gene/year (range 0 to 6.8 x 10(-8]. The formula is an improvement on previous attempts to produce a model of the process of mutation during cell generation. It can be applied to neoplastic disease in both children and adults.\r"

A one hour incubation with proteinase K was the most efficient DNA extraction procedure for fresh tissue. For paraffin wax embedded tissue a five day incubation with proteinase K was required to produce good yields of DNA. Incubation with sodium dodecyl sulphate produced very poor yields, while boiling produced 20% as much DNA as long enzyme digestion. DNA extracted by these methods was suitable for the PCR amplification of a single copy gene. Proteinase K digestion also produced considerable amounts of RNA which has previously been shown to be suitable for PCR analysis. A delay before fixation had no effect on the amount of DNA obtained while fixation in Carnoy's reagent results in a much better preservation of DNA than formalin fixation, allowing greater yields to be extracted.\r"

The ultracentrifuged cell sonicate, acid glycine extract, and 120 kilodalton protein antigens were specific in diagnosing infection (95-98%), but had only moderate sensitivity (70-84%). By mixing either of the two complex antigens with the 120 kilodalton protein, the sensitivity of the test was increased to 97% without affecting the high specificity. The combination of ultracentrifuged sonicate or acid glycine extract with the 120 kilodalton protein therefore seems to be superior to the individual antigen preparations and is particularly suitable for the serodiagnosis of H pylori infection.\r"

The sensitivity was related to the amount of virus particles present in the stool sample, increasing to 90% with about 10(7) viral particles/ml of stool. The ELISA was easy to perform, requiring no instrumentation, and is a useful first line test for detection of adenoviruses in stool samples, especially in laboratories without access to an electron microscope. Wider use of ELISAs should help in evaluating the role of adenoviruses in viral gastroenteritis.\r"

Changes in sialic acid were uncommon in adenomas showing mild dysplasia but became increasingly common in moderately and severely dysplastic adenomas and were always present in carcinomatous areas. There was no correlation between a change in sialic acid and either size or villous architecture of benign adenomas. As mucin change often preceded the development of invasive cancer, it could not be used on its own to distinguish between epithelial displacement (pseudoinvasion) and malignant invasion. An abundant luminal accumulation of altered sialic acid in association with an epithelial lining that was non-mucin secreting, however, was specific for cancer. Conversely, the presence of unchanged intracellular or intraluminal O-acetyl sialic acid may help to exclude a diagnosis of malignancy in equivocal cases. The change is not specific for colorectal neoplasms and probably represents a metaplasia to a small intestinal phenotype.\r"

Of these, 14 tumours were located in the jejunum: the remainder arose in the ileum. The average age at presentation was 61.3 years and a slight female to male preponderance of 1:7:1 was noted. The adenocarcinoma arose from a preexisting villous adenoma in six cases. The overall prognosis was poor, with a five year survival of 15.7%. All the survivors had tumours located in the jejunum. The single most important prognostic indicator was the depth of tumour invasion or stage at the time of diagnosis. Tumour size and grade did not seem to correlate well with survival. It is concluded that the rarity of these tumours and their inaccessibility hinder detection and treatment and that surgical resection is more effective than chemotherapy.\r"

In the invasive component there was a correlation between MC2 expression and tumour type, suggesting that the cell surface carbohydrate detected by MC2 may have a role in cell adhesion. There was no correlation between staining and survival. It is concluded that tumour type, grade, and stage remain the best prognostic indicators of urothelial tumours.\r"

All the tumours available for review were classic diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Where immunocytological studies were positive, the tumour cells were of B cell origin. None was of T cell origin, although reactive T cells in the tumours were frequently identified.

These changes closely resemble those that occur in the ectocervical mucosa which are accepted as morphological evidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Sections of 87 hysterectomy specimens removed for endometrial carcinoma over 12 years, together with preoperative curettings, were reviewed for the presence of acanthomatous change and for appearances suggestive of HPV infection. The ages of the women ranged from 36 to 84 years, average age 62.6. Light microscopical examination showed koilocytosis, papillary formations, and intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions of both squamous and glandular epithelium in some tumours. Immunocytochemistry and DNA in situ hybridisation indicated the presence of HPV antigen in squamous and glandular cells, and perinuclear virus particles characteristic of HPV were seen on electron microscopical examination in those cells with nuclear inclusions. HPV probably infects endometrial adenocarcinomas directly from the cervix but it is unlikely that it has an aetiological role. It is possible, however, that in addition to being a \"passenger,\" the virus may stimulate squamous metaplasia in some adenocarcinomas of the endometrium and may also exert some influence on their behaviour.\r"

Cholesterol absorption was proportional to cholesterol concentration when real bile was used, but model biles showed maximal absorption at cholesterol saturation. Reduction of temperature reduced cholesterol absorption and serosal secretion, but had little effect on dextran absorption. This indicates differences in uptake where cholesterol undergoes passive diffusion but dextran is taken up by fluid-phase endocytosis. Model bile prepared with a single bile salt showed lowest cholesterol uptake from cholate bile, but there was no difference in serosal secretion. Dextran uptake was also lowest from cholate bile, although serosal secretion was highest. These results show that an increase in the biliary content of dihydroxy bile salts increases gall bladder permeability to both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules and may lead to the accumulation of lipids in the mucosa, as seen in cholesterolosis.\r"

The diagnostic use of this technique was shown in four cases in which lavage sediments proved negative for intact Pneumocystis carinii organisms on first examination; 2G2 reactive soluble antigen, however, was identified in the immunoblots of the supernatants from the same samples.

Alternative methods have been suggested in recent months, including solutions of alcian blue, and Tippex. These methods use one colour only and Tippex is radiodense. Artists' pigments have been used, but their radiodensity makes them unsuitable for the detailed mammograms of the sliced screened specimens. An alternative method was specifically designed for impalpable breast lesions. It is based on coloured gelatins that are painted on to the biopsy specimen before dissection. The markers are radiolucent, quick to set, and do not penetrate the connective tissue. They can be applied to both fresh and fixed tissues, and the cost is about 0.05 pounds a specimen. The system is also suitable for marking other large specimens.\r"

Fewer than 16% of the respondents used mathematical models for forecasting demand. The moving average technique was the most frequently used mathematical model (8.5%). Variations of the naive or nonmathematical model were used by the majority of respondents. Judgment based on the past records was the most frequently cited variation (89.4%). The foodservice director/manager was the person most frequently responsible for forecasting decisions (83.7%). Typically, determining production demand was conducted 1 week in advance (36.5%). Computers were used by fewer than 38% of respondents for production forecasting. Approximately 79% indicated that forecasting was very important. Respondents indicated a need for improvement in practice and additional training in the area of forecasting. Therefore, continuing education in forecasting should remain a priority for dietetic practitioners.\r"

Questionnaires including 30 items on job characteristics, 15 items on organizational commitment, 6 items related to job satisfaction, and 7 demographic items were administered to 45 supervisory and 172 nonsupervisory employees of 11 randomly selected hospitals. The reliability for the total instruments, using Cronbach's alpha, was 0.87 and 0.89, respectively, for the supervisory and nonsupervisory employee questionnaires. Organizational commitment and job satisfaction were related positively, with an r2 of 0.38. For supervisors, job characteristics related positively (p = .019) to organizational commitment, with variety being the only significant individual characteristic. For nonsupervisory employees, the model was also significant (p = .0001), with variety and feedback being the only significant individual characteristics. For all employees, there was a positive relationship between job characteristics and job satisfaction, with variety and feedback being the significant individual characteristics. Age was the only demographic variable related to organizational commitment; older employees had higher commitment scores. Demographic variables were not related to job satisfaction. Supervisors had higher perceived variety, autonomy, feedback, dealing with others, and friendship opportunities scores and higher commitment and satisfaction scores than did nonsupervisory employees. The findings indicate that dietitians and foodservice managers may increase organizational commitment and job satisfaction by increasing the variety and feedback in employees' jobs.\r"

  ".W": "From February 1986 to January 1988, samples of several processed Florida citrus juice products--frozen concentrated orange juice, orange juice from concentrate, pasteurized orange juice, grapefruit juice, and grapefruit juice from concentrate--were surveyed regularly during production. Samples were assayed for sodium, potassium, ascorbic acid, thiamin, calcium, iron, folic acid, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, and copper primarily for the purpose of nutrition labeling. Means, standard deviations of the means, and maximum and minimum values of each nutrient are expressed in mg/6 fl oz for each product. In addition, the estimated percentage of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance (U.S. RDA) for each nutrient claimable at time of packing is given. (To be claimed on a nutrition label, a nutrient must occur at a minimum level of 2% of the U.S. RDA per serving, according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] regulations.) The estimated percentage of the U.S. RDA claimable for ascorbic acid ranged from 90% to 100% in the orange juice products and was 70% for the grapefruit juice products. These juices are all considered significant sources of vitamin C. In the orange juice products, the percentage of the U.S. RDA for thiamin ranged from 6% to 8% and was 8% for folic acid. Significantly smaller amounts of each vitamin were noted in the grapefruit juices. Small but claimable levels of magnesium, calcium, copper, and phosphorus were found in one or more of the products tested. Neither zinc nor iron was found at the U.S. RDA minimum level of 2%. Significant amounts of potassium, for which there is no established U.S. RDA, were found in all the citrus juice products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Samples were classified into three groups: \"sodium-free\" products (less than 5 mg sodium per serving), and \"very-low-sodium\" products (5 to 35 mg per serving), and a larger group of products that were labeled as containing more than 35 mg sodium per serving. In the third group, the distribution of actual sodium content fell around 100% of label claims for sodium. For the three survey years, analyzed sodium averaged 101% of label claim (standard deviation [SD] = 25%) for 1982 samples (20 products), 99% of label claim (SD = 28%) for 1984 samples (108 products), and 94% of label claim (SD = 21%) for 1986 samples (265 products). Products labeled \"very low sodium\" were treated separately because sodium analyses varied widely from the label declarations. However, most \"very-low-sodium\" products were well under 35 mg sodium per serving. Results indicated that consumers receive reasonably accurate information about the sodium content of processed packaged foods from label claims.\r"

The amount of zinc provided by the U.S. food supply has varied between 11 and 13 mg/day/person since the beginning of the century. Currently, it is estimated that the U.S. food supply provides 12.3 mg zinc per person per day. Data from the Food and Drug Administration's Total Diet Study and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Nationwide Food Consumption Survey of Individuals and year-long Beltsville diet study indicate that adult males select diets that contain 90% or more of the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for zinc, whereas women select diets that have less than 81% of the RDA for zinc. Zinc densities of the diets for men and women were similar, which suggests that the difference in total zinc intake is attributable to a difference in energy consumption. Consumption patterns that meet the RDA for zinc can be compatible with the recent National Academy of Sciences diet and health recommendations. The dietetic practitioner should encourage consumption patterns that include using zinc-rich foods in the form of poultry and lean meats and low-fat or nonfat dairy products; using grain products and legumes, particularly whole grains, which can make an important contribution to total zinc intake; and increasing physical activity to a moderately active level to increase energy and zinc intake.\r"

  ".W": "Nutritionists in both clinical and field settings often work with populations whose cultures and languages differ from their own. Therefore, intercultural communication skills are often needed. This article presents a method used to collect dietary data for 125 children under 26 months old living in Liberia. The method was designed to reduce intercultural communication errors during collection of dietary data by avoiding terms directly related to the English language words \"food\" or \"to eat,\" and by replacing such terms with words or phrases with a more general meaning, for example, \"thing\" for food or \"had\" for eat. By using this method the following results were obtained: mean age for introducing non-breast-milk foods to infants, 1.9 months (no. = 113, standard deviation [SD] = 2.1 months); mean age for introducing milk-based foods, 1.5 months (no. = 74, SD = 1.6 months); and mean age for introducing non-milk foods, 2.9 months (no. = 110, SD = 2.5 months). These ages are 2 to 4 months earlier than those determined in two previous studies conducted in Liberia. The difference is probably attributable to incongruity between the interviewer's and interviewee's definitions of words. The resultant impact on feeding recommendations because of differences in data and, therefore, in conclusions, demonstrates that accuracy of dietary data at the individual level may be critical for epidemiological studies. The method of using more general terms and avoiding restricting terms such as \"food\" and \"eat\" may help nutritionists improve the accuracy and completeness of dietary data during intercultural interviews. Additional research in wording dietary recall questions will help determine whether this method is generally applicable.\r"

Because of purging behaviors and erratic food consumption, the oral manifestations of bulimia frequently include irreversible enamel erosion, xerostomia, and oral mucosal irritation. A pilot study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the dental/dietitian team in assessing the dental health of individuals with bulimia. Control and bulimic subjects were compared. The results demonstrated a significantly different (p less than .05) intake of folacin-412 micrograms in controls compared with 207 micrograms in bulimic subjects. Control subjects were found to have significantly greater (p less than .05) amounts of calculus deposits on teeth; however, subjects with bulimia demonstrated a lower (p less than .05) saliva pH. We conclude that the collaborative effort of the dental/dietitian team was useful in the assessment of dental health. The team approach may also help to identify clients with bulimia and facilitate therapy.\r"

A nationwide mail survey was conducted on random samples of 3,559 dietitians who had been registered for up to 3 years, 6,647 dietitians who had been registered for more than 3 years, and all 1,226 graduates (in the previous 3 years) from the 70 ADA-approved programs preparing dietetic technicians that agreed to participate (out of the 77 ADA-approved programs). Response rates of 77.5%, 78.7%, and 68.5% were achieved for the two samples of registered dietitians and the sample of dietetic technicians, respectively. The results show that the most commonly chosen work setting for the three respondent groups was \"inpatient-care, acute-care facility.\" There were substantial differences among the three groups in the types of activities performed and in the level of responsibility for various kinds of activities. The beyond-entry-level registered dietitians were involved in the broadest range of activities and had the most responsibility for policy setting and other administrative activities, such as preparing budgets. The results of the study provide a detailed description of dietetic practice over a broad range of practitioner-experience levels, practice settings, and client groups.\r"

In the present study, we have examined the expression and function of the 10D1 Ag on human thymocytes. Three-color FMF analysis showed that the 10D1 Ag was highly expressed on minor but distinct subpopulations of double-negative and CD4 single-positive thymocytes, and weakly on a part of double-positive thymocytes, but not on CD8 single-positive thymocytes. In double-negative thymocytes, the vast majority of 10D1+ cells were immature thymocytes of CD7+2+3- phenotype. Interestingly, 10D1 mAb could induce the proliferation of CD4 single-positive thymocytes in the presence of goat anti-mouse Ig to cross-link the 10D1 Ag. The treatment of thymocytes with OKT4 mAb plus C but not with OKT8 mAb plus C totally abrogated the proliferative response induced by 10D1 mAb, indicating that the 10D1-responsible thymocytes were of CD4+8- phenotype. This 10D1 mAb-induced thymocyte proliferation was perfectly dependent on the endogenous IL-2/IL-2R system since a complete inhibition was observed with anti-IL-2 and anti-IL-2R mAb. The proliferating CD4 single positive thymocytes predominantly expressed the IL-2R alpha (p55) but not a detectable level of the IL-2R beta (p75). These results indicate that, although the 10D1 Ag can be detected on the CD7+2+3-4-8- thymocytes, its functional expression is restricted to a minor more mature CD4+ thymocyte population as well as in peripheral blood T cells, and the implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Inhibition of lysis occurs when cis FFA is added before or within 10 min after CTL-target cell conjugate formation and thus appears to interfere with lethal hit delivery. Our previous studies have shown that similar treatment with cis FFA inhibits, in CTL, the Ag stimulated increase in intracellular calcium and degranulation, suggesting that inhibition of lysis probably results from perturbation of the CTL signaling pathway. However, inhibition of lysis is probably not due to the inhibition of the rise in intracellular calcium or degranulation, because lysis can occur under conditions in which FFA inhibit degranulation and because cis FFA inhibit calcium-independent killing. Inhibition of lysis is detectable at unbound FFA concentrations less than 1 microM and is generally complete at concentrations less than 5 microM. Although these levels of FFA are somewhat higher than reported for normal physiologic conditions, plasma FFA levels can be elevated into this range in states of stress and disease, suggesting that FFA modulation of the immune response has important physiologic consequences.\r"

This report focuses on the role of different lymphocyte populations in this activation. The central role of CD4+ T cells in the proliferation response has been established by different sets of experiments. The phenotypic characterization of splenic lymphocytes before and after the co-culture showed that the only cell type present in higher number after the co-culture than before is the CD4+ T cell. When CD4+ cells were purified by flow microfluorimetry and co-cultured with SM a strong proliferative response was detected. In contrast, purified CD8+ cells in co-culture with SM cells did not proliferate. The activation of CD4+ cells by SM required direct cell-to-cell contact and could be detected on the fourth day, reaching maximal levels at the 6th and 7th days of the co-culture. The activation is more pronounced in the syngeneic system than under allogeneic conditions and is inhibited by anti-MHC II mAb, but not by anti-MHC II mAb. The finding that vascular smooth muscle cells can activate syngeneic T cells may have important implications concerning the mechanism of induction of vasculitis.\r"

BALB/c mice received s.c. injections with capsaicin (100 mg/kg) and tested 1 to 2 wk later exhibited insensitivity to chemically induced irritation (greater than 80% reduction in the eye-wiping response for more than 15 wk) as well as loss (greater than 95% reduction) of the ear swelling response to topical capsaicin. Early (less than or equal to 4 h) ear swelling to topical DNFB and oxazolone was also markedly reduced by capsaicin pretreatment, suggesting neurogenic inflammation as a major component of the early irritant reaction to haptens. In contrast, capsaicin-pretreated mice exhibited enhanced contact sensitivity (CS) reactions to oxazolone (greater than 90%) and DNFB (greater than 50%) and enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to SRBC (greater than 20%). Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that CS augmentation was not due to generation of increased numbers and/or activity of effector T cells. Histologic studies as well as experiments measuring migration of 51Cr-labeled, Ag-nonspecific cells showed increased edema and enhanced cell localization in CS elicitation sites in capsaicin-pretreated mice. These results indicate that peptidergic neurons, via neuropeptide release, regulate the expression of T cell-mediated, delayed-in-time, cutaneous inflammatory reactions. The net effect of these neurons on the late (cellular) phase of such responses seems to be suppressive, because their impairment results in augmented reactions.\r"

  ".U": "90338742\r", 
  ".W": "Studies were undertaken to assess the effect of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in two different models involving injection of parental cells into F1 hosts. In both of these systems, MCMV-induced enhancement of hybrid resistance was found. In the first model, parent-into-F1 graft-vs-host reaction, MCMV infection of (C57BL/6 x C3H)F1 (B6C3F1) hosts was found to prevent the GVHR normally induced by injection of B6 parental splenocytes into the F1 hosts. The second model involved injection of parental bone marrow into lethally irradiated B6C3F1 and (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 (B6D2F1) hosts. These irradiated hosts are known to exhibit resistance to engraftment by parental C57BL/6 (B6) bone marrow. This resistance was found to be markedly enhanced by injection of the hosts with MCMV 3 days before irradiation and bone marrow injection. In contrast, engraftment into B6C3F1 hosts of syngeneic marrow, or bone marrow from the C3H parent, was not affected by MCMV infection. Engraftment of DBA/2 marrow into B6D2F1 hosts was reduced at lower doses of injected marrow, suggesting enhanced resistance against the minor Hh Ag Hh-DBA. To test whether the MCMV-induced enhancement of resistance was mediated by NK cells, splenic NK activity (YAC-1 killing) and frequency (NK1.1 staining) were assessed. Both parameters were found to be elevated at 3 days after MCMV infection but to return to normal levels by 9 days. B6 bone marrow engraftment was in fact found to be normal when the marrow was administered to F1 mice 9 days after MCMV infection. Furthermore, anti-asialoGM1 administration prevented MCMV-induced enhancement of resistance to marrow engraftment. Thus, the NK enhancement resulting from MCMV infection appears to play a major role in the enhanced HR observed in the marrow engraftment model. This effect may be of importance in clinical bone marrow transplantation, a situation in which patients are susceptible to viral infection.\r"

  ".W": "Utilizing a sensitive and selective assay for IL-4, it was shown that lymph node T cells from naive mice could produce small amounts of this lymphokine in response to anti-CD3 antibodies adsorbed to culture dishes. The capacity of these cells to produce IL-4 in response to plate-bound anti-CD3 was substantially enhanced by the addition of IL-2 to the culture and was strikingly inhibited by monoclonal anti-IL-2 antibody. Thus, IL-2 appears to be essential for IL-4 production by anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated T cells from naive mice. The effect of IL-2 was not mediated either by preferential proliferation or survival of precursors of IL-4 producing cells, indicating that IL-2 regulates T cell production of IL-4. IL-4 producing capacity of T cells from naive mice was found mainly among CD4+ T cells. Large T cells produced much more IL-4, on a per cell basis, than did small T cells. In contrast, small T cells appeared to be equal or superior to large T cells in producing IL-2. The superiority of large T cells in IL-4-producing capacity was not accounted for by a lack of an accessory cell population from the small T cells as addition of large spleen cells depleted of both B and T cells did not enhance IL-4 production by small lymph node T cells. These results suggest that the bulk of IL-4 production by T cell populations, from normal mice, in response to anti-CD3 depends upon cells that are already activated and that IL-2 is required for such production.\r"

  ".W": "As previous experiments have shown that IL-2 activity is abrogated by cAMP, its effect on IL-2R expression by normal and leukemic T lymphocytes was evaluated in detail. The exposure of murine or human T cells to dibutyryl cAMP or the cAMP-elevating drug, forskolin, resulted in a decrease in high affinity IL-2 binding. Equilibrium binding analyses revealed that elevation of cAMP for 4 to 5 h produced a 40 to 50% decrease in the number of detectable receptors, whereas the affinity of the IL-2R interaction remained unchanged. The effect of cAMP could be attributed to a selective effect on the 75-kDa chain of the IL-2R (p75) subunit of the 55-kDa chain of the IL-2R/p75 heterodimer. The mechanism for the decreased expression of high affinity IL-2R appears to be due to a dual effect of cAMP, which functions to both increase the rate of IL-2R internalization, and to decrease the rate of expression of new receptors. Moreover, the effect of cAMP on IL-2 binding to p75 subunits is post-transcriptional, because the steady state levels of p75 mRNA expression are not altered within a time interval that produced nearly a 50% reduction in p75 binding.\r"

In contrast to the effect it exerts on normal B cells, IL-4 does not promote DNA synthesis by B-CLL lymphocytes. Rather this interleukin inhibits the response to IL-2 in all patients' cells that responded to this interleukin. We thus examined whether IL-4 would modulate the number and/or the affinity of IL-2 receptors. A 3-day activation of cells by anti-microAb induced a few hundred high affinity IL-2 receptors (HA-IL-2R) on B-CLL cell surface, as determined by Scatchard analysis. Treatment of cells with IL-4 caused a marked decrease in the number of HA-IL-2R without interfering with the binding ability of IL-2. In contrast with this profound suppressive effect, IL-4 did not down-regulate the expression of each chain, alpha and beta (p55 and p75, respectively), of the HA-IL-2R heterodimer. In fact, the expression of alpha and beta induced by anti-microAb was enhanced by IL-4. Altogether, IL-4 exerts a critical influence on the function and the configuration of HA-IL-2R without inhibiting the expression of two subunits, alpha and beta.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that sulfated polyanions (SP) are potent inhibitors of HIV infection in vitro, appearing to inhibit virus attachment. To understand the mode of action of these compounds a large panel of SP were examined for their ability to inhibit HIV infection, block anti-CD4 mAb binding and, when immobilized, bind soluble CD4 and virion gp120. Based on anti-CD4 mAb binding-inhibition studies a SP binding site was identified on the CD4 molecule. Dextran sulfate (DXS)-500 kDa, polyvinylsulfate (PVS), and polyanethole sulfonate were particularly potent SP inhibitors, blocking the binding of 11 of the 12 anti-CD4 mAb tested. These 11 mAb are known to interact with the two amino-terminal Ig-like domains of CD4. In fact, DXS-500 kDa exhibited an hierarchy of inhibition of anti-CD4 mAb which suggests that SP bind to a conformational site incorporating the first two Ig-like domains of CD4. This SP binding site is clearly distinct but closely associated with the gp120 binding region of CD4. In terms of anti-HIV activity there was no evidence that SP act at the virion level as rgp120 did not bind to immobilized SP and preincubation of virions with SP did not affect infectivity. In contrast, many of the SP tested showed some affinity for CD4 based on anti-CD4 mAb blocking studies and binding of soluble CD4 to immobilized SP. The most active in this regard were DXS-500 kDa and PVS, whose anti-HIV activity could be entirely due to disruption of the CD4-gp120 interaction. However, with SP such as heparin, fucoidan, the carrageenans, and polyanethole sulfonate, although CD4 blocking may contribute to anti-HIV activity, some other anti-viral mechanism is also operating. Finally, pentosan sulfate, a SP with anti-HIV activity comparable to DXS-500 kDa and PVS, showed little or no reactivity with CD4 and must inhibit HIV infection by a totally CD4-independent mechanism.\r"

In addition, the intracellular histamine content in both hematopoietic organs is concomitantly increased. A similar injection of worm Ag into normal mice has no significant effect. Comparable enhancement of HDC activity and intracellular histamine content with almost identical kinetics is promoted by i.v. injection of rIL-3 into normal mice. Moreover, HDC levels in infected mice are increased to the same extent in response to either specific antigen or rIL-3 injection. Taken together these results support the conclusion that antigenic challenge of immunized mice induces endogeneous IL-3 which, in turn, promotes a rapid increase in histamine synthesis in hematopoietic organs.\r"

Data obtained with cAMP analogs known to act synergistically to stimulate protein kinase A suggested that the latter directly mediated endonuclease activation. Agents previously shown to stimulate protein kinase C and to inhibit Ca2(+)-dependent, TCR-mediated thymocyte apoptosis, including IL-1, also blocked both DNA fragmentation and cell death in response to cAMP, suggesting interactions (\"cross-talk\") between the two protein kinase systems.

Its mechanism of action is unknown, but the presence of osteoblasts was shown to be necessary for IL-1 stimulation of bone resorption by isolated osteoclasts. This study examines the presence of IL-1R and IL-1 effects in osteoblastic cells from a clonal human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2/B-10. We found that the binding affinity and the number of binding sites increases substantially during the postconfluent stage. Scatchard and curve-fitting analysis revealed one class of high affinity binding sites, with Kd/Ki's of 40 +/- 17 pM (mean +/- SD) for IL-1 alpha (n = 5) and 9 +/- 7 pM for IL-1 beta (n = 5) and 2916 +/- 2438 (n = 6) receptors/cell. Incubation of the cells with 125I-IL-1 alpha (100 pM) at 4 degrees C, followed by incubation at 37 degrees C up to 4 h, revealed internalization of receptor-bound IL-1 alpha. Chemical cross-linking studies showed that the IL-1R in Saos-2/B-10 cells had a molecular mass of approximately 80 kDa. To assess the biologic effect of IL-1 in Saos-2/B-10 cells, we determined PGE2 content and adenylate cyclase activity. Although IL-1 had no effect on PGE2 synthesis, both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta enhanced PGE2 stimulation of adenylate cyclase two- to four-fold in a dose-dependent manner. The half-maximal effect for IL-1 alpha was seen at 8 to 10 pM and for IL-1 beta at 0.6 to 1.8 pM. IL-1 did not enhance basal adenylate cyclase or stimulation by parathyroid hormone, isoproterenol, or forskolin. IL-1 enhancement of PGE2-stimulated adenylate cyclase was detected between 1 to 2 h, was maximal at 4 to 5 h, was not prevented by cycloheximide treatment, and was seen in membranes from IL-1 pretreated cells. These data show effects of IL-1 on a human osteoblast-like cell line that are mediated by high affinity receptors. These IL-1 effects could contribute to the biologic action of IL-1 on bone.\r"

In Caucasian populations, the 10.5-kb fragment is present in 64 to 72% of haplotypes. The polymorphic NcoI site is located within the first intron of the TNF-beta gene. Additional restriction fragment variability was demonstrated by digestion with AccI; however, this restriction fragment variability was not allelic in nature. Rather, it was a consequence of variable DNA methylation at AccI sites within and upstream of the TNF-beta gene. In peripheral blood leukocytes, methylation of the TNF-beta AccI sites was greatest in neutrophils (TNF-beta nonproducers), and lowest in T lymphocytes (the major producers of TNF-beta). These results suggest strongly that variation in DNA methylation may play an important role in regulation of the expression of the TNF-beta gene.\r"

Because embryonic cells are growth factor responsive and maintain high proliferative rates, we examined the requirement for growth factor-initiated proliferation for NK susceptibility. Murine embryonic fibroblasts made quiescent in defined medium lacking growth factors were relatively resistant to NK cytolysis. However, reinitiation of proliferation with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or epidermal growth factor enhanced lysis in a dose-dependent fashion. TGF-beta, which blocked cell division, did not enhance cytotoxicity. Additionally, growth inhibition by prolonged incubation at confluence suppressed lysis. The enhanced NK cytotoxicity of bFGF-stimulated fibroblasts was caused by a post-binding event because no difference in cold target inhibition could be demonstrated with bFGF-treated cells. NK cytotoxicity has largely been attributed to the action of cytotoxins released from cytoplasmic granules. In a 51Cr release assay, bFGF-treated fibroblasts were insensitive to NK granules isolated from the RNK large granular lymphocyte leukemia. However, these same cells exhibited marked sensitivity to lysis in an 18-h adhesion assay normally utilized to detect TNF-alpha. With the use of this assay, a dose-dependent increase in sensitivity of bFGF-treated fibroblasts was observed, whereas quiescent fibroblasts were resistant to the action of isolated NK granules. Granule cytotoxicity was not caused by cytolysin/perforin because inactivation of granule hemolytic activity with CaCl2 did not affect fibroblast killing, and bFGF-treated cells were insensitive to purified cytolysin/perforin. This suggested that another granule associated cytotoxin was responsible for enhanced NK sensitivity of actively proliferating fibroblasts.\r"

Expression of GST-pi mRNA in human skin, cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and disorders of squamous hyperplasia was demonstrated by Northern blotting and in situ hybridization. Human epidermal and placental cDNA clones hybridized to the same genomic DNA fragments. Hybridization of placental cDNA to interspecific somatic cell hybrids showed retention of chromosome 11, confirming the assignment of GST 3 to the long arm of chromosome 11 by molecular means. Anti-GST-pi antibody did not give a basement membrane zone pattern, although some normal and BP sera contained antibodies to GST-pi.

Their role in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata (AA) and universalis (AU) has not been explored. This study is an investigation of the function of peripheral blood monocytes from normal subjects and patients with AA, AU, and alopecia totalis (AT), with respect to the principal macrophage-derived angiogenic factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Because neovascularization is a necessary component in the anagen phase of hair growth and may play a role in the pathology of these disorders, we asked whether monocyte/macrophage angiogenic activity was compromised in these alopecias. Purified preparations of monocytes were activated in culture. Conditioned media were assessed for angiogenic activity on the chick chorioallantoic membrane and for concentration of TNF alpha by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both angiogenic and the TNF concentration were significantly diminished in conditioned media from AU monocytes when compared to those from normal subjects and patients with AA. These results show that the function of AU monocytes may be abnormal and that the abnormality may distinguish AU from AA. Defective monocyte/macrophage function could also play a pathogenic role via effects on neovascularization and/or modulation of the immune response.\r"

Cells in human skin have been reported to contain a photoreactivation repair mechanism that, following exposure to UVA or visible light, repairs UVB-induced pyrimidine dimers. The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to photoreactivating light would also reverse the UVB-induced morphologic alterations in human Langerhans cells. The skin of eight healthy volunteers was exposed to a low dose of UVB radiation (between 0.75 and 1.5 times the minimal erythema dose), and immediately thereafter exposed to photoreactivating light from either BLB fluorescent lamps (UVA radiation) or incandescent bulbs (visible light). After exposure to UVB radiation, the number of ATPase+ epidermal Langerhans cells was reduced in all subjects to between 21% and 65% of that in unirradiated skin, and the majority of the remaining cells exhibited morphologic alterations. Exposure of the UVB-irradiated skin to photoreactivating light did not reverse or reduce these effects. We conclude that UVB-induced morphologic alterations of human Langerhans cells are not subject to photoreactivation. These results imply either that pyrimidine dimers are not involved in these effects of UVB irradiation, or that photoreactivation does not occur in human Langerhans cells in situ.\r"

Endothelial cell gaps were found in postcapillary venules and capillaries, but only in association with an increased deposition of basement membrane-like material in the vascular wall. In parallel with the increased amounts of deposited basement membrane-like material, the space between pericytes and endothelial cells was wider and the cytoplasmic processes that formed the contact points between them were longer and thinner than normal. Pericytes, devoid of any cytoplasmic contacts with the underlying endothelial cells, were observed as isolated cells within the outer third of the vascular wall in markedly thickened vessels. These observations offer an explanation for the known increased vascular permeability of diabetic vessels, and suggest a possible explanation for the development of diabetic retinopathy with aneurysm formation.\r"

The other two Spitz nevi had a few polyploid cells with the major population of cells containing diploid DNA content. In contrast, all malignant melanomas showed an aneuploid DNA distribution histographic pattern. The DNA index values of cells from Spitz nevi distributed in the similar range to that of acquired pigmented nevi and separated from those of malignant melanomas distributed in a much higher range. Our results suggest that cytofluorometric analysis of cellular DNA content reflects the biologic behavior more sensitively than do conventional clinical or histologic criteria, and that it serves as a useful aid for the differentiation of Spitz nevus from malignant melanoma.\r"

By scanning electron microscopy, the plucked hairs showed a typical moniliform feature composed of alternated nodes and internodes. By computer stereography, reconstructed three-dimensional models of in vivo hair structures showed that the diameter of hair shaft was partially reduced in the keratogenous zone and that the reduction was severe in the hair cortex and cuticle layers but mild in the inner root sheath. By transmission electron microscopy, a significant degeneration of hair matrix cells was found, and a zig-zag disarray of cortical tonofibrils and invaginations of the hair cuticle cells into the cortex were noticed in the suprabulbar portion. In some hairs, the hair bulbs showed no degeneration, but a degeneration of cortical cells and invaginations of hair cuticle were seen in some portions in the developing zone of the cortex. This suggests that not every hair matrix is damaged in a synchronized fashion, but individual hairs are affected independently. Furthermore, in all the hair and hair follicles examined, cytoplasmic vacuolations were always seen in the various layers, and abnormal formation of tonofibrils was often observed in the cortex. In monilethrix, a cell abnormality may inherently be present in the hair tissue and, when such abnormality occurs severely, the cortical cells are particularly affected in the hair matrix. This seems to result in a decrease in number of cortical cells and thinning of the hair shaft.\r"

Repair tissue was quantitated histomorphometrically in full-thickness wounds covered with SAM or left air-exposed for periods up to 3 weeks. Early in healing, mouse wounds left open to the atmosphere formed a scab which overlay a large volume of granulation tissue derived from two sources, one lateral, and the other deep and centrally located. In contrast, SAM-covered wounds contained only a small amount of granulation tissue which was derived solely from lateral sources. Granulation tissue was replaced by fibrous connective tissue over time, and this was always less in SAM-covered wounds. Deposition of large amounts of connective tissue in air-exposed wounds was associated with significant polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltrates, while the lack of granulation tissue formation in SAM-covered sites was associated with reduced inflammation. Dressing-induced inhibition of connective tissue could be partially reversed by treatment with transforming growth factor-beta form 1 or 2. Deposition of granulation tissue in large lenticular wounds in guinea pig skin, but not in 6-mm punch wounds, was also inhibited when the wounds were covered with SAM, and the morphology of air-exposed and SAM-covered wounds was similar to that in mice. SAM-covered wounds in mice and guinea pigs may be useful as models of chronic non-healing wounds.\r"

Through selective disruption of the epithelial-mesenchymal interface, we investigate whether the specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) of the dermal papilla and basement membrane zone (BMZ) serves a crucial function in hair follicle EMI. Epithelial bulbs incubated intact within their follicular sheaths incorporate thymidine primarily into cells of the hair matrix and outer root sheath, as shown by autoradiography. However, after removal of its mesenchymal associations (dermal papilla and extrabulbar connective tissue), the epithelial bulb showed no incorporation. Neither externally added collagen (type I or IV) nor the basement membrane components in Matrigel could substitute for the growth supporting influence of native surrounding stroma. Mechanical separation of the bulb from the dermal papilla in the basement membrane zone inhibited thymidine incorporation by the epithelium even though mesenchyme was still in close proximity. Enzymatic digestion of the dermal papilla ECM and the basal lamina by Dispase, a fibronectinase and type IV collagenase, also inhibited bulb growth without evidence of cytotoxicity. These experiments suggest that direct epithelial to mesenchymal contact is required for the support of follicular epithelial growth in vitro and that specific ECM components, possibly fibronectin and/or type IV collagen, rather than diffusable factors alone, play a crucial role in the mechanism of hair follicle EMI. The in vitro system described here provides an alternative to developmental EMI models and may serve as a valuable tool for studying EMI in the adult mammalian organism.\r"

In this study the temperature induced phase transitions and corresponding lipid domain reorganization in isolated stratum corneum (SC) sheets and SC membrane complexes (SCM) were determined using the electron spin resonance (ESR) spin probe technique. The spin probe perdeuterated di-tert-butyl nitroxide (pdDTBN) in SC and SCM revealed less well-defined physiologic phase transitions in the SCM and a more polar lipid domain in SC. However, the ESR results show the coexistence of highly ordered domains (immobilized spin probe) and less viscous domains in intact SC, which persist in SCM. Above approximately 20 degrees C the spin probe is dissolved in a highly disordered (isotropic) lipid domain in both SC and SCM. In both solvent extracted SC and SCM, the spin probe is dissolved in a highly ordered lipophilic domain associated with the lipids complexed to the corneocyte envelope and exhibiting no thermal transitions between -23 degrees to 60 degrees C. Further, the amount of mobile spin probe is related to the amount of residual lipid. An unexpected finding was the apparent reduction of the spin probe in solvent extracted SCM, suggesting the presence of a previously unrecognized free radical reducing mechanism in these sites. The mobilities of the spin probe when dissolved in model lipids, non-hydroxy, and hydroxy containing ceramides and cholesteryl oleate, differed significantly from those observed in SC or SCM. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of ESR for the localization and characterization of lipid microenvironments in the stratum corneum.\r"

In two further cases, the fallopian tubes proved impossible to cannulate, and along with two instances where difficulty was experienced, a common underlying feature was an arcuate or septate configuration of the uterus. Three pregnancies ensued (17%) in cases where the procedure was free of difficulty and the transfers were demonstrably intratubal: two went to term and the third resulted in an ectopic pregnancy. The procedure has so far not shown a benefit over conventional IVF-ET and probably should be avoided in women with any type of tubal disorder.\r"

Oocytes that formed two or three pronuclei following first insemination always exhibited positive lectin staining similar to that observed with in vitro fertilized mouse oocytes. Among those oocytes that failed to form any pronuclei after the first insemination attempt, only 5% contained lectin positive substances in the perivitelline space. Upon reinsemination, a higher percentage of those oocytes produced lectin-positive materials, although pronuclei were still absent. The appearance of fucosyl glycoconjugates in these oocytes might be the result of the release of cortical granules triggered by sperm penetration or, more likely, due to spontaneous granule discharge in senescent oocytes.\r"

Of six oocytes microinjected, one exhibited two normal pronuclei and two polar bodies and was subsequently transferred to a fallopian tube of the wife. One oocyte arrested at syngamy, while two additional oocytes cleaved to four cells each. The remaining two were damaged during microinjection. Although the patient did not conceive, this report provides evidence that (1) spermatozoal motility is not required for successful pronuclear formation when microinjection is performed, and such immotile sperm are not necessarily \"dead,\" and (2) this further corroborates that caput epididymal spermatozoa can participate in the subzonal events of fertilization and that, in the human, exposure of spermatozoa to the distal epididymal milieu may not be a requisite to achieve fertilizing capacity.\r"

The present study was carried out to determine the incidence of Trichomonas infection in semen samples of asymptomatic men and also to understand the changes of semen characteristics in the infected individuals before treatment and after treatment with metronidazole (Flagyl, 400 mg x 3x a day for 10 days). The semen obtained from 1131 men was examined for different characteristics and Trichomonas were detected in wet smear preparations in 50 cases (4.42%). The characteristics of semen in them was compared with 52 normal semen samples. Statistical analysis showed that the seminal fluid viscosity and percentage particulate debris was increased significantly in the infected group (P less than 0.001). There was no significant change in the pH of semen. Spermatozoan motility and morphologically normal forms were decreased significantly (P less than 0.001), spermatozoan viability was altered, and there was a significant change in membrane integrity (P less than 0.001) as indicated by the hypoosmotic swelling test. The significant improvement in semen characteristics were seen in 25 cases after a single course of treatment. Therefore, it is possible that in some cases, the infertility seen in asymptomatic individuals may be due to infection by Trichomonas.\r"

This was done using immunoradiometric assays for hCG, manufactured either by Serono Diagnostics Ltd. (MAIAclone) or Diagnostics Products Corporation (IRMA-count). The analysis of 63 serum samples by both kits showed a good correlation (r = 0.99) but the Serono (y) method gave values which were consistently greater (y = 1.58x + 4.89) than those of the DPC (x) method. A comparison of the hCG profile of singleton pregnancies measured with either the Serono (n = 33) or DPC (n = 22) kits gave a similar relationship. These results suggest that great care must be taken when comparing results from different laboratories using different kits. Also, consideration must be given to the possible loss of a continuous database should a laboratory change kit.\r"

Those choosing out-of-hospital birth (OHB) were a self-selected group of highly motivated couples interested in natural childbirth or desiring to minimize the cost of pregnancy care. Of 790 singleton pregnancies followed to term, 71 (9.0%) planned home births, 510 (64.6%) planned clinic births, and 209 (26.5%) planned hospital births. Of those planning clinic or home birth, 73% gave birth outside the hospital as planned (44 at home and 379 in the clinic), 81 (14%) changed plans prenatally and gave birth in a local hospital, 46 (8%) were transferred to the local hospital intrapartum, and 29 (5%) were referred to tertiary care. Primiparas who initially chose OHB were more likely than multiparas to give birth in a hospital (46% vs 16%). Controlling retrospectively for obstetric risk and parity, there were few differences in outcome between local hospital and out-of-hospital births. The observed rates of serious complications for OHB were low, but overall, 27% of those initially considered candidates for birth outside the hospital required a change to a higher level of care. For primiparas initially planning clinic or home birth, discriminant analysis revealed five variables that together might have improved the prediction of the eventual decision for hospital delivery in 46%. Clinical pelvimetry was the most powerful variable, in keeping with the finding that most intrapartum transfers were for arrests of labor. The results also suggest that financial factors and other features of the physician-patient relationship influenced clinical decision making.\r"

Three family practices of comparable size (one faculty practice and two community small-group practices) participated in the study. A random sample of 450 adult patients (150 from each site) was drawn from patient logs using a time series sampling method. Charts were reviewed for serum lipid evaluations, documentation of coronary heart disease risk factors, lipid-lowering activities, and other coronary heart disease risk-factor interventions. Sixty-seven percent of the sample had cholesterol measures recorded. No differences were found in the rates of measurement for men and women. Multiple, detailed serum lipid evaluations were common, and recognition of high cholesterol as a problem even before 1980 was apparent. Almost one half (47%) of individuals with cholesterol greater than 5.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) had a charted intervention, 64% if cholesterol greater than 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL). Diet was the most common intervention (73%), and medication was used in only eight cases. Nonpharmaceutical interventions appeared to be undercharted. An analysis of interpractice variations revealed strikingly consistent results, although some interesting differences were noted. These rates are at least double previously reported rates and suggest that primary care physicians play a major role in this national priority.\r"

Few elderly men of lower socioeconomic background have been included in these studies, however. Using physician-administered interviews, 87 men attending an urban Veterans Administration geriatric clinic were studied to determine (1) the prevalence of erectile dysfunction, and (2) the sexual practices and attitudes of this group. Of the 87 men, 28% reported complete loss of erectile function, while 31% had frequent difficulties achieving vaginal intromission. Unlike economically advantaged groups, only 29% used mutual masturbation and 16% used oral sex. Attitudes toward these practices were negative. With one exception, men unable to perform coitus ceased all heterosexual activities.\r"

A particularly strong reluctance was found among physicians to divulge information to other physicians. More physicians appeared willing to disclose information to relatives of the patient without their consent.

Implementing a family medicine residency training program for these skills requires identifying a faculty facilitator to consider the issues of time, cost, caseload, reimbursement, specialist support, personal training, and office impact related to this training. Experience with teaching these skills in a community-based family practice residency indicates that startup costs range from $10,000 to $20,000. Residents will initially require from 30 to 60 minutes to provide a complete examination. All procedures require precepting by trained faculty and adherence to established protocol. The most frequent indications for these procedures include evaluating the abnormal Papanicolaou smear, visible cervical abnormalities, or evidence of clinical papillomavirus infection in either sex. Experience suggests that over 90% of cervical dysplasia can be managed entirely in the residency outpatient setting. These procedures have become the most common outpatient procedures performed, surpassing all others combined. Referrals to the residency for these procedures are readily available. Strategies for developing curriculum, literature review, learning materials, and training workshops are presented. Colposcopy, androscopy, and cryotherapy are appropriate additions to the training curriculum of family practice residencies.\r"

After control for sociodemographic factors and preexisting psychiatric conditions, the risk for onset of self-reported delusions or hallucinations was observed to be greater for daily users of marijuana or cocaine and for users of anxiolytics or sympathomimetics compared with nonusers. After control for daily cocaine use and alcohol disorder, the risk of onset of psychotic experiences for daily users of marijuana was double that for nonusers. Alcohol disorder in men was associated with eightfold risk and in women with threefold risk. Baseline depressive episodes, manic episodes, agoraphobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder also were associated with increased risk of onset of psychotic experiences.\r"

  ".W": "The primary objective of this study was to determine whether cognitive functioning at intake into treatment was associated with completion of a 30-day day hospital alcoholism rehabilitation program and 1- and 6-month posttreatment functioning. None of our measures of sociodemographic characteristics, cognitive functioning, and life functioning was found to be significantly correlated with program completion. The measures of cognitive functioning included four cognitive factors--language ability, auditory verbal learning, logical memory, and complex cognitive functioning--as well as an objective measure of within-treatment learning. Canonical correlation analyses were performed to estimate associations among 14 independent variables and seven measures of both 1- and 6-month follow-up outcomes. The independent variables included the five cognitive measures described above, race and age, and seven baseline Addiction Severity Index (ASI) interviewer ratings of severity of alcohol, drug, family/social, legal, medical, employment, and psychological/psychiatric problem levels. The dependent variables at each follow-up evaluation point consisted of the difference between the baseline and follow-up ASI composite (factor) scores in the seven areas of functioning described above. The findings revealed the relative independence of improvement in alcohol problem level at both followup periods, as contrasted with the relative interdependence of the other areas of functioning. Greater baseline alcohol problems and poorer complex cognitive functioning were most consistently associated with improved alcohol-related outcome. Other cognitive measures ere not significantly associated with treatment outcome in the other areas of functioning described above.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This paper reports the results of a pilot study of the lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a group of nonalcoholic men with multigenerational family histories of alcoholism (high-risk) in comparison with that of a control group (nonalcoholic men without multigenerational family histories of alcoholism). Diagnoses were given following the structured interview format of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, using the Research Diagnostic Criteria. The prevalence of psychopathology in the probands' first- and second-degree relatives was also determined using the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria. The results showed a higher lifetime prevalence of psychopathology for the high-risk men compared with control subjects, with the diagnoses of major affective disorder and anxiety disorder predominating. In addition, the data obtained from first- and second-degree relatives indicated a significantly higher prevalence of nonalcoholic diagnoses in the high-risk families (depression in particular), suggesting that alcoholism and depression may be cosegregating in these families. The lifetime prevalence of these disorders is similar to that reported in chronic alcoholics.\r"

  ".U": "90339001\r", 
  ".W": "\"Adult children of alcoholics\" (COAs) has become a popular diagnostic categorization denoting a group of adults sharing a common environmental background. These individuals are felt to share common familial effects of early development in an \"alcoholic\" home. The COA concept has gained significant acceptance in the popular press with many substance abuse treatment centers developing programmed treatment approaches for Adult COAs. However, little research evidence is available to validate this diagnosis. To evaluate the validity of the Adult COA concept among patients in treatment for substance abuse, we compared a series of patients for a variety of demographic, personality, psychiatric illness, and substance abuse phenomenology measures. The results of this comparison showed few distinctions in phenomenology between the two groups. The COA group reported more specific problem-drinking behaviors and medical problems related to alcohol as well as a higher total alcoholism severity score. This study finds only limited support for the validity of the diagnosis of Adult COA in a distinct inpatient substance abuse population.\r"

We report here on the psychometric equivalence of a Spanish language adaptation (PANSS-S), developed to facilitate minority group, multinational, and cross-cultural studies on schizophrenia. Two bilingual psychiatrists simultaneously rated 57 psychiatric inpatients using the PANSS (N = 20), PANSS-S (N = 20), or both methods (N = 17). The PANSS-S demonstrated sound interrater reliabilities (r = .93 for positive and .74 for negative syndrome, p less than .001), which were similar to those from the current PANSS assessment and original standardization studies. In support of criterion-related validity, the means and variance of the two instruments were comparable, and significant cross-correlations were obtained for the principal scales (r = .92 for positive and .83 for negative syndrome, p less than .0001), component symptoms, and five additional psychopathology clusters. The results suggest that the PANSS-S has psychometric properties resembling those of the PANSS and may be used interchangeably in a Spanish-speaking population.\r"

When patients were grouped according to their performance on the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery (LNNB), a distinct subgroup of six patients emerged. These patients failed to perform neuropsychological testing, due to their inability to fulfill the instructions, despite often repeated full explanations of the test procedures; four of these patients had enlarged lateral ventricles and all met operational criteria for Kraepelin's dementia praecox. Two other patients subgroups were categorized as LNNB normal and abnormal. These two subgroups showed lesser brain abnormalities and lower negative symptom scores than the former.\r"

A canonical correlation of .53 (28% of variance) indicated that those who responded to stressful life events with self-blame, wishful thinking, and avoidance tended to be more symptomatic 4 months later. In a regression analysis, avoidant coping significantly contributed to the prediction of psychological disturbance at the time of the second interview (R2 = .22, p less than .05). Coping strategy, however, did not significantly contribute to the prediction of physical health status during the interval examined. These results are generally consistent with the notion that coping strategies modulate the influence of life events on health and well-being but underscore the possibility that such relationships may differ depending on whether physical or psychological health status is being predicted.\r"

The prognostic importance of age, performance status, tumour location, extent of surgery and radiation treatment was studied. Radiation therapy gave a significant improvement in survival in both AA (p less than 0.003) and GM (p less than 0.002), but was given only to patients in a good neurological condition. Both younger age (p less than 0.003), and good preoperative performance status (p less than 0.002) were associated with a longer survival in AA, but not in GM. Extensive surgery was correlated with a better immediate postoperative performance, a lower one-month mortality rate and a longer survival, in both AA and GM. There was no relationship between preoperative neurological function status and the extent of surgery. Because of the retrospective nature of this study, the conclusion is that performing extensive surgery instead of limited surgery does not lead to more deterioration in postoperative neurological function.\r"

A range of problems were reported by both patients and their partners. These were, in turn, associated with a range of variables relating to the disease, psychological and social factors.

It has been argued that VFD typically exacerbates the behavioural manifestations of neglect. We examined a series of 51 patients with unilateral right-hemisphere stroke for the presence of visual field deficit and visuo-spatial neglect. Patients were assigned to the neglect group (N+) or the non-neglect group (N-) on the basis of their aggregate scores on the recently standardised Behavioural Inattention Test (BIT). The association between neglect and VFD was confirmed. Four groups of eight patients (N+, VFD+; N+, VFD-; N-, VFD+; N-, VFD-) were then selected from the initial sample so that they were matched for age, IQ, and days post onset of stroke. Within the neglect groups, the severity of neglect did not differ significantly between those patients with and without VFD; within the non-neglect groups, scores on subtests of the BIT likewise did not differ (with the sole exception of Letter Cancellation) between the VFD+ and the VFD- subgroups. It was concluded that visual field deficits do not exacerbate neglect, and that poor functional recovery in many patients with VFDs is due to the association of sensory loss with the underlying causal factor of neglect.\r"

The animals were anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. Hyperthermia was induced with 2,4-dinitrophenol (5 mg/kg) injected intravenously in 5 dogs. It was found that the best and earliest predictor of approaching hyperthermia was the increase in oxygen consumption, which increased 10% in 1.72 min. Mean blood pressure was an insensitive indicator of approaching hyperthermia. Rectal temperature, not surprisingly, was found to be a late and undependable early indicator of developing hyperthermia, requiring about 15 minutes to exhibit a definite increase. It is concluded that among these indicators, monitoring oxygen consumption (ml/min) is the most reliable way to identify a metabolic change such as incipient hyperthermia.\r"

  ".W": "Competing technologies exist for measuring oxygen concentrations in breathing circuits. Over a 4-year period, two types of oxygen analyzers were studied prospectively in routine clinical use to determine the incidence and nature of malfunctions. Newer AC-powered galvanic analyzers (North American Drager O2med) were compared with older, battery-powered polarographic analyzers (Ohmeda 201) by recording all failures and necessary repairs. The AC-powered galvanic analyzer had a significantly lower incidence of failures (0.12 +/- 0.04 failures per machine-month) than the battery-powered polarographic analyzer (4.0 +/- 0.3 failures per machine-month). Disposable capsules containing the active galvanic cells lasted 12 +/- 7 months. Although the galvanic analyzers tended to remain out of service longer, awaiting the arrival of costly parts, the polarographic analyzers were more expensive to keep operating when calculations included the cost of time spent on repairs. Stocking galvanic capsules would have decreased the amount of time the galvanic analyzers were out of service, while increasing costs. In conclusion, galvanic oxygen analyzers appear capable of delivering more reliable service at a lower overall cost. By keeping the galvanic capsules exposed to room air during periods of storage, it should be possible to prolong their life span, further decreasing the cost of using them. In addition, recognizing the aberrations in their performance that warn of the exhaustion of the galvanic cells should permit timely recording and minimize downtime.\r"

  ".U": "90339078\r", 
  ".W": "Infrared analysis can determine exhaled concentrations of the three volatile anesthetics in common use because each absorbs infrared light. Many infrared analyzers use a single source of infrared light at a wavelength of 3.3 microns for measurements of all three agents but cannot identify which agent is in use. Organic gases such as ethanol also absorb infrared light. This study determined the effects on the accuracy of a single-wavelength infrared anesthetic monitor (Capnomac, Puritan-Bennett PB254) of (1) incorrect anesthetic agent setting, (2) mixtures of volatile anesthetics, and (3) ethanol vapor in the analyzed gas. Changing the agent setting on the monitor during steady-state delivery of an agent resulted in readings for the halothane setting five times higher than those for the enflurane setting, and six times higher than those for the isoflurane setting. These ratios reflect the monitor's fixed internal gain for each agent setting. Mixtures of anesthetics had a simple additive effect on the monitor's accuracy. With the monitor set for halothane, 0.2 vol% isoflurane mixed with halothane caused readings 1.2 vol% higher than the true halothane concentration. Conversely, with the monitor set for isoflurane, 1 vol% halothane mixed with isoflurane resulted in readings 0.2 vol% too high. In a model simulating alveolar gas, ethanol vapor corresponding to blood alcohol levels of 0.10, 0.30, and 0.50% had a slight but not clinically significant effect on readings for enflurane and isoflurane but increased readings with the halothane setting 3.5 times the corresponding level of blood alcohol. Clinicians can test for an interfering gas such as ethanol before induction by checking the reading in the halothane setting during preoxygenation.\r"

  ".W": "Anesthesia ventilators with bellows that rise on expiration (standing bellows) are favored over ventilators with bellows that descend during expiration (hanging bellows). Standing bellows will not rise if there is a disconnection, and thus they facilitate detection of disconnections. Yet, during a disconnection of ventilators with standing bellows, mechanical inspiration compresses the empty bellows beyond its resting position; with expiration the elastic bellows recoils and aspirates up to 140 ml, depending upon the fresh gas flow. Tidal volumes recorded after disconnection ranged from 50 to 140 ml (mean, 112.2 +/- 9.22 [SD]) at adult settings and from 55 to 90 ml (mean, 69.8 +/- 4.28 [SD]) at pediatric settings. Thus, spirometers that measure tidal volume (VT) in the expiratory limb of the breathing system may falsely indicate an expiratory VT after a disconnection of the breathing system at the Y-piece or the endotracheal tube. Existing low-pressure alarms and capnography alarms provide redundant warning of disconnection, however, should the ventilator continue to deliver small VTs after a disconnection.\r"

In vitro studies showed that the system is linear and the frequency response is flat (+/- 3 dB) up to 50 Hz. The technique permits gathering of high-quality pressure data and can be used in the area of neonatal clinical research for short-term monitoring.

Nineteen surgical patients were studied during closed-loop control of hypotension induced with sodium nitroprusside. This group of patients was compared with 10 similar patients in whom infusions of sodium nitroprusside were controlled manually by an anesthesiologist. Although the results of the two studies varied, no conclusion could be drawn regarding the superiority of either manual or closed-loop control. When manual versus automatic control of isoflurane-induced hypotension was assessed in a similar fashion, the two methods of induction were found to be comparable.\r"

The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly higher for patients with slowly proliferating tumors (3H-TdR-LI less than or equal to 2.8%) compared with rapidly proliferating tumors (RFS, 66% v 50%, P = .0007; OS, 85% v 73%, P = .0012). In the analysis of RFS, 3H-TdR-LI provided prognostic information independent of axillary node involvement, tumor size, and estrogen receptor (ER) status, with an estimated lower hazard ratio compared with the degree of nodal involvement, but equivalent to that of the other indicators. Conversely, nodal involvement was found to interact with 3H-TdR-LI and receptors on survival. Present findings confirm that tumor cell kinetics represents a prognostic indicator also in an adjuvant situation. 3H-TdR-LI can substantially contribute to a more precise definition of high-risk patients within subsets having the traditionally favorable prognostic characteristics.\r"

  ".U": "90339099\r", 
  ".W": "In earlier studies of the cytogenetic characteristics of leukemic lymphoblasts from children with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we concluded that certain chromosomal abnormalities explain, in part, the increased presence of high-risk features at diagnosis and the less favorable response to therapy among patients with this immunologic subclass of ALL. With extended follow-up and a larger patient population, we have further evaluated the biologic and clinical aspects of pre-B leukemia. Of 686 cases of ALL with adequate immunophenotyping, 150 were classified as pre-B cell. Seventy-seven (69%) of the 112 pre-B cases with fully banded karyotypes had a translocation. The t(1;19) accounted for 28 (25%) of these pre-B cases and 31 (6.5%) of all 480 consecutively banded ALL cases. Three (2.6%) of the pre-B cases had a novel dicentric (7;9)(p1?3;p11) translocation. A t(9;22)(q34;q11) and a t(4;11)(q21;q23) were observed in seven (6%) and three (2.6%) of the cases, respectively. Within the pre-B subgroup, comparison of t(1;19) cases (n = 28) with those having other translocations (n = 49) or no identifiable translocations (n = 35) indicated that higher leukocyte counts (P = .002), absence of DNA indexes greater than 1.16 (P = .02), higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels (P less than .0001), and a higher frequency of nonwhite race (P = .006) were significantly related to the t(1;19). Both the t(1;19) and other chromosomal translocations were associated with an adverse prognosis in the subset of patients treated from 1979 to 1984 (Total Therapy study X). In a more recent and more intensive chemotherapy program (Total Therapy study XI), neither the t(1;19) nor other chromosomal translocations has conferred an inferior outcome, suggesting that effective treatment can offset the negative impact of chromosomal rearrangements in cases of childhood pre-B ALL.\r"

Men were more likely to be current or previous smokers (94% v 84%; P less than .005), and in patients with a positive smoking history, cigarette consumption was greater in men (52.2 v 40.2 pack years; P = .0001). The proportion of adenocarcinomas compared with squamous cancers was high in women (45% v 23%), while these cell types were equally represented in men. The majority of patients in both sex groups had regionally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Survival was related to age, stage at presentation and cell type. In addition, sex was found to be an independent prognostic factor for survival. Women with tumors of all cell types lived longer than their male counterparts (P less than .0001), and survival by stage in patients with nonsmall-cell cancers was greater for women than it was for men. These data demonstrate that important sex-associated differences exist in presentation and survival from lung cancer. Such differences should be considered when planning and analyzing clinical trials.\r"

All patients received the following chemotherapy in 4-day courses: 50 mg/m2 of cisplatin intravenously (IV) and 40 mg/m2 of doxorubicin IV on day 1; 0.6 mg/m2 of vincristine IV on day 3; and 700 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide IV on day 4 (ADOC). The courses were repeated every 3 weeks, and toxic effects were tolerable. The radiologically defined overall clinical response rate (complete plus partial response) was 91% with 47% clinical complete remissions; median time to progression was 11 months (range, 0 to 96) and the median estimated (Kaplan-Meier) progression-free interval was 22 months. Five of the 15 clinical complete remissions were pathologically confirmed at thoracotomy. We believe the ADOC regimen qualifies for adjuvant and preoperative treatment of invasive thymoma due to the high complete response and overall response rates.\r"

Regardless of the level of fat (20 or 40 energy %) or the level of EFA (2 to 12 energy %), diets with TFA decreased the percentage of fat in mouse milk. When lactating females raised on the CFA diets were crossed to the TFA diets, TFA appeared in the milk at 12 h postcross, and within 4 d postcross the percent of milk fat was decreased to levels similar to that of nursing females raised continuously on the TFA diets. Conversely, lactating females crossed from TFA to CFA diets produced milk with percentage fat values and fatty acid compositions that approached those seen in nursing females fed the CFA diets continuously. The possible involvement of TFA in the classical milk fat depression phenomenon in ruminants and its potential relevance in human lactation are discussed.\r"

Because the eicosanoid cascade is regulated in part by the distribution of arachidonic acid [20:4(n-6)] among phospholipid subclasses, the effects of feeding blackcurrant seed oil [containing 18:3(n-6) and 18:3(n-3)] on the fatty acid composition of diacyl, alkylacyl and alkenylacyl subclasses of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were studied in mouse peritoneal macrophages. After 4 wk of dietary treatment, the relative distribution (mol %) of macrophage phospholipid classes and subclasses was not altered in animals fed blackcurrant seed oil relative to those fed corn oil [containing linoleic acid, 18:2(n-6)]. Macrophages from blackcurrant seed oil-fed animals had reduced levels of PC diacyl 18:3(n-6), 18:3(n-3), 20:3(n-6), 22:5(n-3), and alkylacyl 20:3(n-6), 22:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3). In general, dietary blackcurrant treatment produced fatty acid alterations in PE subclasses that were similar to those in PC. A major exception, however, was the reduction in 20:4(n-6) levels in all PE subclasses, whereas no effect in PC subclass 20:4(n-6) levels was noted. These findings indicate i) that pronounced differences in the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) compositions of macrophage PC and PE subclasses exist following dietary fat manipulation and ii) that 18:3(n-6) and 18:3(n-3) feeding can increase potential anti-flammatory precursor levels of 20:3(n-6) and (n-3) PUFA in the macrophage.\r"

Growing male rats were fed an experimental (riboflavin-deficient) or a control (riboflavin-supplemented) diet. Following 7 wk of feeding, RBC from riboflavin-deficient rats contained higher levels of peroxidation products, most likely due to decreased glutathione reductase activity. An elevation in glutathione peroxidase activity was also observed whereas the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was not affected. Membrane fluidity was studied by fluorescence polarization, using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5 hexatriene (DPH) as a probe. The fluidity of RBC membranes isolated from riboflavin-deficient rats was significantly lower than that of the controls. This decreased fluidity was accompanied by an increase in the activity of the membrane-bound enzyme acetylcholinesterase. This study demonstrated that a decrease in cells' ability to cope with peroxidative damage as a result of riboflavin deficiency may lead to changes in the fluidity and function of membranes.\r"

One group provided short-term data (n = 165), and the other, data spanning intervals of up to 20 y (n = 164). Although group average intakes changed little, there was a great deal of individual variation. Even at intervals as short as 6 m, current intake estimates accounted for only about 40% of the variance of intakes at an earlier time. Over longer intervals, the predictive value of one estimate in respect to a second deteriorated even further. Thus, across 5 y, less than 25% of the variance of all four nutrient intakes could be accounted for by current intake. The 95% confidence interval for an estimate of earlier intake based upon a later measurement was more than +/- 700 mg for calcium, the least consistent nutrient. The other three nutrients showed nearly identical interstudy consistency, with uncertainties relative to their respective means being about half as large as for calcium. These data show that accurate longitudinal estimates of intake require continuous, prospective monitoring and that current intake is not a good estimator of past intake for most nutrients, especially for calcium.\r"

It was of interest to determine if this differential in absorption would result in differences in bone development under chronic feeding conditions. The present study was designed to compare CCM with CaCO3 for effects on bone development in weanling female C/D rats fed either CCM or CaCO3 at 0.3 or 0.6% dietary Ca for 4 or 12 wk. There was a nonsignificant trend for rats fed CCM to weigh more and have larger bones than rats fed CaCO3. Histologic evaluation of cortical and trabecular bone revealed normal bone formation in all rats. Trabecular bone was significantly affected by calcium level and source. The 0.3% Ca diets (either source) resulted in reduced trabecular bone volumes in tibias. After 4 wk, rats fed CCM had 23-25% more trabecular bone than rats fed CaCO3. By 12 wk, the difference was even greater; rats fed CCM had 44-47% more trabecular bone than rats fed CaCO3. Dietary calcium source did not affect cortical bone. It is concluded that because of its positive effects on bone, CCM is a more bioavailable calcium source than CaCO3.\r"

  ".U": "90339168\r", 
  ".W": "The uptake of selenite by purified brush border membrane vesicles isolated from duodena of rachitic or vitamin D-treated chicks was studied by using radioactive selenite and a rapid filtration technique. Cholecalciferol treatment (500 IU at 72 h) significantly enhanced selenite uptake, a response that decreased when the vesicles were stored at room temperature for 2.5 h prior to the uptake measurement. Preincubation of the vesicles in 1.0 mmol/L H2O2 reduced [75Se]selenite uptake, indicating the involvement of oxidizable groups in the uptake reaction. Iodoacetic acid (IAA), a sulfhydryl-blocking reagent, at 1-2 mmol/L concentration eliminated the difference in selenite uptake due to cholecalciferol and had no effect on vesicles from rachitic animals. A higher concentration of IAA (10 mmol/L) enhanced selenite uptake manyfold and increased the absolute difference due to cholecalciferol treatment. Single intravenous doses of 100 IU cholecalciferol, 100 IU ergocalciferol, or 0.1 micrograms 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol also stimulated selenite uptake, suggesting a general response to vitamin D compounds. Normal animals given a single dose of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol 12 h prior to killing also responded. Treatments that enhanced the uptake of [75Se]selenite also increased the amount of membrane-bound sulfhydryl groups, suggesting the involvement of membrane-bound sulfhydryl groups in the vitamin D response. A significant increase in selenite uptake by intravenous 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol occurred within 10 min. This rapid effect provides a new tool to probe early biochemical effects of vitamin D on intestinal epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "Previous results indicated that beta-carotene, as present within the unicellular alga Dunaliella, accumulated in the liver of chicks to a much higher degree than did synthetic all-trans beta-carotene. Because the Dunaliella beta-carotene is composed of an approximately equal mixture of two stereoisomers, 9-cis and all-trans, we tested whether a similar mixture of purified beta-carotene isomers would yield comparable results. Indeed, analysis of liver following 2 wk of feeding show a 10-fold higher accumulation of beta-carotene in the chicks fed a mixture of purified 9-cis and all-trans beta-carotene as compared with those fed only all-trans beta-carotene. The ratio of 9-cis to all-trans beta-carotene in the liver was about three times higher than that present in the beta-carotene fed to the chicks. Retinol and retinyl esters accumulated to a similar degree in the livers of chicks given all treatments.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms involved in the recovery of body fat and liver metabolism after food restriction and refeeding are not understood. This study's aim was to determine the need for hepatic neural input for the compensatory changes in food intake, body composition and hepatic lipogenic enzymes seen upon realimentation after energy restriction. Rats underwent total surgical hepatic denervation or had sham operations. One group of sham-operated and denervated rats was fed a semipurified diet ad libitum; a second group was restricted to 40% ad libitum levels for 7 d, then given free access to food during a 2-d refeeding period. Body fat content and body fat recovery rate from below \"set point\" were not altered by hepatic denervation. These observations do not rule out liver involvement because blood-borne factors communicating energy status information to the central nervous system could be released from the liver. The activities of hepatic enzymes--glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and citrate cleavage enzyme--were stimulated at least twofold by restriction and refeeding when compared to ad libitum feeding. Hepatic denervation had no effect on basal enzyme levels in ad libitum-fed animals or on elevated enzyme activity induced by refeeding after food restriction. This study clearly demonstrates that hepatic innervation is not essential for energy balance and body composition regulation. The induction of lipogenic enzymes by food restriction and refeeding does not depend on central nervous system input to the liver.\r"

Animals were assigned to iron-deficient (ID) or control (CN) diets and to sedentary (SD) or treadmill-exercise (EX) groups for 6 or 12 wk. Iron-deficient animals (hemoglobin 7.2 +/- 0.2 g 100 mL-1) had a 17% higher RMR and had slower growth rates than CN animals. Exercise training affected growth but not RMR in iron deficiency. Oxygen consumption (Vo2) following pharmacologic injection of norepinephrine was similar in both iron-deficient and exercised groups despite a 35% lower maximal exercise Vo2 in trained iron-deficient rats. NE turnover was lower in heart (55%) and liver (80%) of iron-deficient animals relative to controls. Trained iron-deficient animals had lower NE turnover in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) than sedentary iron-deficient animals; however, training did not alter NE turnover in control animals. In vitro liver and IBAT T3 production was similar in all groups except for lower activities (40%) in 6-wk iron-deficient, exercised animals. The significant effect of exercise on the growth attenuation of iron-deficient, exercised animals is thus not explained by increased IBAT metabolic activity or a generalized sympathetic nervous system activation. Decreased T3 production during periods of rapid growth and lean body mass development, however, may be important in exercised, iron-deficient animals.\r"

The Centers for Disease Control is supporting four state health departments to test the feasibility of surveillance mechanisms for SPUN. These efforts will seek to develop workable case definitions, define prevalence estimates, identify high-risk populations and describe specific demographic, social and medical risk factors. Initial experience with SPUN surveillance indicates that a variety of approaches may prove feasible but that these require attention to issues such as measurement error, data collection burden, confidentiality and data management. SPUN surveillance may prove too costly to be practical for general application, but it can serve as a means to identify needy children and estimate the prevalence of undernutrition in specific high-risk populations.\r"

The surveys have ranged from a statewide health center-based investigation to a house-to-house survey in a public housing project. All included children between 1 and 6 years of age. Chronic undernutrition was defined as a height-for-age less than the 5th percentile of the National Center for Health Statistics growth charts, and acute undernutrition was defined as a weight-for-height less than the 5th percentile. The prevalence of chronic undernutrition was greater than expected in four surveys, whereas no acute undernutrition was observed. The prevalence of obesity, defined as a weight for height greater than the 95th percentile, was increased in four of the seven surveys. These data suggest that chronic undernutrition is increased among children at risk in Massachusetts.\r"

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the validity and reliability of the current literature, to draw conclusions, and to recommend future studies for unresolved issues. We reached the following conclusions: (1) Retrograde cystography should be the gold standard for diagnosing vesicoureteral reflux. When ultrasonography and cystography are performed together, all clinically important abnormalities in the urinary system are detected. Intravenous pyelography is needed only when either or both of these studies are abnormal. (2) Other than abolishing reflux, surgery offers no short-term advantages (in terms of preventing breakthrough urinary tract infections, improving renal function, or preventing the development of new scars, hypertension, or end-stage kidney disease) over medical management. (3) The short periods of follow-up and methodologic flaws encountered in the reviewed studies make determination of the incidence of hypertension in children with vesicoureteral reflux impossible. (4) Although indications for an association between vesicoureteral reflux and end-stage kidney disease exist, the strength of this association has not been determined.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a retrospective review of 55 near-drowning victims (mean age 4.75 years) admitted to the intensive care unit during a 5-year period, to determine the factors that may influence survival both before and after hospital admission. All patients who remained comatose after resuscitation received ventilation for an initial 24 hour period, after which an assessment of central nervous system injury was made. Intracranial pressure was not monitored, and barbiturate therapy was used only for seizure control. Thirty-seven children survived and 18 died; five survivors had profound neurologic damage resulting in a persistent vegetative state: the remaining 32 (58%) survived intact. The major factors that separated intact survivors from those who died and from survivors in a persistent vegetative state were the presence of a detectable heartbeat and hypothermia (less than 33 degrees C) on examination in the emergency department. Thirteen patients with absent vital signs and a temperature of greater than 33 degrees C either died or survived in a persistent vegetative state. Fourteen patients had a combination of absent vital signs and hypothermia and were resuscitated; eight died, two survived in a persistent vegetative state, and four survived intact. All intact survivors had been submerged in cold water for prolonged periods, and all underwent prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation. All patients with a detectable pulse, regardless of temperature, survived without neurologic sequelae. The 58% intact survival rate in this series compares favorably with the 50% we reported previously when high-dose barbiturate therapy and hypothermia were used to control intracranial pressure; at the same time, the number of survivors with a persistent vegetative state has been reduced by 50%. We conclude that prolonged in-hospital resuscitation and aggressive treatment of near-drowning victims who initially have absence of vital signs and are not hypothermic either results in eventual death or increases the number of survivors with a persistent vegetative state.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether head-elevated prone positioning is better than flat prone positioning for infants with gastroesophageal reflux, we studied 100 babies less than 6 months of age who were being examined for reflux with an intraluminal esophageal pH probe while the babies were in each of the two positions, with the use of a crossover design protocol. During both a 2-hour postprandial period and a fasting period, pH probe measurements in each position included (1) minutes with pH less than 4, (2) number of episodes with pH less than 4, (3) mean duration of such episodes, (4) number of such episodes longer than 5 minutes, and (5) the duration of the longest episode. Significant reductions with head elevation were found for only two of these 10 values: the frequency of reflux episodes postprandially (7.5 +/- 0.7 vs 5.9 +/- 0.5 episodes per 2 hours; p less than 0.05) and the frequency of episodes longer than 5 minutes postprandially (1.4 +/- 0.1 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1 episodes per 2 hours; p less than 0.005). There was no significant reduction in the total duration of postprandial reflux nor in any measure of reflux during the fasting period. The 90 infants in whom an abnormal degree of gastroesophageal reflux was documented had no significant differences between flat prone and head-elevated prone position for any of the 10 pH probe measurements. Head-elevated prone positioning is probably not worth the extra effort required to maintain it.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the possibility that infants with breath-holding spells have breathing disorders during sleep. Seventy-one breath holders with a median age of 14 weeks were selected from a well babies clinic because of their histories: 34 infants without loss of consciousness, and 37 with loss of consciousness (21 of the latter had had cyanotic spells, 14 pallid spells, and 2 combined cyanotic and pallid spells). For each breath holder, one control infant without a history of breath holding was chosen from the same clinic. All infants were healthy and had no known cause of disrupted breathing during sleep. Their histories indicated that the breath holders were covered with sweat during sleep (p = 0.005) or wakefulness (p = 0.006) significantly more often than were the control infants. The infants were studied during a one-night monitoring session, and the 142 sleep recordings were analyzed without knowledge of the history. The breath holders had significantly less nonrapid eye movement (stage III) sleep, more indeterminate sleep, more arousals, and more sleep-stage changes than the control infants had. Central apneas were evenly distributed in the two groups. Airway obstructions were found in 41 breath holders and six control infants; the obstruction lasted longer in the breath holders. The infants with airway obstruction during sleep snored more often (p = 0.023) and sweated more (p = 0.035) during sleep. The water evaporation rate, measured on the forehead with an evaporation meter, was significantly greater in the breath holders (p = 0.001). Ocular compression induced longer asystoles in the infants with pallid syncopes than in either those with cyanotic syncopes (p = 0.036) or those without loss of consciousness (p = 0.031). We conclude that the obstructed breathing during both wakefulness and sleep could be related to a common immature breathing control.\r"

Eighty exacerbations in 54 patients were studied. Exacerbations associated with influenza (n = 8) were compared with those associated with other nonbacterial infections (n = 15) and those in which no nonbacterial infection was detected (n = 57). Patients with influenza had lower Shwachman scores and were more likely to be seropositive for C-reactive protein than patients in the other two groups. Patients with influenza had a mean decrease in forced expiratory volume per second of 26%, compared with test results obtained before the exacerbation. In contrast, the mean decrease in forced expiratory volume per second was 6% for other nonbacterial infections and 12% for the group without nonbacterial infection (p less than 0.05 for both comparisons). The forced expiratory flow in first 25% of vital capacity decreased 44% in the influenza group compared with 13% and 17% in the other two groups, respectively (p less than 0.01 for both comparisons). The influenza group also had a higher proportion of patients with at least a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume per second and forced expiratory flow in first 25% of vital capacity than the other two groups had (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons). These data suggest that influenza is associated with severe exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis and support recommendations for efforts to prevent influenza in this population.\r"

The mean weight was 7.3 kg (range 5.2 to 13). Nine retransplantations were performed in five children because of primary nonfunction (three children), hepatic artery thrombosis (four), or rejection (two).

Baseline immunosuppression included cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine with OKT3 or anti-thymocyte globulin for steroid-resistant rejection episodes. Survivors were discharged after a mean hospital stay of 47 days (range 22 to 87), and nonsurvivors died within a mean of 40 days (range 0 to 120). The 1 year actuarial survival rate was 64.7%, in comparison with 75.8% in the whole series. One patient died perioperatively, two died from primary nonfunction, one from adenovirus infection, two from rejection, and one from bone marrow aplasia. Eighteen rejection episodes, of which 11 were steroid resistant, occurred in 11 patients. Our series shows that liver transplantation can be successful in this age group.\r"

Diagnosis was confirmed by serum thyroid hormone measurements by 4 weeks of age in 38 infants and between 40 and 80 days of age in the remainder. This group of infants was divided by radionuclide thyroid imaging into 34 infants with thyroid dysgenesis and nine with dyshormonogenesis. The group with thyroid dysgenesis was subdivided into 21 infants with athyreosis and 13 with residual thyroid tissue (11 ectopic and 2 hypoplastic glands). L-Thyroxine therapy, at an average dose of 10 to 14 micrograms/kg/day, was begun immediately after diagnosis, and serum concentration of total thyroxine, free thyroxine, triiodothyronine, reverse triiodothyronine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were determined serially. Serum concentration of total and of free thyroxine became normal within 1 week of the start of therapy in all groups. Despite a similarly mild degree of hypothyroidism at diagnosis observed in infants with dyshormonogenesis or with ectopia or hypoplasia, those with dyshormonogenesis had a more sensitive response to initial thyroid hormone replacement than did patients with thyroid dysgenesis, as judged by L-thyroxine does and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression. We conclude that the prompt restoration of clinical and biochemical euthyroidism during early infancy with doses of L-thyroxine between 10 and 14 micrograms/kg/day is a safe and effective method of therapy for children with congenital hypothyroidism.\r"

The facies were strikingly similar with small nose, anteverted nostrils, broad nasal bridge, and long thin upper lip with flat and long philtrum. Behavior, development, and intelligence were normal. Growth delay was noticed during infancy, and the two patients who completed normal puberty had marked short stature (140 and 150 cm), with relatively lean body habitus. The hands and feet were small, with short, plump tubular bones and broad proximal phalanges, associated with marked limitation in motion of fingers and wrists. The liver was enlarged after the age of 3 years. Two patients had mild mitral and tricuspid valve stenosis and one had severe aortic stenosis. The most severely affected child died at 3 1/2 years of age of airway obstruction as a result of progressive tracheal narrowing.

  ".W": "We reviewed the records of all patients with a diagnosis of ALL made at our center during a 13-year period to determine the relationship between bone pain and the hematologic findings at diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Of 296 eligible patients, 179 (60%) had no bone pain (group 1), 65 (22%) had some bone pain (group 2), and 52 (18%) had prominent bone pain that overshadowed other manifestations of the leukemia (group 3). Statistically significant differences were found between the groups for hemoglobin concentration (p less than 0.001), leukocyte count (p = 0.014), absolute neutrophil count (p = 0.002), percentage of circulating blast cells (p = 0.009), and platelet count (p less than 0.001). Children in group 3 had values closer to normal for all these values than those of patients in the other groups. Group 3 patients had symptoms an average of more than 2 weeks longer before diagnosis, and had significantly lower serum uric acid and higher calcium levels than patients in the other groups had. No differences were detected among the groups in age at diagnosis, gender, or survival rate. We conclude that children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have prominent bone pain preceding the diagnosis frequently have nearly normal hematologic values and that this feature may contribute to a delay in diagnosis.\r"

Fifty term infants who were enrolled into either a low serum bilirubin group (less than 8 mg/dl) or a moderate serum bilirubin group (10 to 20 mg/dl) were tested with the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale and a brain-stem auditory evoked response test. Partial correlation analysis controlling for phototherapy revealed that increased bilirubin concentration correlated negatively with the Brazelton orientation and with state range clusters and individual Brazelton test items that involve auditory processing. Increased bilirubin concentration correlated with an increased latency of brain-stem auditory evoked response wave 4, 5. An increased interpeak 1-5 (brain-stem conduction time) correlated with the decreased animate visual and auditory item. We conclude that moderate hyperbilirubinemia in term infants affects both infant behavior, as measured by specific components of the Brazelton test, and brain-stem conduction time, as measured by the brain-stem auditory evoked response test.\r"

All neonates were delivered by cesarean section and received ampicillin and gentamicin to suppress intestinal flora. The control group (n = 4) was treated with saline solution and ZnPP solvent; the erythrocyte-treated control group (n = 4) received erythrocytes and ZnPP solvent; and two experimental groups received erythrocytes and one dose of 10 (n = 3) or 40 (n = 4) mumol ZnPP/kg body weight, respectively. At 24 hours, administration of erythrocytes alone doubled the VeCO (p less than 0.05), carboxyhemoglobin level, (p less than 0.05), and plasma total bilirubin level (p less than 0.05). Treatment with ZnPP, 40 mumol/kg body weight, caused a significant decrease in VeCO (p less than 0.05), carboxyhemoglobin (p less than 0.05), bilirubin (p less than 0.05), and spleen heme oxygenase (p less than 0.05). Treatment of the erythrocyte-loaded animals with ZnPP, 10 mumol/kg body weight, also significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered VeCO and spleen heme oxygenase activity but did not cause a significant lowering of blood carboxyhemoglobin or plasma bilirubin concentration. We conclude that ZnPP is an effective, dose-dependent in vivo inhibitor of heme oxygenase in the newborn rhesus with latrogenic hemolysis, and that it suppresses both bilirubin production and subsequent accumulation.\r"

Five children received treatment via an endotracheal tube and four via an oxygen hood. Blood samples (3 to 17 per patient) and respiratory secretions (4 to 23 per patient) were assayed for ribavirin with reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Ribavirin triphosphate in erythrocytes was determined by ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean (+/- SD) peak ribavirin level after the first dose was 1725 +/- 2179 mumol/L in secretions and 3.8 +/- 2.6 mumol/L in plasma. Ribavirin in the secretions was rapidly cleared, with a mean (+/- SD), half-life of 1.9 +/- 0.8 hours. Plasma ribavirin increased with treatments to reach a steady state of 5 to 10 mumol/L. Mean peak ribavirin triphosphate levels were 15- to 300-fold higher than plasma ribavirin levels by the end of therapy. More than 98% reduction of viral load without the emergence of resistant virus was noted on day 3 of therapy. High-dose treatment was compatible with the aerosol equipment routinely used (small-particle aerosol generator, model 2-6000) for ribavirin administration and with ventilators. High-dose, short-duration ribavirin therapy was well tolerated by all patients, permitted easier accessibility for patient care, and may result in less environmental exposure of health care workers.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency of eye and auditory complications and their relationship to drug dosage and iron stores in patients receiving deferoxamine, we studied 52 regularly transfused patients who received deferoxamine by subcutaneous or intravenous infusion in doses from 26 to 136 mg/kg/day, and whose serum ferritin levels of 185 to 17,775 micrograms/L reflected a wide range of iron stores. Forty-nine patients (94%) had no evidence of drug-induced visual or auditory abnormalities. Symptomatic loss of vision and hearing developed in one patient; both problems improved when chelation therapy was stopped. Of the 51 symptom-free patients, one had a mild degree of macular stippling and one had a mild, bilateral, high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Eye and ear abnormalities in the symptom-free patients did not progress despite continuation or resumption of chelation therapy at the same dosage. Patients with ophthalmologic and audiologic abnormalities did not receive higher doses of deferoxamine and did not have lower serum ferritin levels than patients without such abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that eye and ear abnormalities during chelation therapy with deferoxamine may not occur uniformly at as high a frequency as previously reported, even in patients who receive large doses of the chelating agent or who have only modest amounts of excessive iron.\r"

The WIC participants are eligible pregnant, postpartum, and breast-feeding women, infants, and children up to their fifth birthday. The program currently serves 1.2 million infants each month. The U.S. Department of Agriculture National WIC Evaluation Study of Infants and Children is the most comprehensive assessment of WIC's impact on a national infant sample. Its findings indicate that WIC infants consumed more iron-fortified infant formula (the core of the WIC infant food package) than non-WIC infants and, as a result, had higher daily intakes of formula-related nutrients--namely, iron and vitamin C. Because of lower consumption of whole cow milk, WIC infants had lower daily intakes of milk-related nutrients--calcium, protein, magnesium, and vitamin B6. The research team concluded that increased dietary intake of specific nutrients occurs only during program participation and has no residual effect after participation ceases. Possible scientific and social science research that would be useful in federal policy decisions affecting infant participation in the WIC program is discussed.\r"

Gross energy intakes of 1-month-old, exclusively breast-fed infants are similar to recommended amounts of metabolizable energy; however, by 4 months of age, gross energy intakes of exclusively breast-fed infants are significantly less than current recommendations. Weight-for-age percentiles also fall during that period. Energy intakes (measured in kilocalories per kilogram) persist at less than recommended amounts, and weight-for-age percentiles continue to drop after solid foods are added to the diet. Energy intakes of formula-fed infants appear significantly higher than those of infants who are fed human milk. Growth rates, total daily energy expenditure, sleeping metabolic rates, minimal rates of energy expenditure, rectal temperature, and heart rates have been found to be lower in breast-fed infants. The maintenance of energy intakes and growth trajectories during the period of demand supplementation with solid foods suggests that intakes, growth rates, and rates of energy expenditure of human milk-fed infants are physiologic responses to an appropriate dietary intake.\r"
