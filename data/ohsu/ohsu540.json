The factors that initiate or underlie seizures are not well understood, but trauma, infectious disease and genetics have been implicated. An understanding of the molecular basis of seizures would shed light on the basic mechanisms of neuronal homeostasis and allow new therapeutic strategies to be explored. Here, we report the mapping of an epilepsy gene to a specific chromosomal region, on the basis of cosegregation of two closely-linked DNA markers with a form of epilepsy known as benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC2, 12120 in ref. 3). The linked markers confirm the genetic basis and autosomal dominant inheritance of this trait, and localize the gene causing BFNC in this family to the long arm of chromosome 20. This regional placement is the first step towards the isolation of a gene involved in neuronal activity in the human brain.\r"

In mutant cells that lack the Na+/H+ exchange activity, this alkalinization does not occur, and the cells do not proliferate without artificial elevation of pHi. It has therefore been widely suggested that an early pHi increase is a necessary signal for mitogenesis. In the presence of HCO3- however, growth factors fail to raise pHi in A431 cells, renal mesangial cells and 3T3 fibroblasts. In mesangial cells, arginine vasopressin (AVP) raises pHi in the absence of HCO3-, but lowers it when HCO3- is present; growth is stimulated under both conditions. We report here that, in the presence of HCO3-, AVP stimulates two potent HCO3- transporters, as well as the Na+/H+ exchanger. These are the Na+-dependent and Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchangers. Our results indicate that AVP causes acidification in the presence of HCO3- because, at the resting pHi, it stimulates Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange (which lowers pHi) more than it stimulates the sum of Na+/H+ exchange and Na+-dependent Cl-/HCO3- exchange (both of which raise pHi). The stimulation of three acid-base transporters by the growth factor AVP greatly enhances the ability of the cell to regulate pHi.\r"

  ".W": "When viewed through a small aperture, the perceived motion exhibited by a long moving line or grating is ambiguous. This situation prevails because even a perfect machine could only detect motion perpendicular to a moving contour, so motion parallel to a contour is undetectable. The human visual system views the world through an aperture array--the neural receptive fields. Therefore a moving object is viewed through many small apertures and the motion within many of those apertures is ambiguous. This ambiguity may be resolved by monitoring the motion of a distinctive feature, such as a line-end or corner, and attributing to the larger object the motion of the feature. Alternatively, Adelson and Movshon have suggested that moving images are processed in two stages, that is, they are first decomposed into one-dimensional components which are later recombined to generate perceived object motion. For a moving plaid, defined as the sum of two drifting gratings, these alternative models generate different predictions concerning the resolution of the plaid's motion ambiguity. A feature monitor would respond to the motion of the intersections between gratings, whereas the two-stage motion processor would first decompose the plaid into its constituent gratings and subsequently recombine them to generate the perception of a moving plaid. Using speed discrimination to distinguish between the two models, I find that discrimination thresholds reflect the speed of a plaid's component gratings, rather than the speed of the plaid itself. This result supports the two-stage model. Although speed discrimination is limited by component processing, observers cannot directly access component speed. The only perceptually accessible velocity signal is generated by the second-stage pattern processing.\r"

  ".W": "Alzheimer's disease is a central nervous system disorder characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques and dystrophic neurites in susceptible areas of the brain. Investigation of the mechanism and development of the disease has been hampered by the lack of an animal model and the inaccessibility of neural tissue during the illness. Deficits in odour detection and discrimination are among the signs of Alzheimer's and previous anatomical studies suggest that olfactory pathways may be involved early in the illness. Neurons in the olfactory epithelium, which are of central origin, are relatively accessible for biopsy and could be used as a source of living nerve cells for the study of Alzheimer's disease if they can be shown to have characteristics of this disease. As these neurons have the unusual property of arising from stem cells throughout the life of the organism, they are good candidates for the development of cell cultures or cell lines which may express the disorder from living patients. We report here that nasal epithelium tissue taken at autopsy shows unique pathological changes in morphology, distribution and immunoreactivity of neuronal structures in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium is transported across the surface membrane of both nerve and muscle by a Na+-dependent mechanism, usually termed the Na:Ca exchange. It is well established from experiments on rod outer segments that one net positive charge enters the cell for every Ca2+ ion extruded by the exchange, which is generally interpreted to imply an exchange stoichiometry of 3 Na+:1 Ca2+. We have measured the currents associated with the operation of the exchange in both forward and reversed modes in isolated rod outer segments and we find that the reversed mode, in which Ca2+ enters the cell in exchange for Na+, depends strongly on the presence of external K+. The ability of changes in external K+ concentration ([K+]o) to perturb the equilibrium level of [Ca2+]i indicates that K+ is co-transported with calcium. From an examination of the relative changes of [Ca2+]o, [Na+]o, [K+]o and membrane potential required to maintain the exchange at equilibrium, we conclude that the exchange stoichiometry is 4 Na+:1 Ca2+, 1 K+ and we propose that the exchange should be renamed the Na:Ca, K exchange. Harnessing the outward K+ gradient should allow the exchange to maintain a Ca2+ efflux down to levels of internal [Ca2+] that are considerably lower than would be possible with a 3 Na+:1 Ca2+ exchange.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of T lymphocytes requires the intracellular fragmentation of foreign antigens and their presentation by class I or class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins. The direct binding of peptides to class II molecules has been demonstrated using equilibrium dialysis, gel filtration and fluorescence energy transfer at planar membranes, and its specificity compared to that of T-cell activation. In contrast, direct binding of peptides to class I molecules has been difficult to detect; although peptide sensitization experiments and the crystallographic structure of HLA-A2 (ref. 9) persuasively argue for its occurrence and importance. Here we describe a gel filtration assay from which we derive direct evidence for selective binding of an influenza matrix peptide to HLA-A2 and for binding of an influenza nucleoprotein peptide to HLA-B37. These two peptides have previously been shown to act respectively as targets for certain HLA-A2 or HLA-B37 restricted influenza-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In addition we demonstrate binding to some, but not all, HLA allospecificities that cannot present these peptides to CTL. We estimate that less than 0.3% of the HLA molecules present in any given purified preparation were able to bind the added peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclic AMP regulates the expression of a number of genes through a conserved promoter element, the CRE1. Moreover, transcriptional induction by cAMP requires the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). We have previously characterized the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in PC12 cells and brain tissue as a nuclear factor, of relative molecular mass 43,000, whose transcriptional efficacy is regulated by protein kinase A phosphorylation. CREB stimulates transcription on binding to the CRE as a dimer. Experiments suggesting that the dimerization and transcriptional efficacy of CREB are each stimulated by phosphorylation at distinct sites prompted us to suggest that CREB is regulated by multiple kinases in vivo. We now report the isolation of a cDNA clone for rat CREB using amino-acid sequence information from purified CREB protein. Sequence analysis of this CREB cDNA predicts a cluster of protein kinase A, protein kinase C and casein kinase II consensus recognition sites near the N terminus of the protein. The proximity of these potential phosphorylation sites to one another indicates that they may interact either positively or negatively to regulate CREB bioactivity.\r"

This idea is supported by examples of apparent exon duplication and by shared domains among both alternatively spliced and completely separate genes. During this process it is probable that some combinations of exons would not prove advantageous and would therefore be lost. Here we report that within the active single-copy human gene for alpha A-crystallin there is a 'pseudo-exon' in the early stages of being extinguished, perhaps the result of a failed experiment in the evolution of this specialized, lens-specific protein.\r"

  ".W": "Structural fluctuations in proteins on the picosecond timescale have been studied in considerable detail by theoretical methods such as molecular dynamics simulation, but there exist very few experimental data with which to test the conclusions. We have used the technique of inelastic neutron scattering to investigate atomic motion in hydrated myoglobin over the temperature range 4-350 K and on the molecular dynamics timescale 0.1-100 ps. At temperatures below 180 K myoglobin behaves as a harmonic solid, with essentially only vibrational motion. Above 180 K there is a striking dynamic transition arising from the excitation of nonvibrational motion, which we interpret as corresponding to torsional jumps between states of different energy, with a mean energy asymmetry of 12 kJ mol-1. This extra mobility is reflected in a strong temperature dependence of the mean-square atomic displacements, a phenomenon previously observed specifically for the heme iron by Mossbauer spectroscopy, but on a much slower timescale (10(-7) s). It also correlates with a glass-like transition in the hydration shell of myoglobin and with the temperature-dependence of ligand-binding rates at the heme iron, as monitored by flash photolysis. In contrast, the crystal structure of myoglobin determined down to 80 K shows no significant structural transition. The dynamical behaviour we find for myoglobin (and other globular proteins) suggests a coupling of fast local motions to slower collective motions, which is a characteristic feature of other dense glass-forming systems.\r"

This process of degeneration is complete by one year, with preservation of all other retinal cells. The biochemical defect that leads to the mutant phenotype is not known. Our strategy for cloning the rds gene was based upon three previously reported observations. First, the rds locus maps to chromosome 17. Second, experimental rds/rds----+/+ and rds/+----+/+ tetra-parental mice manifest patchy photoreceptor changes in the retina, suggesting that the wild-type rds locus is expressed within cells of the photoreceptor lineage. Finally, the process of degeneration is specific to photoreceptors. On the basis of these observations, we predicted that the rds mRNA is encoded by a gene on chromosome 17 and is normally expressed exclusively within photoreceptors in the retina. We here present evidence that this is the case.\r"

On the basis of structural similarities to the Drosophila genes and of their spatially and temporally restricted expression patterns during mouse embryogenesis, it has been proposed that these mammalian genes also are involved in the control of development. To elucidate the function of homoeobox genes by genetic means, mouse mutants must be generated. We have developed a technique for mutagenesis in vivo and have used it to mutate the homoeobox Hox 1.1 gene. In vivo mutagenesis was achieved through homologous recombination between an endogenous Hox 1.1 allele and a microinjected mutated gene in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. Mutant cells were identified by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and mutant clones were used to generate chimaeric mice. Because the homologous recombination event is formally a gene conversion event and no selection is required to screen for cells carrying the mutated allele, in vivo mutagenesis allows specific alterations in the target sequence to be made without the introduction of any other sequences.\r"

Our hybridization analysis in situ has revealed that expression of En-2 is restricted to a specific domain of the developing central nervous system from 8 days of development on, indicating a role for the gene in establishing spatial domains in the brain. Unfortunately no En-2 mutations are available to elucidate further its function in development. To this end, we report here the isolation of three pluripotent embryonic stem cell lines in which one copy of the homoeobox-containing gene, En-2, has been altered by homologous recombination.\r"

In cases where the tumour is familial and susceptibility is inherited, a mutation in one of the alleles is carried in the germline. We have recently shown that cytogenetically visible germline mutations are usually in the paternally derived gene. Such a bias would not be expected for sporadic (non-familial) tumours, where both mutations occur in somatic tissue, but there has been some indication of a bias towards initial somatic mutation in the paternally derived gene on chromosome 11 in sporadic Wilms tumour. We have now examined 13 sporadic osteosarcomas and find evidence which indicates that in 12 cases the initial mutation was in the paternal gene, suggesting the involvement of germinal imprinting in producing the differential susceptibility of the two genes to mutation.\r"

The isolated calcium channel has been identified morphologically with the 'foot' structures which are associated with the junctional face membrane of the terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum. In situ, the foot structure extends across the gap of the triad junction from the terminal cisternae of the reticulum to the transverse tubule. We describe here the three-dimensional architecture (3.7 nm resolution) of the calcium channel/foot structure from fast-twitch rabbit skeletal muscle, which we determined from electron micrographs of isolated, non-crystalline structures that had been tilted in the electron microscope. The reconstruction reveals two different faces and an internal structure in which stain accumulates at several interconnected locations, which could empty into the junctional gap of the triad junction. The detailed architecture of the channel complex is relevant to understanding both the physical path followed by calcium ions during excitation-contraction coupling and the association of the terminal cisternae and the transverse tubules in the triad junction.\r"

While addressing the conservation of specific protein interactions during the evolution of these enzymes, we were able to switch one of their amino-acid-specific equatorial domains to produce a viable chimaeric enzyme. This was achieved by the in vitro fusion of DNA encoding the polar domain of OTCase to DNA encoding the equatorial domain of ATCase. The resulting gene fusion successfully transformed an argI-pyrB deletion strain of E. coli to pyrimidine prototrophy, giving rise to Pyr+ transformants that expressed ATCase but not OTCase activity. The formation of this active chimaeric enzyme shows that by exchanging protein domains between two functionally divergent enzymes we have achieved a switching in substrate specificity.\r"

Forty cynomolgus monkeys were divided by restricted randomization into 2 treatment groups of 20. Five animals from each treatment group were randomized into subgroups 1 and 2. The animals of subgroup 1 were studied pathologically. Brain biopsies of the animals in subgroup 2 were performed and studied with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The remaining 20 animals supplemented the number studied angiographically. Significant VSP (P less than 0.05) was detected in the majority of vessels from the clot site (right) of both treatment groups. Electron microscopy results showed positive correlation with the angiographic data. When comparing the effects of U74006F to those of the placebo at day 7, there was a significant difference (P less than 0.05) in the degree of VSP in the right extradural internal carotid and right middle cerebral arteries. This resulted from a greater degree of VSP in placebo animals. Two animals developed delayed ischemic deficits, one from each group. The infarct of the U74006F animal was smaller than the infarct in the placebo animal. Although overall changes in phosphagen levels did not reach statistical significance, HPLC analysis of the cortical biopsies did show a decrease in the ATP/ADP +/- AMP ratio of 54% in placebo animals and only 7% in animals receiving U74006F. The middle cerebral arteries of 2 animals were also studied with HPLC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifteen rabbits were divided into three groups: 1) an acutely hydrocephalic group in which 3 cisternal injections of blood were followed by a study of CSF pressure, ventricular size, and CSF outflow pathways 1 week after the last injection; 2) a control group treated according to the same protocol, except that sterile saline was injected instead of blood; and 3) a chronic group also treated according to the same protocol but in which the animals were maintained an average of 4 weeks after the last blood injection. Ventricular size was measured by computed digitation and expressed as an area ratio of ventricle to brain (VBR). In control animals, 11.8% of the injected colloid dosage was found in cranial perineural lymphatic channels, and 4.8% appeared in the spinal cord. The mean CSF pressure was 149 +/- 20.2 mm H20 (mean +/- SE) and the mean VBR was 0.040 +/- 0.003. In animals evaluated 1 week after subarachnoid injection, accessory cranial perineural lymphatic outflow decreased significantly to 3.4%, and spinal cord activity increased to 9.8% (P less than 0.05, two-tailed t-test).

In addition, the predictive value of different clinical grading systems as applied to this series was compared. All patients had a computed tomographic scan and a positive angiogram before surgery. Complete resection was proven angiographically. The univariate Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test, the Fisher exact test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis, and multivariate logistic regression were used as statistical methods. Duration of surgery, the development, of either new deficits or an increase in the preoperative neurological signs immediately after surgery, and rehabilitation (as measured by the Karnofsky index) were taken as target variables for the difficulty of operation and for postoperative morbidity, respectively. The largest diameter of the nidus of the arteriovenous malformation, eloquence of the adjacent brain, and deep venous drainage showed the most consistent correlation with these target variables. Intracerebral hematoma and other single factors, such as the age of the patient or localization of the arteriovenous malformation did not affect the outcome. The clinical grading scale of Spetzler and Martin provided better prediction of surgical risks than other proposed systems.\r"

The compressive agents included 34 tumors, 4 osteophytes, 5 fibrous bands, 4 traumatic lesions, 2 neural elements, and 2 infectious processes. The main site was the second portion of the VA (C2-C6) (30 of 51 patients). Compression always induced at least significant stenosis, and in 8 patients caused complete occlusion. The compression was either permanent (44 patients) or intermittent (7 patients). Symptoms were observed in 11 patients, including 2 with permanent deficits. Surgical release of compression was performed each time symptoms could be explained by a reduction in VA flow and also when the compressing agent needed to be removed, as in the cases involving tumors. VA decompression was achieved by direct approach in 37 patients, by reduction and fixation of a traumatic dislocation in 2 patients, and by distal revascularization in 4 patients. Medical treatment or roentgenotherapy was used in the other patients. Results were excellent in all but 2 patients, who died from traumatic and ischemic lesions, respectively. Therefore, it seems important to identify external causes of compression of the VA for two reasons: 1) to suppress symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency when their relation to VA compression is clearly established, and 2) to remove compressive agents like tumors safely while preserving the VA.\r"

Laminectomy is recognized, however, as the occasional cause of problems after surgery, such as spinal instability or deformity, acceleration of spondylotic change, constriction of the dura mater caused by extradural scar formation, and lack of posterior bony protection for the spinal cord. In an effort to eliminate these negative aspects of conventional laminectomy, a surgical technique called suspension laminotomy has been used. Fifty-five patients treated with conventional extensive laminectomy and 55 others treated with suspension laminotomy were followed up clinically and compared. Flexibility and alignment of the cervical spine were assessed by plane radiographs, and dural configuration by computed tomographic scans. Neurologic improvement was also evaluated. Decrease of spinal movement after laminectomy was observed, notably during extension, probably as a result of functional insufficiency of paraspinal muscles. The incidence of postoperative spinal deformity was lower and the relief of dural constriction better in the patients treated with suspension laminotomy than in those treated with conventional laminectomy. Neurological recovery was significantly better in fully decompressed cases than in insufficiently decompressed cases.\r"

To study the effects of graded hypotension upon spinal and cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SMEPs), and spinal motor evoked potentials (SMEPs), 12 anesthetized cats were subjected to graded hypotension ranging from a mean arterial blood pressure of 100 mmHg to 30 mmHg or less. Hypotension causes a progressive increase in onset latency and a decrease in amplitude and conduction velocity of SEPs and SMEPs. Cortical SEPs and SMEPs were sensitive to profound hypotension (MAP less than 30 mmHg). Spinal SEPs showed more resistance and disappeared at lower levels of hypotension. Immediate blood transfusion caused resumption of cortical SEPs and SMEPs within 30 minutes after infusion; however, the latency and amplitude of responses did not reach the baseline values within 1 hour after transfusion. The sequential recovery of evoked responses was dependent upon the length of hypotension. When 15 minutes elapsed between loss of responses and transfusion, cortical SEPs and SMEPs did not resume within 1 hour after infusion. No return of signals occurred if 30 minutes elapsed between the loss of evoked responses and blood reperfusion. These findings suggest that ischemia associated with profound systemic hypotension can alter or obliterate evoked responses.\r"

MEP were recorded from the contralateral thenar and anterior tibial muscles in response to single transcranial electrical stimuli on the motor cortex. Intraoperatively, during neuroleptic anesthesia we found the amplitudes to be reduced to an average of 11% of the preoperative baselines for the thenar potentials, and to 7% of the preoperative baselines for the anterior tibial muscle potentials, despite a maximum stimulus strength of 750 V. A similar reduction of MEP amplitudes was observed in 6 volunteers during breathing of an oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture (34%/66%), whereas fentanyl, flunitrazepam, and thiopental had only a minor effect on MEP. We conclude that with respect to anesthesia-related suppression of amplitudes, an average of 5 to 15 electromyographic responses should be evaluated for intraoperative monitoring of MEP using the technique described here.\r"

Seven patients were operated upon twice on the same side and 4 were operated upon on both sides at different times. In each case, the brainstem auditory evoked potentials were monitored intraoperatively by the same neurophysiologist. In 75 of these operations, compound action potentials were also recorded from the exposed 8th nerve. Comparison of speech discrimination scores before the operation and at the time of discharge showed that at discharge, discrimination had decreased in 7 patients by 15% or more and increased in 4 patients by 15% or more, in 2 patients by as much as 52%. Essentially similar results were obtained when preoperative speech discrimination scores were compared with results obtained from the 87 patients who returned for a follow-up visit between 3 and 6 months after discharge. Only one patient lost hearing (during a second operation to relieve hemifacial spasm). Another patient (also operated upon to relieve hemifacial spasm) suffered noticeable hearing loss postoperatively, but had recovered nearly normal hearing by 4 months after the operation. Nine patients had an average elevation of the hearing threshold for pure tones in the speech frequency range (500 to 2000 Hz) of 11 dB or more at 4 to 5 days after the operation; 8 of these had fluid in their middle ears that most likely contributed to the hearing loss. Threshold elevations occurred at 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz in 19 and 29 ears, respectively.\r"

Using our procedure, two types of cells were identified on intraocular lenses removed from monkey eyes 7 days after implantation. These cells had the typical structural features of multinucleated giant cells and of macrophages. It thus appears that this procedure will permit study of the cytology of intraocular lens surfaces.\r"

Thirty randomly chosen eyes from 30 subjects without ocular disease were examined: the mean disc area (2.20 +/- SD 0.58 mm2), the mean cup area (0.36 +/- 0.29 mm2) and the mean rim area (1.83 +/- 0.37 mm2) were evaluated. All the measurements were performed by two independent observers and were corrected to the actual size by measuring refraction and axial length of each eye. A linear correlation among disc areas (r = 0.71), cup areas (r = 0.93) and rim areas (r = 0.74) between the two observers was found. Furthermore, a highly significant correlation between disc area and rim area was observed (r = 0.90) together with a correlation between the disc and cup area (r = 0.82). A correlation between disc area and axial length was finally found (r = 0.59). The neuroretinal rim area has been expressed as a percentage of the total disc area. Percent values (+/- SD) were clustered around a mean of 84.83 +/- 8.8%. Despite their high degree of repeatability, our data are slightly different from those previously reported by other authors.\r"

Saccades were initially performed for 30 s with visual fixation targets. The targets were then switched off. The subjects continued saccades in the dark with the given amplitude. Most memory-guided saccades overshot the target. Saccades with an amplitude error of 12.7 +/- 7.3 degrees (mean +/- SD) were followed by corrective saccades, while no corrective saccades occurred following saccades with an error of 4.3 +/- 4.0 degrees. The accuracy of initial memory-guided saccades decreased with time. However, the amplitude of the memory-guided saccades was corrected when the error was beyond about 5 degrees. These results suggest that memory-guided saccades are not repetitions of visually guided saccades, but nonvisual error signals relate to the control of eye movements in the dark.\r"

Words that were filtered using an image enhancement function based on an observer's losses in visual function relative to a normal observer (1) reduced the magnification (30-70% less magnification was needed) and (2) increased the reading rate (2-3 times), measured in words per minute. The greater the loss in central visual function, the more individualized compensation filters reduced the magnification needed for word recognition. Individualized compensation filters improved the clarity and visibility of words for low vision observers. This study also found that the shape of the enhancement function was important to determine the optimum compensation filter for improving reading performance. In addition, the individualized compensation filters can be implemented by inexpensive hardware, for example in a closed circuit television (CCTV), to provide a significantly more effective low vision aid for observers with losses in central vision to read text, than is provided using only magnification.\r"

The use of the three-step test in these clinical situations may lead to incorrect diagnosis and treatment. These clinical conditions include contracture of the vertical recti, paresis of more than one vertical muscle, dissociated vertical divergence, previous vertical muscle surgery, skew deviation, myasthenia gravis, and small nonparalytic vertical deviations associated with horizontal strabismus. Several diagnostic steps in addition to the three-step test are necessary to tell if one is in fact dealing with a palsy of a single cyclovertical muscle.\r"

The average area of bared choroid and sclera was greater in normal-tension glaucoma (5.8 arbitrary units of area) than in ocular hypertension (1.4 units). Myopic eyes were prevalent among the normal-tension glaucoma group. When eyes with more than 4 diopters (D) of myopia were excluded from the analysis, the difference in prevalence and size of chorioscleral crescents and halos remained. Thus, the presence of a crescent correlates with disc damage, but further work is needed to determine if the correlation represents peripapillary atrophy that accompanies glaucomatous nerve atrophy or represents a greater susceptibility of discs with preexisting peripapillary abnormality.\r"

In order to test the validity of conventional assumptions about the anatomic basis for each type of crescent, the authors compared histologic sections to previously obtained clinical photographs and fluorescein angiograms of 21 eyes enucleated for choroidal melanomas. The authors' results define several configurations of peripapillary tissue, but also show that there can be more than one anatomic basis for some appearances. A scleral lip, which consists of an anterior extension of sclera to separate the choroid from the optic nerve head, is nearly always present, and ophthalmoscopically appears as a white rim that marks the disc margin and accumulates fluorescein after the vascular transit in an angiogram. A chorioscleral crescent occurs when the RPE is retracted from the disc margin, most prominent when associated with a tilted exit canal for the axon bundles through the sclera. In such a crescent, the choroid may be thinned or absent next to the disc, exposing to view some of the underlying sclera. Malposition of the embryonic fold occurs when the boundary between the neural retina and the RPE does not coincide with the embryologically formed fold in the neuroectoderm that occurs at the disc. When this occurs, there is either a double layer RPE (forming a very dark pigment crescent) or a double layer of incompletely formed neural retina adjacent to the disc.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No significant decline in fiber number or neural area with increasing age was found. The authors found a large variability of axonal number among their patients. This variability would have obscured any small effect of aging. Linear regression analysis of the effect of age on mean axonal diameter yielded a slight negative slope (P less than 0.01), suggesting a redistribution of fiber diameter. This could occur from axonal shrinkage, from preferential large fiber loss, or from the technical features of tissue acquisition and analysis. The authors suspect that the explanation is a selective loss of large nerve fibers.\r"

Three hundred eighty-eight consecutive patients who presented to the University of Iowa between 1959 and 1984 were followed for a mean of 7.9 +/- 5.8 years after the detachment in the first eye. Fellow eyes which received no prophylactic treatment had a 2.5 times greater risk of a new break or RD over 7 years than eyes receiving full prophylactic treatment (19.4 versus 7.5%; P = 0.0002). Fellow eyes receiving no treatment also had a greater risk of a new RD over 7 years than eyes receiving full treatment (5.1 versus 1.8%; P = 0.0125). These results do not allow us to make recommendations concerning which fellow eyes, if any, should be prophylactically treated. On the one hand, prophylactic treatment did significantly reduce the risk of new breaks and detachments. On the other hand, however, prophylactic treatment reduced the risk of new RD alone in the fellow eye only from 5.1 to 1.8% over 7 years. In addition, prophylactic treatment did not reduce the risk of detachment in the higher risk eyes with high myopia or extensive lattice.\r"

The stored image was then processed by several operators, to reduce shade variations in the image background and enhance the contrast between this background and the exudates. Exudates were separated from the background on the basis of their brightness or \"gray level\" and were then copied in to a binary image. For comparative purposes, the binary image was superimposed on the original unprocessed image. Exudate areas were measured using the binary image, which was also transferred to a printer to provide a permanent record or \"exudate map.\" The system was able to discriminate between standard photographs used to grade hard exudates in the Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). It was also used to monitor the response of a subject to laser treatment.\r"

In diseases that produce neovascularization of the iris (NVI), such as diabetes mellitus and central retinal vein obstruction, a judiciously timed PRP can reduce the incidence of neovascular glaucoma. Neovascularization of the iris can occur after central retinal artery obstruction (CRAO) as well. In this article, the authors report the outcome of 17 patients who received PRP to treat rubeosis iridis secondary to CRAO. Eleven of the 17 patients (65%) showed regression of NVI after PRP. Although the uncontrolled and retrospective nature of this study precludes drawing definitive conclusions from these data, PRP appears to be effective in reducing the incidence of neovascular glaucoma, if it is delivered before the development of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Once neovascular glaucoma occurs, additional modalities appear to be necessary in order to adequately control the elevated IOP.\r"

Thirty patients who underwent mandibular advancement and 15 patients who underwent mandibular setback were included in this study. Preoperatively, a lateral cephalogram in centric relation and a second cephalogram with the mandible at maximum voluntary gape were obtained. Immediately following surgery, another centric relation cephalogram was obtained. A composite tracing of the two preoperative tracings was made to show how the mandible changed in position from the closed-mouth to the open-mouth radiographs. The proximal segment (ramus) of the postoperative cephalogram was then superimposed on the open-mouth mandibular ramus, and the distal segment of the postoperative mandible was drawn. This composite produced a tracing of what the postoperative maximal gape cephalogram would be if the same amount of condylar rotation and translation as in the preoperative tracing had occurred. The preoperative interincisal dimension was recorded on the composite tracings (factoring in any overbite or openbite) as was the would-be postoperative interincisal dimension. These measures were compared using the paired t test and Pearson's correlations to determine if there were any significant differences between them. The results showed that the interincisal dimension is a fairly reliable measure of mandibular mobility even when the length of the mandible is altered with surgery.\r"

The purpose of this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was to evaluate the effect of chlorhexidine 0.1% mouthrinses on oral flora and irradiation mucositis. This study included 30 patients with head and neck cancer who had comparable irradiation portals. One group (N = 15) rinsed four times daily with chlorhexidine 0.1%, the other group (N = 15) with a placebo. The oral flora was cultured (oral washing technique) twice before and three times per week during the period of radiotherapy. On the same days, the severity of mucositis was determined. The colonization index of viridans streptococci was significantly reduced only after 5 weeks of chlorhexidine 0.1% treatment. The colonization patterns of Candida species, Streptococcus faecalis, staphylococci, and Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Acinetobacter species were not influenced by 5 weeks of use of chlorhexidine rinses when compared with the placebo. No differences were seen between the two study groups in the development and severity of mucositis. In conclusion, suppression of oral flora and a lowering of the severity of mucositis by means of disinfecting mouthrinses were not successful.\r"

An increased exposure time, and consequent greater tube loading, was necessary to maintain film density. Extended gray-scales (i.e., reduced radiographic contrast) occurred at both energy levels tested with the use of Al-Y filtration. Subjective evaluation of image quality in terms of clarity, resolution, and contrast was carried out independently by nine periodontologists.

  ".W": "Three hundred and four consecutive cementless Ortholoc I TKAs were followed for 2 to 5 years. One patient had femoral and tibial component loosening. There were no cases of patellar component loosening, but six knees had failure of the patellar polyethylene surface due to wear. A major design change of the metal-polyethylene locking mechanism was effected to address this problem. The patellar component is now countersunk and the central post has been reduced in size. 79.1 per cent of the knees were graded excellent, 13.4 per cent good, 5.8 per cent fair, and 1.7 per cent poor. The Ortholoc I group was compared to a similar group of 424 Ortholoc II knees at 1 year postoperatively for pain relief. The Ortholoc II knee differs from the Ortholoc I primarily in tibial component fixation, using four peripheral 6.5-mm screws. The Ortholoc II group had significantly fewer painful knees, which suggests that the screws in the tibial component were effective in improving fixation and controlling load distribution. Survival analysis showed no tendency for the results to deteriorate over the time span studied. Cementless fixation of all components, including the tibia and patella, was highly successful and can be achieved without stress relief of the distal femur.\r"

  ".W": "Historical review up to 1969 showed the emergence of conservative hemiarthroplasty resurfacings and rigid all-metal hinges. The first cemented metal-on-plastic design, introduced in 1969, began a decade in which a large number of different condylar designs were introduced. Variations of these condylar replacements in terms of femoral-tibial surface conformity, the fixation elements, and the provision for the patellofemoral joint produced wide variations of clinical results. In parallel with these condylar replacement designs, unicompartmental and both lax and fixed hinges were still used for particular indications. A review of all of the different design types showed that the most successful results were obtained with partially conforming condylar replacements with provision for the patellofemoral joint. Although cemented condylar replacement components composed the majority of the clinical reports, press-fit uncemented designs also had significant promise. The results of unicompartmental designs depended dramatically upon the indications. Present hinged replacements, whether lax or fixed-axis, produced problems that were sufficiently serious to restrict their use to cases in which condylar replacements were distinctly inadequate. Despite the success of condylar replacements at up to 10 years follow-up, a number of problems remain. These include optimizing the femoral-tibial geometry for maximum range of motion, minimum loosening, and minimum wear. Longer-term problems include improved design for long-term fixation and reduction of wear of polyethylene by optimum surface geometry, by better material quality control, or by improved materials. Whichever instrumentation system was used, surgical parameters such as component placement and sizing were shown to affect the potential range of motion. Considerations of design were given for revision cases in which condylar replacements were inadequate. Certain design suggestions were made for minimizing the serious problems used with lax or fixed-axis hinged replacements.\r"

With this type of knee arthroplasty, the posterior cruciate ligament is routinely sacrificed. Survivorship results revealed that 98.9 per cent of the knees had good outcome at 9 years of follow-up, using revision surgery for aseptic and septic loosening and radiographic evidence of global radiolucency or shift of the component as endpoint. Radiographic survivorship analysis showed well-fixed components in 87 per cent of implants, using endpoint criteria of appearance and progression of radiolucency under tibial component. Sacrificing the posterior cruciate ligament does not adversely affect durability of fixation of the total-condylar knee arthroplasty. Bone cement provides an excellent fixation of total knee implant.\r"

Female BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with naltrexone (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) or saline alone and tested for analgesia using the formalin test. Naltrexone produced a statistically significant dose-dependent analgesia, with an ED50 of 0.05 mg/kg and almost total analgesia at doses of 0.1 mg/kg or greater. To determine the relationship between naloxone analgesia and better documented forms of opioid analgesia, BALB/c mice were injected with naloxone or saline following the administration of a pre-determined ED50 for morphine and tested for analgesia using the tail-flick and formalin tests. Naloxone antagonized morphine analgesia in the tail-flick test at both doses used (0.3 and 10 mg/kg). In the formalin test, however, naloxone attenuated morphine analgesia at the lower doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and potentiated morphine analgesia at the highest dose (10 mg/kg). The implications of this finding are discussed.\r"

To ensure the pain specificity of the results the subliminal modality, i.e., thermal sensitivity thresholds to warm and cold stimuli, was investigated in addition to the threshold for perception of heat pain. Assessments were made on the right hand and foot, the stimuli being presented with a thermoelectric contact-thermode. Despite the influence of variables other than time of day (45-56% of the total variance), diurnal variations were found for some subjects on the pain threshold measure (significant correlation between days and relatively high frequency of 24 h component in Fourier analysis spectra). However, they could not be demonstrated for the thermal sensitivity measures. The diurnal variations in pain perception thresholds did not have a consistent pattern over all subjects (Friedman test). The small diurnal variations with interindividual differences in the pattern are therefore not sufficient to explain the variations seen in clinical pain, but they may be useful in detecting pain modulators by investigating correlations.\r"

  ".W": "The intention of the present study was to characterize patients with central post-stroke pain (CPSP) with regard to type and location of the cerebrovascular lesion (CVL), the characteristics of the pain and the neurological symptoms and signs in addition to the pain. Twenty men and 7 women with a mean age of 67 years and a mean pain duration of 44 months were examined 9-188 (mean 53) months after their stroke. The clinical symptoms and signs and the CT scans indicated that the CVL were located in the lower brain-stem in 8 patients, involved the thalamus in 9 patients and were located lateral and superior to the thalamus in 6 patients. In the remaining 4 patients the location of the CVL could not be determined with certainty. The 3 identified hematomata were all located in the thalamus. The onset of the pain was immediate in 4 patients, within the first post-stroke months in 10 patients and delayed by 1-34 months in the rest. The pain was on the left side in 18 patients. Twenty patients had hemipain. Most patients experienced more than one type of pain. The most common qualities were burning, aching, pricking and lacerating, with some differences in the frequencies according to the location of the CVL. Burning pain was most common, except among the patients with thalamic CVL, in whom lacerating pain was more common. Aching and pricking pain were also frequent. All patients considered the pain to be a great burden and most rated the pain intensity as high on a visual analogue scale. The intensity was increased by external stimuli, the most common being joint movements, cold and light touch. Five patients reported aggravation by emotional stimuli. Besides pain, the only neurological symptom common to all patients was decreased temperature sensibility, as shown by quantitative methods. It is possible that pain sensibility was also abnormal in all. Hypersensitivities to cutaneous stimuli, including evoked dysesthesias were found in 88% of the patients, while the detection thresholds for touch and vibration were abnormal in only 52% and 41%, respectively. Similarly, low figures were found for paresis and ataxia, which were present in 48% and 62%, respectively. It is concluded that only a minority of patients with central pain after stroke have thalamic lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Treatment was given, in randomized order, for periods of 4 weeks, separated by 1 week wash-out. The final doses were 75 and 800 mg/day, respectively, for amitriptyline and carbamazepine. The treatment effects were assessed by daily ratings of pain intensity on a 10-step verbal scale and at the end of each treatment period by a global rating of the analgesic effect on a 5-step verbal scale. For the assessment of depression the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) was used. Amitriptyline produced a statistically significant reduction of pain when compared to placebo. According to the global rating, 10 of the 15 patients were responders to this drug. The effect could already be noticed during the second treatment week and it appeared to be correlated to the plasma concentration, since the median total ami- and nortriptyline concentrations were 497 and 247 nmol/l, respectively, for responders and non-responders. The early onset, together with the fact that the patients were not depressed, nor did they obtain reduced scores on ratings of depressive symptoms and signs, provides strong support for the conclusion that the pain relief was not caused by an antidepressive effect. Five of the 14 patients treated with carbamazepine reported some pain relief, but the effect did not reach statistical significance when compared to placebo. No correlation was found between effect and plasma concentration. In general, the patients tolerated the planned final dose of amitriptyline well. No final dose reduction was necessary. Carbamazepine caused more side effects and the final dose had to be reduced in 4 patients. However, only 1 patient had to be taken off medication, on day 25, due to drug interaction.\r"

To evaluate the placebo effect and its duration, the treatment was given for 4 successive cycles. Whereas the antiprostaglandin agents were effective in most of the patients (in 80% of the pirprofen group and 85.7% of the naproxen group) and this efficacy was maintained throughout the study, a favorable response to placebo was observed in 84% in the first cycle, 29% in the second, 16% in the third and 10% in the fourth. The incidence of side effects was similar in the placebo and the active treatment groups (35.4% vs. 37.5%). It is postulated that a placebo effect in dysmenorrhea is due to a central analgesic mechanism mediated by endorphin release or possibly to psychological dynamics (mental or conditioning theories). However, this effect loses efficacy with time possibly due to a decreased susceptibility to the opioid action of the central nervous circuits responsible for menstrual pain perception or to deconditioning mechanisms.\r"

In addition, follow-up studies of chronic pain sufferers have come from specialized pain clinics and have ignored the question of how representative this special group is to the general population who suffer persistent pain. Because health care planners are assumed to require these data for projection of health care needs, it is important to determine the course of persistent pain in those persistent pain sufferers in the general population as well as those referred to a specialty clinic. An epidemiological study compared 2 groups of self-reported persistent pain sufferers from a Family Practice Clinic and a Specialty Pain Clinic over a 2 year period. All subjects reporting a persistent problem with pain at the time of the initial survey were contacted 2 years later to determine whether the initial differences between the 2 groups remained constant over time and whether there were any changes within each group over time. Despite the similarities between the study groups on multiple socioeconomic and demographic variables, the Specialty Pain Clinic group remained distinctly different from the Family Practice pain sufferers on many pain behavior and emotional variables. Thirteen percent of the persistent pain sufferers from the Pain Clinic group and 36% of the persistent pain sufferers from the Family Practice group no longer reported pain as a problem at follow-up. Of those pain sufferers from either group who continued to experience pain at 2 years follow-up, their pain became more intermittent, psychological distress factors improved, and the use of health services decreased. The implications are that persistent pain does not necessarily continue forever and that persistent pain sufferers in the general population have a better prognosis than those who are referred to a Specialty Pain Clinic. All follow-up studies need to be interpreted in light of these findings.\r"

All patients were seen by a physician who evaluated the extent of the pain arising from physical, psychiatric and psychological causes, and by a psychiatrist, who administered a structured interview schedule. Thirty-two percent of the patients had sufficient symptoms to be classified as psychiatric cases on the Present State Examination (PSE), a further 22% had minor neurotic symptoms and features of illness behaviour, 35% were categorized as organic, and 11% were unclassified. The Leeds General Depression Scale for Depression and Anxiety and the Beck Depression Inventory were the most effective of the psychiatric questionnaires used in separating the psychiatric patients from the remainder, and can be recommended as screening instruments for psychiatric illness in this population. Factors associated with a psychiatric diagnosis included female sex, larger number of present medications, greater reduction in activities compared to the period before the pain developed and increasing subjective pain from the onset of this.\r"

The sample consisted of 73 patients from a heterogeneous pain population admitted to the Victoria General Hospital Pain Management Unit. Patients completed a comprehensive pain evaluation battery that included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). They rated their loss of desire and ability for various social and recreational activities, and the intensity of their pain for 8 periods of a typical day. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to assess the sensory, affective, and evaluative indices of the MPQ, daily pain intensity ratings, and reported impairment of activities of non-depressed, mildly depressed and moderate/severely depressed patients. The results indicate significant relationships between the degree of depression and (a) the number of sensory descriptors endorsed on the MPQ; (b) pain intensity ratings in the late evening and at bedtime; and (c) reported loss of ability for social and recreational activities. Depression is related to loss of desire for activity in women, but not in men. A discriminant analysis suggests that depressed and non-depressed pain patients can be distinguished with 78% accuracy on the basis of their MPQ Sensory scores, reported loss of ability for activities, and global pain ratings at late evening and bedtime. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research as well as for the assessment and treatment of chronic pain patients.\r"

The results of administration and cessation of lidocaine and carbamazepine strongly suggest that a neurogenic component contributed to the severity of this patient's pain. This was also supported by a long period of previous sensory and motor loss in the upper limb and upper chest wall. Initially pain relief was attainable with a combination of oral carbamazepine and oral hydromorphone. However, as the patient's condition worsened, this combination produced only partial pain relief. Complete relief of the patient's pain was then attained only with a combination of epidural hydromorphone and oral carbamazepine. Hydromorphone was administered via an implanted, externalized silastic epidural catheter and infused by a miniaturized battery-operated pump which permitted a background infusion and the administration of patient and family-delivered boli. With this combination of oral carbamazepine and epidural hydromorphone, the patient was able to obtain complete pain relief for a period of 3 months until the time of death.\r"

Extraverts did not differ from introverts in visual analogue scale (VAS) sensory or VAS affective ratings of graded 5-sec nociceptive temperature stimuli (43-51 degrees C) nor in VAS sensory-VAS affective relationships related to their clinical pain. However, high extravert patients scored lower on affective inhibition (Pilowsky Illness Behavior Questionnaire; IBQ) compared to low extravert patients. This result is consistent with previous suggestions that extraverts inhibit overt expressions of suffering less than do introverts. High neurotic patients did not differ from low neurotic patients in their VAS sensory ratings of either experimental or clinical pain. Their VAS affective ratings of both types of pain were marginally higher as compared to low neurotic patients. As hypothesized, high neurotic score patients gave higher VAS ratings of emotions related to suffering and scored higher on items related to affective disturbance on the IBQ as compared to low neurotic score patients. Overall, the results indicate that the personality traits of neither extraversion nor neuroticism affect sensory mechanisms of nociceptive processing but appear to exert their influence by means of cognitive processes related to the ways in which people constitute the meanings and implications of pain.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether episodes of acute low-back pain prior to pregnancy is a predictor of low-back pain during labour. 114 women received the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) during labour and were asked to describe the pain separately for front and back contraction pain or continuous pain. The day after the birth of the child the women were interviewed to determine whether they had (a) a history of episodes of acute low-back pain before pregnancy, (b) low-back pain during pregnancy, and (c) low-back pain during menstruation. The results show that episodic low-back pain before pregnancy is not correlated with any aspect of labour pain. However, it is significantly correlated with episodes of low-back pain during pregnancy. In contrast, low-back pain during menstruation is significantly correlated with labour pain scores recorded for back and front contraction pain as well as for continuous back pain. The significant correlation of labour pain with back pain during menstruation suggests that both share a common underlying mechanism. Similarly, the correlation of low-back pain during pregnancy with episodes of acute low-back pain before pregnancy suggests that the strain on back muscles during pregnancy may activate the mechanisms that underlie the usual forms of low-back pain.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated that humans report heat stimuli as less painful when presented concurrently with a second noxious stimulus applied to another part of the body. Previous neurophysiological studies have shown that similar heterotopically applied noxious stimuli selectively and completely inhibit the activity of wide-dynamic-range (WDR) neurons in the dorsal horn - a phenomenon termed diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs). Taken together, these 2 lines of evidence suggest that activation of WDR cells may be necessary for normal perception of pain. Recent studies in the behaving monkey have additionally shown that WDR neurons respond to small changes in noxious heat stimuli better than do high threshold neurons, thus indicating a more specific role for WDR neurons in sensory-discriminative aspects of pain perception. If DNICs do indeed selectively and completely inhibit the activity of WDR neurons, then a heterotopically applied noxious stimulus should selectively interfere with a subject's ability to discriminate noxious stimuli. This hypothesis was tested using a noxious heat discrimination task and a cold water (5 degrees C) diffuse noxious stimulus. We found that the ability to detect small changes (0.4-0.8 degrees C) in painful heat stimuli applied to the face decreases when the person's hand is submerged in painfully cold water (P = 0.005) and that this effect persists, to a lesser extent, after the hand is removed from water. Control tasks, using visual stimuli, demonstrated that the modulation of nociceptive discrimination was not a generalized effect on sensory perception; other control measures indicated that the results could not be attributed to distraction, fatigue or changes in response bias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Certain pathological types of afferent input are supposed to lead to long-term changes in the responsiveness of dorsal horn neurones. This mechanism might be of importance for the development of neurological disturbances such as chronic pain. The present study was undertaken in order to find out whether dorsal horn neurones--particularly those processing input from deep tissues--exhibit long-lasting changes in response behaviour after a short-lasting noxious stimulation of deep tissue. In anaesthetized cats, the impulse activity of single dorsal horn cells was recorded extracellularly with glass microelectrodes. In a small number of cells that had multiple receptive fields (RFs), the algesic agent bradykinin was injected into a muscle RF and the properties of all RFs retested at regular time intervals. Following noxious chemical stimulation of one RF, the injected and the other RFs of the same neurone often showed changes which consisted of an increase in size, a lowering of mechanical threshold and appearance of new RFs. In an attempt to assess the influence of a single noxious stimulus on the entire population of dorsal horn cells, the properties of a greater sample of neurones were compared before and after injection of bradykinin into the deep tissues of the hind limb. Every cell encountered was classified as being driven by (1) cutaneous receptors only, (2) deep receptors only, (3) both input sources, or (4) electrical stimulation only (cell without receptive field). Following injection of bradykinin, the proportion of cells with both deep and cutaneous input and of those having background activity rose, and the percentage of cells without a receptive field decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Studies were performed using a behavioural test, measuring the threshold stimulus necessary to elicit vocalization by gradually increasing pressure applied to the paw. When administered (s.c., in the CAR-injected paw) either 20 min before, simultaneously or 20 min after CAR, ICS (10(-11) mol/kg, i.e., 3.2 ng/kg) completely prevented the hyperalgesia in both the injected and non-injected hind paws. This effect was prolonged for 90 min, equivalent to the effect on CAR on 5-HT release. Moreover, ICS increased the vocalization threshold over the pre-drug values in normal and CAR-treated rats when injected both 20 min before and simultaneously with the polysaccharide. On the contrary, it did not reduce the hyperalgesia, when injected 2 h after CAR. ICS had no effect at any time of administration on paw oedema. These results suggest that the early inflammatory sensitization of peripheral nociceptors is mainly dependent on the release of serotonin and that the hyperalgesic effect of the monoamine involves 5-HT3(M) receptors which do not seem to be involved in the early development of oedema.\r"

Buspirone (up to 25 mg/kg) and diazepam (up to 5 mg/kg) neither change the tail flick latency nor potentiate the action of morphine on the test. A buspirone dose of 2 mg/kg administered to animals before foot shock, or the dose of 1.5 mg/kg before cold swimming stress, led to a significant increase in hot plate latency 1 min after stress as compared to the control. The effect of buspirone on the paw lick reaction in rats may be related to the activation of antinociceptive mechanisms and inhibition of an emotional-motivational component of the pain reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Apomorphine, when administered intracerebroventricularly (0.05 mg/kg) to rats, increased tail-flick latency (a spinal nociceptive response). However, intraperitoneal administration at doses of 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg had no effect, probably because of a tonic supraspinal inhibitory influence on spinal dopaminergic neurones involved in segmental nociceptive processes. Depending on the doses administered, intraperitoneal administration of apomorphine exhibited opposite effects on antinociceptive activity of morphine. Pretreatment with a low dose of apomorphine (1 mg/kg) attenuated, whereas, a high dose (10 mg/kg) potentiated morphine-induced antinociception. Dopamine antagonists, in doses that preferentially block autoreceptors, i.e., haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and (-)-sulpiride (5 mg/kg, i.p.), antagonised the attenuation of morphine antinociception by a low dose of apomorphine, while treatment with a high dose of haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and pimozide (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.) completely antagonised the potentiating effect of a high dose of apomorphine on the antinociceptive activity of morphine. The attenuation of morphine antinociception thus appears to be due to decreased dopaminergic activity as a result of preferential dopamine autoreceptor stimulation by a low dose of apomorphine, whereas potentiation with a high dose of apomorphine is caused by enhanced dopaminergic activity via postsynaptic receptor stimulation.\r"

Of the community's 33 pediatricians, 94% responded to items in a 45-minute structured interview, for which test-retest reliability was demonstrated. Systematic differences in the care of physicians' children included delayed help seeking and increased self-referral to specialists by parents, and poor documentation of psychosocial history, less detailed instruction giving, and a reluctance to discuss problem behavior by pediatricians. Reasons cited by pediatricians for these problems included inappropriate assumptions concerning the medical knowledge of the physician's family, confusion between the roles of healer and help seeker, and embarrassment about discussing personal issues with colleagues.

Of these, 97 patients were recruited prospectively. The patients' ages ranged from 1 month to 18 years (mean, 5.0 years). The cause of the status epilepticus was classified as idiopathic in 46 cases, remote symptomatic in 45, febrile in 46, acute symptomatic in 45, and progressive neurologic in 11. The mortality and incidence of sequelae following status epilepticus was low and primarily a function of etiology. Seven children died within 3 months of having the seizure. New neurologic deficits were found in 17 (9.1%) of the 186 survivors. All of the deaths and 15 of the 17 sequelae occurred in the 56 children with acute or progressive neurologic insults. Only two of the 137 children with other causes sustained any new deficits (P less than .001). Duration of the status epilepticus affected outcome only within the acute symptomatic group (P less than .05). Neurologic sequelae occurred in 29% of infants younger than 1 year of age, 11% of children 1 to 3 years of age, and 6% of children older than 3 years of age. However, this was a reflection of the greater incidence of acute neurologic disease in the younger age groups. Within each cause, age did not affect outcome. Of the 193 children, 61 (32%) had a history of prior unprovoked seizures. Of the 125 surviving children with no history of prior unprovoked seizures, 37 (30%) had subsequent unprovoked seizures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective, randomized study of 18 infants treated with bovine surfactant (surfactant TA, Tokyo Tanabe Co, Tokyo) for severe respiratory distress syndrome, a lasting response was found in 12 infants (66%), a transient response was found in two (11%), and no response was found in four (22%) when arterial to alveolar PO2 ratios were used to define responses during the first 48 hours after treatment. In contrast, three of 23 control infants (13%) had a transient or lasting \"response\" to sham treatment (Pediatrics 1987;79:31-37). To determine whether maldistribution of surfactant could explain lack of response or a transient response, surfactant TA was mixed with technetium-99m sulfur colloid (approximately 300 mu Ci per infant), and eight infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome were treated six to 58 hours after birth. Scintigraphy of the lungs was performed three to 15 hours after treatment. Although a lasting response was observed in three infants, a transient one in three, and no response in two, no gross maldistribution of the radioactive label was found. Either lung received from 37% to 62% of the total radioactivity. During the past 3 years, in all infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome who were treated with surfactant (n = 29), poor or transient responses were associated with early patent ductus arteriosus and air leaks (pulmonary interstitial emphysema and pneumothoraces). Pathophysiologic conditions associated with respiratory distress syndrome are more likely to explain suboptimal responses after surfactant treatment than gross maldistribution of surfactant in the lungs.\r"

  ".W": "There are some children whose parents believe them to be unusually susceptible to medical or developmental problems--\"vulnerable\"--despite a lack of objective evidence of any difficulty. The \"vulnerable child syndrome\" refers to a constellation of behaviors that are thought to develop as a result of this excessive parental anxiety and subsequent difficulties in limit setting. In this study, the sense of vulnerability expressed by mothers concerning their healthy 3-year-old children is explored; children born prematurely and with considerable neonatal morbidity are compared with children born at full-term. Sense of vulnerability is assessed through the use of a simple instrument, the use and validity of which are described. Mothers of premature infants described a significantly greater sense of vulnerability concerning their children than did mothers of full-term infants. Mothers with more education described a greater sense of vulnerability than did less well-educated mothers, although mothers who claimed greater well-being and marital satisfaction described a lesser sense of vulnerability. Mothers with a greater sense of vulnerability concerning their children also reported more behavior problems, especially in the sphere of discipline, peer relationships and self-control, and in internalizing and somatic symptoms. Pediatricians can intervene in the development of the vulnerable child syndrome by recognizing those children at special risk and helping their parents to nurture their health and independence.\r"

To determine the value of the pneumogram as a predictor of outcome in this population, the first pneumogram obtained of 51 such infants was analyzed. The infants were grouped on the basis of subsequent outcome during a course of monitoring: group 1--infants who died during a subsequent event; group 2--infants who received resuscitation or vigorous stimulation to terminate a subsequent spell; group 3--infants who survived and did not have a significant subsequent episode. The results for these infants were compared with those of a control group matched for age and sex. A detailed, blinded computer analysis revealed no significant difference in the results of the pneumogram analysis between the three groups. It did not identify the infants in whom apneic spells necessitating resuscitation subsequently developed or those who died. However, when compared with the control group, infants with apnea of infancy had significantly higher mean respiratory rates, heart rates, and tachycardia indexes. It is concluded that, although the first pneumogram does not predict the risk of an adverse outcome in a population of infants with severe apnea of infancy, it does reveal subtle cardiorespiratory differences between study and control infants.\r"

For the group that failed at 30 dB hearing level, 80% of those who were abnormal at follow-up were considered to have conductive hearing disorders and 20% had mild sensorineural hearing impairments. In addition, infants enrolled in a parent-infant program for hearing impaired by 6 months of age were from the ABR program; however, several infants entered the parent-infant program at a relatively late age because they did not meet the high-risk criteria, they were from other hospitals, or they were not detected by the ABR program.\r"

The high school students reported an exaggerated concern with obesity regardless of their body weight or nutrition knowledge. Underweight, normal weight, and overweight girls were dieting to lose weight and reported frequent self-weighing practices. As many as 51% (n = 60) of the underweight adolescents described themselves as extremely fearful of being overweight and 36% (n = 43) were preoccupied with body fat. A distorted perception of ideal body weight was documented, particularly among the underweight students; the greater the underestimation of perceived ideal body weight, the greater the actual deficit in ideal body weight for height of the students (r = .73; P less than .001). Normal weight and overweight girls had better concordance between their actual and perceived ideal body weight for height. The frequency of bingeing and vomiting behaviors was similar among the three weight categories. The data suggest that fear of obesity and inappropriate eating behaviors are pervasive among adolescent girls regardless of body weight or nutrition knowledge.\r"

It is proposed that the carbohydrate residues function as general minor groove binding elements, and the stereochemistry of aglycone attachment sites is generally disposed to promote a right-handed helical geometry that is complementary to right-handed DNA. The constitution and stereochemistry of the DNA double-strand cleaving agent calichemicin gamma 1 is consistent with this analysis. Docking experiments with computer-generated models of this drug and a dodecamer duplex that was found to serve as a calichemicin cleavage site were performed to gain insight into the origin of the drug's sequence-selective binding and cutting properties. A model is presented that provides a molecular level understanding of the double-strand cleavage patterns that result from the action of calichemicin gamma 1 on DNA.\r"

Plasmin digests of fibrin clots that had first been covalently crosslinked by plasma transglutaminase (factor XIIIa) contained multimeric proteolytic fragments composed of crosslinked outer (D) domains of neighboring fibrin molecules. Two of these were larger than the well-known \"D dimer\" fragment and corresponded to D trimers and D tetramers, respectively. Whereas D dimers originate from crosslinked D domains at bimolecular junctions within two-stranded fibrils, D trimers and D tetramers evidently arise through crosslinking of contiguous D domains at trimolecular and tetramolecular junctions or at fibril branch points, respectively. Measurement of the widths of fibrils comprising trifunctional branches in thin fiber networks revealed tetramolecular branch points, which are formed by bifurcation of two double-stranded fibrils. In addition, another type of trifunctional structure, which we term the trimolecular branch point, was composed of three double-stranded fibrils. Crosslinking of D domains to form trimers may occur at this type of junction. These findings add to our understanding of the crosslinking arrangements that stabilize fibrin clot structure and the ways that fibrin molecules polymerize to form branches in the clot matrix.\r"

To identify the cis-regulatory elements conferring the differential gene expression, PEPCK chimeric genes were transfected into two rat hepatoma cell lines (H4IIEC3 and HTC-M1.1) and mouse adipocytes (3T3F442A), which express the endogenous gene, and into myoblasts and preadipocytes, which do not express it. The results demonstrate that 597 base pairs of the 5' flanking region of the PEPCK gene are sufficient to confer cell-specific gene expression in the PEPCK-expressing hepatoma cells and adipocytes. However, different elements within this 597-base-pair region enhance the gene expression in the hepatoma cells (endoderm) and adipocytes (mesoderm). In the hepatocytes, expression is conferred by two elements--one 5' of position -362 and the other 3' of position -98 with respect to the transcription start site. The region in between these two elements (from -362 to -98), which seems to inhibit the gene expression in the hepatocytes, confers enhanced expression in the adipocytes. Moreover, the distal positive regulatory element of the hepatocytes seems to be orientation and PEPCK promoter dependent. In contrast, the positive regulatory element of the adipocytes seems to act as a more typical enhancer. These results suggest that separate cis-regulatory elements confer cell-specific expression of the PEPCK gene.\r"

The hormonal response of a particular gene in vivo correlates with binding of the hormone to the receptor and supposedly reflects the degree of occupancy of the corresponding DNA regulatory sequences. However, in vitro the steroid-free glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors bind specifically to the regulatory sequences of mouse mammary tumor virus, thus raising questions on the role of the hormone in DNA binding in vivo. By using monoclonal antibodies, gel retardation assays, and filter binding techniques we show here that binding of a functional steroid to either the glucocorticoid or the progesterone receptors influences the kinetics of the protein-DNA interaction in vitro. In the presence of hormone the on rate of receptor binding to DNA fragments with or without regulatory sequences is accelerated 2- to 5-fold, and the off rate is accelerated 10- to 20-fold. The receptors complexed to an antihormone bind to DNA with kinetics intermediate between those of the steroid-free and the hormone-bound protein. Thus, ligand binding accelerates the kinetics of receptor binding to DNA and this could partly account for the behavior of the hormone receptor observed in vivo.\r"

The levels of mRNA coding for LDL-R and HMG-CoA reductase increased soon after induction, reached a maximum (12- and 7-fold increase, respectively) in 2-3 hr, and then rapidly returned to the low constitutive levels observed before induction. The stability of LDL-R mRNA did not change significantly during differentiation, whereas that of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA decreased by about 5-fold 6 hr after the addition of PMA. Transcriptional induction of both LDL-R and HMG-CoA reductase genes (5.6- and 2-fold, respectively) was also observed when undifferentiated cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), resulting in a transient increase in steady-state mRNA (7- and 3-fold, respectively). These results suggest that expression of the two genes is maintained at low constitutive levels in uninduced THP-1 cells by a protein with a short half-life. Superinduction of both genes occurred when PMA and CHX were added simultaneously. The induction of LDL-R and HMG-CoA reductase mRNAs during early macrophage differentiation is mediated by protein kinase C. It is hypothesized that protein kinase C acts directly or indirectly to inactivate the labile negative regulatory protein. Induction of LDL-R mRNA was also observed when the human hepatocarcinoma cell line Hep G2 was treated with PMA and CHX, suggesting that this mechanism of regulation may exist in several cell types.\r"

Several DNA-binding proteins were induced in HeLa cells after UV irradiation. These included proteins that bind predominantly double-stranded DNA and proteins that bind both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. The binding proteins were induced in a dose-dependent manner by UV light. Following a dose of 12 J/m2, the binding proteins in the nuclear extracts increased over time to a peak in the range of 18 hr after irradiation. Experiments with metabolic inhibitors (cycloheximide and actinomycin D) revealed that de novo synthesis of these proteins is not required for induction of the binding activities, suggesting that the induction is mediated by protein modification.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro amplification of biologically important nucleic acids has proceeded principally by a strategy of DNA replication. Polymerase chain reaction was the first such protocol to achieve this goal. In this report, a transcription-based amplification system (TAS) is described. Each cycle of the TAS is composed of two steps. The first is a cDNA synthesis step that produces one copy of a double-stranded DNA template for each copy of RNA or DNA target nucleic acid. During the course of this cDNA synthesis step, a sequence recognized by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is inserted into the cDNA copy of the target sequence to be amplified. The second step is the amplification of the target sequence by the transcription of the cDNA template into multiple copies of RNA. This procedure has been applied to the detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected cells. After four cycles of TAS, the amplification of the vif region of the HIV-1 RNA genome was measured to be, on the average, 38- to 47-fold per cycle, resulting in a 2-5 x 10(6)-fold increase in the copy number of the original target sequence. This amplification by the TAS protocol allows the detection of fewer than one HIV-1-infected CEM cell in a population of 10(6) uninfected CEM cells. Detection of the TAS-generated RNA from HIV-1-infected cells can easily be accomplished by means of a bead-based sandwich hybridization protocol, which provides additional specificity for the identification of the amplified HIV-1-specific sequence.\r"

We present a method that can be applied to the problem of identifying the recognition pattern for a DNA-binding protein given only a collection of sequenced DNA fragments, each known to contain somewhere within it a binding site for that protein. Information about the position or orientation of the binding sites within those fragments is not needed. The method compares the \"information content\" of a large number of possible binding site alignments to arrive at a matrix representation of the binding site pattern. The specificity of the protein is represented as a matrix, rather than a consensus sequence, allowing patterns that are typical of regulatory protein-binding sites to be identified. The reliability of the method improves as the number of sequences increases, but the time required increases only linearly with the number of sequences. An example, using known cAMP receptor protein-binding sites, illustrates the method.\r"

  ".W": "Induction of Agrobacterium tumefaciens vir gene expression by wounded plant cells results in production of a free transferable single-stranded (ss) copy of T-DNA, the T-strand. One of the Vir proteins, the VirE2 polypeptide, is a ssDNA-binding protein. In the present work, interaction of nopaline-specific VirE2 protein (Mr 69,000) with ssDNA was studied by using nitrocellulose filter binding, gel retardation, and electron microscopy techniques. The VirE2 protein was found to bind to ssDNA molecules with strong cooperativity, forming VirE2-ssDNA complexes with a binding site of 28-30 nucleotides. The VirE2-ssDNA complexes are stable at high salt concentrations and resistant to exonucleolytic activity. When examined under the electron microscope, the VirE2 protein converted collapsed free ssDNA molecules into unfolded and extended structures. The structure and properties of VirE2-ssDNA complexes predict possible functions in Agrobacterium virulence to (i) protect the T-strands from cellular nucleases and (ii) facilitate transfer of the T-strands through bacterial membranes possibly by specific interaction with putative membrane pores formed in plant-induced Agrobacterium cells.\r"

  ".W": "The highly conserved interferon (IFN)-stimulated regulatory elements of the human genes 6-16 and 9-27 bind to one or more proteins (E factor) detected in extracts of human Bristol 8 B cells or human foreskin fibroblast cells treated with IFN-alpha. E factor is not detectable in extracts of untreated cells and appears in IFN-treated cells within less than 1 min in a form extractable with low salt and thus presumably not bound to DNA. After a few more minutes, the level of this form decreases in parallel with the increase of a form extractable only with high salt and thus presumably bound to DNA. Induction of E factor by IFN-alpha can occur in nuclei-free cytoplasts, whereas no E factor was detected in IFN-treated nucleoplasts. Together, these results suggest a model for signal transduction in which latent E factor, located in the cytoplasm, is activated or released from an inhibitor very rapidly upon binding of IFN-alpha to its receptor. Active E factor can then migrate to the nucleus, where it binds to the IFN-stimulated regulatory elements of IFN-regulated genes, activating their transcription.\r"

ICI 164,384 behaved as a pure antagonist, whereas hydroxytamoxifen was a partial agonist-antagonist. The estrogen-responsive element of the pS2 gene has been narrowed down by site-directed deletion mutagenesis to a 13-base-pair (position -405 to position -393) imperfectly palindromic sequence, which in isolation can confer estrogen inducibility to the heterologous rabbit beta-globin gene promoter. On the other hand, the sequences responsible for the constitutive enhancer activity are spread over the entire region.\r"

  ".U": "89145216\r", 
  ".W": "To help elucidate the general rules of equilibrium globular protein folding, dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a model beta-barrel globular protein having the six-stranded Greek key motif characteristic of real globular proteins were undertaken. The model protein possesses a typical beta-barrel amino acid sequence; however, all residues of a given type (e.g. hydrophobic residues) are identical. Even in the absence of site-specific interactions, starting from a high-temperature denatured state, these models undergo an all-or-none transition to a structurally unique six-stranded beta-barrel. These simulations suggest that the general rules of globular protein folding are rather robust in that the overall tertiary structure is determined by the general pattern of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and turn-type residues, with site-specific interactions mainly involved in structural fine tuning of a given topology. Finally, these studies suggest that loops may play an important role in producing a unique native state. Depending on the stability of the native conformation of the long loop in the Greek key, the conformational transition can be described by a two-state, three-state, or even larger number of multiple equilibrium states model.\r"

The structure predicted from a hydropathy plot contains at least eight transmembrane segments, with most of the protein (73%) extending into the cytoplasm and only 5% of the residues exposed on the external surface.

The library was screened with synthetic oligonucleotides that encode the NH2-terminal sequence of this enzyme. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA inserts revealed a 1761-base-pair open reading frame that encoded an NH2-terminal signal peptide of 33 amino acids and a mature enzyme of 554 amino acids (Mr, 62,258). The amino acid sequence deduced from nucleotide sequence analysis agrees with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified ascorbate oxidase, as determined by microsequencing methods. Cucumber ascorbate oxidase contained four histidine-rich regions with striking sequence homology to the corresponding parts of the other multicopper oxidases such as Neurospora crassa laccase and human ceruloplasmin and, to some extent, to a low molecular weight copper protein such as plastocyanin. Moreover, these data further support the hypothesis that the small blue copper proteins and the multicopper oxidases have evolved from the same ancestral gene. By RNA blot hybridization analysis, the mRNA for the ascorbate oxidase was found to be abundant in cucumber fruit tissue while expressed at very low levels in leaf and root tissues.\r"

This spatial-temporal Fourier analysis was tested on a series of well-characterized animal tumor cell lines of rat prostatic cancer to study in a quantitative manner the correlation of cell motility with increasing in vivo metastatic potential. Fourier motility coefficients measuring pseudopodal extension correlated best with metastatic potential in the cell lines studied. This study demonstrated that Fourier analysis provides quantitative measurement of cell motility that may be applied to the study of biological processes. This analysis should aid in the study of the motility of individual cells in various areas of cellular and tumor biology.\r"

To study the biochemical mechanism for H2O2 production, we have isolated an NADPH-specific oxidase fraction from homogenates of unfertilized Strongylocentrotus purpuratus eggs that produces H2O2 when stimulated with Ca2+ and MgATP2-. Concentrations of free Ca2+ previously implicated in regulation of egg activation modulate the activity of the oxidase. Inhibitors were used to test the relevance of this oxidase to the respiratory burst of fertilization. Procaine, two phenothiazines, and N-ethylmaleimide (but not iodoacetamide) inhibited H2O2 production by the oxidase fraction and oxygen consumption by activated eggs. The ATP requirement suggested that protein kinase activity might regulate the respiratory burst of fertilization; consonant with this hypothesis, H-7 and staurosporine were inhibitory. The respiratory burst oxidase of fertilization is an NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase that appears to be regulated by a protein kinase; although it bears a remarkable resemblance to the neutrophil oxidase, unlike the latter it does not form O2- as its initial product.\r"

Most of the coding region of the human gene consists of a modern segment of repeats derived from a 10-codon sequence present in the ancestral segment of the gene. The modern segment can be divided into early, middle, and late regions. We report here the nucleotide sequence of three alleles of the gorilla involucrin gene. Each possesses a modern segment homologous to that of the human and consisting of 10-codon repeats. The early and middle regions are similar to the corresponding regions of the human allele and are nearly identical among the different gorilla alleles. The late region consists of recent duplications whose pattern is unique in each of the gorilla alleles and in the human allele. The early region is located in what is now the 3' third of the modern segment, and the late, polymorphic region is located in what is now the 5' third. Therefore, as the modern segment expanded during evolution, its 3' end became stabilized, and continuing duplications became confined to its 5' end. The expansion of the involucrin coding region, which began long before the separation of the gorilla and human, has continued in both species after their separation.\r"

However, we were highly successful in identifying three additional alleles of the characterized mdx locus. These alleles of mdx were recovered from various mutagen-treated males and they occur on an X chromosome that carries flanking markers that allow us to follow the mutations in genetic crosses and in the development of corresponding mutant stocks. These alleles have been designated as mdx2Cv, mdx3Cv, and mdx4Cv. Preliminary data show that mice with mdx2Cv and mdx3Cv mutations have muscular dystrophic phenotypes that do not grossly differ from the characterized mdx mutation. These additional mdx mutations expand the value of mouse models of X chromosome-linked muscular dystrophy and potentially define additional sites of mutation that impair dystrophin expression.\r"

Surviving cells were scored for surface expression of H-2Kb protein with in situ immunoperoxidase staining. Revertants were detected at a frequency of 3 X 10(-6) at a dose of 40 J/m2 (3-5% survival). Revertant genes, cloned by plasmid rescue, contained the expected thymine-to-cytosine transitions at the amber codon. These data show that revertants can be rapidly detected in mammalian cells without selection and provide a basis for the development of mammalian cell lines that could be used to study mutational phenomena. During this study the steady-state level of mRNA was reduced in L cells carrying the amber mutant H-2Kb gene compared with L cells containing a wild-type or revertant H-2Kb gene. This reduction was shown not to be due to transcriptional differences, suggesting that the amber mutation decreases stability of the H-2Kb mRNA.\r"

Peripheral blood lymphocytes from \"old\" male individuals and \"young\" controls were fused with a Chinese hamster cell line (CHO-YH21), yielding 10 HAT-resistant rodent-human clones from the old propositi and 22 from the young controls (HAT = hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine). Both series of hybrid clones were analyzed with respect to the retention of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the surface antigen MIC2 identified by monoclonal antibody 12E7, two human X chromosome-linked markers located at opposite ends of the X chromosome. Cell hybrid clones with an X chromosome from a young control retained both markers in about 70% of the cells. In contrast, cell hybrid clones with an X chromosome from an old donor retained the MIC2 marker in only 30% of their cells. Slot-blot hybridization studies have established that the observed loss of the MIC2 marker is due to loss of the coding gene, not to suppression of its expression. Similar hybridization studies with molecular probes specific for other regions of the X chromosome suggest preferential chromosomal breakage sites. T lymphocytes from old donors were also found to have an LD50 for aminopterine significantly lower than the concentration of this drug in the HAT medium used to grow the hybrids, suggesting that the higher level of gene loss observed in the X chromosomes from old donors may be directly related to their increased sensitivity to the clastogenic effect of aminopterine. We speculate that the higher rate of chromosomal breakage and of marker loss observed along the \"old-age\" X chromosomes could be the result of \"molecular scars\" accumulated with aging at sites of constitutive chromosomal fragility.\r"

By molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence comparison of a rhesus macaque alpha-globin gene to its homologs in man, orangutan, olive baboon, and other mammals, we demonstrate a burst of evolution of the baboon alpha-globin gene since its separation from the rhesus macaque. This mutation burst has occurred only at the nonsynonymous sites but not the synonymous sites. Its magnitude is at least 10-fold higher than the synonymous substitution rates in higher primates and as high as the synonymous substitution rates of the rodent lineage. On the contrary, the rate of synonymous site substitutions in the alpha-globin genes of either the rhesus macaque or the olive baboon is several times slower than that of human. Our data demonstrate an anomalous exception to the slow rates of molecular evolution in higher primates and provide strong evidence for a recently accelerated evolution of a primate globin gene under an as yet unknown selective force(s).\r"

The Xenopus C3 sequence shows clusters of high and of low similarity to the mammalian C3 sequences. One of these regions of high similarity represents the domain of mammalian C3b involved in the binding of properdin, a regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation. It is not clear whether the other highly conserved regions are involved in binding to other C3 ligands. The Xenopus C3 sequence completely lacks the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, which has been suggested to be the recognition site of the human complement receptor type 3 on the iC3b fragment of human C3. The Xenopus C3 gene is shown not to be linked to the Xenopus major histocompatibility complex, as is also the case in mammals.

Using a rabbit anti-serum to leukosialin, a cDNA clone was isolated from a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from human peripheral blood cells. This lambda gt11 clone was used to isolate longer cDNA clones that correspond to the entire coding sequence of leukosialin. DNA sequence analysis reveals three domains in the predicted mature protein. The extracellular domain is enriched for Ser, Thr, and Pro and contains four contiguous 18-amino acid repeats. The transmembrane and intracellular domains of the human leukosialin molecule are highly homologous to the rat W3/13 molecule. RNA gel blot analysis reveals two polyadenylylated species of 2.3 and 8 kilobases. Southern blot analysis suggests that human leukosialin is a single-copy gene. Analysis of monochromosomal cell hybrids indicates that the leukosialin gene is not X chromosome linked and in situ hybridization shows leukosialin is located on chromosome 16. These findings demonstrate that the primary mutation in WAS is not a defect in the structural gene for leukosialin.\r"

  ".W": "Sulfation of tyrosine residues recently has been recognized as a biosynthetic modification of many plasma proteins and other secretory proteins. Effects of this site-specific modification on protein function are not known, but the activity of several peptides such as cholecystokinin is greatly augmented by sulfation. Here, we examine the role of sulfation in the processing and activity of C4 (the fourth component of complement), one of the few proteins in which sites and stoichiometry of tyrosine sulfation have been characterized. Our results, with C4 as a paradigm, suggest that sulfation of tyrosine residues can have major effects on the activity of proteins participating in protein-protein interactions. Sulfation of C4 synthesized by Hep G2 cells was blocked by incubating the cells with NaClO3 and guaiacol. These sulfation inhibitors did not alter secretion or other steps in the processing of C4. However, hemolytic activity of C4 was decreased more than 50%. The inhibitors' effect on C4 activity was prevented by adding Na2SO4 to restore sulfation of C4. Activity of C3, a complement component homologous to C4 but lacking tyrosine sulfate residues, was minimally reduced (19%) by the inhibitors. Decreased hemolytic activity of nonsulfated C4 apparently resulted from impaired interaction with complement subcomponent C1s (EC 3.4.21.42), the protease that physiologically activates C4. Purified C1s was able to cleave nonsulfated C4, but approximately 10-fold higher concentrations of C1s were required for that cleavage than to yield equivalent cleavage of sulfated C4. Our results suggest that activation of C4, a central component in the classical pathway of complement activation, is influenced by the level of sulfation of the protein. Thus, sulfation of C4 provides a potential locus for physiological or pharmacological modulation of complement-mediated opsonization and inflammation.\r"

However, when eosinophils from these nine donors were maintained in culture with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and murine 3T3 fibroblasts, HLA-DR consistently developed on the eosinophils. By days 4-6 of culture, 24-97% of eosinophils were HLA-DR+, and the eosinophils remained morphologically mature. In contrast, another class II antigen, HLA-DQ, was not detectable by flow cytometry on eosinophils from eight of nine donors. Cultured eosinophils were able to synthesize HLA-DR, as documented by the incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoprecipitable HLA-DR heavy and light chains. These findings show that mature eosinophils can synthesize and express HLA-DR and provide a means whereby eosinophils may interact with CD4+ lymphocytes.\r"

Growth in medium deficient in thymidine caused cell death in two clones (TS- c1 and TS- c3), whereas one clone (TS- c2) showed limited growth. Growth correlated with thymidine synthase activity and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate-binding capacity and with incorporation of 2'-deoxy[6-3H]uridine into DNA. In the presence of optimal thymidine, growth rates were only 5-18% that of the parental clone (GC3/c1), which grew equally well in thymidine-deficient or -replete medium. Analysis of poly(A)+ RNA showed normal levels of a 1.6-kilobase transcript in TS- c1 and TS- c2 but decreased levels (approximately 6% control) in TS- c3. Clone TS- c3 was 32-, 750-, and greater than 100,000-fold more resistant than the parental clone to 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, and methotrexate, respectively. When inoculated into athymic nude mice, each TS- clone produced tumors, demonstrating continued ability to proliferate in vivo.\r"

Retrieval of stored food relies on an accurate and long-lasting spatial memory, and hippocampal damage disrupts memory for storage sites. The results suggest, therefore, that food-storing species of passerines have an enlarged hippocampal complex as a specialization associated with the use of a specialized memory capacity. Other life-history variables were examined and found not to be correlated with hippocampal volume.\r"

  ".W": "Parkinson disease is characterized by a major loss (approximately 80% or more) of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons and by an increased turnover of neurotransmitter by surviving neurons of the nigrostriatal tract. In theory, increased turnover of dopamine should be associated with an oxidative stress derived from increased production of hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide is formed during the oxidative deamination of dopamine by monoamine oxidase. In experiments with mice, increased presynaptic turnover of dopamine was evoked by injection of reserpine, which interferes with the storage of dopamine in synaptic vesicles. Loss of dopamine and formation of deaminated metabolites were accompanied by a significant rise (87.8%) in the level of oxidized glutathione in brain. This change was observed in the striatum, which is richly innervated by dopamine terminals, but not in the frontal cortex, which receives a much sparser innervation by catecholamine nerve terminals. The rise in oxidized glutathione was seen even though dopamine terminals constitute only 1% or less of the mass of the striatum. Clorgyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type A, blocked the formation of oxidized glutathione. These observations confirm that a selective increase in neurotransmitter turnover within nigrostriatal nerve terminals can evoke a change in cellular redox status. We suggest that an oxidative stress may play a role in the natural history of Parkinson disease.\r"

Multiple determinations were obtained in anesthetized and paralyzed animals using radiolabeled microspheres during (i) normocapnia-normotension, (ii) hypercapnia (5% CO2/95% room air), (iii) angiotensin-induced acute severe hypertension (190 greater than mean arterial blood pressure less than 210 mmHg), or (iv) bicuculline-induced seizures. Flow was symmetrical in all brain regions at rest and during increases induced by hypercapnia in the three groups. During severe hypertension or seizures, marked elevations developed bilaterally (approximately 93% and approximately 130%, respectively). In ganglionectomized animals, increases due to hypertension or seizures were attenuated by 28-32% on the denervated side within cortical gray matter regions corresponding to the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries. Flow was symmetrical within all brain regions in sham-operated animals and in the rhizotomy group, despite comparable increases in regional cerebral blood flow induced by angiotensin. Hence, the trigeminal nerve mediates blood flow adaptations during severe hypertension and seizures. Furthermore, since trigeminal cell bodies and peripheral axons are destroyed or degenerate following ganglionectomy but not following rhizotomy, local \"axon reflex-like\" mechanisms mediate these increases in cerebral blood flow.\r"

The maximum saturable binding capacity of the nerve was 16.2 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg of wet weight, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.88 +/- 0.18 nM (mean +/- SEM). These values correspond to a high-affinity saxitoxin-binding site density of approximately 2/microns 2 within premyelinated axon membrane. Action potential propagation in neonatal rat optic nerve is completely blocked by 5 nM saxitoxin, indicating that action potential electrogenesis is mediated by channels that correspond to high-affinity saxitoxin-binding sites. These results demonstrate that action potential conduction is supported by a low density of sodium channels in this system. Since the internodal axon membrane of myelinated fibers may contain a low density of sodium channels, it is possible that restoration of conduction in some demyelinated fibers may not require additional sodium channel incorporation into the demyelinated axon membrane.\r"

Stable lines of murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing H1 alone or H2 alone do not bind or internalize the ligand asialoorosomucoid (ASOR), which contains triantennary oligosaccharides. In contrast, cells expressing H1 and H2 together bind and degrade ASOR with properties indistinguishable from those of the ASGP-R in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Whether or not H2 is coexpressed, H1 is synthesized as a 40-kDa precursor bearing high-mannose oligosaccharides, processed to its mature 46-kDa form, and transported to the cell surface. In cells expressing only H1, homodimers and -trimers of H1 are formed. In contrast, when expressed in 3T3 cells without H1, H2 is synthesized as its 43-kDa precursor, bearing high-mannose oligosaccharides, but is rapidly degraded. When H1 and H2 are coexpressed in the same cell, the H1 polypeptide \"rescues\" the H2 polypeptide; H2 is processed to its characteristic 50-kDa mature form and is transported to the surface. We conclude that the human ASGP-R is a multichain heterooligomer, probably a trimer of H1 molecules in noncovalent association with one, two, or three H2 molecules, and that the two polypeptides normally interact early in biosynthesis.\r"

The purposes of this two-part study were to replicate essential parts of those studies and to further examine the reliability of these measurements in a clinical context. Repeated force measurements were taken from the nonparetic and paretic limbs of brain-damaged patients during the same testing session (Part 1) and during two testing sessions separated by two days (Part 2). The intratester intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for all measurements taken during a single session ranged from .88 to .98. The ICCs for repeated measurements taken two days apart from the paretic limbs ranged from .90 to .98. The ICCs for repeated measurements taken two days apart from the nonparetic limbs ranged from .31 to .93. The ICCs for repeated measurements taken two days apart from the combined data for all limbs ranged from .79 to .97. Hand-held dynamometer measurements taken on brain-damaged patients appear to be highly reliable when taken during the same testing session. When repeated measurements are separated by a longer time interval, the measurements taken from the paretic limbs continue to be highly reliable, whereas most measurements taken on the nonparetic limbs exhibit poor reliability.\r"

Activities-of-daily-living skill and gross motor performance contralateral to the lesions were compared among 32 left-sided and 19 right-sided hemiplegic subjects using analysis of variance and chi-square techniques. Ipsilateral to the damaged hemisphere, fine motor tasks of simple visual motor reaction time, grip and pinch strength, finger tapping, and Purdue Pegboard performance were tested. Analysis of covariance compared each ipsilateral task to performance in the corresponding hand of 70 matched controls. Results indicate similar long-term functional ADL outcome in right and left hemisphere-damaged subjects, despite more severe contralateral functional motor deficits following lesions of the left hemisphere. Right hemisphere lesions led to ipsilateral decrements in reaction time, and lesions of either hemisphere diminished grip or pinch strength, finger tapping, and pegboard performance ipsilaterally. These results demonstrate that unilateral brain damage involving the motor areas of either hemisphere has detrimental effects on ipsilateral upper extremity motor function. Findings are discussed and related to the concept that the left hemisphere is specialized or has greater neuronal representation for bilateral motor processes. Physical therapists involved in the treatment of patients with hemiplegia should be aware that motor functions of the ipsilateral, nonparetic upper extremity may also be affected adversely by unilateral brain lesions.\r"

The effect of an eight-week eccentric exercise program on quadriceps femoris muscle work was evaluated in four groups of subjects--two groups of \"normal\" (healthy) subjects and two groups of patients with patellar tendinitis. All four groups participated in a home muscle stretching exercise program, but only two groups--one group of normal subjects (N-A) and one group of subjects with tendinitis (T-A)--received additional eccentric training on an eccentric isokinetic dynamometer. The eccentric quadriceps femoris muscle work ratio (involved limb/uninvolved limb x 100) was used to quantify strength in the N-A and T-A Groups. Pain ratings were recorded for subjects with tendinitis before and after the eight-week experiment and were correlated with the dependent variable using a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient. The N-A Group performed significantly better than all subjects with tendinitis (p less than .05). Subjects in the T-A Group, however, showed a trend toward increasing eccentric quadriceps femoris muscle work capacity over the eight-week training period. As pain ratings in the T-A Group increased, work ratios decreased. We concluded that eccentric exercise may be an effective treatment for patellar tendinitis, but that knee pain may limit optimal gains in strength.\r"

The effect of knee position on passive joint stiffness was also evaluated by testing the subjects with the knee flexed (90 degrees) and with the knee extended (0 degrees). A torque motor system was used to record angular displacement and resistive torque during a 6 degrees/sec ankle rotation from 10 degrees of plantar flexion to 10 degrees of dorsiflexion (DF). Passive torque and passive elastic stiffness were measured at 0, 5, and 10 degrees of DF. Both measures increased nonlinearly as the ankle was rotated into DF, but showed no significant differences between the three age groups tested. There was also no significant difference in the passive stiffness measurements when the knee was flexed or extended. We concluded that within the range of motion tested, the factors of age and knee position do not affect the passive stiffness observed in the ankle joints of healthy women. We have now established baseline values of passive ankle joint stiffness for healthy women during DF within a functional ROM, which will be useful in the clinical evaluation of passive ankle joint stiffness and in studies where treatment efficacy is being investigated.\r"

In two dogs without paracentesis, increased pressure and blindness persisted.

  ".W": "The control of chronic drooling in cerebral palsy has been difficult in the past. Previous methods to control drooling include the Wilkie procedure, which diverts the salivary flow from the parotid glands by means of surgically created tunnels to the tonsillar fossa, along with submandibular gland resection. An alternative is submandibular gland resection with bilateral parotid duct ligation. Previous published studies using this method have resulted in good to excellent results, but population sizes were felt to be too small to be conclusive. Since 1979, a total of 58 patients have been treated by parotid duct ligation with submandibular gland resection, and 86 percent have shown good to excellent results. These results compare favorably with those published by Wilkie. Also, parotid duct ligation is technically easier, associated with less postoperative morbidity, and has shown a decreased duration of hospitalization compared to parotid duct transposition.\r"

This study attempted to clarify some of the controversy with respect to maxillofacial use of these implants. Maximal compressive force to torque values were measured in standardized bone thicknesses of 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm. The screws tested were pretapped AO 1.5-, 2.0-, 2.7-, and 3.5-mm rescue screws and self-tapping Luhr, Champy, and AO 1.5- and 2.0-mm screws. Ten measurements were made for each screw type/bone thickness combination using a piezoelectric washer and torque screwdriver. It was apparent that for 1- and 2-mm bone thicknesses the use of self-tapping screws resulted in the highest compression values. In 3- and 4-mm bone thicknesses, pretapped screws offered the highest compression values. As expected, self-tapping screws had the highest torque values on insertion owing to torque loss in cutting the screw threads. The 2.7-mm screw offered no advantage over the 2.0-mm screws in 1- and 2-mm bone thicknesses but resulted in higher compression values in 3- and 4-mm bone thicknesses.\r"

Four lesions (13 percent) virtually disappeared, ten (32 percent) showed greater than 50 percent reduction in volume, ten (32 percent) showed definite but less than 50 percent reduction in volume, and seven (23 percent) showed little or no decrease in size. None showed further growth. All injections were performed without anesthesia, and there were not significant complications. We conclude that intralesional corticosteroid injections are safe and effective in properly selected infants with hemangiomas.\r"

The superior pedicle technique of breast reduction is recognized by many as technically easier and capable of producing a longer-lasting aesthetic effect. Classically, however, it has been limited to smaller resections. By incorporating the medial quadrant in the superior pedicle, more aggressive reductions can be safely undertaken with the same excellent results. Details of the procedure, the anatomic basis for its success, and complications are discussed.\r"

Specifically, the patients were followed in the clinic to determine the extent and degree of donor-site morbidity. Sixty-two flaps were transferred to the lower extremities, 15 to the head and neck, 2 to the arm, and 1 was placed intrathoracically. Osteomyelitis was the most common indication for free-muscle transfer in 33 patients, soft-tissue defects in 26, and facial soft-tissue augmentation in 14 patients. In the 80 rectus abdominis free-muscle transfers, there were 9 local complications. A seroma occurred in 4 patients, wound infection in 3, and an abdominal wall hernia occurred in 1 patient. The success rate for muscle transfer was 93 percent with six flap losses. Because there is a low incidence of donor-site complications, the surgical dissection is relatively easy, and the relative consistency and size of the deep inferior epigastric pedicle are good, the rectus abdominis muscular unit is now one of the most frequently used free-tissue transfers at our institution.\r"

Animals were sacrificed at intervals between 7 and 60 days, and the flaps were removed with the underlying muscular bed. Specimens were studied by tetracycline uptake, gel electrophoresis, light microscopy, and the scanning electron microscope. Osteoprogenitor cells were seen as early as 7 days after transfer. Collagen fiber deposition was vigorous and noted in all specimens with rapid mineralization by 9 to 15 days. There was no structural or vascular interaction between the flaps and the recipient muscular bed. Gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of type I and III collagen, with an increase in type I collagen over time. The pattern of collagen deposition and the final bony architecture resembled that of woven bone.\r"

In addition, symptomatology, diagnostic criteria, and guidelines for surgical management remain ill-defined. In the lower extremities, however, in situ vein bypass has been attempted for nearly three decades. This technique offers many advantages over traditional revascularization methods. Although the procedure has become popular for the lower extremity, no report of its use in the upper extremity is found in the literature. We report what may be the first case in which in situ bypass was used in the upper extremity for a threatened limb secondary to diabetic occlusive vascular disease complicated by a previous shunt used for hemodialysis. Revascularization of the upper extremity using the in situ vein bypass technique may offer a new alternative to traditional methods of revascularization.\r"

This region has historically been a difficult area to image with any modality, because of the detailed anatomy and numerous important structures that traverse it. Gadolinium-enhanced MR should provide a valuable tool in the evaluation and management of these patients. The evidence that gadolinium is useful in staging of primary and nodal squamous cell carcinoma of the extracranial head and neck is less apparent. Areas where gadolinium may be helpful include size and extent of primary tumor and internal architecture of nodes that do not meet size criteria for malignant adenopathy. This is an area in which more experience is necessary, employing careful correlation with enhanced CT, unenhanced MR, and surgical specimens. Posttreatment follow-up of head and neck squamous cell lesions is a potential use for gadolinium, but this too is yet to be adequately studied. We have found that gadolinium enhancement provides no additional information important to the management of benign head and neck lesions over enhanced CT or unenhanced MR.\r"

Stable adherence to and invasion of epithelial cells by S. choleraesuis and S. typhimurium were found to require de novo synthesis of several new bacterial proteins. This inducible event appears to be a coordinately regulated system dependent on trypsin- and neuraminidase-sensitive structures present on the epithelial cell surface. Mutants of S. choleraesuis and S. typhimurium were unable to synthesize these proteins and did not stably adhere to nor invade eukaryotic cells. Two such S. typhimurium mutants were avirulent in mice, an indication that these proteins are required for Salmonella virulence.\r"

Parameters measured included LV pressure (LVP) and maximal rate of LVP rise (+dP/dt max) and fall (-dP/dt max) at a constant preload (LV enddiastolic pressure [LVEDP]). Compared with young controls (ten), aged control hearts (ten) showed significantly lower LVP (87.4 +/- 2.53 versus 76.0 +/- 1.5, p,0.001), +dP/dt max (1,351 +/- 51 versus 1,048 +/- 49, p,0.001), and -dP/dt max (1,154 +/- 34 versus 916 +/- 27, p,0.001), at an LVEDP of 10 millimeters of mercury. A 43 +/- 2 per cent third-degree burn (Walker model) was studied in ten young and ten aged guinea pigs. Burned aged hearts showed significantly lower LVP (57.1 +/- 2.1 versus 67.5 +/- 3.7, p,0.01) and -dP/dt max (707 +/- 33 versus 993 +/- 59, p,0.001) at an LVEDP of 10 millimeters of mercury. In addition, LV function curves for burned aged hearts were shifted downward and to the right of curves obtained from young burned hearts (p,0.05). Contractile defects in the aged group were not overcome by altered beating frequency, increased extracellular calcium concentration, nor maximally effective increases in diastolic stretch. Finally, we examined the effects of fluid resuscitation (4 milliliters per kilogram per percentage of burns) on contractile function in an additional ten young and ten aged burned guinea pigs. Contractile deficits persisted in both age groups despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Peak LVP and maximal rate of relaxation (-dP/dt) were uniformly depressed in aged as compared with young burned hearts (52.4 +/- 1.5 versus 63.2 +/- 2.7 and 715 +/- 42 versus 909 +/- 52, p,0.01, respectively). These data suggest that severe myocardial contractile change resulting from a major thermal insult in subjects with already compromised hearts is likely a significant limiting factor in the response to burn shock and adequate fluid resuscitation.\r"

Fifteen were carried out at the initial laparotomy and 11 at a second look operation (SLO). Of the 112 patients who had a palliative bypass at the initial laparotomy, 30, who were less than 65 years of age and were fit and remained so when assessed at six and 12 weeks postoperatively, were re-evaluated for SLO. Of these, 12 had evidence of metastases and, therefore, were not considered for SLO. Eleven had a successful resection, and in seven, attempted resection had to be abandoned because of local invasion. The five year survival rate was 50 per cent for carcinoma of the periampullary region and 9 per cent for carcinoma of the head of the pancreas after primary resection. The comparable rates after SLO were 33.3 and 12.5 per cent, respectively. Based on our experience, SLO should be considered in young, fit patients as associated pancreatitis can make some tumors seem locally invasive and, hence, appear unresectable at the initial laparotomy.\r"

Twenty experiments were performed with each material, and observations were made at two, five, seven and ten weeks. The inflammatory response was minimal with all products. Adhesions were more marked with polypropylene (Marlex) than with polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-tex); there was no difference between the absorbable meshes. In vitro tensile strength measurements at ten weeks indicated that Marlex was superior to the other materials, and between the absorbable products, polyglactin (Vicryl) was superior to polyglycolic acid (Dexon). No hernias were observed with the nonabsorbable meshes, but all of the rabbits repaired with absorbable meshes had ventral hernias by the tenth week. Thus, absorbable meshes are not indicated when prolonged tensile strength is required, but they may be useful for other purposes, including the temporary repair of fascial defects, since evisceration was not observed.\r"

  ".W": "The bending stiffness of 22 commercial suture materials of varying size, chemical structure and physical form was quantitatively evaluated using a stiffness tester (Taber V-5, model 150B, Teledyne). The commercial sutures were Chromic catgut; Dexon (polyglycolic acid); Vicryl (polyglactin 910); PDS (polydioxanone); Maxon (polyglycolide-trimethylene carbonate); Silk (coated with silicone); Mersilene (polyester fiber); Tycron (polyester fiber); Ethibond (polyethylene terephthalate coated with polybutylene); Nurolon (nylon 66); Surgilon (nylon 66 coated with silicone); Ethilon (coated nylon 66), Prolene (polypropylene); Dermalene (polyethylene), and Gore-tex (polytetraflouroethylene). These are both natural and synthetic, absorbable and nonabsorbable and monofilament and multifilament sutures. All of these sutures were size 2-0, but Prolene sutures with sizes ranging from 1-0 to 9-0 were also tested to determine the effect of suture size on stiffness. The bending stiffness data obtained showed that a wide range of bending stiffness was observed among the 22 commercial sutures. The most flexible 2-0 suture was Gore-tex, followed by Dexon, Silk, Surgilon, Vicryl (uncoated), Tycron, Nurolon, Mersilene, Ethibond, Maxon, PDS, Ethilon, Prolene, Chromic catgut, coated Vicryl, and lastly, Dermalene. The large porous volume inherent in Gore-tex monofilament suture was the reason for its lowest flexural stiffness. Sutures with a braided structure were generally more flexible than those of a monofilament structure, irrespective of the chemical constituents. Coated sutures had significantly higher stiffness than the corresponding uncoated ones. This is particularly true when polymers rather than wax were used as the coating material. This increase in stiffness is attributable to the loss of mobility under bending force in the fibers and yarns that make up the sutures. An increase in the size of the suture significantly increased the stiffness, and the magnitude of increase depended on the chemical constituent of the suture. The flexural stiffness of sutures was also found to depend on the duration of bending in the test for stiffness. In general, monofilament sutures exhibited the largest time-dependent stiffness. This was most pronounced with the Gore-tex suture. Most braided sutures also showed less time-dependence in stiffness. Nylon sutures did not exhibit this time-dependent phenomenon regardless of physical form.\r"

Mammographic wire localization (MWL) is currently being used to facilitate the biopsy of these lesions. We reviewed 104 patients undergoing 106 biopsies after MWL during a 14 month period to determine the usefulness of MWL. The average age of the patients was 58 +/- 14 years, with a range of 38 to 83 years. Abnormal mammographic findings consisted of microcalcifications (48 per cent) or mass and density (43 per cent), or both (9 per cent). Lesions of the right side (55 per cent) and upper and outer quadrant (49 per cent) were predominant. An average of 1.4 (range of one to four) specimens taken at biopsy per patient were required to remove the lesion. The mean duration of the biopsy was 34 minutes, with a range of ten to 75 minutes, and the mean total time in the operating room was 63 (range 31 to 115) minutes. The average cost of the procedure did not differ significantly between local and general anesthesia ($1,030 versus $1,142, respectively). Pathologic findings included fibrocystic disease (77 per cent), carcinoma (12 per cent) and fibroadenoma (7 per cent). Normal mammary tissue was found in 4 per cent of the biopsies. Five of the 13 carcinomas were in situ and seven were either in situ (five) or microinvasive only (two); only six lesions were frankly invasive. Ten patients were treated with modified radical mastectomy while three had segmental resection. All patients had in situ or Stage I carcinoma. MWL effectively localized nonpalpable mammary lesions and allowed accurate diagnosis and treatment of early stage carcinoma of the breast.\r"

The histologic form of involvement of NAC included intraductal-1 in 19 patients, stromal in one patient, lymphatic in two patients and intraductal-1 as well as stromal in two. Stepcut and serial observation of the whole breast suggested that both intraductal spread and stromal invasion of carcinoma were continuous processes from the underlying tumor. Involvement of NAC was more frequent if the patient was aged 50 years or less and if the proximity of the tumor to the nipple was less than 4 centimeters, regardless of the size of the tumor.\r"

During a retrospective computer-aided chart review, 78 patients less than 20 years of age were identified who had the diagnosis of malignant melanoma. This accounted for 1.8 per cent of all the melanomas registered at the University Melanoma Clinic. Fifty-one per cent were females, and all the patients were white. Most of the lesions were found on the primary areas of the trunk and extremities. Sixty-seven per cent of the melanomas were of the superficial spreading type, and 82 per cent were invasive to Clark level III and IV. The range of tumor thickness was 0.32 to 5.22 millimeters, with a mean of 1.76 millimeters. Similar population characteristics were noted in the adult and juvenile populations. Controlling for the two most powerful prognostic factors for Stage I melanoma, that is, ulceration and tumor thickness, the actuarial survival times between the two population groups were similar. The median survival times in the adult and juvenile population were 12.9 and 11.9 years, respectively (p = 0.54). There was a trend toward a shorter disease-free interval in the juvenile population. The five year disease-free interval was 65 per cent for adults with melanoma compared with 57 per cent for juveniles with malignant melanoma (p = 0.16). Multiple regression analysis failed to reveal age less than 20 years to be an independent prognostic factor for the development of metastases or over-all survival time. Recurrent disease was observed in 46.2 per cent of juveniles with melanoma who were initially Stage I at diagnosis. Eighty per cent of the relapses occurred in either the local skin or regional lymph nodes. Although malignant melanoma is rare in populations of patients younger than 20 years of age, clinicians should be aware that melanoma does occur in juveniles. With an aggressive approach to surgical therapy, survival rate is comparable with that of the adult population.\r"

The journal Surgery Gynecology and Obstetrics requires both an abstract and a summary for its articles. We studied 83 reports from Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics, reviewing the similarities and differences in the abstracts and summaries based on six objective criteria: the number of words, the number of sentences, the number of repetitious sentences, the clarity of the abstract or summary without having to refer to the body of the article, the expression of conclusions and the introduction of new material that is not mentioned within the body of the article. Our results showed that, although abstracts were nearly one-third longer than the summaries, almost one-third of the sentences were repetitious. On the other hand, in one-fifth of the instances, the important conclusions of the article were included in either the abstract or summary but not both. We conclude that the quantitative and structural attributes of the summary and abstract are sufficiently similar to warrant that the abstract mandated by many publications has rendered the summary superfluous. Furthermore, when both the abstract and summary are included within an article, the omission of important conclusions can occur in one or the other. We recommend to retain the abstract or the summary in the conventional format in the articles rather than to have both in entirety or an altered format.\r"

Clinical examination, neuropsychological testing, and computed tomography scanning were repeated 3 months after ventriculoperitoneal shunting. All patients showed abnormal intracranial pressure waves and all improved after shunting. There was close correlation between number, peak, and pulse pressures of B waves and the mean intracranial pressure. However, quantification of B waves by means of number, frequency, and amplitude did not help in predicting the degree of clinical improvement postshunting. The most sensitive predictor of favorable response to shunting was enlargement of the temporal horns on computed tomography scan. Furthermore, the size of temporal horns correlated with mean intracranial pressure. There was no correlation between abnormalities on isotope cisternography and clinical improvement.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the duration of middle cerebral artery occlusion required to produce significant ischemic damage when the occlusion occurs during controlled systemic hypotension. In 21 anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys, an IV infusion of sodium nitroprusside was used to lower the mean arterial blood pressure to 45-50 mmHg for 90 minutes. Middle cerebral artery occlusion for 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes was performed during the hypotensive period. Neurological function was then evaluated every 8 hours for a total of 72 hours. At the end of the observation period, the monkeys were again anesthetized, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and the brain was perfused with 10% buffered formalin. Neurological deficits were observed after 30 minutes, but not after 15 minutes, of middle cerebral artery occlusion, and rapidly increased in incidence and severity when the duration of occlusion was increased. After 60 minutes of occlusion, all the monkeys exhibited severe deficits. Four monkeys died during the observation period--two in each of the 45- and 60-minute occlusion groups. Histopathological examination revealed that little or no ischemic damage resulted from a 15-minute occlusion during hypotension. However, severe ischemic damage began to occur after only 30 minutes of occlusion, and all monkeys subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 minutes developed extensive regions of infarction. The size and incidence of these infarctions correlated well with the lesions observed in the magnetic resonance images. These results demonstrate that the duration of middle cerebral artery occlusion that produces cerebral infarction in primates is drastically reduced when the occlusion occurs at hypotensive levels commonly employed during neurovascular surgical procedures.\r"

Laminectomy and total removal of the tumors were performed with temporary increased neurological deficits. It is thought that magnetic resonance imaging provides a useful diagnostic tool in these tumors and is also essential for planning surgical strategy.\r"

The use of the error calculus is exemplified by a study of the effect on the error margins in measurements of gray matter blood flow from flow level, relative weight of the gray matter compartment, and use of the earliest parts of the clearance curves. The clinical value of the error calculus is illustrated by its ability to separate different sources of measurement error. As a consequence, it is possible to optimize the method for blood flow calculation from the clearance curves, depending on the type of cerebral blood flow measurement. I show that if a true picture of the regional gray matter blood flow distribution is sought, the earliest part of the clearance curves should be used. This does, however, increase the error in the estimate of the average cerebral blood flow value.\r"

An abnormal hemispheric asymmetry of blood flow was seen, not only in patients with cortical infarcts, but also in those with subcortical infarcts. In the patients with subcortical infarcts, focal areas of reduced cortical blood flow were seen in the symptomatic hemisphere remote from the tissue destruction, usually including part of the noninfarcted frontoparietal cortex. The cortical dysfunction may have contributed to the clinical manifestations including aphasia, which was present in 14 of the 16 patients with subcortical lesions.\r"

The patients' neurologic grade on admission, hospital course, presence of vasospasm, level of consciousness, computed tomographic and angiographic findings, and outcome were compared with the concentrations of the above substances in the cerebrospinal fluid. All patients had elevated concentrations of serotonin, with the highest levels found early in the hospital course of the patients who developed vasospasm. Tryptophan content increased markedly in association with clinical and angiographic vasospasm. Concentrations of prostaglandin F2 alpha correlated highly with development of and fluctuations in clinical vasospasm, with angiographic findings, with neurologic grade on admission, and with outcome. Our results suggest that prostaglandin F2 alpha may be involved in delayed clinical vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

We then used this model to investigate a number of mechanisms for the interaction. Rabbits fed a diet supplemented with 2% cholesterol developed hypercholesterolemia over 4 weeks with no histologically detectable atherosclerosis. This absence of anatomic change was reflected in normal biophysical elastic responses to graded radial stretch and normal optimum tension for responses to exogenous K+ in the selected arteries. However, basilar arteries removed from cholesterol-fed rabbits showed abolished myogenic responses to radial stretch and decreased median effective doses for added norepinephrine. These potentiated constrictor responses to norepinephrine were significantly correlated with increased plasma cholesterol concentration. A mechanism related to the opening of membrane calcium channels may be responsible for the supersensitivity.\r"

We measured blood flow to the brain and eye using microspheres and cerebral microvascular pressure in the pial arteries of normal and atherosclerotic cynomolgus monkeys. Unilateral intracarotid infusion of 10-30 micrograms/min serotonin did not affect cerebral blood flow in normal or atherosclerotic monkeys; serotonin did not alter blood flow to the eye in normal monkeys but decreased flow to the retina and choroid in atherosclerotic monkeys by 39 +/- 11% and 44 +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM), respectively. Infusion of 30 ng/min U46619 did not alter cerebral blood flow but increased the pressure gradient from the aorta to the pial artery, which is an index of large-artery resistance, in atherosclerotic monkeys. U46619 had no effect on blood flow to the eye in normal monkeys but decreased blood flow to the retina and choroid by 71 +/- 14% and 53 +/- 13%, respectively, in atherosclerotic monkeys. Thus, atherosclerosis potentiates the constrictor responses of large cerebral arteries to thromboxane and the responses of blood vessels of the eye to thromboxane and serotonin.\r"

After bilateral carotid artery occlusion for 15 minutes and reperfusion of the gerbil brain for 15 minutes, we determined the brain tissue concentrations of leukotrienes C4 and D4 by radioimmunoassay; they had increased from a baseline concentration of less than 1 to a mean +/- SEM concentration of 12.8 +/- 3.9 pmol/g brain. We also studied the effect of a flavonoid 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor on leukotriene production in the reperfused gerbil brain. A water-soluble flavonoid (5-hexyloxy-3',4'-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone 4'-disodium phosphate) was administered intravenously at a dose of 200 mg/kg body wt; 15 minutes later, both carotid arteries were occluded. The enhanced production of leukotrienes C4 and D4 in the reperfused brain was reduced by approximately 80% (from a mean +/- SEM of 12.8 +/- 3.9 to 2.2 +/- 1.3 pmol/g brain) in the presence of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. The flavonoid did not affect the production of prostaglandin D2, the concentration of which also increased in the reperfused ischemic brain.\r"

The evolution of cerebral injury was assessed in vivo in 24 cats by a combination of proton magnetic resonance imaging and phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy for 5 hours following occlusion. Immediately thereafter, the volume of histochemically ischemic brain tissue was determined planimetrically in triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-stained serial coronal sections. Nicardipine was initially administered as an intravenous bolus injection of 10 mg/kg/hr 15 minutes before or 15 minutes after occlusion, followed by continuous infusion at 8 mg/kg/hr for the 5 hours of the experiment. Compared with untreated controls, cats that received nicardipine before or after occlusion showed a significant reduction in the extent of edema in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex, internal capsule, and basal ganglia. The results of phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies suggest that nicardipine may protect against cerebral ischemic damage by an action on cellular metabolic processes that preserve high-energy phosphates during the ischemic period.\r"

We examined the interaction of nimodipine pretreatment in a dose sufficient to prevent postischemic hypoperfusion and hyperventilation. We studied four groups of rats: normocarbia plus vehicle (Group 1, n = 5), hypocarbia plus vehicle (Group 2, n = 4), normocarbia plus nimodipine (Group 3, n = 7), and hypocarbia plus nimodipine (Group 4, n = 6). Groups 3 and 4 received 1 mg/kg i.p. nimodipine, and Groups 1 and 2 received an equivalent amount of vehicle. Ventilation was left unaltered in Groups 1 and 3 or increased to lower PaCO2 to 21-24 mm Hg in Groups 2 and 4. Determination of regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCGU) was carried out using the [3H]2-deoxyglucose method, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was determined by the indicator fractionation method using [14C]iodoantipyrine. The brain regions studied were the cerebral hemispheres, the diencephalon, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. Hyperventilation in Groups 2 and 4 from approximately 38 to 22 mm Hg reduced rCBF to 60% of normocarbic levels (p less than 0.05). The slope and intercept of this response were similar in vehicle- and nimodipine-pretreated rats. Nimodipine modestly decreased mean arterial blood pressure by 20% and increased plasma glucose concentration by 60% (p less than 0.05). Although nimodipine tended to increase rCBF and decrease regional cerebrovascular resistance (rCVR), this was significant only for hemispheric rCVR (p less than 0.05). There was a borderline effect for nimodipine to increase rCGU, especially during hypocarbia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
