  ".W": "Microorganisms have been implicated in causing cytoplasmic incompatibility in a variety of insect species, including mosquitoes, fruitflies, beetles and wasps. The effect is typically unidirectional: incompatible crosses produce no progeny or sterile males, whereas the reciprocal crosses produce normal progeny. The parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis is one of the few species in which the cytogenetic mechanism of incompatibility is known. In this species the paternal chromosome set forms a tangled mass in a fertilized egg and is eventually lost. Here we report that cytoplasmic microorganisms are associated with complete bidirectional incompatibility between N. vitripennis and a closely related sympatric species, N. giraulti. Microorganisms can be seen in the eggs of both species. Hybrid offspring are normally not produced in crosses between the two species, but do occur after elimination of the microorganisms by antibiotic treatment. A cytogenetic and genetic study shows that bidirectional interspecific incompatibility is due to improper condensation of the paternal chromosomes. Microorganism-mediated reproductive isolation is of interest because it could provide a rapid mode of speciation. The mechanism of incompatibility in Nasonia is also of interest as a potential tool for studying chromosome imprinting and chromosome condensation.\r"

Although CNS depression and analgesia are well documented effects of the cannabinoids, the mechanisms responsible for these and other cannabinoid-induced effects are not so far known. The hydrophobic nature of these substances has suggested that cannabinoids resemble anaesthetic agents in their action, that is, they nonspecifically disrupt cellular membranes. Recent evidence, however, has supported a mechanism involving a G protein-coupled receptor found in brain and neural cell lines, and which inhibits adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-dependent, stereoselective and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Also, the receptor is more responsive to psychoactive cannabinoids than to non-psychoactive cannabinoids. Here we report the cloning and expression of a complementary DNA that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor with all of these properties. Its messenger RNA is found in cell lines and regions of the brain that have cannabinoid receptors. These findings suggest that this protein is involved in cannabinoid-induced CNS effects (including alterations in mood and cognition) experienced by users of marijuana.\r"

  ".W": "It is thought that in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is controlled by the dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor in the transverse tubular membrane, where it serves as the voltage sensor. We have shown previously that injection of an expression plasmid carrying the skeletal muscle DHP receptor complementary DNA restores EC coupling and L-type calcium current that are missing in skeletal muscle myotubes from mutant mice with muscular dysgenesis. This restored coupling resembles normal skeletal muscle EC coupling, which does not require entry of extracellular Ca2+. By contrast, injection into dysgenic myotubes of an expression plasmid carrying the cardiac DHP receptor cDNA produces L-type calcium current and cardiac-type EC coupling, which does require entry of extracellular Ca2+. To identify the regions responsible for this important functional difference between the two structurally similar DHP receptors, we have expressed various chimaeric DHP receptor cDNAs in dysgenic myotubes. The results obtained indicate that the putative cytoplasmic region between repeats II and III of the skeletal muscle DHP receptor is an important determinant of skeletal-type EC coupling.\r"

Our results indicate that charge movement is deficient in dysgenic myotubes but is fully restored following injection of an expression plasmid carrying the rabbit skeletal muscle DHP receptor complementary DNA, strongly supporting the hypothesis that the DHP receptor is the voltage sensor for EC coupling in skeletal muscle. Additionally, our data obtained for normal and chimaeric DHP receptor constructs demonstrate that DHP receptors with widely differing abilities to function as calcium channels and to mediate EC coupling produce very similar charge movements.\r"

We have now examined whether a similar situation exists for human T cells bearing the gamma delta receptor. We found that reactivity to staphylococcal enterotoxin A is strictly dependent on the presence of the V gamma 9 variable region in the gamma delta T-cell receptor (TCR). These cytotoxic responses required the expression of HLA class II molecules by the target cell and could be inhibited by anti-gamma delta TCR and by anti-HLA-class-II monoclonal antibodies. In contrast to alpha beta TCR+ cell clones, no proliferative response of V gamma 9+ T-cell clones towards stimulator cells coated with enterotoxin A was observed in vitro. These results indicate that the gamma delta TCR repertoire might be influenced by enterotoxin A produced during staphylococcal infections in vivo. This could provide a molecular basis for the observation that V gamma 9+ T cells form the large majority of peripheral gamma delta TCR+ cells but only a small proportion of thymic gamma delta TCR+ cells.\r"

  ".U": "90332045\r", 
  ".W": "Segmentation of the Drosophila embryo depends on a hierarchy of interactions among the maternal and zygotic genes in the early embryo. The anterior region is organized maternally by the bicoid (bcd) gene product, which forms a concentration gradient in the anterior half of the embryo. The gap genes are also involved in establishing the body plan, with hunchback (hb) being expressed both maternally and zygotically. Zygotic expression of hb is directly activated by the bcd gene product, leading to a subdivision of the embryo into an anterior half expressing zygotically provided hb protein and a posterior half that does not. A similar effect on maternally provided hb protein is caused by the gene nanos, which represses the translation of maternally provided transcripts in the posterior half. This regulation of hb protein is a prerequisite for abdomen development, because the presence of hb protein in the posterior half represses posterior segmentation. This repression mechanism suggests that posterior segmentation might not directly depend on maternal positional cues, but be solely organized at the zygotic level. Here we report further evidence to support this hypothesis and show that the hb protein itself is crucially involved in organizing abdominal segmentation. Differential concentrations of hb protein determine the anterior and posterior borders of expression of the gap gene Kruppel (Kr) and the anterior border of the gap gene knirps (kni), thus defining three positional values. These regulatory pathways are controlled in a redundant way, in part by bcd and in part by the maternal hb gene product.\r"

  ".U": "90332047\r", 
  ".W": "The pit-1 gene is a member of a large family of genes that encode proteins which are involved in development and which contain a highly homologous region, referred to as the POU domain. Pit-1, a pituitary-specific transcription factor, can activate the transcription of the growth hormone and prolactin promoters. It is expressed in mature thyrotroph, somatotroph and lactotroph cell types of the anterior pituitary which arise sequentially during development; somatotrophs and lactotrophs, which secrete growth hormone and prolactin, respectively, are the last to arise. Intriguingly, during ontogeny, pit-1 transcripts are observed in the rat neural tube and neural plate (embryonic day 10-11) and disappear thereafter (day 13), only to reappear exclusively in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland (day 15) just before activation of prolactin and growth hormone. This biphasic pattern suggests a complex mechanism of initial activation of pit-1 gene expression. Transcription and transfection analyses in vitro using wild-type and mutated promoters indicate that Pit-1 can positively autoregulate the expression of the pit-1 promoter as a consequence of binding to two Pit-1-binding elements. Mutation of the 5' Pit-1-binding site abolished positive autoregulation, whereas mutation of the element located immediately 3' of the cap site markedly increased expression of the pit-1 promoter. These data are consistent with a positive, attenuated autoregulatory loop that seems to function in maintaining pit-1 gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The Arc repressor, which is involved in the switch between lysis and lysogeny of Salmonella bacteriophage P22, does not belong to any of the known classes of DNA-binding proteins. Mutagenesis studies show that the DNA-binding region is located in the 15 N-terminal amino-acid residues. We have now determined the three-dimensional structure of the Arc dimer from an extensive set of interproton-distance data obtained from 1H NMR spectroscopy. A priori, intra- and inter-monomer nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) cannot be distinguished for a symmetric dimer. But by using the homology with the Escherichia coli Met repressor we could interpret the NOEs unambiguously in an iterative structure refinement procedure. The final structure satisfies a large set of NOE constraints (1,352 for the dimer). It shows a strongly intertwined dimer, in which residues 8-14 of different monomers form an antiparallel beta-sheet. A model for the Arc repressor-operator complex can account for all available biochemical and genetic data. In this model two Arc dimers bind with their beta-sheet regions in successive major grooves on one side of the DNA helix, similar to the Met repressor interaction. Thus, Arc and Met repressors are members of the same family of proteins, which contain an antiparallel beta-sheet as the DNA-binding motif.\r"

They include aneurysms at the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA-VA), aneurysms on the distal artery (PICA) and aneurysms at the junction of the vertebral and basilar arteries (VA-BA). We have had the opportunity to treat 17 patients and study the radiological records of 9 additional patients in the past 8 years. The aneurysms ranged in size from 3 to 30 mm, with mean values of 10.6, 7.3, and 9 mm for PICA-VA lesions, distal PICA lesions, and VA-BA lesions, respectively. Three of the 4 VA-BA aneurysms were located at the midline, and the mean distance of the PICA-VA aneurysms from the midline was 7.6 to 9.4 mm; 2 aneurysms crossed the midline from their parent VA. The aneurysms were located slightly more often on the left side (left:right ratio, 1:2), were found more frequently in women (2.25:1), and occurred at a mean age of 50 years. Ten aneurysms at the origin of the PICA and 4 VA-BA aneurysms were treated via a lateral suboccipital craniectomy; 3 distal PICA aneurysms were exposed by a midline craniectomy. Surgery was carried out acutely in 5 patients. Tortuousness of the VA required contralateral approaches in 2 patients, an exploratory craniectomy in 1 patient, and an approach toward the dome of 1 patient with a VA-BA aneurysm. Morbidity was primarily due to cranial nerve dysfunction. There were no perioperative deaths. These aneurysms can easily be missed on initial radiographic examination; one appeared only on the second study, one was seen to grow over 16 days, and one was discovered at the level of C1 extracranially. Our radiographic and surgical approach to the treatment of these lesions is presented.\r"

Beyond these micro-allocation problems lie the macro-allocation difficulties at the levels of state and federal government, where concepts of equality and justice--as they relate to allocation of resources--are altered by political forces; aging populations; new, devastating diseases; availability of rapidly improving technical, diagnostic, and treatment modalities; and the attendant costs and related tax burdens on the populace.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of the 21-aminosteroid U74006F was investigated using different dosages in a restricted, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Forty cynomolgous monkeys were divided into five groups of eight. There were two groups given treatment with placebos, one being saline and the other the vehicle in which U74006F was delivered. There were three U74006F treatment dosage groups: 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg. Each monkey underwent baseline cerebral angiography followed by right-sided craniectomy and subarachnoid placement of a clot around the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Treatment was administered intravenously every 8 hours for 6 days. Seven days after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage, angiography was repeated, and the animals were killed. In both saline or vehicle placebo treatment groups, significant vasospasm (VSP) occurred on the clot side in the extradural internal carotid artery (C3), the intradural internal carotid artery, the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral artery (A1,) and the MCA (P less than 0.01). After U74006F treatment, significantly less VSP developed in the A1 on the clot side (0.3 mg/kg U74006F treatment group) and the MCA (all U74006F treatment groups, P less than 0.05). When the percentages of change from the baseline for the vessel diameters on the clot side were compared, VSP was attenuated in the A1 (P less than 0.05) and MCA (P less than 0.001) of all U74006F treatment groups as compared with the placebo treatment groups. Only 0.3 mg/kg of U74006F significantly prevented VSP in C3 (P less than 0.01). Although the 0.3 mg/kg dosage appeared to have the most favorable effect, no significant differences were observed among the three dosage groups. Electron microscopy of the MCA on the clot side in the animals treated with U74006F still showed luminal convolutions and morphological changes in the endothelial cells. These changes appeared less prominent in those MCAs with milder VSP. If these results in primates are applicable to humans, U74006F would be useful in reducing VSP after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

During the past 14 years, additional angiograms have been obtained for 38 of the 45 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage whose initial angiograms disclosed no aneurysm. Aneurysms were found in 8 patients; 7 on the anterior communicating artery and 1 at the junction of the internal carotid and posterior communicating arteries. CT scans were taken within 4 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage in 31 patients. Analysis of these scans showed that the second angiogram revealed 1) an aneurysm in 21% of the patients with a thin layer of subarachnoid blood and in 63% of those with a thick layer; 2) no aneurysm in the patients without subarachnoid blood; and 3) an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery in 70% of the patients who showed a considerable amount of blood in the basal frontal interhemispheric fissure. These results suggest that if CT scans show thin or thick subarachnoid blood, angiographic study should be repeated early in the course. If a considerable amount of blood is shown in the basal frontal interhemispheric fissure, it is highly probable that an aneurysm is hidden on the anterior communicating artery, even if the angiogram is negative for an aneurysm.\r"

Although previous investigations have demonstrated the presence of adrenergic neurons adjacent to human cerebral vessels, the nature of adrenergic receptors on human cerebral blood vessels remains poorly defined. The present study was performed to characterize adrenergic reception on membranes prepared from human pia, a rich source of small blood vessels, using radioligand binding techniques. Adrenergic membrane receptors were characterized using the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol for the beta subtypes and [3H]prazosin and [3H]yohimbine for the alpha subtypes. Displaceable binding was demonstrated with each agent. A small series of adrenergic agents competed for the [3H]dihydroalprenolol, [3H]yohimbine, and [3H]praz binding sites in a fashion suggesting the presence of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta 1-, and beta 2-receptors on the vessels within human pia.\r"

We review our results of 15 patients with unstable thoracolumbar fractures treated with CDI at an average of 24 months' follow-up. The results are promising and compare favorably with other forms of surgical and medical management. Postoperatively, there was a loss of 2 degrees in the angle of deformity and 0.9 mm of vertebral body displacement. Incomplete neurological injuries improved one or more Frankel grades in 75% of our patients. There were three complications (20%). CDI offers theoretical advantages over Harrington instrumentation and conservative (nonoperative) management. The use of CDI in the treatment of unstable thoracolumbar fractures is endorsed by these results.\r"

Serum prothrombin times were maintained at 1.25 times control for an average of 5.8 months per patient, for a total patient exposure to warfarin therapy of 132 patient-months (11 patient-years). Only 1 patient suffered a recurrent pulmonary embolism, and this occurred during an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding, when anticoagulant therapy had to be discontinued prematurely. All patients were followed with serial computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans, and no patient showed radiographic evidence of intratumoral hemorrhage either during or after warfarin therapy. One patient, who died from a large recurrent glioblastoma, was found at autopsy to have scattered foci of intratumoral hemorrhage. This series, together with a review of the available literature, suggests that oral anticoagulant therapy is both a safe and effective means of treating thromboembolic complications in patients with residual malignant glial tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of the DNA content of various solid tumors and hematological malignancies may provide useful prognostic information. To date, however, there has been a striking lack of correlation between DNA content in neoplasms of the central nervous system and clinical behavior. Simultaneous quantitation of DNA content and proliferation-associated nuclear antigen (p105) by flow cytometry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues representing three major groups of central nervous system neoplasms--1) 21 astrocytic tumors, 2) 13 pituitary tumors, and 3) 19 meningiomas--and the results were correlated with clinical behavior. All 4 well-differentiated gliomas were diploid, while 3 of 9 anaplastic astrocytomas and 1 of 8 glioblastomas had a demonstrable aneuploid peak. Three of 13 pituitary tumors had an identifiable aneuploid peak, while only 2 of 19 meningiomas had an aneuploid DNA content. Cell-cycle analysis of the malignant gliomas revealed a significantly higher proliferative index (PI, %S + G2M) compared with the well-differentiated astrocytomas (P less than 0.05). Within the subgroup of diploid anaplastic astrocytomas, however, extended patient survival appeared to be associated with a higher PI. For diploid pituitary adenomas, the PI was consistently lower in the 3 tumors that recurred than it was in the remaining 8 adenomas. Nuclear antigen quantitation of diploid tumors showed a wide range of p105 expression in G0G1 cells, suggesting that, within each tumor, the cells are heterogeneous with respect to proliferative activity. Aneuploid nuclei of glial tumors showed enhanced expression of p105 relative to diploid cells of the same specimen. In pituitary tumors, the median G2M/G0G1 fluorescence ratio for p105 was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) for the 3 diploid recurrent tumors than for those that did not recur. These data support the assumption that the aggressive clinical course of malignant glial neoplasms may be related to an abnormal DNA stemline and/or an alteration in cell proliferative activity. Cell cycle analysis and measurement of p105 by this technique may provide information useful from both a prognostic standpoint and in directing adjuvant therapy.\r"

Sections of frozen glioma tissues bound both MAbs strongly, whereas normal brain tissues showed weaker reactivities, and tissues derived from carcinomas of various histological types were completely unreactive. Furthermore, the MAbs did not bind to peripheral blood cells or bone marrow cells.

We show that MyoD binds cooperatively to two sites in the muscle-specific creatine kinase enhancer; this is dramatically reflected in dissociation-rate measurements. A deletion of the acidic N terminus (residues 3-56) results in a protein that binds normally to single sites but fails to bind cooperatively to two adjacent sites, suggesting a role of the N terminus in cooperative interactions. In transfection assays, a reporter gene flanked by a single MyoD binding site fails to be activated by cotransfected MyoD expression vectors. In contrast, a reporter with two or more MyoD binding sites is activated by wild-type MyoD but not by N-terminally deleted MyoD. A reporter gene with a single binding site, although not activated by MyoD, can nonetheless compete for expression with a reporter gene containing three sites. Thus, in vivo, a single site can bind MyoD, but occupancy of two or more sites is required for subsequent transcriptional activation.\r"

  ".U": "90332634\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the expression and transactivation function of the X gene in integrated hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA from chronic hepatitis tissues, a series of transfectants containing cloned integrated HBV DNAs was made and analyzed for X mRNA expression and trans-activation activity by using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Most of the integrated HBV DNAs expressed X mRNA and encoded a product with trans-activation activity in spite of the loss of the 3' end region of the X gene due to integration. From cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of X mRNA transcribed from native or integrated HBV DNA, the X protein was found to be translated from the X open reading frame without splicing. For integrated HBV DNA, transcription was extended to a cellular flanking DNA and an X gene-cell fusion transcript was terminated by using a cellular poly(A) signal. The amino acid sequence deduced from an X-cell fusion transcript indicated truncation of the carboxyl-terminal five amino acids, but the upstream region of seven amino acids conserved among hepadnaviruses was retained in the integrated HBV DNA, suggesting that this conserved region is essential for the transactivation function of the X protein. These findings support the following explanation for hepatocarcinogenesis by HBV DNA integration: the expression of a cellular oncogene(s) is transactivated at the time of chronic infection by the increasing amounts of the integrated HBV gene product(s), such as the X-cell fusion product.\r"

An optimal anti-GVHD effect was attained by coadministering T-cell-depleted (TCD) syngeneic marrow. We demonstrate here that the full graft-versus-leukemia effect of allogeneic T lymphocytes is obtained even when GVHD is markedly diminished by the coadministration of IL-2 and TCD syngeneic marrow. This methodology represents an approach to the treatment of leukemia in which the beneficial effects of allogeneic T cells can be exploited while their major deleterious effect, GVHD, is avoided. These results may thus have an impact on the clinical use of BMT for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.\r"

Using a combination of the polymerase chain reaction and conventional screening procedures, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding the human platelet/human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell 12-lipoxygenase. From the deduced primary structure, human platelet/HEL 12-lipoxygenase would encode a Mr 75,000 protein consisting of 663 amino acids. The cDNA encoding the full-length protein (pCDNA-121x) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was expressed in simian COS-M6 cells. Intact cells and lysed-cell supernatants were able to synthesize 12-H(P)ETE from arachidonic acid, whereas no 12-H(P)ETE synthesis was detected in mock-transfected cells. A single 2.4-kilobase mRNA was detected in erythroleukemia cells but not in several other tissues and cell lines evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Comparison of the human platelet/HEL 12-lipoxygenase sequence with that of porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase and human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase revealed 65% amino acid identity to both enzymes. By contrast, the leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase is 86% identical to human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase. Sequence data and previously demonstrated immunochemical and biochemical evidence support the existence of distinct 12-lipoxygenase isoforms. The availability of cDNA probes for human platelet/HEL cell 12-lipoxygenase should facilitate elucidation of the biological role of this pathway.\r"

The hybrid peptides were demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy to fold, forming the same disulfides and basic three-dimensional structure as native apamin, containing a beta-turn and an alpha-helix. These hybrids were active in complementing S protein, reactivating nuclease activity. In addition, the hybrid peptide was effective in inducing antibodies that cross-react with the RNase, without conjugation to a carrier protein. The stability of the folded structure of this peptide suggests that it should be possible to elicit antibodies that will react not only with a specific sequence, but also with a specific secondary structure. Hybrid sequence peptides also provide opportunities to study separately nucleation and propagation steps in formation of secondary structure. We show that in S peptide the alpha-helix does not end abruptly but rather terminates gradually over four or five residues. In general, these hybrid sequence peptides, which fold predictably because of disulfide bond formation, can provide opportunities for examining structure-function relationships for many biologically active sequences.\r"

Regardless of the metal and its precise pattern of ligation to the protein, there is a common qualitative feature to the binding site: the metal is ligated by a shell of hydrophilic atomic groups (containing oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atoms) and this hydrophilic shell is embedded within a larger shell of hydrophobic atomic groups (containing carbon atoms). That is, metals bind at centers of high hydrophobicity contrast. This qualitative observation can be described analytically by the hydrophobicity contrast function, C, evaluated from the structure. This function is large and positive for a sphere of hydrophilic atomic groups (characterized by atomic solvation parameters, delta sigma, having values less than 0) at the center of a larger sphere of hydrophobic atomic groups (characterized by delta sigma greater than 0). In the 23 metal-binding molecules we have examined, the maximum values of the contrast function lie near to observed metal binding sites. This suggests that the hydrophobicity contrast function may be useful for locating, characterizing, and designing metal binding sites in proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of clonal heterogeneity is central to understanding the evolutionary and population genetics of the roughly 50 species of vertebrates that lack effective genetic recombination. Simple-sequence DNA fingerprinting with oligonucleotide probes (CAC)5 and (GACA)4 is a sensitive and efficient means of detecting this heterogeneity in natural populations of two clonal fishes, Poecilia formosa, an apomictic unisexual, and Rivulus marmoratus, a selfing hermaphrodite. The fingerprints are clonally stable for at least three generations. The technique clearly differentiates allozymically identical laboratory lines of R. marmoratus that were previously distinguishable only by histocompatibility analysis. The technique also reveals apparent cases of shifts in clonal composition of a natural population of each species. Clonal variation in most natural populations is quite high. For example, a sample of 19 specimens of P. formosa from one station on the Rio Soto la Marina contained 16 clones (average clonal frequency = 0.07). This level of clonal diversity implies that mutation, subsequent to the founding of clonal lineages, is an important source of variation in these populations. It also suggests that chance (sampling error) has a previously unappreciated role in determining the clonal composition of populations even though some of the clones may be divergent in biologically significant features.\r"

In view of the potential immunogenicity of gp96-related molecules in human tumors, we have defined the 5'-regulatory and complete coding regions of a human gp96 transcript. The 5'-regulatory region contains an imperfect heat shock element apart from other regulatory sequences. The amino acid sequence of human gp96 is 96% homologous to its murine counterpart and genes for the two molecules show significant homology between untranslated regions. Comparison of gp96 sequences to other sequences in DNA and protein data bases indicates significant homology with the stress proteins 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (grp94) and 108-kDa heat shock protein (hsp108) and 99-kDa endoplasmic reticular protein (ERp99). These molecules are either identical or represent a family of closely related molecules. With regard to their role in tumor immunity, it needs to be determined whether gp96 molecules are tumor antigens per se or whether they serve as carriers of other immunogenic moieties.\r"

Transfection of the cDNA caused COS-7 cells to develop a TSH-sensitive adenylate cyclase response and the ability to bind 125I-labeled TSH; both activities were similar to those of rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells and not duplicated by lutropin. The gene represented by the cDNA was assigned to mouse chromosome 12 and human chromosome 14. Northern analyses identified two species of mRNA, 5.6 and 3.3 kilobases, in FRTL-5 thyroid cells; the transcripts appeared to differ only in the extent of their 3' noncoding sequences. There were minimal amounts of the two mRNAs in rat ovary, and neither was detected in RNA preparations from rat testis, liver, lung, brain, spleen, and FRT thyroid cells, which do not have a functional TSH receptor. TSH decreased both mRNA species 3- to 4-fold within 8 hr in FRTL-5 thyroid cells; down-regulation was dependent on TSH concentration and duplicated by forskolin, cholera toxin, or 8-bromo-cAMP but not by a phorbol ester. Down-regulation was also duplicated by thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies, which increased cAMP levels, but not by thyrotropin binding-inhibiting auto-antibodies, which actually increased TSH receptor mRNA levels.\r"

The tolerant anti-lysozyme B cells from double-transgenic mice were found to produce much less antibody than nontransgenic controls in T-cell-dependent antigen-specific responses, in adoptive transfer in vivo, and in hanging-drop cultures in vitro, as well as in response to stimulation with the nonspecific mitogen lipopolysaccharide. The diminished responsiveness of the tolerant B cells was not due to a reduction in the number of responding B-cell precursors per se nor were suppressor cells detected in titration, depletion, or mixing experiments. Nondeletional tolerance in this model, therefore, appears to result from an intrinsic functional change in the self-reactive B cells themselves.\r"

Basic FGF was expressed abundantly in 17 of 18 gliomas, 20 of 22 meninglomas, and 0 of 5 metastatic brain tumors. The level of mRNA expression of acidic FGF in gliomas was significant. In contrast, transforming growth factor type beta 1 was expressed in all the samples investigated. The mRNA for basic FGF and its peptide were localized in tumor cells in vivo by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, showing that basic FGF is actually produced in tumor cells. Our results suggest that tumor-derived basic FGF is involved in the progression of gliomas and meningiomas in vivo, whereas acidic FGF is expressed in a tumor origin-specific manner, suggesting that acidic FGF works in tandem with basic FGF in glioma tumorigenesis.\r"

The effect of vitamin D, required for optimal calcium absorption, was investigated. Twenty millimolar 44Ca was injected into the duodenal lumen in situ of vitamin D-deficient and vitamin D-replete chickens. At 2.5, 5.0, and 20.0 min after injection, duodenal tissue was obtained and processed for ion microscopic imaging. At 2.5 min. 44Ca was seen to be concentrated in the region subjacent to the microvillar membrane in tissue from both groups. At 5.0 and 20.0 min, a similar pattern of localization was evident in D-deficient tissues. In D-replete tissues, the distribution of 44Ca became more homogenous, indicating that vitamin D increased the rate of transfer of Ca2+ from the apical to the basolateral membrane, a function previously ascribed to the vitamin D-induced calcium-binding protein (28-kDa calbindin-D). Quantitative aspects of the calcium absorptive process were determined in parallel experiments with the radionuclide 47Ca. Complementary information on the localization of the naturally occurring isotopes of calcium (40Ca) and potassium (39K) is also described.\r"

In all cases, a major nucleosome position as well as a number of minor positions have been observed, which indicates that the generation of multiple positions is an inherent property of the 5S rRNA gene sequence. Interestingly, all positions observed differ by multiples of 10 base pairs. Data obtained under different reconstitution conditions demonstrate that the observed distributions of nucleosomes on these DNA templates are equilibrium distributions. This study has also examined the positioning of histone octamers from which histone \"tails\" had been removed by tryptic digestion. Results indicate that the histone tails are not determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although our results suggest that the mechanical properties of the 5S rDNA are the fundamental factors determining nucleosome positioning, they are insufficient to direct all nucleosomes into a single location.\r"

It is derived from band 3, a ubiquitous membrane transport protein found in diverse cell types and tissues. We have used synthetic peptides to identify aging antigenic sites on band 3, using a competitive inhibition assay and immunoblotting with IgG directed against the aging antigen on old cells. Results indicate that: (i) the active antigenic sites of the aging antigen reside on membrane protein band 3 residues that are extracellular regions implicated in anion transport (residues 538-554 and 788-827); (ii) a putative ankyrin-binding-region peptide is not involved in SCA activity; and (iii) carbohydrate moieties are not required for the antigenicity or recognition of SCA because synthetic peptides alone abolish binding of senescent cell IgG to erythrocytes. One of the putative transport sites that contributes to the aging antigen is located toward the carboxyl terminus. A model of band 3 is presented. Localization of the active antigenic site on the band 3 molecule facilitates definition of the molecular changes occurring during aging that initiate molecular as well as cellular degeneration.\r"

Two lipid compositions were used: phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/phosphatidylserine (PS), 10:5:1 (mol/mol), a composition that allows liposomes to be readily taken up by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (liver and spleen), and phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/ganglioside GM1, 10:5:1 (mol/mol), a composition that allows liposomes to avoid or delay the RES uptake (the so-called stealth liposomes). Although an increase in the number of antibody molecules per liposome was accompanied by an increased level of lung binding of the immunoliposomes, differences due to the lipid composition were more profound. For example, stealth immunoliposomes containing an antibody/lipid ratio = 1:37 (wt/wt) accumulated in lung to a level of 60% of the injected dose, whereas PS-containing immunoliposomes with a higher antibody/lipid ratio (1:8) only accumulated 50% of the injected dose in the lung. Conjugation of antibody to the stealth liposome did not increase the rate of liposome uptake by liver; this rate was approximately 10-fold lower than that of the PS-containing liposomes without antibody. Stealth immunoliposomes with high antibody content also showed long retention in the lung. The t1/2 of lung residence for the stealth immunoliposomes with an antibody/lipid ratio = 1:11 (wt/wt) was approximately 24 hr. The fact that stealth immunoliposomes showed a longer retention time in the lung than the PS-containing immunoliposomes of similar antibody content suggests that macrophages may play a role in the removal of the bound immunoliposomes from the pulmonary endothelium. Alternatively, dissociated stealth immunoliposomes may reenter the circulation and rebind to the lung target, causing an apparent slow overall dissociation rate. These results can be understood on the basis of two competing kinetic processes: lung binding whose rate is directly proportional to the antibody content of the immunoliposomes and uptake by RES whose rate is significantly reduced in the case of the stealth liposomes. Even for a modest level of antibody content, the half-life for target binding of immunoliposomes was significantly shorter than the half-life of liver uptake of the liposomes, resulting in a favorable target binding. Significant immunoliposome binding to the lung is not due to the fact that tail vein-injected liposomes flow through the lung capillary bed before they encounter the liver, because portal vein-injected immunoliposomes showed the same rate and extent of target binding as the tail vein-injected ones.\r"

Variance in male mating success in promiscuous species is thus interpreted as a result of phenotypic differences among males which females perceive and to which they respond. Here we show that, if some females copy the behavior of other females in choosing mates, the variance in male mating success and therefore the opportunity for sexual selection is greatly increased. Copying behavior is most likely in non-resource-based harem and lek mating systems but may occur in polygynous, territorial systems as well. It can be shown that copying behavior by females is an adaptive alternative to random choice whenever there is a cost to mate choice. We develop a statistical means of estimating the degree of female copying in natural populations where it occurs.\r"

Segregation data were collected on a set of multigenerational families provided by the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain, and maps were constructed using recently developed multipoint analysis techniques. The map spans 115 centimorgans (cM) in males and 193 cM in females. Over much of the chromosome there is a significantly higher frequency of recombination in females than males. Near the alpha-globin locus on the distal part of the short arm, however, there is a significant excess of male recombination. Twenty-seven (59%) of the markers on the map have heterozygosities greater than or equal to 0.50. The largest interval between loci on the sex-average map is 14 cM and the average marker spacing is 3 cM. Using loci on this map, one could detect linkage to a dominant disease on chromosome 16 with as few as 10-15 phase-known meioses.\r"

These sequences represent RNA transcripts that vary in abundance in pre-B-cell lines from 0.001% to 0.05%. Five of these sequences were not related to any known genes. One was related to but distinct from known myosin regulatory light chain genes and another encoded a protein with lectin domains. Three represented previously identified genes encoding carbonic anhydrase type II, thymosin, and CD2; these genes were not previously known to be specifically expressed in early stages of B-cell development. Other isolated genes corresponded to pre-B-cell-specific or pre-B-cell/B cell-specific genes recently described by others. The isolated cDNA sequences may be divided into two general categories--those representing genes expressed only in the pre-B-cell stage of B-cell development and those expressed in both the pre-B-cell and B-cell stages. The in vivo expression patterns of the identified genes suggest that some function specifically in lymphocytes while others may have roles in additional lineages.\r"

Partial cDNA clones were synthesized in a three part strategy, taking advantage of the polymerase chain reaction technology with oligonucleotides based on directly determined amino acid sequences. Subsequently, the complete clone for gMDH was synthesized with a sense primer corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the N-terminal end of pre-gMDH and an antisense primer corresponding to the adenylylation site found in the mRNA. The amino acids for substrate and cofactor binding identified by x-ray crystallography for pig heart cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase are conserved in the 319-amino-acid-long mature plant enzyme. The pre-gMDH contains an N-terminal transit peptide of 37 residues. It has a net positive charge, lacks a long stretch of hydrophobic residues, and contains besides acidic amino acids a cluster of serine residues. This N-terminal extension is cleaved off upon association with or import into glyoxysomes. It contains a putative AHL topogenic signal for microbody import and has no sequence similarity to the 27-residue-long presequence of the watermelon mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase precursor.\r"

HMf binding to linear double-stranded DNA molecules of greater than 2 kilobase pairs also increases their electrophoretic mobilities through agarose gels. Visualization of this compaction process by electron microscopy has demonstrated the formation of quasispherical, macromolecular HMf-DNA complexes. HMf is a mixture of approximately equal amounts of two very similar polypeptides designated HMf-1 and HMf-2. Determination of the DNA sequence of the gene encoding HMf-2 (hmfB) has revealed that over 30% of the amino acid residues in HMf-2 are conserved in the consensus sequences derived for eucaryal histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.

Abalone spermatozoa possess an acrosomal protein called lysin that creates a hole in the egg vitelline envelope by a nonenzymatic mechanism. Lysins from two species of abalone, termed pink and red, which share the same habitat, exhibit species specificity in the dissolution of isolated egg envelopes. Cloning and sequencing the cDNAs for pink and red abalone lysins reveal transcript lengths of approximately 660 nucleotides. The open reading frames of 465 (pink) and 462 (red) nucleotides show a 13% difference. The 3' untranslated regions before the poly(A) tails are 170 (pink) and 165 (red) nucleotides long and differ from each other by about 7%. The protein sequences show nearly identical signal sequences of 18 amino acids for both lysins. The mature protein is 137 amino acids in the pink abalone and 136 in the red abalone; the two mature lysins differ in 29 of 137 amino acids (21%). The most variable region, which may account for lysin's species specificity, is at the NH2 terminus, where 11 of the 15 amino acids differ between the two species. Predictions of secondary structure indicate that both lysins contain four homologous amphiphilic alpha-helices.\r"

  ".W": "A genomic clone containing two linked human pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein (PS beta G) genes has been isolated and characterized. The two genes are arranged in the same 5'----3' orientation; the 3' region (including the A2 and B-C exons) of the upstream gene, PSGGA, is linked to the 5' region (including the 5'/L and L/N exons) of PSGGB, the downstream gene. Depending upon the domains compared, PSGGA and PSGGB share 92-98% nucleotide and 86-95% amino acid sequence identity with PSG93, the most abundant PS beta G transcript. The 3' exon (B-C) of PSGGA contains four alternative splice sites and three polyadenylylation sites, which account for the 3' heterogeneity previously reported in the PS beta G family. Each of the predicted PSGGA-encoded proteins would have a different carboxyl terminus. PSGGB corresponds to the previously identified cDNA PSG6, which encodes proteins containing a 34-amino acid leader peptide and a 108-amino acid N domain, which is one amino acid shorter than the majority of PS beta G N domains. Additionally, the PSGGB-encoded proteins contain the cell-surface recognition tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp, shared by several previously reported PS beta Gs as deduced from cDNA sequences. Northern blot hybridization performed with a PSGGB-specific oligonucleotide probe to the N domain revealed that PSGGB or a PSGGB-like gene encodes a major 1.7-kilobase mRNA in hydatidiform mole tissues and a major 2.0-kilobase mRNA in term placenta tissues. Moreover, the PSGGB-specific probe hybridized most strongly with mRNA from molar trophoblastic tissue, suggesting that the PSGGB-like species may be the gene preferentially expressed in gestational trophoblastic disease. Additionally, the sequence of a 2315-base-pair PS beta G cDNA (PSG95) that contains an N-A1-A2-B2-C domain arrangement is reported. The coding region of PSG95 is identical to the previously reported cDNA clones PSG1d and FL-NCA, but PSG95 contains an additional 518 and 523 base pairs in the 3' end as compared with PSG1d and FL-NCA, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "For the past 3 decades, functional characterizations of the hippocampus have emphasized its intrinsic trisynaptic circuitry, which consists of successive excitatory projections from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus, from granule cells of the dentate to the CA3/4 pyramidal cell region, and from CA3/4 to the CA1/2 pyramidal cell region. Despite unequivocal anatomical evidence for a monosynaptic projection from entorhinal to CA3 and CA1/2, few in vivo electrophysiological studies of the direct pathway have been reported. In the experiments presented here, we stimulated axons of entorhinal cortical neurons in vivo and recorded evoked single unit and population spike responses in the dentate, CA3, and CA1 of hippocampus, to determine if pyramidal cells are driven primarily via the monosynaptic or trisynaptic pathways. Our results show that neurons within the three subfields of the hippocampus discharge simultaneously in response to input from a given subpopulation of entorhinal cortical neurons and that the initial monosynaptic excitation of pyramidal cells then is followed by weaker excitatory volleys transmitted through the trisynaptic pathway. In addition, we found that responses of CA3 pyramidal cells often precede those of dentate granule cells and that excitation of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells can occur in the absence of granule cell excitation. In total, these results argue for a different conceptualization of the functional organization of the hippocampus with respect to the propagation of activity through its intrinsic pathways: input from the entorhinal cortex initiates a two-phase feedforward excitation of pyramidal cells, with the dentate gyrus providing feedforward excitation of CA3, and with both the dentate and CA3 providing feedforward excitation of CA1.\r"

Penicillin-resistant strains of viridans groups streptococci (e.g., S. sanguis and S. oralis) that produce altered PBPs have also been reported. The PBP2B genes of two penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of S. sanguis were identical in sequence to the mosaic class B PBP2B genes found in penicillin-resistant serotype 23 strains of S. pneumoniae. Emergence of penicillin resistance appears to have occurred by the horizontal transfer of an altered PBP2B gene from penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae into S. sanguis. The PBP2B genes of three penicillin-resistant S. oralis strains were similar to the mosaic class B PBP2B gene of penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae but possessed an additional block of diverged sequence.

  ".W": "To address the issue of whether regulatory feedback exists between the electrical activity of a neuron and ion-channel density, we investigated the effect of Na(+)-channel activators (scorpion alpha toxin, batrachotoxin, and veratridine) on the density of Na+ channels in fetal rat brain neurons in vitro. A partial but rapid (t1/2, 15 min) disappearance of surface Na+ channels was observed as measured by a decrease in the specific binding of [3H]saxitoxin and 125I-labeled scorpion beta toxin and a decrease in specific 22Na+ uptake. Moreover, the increase in the number of Na+ channels that normally occurs during neuronal maturation in vitro was inhibited by chronic channel activator treatment. The induced disappearance of Na+ channels was abolished by tetrodotoxin, was found to be dependent on the external Na+ concentration, and was prevented when either choline (a nonpermeant ion) or Li+ (a permeant ion) was substituted for Na+. Amphotericin B, a Na+ ionophore, and monensin were able to mimick the effect of Na(+)-channel activators, while a KCl depolarization failed to do this. This feedback regulation seems to be a neuronal property since Na(+)-channel density in cultured astrocytes was not affected by channel activator treatment or by amphotericin B. The present evidence suggests that an increase in intracellular Na+ concentration, whether elicited by Na(+)-channel activators or mediated by a Na+ ionophore, can induce a decrease in surface Na+ channels and therefore is involved in down-regulation of Na(+)-channel density in fetal rat brain neurons in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "90332692\r", 
  ".W": "In adrenal chromaffin cells, stimulation of Ca2+ influx leads to the secretion of neurotransmitters. The intracellular Ca2+ target involved in the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (PM) is still not known. We have reconstituted this fusion in vitro by using chromaffin granules (CGs) and target membrane vesicles and a Ca2(+)-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Vesicle fusion is measured by a fluorescence dequenching assay with octadecyl rhodamine B used as the marker. CGs fuse with PM vesicles only in the presence of active PLA2. The kinetics of this fusion process depend on the amount of target PM added. Once fusion competence of PM vesicles is achieved by exposure to PLA2 (primed PM vesicles), it is conserved after removal of the PLA2 even in Ca2(+)-free buffer. The kinetics of fusion between these primed PM vesicles and CGs depend on the amount of PM and on the temperature. Further incubation of the PLA2-treated PM vesicles at 30 degrees C in the absence of calcium results in an enhanced fusion competence. During this incubation, the amount of free arachidonic acid liberated by PLA2 decreases, suggesting that during a second process arachidonic acid may be processed to the terminal fusogen. The final steps of secretion can thus be subdivided into a Ca2(+)-dependent and -independent process: first, a Ca2(+)-dependent activation of PLA2 liberating fatty acids from phospholipids and second, a Ca2(+)-independent processing to the terminal fusogen and subsequent Ca2(+)-independent fusion of the CGs with the PM.\r"

  ".U": "90332694\r", 
  ".W": "We studied intracellular pH (pHi) regulation in the absence of HCO3- in single mesangial cells (MCs) with the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and -6)carboxyfluorescein. Our approach was to acid load the cells by an NH+4 prepulse and to monitor the subsequent pHi recovery. Previous work on MCs and other cells has shown that the recovery is prevented by adding ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA) or removing Na+ before the recovery begins, suggesting that at low pHi only Na-H exchange contributes to the recovery. This conclusion is often extrapolated to the entire pHi range. To test this, we interrupted the recovery with EIPA at various pHi values, finding that EIPA unmasked a background acidification that was negligible at pHi less than approximately 6.7 but increased steeply at higher pHi values. Correcting the total recovery rate for this EIPA-insensitive component, we found that the EIPA-sensitive (Na-H exchange) rate fell steeply with increasing pHi between 6.3 and 6.7 but was relatively pHi insensitive between 6.7 and 7.2. Thus, the recovery halts as pHi approaches approximately 7.2 not so much because Na-H exchange slows, but because acid loading accelerates. Applying the mitogen arginine vasopressin (AVP; 100 nM) caused a rapid pHi decrease of approximately 0.4, followed by a slower increase to a level approximately 0.15 higher than the initial pHi. Coincident with this biphasic change in pHi was a biphasic change in Na-H exchange kinetics. In the early phase (i.e., pHi recovery commencing approximately 8 min after AVP addition), AVP linearized the pHi dependence of the exchanger; its rate was unaffected by AVP at pHi less than approximately 6.7 but was progressively inhibited at higher pHi values. In the later phase (i.e., pHi recovery commencing approximately 14 min after AVP addition), AVP shifted this linear pHi dependence in the alkaline direction; the exchanger was stimulated at pHi less than 6.9 but was modestly inhibited at higher pHi values (i.e., in the physiological range). At all times, AVP greatly inhibited background acid loading. Thus, AVP raises steady-state pHi not because Na-H exchange is stimulated but because, although the exchanger is inhibited, acid loading is inhibited even more.\r"

To examine the structure/function basis for the potent antiviral activity of oTP-1, we have exploited the direct approach of synthetic peptide competition with oTP-1 for receptor, using N-terminal oTP-1-(1-37) and C-terminal oTP-1-(139-172) peptides. These peptides possess structures similar to those predicted for the intact molecule on the basis of circular dichroism. oTP-1-(1-37) at 1.5 mM specifically blocked oTP-1 antiviral activity without affecting the antiviral activity of natural ovine IFN-alpha, recombinant bovine IFN-alpha, and recombinant human IFN-alpha. At concentrations as low as 0.15 mM, oTP-1-(139-172) blocked the antiviral activity of oTP-1, as well as that of natural ovine IFN-alpha, recombinant bovine IFN-alpha, and recombinant human IFN-alpha, but not recombinant bovine interferon gamma. Further, binding of radiolabeled oTP-1 to endometrial membrane preparations could be effectively inhibited by polyclonal anti-C-terminal and anti-N-terminal antisera, with the anti-C-terminal antiserum being the more effective inhibitor. Consistent with peptide and antiserum functional data, oTP-1 and recombinant bovine IFN-alpha are predicted to possess similar C-terminal structure but different N-terminal structure by composite surface profile predictions. The findings suggest that the C-terminal regions of IFN-alpha s bind to a common site on the IFN-alpha receptor while the N-terminal region binds to a site unique for the particular IFN-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "The differentiation or maturation potential of human thymocyte precursors has been studied by using a population of CD3/TCR-, CD4-, CD8- (\"triple negative\") thymocytes isolated by negative selection (TCR, T-cell receptor). This cell population, however, also contained 30-50% previously undescribed cells expressing very low levels of CD3/TCR gamma delta (CD3/TCR gamma delta low; approximately 60% of which expressed the variable region gene V delta 1). Correspondingly, TCR gamma and TCR delta gene rearrangements (predominantly V delta 1/joining region J delta 1) and full-length TCR gamma and TCR delta transcripts (but only immature TCR beta and no TCR alpha mRNAs) were found. These cells mobilized Ca2+ in response to ligation of CD3 but not following ligation of TCR gamma delta. When cultured in the presence of interleukin 7 or interleukin 2, these thymocytes gave rise to 30-60% CD3/TCR gamma delta medium and high cells (60-70% expressing V delta 1) seen as discrete populations. Thus, the proportion and V delta phenotype of in vitro generated CD3/TCR gamma delta cells closely resembled those of CD3/TCR gamma delta low cells in freshly isolated \"thymocyte precursor\" preparations. Small numbers of TCR alpha beta + cells also appeared. It is thus uncertain whether maturation, differentiation, or both account for the appearance of mature CD3/TCR+ thymocytes, although the former appears most likely.\r"

In contrast, a reassortant (Wa-182) of influenza A/WSN, which we isolated, whose NS gene was replaced with the NS gene of A/Aichi, was readily converted to defective interfering form after only a single high-multiplicity infection. The defective interfering particles of Wa-182 were devoid of the PA gene (RNA segment 3) but possessed several species of subgenomic RNAs of the PA gene origin. Such aberrant replication of the PA gene was shown to be caused by an extragenic effect of the NS gene of Wa-182, because, when the NS gene of Wa-182 was singly transferred to the wild-type A/Ann Arbor/6/60 virus, the recipient showed exactly the same features. Analysis of nucleotide sequence demonstrated that the NS gene of Wa-182 contained three point mutations relative to the wild-type NS gene that resulted in two amino acid substitutions in the nonstructural protein NS2, suggesting that the mutation in NS2 protein affected the normal replication of the PA gene of Wa-182. The results also suggest that the NS2 protein plays an important role in the synthesis of intact genome RNAs.\r"

The power of this technique is demonstrated by the application of four-dimensional carbon-13--nitrogen-15 (13C-15N)--edited nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy to interleukin-1 beta, a protein of 153 residues. The NOEs between NH and aliphatic protons are first spread out into a third dimension by the 15N chemical shift of the amide 15N atom and subsequently into a fourth dimension by the 13C chemical shift of the directly bonded 13C atoms. By this means ambiguities in the assignment of NOEs between NH and aliphatic protons that are still present in the three-dimensional 15N-edited NOE spectrum due to extensive chemical shift overlap and degeneracy of aliphatic resonances are completely removed. Consequently, many more approximate interproton distance restraints can be obtained from the NOE data than was heretofore possible, thereby expanding the horizons of three-dimensional structure determination by NMR to larger proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils and monocytes, but not lymphocytes, adhered strongly to plastic surfaces coated with GMP140, a protein of endothelial cells and platelets. This adhesion of neutrophils was mediated by GMP140 and not by the CD18 integrin complex. By contrast, GMP140 in solution inhibited the CD18-dependent adhesion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-activated neutrophils to plastic surfaces and resting endothelium, but not of resting neutrophils to tumor necrosis factor-alpha-activated endothelium. Thus, the binding of a soluble form of an adhesion protein selectively inhibited another set of adhesive events. Soluble GMP140 may be important in maintaining the nonadhesiveness of neutrophils in the circulation and may serve to limit inflammatory reactions.\r"

  ".W": "A change in synaptic strength arising from the activation of two neuronal pathways at approximately the same time is a form of associative plasticity and may underlie classical or Pavlovian conditioning. A cellular analog of a classical conditioning protocol produces short-term associative plasticity at the connections between sensory and motor neurons in Aplysia. A similar training protocol produced long-term (24-hour) enhancement of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). EPSPs produced by sensory neurons in which activity was paired with a reinforcing stimulus were significantly larger than unpaired controls 24 hours after training. Thus, associative plasticity at the sensory to motor neuron connection can occur in a long-term form in addition to the short-term form. In this system, it should be possible to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term associative plasticity and classical conditioning.\r"

After light activation of BPD-MA, a neutral red dye uptake assay was carried out to determine virus inactivation. Various drug incubation times and light intensities were tested as well as red cell lysis and distribution of VSV in blood. At BPD-MA concentrations between 2 and 4 micrograms per mL in whole blood, up to 10(7) VSV were inactivated. Several photosensitizers were also tested with this model to determine their relative efficacy in viral inactivation.\r"

Of the 61 repeatably reactive samples, 2 were positive, 26 were negative, and 33 were interpreted as indeterminate on Western blot. HTLV-II sequences were detected by PCR in one of the Western blot-positive samples, as well as in one Western blot-indeterminate sample that showed reactivity to p24 only. HTLV-I sequences were detected in the second Western blot-positive sample. HTLV sequences were not detected in the remaining samples, which suggested that the majority of individuals with indeterminate results on Western blots that used one set of commercially available reagents are not infected with HTLV. It is demonstrated in this study that PCR can be used not only to resolve the infection status of individuals with indeterminate Western blots but also to distinguish between HTLV-I and HTLV-II.\r"

Of 110,780 consecutive crossmatches, 141 were positive after a negative antibody screening test; only 4 of these were due to alloantibodies of potential clinical significance, for a predictive value of a positive AGT crossmatch, after a negative antibody screen, of 2.8 percent (4/141). The frequency of potentially shortened RBC survival was 1 in 27,685 units crossmatched. During a similar period, 56,090 autocontrols were performed with the antibody screen. The autocontrol was positive on 902 samples in which the antibody screen was negative. Antibody identification performed in 684 cases generally yielded only cold or warm autoagglutinins. In 96 cases, some form of alloantibody was detected, but only 25 had potential clinical significance by our criteria. Eight of these alloantibodies had concurrently caused in vivo sensitization of RBCs and were classified as delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions. The predictive value of the autocontrol, calculated as the number of significant alloantibodies detected in autocontrol-positive, antibody-screen-negative samples, was 3.6 percent (25/684). Inspection of these cases revealed 11 in which shortened RBC survival might have resulted if the serologic abnormality had not been detected. Thus, the autocontrol had a slightly greater yield of clinically significant findings than the AGT crossmatch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results of 631 random-donor platelet transfusions administered to 66 thrombocytopenic patients with palpable splenomegaly were analyzed. Increasing splenomegaly had a significant effect on corrected count increments (CCIs), with the greatest deterioration occurring in patients whose spleens were palpable greater than 2.0 cm below the left costal margin. A similar trend was noted when the percentage of transfusions with satisfactory CCIs was compared, although it should be noted that 42 percent of the transfusions produced CCIs greater than 7500, and a large proportion produced clinically helpful absolute increments. Splenomegaly also had an effect on platelet survival: in patients with CCIs greater than 7500, the mean ratio of 24-hour CCIs to 1-hour CCIs was 0.29 to 0.47 in patients with various degrees of splenomegaly, as compared to an expected value of 0.6 to 0.7. Sixteen patients, most with spleens palpable less than 5.0 cm below the left costal margin, consistently had CCIs greater than 7500. A significant fraction of patients with splenomegaly can benefit from platelet transfusion, and thus splenomegaly should not preclude intensive therapeutic approaches.\r"

  ".W": "Most patients who need peripheral blood stem cell transplantation do not have peripheral venous access that would allow apheresis for stem cell collection. Subclavian apheresis catheters have an unacceptably high incidence of thrombosis-related access failure. A technique has been developed for translumbar placement of permanent, subcutaneously tunneled, silicone rubber apheresis catheters into the inferior vena cava, and 40 of these catheters have been placed in 36 patients for stem cell collection. Twenty-six catheters have been left in place for venous access during the transplantation procedure. These catheters had a very low rate (2.3%) of apheresis-related related complications. Access failure was attributed to thrombosis in 10 catheters (25%) and to mechanical complications in another 9 (22%), but access was regained in all but 4 of these cases. The catheters functioned well as venous access devices during transplantation, only rarely developing complications during that time. Venograms performed at the time of removal of 16 catheters showed no case of caval occlusion. A residual fibrin sheath was found around 14 catheters. There was no clinical or computed tomographic scan evidence of bleeding after placement or removal of the catheters. Percutaneously placed, translumbar inferior vena cava apheresis catheters provide a safe and effective route for the collection of peripheral blood stem cells for transplantation, and they can be left in place for venous access during transplantation.\r"

PHP was evaluated as a physiologic oxygen carrier. PHP was synthesized from a pyridoxalated hemoglobin (PLP-Hb) and an activated diester of polyoxyethylene (POE). The average numbers of molecules of PLP and POE conjugated to a Hb molecule were 3.3 and 6.2, respectively. The p50 of PHP was 20.4 torr, which was much higher than the 14.0 torr of stroma-free Hb. At a Hb concentration of 6 g per dL, PHP had a physiologic colloid osmotic pressure (29 torr) and a lower viscosity (2.6 cP at 37 degrees C) than whole blood (4.2 cP at 37 degrees C). At temperatures below 20 degrees C, the p50 of PHP was higher than that of the red cells. PHP, which had an average molecular weight of 90,000, consisted of 83 percent monomeric PLP-Hb-POE conjugate, 12 percent dimeric PLP-Hb-POE, and 4 percent trimeric PLP-Hb-POE. The consistency of the relative contents of the components was well controlled through seven lots, and each component had sufficient oxygen-carrying capacity. The dimeric and trimeric components contributed to the prolongation of the residence of PHP in the circulation. The results indicate that PHP has favorable properties as an oxygen-carrying blood substitute and perfusate.\r"

The HLA antigen frequencies of the Native Americans were compared with those of 12,881 white bone marrow donors and were found to differ markedly. To investigate the implications these differences in HLA antigen frequencies would have for the location of unrelated bone marrow donors, the HLA types of 12 Native American bone marrow transplant patients from our institution were used to search among 5389 HLA-A,B,DR-typed white donors in the National Marrow Donor Program file and the file of 261 HLA-A,B,DR-typed Native American donors. In the white donor file, at least two donors were found that matched at all HLA-A,B,DR antigen loci of one Native American patient (8%). Using the Native American donor file, which was less than one-twentieth the size of the white donor file, and HLA-A,B,DR-matched donor was also found for one (8%) of the patients. These results suggest that although donors for nonwhites can be identified in a file of HLA-typed white volunteers, the probability of finding a suitably matched donor for such individuals is enhanced if donors representing racial or ethnic minorities are included in unrelated donor registries.\r"

Also included as controls were 18 surgical patients who received no RBCs during surgery. None of the 78 patients studied had IgG2 to CMV before or after transfusion. The absence of a total IgG response to CMV after transfusion could not be attributed to preexisting deficiencies in one or more subclasses, because all 78 patients had similar levels of IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 to CMV before transfusion. Discriminant analysis was used for statistical evaluation of the combined CMV subclass responses in each patient and the individual subclass responses. Individual patients responded to CMV antigens with an increase in concentration in any of the three subclasses or any combination of the subclasses, excluding IgG2. IgG subclass analysis showed that 10 of 27 patients who did not respond with at least a fourfold total IgG titer rise had a significant increase in IgG subclass antibodies to CMV. Three of 33 patients with at least a fourfold total IgG titer rise lacked a subclass response. These results suggest that the measurement of IgG subclasses may be a sensitive indicator of immune response to CMV.\r"

Patients (n = 186) were studied who had received at least six blood transfusions during a period of at least 3 months. Some 6944 units of blood were transfused. One hundred forty patients had hematologic disorders. The patients' sera were investigated every 3 months with indirect antiglobulin tests and enzyme-treated RBCs. Twenty-two patients (11.8%) made 33 antibodies. Seven patients made more than one antibody. Eight of the 22 patients (36.4%) made their first antibody before or at the 10th transfusion. The risk of immunization increased with the number of transfusions. Influence of gender and age was not demonstrable. Nor was a relationship demonstrated between blood transfusion reactions and RBC antibody formation; no delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions occurred. Anti-E was demonstrated in 12 patients and anti-K in 15. When the gene frequencies were taken into account, it appeared that anti-E was made by 11.5 percent of E-negative patients, most of whom were immunized after an estimated three transfusions with E-positive blood. Anti-K was made by 8.7 percent of the K-negative patients, after an estimated 2.1 units of K-positive blood. It might be desirable to match red cell units for the E and K antigens in patients at relatively high risk. These are primarily patients who have already formed an antibody and are going to receive many transfusions and women of childbearing age who are to receive more than 4 units of blood.\r"

Advanced age was associated with a reduced likelihood of adequate screening; 21 percent of women aged 50-64 years and 39 percent of those aged 65 years and older had not had a Pap test in the past 3 years. Factors positively associated with screening included perceived susceptibility to cervical cancer and the belief in the efficacy of Pap tests and benefits of screening. Fear of finding cancer was a significant barrier to cervical screening in this population. Of those women who had not been screened adequately, 58 percent were interested in obtaining Pap tests in the primary care setting. The implications for promoting cervical cancer screening in primary care practices are discussed.\r"

The results show that, at least in the short term, there is a critical age for onset of intervention to achieve the most benefit for the developmentally disabled child.

  ".W": "Newborn circumcision is the most common surgical procedure in the United States. The technique for local anesthesia, dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB), was first described in 1978. Although multiple subsequent studies have reported that DPNB can relieve pain and stress during a newborn's circumcision without any additional morbidity, many practitioners do not employ this technique. A survey of randomly selected active members of the Oregon Academy of Family Physicians evaluated their perception and use of DPNB. One hundred members were contacted, and 96 responded. Only 36 percent of those physicians performing circumcision used DPNB in circumcisions. The most common reasons given for not employing DPNB were a lack of awareness of the technique (31 percent), believing that pain response in circumcision was not significant (29 percent), and concern about risks (27 percent). The median effectiveness rate reported by those using the block was 70 percent. The majority of respondents were interested in the results of the survey as well as in more information regarding the technique. We believe further educational efforts are indicated to increase awareness and use of DPNB in performing circumcisions in the newborn. Because there is significant variation in the effect achieved, some instruction in appropriate technique also is needed as part of this educational effort.\r"

Today, the average American has a 5 percent probability of developing colorectal cancer during a 70-year life span. The majority of cases occur in persons aged greater than 50 years; the incidence increases up to age 75 years, after which there is a decline. Etiology is unknown; however, environment, genetics, and carcinogens have been implicated. Genetic relations of skin tags, colon polyps, and colon cancer are a matter of ongoing research. If such relations could be established, it could provide clinicians with a possible additional marker for persons at increased risk of colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma. Two cases are presented with a brief review of the literature.\r"

The technology of membrane oxygenation has been used since 1977 in neonates with predictably fatal pulmonary failure due to respiratory distress syndrome, persistent fetal circulation or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, meconium aspiration syndrome, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in older children with other pulmonary disorders has been limited. We report two cases of hydrocarbon aspiration involving petroleum-based products, both successfully treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A 15-month-old male infant who aspirated baby oil (light mineral oil) is particularly unusual owing to the generally expected low risk of aspiration with a hydrocarbon of such viscosity (greater than 60 Saybolt Universal Seconds). The second patient is a 16-month-old male infant who aspirated furniture polish (mineral seal oil). In both children severe intractable hypoxemia developed despite intensive ventilatory support, and they became candidates for alternative therapy. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation provides a potentially life-saving option when a patient fails to respond to conventional therapy for hydrocarbon aspiration.\r"

Distribution of common fracture types among the four subgroups was similar. Of the uncertain group, 22 cases of abuse were identified during admission and 7 additional cases were found at a later date. The total number of femoral fractures secondary to abuse was 43 (31%) of 138. Children younger than 3 years presenting with a femoral fracture should evoke a high suspicion for abuse.\r"

The occurrence of pertussis 7 to 30 days following home exposure among 62 previously vaccinated children was compared with that among 62 unvaccinated children similarly exposed. Classic whooping cough was diagnosed in 43 unimmunized children, and 1 vaccinated child experienced a 5-week illness that was probably pertussis (efficacy, 98%; 95% confidence interval, 84% to 99%). A few children in each group incurred respiratory illnesses that may have represented mild, atypical pertussis; including these as probable pertussis, vaccine efficacy was 81% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 90%). It is concluded that prior immunization with this four-component pertussis vaccine combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids is highly efficacious in preventing pertussis.\r"

Triplicate measurements were obtained by the two methods 10 to 15 minutes apart in 381 seated fifth-grade children, ages 10 to 13 years. The width of the air bladder of the blood pressure cuff was selected to be 40% to 50% of the circumference of the upper arm. The mean systolic and diastolic pressures (at the fourth phase of Korotkoff sounds) by the auscultatory method were 6.4 mm Hg lower and 8.7 mm Hg higher than the oscillometric systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that published normative levels of auscultatory blood pressure may be inappropriate as a standard when blood pressure measurement is obtained by the Dinamap Monitor. Until a new set of normative Dinamap blood pressure levels becomes available, one should use equations (A = 12.8 + 0.82D for systolic, and A = 34.3 + 0.54D for diastolic blood pressures at the fourth phase of Korotkoff sounds, where A is auscultatory blood pressure and D is Dinamap blood pressure) to predict auscultatory blood pressures before Dinamap blood pressures are compared with normative auscultatory blood pressure levels.\r"

To evaluate its efficacy and safety in premature infants, we administered deferoxamine by intravenous infusion to five premature baboons with hyaline membrane disease supported with conventional ventilation and 100% oxygen for 6 days. Seven animals served as controls. Deferoxamine treatment was initiated at 10 mg/kg per hour but, after the precipitous death of the first animal, was progressively reduced to 1.25 mg/kg per hour in the other animals. Four of five deferoxamine-treated baboons developed cardiovascular collapse and all five died by 42 hours. Five of the seven control animals survived the 6-day experimental period. Since cardiovascular toxic effects have not previously been reported, these findings suggest unique vulnerability of the immature cardiovascular system to iron chelation.\r"

The nasopharynges of 82 (96%) of 85 day-care center children, 26 (90%) of 29 day-care center staff, and 28 (90%) of 31 family members were cultured. Streptococcus pneumoniae grew from 29 (35%) of the 82 cultured day-care center children. Ten (34%) of the S pneumoniae isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, oxacillin, and tetracycline and were relatively resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.5 mg/L). All were serotype 14 and had the same antibiotic resistance pattern. Treatment of 97% of the day-care center children and staff with rifampin (10 mg/kg twice daily for 2 days) resulted in 70% reduction in positive nasopharyngeal cultures for S pneumoniae. No additional disease due to multiply resistant S pneumoniae was identified in the day-care center during a 9-month follow-up period. This report documents that an outbreak of multiply resistant invasive S pneumoniae occurred in a day-care center setting; that nasopharyngeal colonization of exposed children was common; and that rifampin treatment of 2 days only partially eradicated the organism from colonized individuals.\r"

The goal of this study was to determine the effects of bicycle-related injuries on the subsequent bicycle-riding behavior and safety practices of the child and other family members. Successful telephone contact was made with the parents of 82 of 230 children (age at time of injury, 4 to 15 years; median, 9 years; 57 boys and 25 girls) admitted to the hospital with bicycle-related injuries from 1983 to 1986. Parents were interviewed by telephone 4 months to 6 years after injury (median, 1 year 9 months). Head injuries predominated (64.6%). Almost all children continued to ride a bicycle after hospitalization (80 [97.6%] ). Few wore a bicycle helmet either before (6 [7.3%] ) or at the time of injury (3 [3.7%] ). More began wearing helmets after hospital discharge (20 [24.4%] ), but three fourths of the children still rode their bicycles without protective head wear. Helmet wearing also increased among bicycle-riding siblings after the index hospitalization (3 [7.0%] of 43 vs 7 [16.3%] ) but the difference was not significant. Parents commonly imposed restrictions on bicycle riding before hospitalization (78.0%) and after hospital discharge (82.9%). Twenty-six families (31.7%) reported more stringent rules after injury. Only 17 children (20.7%) participated in formal bicycle safety programs before the injury; only 5 (6.1%) more went through such a program after hospital discharge. Alone, an injury seems to have limited effect on the adoption of safe bicycling practices among children. The hospitalization of injured children provides opportunities for safety education to foster safe bicycling and to prevent injuries of all causes.\r"

This library demonstrates the power of microdissection for the identification of potential coding sequences near a disease locus and provides a promising resource for the identification of the fragile X mutation.\r"

  ".W": "The fragile X syndrome is a very common disorder, but there has been little progress toward isolating the fragile X mutation (FRAXA). We describe a panel of 14 somatic cell hybrid lines, lymphoblastoid cell lines, and peripheral lymphocytes with X-chromosome translocation or deletion breakpoints near FRAXA. The locations of the breakpoints were defined with 16 established probes between pX45d (DXS100) and St14-1 (DXS52). Seven of the cell lines had breakpoints between the probes RN1 (DXS369) and U6.2 (DXS304), which flank FRAXA at distances of 3-5 centimorgans. The panel of cell lines was used to localize 16 new DNA probes in this region. Six of the probes-VK16, VK18, VK23, VK24, VK37, and VK47--detected loci near FRAXA, and it was possible to order both the X-chromosome breakpoints and the probes in relation to FRAXA. The order of probes and loci near FRAXA is cen-RN1,VK24-VK47-VK23-VK16,FRAXA-++ +VK21A-VK18-IDS-VK37-U6.2-qter. The breakpoints near FRAXA are sufficiently close together that probes localized with this panel can be linked on a large-scale restriction map by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This panel of cell lines will be valuable in rapidly localizing other probes near FRAXA.\r"

After pedigrees are sampled, a specific power calculation can be carried out to evaluate the linkage information provided by the sampled pedigrees. Using computer simulation, I provide sample-size guidelines for linkage studies by the method of lod scores of quantitative traits partially determined by a dominant major locus. I consider the effects of a trait model, marker characteristics, and sampling strategy, with particular attention to sampling strategy because it is the one factor which the investigator can fully control. My results suggest that linkage studies of quantitative traits are practical, particularly if the investigator chooses an efficient sampling design and an efficient strategy to select pedigrees for linkage analysis.\r"

  ".W": "Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive degenerative disease of the nervous system of unknown biochemical cause. The FA gene has been shown to be in close linkage with the two chromosome 9 markers D9S5 and D9S15, and linkage disequilibrium between FA and D9S15 has been detected in French families by Hanauer et al. We used new highly informative markers at the above loci to analyze Italian FA families for linkage and linkage disequilibrium. The new markers were a three-allele BstXI RFLP at D9S5 (PIC = .55) and a six-allele microsatellite, typed by polymerase chain reaction, at D9S15 (PIC = .75). We obtained maximum lod scores of 8.25 between FA and D9S5, 10.55 between FA and D9S15, and 9.52 between D9S5 and D9S15, all at zero recombination. Our results, combined with those reported by other authors, reduce maxlod-1 (maximum lod score minus 1) confidence limits to less than 1.1 cM between FA and D9S5, 1.2 cM between FA and D9S15, and 1.4 cM between D9S5 and D9S15. Linkage disequilibrium with FA was found only for D9S15 when all families were evaluated but was also found for a D9S5/D9S15 haplotype in a subgroup of southern Italian families. We conclude that FA, D9S5, and D9S15 are tightly clustered and that studies of geographically restricted groups may reveal a limited number of mutations responsible for the disease in the Italian population. We present preliminary evidence from pulsed-field gel electrophoresis that D9S5 and D9S15 may be less than 450 kb apart. Linkage disequilibrium between FA and D9S15 suggests that the disease gene may be at an even shorter distance from this marker locus, which therefore represents a very good starting point for cloning attempts.\r"

  ".W": "Down syndrome (DS) is a major cause of mental retardation and heart disease. Although it is usually caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, a subset of the diagnostic features may be caused by the presence of only band 21q22. We now present evidence that significantly narrows the chromosomal region responsible for several of the phenotypic features of DS. We report a molecular and cytogenetic analysis of a three-generation family containing four individuals with clinical DS as manifested by the characteristic facial appearance, endocardial cushion defect, mental retardation, and probably dermatoglyphic changes. Autoradiograms of quantitative Southern blots of DNAs from two affected sisters, their carrier father, and a normal control were analyzed after hybridization with two to six unique DNA sequences regionally mapped on chromosome 21. These include cDNA probes for the genes for CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mapping in 21q22.1 and for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) mapping in 21q11.2-21.05, in addition to six probes for single-copy sequences: D21S46 in 21q11.2-21.05, D21S47 and SF57 in 21q22.1-22.3, and D21S39, D21S42, and D21S43 in 21q22.3. All sequences located in 21q22.3 were present in three copies in the affected individuals, whereas those located proximal to this region were present in only two copies. In the carrier father, all DNA sequences were present in only two copies. Cytogenetic analysis of affected individuals employing R and G banding of prometaphase preparations combined with in situ hybridization revealed a translocation of the region from very distal 21q22.1 to 21qter to chromosome 4q. Except for a possible phenotypic contribution from the deletion of chromosome band 4q35, these data provide a molecular definition of the minimal region of chromosome 21 which, when duplicated, generates the facial features, heart defect, a component of the mental retardation, and probably several of the dermatoglyphic changes of DS. This region may include parts of bands 21q22.2 and 21q22.3, but it must exclude the genes S0D1 and APP and most of band 21q22.1, specifically the region defined by S0D1, SF57 and D21S47.\r"

With the development of molecular genetic technologies such as RFLP, multilocus data are readily available to researchers. Several methods have been developed to analyze such data, and each performs well under restrictive conditions. The present paper proposes a method based on a multiplicative model and maximum-likelihood estimation of recombination fractions and interference coefficients. The estimators are consistent regardless of the model assumptions and are efficient if the model is a good approximation. The estimators are tractable even when there are incomplete observations. Furthermore, the interference between nonadjacent chromosomal regions or those among three chromosomal regions can be modeled and tested by a simple Z-test. The proposed method was applied to linkage analysis of four-locus data obtained from Drosophila and that of seven-locus data obtained again from Drosophila. Reanalysis of the first example revealed that there is interference between chromosomal regions 2 and 3. Analysis of the second example suggested that there is triple interference as well as pairwise interference between nonadjacent chromosomal regions; the genetic interpretation of these findings remains to be developed.\r"

The sample consists of the subset of identified families who also have at least one member with the common disease of interest. For each independent family in this subset, select one person with the disease and determine if he or she is heterozygous for the allele. The observed proportion of heterozygotes in this sample is compared to the proportion expected on the basis of each diseased relative's null probability of being heterozygous for the allele; this null probability depends only on the relative's relationship to the index individual and the population allele frequency. We provide these null probabilities, develop appropriate inference procedures, discuss sample size requirements, and compare this method to a standard case-control design. Results using this method are unlikely to be influenced by confounders, systematic bias, or genetic heterogeneity.\r"

The mutation was localized using the chemical cleavage method and further characterized by application of the polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. This 7-bp sequence is found in the normal gene as a direct tandem repeat. The deletion causes a change in the reading frame. Results have shown that the level of normal sized PDH E1 alpha in the fibroblast sample was approximately 30% of that of normal controls. This is consistent with normal transcription from the X chromosome carrying the nonmutated form of the E1 alpha subunit, as this chromosome is active in approximately 30% of this patient's cells. The severity of PDH E1 alpha deficiency in affected females is to a large extent dependent on the X-chromosome inactivation pattern in the brain. The clinical picture might therefore vary significantly between patients with the same mutation. We show that the 7-bp deletion must be a de novo mutation, because it is not present in the parent's X chromosomes. Furthermore, the deletion was not detected in chorionic villus samples in two subsequent pregnancies.\r"

The HLA antigen distribution corresponds on the whole to a mongoloid population with high frequency of the HLA-A9, -B15, and -B40 antigens (phenotype frequencies .533, .367, and .405, respectively). At the same time a strikingly high frequency for the \"Indo-European\" HLA-A1 antigen (phenotype frequency .282) was detected, which in Yakuts is found exclusively with HLA-B17 (haplotype frequency x 1,000 = 87.0; linkage disequilibrium value x 1,000 = 63.8). The present paper deals with a new hypothesis of the Yakut ethnogenesis according to which ancient Aryan tribes formed the substratum which was later assimilated by the mongoloid and Turkic populations. Another hypothesis that I have advanced argues that from analysis of the HLA system the ancient Aryans formed, a local group within the Indo-European entity, with high frequency for HLA-A1 and -B17 antigens and for the HLA-A1,B17 haplotype and with a complete absence of or very low frequency for the HLA-B8 antigen and for the HLA-A1,B8 haplotype. Significant linkage disequilibrium, as it is found in Indians and Yakuts, etc., could have resulted from mixing of the Aryans with non-Indo-European tribes. No significant linkage disequilibrium between A1 and B8 characteristic of the European caucasoids was produced in the mixing.\r"

Ninety-eight tyrosinemic children, including some of the 113 children born in the SLSJ region, have been screened by the Quebec Network of Genetic Medicine in the whole province since 1970. The geographical distribution of the 98 children screened showed the majority of them to have been born in the northeastern part of Quebec. The prevalence at birth was estimated at 1/1,846 live borns, and the carrier rate was estimated at 1/20 inhabitants in the SLSJ region. Three control groups matched to the tyrosinemic obligate-carrier couples were generated using the population register of the SLSJ region kept at SOREP. The mean coefficient of inbreeding was only slightly elevated in the tyrosinemic group compared with the control groups and was due to remote consanguinity. The mean kinship coefficient was 2.3 times higher in the tyrosinemic group than in the control groups. In the SLSJ region the places of origin of the tyrosinemic children and their parents did not show a clustered nonuniform distribution. Endogamy was not found to be higher in the tyrosinemic group than in the control groups. All these results support both the hypothesis of a founder effect for tyrosinemia and a high gene frequency in northeastern Quebec.\r"

FAH was purified from rat and human liver and was used to immunize rabbits. Specific antibodies were used to probe protein extracts of livers and other tissues of normal and tyrosinemic patients. No immunoreactive FAH band was observed on immunoblots of liver, kidneys, and lymphocytes from patients presenting with the acute form of hereditary tyrosinemia. Patients with the chronic form had immunoreactive FAH at a level approximately 20% of normal liver values, which was correlated with the measured enzymatic activity. Immunoblot analysis of aborted fetal tissues revealed normal FAH immunoreactivity in normal liver and kidneys. No FAH immunoreactivity was found in liver and kidneys of tyrosinemic fetuses. The presence of FAH immunoreactivity in normal fetal tissues suggests that deficient FAH activity in tyrosinemia is not simply related to a developmentally regulated expression of the enzyme. By this immunoblot assay, FAH was detected in most human tissues, with maximal immunoreactivity in liver and kidneys and with only trace amounts in chorionic villi and cultured amniocytes. These data confirm that the primary defect in the acute form of hereditary tyrosinemia is an absence of FAH. Moreover, these data suggest that both clinical forms of the disease have a different molecular basis.\r"

Succinylacetone determination on these same spots is used as the complementary test when the tyrosine level is higher than a given threshold. This procedure has proved to be less discriminant over the past few years because of changes in newborn feeding and because of early discharge of newborns from the nursery. We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the deficient enzyme in HT in dried-blood spots. Fumarylacetoacetase (FAH) (E.C.3.7.1.2) was measured retrospectively by an ELISA on 25 dried-blood samples from proven patients with HT and prospectively in 72,000 specimens received in the neonatal screening program. In this pilot project, FAH was measured first, and, if necessary, succinylacetone was determined as the complementary test. All 25 samples from proven patients and specimens from four other patients detected in the pilot study have shown almost complete absence of FAH in dried-blood samples. At a cutoff level of 12.5% of normal adult blood spotted on the same type of paper, only 30 other cases disclosed FAH levels low enough to warrant succinylacetone measurement but had no detectable succinylacetone. The false-positive rate is thus 1:2,400 with this primary ELISA. However, blood transfusion in newborns prior to blood collection on filter paper may yield false-negative tests, since FAH is present in erythrocytes of normal donors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean +/- SE fasting delta-amino-levulinate dehydratase (delta-ALD) was 40.05 +/- 1.79 m microM/min/g Hb in carriers, much lower than the 60.81 +/- 5.11 found in controls. After 3 h this difference in levels of delta-ALD remained, with mean +/- SE values of 25.70 +/- 2.89 m microM/min/g Hb in carriers, compared with 48.83 +/- 5.37 in controls. Three-hour mean +/- SE excretion of fumarylacetone \"equivalent\" [FAc] in urine in carriers, 51.597 +/- 5.580 micrograms/mg/creatinine, was significantly higher than the 27.941 +/- 5.916 in controls. Three-hour excretion of succinylacetone \"equivalent\" [SAc] was also significantly higher in the urine of carriers. FAc in 3-h urine was identified by thin-layer chromatography and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis showed that the inclusion order of significant variables was as follows: HGA levels at 1 hr, fasting level of delta-ALD, residual level of HGA at 3 h, and 3-h excretion of [FAc]. Non-significant variables were HGA tolerance, levels of delta-ALD at 3 h, sex, and 3-h excretion of [SAc].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When P. carinii is disseminated, the choroid may be involved and the infection is often fatal. We examined, treated, and followed up two patients who developed choroidal lesions typical of P. carinii while taking aerosolized pentamidine for prophylaxis. The choroidal lesions gradually resolved after three weeks of therapy with intravenous trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in one patient, and after three weeks of therapy with parenteral pentamidine in the other patient. The patients did not have clinical or laboratory evidence of P. carinii infection other than in the eye. It thus appears that early ophthalmologic examination may detect disease before it is threatening to sight and allow systemic therapy to be instituted before widely disseminated infection results in a fatal outcome.\r"

The dark-adapted electroretinogram showed no response to low-intensity stimuli that normally activate the rods, but large, slow responses to high-intensity stimuli. These large, slow waveforms persisted without change under light adaptation, and showed a striking mismatch to photopically balanced short and long wavelength stimuli (with sensitivity much greater to short than long wave-lengths). Since there is evidence from other studies that the electroretinogram and psychophysical responses represent hypersensitivity of short wavelength-sensitive (S or blue) cones, we propose that this disorder be called the enhanced S cone syndrome. There can be different degrees of severity in this syndrome, and progression appears to be slow.\r"

Behcet's disease, birdshot retinochoroidopathy, pars planitis, ocular sarcoid, sympathetic ophthalmia, and the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome were diagnosed in these patients. The response profile of both antigens paralleled each other. This profile was more commonly seen in patients suffering from diseases affecting the retina. Responders reacting to both antigens or to several fragments of an antigen were present. This pattern of response was seen in 26 of the patients tested. Patients with uveitis appeared able to recognize several autoantigens. This might be a consequence of the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier and may help perpetuate the inflammatory process. Several patients were capable of responding to more than one epitope of the same antigen, which indicates that there are major differences between the experimental model and human autoimmune diseases in the response to autoantigens. Both of these findings may to help develop new immunotherapeutic strategies in the treatment of uveitis.\r"

Peripheral corneal thinning required a large eccentric graft in each case. Follow-up ranged from one to eight years (mean, three years). One graft failed because of a persistent epithelial defect with keratolysis of the wound. Although endothelial allograft rejection was common, occurring in seven of 11 (64%) clear grafts, no graft failed because of rejection. Other complications included retinal detachment and a bacterial corneal ulcer. Suture erosion and vascularization of the graft were not problems. Postoperative spectacle correction was dispensed an average of 11 months after surgery. Visual acuity in seven patients without amblyopia, retinal disease, or a previous corneal ulcer at the time of spectacle correction ranged from 20/20 to 20/40 (mean, 20/30). Average final keratometric astigmatism in these patients was 2.46 diopters (range, 0.00 to 5.25 diopters). We believe that penetrating keratoplasty offers an excellent surgical result for patients with pellucid marginal corneal degeneration.\r"

Seven of the patients had strabismus. Five patients underwent strabismus surgery, had no tropia postoperatively, and the manifest latent nystagmus converted to latent nystagmus. Four of these five patients subsequently showed improvement in binocular visual acuity. Three patients received optical treatment; one had accommodative esotropia and, with appropriate spectacle correction, the manifest latent nystagmus was converted to latent nystagmus with improved vision. In the other two patients the manifest latent nystagmus lessened after correction with appropriate spectacles; binocular visual acuity of one of these patients improved. The possibility of converting manifest latent nystagmus to latent nystagmus by strabismus surgery is a reasonable surgical goal. In patients with manifest latent nystagmus and strabismus, surgical or optical alignment of the eyes decreases the nystagmus intensity and may also improve binocular visual acuity.\r"

For distant objects, pupils smaller than 2.5 mm produced image contrast of 70% to 95% because of the pinhole effect; larger pupils engaged the distance portion of the intraocular lens and maintain 80% contrast on average. Thus, the bifocal intraocular lens produced image contrast greater than 70% in all situations tested, except when imaging near objects with a pupil larger than 3.5 mm. The data suggest that image contrast is highly dependent on pupil size and object distance.\r"

Initial biometric data obtained on the patients included corneal diameter, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and ocular axial length. The average length of follow-up was five years. Of 54 patients with complete clinical records, 20 (37%) eventually required peripheral iridectomy after a mean duration of 16 months from the initial examination. Cox's survival analysis showed a strong correlation between shortened duration to peripheral iridectomy and increasing lens thickness/ocular axial length ratio factor (P = .03). No other variables were significantly related to outcome. This suggests that the lens thickness/ocular axial length ratio may be useful as a predictor of clinical outcome in narrow-angle glaucoma.\r"

  ".W": "High-drinking AA (Alko, Alcohol) and moderate-drinking Wistar rats, after ethanol drinking experience in their home cages, were housed continually in operant chambers with free access to water and food. Ethanol and water could be obtained by lever pressing on a concurrent FR1:FR1 schedule. The AA rats readily learned the operant response for oral ethanol, responded significantly more for ethanol than water, and increased ethanol responding when the fixed-ratio schedule for it was increased from FR1 to FR2 and FR4. This indicates that ethanol was serving as a reinforcer for the AAs. In contrast, the Wistars showed little evidence for ethanol reinforcement. Both AAs and Wistars had a three-peak pattern of ethanol responding during the dark phase, but peaks for the Wistars preceded those for the AAs by 1 or 2 hr. The patterns were similar when on an FR4 schedule, which greatly reduced the amount of alcohol, suggesting that they are not controlled by blood alcohol levels. The difference between the AA and Wistar patterns may, however, be related to the differential ethanol reinforcement.\r"

Stimulus materials were presented in two sensory modalities; the materials were photographs of faces expressing one of four emotions (happy, sad, angry, or neutral), and recordings of sentences with emotional intonations or semantic meanings expressing the same four emotions. Results of the experiments showed consistently severe deficits in emotional functions in the Korsakoff patients, but only minor alterations in the non-Korsakoff alcoholics. Older subjects, whether or not they had a history of alcoholism, also exhibited significant deficits on most of the tasks. Results of the study did not provide strong support for the premature aging hypothesis of alcoholism, which suggests that alcoholism accelerates aging, beginning either at the onset of heavy drinking early in adult life, or later in life after the normal manifestations of aging have begun to appear. Results are related to brain mechanisms in emotional perception and memory functions.\r"

  ".W": "The present investigation tested the hypothesis that multiple withdrawals from chronic ethanol treatment \"kindles\" seizure activity. Two animal models of kindled seizure activity--electrical stimulation of the inferior collicular cortex or the amygdala--were used to evaluate this hypothesis. Four withdrawals from a 12-day ethanol-liquid diet regimen facilitated the seizure kindling rate in the inferior collicular cortex, when the stimulation was initiated 7 days after the last withdrawal. In contrast, four withdrawals from this chronic ethanol regimen significantly attenuated the rate of amygdaloid kindling. When the withdrawals were increased to six or 10 using a 5-day chronic ethanol treatment schedule, the kindling rate in the inferior collicular cortex proved directly proportional to the withdrawal number. Continuous ethanol exposure over the same period as the 10 withdrawal group also facilitated the inferior collicular kindling rate, but not to the extent found in the 10 withdrawal group. A before, 10 withdrawals from the 5-day chronic ethanol liquid diet treatment attenuated the rate of amygdaloid kindling. Thus, this kindling action of repeated ethanol withdrawals appears specific to seizures originating from the inferior collicular cortex, not the limbic system. These findings support a previous hypothesis for a kindling etiology of alcoholism related seizures.\r"

In addition, the diet contained 20% oil; this was either of two mixtures, one comprised of predominantly n-6 (18:2n-6) fatty acids, and the other containing an equivalent amount of n-6, but supplemented with a source of long chain n-3 (20:5n-3, 22:6n-3) fatty acids. An additional control group was fed lab chow ad libitum. The treatment was implemented from day 7 to 17 of gestation, whereafter all groups were fed lab chow. Ethanol decreased maternal weight gain and pup body and brain weight; it also retarded both sensory and motor development in the pups and impeded reversal learning in a water maze. The n-3 supplementation lowered maternal blood alcohol concentration, but counteracted only some of the effects of ethanol, by increasing maternal weight gain and pup body weight, and also by enhancing sensory development in the pups. Such effects were additive, in that they were also present in the maltose-dextrin control group. These findings suggest that n-3 supplementation may ameliorate some of the effects of ethanol on neurobehavioral development, but the magnitude of the effect appears to be small.\r"

Hypothalamic CRF concentrations (outside median eminence) were significantly increased in animals with a high preference for ethanol whereas concentrations of CRF in neurointermediate pituitary and medulla-pons were significantly decreased. No changes of CRF levels were evident in median eminence, frontal cortex, midbrain, thalamus, or cerebellum. Brain CRF concentrations in two strains of mice with genetically determined differential alcohol preference were measured. In ethanol-naive mice, there were documented differences in CRF concentrations, with an increase in frontal cortex levels, and a decrease in medulla-pons levels in the ethanol-preferring strain (C57BL/6J) compared to the nonpreferring strain (C3H/CRGL/2). Thus, certain brain CRF neuronal systems are preferentially affected by high ethanol consumption, and pre-existing differences in these systems may even contribute to the development of a high preference for ethanol.\r"

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given 35% ethanol-calorie liquid diet, ad libitum, from gestation day 7 to 21. Control rats were pair-fed with isocaloric sucrose substituted for ethanol. Ethanol consumption decreased fetal body weight and increased placental weight. Twenty-four amino acids were determined in six tissues (maternal plasma and liver, placenta, fetal plasma, liver, and brain) by HPLC with orthophthalaldehyde derivatization. The effects of ethanol on free amino acid levels differed from tissue to tissue. In general, ethanol affected more amino acids in maternal plasma, fetal plasma, and liver. Maternal liver, placenta, and fetal brain amino acids were more resistant to ethanol effect. Two essential amino acids, histidine and tryptophan, were consistently decreased in fetal tissues by maternal ethanol consumption. The values (ethanol vs. control, nmole/ml or g, mean +/- SEM, N = 20) of fetal plasma, liver, and brain for histidine were 51.8 +/- 6.0 vs. 85.3 +/- 4.5 (p = 0.001), 269.0 +/- 26.4 vs. 503.7 +/- 47.3 (p = 0.0004), and 117.9 +/- 7.7 vs. 154.6 +/- 8.7 (p = 0.0055), respectively; and for tryptophan were 105.7 +/- 3.1 vs. 132.2 +/- 4.1 (p = 0.0001), 128.8 +/- 3.7 vs. 144.3 +/- 6.0 (p = 0.0407), and 83.4 +/- 7.2 vs. 103.6 +/- 3.2 (p = 0.0198), respectively.

Two methods were compared: (1) direct ELISA: samples, rabbit anti-hemocyanin-AA IgG, and beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum IgG added to a 96-well ELISA plate in a stepwise manner; and (2) two-site or sandwich ELISA: serum samples added to an ELISA plate that had been precoated with anti-hemocyanin-AA IgG (the capture antibody) and incubated stepwise with biotinated anti-hemocyanin-AA IgG (the signal antibody) and avidin-beta-gal conjugates. Serum protein-AA levels were then assayed by bound beta-gal activities at OD405. When human hemoglobin (Hgb)-AA was used as a model protein-AA for the sandwich ELISA, the EC50 (estimated concentration that corresponds to 50% of the OD405 response range) was 7 ng/ml. Direct ELISA was less sensitive (EC50 of 120 ng/ml). Adding control human serum to Hgb-AA increased the EC50 of the direct ELISA more than the sandwich ELISA. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variance for sandwich ELISA were both about 8%. Detection of Hgb-AA by sandwich ELISA was highly specific. The above results with anti-hemocyanin-AA IgG were also obtained when anti-myoglobin-AA IgG was used in sandwich ELISA. Using sandwich ELISA and anti-hemocyanin-AA IgG, OD405 for sera of control subjects and alcoholic patients were 0.036 +/- 0.033 (+/- SEM, n = 28) and 0.150 +/- 0.088 (n = 28), respectively.

The monkeys usually could move freely between an indoor shelter and a large outdoor corral, which contained three drinkometers. During daily 2-hr sessions in pre- and post-training periods (with food and water available ad libitum), the drinkometers held (on different days) Koolaid-saccharin, water, water with 5% ethanol, Koolaid-saccharin with 5% ethanol, or Koolaid-sucrose with acetic acid (matched in calories and palatability to Koolaid-saccharin with 5% ethanol). Between pre- and post-training periods was a long training period, in which Koolaid-saccharin with various ethanol concentrations was presented with the daily food ration in 2-hr drinking sessions. On other selected training days, water with 5% ethanol was presented. During training sessions some monkeys drank high doses; others did not. During the period of peak drinking, the daily mean ethanol consumption ranged among animals from 0.54-1.99 ml/kg. Blood ethanol concentrations then sometimes exceeded 100 mg/dl. During the post-training period, with return to ad libitum food and water, consumption declined from these peaks, but remained significantly higher than pretraining consumption; the ethanol solution was established as a reinforcer. Monkeys differed significantly in the extent of this pre/post increase. In both pre- and post-training periods, consumption was significantly greater when all three drinkometers operated, compared with only one. On pretraining days when only one drinkometer operated, more dominant animals drank significantly more than less dominant animals; this difference disappeared by the post-training period, as less dominant animals learned to use the drinkometers at times when the dominant animals eschewed the machines. Pretraining consumption did not predict (among animals) post-training consumption. Before, during, and after training, these animals drank less of both alcohol and control solutions than did members of another species, which we had studied in smaller indoor pens. We discuss possible explanations and implications.\r"

In animals, prenatal alcohol exposure alters anatomical, physiological, and neurochemical maturation and produces behavioral changes similar to those in children. Since thyroid hormones are critical trophic factors for normal somatic and neural maturation, and since fetal thyroid hormones are profoundly affected by acute maternal ethanol administration, we hypothesized that postnatal effects of prenatal alcohol exposure may be related to abnormal thyroid hormone development. We report here that young rats exposed to alcohol in utero have significantly lower serum total thyroxine (T4) concentrations than normal and pair-fed control rats. The results suggest prenatal ethanol exposure may compromise thyroid development in ways not attributable to undernutrition or developmental delays alone. Lowered total T4 levels may be a teratogenic outcome of prenatal alcohol exposure, which could contribute to impaired growth, altered neural organization, and behavioral dysfunction.\r"

To test this hypothesis, drinking practices of women and men were assessed at a large urban university at two points in time, 1977 (n = 1711) and 1985 (n = 1045). Although women's ethanol intake remained the same, significant changes in patterns of drinking were seen. The mean annual volume of beer consumed by females in 1985 showed a 33.9% increase over the mean annual volume in 1977. \"Binge\" drinking increased for both sexes from 1977 to 1985. A decrease in women's rate of abstention was also observed. Convergence with male drinking patterns was noted for several drinking parameters. This convergence was demonstrated by decreases in the ratios of men's drinking to women's drinking for these measures. Women consumed more wine per occasion than men in 1985. When corrections were made for differences in body fluid, the data suggested that convergence was not a trend, but had in fact occurred. The findings have serious implications, particularly in the light of recent findings that women are at greater health risk than men when they imbibe ethanol.\r"

Prolonged ethanol feeding progressively decreased CPT-I activity and increased enzyme sensitivity and sensitization to inhibition by malonyl-CoA in liver mitochondria. Similarly, long-term ethanol feeding progressively increased the sensitivity of CPT-I, as well as that of fatty acid oxidation, to inhibition by 4-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate. Short-term addition of ethanol or acetaldehyde to the incubations markedly increased the sensitivity of CPT-I to inhibition by malonyl-CoA in a subsequent assay in hepatocytes isolated from ethanol-treated rats, but not in cells from control animals. This effect may be mediated by the ethanol- or acetaldehyde-induced increase of intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. The present results show that ethanol feeding to rats leads to profound alterations in the regulatory properties of hepatic CPT-I, which seem to be determinant for the decreased capacity of fatty acid oxidation by the liver in this state. Nevertheless, all the above-mentioned alterations of the fatty acid oxidative system were reversible, disappearing after 2 to 4 days of ethanol withdrawal.\r"

  ".W": "A new theory is presented implicating oxidative cholesterol metabolism and oxysterols as possible factors in the development of alcoholic liver disease. Our present studies have revealed the accumulation of cholesta-3,5-dien-7-one, 13.05 +/- 2.75 micrograms/g (n = 8), and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one, 2.26 +/- 0.88 micrograms/g (n = 8) in fatty alcoholic liver, as compared with controls, 0.21 +/- 0.12 microgram/g (n = 7) and 0.3 +/- 0.33 microgram/g (n = 7), respectively. Acetaldehyde at 1 to 6 micromolar concentration in the blood and tissues of alcoholics cannot account for the extent of tissue damage, nor can it adequately explain liver steatosis characterized by accumulation of cholesterol and fatty acids and their esters in the liver of alcoholics known for their poor dietary habits. Oxysterols may be the primary cause for the development of alcoholic liver diseases and damage to accessory tissues. Significantly lower levels of 7-ketocholesterol in fatty liver, 6.8 +/- 3.5 micrograms/g (n = 8), as compared with control, 36.85 +/- 22.25 micrograms/g (n = 7), may be responsible for the increased cholesterol content of the alcoholic liver due to the inhibitory properties of this sterol on HMG-CoA reductase in cholesterol biosynthesis.\r"

The ratios of recalled repeated acute respiratory infections did not differ among the groups. Children in the control group were slightly more involved in physical activities. History of obstructive airway disease, findings on chest radiography, and distribution of immunoglobulin concentrations, including IgE, did not differ significantly. Lung function before and after exercise and after inhalation of salbutamol were not different. No impairment of small airways was detected.

Approximately a quarter were referred with minimal symptoms, only 12 (1%) with moderate to severe dehydration, and eight (less than 1%) with hypernatraemia. One hundred and ninety two of 1101 (17%) had not seen their general practitioner during the acute illness. One third had received no treatment and one third inappropriate antibiotics, antidiarrhoeals, antiemetics, or changes of milk. Gastroenteritis is a less severe illness than formerly but remains a significant cause of paediatric morbidity. Suboptimal treatment is common. Improved local district hospital and community based resources are needed.\r"

The dietary intake of fat and retinol was assessed from a seven day weighed food intake in 11 subjects with cystic fibrosis and 12 matched controls. Faecal excretion of retinol and fat were measured from three day stool collections. There was little difference between the two groups in the intake of fat or retinol equivalents. When studied the subjects with cystic fibrosis were clinically stable and the apparent absorption of fat was not significantly different to that in the controls. There was a significant increase in the faecal losses of retinol in cystic fibrosis, which was unrelated to the degree of fat in the stool. In cystic fibrosis the median retinol recovered in the stool was 40% of the intake, compared with 1.8% in the controls. It is concluded that there is a specific defect in the handling of retinol by the gastrointestinal tract in cystic fibrosis, which may be unrelated to the digestion and absorption of dietary fat.\r"

The remainder have dyskinetic or dystonic forms except for seven, who are unclassified. There has been no significant change in the prevalence of cerebral palsy among infants of normal birth weight (greater than 2500 g). Among low birthweight infants (less than or equal to 2500 g) there has been a significant increase in prevalence of all the main clinical types. This increase started later among the very low birthweight infants (less than or equal to 1500 g) than among those weighing 1501-2500 g. These changes in prevalence could be the result of either improved survival of prenatally impaired infants because of improvements in medical care, or a reflection of failure to maintain optimal conditions at or around the time of birth.\r"

Mortality rates for ages 1-5 months differed appreciably between countries, with Sweden lower than all other countries examined. Rates have decreased in Australia, Canada, and England and Wales, but increased in New Zealand and Sweden. Mortality reported as due to the sudden death syndrome (SIDS) increased dramatically in all countries, although much of the increase was probably due to diagnostic transfer from respiratory diseases. Over 80% of SIDS deaths occurred in the age group 1-5 months and SIDS accounted for about half of all deaths in this age group. For developed countries total mortality in those aged 1-5 months was an indirect measure of SIDS mortality. A real increase in SIDS has thus occurred in Sweden and New Zealand and possibly in other countries as well. Mortality in the age group 6-11 months has approximately halved in all countries examined over the study period.\r"

Seventy six Asian (37%) and nine European (12%) children had microcytic red cells (mean corpuscular volume less than 74 fl). Further investigation showed that 16 of the Asian children (21%) with microcytosis had thalassaemia trait (eight were heterozygous for alpha thalassaemia and eight for beta thalassaemia), and 50 (66%) had suspected iron deficiency (confirmed by a response to oral iron in 41 cases): the remaining 'microcytic' children were aged less than 2 years, when mean corpuscular volume between 70 and 74 fl may be normal. Increased values for serum total iron binding capacity were more sensitive in detecting iron deficiency than reduced serum ferritin concentrations. Enthusiastic screening for microcytic anaemia in young children may mean that a substantial minority with thalassaemia genes are given unnecessary iron supplements. The response to a short course of oral iron should therefore be carefully monitored, and the possibility of thalassaemia trait as well as non-compliance with treatment should be reconsidered in all those in whom there is little or no response.\r"

Overnight fluid deprivation tests (8pm-8am) demonstrated no significant difference in maximum urine osmolality or urine volumes, although the latter tended to be higher in the enuretic children. Maximum functional bladder capacity, estimated by maximum voided volume during oral fluid loading, was lower and the ratio of overnight urine volume to maximum functional bladder capacity higher in the enuretic than the non-enuretic group. Enuretic children were more likely than non-enuretics to be considered deep sleepers by their family. High urine volumes may contribute to nocturnal enuresis in SS disease, although the similar values in enuretic and non-enuretic children implies that additional factors determine the presence of enuresis. Low maximum functional bladder capacity, and a high ratio of overnight urine volume to maximum functional bladder capacity, appear to be important determinants.\r"

Of 21 children treated and reviewed at the referral centre, eight had abnormal chest radiographs, and 14 had abnormal V/Q lung scans. Three factors were assessed for prognostic importance: site of impaction, initial radiographic appearance, and time before removal. A child who had inhaled a foreign body into the left lung and who had collapse/consolidation on the initial chest radiograph was at greatest risk of long term complications. These children merit close follow up.\r"

The peripheral blood leukocytes obtained at low-stress baseline periods had significantly higher percentages of IL-2R-positive cells when compared with cells obtained from the same individuals during examinations. In addition, IL2-R messenger RNA in peripheral blood leukocytes decreased significantly during examination periods in a subset of 13 subjects. In one study, we found an increase in the accumulation of interleukin 2 in cultures of cells showing down regulation of IL-2R expression and IL-2R messenger RNA levels. While there are ample data demonstrating stress-associated decrements in the immune response in humans and animals, these data provide the first evidence that this interaction may be observed at the level of gene expression. The data suggest one mechanism whereby the central nervous system modulates the immune response during psychological stress.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the immediate and long-term effects on psychological distress and coping methods of a 6-week, structured, psychiatric group intervention for postsurgical patients with malignant melanoma. The intervention consisted of health education, enhancement of problem-solving skills, stress management (eg, relaxation techniques), and psychological support. In spite of good prognosis, most patients had high levels of psychological distress at baseline, comparable with other patients with cancer. However, at the end of brief psychiatric intervention, the experimental subjects (n = 38), while not without some distress, exhibited higher vigor and greater use of active-behavioral coping than the controls (n = 28). At 6 months' follow-up, the group differences were even more pronounced. The intervention-group patients then showed significantly lower depression, fatigue, confusion, and total mood disturbance as well as higher vigor. They were also using significantly more active-behavioral and active-cognitive coping than the controls. These results indicate that a short-term psychiatric group intervention for patients with malignant melanoma effectively reduces psychological distress and enhances longer-term effective coping.\r"

Along with a reduction in levels of psychological distress and greater use of active coping methods, the following immune changes were seen at the 6-month assessment point in the intervention-group patients (n = 35) compared with controls (n = 26): significant increases in the percent of large granular lymphocytes (defined as CD57 with Leu-7) and natural killer (NK) cells (defined as CD16 with Leu-11 and CD56 with NKH1) along with indications of increase in NK cytotoxic activity; and a small decrease in the percent of CD4 (helper/inducer) T cells. At the 6-week follow-up point, the majority of these changes were not yet observable. The results indicate that a short-term psychiatric group intervention in patients with malignant melanoma with a good prognosis was associated with longer-term changes in affective state, coping, and the NK lymphoid cell system. Affective rather than coping measures showed some significant correlations with immune cell changes.\r"

  ".W": "We examined psychiatric correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a major risk group for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, men with hemophilia. A central goal was to identify psychosocial factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychiatric distress after infection with HIV. Seventy-five hemophiliacs, 31 of whom were HIV seropositive (HIV+), were studied. The HIV+ men had elevated depression, anxiety, and anger-hostility symptom scores relative to those of men who were seronegative for HIV. There were no additional symptom differences among men according to infection stage or clinical severity of hemophilia. Men with any of eight psychosocial characteristics were particularly susceptible to effects of infection on mental health: a personal history of psychiatric distress before HIV diagnosis; familial psychiatric history; a high school education or less; low social support from one's wife; low family support; low friend support; a poor sense of mastery over one's life; and experiencing recent life events involving loss. The HIV+ men with one or more such characteristics were highly symptomatic; remaining HIV+ men had significantly lower symptom levels, similar to the low levels noted in the men seronegative for HIV. The findings provide initial empiric support for the notion that clinical services to alleviate emotional distress should be targeted to intervene on HIV+ persons' psychosocial assets and liabilities.\r"

Two thirds (n = 41) of those exceeding a preestablished cutoff met the criteria for DSM-III-R hypochondriasis when given a structured diagnostic interview, while the other third (n = 22) did not. The latter group showed significant decreases in their hypochondriasis questionnaire scores over a 3-week interval. They had less psychiatric disorder and more medical morbidity than the DSM-III-R hypochondriacs. They also viewed their medical care more positively, and their physicians considered them less hypochondriacal. The transiently hypochondriacal group was also compared with a random sample (n = 75) of the patients below the cutoff on the screening instrument. They had more Axis I disorder, more personality disorder, reported higher levels of somatosensory amplification, and more medical disorder. The differences in psychiatric comorbidity and amplification persist when medical morbidity is controlled for by matching and analysis of covariance. This is consistent with the hypotheses that among patients confronted with a medical illness, those with personality disorder and those who are sensitive to somatic sensation are more likely to develop transient hypochondriasis.\r"

By Clinical Global Impression Scale ratings, the 20-mg dose appeared to be superior to both the 5- and 10-mg doses for the first 2 weeks of treatment but not thereafter. On the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Schizophrenia factor, the 20-mg dose was superior to the 5-mg dose throughout the trial and tended to be marginally superior to the 10-mg dose after the first 2 weeks of treatment. By the second week of treatment, however, the group receiving the 20-mg dose deteriorated significantly with regard to Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ratings of Withdrawal-Retardation (blunted affect, motor retardation, and emotional withdrawal) as well as akinesia and akathisia ratings. Furthermore, 35% of patients given 20 mg/d of haloperidol insisted on leaving the hospital against medical advice vs only 4% of those given 5 or 10 mg/d of haloperidol. A 20-mg/d dose of haloperidol, therefore, may have substantial \"psychotoxic\" effects by the second week of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-three patients with acute exacerbations of Research Diagnostic Criteria schizophrenic, schizoaffective (mainly schizophrenic), and other nonaffective psychoses completed 24 or 28 days of treatment with randomized, fixed, double-blind doses of 10, 20, or 30 mg of oral fluphenazine hydrochloride daily. In the sample as a whole, improvement was not predicted by dose but was negatively related to duration of illness and of lifetime hospitalization, and to the presence of akathisia during the study (which was unrelated to chronicity). But among patients showing 40% or greater improvement in positive symptoms, percent improvement was predicted by dose and dose per kilogram of body weight; this was not the case for negative symptoms. Severity of acute extrapyramidal symptoms (excluding acute dystonia, dyskinesia, and akathisia) was significantly correlated with dosage per kilogram. Doses greater than 0.2 mg/kg per day were associated with greater clinical improvement but also with a high incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms; doses over 0.3 mg/kg per day were associated with more severe extrapyramidal symptoms. These preliminary results suggest that there is a linear relationship between fluphenazine dosage and acute outcome, and that this relationship is observed in patients whose conditions improve to a criterion level. It is suggested that the nonresponder group may include many patients in whom dose is not relevant because they are unable (for a variety of reasons) to respond to the study treatment conditions; excluding them from analysis may allow a significant dose-response relationship to be observed. Akathisia deserves further study as a possible predictor of nonresponse.\r"

End points were welded with laser light. Arteries were closed primarily. The laser endarterectomies were 6 to 60 cm long and required 168 J to 2447.5 J. All patients had symptomatic relief, with a postoperative ankle arm index of 0.97 +/- 0.10. There were no arterial perforations from laser radiation. Surgical complications included early thrombosis requiring thrombectomy (3 patients) and hematoma requiring evacuation (1 patient). The laser endarterectomies have an 88% patency at 1 year.

Fifty percent of the transfusion requirement was met by autotransfusion for the average patient. The per patient average volumes (liters) autotransfused were as follows: elective abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy, 0.87 L and nonelective, 1.45 L; elective aortobilateral femoral bypass, 0.63 L; elective thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysmectomy, 2.47 L, and nonelective, 2.15 L; and elective other, 0.53 L and nonelective, 1.30 L. Results of immediate postoperative and hospital discharge hemoglobin, hematocrit, and coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelets) did not differ from results of preoperative studies in any group.

In irradiated animals, survival was 100% in animals receiving glutamine compared with 45% in animals receiving glycine. Glutamine ingestion diminished bloody diarrhea and the incidence of bowel perforation. Arterial glutamine level was higher in animals receiving glutamine in the diet, as were gut glutamine extraction (35% +/- 8% vs 12% +/- 7%) and intestinal glutaminase activity. These metabolic improvements were associated with a marked increase in villous height, villous number, and the number of mitoses per crypt in rats receiving glutamine. Glutamine was not beneficial in control nonirradiated animals. The data demonstrated that provision of oral glutamine after abdominal radiation supported gut glutamine metabolism, improved mucosal morphometrics, and decreased the morbidity and mortality associated with this abdominal radiation model.\r"

  ".W": "Sclerosing cholangitis has been reported after surgical treatment of hydatid disease of the liver and has been hypothetically attributed to the caustic effect of the parasiticide solution injected into the cyst and diffusing into the biliary tree through a cystic-biliary fistula. In this experimental study, we showed that, in rats, injection into the biliary tract of 20% hypertonic saline solution or 2% formaldehyde solution, the most commonly used scolicidal solutions, was followed by lesions of the biliary epithelium. As compared with 20% hypertonic saline solution, the 2% formaldehyde solution caused more severe lesions of the biliary epithelium and, in addition, induced the development of sclerosis. This experimental study confirms the deleterious effect of scolicidal solutions to the biliary epithelium, shows that their effect is mainly related to the causticity of the scolicidal solution, and indicates that intracystic injection of 2% formaldehyde solution should be abandoned.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiovascular and endocrine responses were evaluated in 12 adult patients over a 5-day period following 30% to 66% burn injury. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and stroke volume were measured. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic peptide, vasopressin, neuropeptide Y, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were measured. On the day of burn injury, systemic vascular resistance was markedly elevated, and stroke volume and cardiac output were low, but all normalized by day 3, and cardiac output and stroke volume increased by day 5 without significant changes of central venous pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate did not change significantly over the 5-day period. Vasopressin, angiotensin II, neuropeptide Y, norepinephrine, and epinephrine concentrations in plasma were elevated on admission. Vasopressin concentrations were elevated 50 times normal on admission and returned to normal levels by days 4 to 5. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were normal on admission and increased significantly on days 3 to 5. The reciprocal relationship between systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output and between vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide correlate with each other and the observed physiologic events that occurred following burn injury and resuscitation. All of these changes in cardiac performance occurred without significant alterations in preload or afterload as measured by central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and mean arterial pressure. Increases in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide correlated with the increased stroke volume and cardiac output observed in these patients. The results of this study are consistent with the conclusion that the extreme elevations of plasma vasopressin levels contribute to the vascular complications of increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output and contractility seen following burn injury.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of 36 patients with duodenal villous tumors was reviewed to determine the long-term outcome of various surgical treatment options for specific adenoma histopathology. Duodenal villous tumors were typically solitary and periampullary in location. Villous adenomas contained epithelial atypia in 30% of patients, in situ carcinoma in 14%, and invasive carcinoma in 33%. Treatment consisted of transduodenal submucosal excision in 19 patients and radical pancreaticoduodenectomy in 15. There was no perioperative mortality. Perioperative morbidity for transduodenal excision and pancreaticoduodenectomy was 16% and 47%, respectively. Benign adenomas recurred more than 5 years postoperatively in 17% of patients undergoing transduodenal excision. Five-year survival following radical resection for invasive cancers was 45%. Overall median follow-up was 5.8 years. We conclude that duodenal villous tumors without invasive cancer can be managed successfully by local submucosal excision, but invasive carcinoma requires radical resection.\r"

DISIDA scanning had a false-positive rate of 18% in the normal volunteers. Gastric pH monitoring showed an increasing prevalence of duodenogastric reflux in patients with increasing clinical evidence of this condition, which was not seen with DISIDA scanning. Both DISIDA scanning and gastric pH monitoring identified duodenogastric reflux in most patients who had had previous pyloroplasty or antrectomy. Only gastric pH monitoring, however, showed a significantly increased prevalence of duodenogastric reflux in symptomatic patients after previous cholecystectomy compared with those who had not undergone previous surgery. These data suggest that 24-hour gastric pH monitoring is superior to DISIDA scanning in identifying duodenogastric reflux as a cause of foregut symptoms.\r"

In comparison with adults with pheochromocytomas, children have a higher incidence of bilaterality, familial association, and extra-adrenal location. Fourteen children with 22 tumors were treated during the period 1970 through 1988. Children presented at a mean age of 13 years. Most children (10 of 14) presented with sustained hypertension. The majority of tumors were located with a combination of computed tomography and iodine 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning. Eight adrenal and six extra-adrenal tumors were resected. Four children underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. Follow-up data are available on 9 of the 14 children. All of these patients remain normotensive without medication. Preoperative examination of children with pheochromocytoma using the iodine 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scan provides an accurate diagnosis of adrenal and extra-adrenal tumors, thus making feasible resection of this rare tumor with complete cure.\r"

  ".W": "During an 8-year period ending in 1988, 173 consecutive patients with a history of previous cerebrovascular accident underwent general anesthesia for surgery. Five patients (2.9%) had documented postoperative cerebrovascular accidents from 3 to 21 days (mean, 12.2 days) after surgery. The risk of postoperative cerebrovascular accident did not correlate with age, sex, history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents, poststroke transient ischemic attacks, American Society for Anesthesia physical status, aspirin use, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, intraoperative blood pressure, time since previous cerebrovascular accident, or cause of previous cerebrovascular accident. Postoperative stroke was more common in patients given preoperative heparin sodium. We conclude that the risk of perioperative stroke is low (2.9%) but not easily predicted and that the risk continues beyond the first week of convalescence. Unlike myocardial infarction, cerebral reinfarction risk does not seem to depend on time since previous infarct.\r"

The two techniques were compared with respect to the detection of technical defects, modification of the surgical procedures, early graft patency (72 hours), and complications. Completion arteriography was specific (95%) but only moderately sensitive (67%) compared with angioscopy for detection of technical problems. Following angioscopy, significant alterations in the surgical procedure were noted in 5 (10%) of the 49 cases. Early graft failure occurred in 3 (6.1%) cases but none were identifiably due to technical problems. Four patients suffered postoperative myocardial infarctions, 2 (4.2%) of which were fatal; no patients had contrast-induced allergies or renal failure. Angioscopy was measurably more accurate for the detection of technical problems than completion arteriography, but offered little information about distal arterial anatomy that may have an impact on graft patency or the use of antithrombotic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and there is reason to believe that it begins in childhood. Evidence is accumulating that early diagnosis and treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a major coronary risk factor, can markedly reduce the incidence of atherosclerotic heart disease in later life. A pediatric group practice consisting of six pediatricians and a pediatric nurse practitioner performed a cholesterol surveillance study of 6500 children between 3 and 18 years of age. Parents and patients were counseled regarding other coronary risk factors, and the American Heart Association diet was recommended. According to the results of the study, 1251 children (19%) exceeded the acceptable 90th percentile for cholesterol and that 143 of 299 significantly hypercholesterolemic children (48%) had no family history of premature myocardial infarction or known hypercholesterolemia. The current recommendation is that only those children from high-risk families should be screened for an elevated cholesterol level. The authors conclude, as a result of this study, that all children older than 3 years of age should have a cholesterol test and that advice regarding avoidance of high-risk coronary life-style behaviors should be a routine part of pediatric anticipatory guidance.\r"

Patients with inadequate venous collateral circulation may develop excessive pressure within the venous system, the vertebral bodies and overdistension of venous channels distal to the occluded zone. These changes may lead to hypoxemia, metabolic disturbances, irritation of unmyelinated nerves and result in night backache.\r"

Doses of glucocorticoid (15-25 mg/m2/day) and mineralocorticoid (0.15 mg/m2/day) replacement were determined initially using biochemical indices and thereafter adjusted according to surface area. Monitoring was solely directed at maintaining a 50th centile height velocity for chronological age. Of 41 patients, 32 were referred after the newborn period. Nearly half of these patients were either overtreated or undertreated before their referral. Of the nine treated from birth, all but one were in good control and only two have had a second hospital admission. Present height standard deviation scores (SDS) for chronological age range from -1.60 to -0.26. Height SDS for bone age were compared with midparental heights in 33 patients: 15 treated with early emphasis on growth had a height prognosis exceeding midparental values; patients who had experienced appreciable prior overtreatment or undertreatment fared less well. In the long term management of congenital adrenal hyperplasia correction of salt loss is of primary importance. Doses of glucocorticoid required in addition to mineralcorticoid replacement should be continuously assessed and adjusted to maintain a normal growth velocity. This is most conveniently achieved by standardising replacement doses on surface area.\r"

In 259 cases transfer occurred during labour; only 37 of these women were visited by their general practitioner. Many of the problems that precipitated transfer were predictable and some were considered preventable: 263 of the women transferred were considered unsuitable for booking by general practitioners. The perinatal mortality among women booked under their general practitioner was 10.1/1000 and the stillbirth rate 7.8/1000. These figures are high and suggest a need for tighter controls over the qualifications and experience of doctors participating in a fully integrated system of obstetric care.\r"

  ".W": "Influenza B viruses evolve more slowly than human influenza A, but no reasons for the difference have been established. We have analyzed sequence changes in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza B viruses (and have determined four hemagglutinin sequences, of B/Bonn/43, B/USSR/100/83, B/Victoria/3/85, and B/Memphis/6/86) in relation to antigenic properties and compared these with similar analyses of variation in influenza A antigens. Independent of the slower rate of change in influenza B antigens, only approximately 30% of nucleotide changes in either the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase gene sequence result in amino acid changes in the protein, whereas in influenza A 50% of nucleotide changes result in altered amino acids. Thus, there is less selection for change, or less tolerance to change, in the influenza B antigens. This is similar to findings with influenza C and findings with influenza A viruses that replicate in lower animals and birds and is closer to the type of variation found in other RNA viruses. We propose that human influenza A is unique in that it is the only virus group in which antibody selection dominates evolutionary change.\r"

SETTING: Metabolic and obesity clinics of two major teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: One hundred and three obese, lifelong nonsmokers without cardiopulmonary disease. CONTROLS: One hundred and ninety healthy, nonobese nonsmokers recruited from among hospital personnel. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Complete pulmonary function measurements in all patients and controls. These measurements included maximum expiratory flow-volume curve, lung volumes and airway resistance using body plethysmograph, single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, and total lung capacity using the helium dilution technique. Obese persons were found to have lower functional residual capacity, expiratory reserve volume, and total lung capacity by helium dilution than nonobese controls. In addition, residual volume and diffusing capacity were higher in the obese group. Finally, we found that obese men, but not women, had reduced maximum expiratory flow rates at 50% and 75% of exhaled vital capacity. CONCLUSION: Obesity may contribute independently of smoking habits to chronic airflow limitation in men.\r"

This technique was found to be very useful for the localization of the \"site of lesion.\" The procedure is safe, easy to master, and causes minimal inconvenience. It can reveal, in the most direct way, whether the disturbance is in the hypopharyngeal musculature (represented by the inferior constrictor muscle), in the cricopharyngeal muscle (spasm or lack of relaxation), or in the synchronization between them. Simultaneous recording of intraluminal pressure adds valuable information about the mechanical events associated with electromyographic activity. It was found that in pathologic cases there is quite often no correlation between the electrical and mechanical events. Thus, simultaneous recording of both electrical and mechanical events is essential for the understanding of the pathophysiology of disturbances of deglutition.\r"

The goal was to determine whether esophagography and esophagoscopy are necessary for the examination of patients before treatment. One hundred eighty-two patients were studied; both examinations were done in 148 patients. Twenty-one patients could not undergo esophagoscopy; esophagography was inadequate in 9 patients; 4 patients could have neither examination. Concordance was noted between the two procedures in 86.5% of patients. Sixty-five percent were normal, and 21.5% were abnormal. One esophageal cancer was found in this series that was diagnosed by both methods. Our data suggest that esophagoscopy and esophagography may be complementary in evaluating squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in patients before treatment. Esophagography alone was useful in patients in whom esophagoscopy could not be performed.\r"

Transfer of hair-bearing skin into the reconstructed upper digestive tract can be a major disadvantage associated with the pectoralis major flap. De-epithelialization of skin to the dermal level, removing the majority of skin appendages, can convert a myocutaneous flap to a \"myodermal\" flap. Platysma myocutaneous and myodermal flaps were grafted into the oral cavity of 13 dogs. Gross and histologic evaluation confirmed decreased hair growth in the experimental myodermal flap. Wound complications and graft survival were similar for both techniques. Diminished hair growth further supports the utility of myodermal flaps in hairy male patients undergoing upper digestive tract reconstruction.\r"

Two hundred eighteen patients without HIV infection served as a control group. A significantly higher percentage of nasopharyngeal lymphatic tissue hypertrophy was observed in HIV-infected patients compared with the control group, both clinically and pathologically. The finding of a higher incidence of nasopharyngeal lymphatic tissue hypertrophy during some stages of the disease, when cervical lymph nodes are enlarged, suggests that the extranodal nasopharyngeal district behaves in the same way as the lymph nodes. Nasopharyngeal lymphatic tissue hypertrophy should be placed at the forefront of the hitherto known head and neck manifestations of HIV infection. An ear, nose, and throat examination is mandatory for all patients with known or suspected HIV infection.\r"

This study uses the surface dissection microsphere method for regional cochlear blood flow analysis and morphometric techniques for quantifying capillary density in the stria vascularis. In this study 11 old and 10 young gerbils were used. Our results indicate that blood flow in the cochlea was decreased in the old gerbils. This decrease was most obvious in the lateral portion (stria vascularis). The decrease of blood flow in older animals was clearly not related to loss of strial capillaries with aging. The decreased flow to the lateral portion must arise from either decreased perfusion pressure or from increased vascular resistance. This decreased blood flow in the aged animals supports a vascular theory of presbycusis.\r"

We examined 20 jugulotympanic glomus tumors by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement and believe that these two imaging modalities, combined with clinical assessment, can provide all the necessary information regarding diagnosis, situation, and extent in the majority of jugulotympanic glomus tumors. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was particularly effective for the detection of small tumors confined to the middle ear and for confirmation that the jugular bulb was not involved. Consequently, angiography is no longer a first-line imaging investigation but rather a preoperative evaluation only in those tumors in which preoperative embolization is required or occasionally when the extent of the tumor, especially in the jugular bulb, cannot be confidently predicted by noninvasive imaging.\r"

  ".W": "Past research has indicated that binaural hearing abilities are not always normal in patients having otosclerosis who have received bilaterally normal pure-tone thresholds through stapedectomy. This study investigated whether poststapedectomy performance on the binaural masking-level difference test could be predicted from presurgery tests in which the two ears were stimulated at an equal sound pressure level and at an equal sensation level. Results indicated that (1) binaural hearing usually improved following stapedectomy, though some patients maintained abnormally poor binaural hearing even though postsurgery pure-tone thresholds were normal; and (2) prediction of postsurgery results was poor, with postsurgery results often being underestimated from presurgery results. Results are interpreted in terms of possible forms of auditory deprivation and acoustic crossover.\r"

A decision analysis was undertaken to determine the outcomes of these treatment options. The quality-adjusted life expectancies were determined using best estimates from the literature of survival, recurrence, short-term morbidity, and quality of life for radiotherapy and surgical resection. The quality-adjusted life expectancies were as follows: for surgical resection with neck dissection, 18.50 years; for surgical resection without neck dissection, 14.48 years; and for primary radiotherapy, 7.95 years. Sensitivity analysis showed that these results varied with quality of life assumptions and survival data. Therefore, each institution needs to review its own survival data and question patients about quality of life to determine how treatment options fit into the decision analysis.\r"

When using the argon laser, no disarticulation of the incus and stapes is required. Postoperative audiologic evaluation revealed normal hearing sensitivity bilaterally.\r"
