  ".W": "The calcium antagonists are effective and safe agents for the treatment of arterial hypertension. They are well tolerated by the patients. In contrast to other types of antihypertensive agents, they cause few metabolic disturbances. They can be combined with diuretics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. They can be safely prescribed to patients with hypertension and concomitant diseases such as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, gout, renal failure, peripheral atherosclerotic disease, or Raynaud's phenomenon. Dietary sodium restriction during antihypertensive therapy with calcium antagonists is not required for optimal antihypertensive efficacy. The second generation of calcium antagonists especially the dihydropyridine analogues that have greater potency and vascular selectivity, and a longer duration of action, will optimize the treatment of hypertension. Their antiatherosclerotic, antiplatelet, and \"antitrophic\" effects in experimental models for atherogenesis and hypertension hold great promise for the future since, so far, there has been no major success in reducing the incidence of coronary death by the treatment of hypertension.\r"

The cases of three patients with spontaneous esophageal perforation simulating other primary diagnoses are described. The respective referral diagnoses were pericarditis, lung abscess, and pancreatitis. Each case was characterized by severe illness, and by delay in diagnosis despite multiple consultations. Two patients died. The literature is reviewed and the causes of delay in diagnosis are analyzed. More than 40 years after the first report of successful surgical repair, spontaneous esophageal perforation is insufficiently considered in diagnostic hypotheses, yet may be confirmed or excluded by simple methods. All clinicians need to be alert to this lethal disease, and to be aware of its frequent atypical presentations.\r"

Additional retinoids are currently under development. Adverse reactions to these drugs include mucocutaneous irritation, hyperlipidemia, and profound teratogenicity. Appropriate patient selection is imperative before beginning therapy with these medications. An overview of retinoid metabolism and the currently available compounds is presented. The newest class of retinoids, the arotinoids, is also discussed.\r"

Participants were 164 women who underwent 194 oocyte recovery procedures at a university teaching hospital. Measurements of the intensity of pain and the quality of pain were obtained immediately after the procedure and again 1 hour later. Results show that the majority of patients reported manageable levels of discomfort, and that there was a marked reduction in both intensity and qualitative complexity over time, which suggests there were minimal residual effects. Repeated measures analyses of data from participants who underwent the procedure on two occasions suggest that familiarity with the procedure has no effect on reported pain. Finally, patients' levels of pain correlated significantly with several psychological self-report measures.\r"

Transverse and sagittal bladder diameters were measured with real-time ultrasonography in 50 women: (1) before uroflowmetry, (2) before supine-postvoiding catheterization, (3) before standing catheterization, and (4) after standing catheterization. Calculated bladder volumes, by use of the measured diameters, for each of eight formulas from the literature were compared with their corresponding measured total urine volume, total residual volume, and standing residual volume. The lower limit of ultrasonographic visualization of urine in the bladder was approximately 42 ml. No correlation existed between calculated ultrasound bladder volumes and measured urine volumes for any of the eight formulas. Standing residual volumes were measured in 96% of cases. Ultrasonography cannot as yet rapidly measure bladder volumes accurately. Catheterization remains the best method of assessing postvoid residuals: supine measurements, the gold standard, should be augmented by standing measurements when more accurate volumes are required.\r"

  ".W": "This report sought to determine whether estimates of fetal weight are enhanced by using ultrasonographic formulas targeted to the large-, appropriate-, and small-for-gestational-age fetus in both preterm and term pregnancies. Ultrasonographic fetal measurements from 575 singleton pregnancies were obtained within 7 days of delivery. The first 194 fetuses were classified into three groups on the basis of the growth percentile rank of the abdominal circumference (greater than or equal to 90%, greater than 5% and less than 90%, and less than or equal to 5%). Regression analyses were performed to generate three formulas for estimating fetal weight on the basis of the following: Gestational age (weeks) + Head circumference (cm) + 2 x Abdominal circumference (cm) + Femur length (cm). This mathematic model allowed formulation of accurate and concise tables relating the sum of these measurements to estimated birth weight. The accuracy of these formulas was then prospectively compared, first, with the formula published by Hadlock et al. (in 32 large-, 279 appropriate-, and 70 small-for-gestational-age fetuses) and second, with the formula of Weiner et al. (in 82 preterm fetuses). The difference between actual and estimated birth weights generated by the three study formulas had no systemic error (t test, p greater than 0.05). Cumulatively, there was a statistically significant reduction of random error in the birth weight estimates by use of the three study formulas versus the best single formulas of Hadlock et al. (2 SD reduced from 21.6% to 19.8% and absolute 2 SD reduced from 15.6% to 12.2%). Additionally, the three study formulas resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the absolute 2 SD error compared with the best formula by Weiner et al. in fetuses less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation (2 SD reduced from 19.1% to 13.6%).\r"

  ".U": "89225973\r", 
  ".W": "Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator produced by both maternal and fetal tissues that dilates the umbilical placental vasculature in vitro. To test the hypothesis that prostacyclin dilates the fetal placental circulation in vivo, we measured blood flow by the radioactive microsphere technique in six unanesthetized near-term ovine fetuses before and during prostacyclin infusion. Fetal mean arterial pressure fell 15% from 35 +/- 3 to 31 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) during prostacyclin infusion, and heart rate increased from 182 +/- 6 to 208 +/- 19 beats/min (p less than 0.05). Placental blood flow changed from 240 +/- 58 to 191 +/- 46 ml.min-1.kg-1 fetal weight (p = 0.07), whereas vascular resistance was unchanged (0.16 +/- 0.04 to 0.18 +/- 0.06 mm Hg.ml-1.min.kg fetal weight). Fetal arterial pH decreased from 7.33 +/- 0.03 to 7.28 +/- 0.02 (p less than 0.05) during prostacyclin infusion, with a significant decrease in base excess from -1.2 +/- 1.4 to -3.1 +/- 1.6 (p less than 0.05) and a trend toward hypercarbia (p = 0.07). We conclude that in vivo administration of prostacyclin to the ovine fetus does not cause fetal placental vasodilation and does cause a significant fetal acidemia. The mechanism for these unexpected observations is likely shunting of blood away from the placenta to other organs in the face of systemic vasodilation.\r"

Through primary and secondary review with preset inclusion criteria, two independent judges identified 27 randomized controlled trials, of which 13 met inclusion criteria. The quality of these randomized controlled trials was scored. Five randomized controlled trials regarding antenatal use of corticosteroids to prevent respiratory distress syndrome could be combined meta-analytically and showed a reduction in respiratory distress syndrome in the treatment group (p = 0.001). However, no significant reduction in respiratory distress syndrome (p = 0.286) was found after one study, with the lowest quality score, was excluded. A significant increase in endometritis and a trend toward an increase in neonatal infections and cesarean section rates were noted with treatment. Tocolysis, prophylactic antibiotics, and other interventions studied were not found to be of proved benefit and therefore should not be used outside of a randomized controlled trial.\r"

Analysis of antenatal factors with respect to survival showed that gestational age at delivery, the presence of hydrops, and the use of decompression amniocentesis may help in predicting outcome. These factors may be useful in deciding on the appropriate therapeutic approach for a particular pregnancy.\r"

Collagen type IV coated the cribriform plates as basement membranes and was also present within the cores as a fine filamentous network, which increased in density with age as the cribriform plates expanded. As this tissue ages, individual differences leading to more or less of a particular macromolecule of the extracellular matrix may alter the support function of the lamina cribrosa and influence the degeneration of the optic nerve associated with glaucoma.\r"

No abnormality in the distribution of T cell subsets (CD4+, CD8+) was detected. The proliferative response to the T cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin was normal. No increase in the number of T cells showing activation markers, such as human leukocyte antigens and interleukin-2 receptors, was noted. Conversely, function studies revealed a clear deficiency in interleukin-2 production by purified T cells. This lower production was probably intrinsic to the patients' T cells, since interleukin-2 production showed normal sensitivity to prostaglandin E2-mediated down-regulation by autologous monocytes.\r"

The prevalence of the FC27 S-antigen was found to vary between villages at a given point in time, as well as within a village over time. Residents of villages 2-5 km apart were infected with P. falciparum of different S-antigen serotypes. This study documents the periodic nature of transmission of a sub-population of P. falciparum defined by the FC27 S-antigen. The variation in a small area in the prevalence of this serotype of P. falciparum in Madang illustrates the complexities of malaria transmission which must be considered in the design of malaria vaccine trials.\r"

In the EE stage, it was synthesized toward the end of schizogony and appeared first to localize to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and then, as the cytomeres began to form, to the parasite plasmalemma. The EE and blood stage merozoites expressed similar amounts of this antigen as determined by indirect immunofluorescence.\r"

The absorption volume of the pyogenic group in the first month was also greater than that of the amebic group (3.0 +/- 5.0 ml/day vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8 ml/day, P less than 0.05). The resolution ratio of pyogenic and amebic liver abscesses in the first month was 74% +/- 38% and 36% +/- 23%, respectively. In 3 patients in the amebic group, the abscess was still detectable 2 years after treatment. These results suggest that pyogenic liver abscesses resolve more rapidly than amebic abscesses.

Since December 1982, 53 patients were referred from a university hospital to distant liver transplant centers for transplantation. Transplants were performed in 37 patients; at last follow-up, 6 died before transplantation, 7 were awaiting transplantation, and 3 were declined. Of the 53 patients referred for transplantation, 22 (42 percent) had a history of variceal hemorrhage. Sclerotherapy was required in nine patients and portosystemic shunt in four patients. Variceal hemorrhage contributed to the deaths of three of the six patients who died before transplantation could be performed. Endoscopic sclerotherapy has become the mainstay of invasive therapy in most patients with bleeding esophageal varices. If sclerotherapy is unsuccessful in the arrest or control of variceal hemorrhage, the decision must be made whether to proceed with urgent liver transplantation or portosystemic shunt. Factors which influence this choice include the ability to stabilize an acutely bleeding patient, the hepatic reserve and general clinical stature of a patient, and the availability of a liver transplant center.\r"

Thirty-two sheep with lung lymph fistula were given from 1 to 10 doses of 1 micrograms/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin, 12 h apart. Animals were killed 5 h after 1, 3, 5, or 9 doses of endotoxin or 3 to 5 days after the tenth dose of endotoxin. The lipid peroxidation process was monitored by circulating conjugated dienes and lung tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) content. We found that conjugated dienes and MDA were increased after one dose of endotoxin corresponding in time with the increased prostanoid production and increased permeability. Acute lung inflammation was also evident histologically. Lipid peroxidation was not increased, however, when 3 to 7 doses were given. The permeability change was also markedly attenuated whereas severe lung inflammation was still present on histologic examination. After 9 doses, we noted a fourfold increase in lung tissue MDA that corresponded histologically with a marked mononuclear cell infiltration. Physiologic changes included a sustained 50% increase in oxygen consumption. However, lung lymph flow was not increased, again, reflecting lung inflammation with no change in lung vascular permeability. The MDA remained increased 5 days after the last dose of endotoxin along with a marked lung mononuclear cell infiltration. The lung MDA content corresponded with the level of increase in VO2, but not with changes in pulmonary vascular permeability. Conjugated dienes were increased only after the first injection of endotoxin. The lung lipid peroxidation process does not appear to correspond to physiologic or histologic lung changes after recurrent exposures to endotoxin.\r"

  ".W": "Many studies have reported clearance rates of 99mTc-DTPA from the alveolar epithelial surface, but few have measured clearance of this solute from the bronchial mucosa. Those that have attempted such measurements have discounted the possibility that 99mTc-DTPA may be removed from the bronchial airways by mucocilliary transport as well as by absorption through the epithelium. This study was designed to better approximate the rate of 99mTc-DTPA absorption across the bronchial epithelium by correcting the measurements of total 99mTc-DTPA clearance for mucus transport. On two separate study days, each normal, nonsmoking subject (n = 8) breathed an aqueous aerosol (2.0 microns MMAD, sigma g = 2.0) containing 99mTc bound to DTPA or human serum ablumin (HSA) (a relatively nonpermeable solute that is cleared only by mucus transport over the period of measured clearance) while seated in front of a gamma camera. Breathing pattern was standardized to produce a similar central deposition of particles on both study days. From measurements of retention versus time over a 1-h period, exponential rate constants (Ktot and Km) were determined for the clearance of 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-HSA, respectively. By modeling the airways as a single compartment with two possible routes of clearance, we determined the permeability rate constant, Kp, as Ktot minus Km. Results showed that mucus clearance (Km) accounted for two thirds of the total rate of 99mTc-DTPA clearance (Ktot) (mean Ktot = 0.00985, Km = 0.00698, and Kp = 0.00287/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, they either failed to deliver the aerosol to the optimal site (bronchial mucosa, not alveoli) or failed to account for mucociliary clearance in analyzing their results. We studied 10 asthmatics and eight age-matched control subjects using a dosimeter (Spira-Elektra 2) and a carefully controlled breathing pattern to deliver aerosol to the subjects' airways. Two aerosols were delivered on separate days in each patient; 99mTc-DTPA aerosol, and 99mTc-HSA (human serum albumin), using similar breathing patterns to ensure reproducibility of the deposition pattern with the two aerosols. From measurements of retention versus time over a 1-h period, rate constants Ktot and Km were determined for the clearance of 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-HSA, respectively. By modelling the airways as a single compartment with two possible routes of clearance, we determined the permeability rate constant, Kp, as Ktot minus Km. There was no significant difference between Ktot in normal subjects and asthmatics; however, because of the slower mucociliary clearance in the asthmatic group, and the relative importance of mucociliary clearance in determining the washout of 99mTc-DTPA aerosol, there was a significant difference in airway permeability between the normal subjects and the asthmatics (t1/2 = 296 min +/- 141 SD and 126 min +/- 58, p less than 0.01, in normal subjects and asthmatics, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although reduced lung compliance is a hallmark of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the role of increased airflow resistance in this disorder has not been well studied. Because animal models of ARDS show marked increases in airflow resistance and because mediators known to participate in lung parenchymal injury have also been implicated in models of increased airway reactivity, we hypothesized that increased airflow resistance is a major contributor to altered lung mechanics in human ARDS. We studied 10 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS (criteria: PaO2 less than or equal to 70 mm Hg breathing FIO2 greater than or equal to 0.4; bilateral pulmonary roentgenographic infiltrates; Ppaw less than or equal to 18 mm Hg) measuring dynamic (Cdyn) and static (Cstat) compliance, airflow resistance across the lungs (RL), shunt fraction (QS/QT breathing FIO2 = 1.0), minute ventilation (VE), (a/A)PO2, dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT), airflow (pneumotachograph), transpulmonary pressure (intratracheal pressure minus esophageal pressure) and volume (integrated from flow) at 50 L/min peak flow rate. Airflow resistance was uniformly elevated and averaged six times normal (5.32 +/- 0.92 cm H2O/L/s versus 0.88 +/- 0.08) (p less than 0.05). Cdyn correlated directly with (a/A)PO2. RL correlated with peak pressure, but did not correlate with VE, shunt, (a/A)PO2, or VD/VT. We conclude that increased pulmonary airflow resistance contributes significantly to the altered lung mechanics in ARDS. These data are consistent with studies of animal models of ARDS and long-term survivors of ARDS and may be secondary to tissue factors, airway hyperreactivity, or airway inflammation.\r"

Five doses from 0.05 to 0.6 mg of ipratropium bromide as a nebulized solution, the standard dose of ipratropium bromide by metered-dose inhaler, 40 micrograms, and placebo were given in random order on separate days. End points were the maximal increase in FEV1 and FVC, and the area under the FEV1 and FVC curves in the 8 h after administration of each of the seven treatments. Forty-two patients completed all seven study days. By each of the above end points for FEV1, 0.4 and 0.6 mg of nebulized ipratropium bromide achieved significantly more bronchodilatation than did each of the other treatments. These two doses were not significantly different from each other, suggesting that the optimal dose in this patient population is 0.4 mg. After this dosage, the FEV1 increased by 440 +/- 194 (mean +/- 1 SD) ml at peak effect between 1 and 2 h, and significant bronchodilatation persisted for 6.5 h. Ipratropium bromide by metered-dose inhaler (40 micrograms) was equivalent to approximately 0.1 mg by nebulized solution and achieved only 63 to 73% of the bronchodilatation achieved by optimal doses of the nebulized solution. In terms of FVC, all treatments with ipratropium were significantly better than with placebo.

  ".W": "New evidence shows that systemic and intrarenal hemodynamic abnormalities are major factors in the initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Genetic predisposition to elevated systemic blood pressure may contribute to its development. Glomerular vasodilation and hyperfiltration, mediated in part by prostaglandins, may play a role in glomerular damage early in the course of diabetes, but clinical studies are limited. The development of more sensitive assays for albuminuria now allows early diagnosis of incipient nephropathy in the \"microalbuminuria\" phase. Treatment during this phase with antihypertensive agents, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or with dietary protein restriction, can decrease the degree of albuminuria, but data on their long-term effects on disease progression are limited. In hypertensive patients with established clinical diabetic nephropathy characterized by proteinuria in excess of 0.3 to 0.5 g/d, antihypertensive therapy has a major impact on delaying renal failure. Modalities that lower both systemic and intraglomerular pressure may be more beneficial in preserving renal function than those that primarily lower systemic pressure. Any therapeutic intervention should be monitored meticulously to establish its efficacy and safety in the individual patient. Therapy specifically directed against hemodynamic abnormalities throughout the course of diabetic renal disease may significantly delay and decrease the negative impact of this diabetic complication on survival and quality of life.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective study of the diagnostic accuracy of computer-aided consultation in 31 cases, as well as a prospective study of ward team diagnoses and opinions before and after consultation. SETTING: General medicine wards of two tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one patients identified as posing a diagnostic challenge and meeting eligibility criteria, as well as the housestaff caring for these patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 6 months follow-up, diagnoses were established in 20 of 31 cases. The diagnostic sensitivity of the computer-assisted diagnoses, 85% (95% CI, 56% to 97%), was similar to that of the consult service physicians, 80% (95% CI, 55% to 94%), but better than that of the ward teams, 60% (95% CI, 33% to 81%; P = 0.03 using the binomial test). The consultation influenced the postconsultation differential diagnoses of the ward teams in 26 of the 31 cases (95% CI, 92% to 95%). House officers rated the consultation service as being educationally helpful in 25 of the 31 cases (95% CI, 62% to 94%). CONCLUSIONS: Computer-aided diagnostic consultation, when provided by physicians familiar with the limitations of the system and capable of overriding inappropriate suggestions, was both accurate and educationally helpful in most cases. The system provided reasonable diagnostic suggestions not previously considered by the ward teams and these suggestions were valued sufficiently to cause alteration of the original differential diagnoses.\r"

Thus, all possible methods to control the spread of HIV infection in intravenous drug users should be explored. Key recommendations are that HIV antibody testing of intravenous drug users should be voluntary, because mandatory testing is counterproductive; free distribution of needles and syringes to intravenous drug users should occur only in carefully controlled circumstances to determine its effectiveness in decreasing infection rates; and drug-free and methadone maintenance treatment programs should be available on demand to all intravenous drug users as a means of reducing the spread of HIV infection. At present, the primary strategy for prevention must be education resulting in behavioral change. Education is currently the only definitive means for controlling the spread of HIV infection among intravenous drug users, their sex contacts, and to fetuses.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze the peripheral nerve pathological abnormalities in familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a correlative pathological study was carried out on the spinal nerve roots, proximal sciatic nerves, sural nerves, and brachial plexuses from 3 patients with the disease in Japan. The spinal nerve roots appeared to be unaffected except for amyloid deposition on the epineurium. In sciatic nerves and brachial plexuses the nerve lesions had a multifocal distribution, showing prominent interstitial edema in the endoneurium frequently adjacent to deposits of amyloid; in these regions the nerve fibers were severely depleted. A teased-fiber study revealed that segmental demyelination was the predominant type of nerve fiber abnormality. However, these findings were not seen in the sural nerves; instead a diffuse fiber loss with axonal degeneration was observed. It is suggested that multifocal lesions in the proximal portions of the long extremity nerves could summate distally to produce a symmetrical polyneuropathy in the disease. In addition to a space-occupying effect of amyloid deposits in the endoneurium, severe endoneurial edema associated with amyloid deposition in blood vessels and the endoneurial interstitium may induce ischemia in nerve fibers, thus causing the progressive polyneuropathy in this disorder.\r"

We cultured cells from the choroid plexus of 3 individuals who died of causes unrelated to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and demonstrated that these cells can be infected with type 1 HIV. Infection of cells of the choroid plexus may provide an initial route of entry of HIV into the cerebrospinal fluid and, together with the macrophage, a route of entry into the brain.\r"

  ".W": "Aeromonas salmonicida mutants selected for low-level resistance to small-molecular-mass antibiotics occur at frequencies that suggest point mutations and exhibit pleiotropic effects such as a multiple low-level antibiotic resistance, changes in outer membrane protein profiles, and loss of major exoprotease activity. Multiple low-level resistance appeared as the result of decreased outer membrane permeability associated with a change from a 38.5- to a 37-kilodalton (kDa) outer membrane protein. This decreased outer membrane permeability was determined by rates of nitrocefin hydrolysis by periplasmic beta-lactamase activity. The findings described above were supported by isolation of revertant strains selected for regained exoprotease activity, which also lost multiple low-level resistance and possessed outer membrane protein profiles indistinguishable from those of the original parent strains. Exoprotease from parent and revertant strains was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a major extracellular protein of approximately 69 kDa. No accumulation of a protein in this molecular mass range was observed in extracellular or periplasmic fractions from the mutants. The results suggested that exoprotease loss is not simply the result of an inability to export protease from the periplasm because of outer membrane protein changes, as has been reported for certain mutants of some other gram-negative bacteria. Also, several growth conditions were used, including some that have been reported to influence outer membrane protein expression and permeability in other enteric gram-negative bacteria. Although exoprotease expression in A. salmonicida was influenced by these conditions, no major outer membrane protein changes which would correspond to changes observed in the mutants were observed in parent strains.\r"

The molecular mass and pI of this enzyme were 28 kilodaltons and 7.4, respectively. Although the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca hydrolyzed many cephalosporins, including broad-spectrum drugs, the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence lacked homology with chromosomal class C beta-lactamase genes (ampC) of E. coli or Citrobacter freundii. Rather, about 45% nucleotide sequence homology and 40% deduced amino acid sequence homology were observed between the K. oxytoca beta-lactamase and TEM-1, a class A beta-lactamase which does not efficiently hydrolyze cephalosporins. Values of Km, relative Vmax, and relative Vmax/Km for the K. oxytoca beta-lactamase indicated that the enzyme is a penicillinase but that it can hydrolyze cefoperazone effectively and other broad-spectrum cephems weakly. Hence, the chromosomal beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca E23004 belongs to class A but differences in its amino acid sequence provide a broader spectrum of activity.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in neutropenic patients, we conducted a randomized prospective trial comparing the combination of ciprofloxacin and netilmicin against piperacillin plus netilmicin as an empiric treatment of fever in cancer patients with neutropenia. Of 214 evaluable episodes, 115 and 99 were randomly assigned to the ciprofloxacin and the piperacillin arms, respectively. The overall response rates were very similar (59 and 62% for the ciprofloxacin and piperacillin arms, respectively). The response for the gram-positive bacteremias was almost identical (around 40%); this low response was due in part to an outbreak of infection by a multiply resistant strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (for which the ciprofloxacin MIC was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml) which occurred during the second half of the trial. Among gram-negative bacteremias, 9 of 11 infections (82%) responded to the ciprofloxacin combination compared with 3 of 7 (43%) that responded to the piperacillin combination (P = 0.23). The incidences of persistent, profound neutropenia were comparable in both treatments, but the susceptibility of the gram-negative organism to ciprofloxacin and netilmicin was significantly higher than was susceptibility to the other combination. Ciprofloxacin was well tolerated, and patients were able to convert from intravenous to oral therapy in 64 of 115 episodes.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibition of bacterial adherence to bladder cells has been assumed to account for the beneficial action ascribed to cranberry juice and cranberry juice cocktail in the prevention of urinary tract infections (A. E. Sobota, J. Urol. 131:1013-1016, 1984). We have examined the effect of the cocktail and juice on the adherence of Escherichia coli expressing surface lectins of defined sugar specificity to yeasts, tissue culture cells, erythrocytes, and mouse peritoneal macrophages. Cranberry juice cocktail inhibited the adherence of urinary isolates expressing type 1 fimbriae (mannose specific) and P fimbriae [specific for alpha-D-Gal(1----4)-beta-D-Gal] but had no effect on a diarrheal isolate expressing a CFA/I adhesin. The cocktail also inhibited yeast agglutination by purified type 1 fimbriae. The inhibitory activity for type 1 fimbriated E. coli was dialyzable and could be ascribed to the fructose present in the cocktail; this sugar was about 1/10 as active as methyl alpha-D-mannoside in inhibiting the adherence of type 1 fimbriated bacteria. The inhibitory activity for the P fimbriated bacteria was nondialyzable and was detected only after preincubation of the bacteria with the cocktail. Cranberry juice, orange juice, and pineapple juice also inhibited adherence of type 1 fimbriated E. coli, most likely because of their fructose content. However, the two latter juices did not inhibit the P fimbriated bacteria. We conclude that cranberry juice contains at least two inhibitors of lectin-mediated adherence of uropathogens to eucaryotic cells. Further studies are required to establish whether these inhibitors play a role in vivo.\r"

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis appears to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. It differs from other autosomal dominant forms of EBS by the common findings of milia and atrophic scarring, as well as involvement of oral and/or ocular surfaces. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis is further differentiated from peeling skin syndrome by the presence of blisters and the absence of spontaneous continual exfoliation or peeling.\r"

  ".W": "A 34-year-old man with epidermodysplasia verruciformis showed increased natural killer (NK) cell activity in his peripheral blood cells, which was found to be due to abnormal expansion of large granular lymphocytes (LGL). Surface marker analysis of LGL in a two-color immunofluorescence test demonstrated that all LGL subsets, Leu-7+11-, Leu-7+11+, and Leu-7-11+, were increased. In contrast, his peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a remarkable decrease in response to T cell mitogens, which could not be restored by depletion of the LGL subpopulation from the mononuclear cells. Immunohistologic studies for dermal distribution of LGL showed numerous Leu-7+ cells but no Leu-11+ cells at the sites of delayed hypersensitivity reaction or interferon beta- or interferon gamma-injected sites. These findings suggest that the elevated NK cell activity in this patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis was caused by overall expansion of normal LGL subpopulations, but that the decreased T-cell mitogenic response represented a primary T-cell defect rather than a direct suppression by increased NK cells. It is noteworthy that despite this extraordinary increase of all LGL subpopulations in the blood, Leu-11+ NK cells never appeared in the skin.\r"

A 7-year-old boy and a 3-year-old girl presented with rapidly expanding masses on the scalp. Roentgenographic studies showed erosion of the underlying cranium in one case. Both lesions showed proliferations of elongated spindle cells in a focally myxoid matrix, together with areas of hemorrhage, vascular proliferation, and chronic inflammation. Occasional cells with atypical nuclei were observed, but mitotic figures were uncommon. Immunoperoxidase studies showed negative or equivocal staining for desmin, factor VIII-associated antigen, S100 protein, and macrophage antigen. In one lesion there was focal positivity for alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and in another lesion, some cells stained positively for smooth-muscle actin. Electron microscopy showed cells with dilated endoplasmic reticulum, bundles of microfilaments, pinocytotic vesicles, and focal external membrane material, features of myofibroblasts. Both lesions were excised and there has been no recurrence in 7 years in one case and 1 year in the other case. Cranial fasciitis is closely related to nodular fasciitis, but it has a predilection for the scalp of children. Despite its rapid growth, it has a benign clinical course and is cured by excision with or without curettage of the underlying bone. Our immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations indicate that, like nodular fasciitis, cranial fasciitis represents a proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.\r"

It is now clear that the functional activities described by the term ETAF are composed mainly of interleukin 1 alpha and interleukin 1 beta, although other epidermal cytokines may contribute to the biologic activity.

Older patients with angina appear to be adequately risk stratified by thallium stress tests. For patients requiring surgical intervention, aortoplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting have both resulted in relief of symptoms, but the follow-up is limited. We suggest that coronary artery bypass grafting with an ipsilateral internal mammary artery graft to the anomalous vessel is the procedure most likely to relieve ischemia and achieve good long-term results for both symptomatic relief and survival.\r"

More appropriate survival analytic techniques were applied to the data from the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Study of bipolar patients treated with lithium carbonate, imipramine hydrochloride, or both. An interaction between treatment and the nature of the index episode (the episode that brought the patients into the study) was found. In patients with manic index episodes, both lithium and the combination were superior to imipramine. In patients with depressive index episodes, the combination was significantly superior to imipramine, whereas lithium was indistinguishable from imipramine. The latter finding differs from the original analysis, which found the combination to be no different from the other two treatments for patients with a depressive index episode.\r"

Compared with normal controls, prepubertal children with major depressive disorder (MDD) had significantly higher familial rates of psychiatric disorders in both first- and second-degree relatives, especially MDD, alcoholism, and \"other\" (mostly anxiety) diagnoses. Relatives of children in the nonaffective psychiatric control (PC) group had low rates of alcoholism, high rates of other (anxiety) disorder diagnoses, and intermediate rates of MDD (accounted for by those children with separation anxiety). This suggests that prepubertal onset of major depression may be especially likely in families with a high aggregation of affective disorders when these families also have a high prevalence of alcoholism, and that a proportion of children without affective disorder but with separation anxiety disorder in this study were at high risk for the development of affective illness later in life. These results support the validity of prepubertal-onset depressive illness as a diagnostic category, and are consistent with high familial rates of MDD and other psychiatric disorders found in family studies of adolescent and early-onset adult probands with major affective disorders, and with studies of the offspring of parents with major affective disorders. Within the child MDD group substantial heterogeneity was found. Low familial rates of MDD were associated with suicidality and comorbid conduct disorder in the child probands. The highest familial rates of MDD, approximately threefold those in the normal controls, and all the bipolar relatives, were found in the families of prepubertal probands with MDD who never had a concrete suicidal plan or act and who were without comorbid conduct disorder. A useful nosological continuum in which to classify prepubertal MDD may be to place at one end those patients with comorbid conduct disorder and at the other end those patients with manifestations related to bipolarity, including hypomania, mania, and psychotic subtype.\r"

Workshop participants reviewed major issues in the following areas: (1) diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and epidemiology of the disorder; (2) critical issues in phototherapy research; (3) biologic effects of light and mechanism of action of phototherapy; (4) biologic abnormalities in SAD; and (5) animal models and their applicability to the study of SAD. Most research evidence to date supports the efficacy of phototherapy in the treatment of SAD. However, considerable controversy remains concerning its mechanism of action and the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. These and other unresolved issues are reviewed, and areas of consensus in the field are identified.\r"

While results from these assays are available considerably earlier than are those from culture, the assays have been less sensitive and specific than culture when used in some patient populations. This review summarizes results from investigations into the performance of culture and the two most widely used antigen assays, documents factors that can contribute to false-positive or false-negative results, and, in light of these factors, makes recommendations for the selection of methods for detection of C trachomatis from genital specimens.\r"

There were no false-negative results in serum specimens, although one third of vitreous specimens that were tested 34 hours or more post mortem were negative in patients with AIDS. There were no false-positive results in control specimens from patients at autopsy without evidence of AIDS, despite prolonged postmortem intervals producing hemolysis and autolysis of the specimens. Postmortem enzyme immunoassay testing of blood and vitreous humor may be useful to screen for HIV infection in high-risk groups and for diagnosis of patients with histopathologic evidence of AIDS for medical, legal, and epidemiologic purposes.\r"

They were treated with radiation therapy alone. Langerhans' cells were identified by immunohistochemical staining for S100 protein. Langerhans' cells were present mainly in the intercellular spaces of tumor cells. The LC infiltration rates were higher in stage II (31.0%) or stage III (26.9%) than in stage I (17.5%) or stage IV (7.8%). The patients with LC infiltration showed a significantly better five-year survival rate than those without LC infiltration (68% and 56.1%, respectively). This significant difference was observed especially in stage III and it was suggestive in stage IV diseases. These results suggest that LCs in cancer nests may play a significant role in the immunologic defense against cancer in advanced stage of cervical cancer.\r"

Twelve patients suffered 14 major complications, including perforated ulcer in 3 patients; pancreatitis in 3 patients; pneumatosis coli in 2 patients; and cholecystitis, colonic necrosis, appendicitis, incarcerated umbilical hernia, pancreatic abscess, and toxic epidermal necrolysis in 1 patient each. Aggressive management of the patients included laparotomy in all but 2 patients with mild pancreatitis and the patient with toxic epidermal necrolysis, who was treated as a patient with a severe burn. In all of the patients, there was a resolution of these complications, except in one 59-year-old man with fatal hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Eleven of the 14 complications occurred during the initial hospitalization. The fatal case of pancreatitis was 1 of 5 (9%) operative mortalities in the entire series. Fifty operative survivors have been followed up for an average of 19 months, with four late deaths (8%) related to rejection. The actuarial probability of survival in patients discharged from the hospital was 90% at 12, 24, and 48 months.\r"

To compare their safety and efficacy, the courses of 157 patients treated for biliary obstruction were examined. Outcome was judged by mortality, complications, and need for further intervention. Forty-eight patients underwent endoscopic papillotomy (43 [90%] had stone disease) with two deaths and 11 cases of (23% incidence) of cholangitis. Pancreatitis developed in 9 (19%). Twenty-seven patients (56%) required further endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical intervention. Sixty-five patients underwent transhepatic drainage (58 [89%] had malignant neoplasms) with a 28% (n = 18) mortality rate. Cholangitis developed in 26 (40%), and 50 (77%) required further transhepatic or surgical intervention. Forty-four patients underwent surgery (22 [50%] had stone disease and 12 [27%] had malignant neoplasms) with a 4.5% (n = 2) mortality rate. Cholangitis developed in 3 (7%), pancreatitis developed in 2 (4.5%), and bleeding developed in 1 (2%). Eight (18%) required further intervention. While endoscopic papillotomy provides efficacious treatment for stone disease, surgery provides a more expeditious, less morbid relief for malignant obstruction.\r"

Correlation between the two procedures was 100%. The anatomic location of thrombosis and the extent of disease were identical in both studies. The presence of intraluminal clot by angiodynography is detected by looking for changes in the venous color-flow patterns and in the B-mode image. Newer clots have low echogenicity and are seen as large black areas in the gray-scale image. Older clots are more echogenic. The presence of enlarged venous collateral veins as well as absence of color flow and inability to compress the veins confirm the diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis. The results of angiodynography alone can be used safely in diagnosing acute deep venous thrombosis in patients. Equally important, treatment can be withheld safety in a patient with normal results.\r"

Where there was concordance, the noninvasive tests predicted the presence or absence of hemodynamically severe carotid stenosis (75% or greater cross-sectional area reduction) with a sensitivity of 96.8%, a specificity of 95.9%, an accuracy of 96.2%, and positive and negative predictive values of 91.0% and 98.6%, respectively. Of the 538 study arteries, only four (0.74%) angiographically severe lesions escaped detection by both noninvasive tests. Sources of diagnostic error for both tests were defined. We believe that the combination of duplex ultrasound and ocular pneumoplethysmography significantly improves the overall assessment of carotid atherosclerosis.\r"

It is hoped that a double-blind controlled trial of medical therapies and another for surgical therapies will be conducted to elucidate optimum management of this condition.\r"

  ".W": "Susceptibility of a human astrocytoma cell line to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection was investigated. Infection of U-373MG astrocytoma cells with two strains of HCMV resulted in both production of extracellular, infectious virus and expression of immediate early and early antigens within 18 hours and late antigens after 72 hours of infection. The kinetics of infection in U-373MG cells were the same as in human diploid fibroblasts (MRC-5). Since HCMV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have reportedly been found in astrocytic cells in vivo, we studied the possible interaction between HCMV and HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) elements in this cellular environment. HCMV infection transactivated the LTR of HIV-1 and HIV-2 to similar levels. Interestingly, transfection of these cells with infectious HIV-1 provirus did not result in expression of gag, env, or F proteins detectable by immunofluorescence. However, provirus gene expression was not completely silent, since it transactivated HIV-1 LTR. The level of this transactivation was similar to that seen following cotransfection with a tat expression vector. These results suggest that opportunistic infection with HCMV may reactivate latent HIV genomes in glial cells.\r"

After eight weeks of treatment, flosequinan significantly improved treadmill exercise time, increased peak achieved oxygen consumption, and improved the New York Heart Association symptom grade when compared with placebo. One patient in the placebo group died and another was withdrawn because heart failure worsened. One patient in the flosequinan group was lost to follow up but there were no other withdrawals. Flosequinan was well tolerated with few adverse effects, and it may prove to be a useful addition to diuretics and digoxin in the treatment of chronic cardiac failure.\r"

Blood pressure increased significantly during cold immersion but peak atrial and peak early diastolic transmitral velocities and their ratio (A:E) were unchanged. There was no correlation between changes in Doppler variables and changes in calculated mean arterial blood pressure during the test. Heart rate changes were variable and not related to changes in blood pressure. In individual people the change in pulse interval during cold immersion was significantly and inversely correlated with the change in the A:E ratio. The large acute increase in arterial pressure seen during the cold pressor test in normal volunteers had no consistent effect on the transmitral velocity profile although small changes in heart rate were associated with large changes in A:E ratio. The effect of small changes in heart rate may be of considerable importance in determining transmitral velocity profiles. Thus in clinical and experimental studies in which the heart rate is not controlled, Doppler data on transmitral flow should be interpreted with caution.\r"

The DIF in eight patients showed negative results among whom seven remained negative. Six patients out of 24 showed weakly positive fluorescence and ten patients showed strong positive fluorescence. The IIF was negative in 17 patients and positive in seven patients who also showed positive DIF. During a follow-up period of 20 months, one of eight patients with negative DIF relapsed compared with two of six patients with weak positive DIF and five of 10 patients with strong DIF. Five patients with strong DIF for IgG also had C3, of whom three relapsed, compared with five of 19 patients who were negative for C3. Four of seven patients with positive IIF relapsed compared with four of 17 with negative IIF. It is suggested that repeated DIF tests in pemphigus patients, who are in clinical remission, may serve as an indicator for the immunological activity and be of help in the management of these cases.\r"

Combined comparisons, using odds ratios with confidence intervals, were made of the rates of livebirths at term or preterm and the sum of term and preterm deliveries, miscarriages, stillbirths and neonatal deaths. All but one comparison failed to show a significant benefit. Only the preterm delivery versus the term delivery comparison approached statistical significance. There were average deficiencies of quality apparent in the studies, and a test for heterogeneity among the studies was positive, but these caveats do not diminish the conclusion that progestogens should not be used outside of randomized trials at present. If trials are done, they should include only women with demonstrated hormonal abnormalities who are carrying a live fetus as shown by ultrasonography.\r"

Its potential role in women with recurrent miscarriage due to luteal phase deficiency has been suggested, but its efficacy has not yet been demonstrated. Three controlled trials of progesterone treatment in women with recurrent miscarriage have shown small, but not statistically significant, increases in the rates of pregnancies that continue beyond 20 weeks in the treated groups. None of these studies had sufficient statistical power to detect a clinically significant improvement in outcome but pooling the results of these studies using the principles of meta-analysis has allowed an overall effect of treatment to be calculated. The resulting odds ratio for pregnancies reaching at least 20 weeks gestation was 3.09 (95% CI 1.28 to 7.42) which indicates that there is evidence to support the suggestion that progesterone given in early pregnancy is useful in women with recurrent miscarriage. Although, before progesterone is used in this way its efficacy in women with recurrent miscarriage due to luteal phase deficiency must be assessed in prospective double-blind randomized controlled trials mounted in the light of the results of this meta-analysis.\r"

By four months the severity of DR on colour photographs had deteriorated by at least one level in at least one eye in eight patients. In four patients the DR did not deteriorate. Assessment of anatomical abnormalities by severity of DR on colour photographs correlated well with the functional abnormalities of the blood-retinal barrier(s) assessed by VF, especially for the macular field. Comparison of permeability index data in the patients developing preproliferative or proliferative features of DR (group A) with the same data in patients who did not develop such changes (group B) indicated that group A patients had more severe DR than did group B patients at entry. Grading of colour photographs showed a similar trend but with greater overlap. Considerable overlap in fluorescein permeability remained between those subjects with no visible DR and those with microaneurysms with or without haemorrhages and small hard exudates.\r"

This fibrinolytic activity was attributed to the presence of a plasminogen activator, which was immunochemically identified as urinary-type plasminogen activator (uPA) by antibody neutralization assay, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. The molecular weight (mol wt) of this uPA was 54,000 and was present as the single chain form, although a small amount was detected in a higher mol wt complex indicative of a uPA-inhibitor complex. Treatment of membrane preparations with Triton X-100, 3 mol/L KCl, and 0.1 mol/L glycine, (pH 2.3), but not 10 mmol/L ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), removed the uPA from the membrane. This suggests that uPA is a peripheral membrane protein and that metal ions do not mediate protein-membrane association. Immunofluorescent staining revealed the presence of uPA on the outer surface of the platelet in preparations of intact unstimulated platelets. Thus, uPA is associated with the outer leaflet of the platelet membrane and may be involved with the acceleration of thrombus degradation observed with platelet-rich thrombi.\r"

The CD34+ progenitor cell population was further separated into myeloid plus erythroid progenitors (CD34+, CD10-) v B-lymphoid precursors (coexpressing CD34 and CD10) by two-color FACS. Both CD34+ progenitor cell subsets strongly expressed c-myb protein by the immunoperoxidase assay. A flow cytometric assay was then developed which permitted simultaneous detection of a cell-surface antigen (to characterize lineage and stage of maturation) and the nuclear oncoprotein. This assay confirmed that CD34+ cells were strongly positive for c-myb expression and also allowed quantitative comparisons of c-myb expression in selected populations of other normal hematopoietic cells. Most human bone marrow cells appear to express some level of c-myb protein, although the CD34+ progenitor cell population expresses the highest amount.\r"

Extremely high levels (14,000 U/mL) of Multi-CSF were detected in the sera and in media conditioned by various hematopoietic tissues of the transplanted animals. While spleen, peritoneal, and peripheral blood cellularity increased approximately 10-fold, 10-fold, and 50-fold, respectively, bone marrow cellularity decreased twofold. Progenitor numbers were depressed twofold in the bone marrow but elevated more than 100-fold in the spleen and peritoneum.

Neither the infected cells from hematopoietic tissues of the primary mice, nor autonomous mast cell-lines that grew from these cells in liquid culture produced any overt disease when transplanted into normal or sublethally irradiated secondary recipients. In contrast, injection into mice of autonomous FDC-P1 cells transformed by the same retroviral construct led to tumor formation in vivo within 4 weeks. Thus, dysregulated Multi-CSF expression by normal hematopoietic cells produces a fatal but nonneoplastic myeloproliferative syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human interleukin-5 (rhIL-5), in either liquid or semi-solid cultures, selectively induced eosinophil production from normal human bone marrow, with no activity on other cell lineages. The time course of eosinophil production induced by murine IL-5, rhIL-3, and rh granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) was similar to rhIL-5. The rate of eosinophil maturation in vitro was independent of the stimulating cytokine, mature eosinophils being produced after 4 to 5 weeks in liquid culture with each of these cytokines. The eosinophils produced in response to each cytokine were morphologically indistinguishable, and had the ultrastructural features of maturity except that the electron-dense material in the granules had not formed into crystalline cores. Neither rhIL-1 nor rhIL-6 alone, or in combination with rhIL-5 or rhIL-3, induced eosinophil differentiation or proliferation under the conditions used. rhIL-3 and rhGMCSF induced more eosinophil colonies than rhIL-5, rhIL-5 had an additive, not synergistic, effect on eosinophil colony production when combined with either rhIL-3 or rhGMCSF, suggesting that rhIL-5 stimulates a smaller and possibly different population of eosinophil progenitors. However, rhIL-5 induced the greatest eosinophil production in liquid cultures, suggesting that although it may act on a smaller population of precursors, it is able to stimulate more proliferative steps than either rhIL-3 or rhGMCSF.\r"

By electroblotting, the 60 Kd protein was identified as the pp60c-src, the normal cellular homolog of the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus. We have examined the intracellular distribution of the pp60c-src within platelets. Use of immunoprecipitation and electrotransfer to study isolated membranes, alpha-granules, lysosomes, and dense granules (also termed dense bodies) revealed that pp60c-src was highly enriched in dense bodies. In view of the prominent role of these granules in platelet function, We postulate that protein phosphorylation by activated pp60c-src is involved in early steps of platelet activation.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six healthy volunteers were stimulated with the mitogens phytohemaglutinin and concanavalin A, and also cocultivated with human epidermal cell cultures. Incubation times with mitogens and epidermal cells were four days and stimulation of the lymphocytes by mitogens was confirmed by standard 3H-thymidine uptake. Standard transmission electron microscopy showed that in the mitogen-driven system 20% to 60% (33 +/- 15%) and in the epidermal cell-driven system 5% to 15% (8 +/- 4%) of the lymphoid cells exhibited mild to moderate indentation of the nuclei with nuclear contour indices (NCI) of 4.6 to 6.5 but no Sezary cells were observed (cells with NCI greater than 6.5 and up to 19.2). In the mitogen-stimulated preparation 2% to 5% (3 +/- 1%) of the lymphoid cells showed nuclear multilobulation resembling the cells seen in adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia. Incubation of mononuclear cells for longer periods of up to 4 weeks with mitogens and exogenous IL-2 resulted in no further morphologic changes. Using an indirect immunogold technique at the electron microscopic level, the cells showing nuclear indentation or lobulation were shown to bear both T helper (CD4) and T suppressor (CD8) cell phenotypes in a similar ratio to the total numbers of T helper and T suppressor cells present. Mitogens and epidermal cells are thus not able to induce a morphologic change to Sezary cells in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes.\r"

Each of these 16 extranodal, noncutaneous lymphoid neoplasms exhibited clonal immunoglobulin heavy and/or light chain and lacked T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene rearrangements. The patterns of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements included solitary and multiple barely perceptible to faint bands, solitary clear and definite bands, and solitary high-intensity bands superimposed on a background of multiple less-intense bands. Three ocular adnexal lymphoid neoplasms exhibited bcl-1 or bcl-2 gene rearrangements. None of the 16 lymphoid neoplasms contained EBV DNA sequences. Two patients developed a histopathologically confirmed malignant lymphoma in an extranodal site. None of the remaining 14 patients developed additional lymphoid neoplasms during a mean follow-up period of 30 months, despite conservative therapy. These results demonstrate that extranodal, noncutaneous lymphoid neoplasms meeting the histopathologic and immunophenotypic criteria for benign lymphoid hyperplasia frequently contain occult monoclonal and oligoclonal B-cell populations representing a continuous and progressive spectrum of B-cell neoplasia up to and including malignant lymphoma.\r"

Monocytes deficient in IL-1 production could be restored to normal production after incubation with indomethacin in three of five deficient patients. Monocytes from the other two patients could not be induced to generate IL-1, suggesting either an intrinsic deficiency or an alternate inhibitory mechanism as the basis for the IL-1 deficiency observed. In patients with SCID who were transplanted with HLA-haplotype disparate, T-cell depleted marrow without preparative chemotherapy, deficiency of monocyte IL-1 production was correlated with graft failure. Immune reconstitution was achieved in IL-1 deficient patients only when donor monocytes were also engrafted. We hypothesize that deficiencies of IL-1 production may contribute to the heterogeneous expression of combined immunodeficiencies, and may also restrict the engraftment and functional development of allogeneic lymphoid progenitors from a T-cell depleted marrow graft.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the influence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) on recurrent leukemia and survival after allogeneic marrow transplantation, we studied 1,202 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) given unmodified marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings. Proportional hazards regression models using acute GVHD and chronic GVHD as time-dependent covariates demonstrated a significant association of GVHD with a decreased relative risk (RR, 0.33 to 0.42) of relapse in patients with ANL, ALL, and CML transplanted in advanced disease. Among patients developing either acute or chronic GVHD, treatment failure (that is, mortality or relapse) was decreased in patients with ALL transplanted in relapse (RR = 0.70, P less than .033) and CML in blast crisis (RR = 0.37, P less than .009). This effect was independent of age, sex, preparative regimen, GVHD prophylaxis, or length of follow-up. Five-year actuarial estimates were derived for the subset of 657 patients who survived in remission 150 days after transplant and were at risk for development of chronic GVHD. Among patients with ANL in first remission or CML in chronic phase, GVHD had an adverse effect on survival and no apparent influence on relapse. Among patients with ANL and ALL transplanted in relapse, the probability of relapse after day 150 was 74% without [corrected] GVHD, 45% with acute and chronic GVHD, 35% with [corrected] only acute GVHD, and 34% with only chronic GVHD (P less than .001). Actuarial survival in these four GVHD groups was 25%, 34%, 59%, and 62%, respectively (P less than .009). Among patients with CML in acceleration or blast crisis, the probability of relapse after day 150 was 65% without GVHD and 36% with acute and/or chronic GVHD (P less than .017). We conclude that acute and chronic GVHD were associated with a durable antileukemic effect and improved survival in patients transplanted in advanced stages of ALL and CML.\r"

To evaluate postgrafting prophylaxis for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the patients were randomized to receive either methotrexate and cyclosporine (n = 43) or cyclosporine alone (n = 50). Methotrexate/cyclosporine significantly reduced the incidence and severity of acute GVHD, and improved early survival. This report updates the results with a 3.0 to 4.5 year follow-up. Methotrexate/cyclosporine did not interfere with sustained hematopoietic engraftment, although granulocyte recovery to 1,000/microL was delayed by five days on the average. The incidence of chronic GVHD was identical in the two groups (26% v 24%). Disease-free 3-year survival was slightly better in the methotrexate/cyclosporine group (65% v 54%), but this benefit was restricted to patients with CML (73% v 54%), while no improvement was seen in patients with ANL (41% v 41%). In contrast to patients with CML (relapse rates 8% v 9%), the early survival benefit among patients with ANL given methotrexate/cyclosporine was offset by an increase in leukemic relapses (29% v 16%).\r"

  ".W": "Under serum-deprived and chemically defined culture conditions, the growth of Rauscher erythroleukemia cells is mediated by an autocrine mechanism. The growth-promoting activity is produced by fresh or irradiated cells and resembles the activity of interleukin-3 (IL-3) in its ability to sustain colony formation from three of four IL-3-dependent cell lines and to induce formation of granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colonies and, in the presence of erythropoietin (Ep), of erythroid bursts and mixed erythroid colonies. IL-3, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, GM colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, M-CSF, Ep, and media conditioned by concanavalin A-stimulated mouse spleen cells or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated LBRM 33 cells were unable to induce proliferation of the Rauscher erythroleukemia cells. Northern analysis of total and polyA-selected RNA extracted from untreated Rauscher cells or from cells 24 hours after irradiation showed the presence of message for M-CSF but not for IL-3, IL-1, GM-CSF, or G-CSF. The production of IL-6 was excluded by a sensitive bioassay. These results indicate that the autocrine growth of the Rauscher cell line is mediated by a growth factor different from IL-3, but with similar biological activity. Activation of the expression of such a growth factor during viral infection may contribute to the generation of leukemic cells that have the property to grow in vitro and generate Rauscher erythroleukemia cell lines.\r"

All four antibodies abrogated CSF-1-dependent colony formation by human bone marrow-derived macrophage precursors and by mouse NIH-3T3 cells expressing a transduced human c-fms gene. In addition, one of these antibodies (designated MoAb 2-4A5) interfered with the ligand-independent proliferation of NIH-3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic, mutant c-fms allele. Unlike CSF-1 itself, neither MoAb 2-4A5 nor the other three inhibitory antibodies (MoAbs 12-2D6, 12-3A1, and 12-3A3) induced CSF-1R internalization or degradation. These antibodies should prove useful not only for identifying and quantitating CSF-1R on receptor-bearing cells but for abrogating specific receptor signals that govern the proliferation and survival of human mononuclear phagocytes.\r"

Effects on hematopoietic colony formation with respect to number, size, and cellular composition were evaluated. In agreement with previous reports, IL-6 acts synergistically with IL-3 to stimulate increased numbers of granulocyte/macrophage (GM) and multilineage colonies in day-2 and day-4 post-5-FU BM cultures. Furthermore, day 4 but not day 2 post-5-FU BM showed enhanced GM colony formation when stimulated with IL-6 plus interleukin-4 (IL-4) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In contrast, IL-6 did not increase the number of colonies supported by M-CSF or GM-CSF. Nevertheless IL-6 interacted with all factors, including M-CSF and GM-CSF, to stimulate an increase in colony size. Many of these myeloid colonies attained a diameter of greater than or equal to 0.5 mm, suggesting they derive from high proliferative potential cells (HPP-CFC). The response of normal and day-8 post-5-FU BM containing high numbers of more mature progenitors was also assessed. We found IL-6 enhanced colony formation by lineage-restricted megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors in the presence of IL-3 and IL-4 plus erythropoietin (Epo), respectively. The sum of these results shows that IL-6 interacts with a variety of factors to regulate the growth of progenitor cells at different stages of lineage commitment and maturation.\r"

IL-3-cultured cells retained a multipotent response to IL-3 in colony assays but were restricted to formation of granulocyte colonies in G-CSF and granulocyte or macrophage colonies in GM-CSF. Culture of bone marrow cells in IL-3 also led to accumulation of large numbers of eosinophils and basophils. These data contrast with the effects of G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 in seven-day cultures. Here both GM-CSF and IL-3 amplified total CFC that had similar multipotential colony-forming capability in either factor. G-CSF, on the other hand, depleted IL-3-responsive colony-forming cells dramatically, apparently by causing these cells to mature into granulocytes. The data suggest that a large proportion of IL-3-responsive cells in human bone marrow express receptors for G-CSF and can respond to this factor, the majority becoming neutrophils. Furthermore, the CFC maintained for 21 days in IL-3 may be a functionally distinct population from that produced after seven days culture of bone marrow cells in either IL-3 or GM-CSF.\r"

Previous in vitro studies suggest that tumor regressions observed in a phase I clinical trial of 3F8 may be attributable to complement activation by 3F8 and to 3F8-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with lymphocytes. We now describe 3F8-mediated ADCC of GD2-positive tumor targets (melanoma and neuroblastoma) with human granulocytes and report that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhanced this phenomenon. Cytotoxicity required binding of 3F8 to the low-affinity Fc receptor type III (CD16) on the granulocytes and was poor with tumor-binding monoclonal antibodies of other immunoglobulin (ie, non-IgG3) subclasses. GM-CSF (2 to 20 ng/mL) increased ADCC by 93% to 267% at limiting dilutions of 3F8 (1 microgram/mL). With most GD2-positive cell lines tested, this effect translated into a tenfold or greater augmentation in 3F8 efficiency at mediating ADCC. Comparable enhancement occurred whether GM-CSF was present in the ADCC assay or granulocytes were incubated with GM-CSF and washed before the assay. Nonoxidative mechanisms may be important for ADCC since 3F8 mediated ADCC with granulocytes from two children with chronic granulomatous disease; this cytotoxicity was also enhanced by GM-CSF. Since GM-CSF induces a neutrophilia in patients, our data suggest that this cytokine may have the potential of amplifying 3F8 antitumor activity in patients by increasing effector cell numbers and by priming granulocytes for greater cytotoxicity.\r"

Cells from most acute leukemias (19 of 22), irrespective of their subtype (T, common or nonlymphoid leukemias), as well as T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas and peripheral T-cell lymphomas expressed only the p70-75 beta subunit of the IL-2 receptor. Cells from the more mature B-cell neoplasms, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, expressed predominantly alpha beta IL-2 receptors (11 of 14). In contrast to these results, most cell lines established from hematopoietic malignancies do not express either chain of the IL-2 receptor. Further studies are necessary to determine the exact function of the IL-2R p70-75 beta subunit in immature hematopoietic cells, but its wide distribution throughout the hematopoietic system suggests that IL-2 may play a role in the early stages of hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".U": "89229449\r", 
  ".W": "A human leukemic cell line KU 812 was recently established and described as a basophilic cell line. In the present study we show that KU 812 and two of its clones are at least bipotent: in addition to a minor component of basophils, the majority of KU 812 cells belongs to the erythroid cell lineage with a significant percentage (about 15%) of mature hemoglobinized erythroblasts. This terminal differentiation is associated with the synchronized synthesis of the main erythroid proteins, including glycophorins, spectrin beta chain, band 3, and hemoglobin. The predominant hemoglobins are adult, fetal, and Bart's hemoglobin. Adult hemoglobin represented up to 75% of all hemoglobins in the KU 812 F clone in passages containing a high number of mature erythroblasts. Transcripts of all human globin chains were present with ten times less embryonic chain messenger RNA (mRNA) than alpha-, beta- or gamma-chain mRNA. Hemin slightly increased the total hemoglobin production of the cell line, especially gamma-globin chain synthesis, but did not modify the percentage of hemoglobinized cells. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) had a complex effect, inducing a proportion of KU 812 cells to adhere to the plastic culture flask. The adherent cell fraction expressed a very low level of specific erythroid proteins, but their ultrastructure was consistent with immature erythroid cells. In contrast, approximately 40% of the nonadherent cells were mature erythroid cells. Cell-sorting experiments showed that this paradoxic effect of PMA is mostly due to cell selection, the more mature cells being unable to adhere. In addition, KU 812 F was found to be sensitive to erythropoietin, which slightly increased its plating efficiency range (from 0% to 50%) in semisolid medium and enhanced hemoglobin accumulation twofold. In binding experiments using 125I erythropoietin, a single class of high-affinity Epo receptors (Kd: 250 pM) was detected by binding with a density of 205 receptors per cell. The KU 812 cell line is therefore a unique model for studying cell commitment toward different hematopoietic lineages and erythroid differentiation.\r"

Neither splenectomy nor simple transplantation of normal marrow after lethal irradiation cures the anemia but instead causes rapid deterioration and death of the mutant unless additional prophylactic procedures are used. In this report, we show that normal marrow transplantation preceded by sublethal irradiation increases but does not normalize RBC count. The mutant RBCs but not all the WBCs are replaced by donor cells. Splenectomy of the improved recipient causes a dramatic decrease in RBC count, indicating that the mutant spleen is a site of donor-origin erythropoiesis as well as of RBC destruction. Injections of iron dextran did not improve RBC counts. Transplantation of primary recipient marrow cells into a secondary host with a heritable stem cell deficiency (W/Wv) corrects the defect caused by residence of the normal cells in the sphha/sphha host. The original +/+ donor cells replace the RBCs of the secondary host, and the RBC count is normalized. Results indicate that the environment in the sphha/sphha host is detrimental to normal (as well as mutant) erythroid cells but the restriction is not transmitted.\r"

  ".U": "89229452\r", 
  ".W": "A major problem in using murine models for studies of bone marrow allograft rejection in leukemia patients is the narrow margin in which graft rejection can be analyzed. In mice irradiated with greater than 9 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) rejection is minimal, whereas after administration of 8 Gy TBI, which spares a significant number of clonable T cells, a substantial frequency of host stem cells can also be detected. In current murine models, unlike in humans, bone marrow allograft rejection is generally associated with full autologous hematopoietic reconstitution. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the myeloablative drug dimethyl myleran (DMM) on chimerism status following transplantation of T cell-depleted allogenic bone marrow (using C57BL/6 donors and C3H/HeJ recipients, conditioned with 8 Gy TBI). Donor type chimerism 1 to 2 months post-transplant of 1 to 3 x 10(6) bone marrow cells was markedly enhanced by using DMM one day after TBI and prior to transplantation. Conditioning with cyclophosphamide instead of DMM, in combination with 8 Gy TBI, did not enhance engraftment of donor type cells. Artificial reconstitution of T cells, after conditioning with TBI plus DMM, by adding mature thymocytes, or presensitization with irradiated donor type spleen cells 1 week before TBI and DMM, led to strong graft rejection and consequently to severe anemia. The anti-donor responses in these models were proportional to the number of added T cells and to the number of cells used for presensitization, and they could be neutralized by increasing the bone marrow inoculum. These results demonstrate the potential of DMM to facilitate engraftment in unsensitized mice in which the host stem cells may compete with donor type cells; the use of DMM to create models in which mechanisms of immune rejection can be studied without interference due to stem cell competition; and that bone marrow allograft rejection may be overcome by increasing the bone marrow inoculum in these stringent models.\r"

  ".W": "Leukemic relapse following bone marrow transplant (BMT) is generally due to the recurrence in recipient cells, but may rarely occur as a result of donor cell transformation. Donor cell relapse is generally identified using cytogenetic markers such as the sex chromosomes. Recently, molecular techniques have been used to identify the origin of bone marrow cells by their DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms. We describe the case of a male pediatric patient who had a leukemic relapse 30 months following BMT from his sister. Both cytogenetic and molecular techniques were used to identify the origin of the leukemic relapse. Cytogenetic analyses indicated the absence of the Y chromosome and the presence of a donor cell type 9qh polymorphism, suggesting a donor cell relapse. Molecular analyses also indicated the absence of the Y chromosome but demonstrated the recurrence of recipient DNA markers from three other chromosomes, suggesting a recipient cell relapse. While the leukemic cell lineage cannot be definitively assigned in this case, our results suggest that caution must be exercised when assigning leukemic cell lineage following post-BMT relapse.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen patients with acute rhabdomyolysis were evaluated with low field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and the results compared with those obtained using computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US). With MR imaging, abnormal muscles with areas of increased signal intensity were seen in every patient, which probably reflects increased water content or increased mobility of water molecules caused by inflammatory reaction and oedema in the injured and necrotic muscles. Computed tomography without intravenous contrast medium demonstrated abnormal muscles in most patients examined with this modality. The CT findings consisted of areas of focal hypodensity in muscles. With US, abnormal muscles were seen in less than half of the patients studied. The normal structure of striated muscle was focally disturbed and areas of both decreased and increased echogenicity were found. Magnetic resonance imaging had a higher sensitivity in the detection of abnormal muscles than CT or US (100%, 62% and 42%, respectively). The findings of all these modalities are non-specific, but together with the clinical and laboratory data they confirm the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The information gained from imaging studies is useful in the assessment of the extent and distribution of rhabdomyolysis. The precise identification of affected muscle compartments by MR imaging is valuable when surgical fasciotomy is considered for treatment; the procedure can then be appropriately directed to the compartments with clearly abnormal muscles.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that thiol-containing collagen antagonists (penicillamine) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (Captopril and CL242817) ameliorate endothelial dysfunction in irradiated rat lung. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the non-thiol ACE inhibitor CGS13945 also modifies radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in rats sacrificed 2 months after a single dose (0-30 Gy) of 60 Co gamma rays to the right hemithorax. The CGS13945 was administered in the feed continuously after irradiation at a regimen of 30 mg (kg body weight)-1 day-1. Four markers of lung endothelial function were monitored: ACE activity, plasminogen activator (PLA) activity, and prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TXA2) production. Right lung ACE and PLA activities decreased with increasing radiation dose, and CGS13945 significantly ameliorated both responses. Dose-reduction factors (DRF) for the inhibitor were 1.80 for ACE activity and 1.41 for PLA activity (p less than 0.05). In contrast, lung PGI2 and TXA2 production increased with increasing radiation dose, and CGS13945 did not influence either response significantly. Thus the ACE inhibitor CGS13945 modifies radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in rats, indicating that the presence of a thiol group is not essential for therapeutic efficacy in this class of compounds. On the other hand, CGS13945 exhibits a differential sparing of radiation-induced pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, as does penicillamine. A structure-function analysis of the present and previous data indicates that all of the ACE inhibitors tested (Captopril, CL242817 and CGS13945) spare the radiation-induced suppression in lung ACE and PLA activity; all of the thiol compounds tested (penicillamine, Captopril and CL242817) spare the radiation-induced elevation in lung PGI2 and TXA2 production; and the thiol ACE inhibitors (Captopril and CL242817) spare all four endothelial responses. These data confirm a novel and potentially important application for ACE inhibitors as modifiers of radiation-induced lung injury, and suggest that there are at least two components to their mechanism of therapeutic action in this model.\r"

The Teflon granuloma that occurs after the injection anchors the submucosal ureter, thereby preventing reflux. This paper reviews the ultrasound and cystographic findings in 88 patients with 115 refluxing ureters followed-up for periods ranging from 3 months to 3 years. Reflux disappeared in 91 ureters (79.1%) and the degree of reflux improved in 22 ureters (19.1%). In this follow-up study, the size of the granuloma on ultrasound was assessed in relation to the number of injections, the total volume of Polytef paste used and the outcome of the procedure. A well circumscribed granuloma was seen at the orifices of 92 ureters. There was no ureteric granuloma evident in 23 ureters and Teflon plaques were found at the trigone in six patients. Complications were rare. One large granuloma caused severe obstruction requiring re-implantation. The size of the granuloma appears to depend on individual tissue reaction rather than on the other factors. The presence or the size of the granuloma bears no direct relationship to the success of the procedure.\r"

A bladder regimen was emphasised during the study. Continence was improved according to micturition charting and a pad test in both groups. Terodiline at 25 mg/day, however, gave significantly better results than placebo. In patients with a subnormal bladder capacity (less than or equal to 150 ml), a significant increase in capacity was recorded on cystometry during medication with terodiline but not with placebo. The improved continence seen in the placebo group was probably due to the non-specific bladder training achieved by the child's increased awareness and adult involvement during treatment. The even better results attained in the terodiline group shows this drug to be a valuable adjunct to a bladder regimen in children with urge incontinence, particularly since no important adverse effects were noted during an 8-week period.\r"

Treatment did not influence the maximum urethral closure pressure, which remained unchanged at about 16 cm of water with the bladder substitute at rest and filled to its maximum cystometric capacity. At storage urethrocystometry, the treatment resulted in a decrease in the amplitude of the peristaltic contractions of about 10 cm of water to approximately 45 cm of water. Accordingly, the effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation and anticholinergic suppression was found to be insufficient to achieve nocturnal continence in patients with ileocaecal bladder replacement.\r"

The new system contains a solid bactericide (povidone iodine) pellet enclosed in a porous cartridge at the drain port of the urine collection bag. A catheterised rabbit model was used. The urine drainage bags were challenged daily for 8 days with an auxotrophically marked uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli at the outlet tube. The bag urine was infected with the marked organism in 10 of the 11 rabbits in the control group (conventional collection bags) in 3.8 +/- 1.03 days and in only 1 of the 13 rabbits fitted with the RCG. The RCG effectively prevents contamination of the urine drainage bag and thus may play an important role in reducing the incidence of nosocomial urinary tract infections.\r"

The specificity of elevated HCG and LDH was 100 and 93% respectively. The comparable sensitivity was 32 and 47%. Serum LDH could not discriminate between patients with clinical stage I seminoma, prior to orchiectomy, and those with benign testicular lesions. In patients with advanced metastatic seminoma subjected to orchiectomy, serum LDH was increased in 82%, but elevated HCG was found in only 40%. After cisplatin-based chemotherapy, falsely elevated LDH was observed in 7 of 37 tumour-free patients, but HCG was normal in all patients with no evidence of disease. Six patients with residual tumour after chemotherapy had normal LDH and 4 of them had elevated HCG; 70% of the relapses in seminoma patients were associated with increased LDH (64%) and/or HCG (48%). In seminoma patients with comparable disease extension, elevated HCG seemed to be correlated with a high risk of relapse. Patients with normal pre-treatment LDH had a lower relapse-free survival rate than patients with elevated LDH. HCG is a highly specific tumour marker in seminoma with a rather low sensitivity. HCG is particularly useful for the primary diagnosis in patients with testicular lesions and during monitoring of chemotherapy in seminoma patients. LDH is less specific than HCG. Both markers should be analysed during follow-up of seminoma patients, since 70% of relapses are associated with an increase in one or both markers. Elevated pre-treatment HCG, but not elevated LDH, seems to indicate an increased risk of relapse in patients with seminoma.\r"

Scanning was by means of a Diasonics DRF 400 and penile artery measurements were taken before and after the intracorporeal injection of papaverine hydrochloride. The penile/brachial index was measured in 82 patients and its predictive value compared with the results of duplex scanning and papaverine-induced erection. On scanning evidence of good arterial inflow but poor erections, indirect evidence of venous leakage was assumed. The results showed that the deep artery responses best characterised the erectile response, with the dorsal artery being less helpful. All 37 patients with full erections following papaverine exhibited bilateral deep artery peak velocities of greater than or equal to 25 cm/s. Of the remaining 109 sub-optimal responders, 17 also has this finding; all had undergone dynamic cavernosography, with 16 exhibiting venous leakage. The penile/brachial index was found to classify 13 patients incorrectly. A critical value of deep artery response to attain erection is postulated, enabling more logical use of cavernosography. The penile/brachial index was shown to be suspect and it was concluded that duplex scanning is a useful, non-invasive method in the assessment of impotence.\r"

In this randomized double-masked parallel clinical study, intraocular pressure (IOP) was successfully controlled in 78% of the patients who received levobunolol and 89% of those who received timolol.

In both groups the overall mean IOP during treatment was significantly lower than the pretreatment value (p less than 0.001).

Food remains the \"drug\" of choice. Antidepressants have been found to be beneficial in the treatment of BN. The meaning of this in the context of a relation between BN and mood disorders remains unclear, since coexistent depression does not predict a positive response to these drugs. Pharmacotherapy represents a single but important dimension of the management of patients with eating disorders.

  ".W": "We support the concept of a common anatomic and physiologic link between the acute coronary syndromes, which consists of plaque fissuring or rupture, leading to exposure of the circulating blood to collagen, lipids, and smooth muscle cells. This, in turn, results in marked platelet activation and the initiation of the coagulation sequence, both of which lead to thrombus formation. What determines the clinical outcome in these patients is the suddenness of coronary occlusion, the completeness of blood flow deprivation, and most importantly, its duration. In unstable angina, either plaque disruption resulting in an abrupt change in its morphologic configuration with reduction of coronary blood flow or increased myocardial oxygen demand are associated with increased exertional symptoms. In rest angina, two events may take place: formation of a transient and labile thrombus due to platelet and clotting activation, or vasospasm associated with the release of platelet-derived vasoconstrictive substances or loss of endothelial relaxing properties. As a result, transient myocardial ischemia occurs, which may be intermittent and recurrent and may progress to myocardial infarction or sudden death. In myocardial infarction, plaque rupture is usually more severe, leading to the formation of an occlusive or near-occlusive thrombus which may be more persistent and fixed to the arterial wall. The duration of coronary blood flow deprivation needs to be sufficiently long in order to produce myocardial cell death. Moreover, the difference between Q-wave and non-Q-wave infarction is probably determined by the duration of blood flow obstruction, being longer in the former. The presence of a functionally adequate collateral circulation will, in part, determine the survival of the area of myocardium at jeopardy. The coronary events that take place in ischemic sudden death are probably similar to those in unstable angina, namely plaque rupture with thrombus formation. In sudden death, the resulting myocardial ischemia may precipitate fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Alternatively, platelet microemboli from ulcerated arterial plaques may produce multiple areas of myocardial necrosis which can result in electrical instability and ventricular fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "Large multicenter trials have shown an improvement in both survival and left ventricular function in patients undergoing reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The most practical approach in treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction involves intravenous administration of effective thrombolytic agents as soon as possible in the course of myocardial infarction. This approach using r-tPA results in reperfusion in approximately two-thirds of patients. In patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy and extensive injury current or hemodynamic compromise, emergent cardiac catheterization should be performed followed by immediate PTCA or bypass surgery. In patients who have already been treated with thrombolytic agents, controversy exists as to the optimal timing of cardiac catheterization to define coronary anatomy and the need for additional revascularization. We suggest that the most beneficial therapeutic strategy for the majority of patients is rapid administration of an effective intravenous thrombolytic agent combined with aspirin and heparin. Cardiac catheterization and PTCA or coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be deferred in stable patients. This approach is supported by evidence showing a lack of additional improvement in mortality and left ventricular function in patients treated with urgent PTCA. The advent of new therapeutic modalities in acute myocardial infarction, such as thrombolysis, has created a new subset of patients who either will have an improved prognosis if coronary artery reperfusion is completed or will have an increased risk for recurrent myocardial ischemia if definite revascularization is delayed.\r"

For the long-term, beta-blockers represent the only documented effective prophylactic treatment for MI patients. The reduction in all-cause mortality is due primarily to a reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular deaths, particularly sudden cardiac deaths. This finding is consistent with the experimental observation that beta-blockers raise the threshold for ventricular fibrillation. Indeed, MI patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias respond very favorably to beta-blockers. However, reductions in nonsudden deaths and nonfatal reinfarctions have also been observed, suggesting that the beneficial effects of beta-blockers are not limited to antiarrhythmic effects alone and that these drugs may also have anti-ischemic effects. The prime candidates for beta-blocker therapy are the high-risk MI patients with transient electrical and/or pump complications during the acute phase. If therapy is initiated within hours of an acute infarction, it seems reasonable to continue it after hospital discharge. Evidence from the large, long-term trials suggest that, in the absence of any troublesome adverse reaction and given that most post-MI patients experience ventricular arrhythmias and angina, it seems reasonable not to limit the duration of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In medicine and in cardiology one must be aware that there is no \"standard\" management for any condition. However, some guidelines can be offered for the management of myocardial infarction in the early stages. The following can be considered an aggressive but stepwise approach to therapy of patients with suspected myocardial infarction using conventional drugs with or without thrombolytic therapy or coronary angioplasty. Any patient presenting with prolonged chest pain occurring at rest should have an electrocardiogram. If the ECG is abnormal, an evolving myocardial infarction can be suspected. In this setting, oxygen should be administered if the patient is dyspneic, cyanotic, or has rales in the chest, intravenous nitroglycerin should be given, and the patient's response should be assessed. Caution should be observed at this point if the patient is sweating or hypotensive. Administration of a vasodilator in a dehydrated patient may drop the blood pressure further. If pain is relieved and the ECG returns to normal, the working diagnosis is severe angina. However, acute myocardial infarction should not be dismissed. A strong case for the use of intravenous heparin can be made to prevent the redevelopment of intracoronary clot inasmuch as thrombosis probably occurs in most patients presenting with unstable and severe angina, as it most surely does in patients with an evolving acute myocardial infarction. If nitrates and oxygen relieve chest pain but the ECG remains abnormal, for example, ST segment elevation, the diagnosis of acute evolving myocardial infarction must be considered and intravenous nitrates should be continued. If the patient has no relief of pain from nitrates and oxygen and the ECG remains abnormal, morphine sulfate should be administered intravenously in sufficient dosage to relieve the chest pain but not produce hypotension or hypoventilation. Once the diagnosis of myocardial infarction has been made, some would begin administering intravenous lidocaine as prophylaxis against the ventricular arrhythmias commonly encountered in the earlier stages of myocardial infarction. It has not been my practice to use prophylactic lidocaine, but I believe it is prudent to have a low threshold for the use of this drug in patients with frequent PVCs, especially if they are multifocal. If the patient exhibits symptomatic bradycardia or heart block, a trial with intravenous atropine is warranted. Additionally, while all of this is going on, one should contemplate using beta-blockers if there is good indication, and thrombolytic therapy if there are no contraindications to its use.\r"

They offer the hope of significantly ameliorating the morbidity and mortality associated with these arrhythmias. Although arrhythmias and disturbances of conduction are among the most important and potentially lethal consequences of myocardial infarction, advances in evaluation and management of these problems have helped to improve prognosis for these patients. Greater long-term arrhythmia-free survival can be achieved when therapy is guided by programmed electrical stimulation. Pacemakers, newer antiarrhythmic drugs, the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, catheter ablation, and surgery are all important tools in the management of ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden death.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that there is up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor density or supersensitivity of beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the denervated transplanted human heart, we studied myocardium from transplanted, normal, and failing hearts. Myocardium was obtained from 10 patients 9 +/- 3 months after cardiac transplantation, from 10 patients without cardiac disease, and from eight patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure due to idiopathic cardiomyopathy. beta-Adrenergic receptor density in transplanted myocardium (15 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, 1.20 +/- 0.14 fmol/mg DNA) was not different from that in normal myocardium (22 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, 1.46 +/- 0.13 fmol/mg DNA; p = NS for both). In myocardium from cardiomyopathic hearts, beta-adrenergic receptor density was markedly reduced (8 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein, 0.84 +/- 0.13 fmol/mg DNA; p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 vs. normal myocardium, respectively). Likewise, the response of adenylate cyclase to isoproterenol in transplanted myocardium was not significantly different from that in normal myocardium, but the response was markedly depressed in cardiomyopathic myocardium. Although forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was similar in all three groups, guanine nucleotide-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was markedly reduced in transplanted myocardium (20 +/- 17 vs. 78 +/- 13 pmol/mg/min for normal myocardium, p less than 0.01) and to a lesser degree in cardiomyopathic myocardium (39 +/- 14 pmol/mg/min, p less than 0.03 vs. normal myocardium). Thus, there is no evidence of beta-adrenergic receptor up-regulation or supersensitivity in denervated transplanted human myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the long term, numerous new techniques for studying pathophysiology at the subcellular and molecular levels will demand a central role for endomyocardial biopsy in the diagnosis, treatment and fundamental understanding of myocardial diseases. We believe that endomyocardial biopsy will serve as an indispensible link between basic scientists and clinicians in the effort to describe disease mechanisms.\r"

Based on glucose tolerance as assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), glucose tolerance was normal in 5 (group U:N), borderline in 5 (group U:BL) and decreased in 9 uremic subjects (group U:D). Compared with group A the uremics demonstrated significantly (p less than 0.01) impaired insulin sensitivity as assessed by a continuous mixed infusion of somatostatin, insulin and glucose (SIGIT). In addition 19 non-diabetic subjects with normal fasting blood glucose and normal renal function, matching the uremic patients with respect to glucose tolerance as assessed by OGTT, were studied (group B). In group B impairments in both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity tended to be more pronounced in subjects with decreased OGTT as compared with those with borderline OGTT. In contrast, insulin resistance was present to a similar degree in uremic subjects of group U:N, U:BL and U:D. During SIGIT endogenous insulin, glucagon and growth hormone (GH) were suppressed in both uremic and control subjects. This implies that insulin resistance in uremia is most likely not due to hyperglucagonemia or abnormal GH metabolism. During OGTT subjects of group U:N had significantly higher insulin response than subjects of group U:BL (p less than 0.02) and group U:D (p less than 0.01). Insulinogenic index was significantly higher in group U:N than in group U:BL (p less than 0.02) and group U:D (p = 0.01) and was higher in group U:BL than in group U:D (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. We have investigated the effects of the non-renin-mediated actions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the progression of chronic renal failure accelerated by hypertension. For this purpose, we studied the effects of captopril (a thiol-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), enalapril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor without a thiol group) and cysteine (a thiol-containing amino acid which has no angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory action) in adriamycin-treated rats with deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension, in which the renin-angiotensin system was suppressed. 2. There were no significant differences in blood pressure between these groups and the control group [adriamycin-treated group with deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt loading, 206 +/- 7 mmHg (27.4 +/- 0.9 kPa) at week 10]. 3. Massive proteinuria occurred in all groups. At the end of the experiment (at week 10), urinary protein excretion was significantly reduced in the captopril and cysteine groups compared with the control group. No manifest improvements appeared in the enalapril group. 4. Levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen increased progressively. At week 10, the increases in the serum levels of creatinine were less in the captopril (87 +/- 16 mmol/l) and cysteine (80 +/- 19 mmol/l) groups than in the control group (124 +/- 27 mmol/l) (P less than 0.01). No marked differences were found between the control and enalapril groups. 5. Captopril and cysteine caused more than a three-fold reduction in the focal glomerulosclerosis score when compared with that in the control group, but enalapril did not decrease the score. The extent of tubulointerstitial change was parallel with the focal glomerulosclerosis score. 6. We conclude that the thiol group is possibly involved in the mechanism of the beneficial effects of some angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the progression of chronic renal failure exacerbated by hypertension.\r"

In order to examine the handling of sodium by the nephrotic kidney when separated from the immediate influences of renal nerves and humoral factors, kidneys were taken from nephrotic rats (puromycin aminonucleoside) and studied over a range of perfusion pressures using the isolated perfused kidney technique. 2. When perfused with medium containing 6.7 g/dl albumin, the nephrotic kidneys performed differently from controls with a reduction in sodium excretion at all pressures [(mean +/- SEM) 1.14 +/- 0.43 vs 4.20 +/- 0.69 mumol/min at 105 mmHg (14 kPa); 6.32 +/- 1.56 vs 44.60 +/- 5.30 mumol/min at 150 mmHg (20 kPa)]. Renal vascular resistance, inulin clearance, fractional sodium excretion and fractional lithium excretion were also reduced. 3. When kidneys were perfused without oncotic agent these differences between nephrotic and control kidneys remained. Perfusion with medium containing 10 g/dl albumin, designed to prevent glomerular filtration, abolished the difference in vascular resistance between the two groups. Captopril had no effect on the sodium retention or vascular resistance of nephrotic kidneys. 4. It was concluded that (a) the isolated nephrotic kidney demonstrates increased avidity for sodium, (b) the abnormality of sodium handling is not dependent on the presence of altered oncotic forces, and (c) the alteration in vascular resistance is conditional upon glomerular filtration.\r"

Removal of the submandibular glands did not affect the high plasma concentration of inactive renin in male mice. 3. Inactive plasma renin decreased over several days after castration of normal and sialoadenectomized male mice to the same levels as those found in normal female mice. 4. Treatment of these castrated male mice with testosterone increased and normalized inactive plasma renin independently of whether the submandibular glands had been previously removed or not. 5. Testosterone treatment of sialoadenectomized female mice increased inactive renin to the same levels as those found in normal male mice. 6. Our findings suggest that the sex difference in inactive plasma renin in mice may be explained by an increased secretion of inactive renin in male mice stimulated by androgens. 7. Since we have recently found that inactive plasma renin in male mice is mainly of renal origin, this increased secretion is most likely located to the kidneys.\r"

Ten dogs having combined anastomosis were compared with ten dogs having a two-layer sutured anastomosis in the rectum as a control. The median bursting strength in the rectum seven days after the operation was 280 mm Hg (range, 180 to 340 mm Hg) for the combined anastomosis and 260 mm Hg (range, 170 to 405 mm Hg) for the sutured anastomosis in the control group.

Delay in gastric emptying was evidenced in 59% of the dyspeptic patients; it occurred with liquids in more cases than solids. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of symptoms was of no practical value in predicting the presence of objective stasis. The dyspeptic patients were included in a double-blind randomized controlled trial of cisapride, a new gastrokinetic drug devoid of central antiemetic effects. After six weeks of cisapride treatment, all patients with initially abnormal gastric emptying rates for liquids, and all but one for solids returned to normal ranges, and significant differences between cisapride and placebo groups were observed for half emptying times of both solids (136 +/- 16 min vs 227 +/- 32 min; P less than 0.02) and liquids (61 +/- 4 min vs 132 +/- 37 min; P less than 0.01). Cisapride also significantly improved dyspeptic symptom scores at weeks 3 and 6 of treatment as compared to those measured before treatment. Nevertheless, the decrease in global diary score was significantly higher than that seen with placebo at week 3 (-16 +/- 6 vs -1 +/- 9; P less than 0.05), but not at week 6 (-18 +/- 5 vs -10 +/- 8).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

High levels of chemotactic activity were seen at 3 hr of incubation. Antral and fundic tissue were equally capable of producing neutrophil chemotactic activity. In addition, high levels of activity were seen from both the serosal and mucosal surfaces. Initial biochemical characterization of these gastric-derived factors revealed that: (1) a majority of the activity (80-90%) exhibited molecular weight values of greater than 300 kDa, (2) the chemotactic activity was heat stable but was partially reduced by treatment with a protease, subtilisin (37% inhibition), and (3) 70-80% of the activity in the supernatants was extracted into organic solvent (ethyl acetate). These factors may prove to be important in recruitment of neutrophils to areas of gastric injury.\r"

To promote a greater awareness of the importance of this problem, we have reviewed the literature, particularly in regard to the mechanisms of action and the clinical and therapeutic implications of these chemical injuries to the esophagus. There can be no doubt that the frequency of occurrence of drug-induced esophageal ulceration far exceeds that reflected in the reported cases appearing in the medical literature. Nor can we deny that much of the responsibility for this situation lies in the failure of the prescribing physician to educate his patients (and himself!) in the art of taking potentially harmful pills and capsules, particularly tetracycline, doxycycline, potassium chloride, and quinidine preparations. Although most such drug injuries are self-limited events, there have been a number of fatalities reported and at the very least they involve acute discomfort.\r"

All groups had increased CF-SG compared with controls. Postural blood pressure and simultaneous CF-SG antibody measurements were performed in 28 IDDM subjects. The drop in systolic blood pressure was greater in the CF-SG+ subjects (P less than .05), and the frequency of CF-SG was greater in the mean to -2SD group (P less than .03) when data were analyzed within mean +/- 2SD of the normal blood pressure response.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of mild hypoglycemia on psychomotor performance and counterregulatory responses was studied among 12 healthy volunteers. Each volunteer received two modified hyperinsulinemic glucose clamps. One morning, plasma glucose was held constant at euglycemic levels (4.9 mM) for 95 min, and another morning, it was lowered over 35 min and then held constant at hypoglycemic levels (3.4 mM) for 60 min. A battery of psychomotor tests and a questionnaire assessing hypoglycemic symptoms were administered before and repeated during the last 30 min of each clamp. The questionnaire and three selected psychomotor tests were also administered repetitively during the 1st h of each clamp. During the hypoglycemic studies, a rise was seen in plasma epinephrine and pancreatic polypeptide at 45 min. An increase in symptom scores was first recorded at 50 min during the hypoglycemic studies [median 4 (range 0-13) vs. 2 (5-6), P less than .05]. Performance was impaired on two psychomotor tests included in the battery. One was the trail making test on fine motor performance (-19.3 +/- 4.2 targets/min, mean +/- SE vs. 1.2 +/- 4.8 targets/min, P less than .05), and the other was the digit-symbol substitution (DSS) test on information processing and memory (18 +/- 3 vs. 29 +/- 4 symbols/min, P less than .03). Of the tests administered during the 1st h, performance was impaired on the DSS. This impairment became significant at 45 min (14 +/- 4 vs. 22 +/- 4 symbols/min, P less than .005). In conclusion, mild hypoglycemia selectively impairs psychomotor performance in healthy volunteers but not before the onset of glucose counterregulation and warning symptoms.\r"

Because many of these patients are overweight and sedentary, such low-intensity activity would appear most appropriate, especially during initial intervention. However, there has been little research on the effects of low-intensity life-style activity on glycemic control. This study examined the effects of varying the duration (0, 20, or 40 min) of low-intensity exercise (50-55% of age-predicted max heart rate) on glycemic responses during exercise and a subsequent meal in type II diabetic patients. Glycemic response to exercise was significantly related to the duration of activity; 20 min of activity decreased blood glucose (BG) by 6 mg/dl, whereas 40 min decreased BG by 16 mg/dl. The effect of exercise on glucose was maintained over a 30-min rest period but disappeared after a meal was consumed. Insulin and the insulin-to-glucose ratio were not affected by the length of activity. These data suggest that life-style activity of long duration (20-40 min) produces a significant, but modest, decrease in glucose levels in type II diabetic women.\r"

Most Americans eat and enjoy sugar-containing foods every day, but the use of sugars in the diabetic diet has traditionally been proscribed for fear of aggravating hyperglycemia. However, short-term and most longer-term studies demonstrate that dietary sucrose does not cause a greater postprandial rise in plasma glucose than isocaloric amounts of other common carbohydrates. The available evidence suggests that sucrose has a glycemic effect similar to that of bread, potatoes, and rice. Dietary fructose, in contrast, may produce a lesser postprandial rise in plasma glucose than other common carbohydrates. There is considerable controversy about the effects of dietary sucrose and fructose on serum lipids, and their effects on other metabolic events, such as the nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins, are uncertain. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to allow diabetic patients to consume sugar-containing foods as long as they do so in a controlled fashion.\r"

However, there is evidence from several well-controlled prospective studies demonstrating that the consumption of moderate amounts of sucrose may result in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The fact that not all studies demonstrate these deleterious effects does not negate the positive data. The magnitude of the deleterious effects will probably vary with individual patients, baseline status, and amount of sucrose. Because these metabolic abnormalities are most disturbed in diabetes and are associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease, it would seem reasonable to continue to advise patients with NIDDM to limit sucrose consumption, at least until available data would allow us to predict in which individuals and at what level of sucrose consumption these adverse metabolic effects would not be present.\r"

The subjects were recruited from 2858 NIDDM patients screened for ICA between 1980 and 1984. In male NIDDM subjects, CPR levels to OGTT decreased insidiously, and 8 of 15 men developed the insulin-dependent state with abolished CPR. Only 2 female NIDDM subjects progressed to the insulin-dependent state (P less than .05, women vs. men). Thus, CPR in female subjects tended to decrease less than in male subjects. There were no significant differences between the two groups in human leukocyte antigens (HLA) or titer of ICA during the follow-up period. These results suggest that maleness is a major risk factor for slowly progressive beta-cell dysfunction in adult-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).\r"

Accurate clinical assessment from the history and physical examination is very important to assess the severity of the disease. Some measure of airway resistance of either FEV1 or PEFR should be done in every patient initially, at repeated intervals, and at discharge, to have a parameter to follow in therapy as well as a tool to use to warn the physician of a severe amount of airway obstruction. The inhaled beta agonists are the first line of therapy in acute asthma and can be delivered by either the nebulizer or the MDI with or without a spacer. Aminophylline will be continued to be used acutely even though it appears there is no improvement in bronchospasm in the first few hours of treatment when aminophylline is added to therapy. Anticholinergic agents will gain a wider role in acute asthma, especially when used in combination with a beta agonist. Corticosteroids continue to have a role in severe attacks of asthma, and earlier use may prevent relapse. Fatal asthma still occurs, however, and the emergency physician must use strict criteria to recognize status asthmaticus or the patient who is not doing well and admit them to the hospital. Using a stepwise, logical approach to the treatment of the asthmatic patient will lead to better patient satisfaction and fewer errors on part of the emergency physician.\r"

Anaerobic cavitary disease is typically an indolent process, whereas necrotizing pneumonia is more fulminant and deadly. Rarely are aggressive diagnostic measures necessary in the community-acquired setting. Most patients, even with necrotizing pneumonia, respond well to high-dose penicillin and show clinical improvement within a week to 10 days. Clindamycin may be preferred in cases of severe underlying disease or when penicillin fails to yield signs of recovery. The presence of empyema not only increases the duration of therapy but also is fraught with complications and carries a higher mortality rate (20 vs 5 per cent). Necrotizing pneumonia and pulmonary abscess that develop in the nursing home or hospital setting require a more aggressive diagnostic approach, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is necessary. In spite of these measures and appropriate antibiotic selection, nosocomial-acquired disease carries a mortality rate of 30 to 50 per cent. Surgical intervention, once the mainstay of therapy, is now reserved for patients with complications such as massive hemoptysis, failure to respond to chest tube thoracostomy in the presence of empyema, abscess drainage that fails with postural drainage, and diagnosis of carcinoma.\r"

The other large group of pneumothoraces will be spontaneous but secondary to a disease process, procedure, or drug abuse. The treatment of these must be individualized because conservative measures may not work and the underlying process may require attention as well. Although gaining in popularity, the use of devices or procedures other than formal chest tubes is still not general practice. The major complication of pneumothorax is tension pneumothorax, which is rapidly fatal and must be excluded immediately in all patients regardless of the etiology. Treatment of this complication must be carried out without delay for further diagnostic studies by venting the chest. The significance of pleural effusion depends on its volume and composition. If the cause is not known with certainty or if the patient is dyspneic, thoracentesis should be performed. The fluid is sent for numerous tests including specific gravity, pH, glucose, LDH, and protein. On this basis it is determined as either transudate, which tends to be associated with more benign disorders, or exudate, which is seen with infection, malignancy, and numerous other processes. In all cases the underlying disease requires therapy but only certain exudates require aggressive treatment primarily. Many parapneumonic effusions and all empyemas are exudates that require tube thoracostomy.\r"

  ".W": "The potential role of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention of atherosclerotic disease in the nondiabetic population currently engenders interest, enthusiasm, and controversy. Some apparently beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on platelet function, eicosanoid formation, plasma triglyceride levels, and blood pressure have been described in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, enthusiasm for the use of omega-3 fatty acids in diabetes has been dampened by reports of potentially deleterious effects of these agents, including increased plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and serum apolipoprotein B levels. These adverse effects have been achieved with large, perhaps excessive, doses of omega-3 fatty acids, in the range of 4-10 g/day. The magnitude of these adverse effects has been small (typically 10-36%). It cannot be assumed that the effects of omega-3 fatty acids are the same in patients with diabetes mellitus as in nondiabetic subjects or patients with primary hyperlipidemia. First, the biosynthesis and composition of fatty acids is abnormal in diabetic animals and possibly in diabetic patients. Second, many potential mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis are present in diabetic but not necessarily in nondiabetic subjects. Third, the mechanisms of many of the risk factors in diabetic patients differ from the mechanisms of these abnormalities in nondiabetic subjects, reflecting the effects of insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and their sequelae. Finally, because diabetes is a heterogeneous group of diseases, the effects of omega-3 fatty acids must be addressed separately for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and possibly other forms of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To study the presence of the protein kinase mediating this phosphorylation, soluble extracts of intact acini that had been previously treated with insulin were prepared and assayed for protein kinase activity with rat pancreatic ribosomes as a substrate. Activation of S6 kinase activity, observed in a time-dependent manner, was maximal after 20-30 min and, in a dose-dependent manner, was half-maximal at 1 nM and maximal at 10 nM insulin concentration. Based on cofactor requirements, substrate specificity, and a slow activation of the enzyme, the S6 kinase was distinct from cAMP-dependent, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent, and Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinases and protease-activated kinase II. The S6 kinase activated by insulin was highly specific for the ribosomal protein S6 when compared with various substrates, including casein, glycogen synthase, phosphorylase b, phosvitin, histone HIII-S, and histone HVIII-S. Protein S6 phosphorylation in intact acini and activation of the S6 kinase by insulin showed similar dose-response curves, consistent with the S6 kinase being responsible for the protein S6 phosphorylation in intact acini. The comparison of the dose-response curves for S6 phosphorylation and protein synthesis in acini suggests that there is a close correlation between these two insulin actions.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive hepatic glucose output is an important factor in the fasting hyperglycemia of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). To determine the relative contributions of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in a quantitative manner, we applied a new isotopic approach, using infusions of [6-3H]glucose and [2-14C]acetate to trace overall hepatic glucose output and phosphoenolpyruvate gluconeogenesis in 14 postabsorptive NIDDM subjects and in 9 nondiabetic volunteers of similar age and weight. Overall hepatic glucose output was increased nearly twofold in the NIDDM subjects (22.7 +/- 1.0 vs. 12.0 +/- 0.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1 in the nondiabetic volunteers, P less than .001); phosphoenolpyruvate gluconeogenesis was increased more than threefold in the NIDDM subjects (12.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.4 mumol.kg-1.min-1 in the nondiabetic subjects, P less than .001) and was accompanied by increased plasma lactate, alanine, and glucagon concentrations (all P less than .05). The increased phosphoenolpyruvate gluconeogenesis accounted for 89 +/- 6% of the increase in overall hepatic glucose output in the NIDDM subjects and was significantly correlated with the fasting plasma glucose concentrations (r = .67, P less than .01). Glycogenolysis, calculated as the difference between overall hepatic glucose output and phosphoenolpyruvate gluconeogenesis, was not significantly different in the NIDDM subjects (9.9 +/- 0.06 mumol.kg-1.min-1) and the nondiabetic volunteers (8.4 +/- 0.3 mumol.kg-1.min-1). We conclude that increased gluconeogenesis is the predominant mechanism responsible for increased hepatic glucose output in NIDDM.\r"

The possibility that autoimmune-related diabetes can be treated with CCA warrants further attention.\r"

Insulin sensitivity was measured with Bergman's minimal model. Islet function was evaluated by measurement of acute insulin (AIR) and glucagon (AGR) responses to arginine at three glucose levels. Insulin resistance was demonstrated and quantified by a marked drop in the insulin sensitivity index (Sl) from 6.72 +/- 0.77 to 2.47 +/- 0.36 x 10(-5) min-1/pM (P less than .0001) and resulted in a doubling of basal immunoreactive insulin levels (from 75 +/- 7 to 157 +/- 21 pM, P less than .001) with no change in fasting glucose (5.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 5.7 +/- 0.1 mM).

To find which of the fetal tissues accounts for such an increase in fetal O2 use, we examined the effect of plasma hyperinsulinemia on O2, glucose, and lactate use by the hindquarters of 13 fetal sheep. Spinal anesthesia was used for the ewes, and local anesthesia was used for the fetuses during placement of catheters. The ewes then recovered for 5 days. After 18 h of insulin infusion, blood samples were drawn, and microspheres were injected to measure blood flow to the tissues of the hindquarters. Three to five infusions of various insulin concentrations in each fetus were followed by blood sampling and blood-flow measurements. Fetal hyperinsulinemia (less than or equal to 437 pM) increased blood flow to and O2 use by the hindquarters of the fetal sheep but did not affect the glucose-O2 quotients of these tissues. Consequently, glucose use increased proportionately to the increased O2 use. Lactate production was not affected by insulin. We conclude that increased O2 use by all the nonvisceral fetal tissues accounted for the increased O2 use of the entire fetus reported during fetal hyperinsulinemia and, consequently, for the fetal arterial hypoxemia associated with fetal hyperinsulinemia. If the hyperinsulinemic human fetus (such as the infant of the diabetic mother) also increases O2 use in nonvisceral tissue, such an increase might contribute to the susceptibility of the infants to late intrauterine fetal death, polycythemia, and hyperbilirubinemia, all of which may be consequences of intrauterine arterial hypoxemia.\r"

To assess whether the action of insulin on cholesterol esterification by intestinal cells is direct or mediated by other effectors associated with diabetes, we investigated the effect of insulin on the activity of microsomal acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and on the incorporation rate of [14C]oleic acid into cholesteryl oleate in the Caco-2 human intestinal cell line. Microsomal ACAT activity of cells that were incubated with insulin for 3 h at a concentration of 1, 10, and 100 microU/ml was decreased by 48, 58, and 74%, respectively, compared with cells cultured in insulinfree medium. This effect was evident as soon as 10 min after the addition of 10 microU/ml insulin. The inhibition by insulin was reversible. After incubation for 24 h, intracellular esterified-cholesterol content and the ratio of esterified to nonesterified cholesterol were significantly lower in the cells treated with insulin (100 microU/ml) than in those not treated with insulin (esterified cholesterol 48.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 74.2 +/- 4.3 nmol/mg protein, respectively, P less than .005; esterified to nonesterified ratio 0.280 +/- 0.008 vs. 0.359 +/- 0.059, respectively, P less than .05). Cells cultured on filters manifested physiologic polarity; greater than 90% of [14C]oleic acid-labeled cholesterol ester secreted by cells was secreted into the basolateral chambers. Incorporation of [14C]oleic acid into cholesteryl oleate over 24 h in the cells and in the medium of the basolateral chamber was suppressed by 100 microU/ml insulin by 23 and 40%, respectively. These findings indicate that insulin acts directly on the enterocytes to suppress intestinal cholesterol ester synthesis and secretion.\r"

This assessment was based on a comparison of results in rats given streptozocin (STZ) on day of birth (n0-STZ), when 2 days old (n2-STZ), or when 5 days old (n5-STZ). At 10 wk of age, the n2-STZ rats exhibited characteristics similar to those obtained in the n0-STZ rats: normal growth, modest elevation of basal plasma glucose (8.23 +/- 0.24 mM), glucose intolerance, depleted pancreatic insulin stores (approximately 50% of normal value), and lack of insulin release in response to glucose in vivo. In contrast, the n5-STZ rats exhibited frank basal hyperglycemia (glucose 11.9 +/- 1.1 mM) and glucose intolerance, increased glycosylated hemoglobins, strong reduction of the pancreatic insulin stores (10% of normal value), decreased basal plasma insulin levels (50% of normal value), and lack of insulin release in response to glucose in vivo. Changes in the sensitivity of the neonatal beta-cell to STZ and the regeneration capacity of the beta-cells during the 1st postnatal wk were liable factors for the contrast. In vivo insulin action was assessed with the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique in 10-wk-old anesthetized animals. In the n2-STZ rats compared with controls 1) endogenous glucose production was significantly higher despite a normal plasma insulin level in the basal state, 2) endogenous glucose production rate was similarly suppressed by hyperinsulinemia, and 3) glucose utilization by the whole-body mass was similarly increased by hyperglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used the plasma [13C]-alpha-ketoisocaproate (representing intracellular leucine labeling) as the precursor pool of protein synthesis for our calculations. FMPS during the insulin treatment (0.0472 +/- 0.0046%/h; plasma glucose 4.6 +/- 1.0 mM) was not different from FMPS during insulin deprivation (0.0499 +/- 0.0046%/h; plasma glucose 16.4 +/- 0.5 mM). Using plasma [13C]-alpha-ketoisocaproate at isotopic plateau for calculation of leucine flux and as the precursor for leucine oxidation, we further confirmed the findings of our group and others that insulin treatment decreases leucine flux, leucine oxidation, and the nonoxidative portion of leucine flux. Our data on direct measurement of FMPS provide further evidence that the anabolic effect of insulin in the postabsorptive type I diabetic patient is mediated via reduction of proteolysis rather than by increasing protein synthesis.\r"

A biphasic pattern of insulin secretion was observed when cells were stimulated with a constant glucose concentration as low as 0.28 mM, with increasing stimulation at 0.56, 1.7, and 5.6 mM glucose. Higher glucose concentrations did not increase insulin secretion. In the absence of glucose, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (15, 30, and 50 microM), which blocks the reacylation of lysophospholipids with arachidonic acid, also evoked a concentration-dependent biphasic release of insulin. Lysophosphatidylcholine (50, 75, and 100 micrograms/ml) also caused a concentration-dependent biphasic release of insulin in the absence of glucose. These observations were similar to those previously reported for superfused monolayer culture of rat islet cells and suggest that the HIT cell is a beta-cell line that may be valuable in the further examination of the relationships among glucose, phospholipid metabolism, and insulin secretion. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that glucose-stimulated release of lysophospholipids may be important in initiation of the biphasic pattern of glucose-stimulated insulin release.\r"

Furthermore, lymphocytes from diabetic patients displayed a highly correlated (r = .97, P less than .001) binding on two different xenogeneic beta-cell lines (RIN and hamster insulinoma HIT cells). This phenomenon was not found on a panel of seven non-beta-cell lines (e.g., exocrine pancreatic cells, endocrine cells). By increasing lymphocyte-to-RIN ratios (0.25:1 to 30:1), the supernumerary RIN-adherent lymphocytes from diabetic patients, expressed as the percentage of lymphocytes involved conjugates, were only detectable at lower ratios (0.25:1 to 4:1), and their binding efficiency was two times higher than that of control lymphocytes. This efficiency fell at higher ratios (greater than 4:1) to the level of background rosettes that remained constant through the ratio scale. This specific RIN-rosette formation was abrogated when lymphocytes from diabetic patients were preabsorbed on beta-cells (either HIT or RIN) but not on non-beta-cells, whereas preabsorption of control lymphocytes did not modify the number of background rosettes. In addition, diabetic rosettes, but not background rosettes, were inhibited by competition with RIN membrane extracts but not by non-beta-cell extracts. Moreover, diabetic rosettes were inhibited during blocking experiments with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) but not with unrelated MoAbs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Many viral infections induce interferon (IFN) production and cause insulin resistance. To examine the causal relationship between IFN and insulin resistance, we injected natural human leukocyte IFN-alpha (3 x 10(6) IU, i.m.) twice overnight in eight healthy subjects and determined oral (OGT) and intravenous (IVGT) glucose tolerance and sensitivity to insulin (287 nmol or 40 mU.m-2.min-1 euglycemic insulin clamp) the following morning. IFN caused mild influenzalike symptoms and induced a rise in circulating glucose, insulin, hydrocortisone (cortisol), growth hormone, and glucagon concentrations (P less than .05-.001). In the OGT test, the area under the glucose curve was 2.6-fold greater (P less than .02), and the disappearance rate of intravenously administered glucose was reduced by 28% (P less than .05) after IFN administration. The impairment in OGT and IVGT occurred despite augmented insulin response. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was reduced by 22% (P less than .005), and insulin clearance increased by 18% (P less than .02) after IFN administration. When the insulin-clamp study was repeated in patients with steady-state hyperinsulinemia that was 12% higher (P less than .005) after IFN, the glucose disposal rate was still reduced by 15% (P less than .01). These data indicate that IFN 1) stimulates counterregulatory hormone secretion, 2) impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and 3) stimulates insulin clearance. Thus, IFN may be involved in the development of insulin resistance during viral infections.\r"

To define the impact of lithium ion on in vivo glucose metabolism, the effect of 2 wk of lithium treatment on plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, insulin-mediated glucose disposal, and skeletal muscle glycogen synthesis in normal and diabetic rats was examined. Our results demonstrated the ability of lithium ions to completely restore insulin sensitivity to normal in diabetic rats. The insulin-mimetic activity of the cation seems to be highly specific for the glycogenic pathway in skeletal muscle. These results raise the possibility that lithium ion may prove effective in reversing the defect in glycogen storage that characterizes non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty Black families in which at least two siblings had non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were typed for restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms at the insulin (INS), insulin-receptor (INSR), and HLA-DR beta loci. Evidence for linkage between NIDDM and these loci was assessed with various genetic models for the transmission of NIDDM and with the affected-sib-pair approach, which does not require assumptions concerning a genetic model for NIDDM. Tight linkage between NIDDM and any of the loci was unlikely under all of the genetic models examined. Similarly, for all three of the loci, the distribution of affected sib pairs sharing 2, 1, or 0 genes identical by descent was not significantly different from (and was very similar to) that expected if the locus were unrelated to disease susceptibility. There was no evidence for linkage heterogeneity for any of the loci when families were grouped according to obesity or age at onset or when considering families individually. We conclude that the INS and INSR loci can be ruled out as major susceptibility loci for NIDDM in most Black families segregating this disorder, but we recognize that defects at either of these loci may cause or contribute to NIDDM in some patients. In addition, it is possible that variation at the INS and/or INSR loci may contribute to NIDDM susceptibility by modifying susceptibility due primarily to another major gene(s) or as part of an overall polygenic component to NIDDM.\r"

Twelve percent of the control serums from healthy individuals bound to carcinoid cells, and 2% bound to islet cells. Seventy-five percent of the children with newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had carcinoid tumor antibodies, and 83% had islet cell antibodies. These findings suggest that antigenic determinants are shared between endocrine cells of islets of Langerhans and neuroendocrine tumors of the same embryological derivation. Carcinoid tumors may not only provide an alternative source for islet cell antibody assays but also supply material for isolation of antigens possibly involved in the immunopathogenesis of diabetes.\r"

Aspects of telephone consultations examined include the quality of care, the effectiveness of training programmes and the role of other health professionals. Important gaps in the literature are identified, including the lack of comparisons between telephone and face-to-face care in terms of the quality of process and outcomes and the lack of data on costs and benefits.\r"

'Sickness certification' is defined, and related to the issues of 'absence from work' and 'sickness absence'. The use of measurements and results reported are emphasized according to patient- and doctor-related variables. Great variations are found, and some of the reasons may be differences in morbidity patterns, diagnostic procedures or sickness benefit acts. However, in studies from general practice, the number of sickness certificates is related to different denominators without describing the real population at risk, that is those of the patients who were employed or entitled to sickness benefits. Further studies are needed on the epidemiology of sickness certification, and the duration of the episodes. Analysis of the basis for the doctors' decisions, the patients' viewpoint, inter-doctor variations and doctors' attitudes should also be emphasized in the future. There is a need to discuss the reliability and validity of the measurements used, and theoretical considerations of the doctor's sickness certification practice are called for.\r"

The model of a Markov chain was used to compare their costs by a medical decision analysis. The high price of the initial procedure made proximal gastric vagotomy the most expensive therapy, its costs rising from +10,600 after 1 yr to +12,200 after 15 yr. The average costs of intermittent therapy per patient rose from +500 to +7500. Maintenance therapy cost as much as intermittent therapy but provided 8% and 4% more time spent free of ulcer relapse and pain, respectively. In a sensitivity analysis, the order of the therapeutic options regarding their cost-effectiveness remained robust to changes in the assumptions underlying the model. In a European health care system, the initial surgical procedure cost only one-seventh of the average annual income compared with two-thirds in the United States, and proximal gastric vagotomy turned out to be the cheapest therapy after 6 yr. These results suggest that maintenance therapy provides the best long-term management. Gastric surgery may represent a cost-effective measure of ulcer prevention in Europe but not in the United States.\r"

Endosonography was also more accurate than computed tomography in the assessment of regional lymph node metastases (overall accuracy: endosonography 80%, computed tomography 51%). The incidence of lymph node metastasis increased with the progression of the depth of tumor infiltration. The definitive exclusion factor for endosonography is severe stenosis, which cannot be passed with the instrument (26% of the cases). In these cases computed tomography was superior to endosonography in diagnosing celiac lymph node metastasis (overall accuracy: computed tomography 82%, endosonography 68%).\r"

One group of the recipient Gunn and analbuminemic rats were made genetically immunodeficient by interbreeding with athymic rats with inherited T-cell deficiency. Injected microcarriers and cells formed aggregates on the surface of the pancreas. There was no morphologic evidence of rejection in athymic recipients, whereas immunocompetent recipients demonstrated rejection within 5 days of transplantation. Athymic-Gunn rat recipients demonstrated excretion of bilirubin glucuronides in bile for 30 days and reduction in their serum bilirubin levels. In recipient athymic-analbuminemic rats, plasma albumin levels increased from pretransplantation levels of 0.025-0.05 mg/ml to 3.9-4.8 mg/ml 8 days posttransplantation and remained nearly at that level throughout the 30 days of the study. A method of harvesting, attaching to microcarriers, cryopreserving, and in vivo testing of human hepatocytes with prolonged survival and function in athymic-Gunn and athymic-analbuminemic hybrid rats is reported. These rats are excellent animal models for testing xenograft function.\r"

All patients were in Child's A class. Two-year survival (according to life-table analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method) was 50% in the first group and 39% in the second group. This difference was not significant. In the first group no relation was found between survival and initial tumor size or alpha-fetoprotein levels. Ultrasound examinations at 3-mo intervals revealed the following patterns of tumor growth: (a) no significant growth during the follow-up (9 patients); (b) significant growth (tumor size at least doubling) only in the final stage of the disease (11 patients); (c) initial significant growth followed by a period of no increase in size (5 patients). These findings show that in our geographical area (a) 2-yr survival of untreated asymptomatic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis does not differ from that of similar patients undergoing resection and (b) the tumor can exhibit long periods of no growth alternating with periods of exponential growth.\r"

Thirty-seven patients (29 adult, 8 pediatric) were admitted with fulminant hepatic failure. Ten improved with medical treatment, so liver transplantation was not recommended. Twenty-seven deteriorated despite medical treatment. Eight of these, 7 with grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy and persistent coagulopathy, did not receive transplantation because of contraindications (n = 5), failure to find a donor (n = 1), or refusal of therapy (n = 2). None of these survived. Sixteen of the other 19 patients developed grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy, 5 had brain edema, and all had persistent coagulopathy, so liver transplantation was performed. One year actuarial survival was 58%. This retrospective analysis confirms that survival exceeding 50% can be obtained with liver transplantation in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Additional studies of prognostic markers are needed to define the role of liver transplantation in the management of this disease.\r"

Although comparable results can be achieved through nonpharmacologic means, the time and effort involved precludes their widespread use. Despite near universal utilization of premedication in endoscopy, the associated risk is difficult to determine from the available literature. The reported data reveal nominal risk yet must be viewed as minimums. The ideal drug with predictable clinical effects, minimal postprocedure impairment, little respiratory compromise, and proven antagonist is not yet available. Although midazolam seems to represent an advance, recent emphasis on respiratory depression is particularly troublesome. Studies evaluating various agents have suffered from lack of quantitation of such parameters as patient tolerance, ease of examination, and postprocedure impairment. Development of proven standards for these parameters would have to occur before a definitive double-blind randomized trial could be undertaken. Suggested means of assessing these parameters are listed in Table I. Improvement in major morbidity would be difficult in light of its low incidence. As the search for the ideal drug continues, endoscopists must continue to use drugs whose full effects are incompletely understood. The ability to increase patient comfort must be balanced with the small, but ever present, risk of morbidity and mortality.\r"

Synthetic salmon calcitonin 415 pmol iv was given as a bolus followed by a 90 minute infusion to reach an overall dose of 62.25 pmol/kg. Gastric emptying of a radiolabelled meal was measured with a gamma camera. Calcitonin markedly delayed gastric emptying in all patients examined. The emptying index (Ix) decreased from 2.979 (0.397)/min after placebo to 0.896 (0.317)/min after calcitonin (p less than 0.001). Calcitonin did not affect significantly postprandial gastrin release: AUC0-90, 8768 (880) pg/l min (placebo) and 7807 (619) pg/l min (calcitonin). Postprandial insulin release was abolished by calcitonin -Auc0-90, 2258 (242) mU/l min (placebo) v 736 (131) mU/l min (calcitonin), p less than 0.001. Parallel to the suppression of insulin release was a steady increase in the serum glucose during calcitonin infusion, with the highest glucose concentration of 5.8 (0.53) mmol/l at the end of infusion of the hormone. Calcitonin did not change significantly serum calcium or phosphorus concentrations. A combination of a delaying effect on gastric emptying with the inhibition of gastric acid secretion elicited by calcitonin warrants further studies of calcinonin in the treatment of duodenal ulcer.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if loperamide is effective and safe in treating watery diarrhoea, we randomly assigned 50 adult expatriates in Bangladesh with more than three unformed stools in the previous 24 hours and illness of less than 72 hours to receive loperamide or a placebo. On entry into the five day study patients took two capsules (one loperamide capsule = 2 mg) and one after each unformed stool up to a maximum of eight per day. The groups did not significantly differ in pretreatment features or pathogens identified. Mean number of stools on study day 1 was 2.6 in the loperamide group and 4.0 in the placebo group (p = 0.035); on day 2 it was 1.3 versus 3.4 (p less than 0.001). Differences in stool frequencies during the final three study days, or proportion of patients with cramps, nausea, or vomiting on any study day, were not significant. No serious side effects occurred in either group. We conclude that loperamide, by decreasing stool frequency during the early part of illness, may have a role in the symptomatic treatment of this self-limiting disease.\r"

In the fasting state, the portal vein caliber was significantly higher in patients with liver cirrhosis than in normal subjects and patients with chronic active hepatitis, whereas the mean flow velocity in the portal vein was significantly lower in this group. Basal flow volume of the portal vein was greater in patients with liver cirrhosis than in normal subjects and patients with chronic active hepatitis. Sixty minutes after the standard meal, we observed both in normal subjects and in patients with chronic active hepatitis a significant increase of mean caliber, mean velocity and flow volume in the portal vein, whereas in patients with liver cirrhosis, these parameters remained almost unchanged. In addition, the examination of individual patterns showed that flow velocity and flow volume in the portal vein decreased in some cirrhotic patients after the meal. This behavior is probably related to the hypertensive state in the splanchnic venous bed and diversion of splanchnic blood flow into spontaneous portosystemic collaterals.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of two vasodilators, papaverine and pentoxifylline (a methylxanthine derivative), on liver function after 19 hr hypothermic preservation were investigated. Hypothermic preservation was performed according to the standard technique, and liver hemodynamics and function were studied during 70 min immediately after reperfusion in an isolated perfused rat liver system. No significant changes occurred after hypothermic storage for 5 hr. However, when the storage was prolonged to 19 hr, bile flow and taurocholate intrinsic clearance were significantly reduced; transaminase release was markedly increased and histological studies demonstrated centrilobular necrosis. Concomitantly, liver blood flow was significantly reduced and intrahepatic vascular resistance was increased. Papaverine and pentoxifylline administered during preservation and at the time of reperfusion significantly improved all parameters. The improvement was more pronounced after pentoxifylline, and this group showed no significant difference in any of the studied parameters from the control livers. The results show that two vasodilators significantly protect the liver during long hypothermic preservation. The data suggest that abnormalities of liver microcirculation are of major importance in the pathogenesis of liver injury after hypothermic storage.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, it was investigated whether the prostacyclin derivative Iloprost would protect hepatocytes against CCl4-induced liver injury and which mechanism(s) of hepatocellular pathogenesis might be affected by it. Rats were treated with a single oral dose of CCl4 (2 ml per kg); Iloprost was infused continuously from 2 to 4 hr before intoxication until killing. The following results were obtained. The CCl4-induced release of AST, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase into the serum was reduced by 50 to 70% in rats treated with doses of 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms Iloprost per kg per min. Infusion of 0.02 and 0.004 micrograms Iloprost per kg per min did not affect the CCl4-induced enzyme release into the blood. CCl4 induced the occurrence of aldehydes (products of lipid peroxidation), which were detected by histochemical and biochemical means. At 12, 48 and 72 hr after CCl4, the aldehyde-positive liver section area was about 58, 69 and 16% in rats treated with CCl4 alone, but only about 18, 13 and less than 1% in rats treated additionally with Iloprost. The aldehyde-positive hepatocytes were located predominantly in the centrilobular zone of the liver. At 24 hr the extent of the aldehyde-positive section area was the same in rats with or without Iloprost treatment (about 90%). Biochemical determination, however, revealed that at this time point the malondialdehyde content after Iloprost in rats was about 70% lower than without Iloprost treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In both species, adrenergic fibers were identified within portal tracts, often in close proximity to hepatic artery branches. In guinea pig liver, but not rat liver, abundant intraacinar fibers were identified; fibers were also seen within the walls of terminal hepatic vein radicles and larger hepatic veins. The presence of peptidergic nerves containing the regulatory peptide neuropeptide tyrosine and the C-flanking peptide CPON was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence. The distribution of these nerves was similar to that of tyrosine hydroxylase- and dopamine beta-hydroxylase-positive nerves and showed the same species difference. The effector sympathetic nature of tyrosine hydroxylase- and neuropeptide tyrosine-positive fibers in rat liver was confirmed by chemical denervation studies using 6-hydroxydopamine.\r"

To examine this issue, the relationship between occurrence of gallstone disease diagnosed by ultrasonography and complaints about abdominal pain and discomfort was assessed in a random sample comprising 4,581 males and females, of whom 3,608 (79%) took part in the investigation. As regards the presence of gallstones, the predictive values of various complaints about pain and discomfort were very low, ranging from zero to 25.0%, whereas for the absence of gallstones the predictive value of no complaints about pain or discomfort was very high, ranging from 93.2 to 94.2%. In subjects with gallstones, the prevalence of upper right quadrantic pain during the last 12 months was equal to that in subjects with a normal gallbladder, whereas in cholecystectomized subjects the prevalence of pain was significantly higher. Pain was not associated with size, number or motility of the stones. It is concluded that in a random population it is difficult to define the symptoms specific for gallstones and thereby to distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic gallstones.\r"

In this paper, we report the clinical significance of human hepatocyte growth factor in blood from patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The effect of sera or plasma from 17 patients with fulminant hepatic failure on liver cell growth was examined by use of adult rat hepatocytes in primary cultures. Sera or plasma from 16 of the 17 patients with fulminant hepatic failure stimulated DNA synthesis in hepatocytes more effectively than normal human serum. The mean growth-promoting activity for the 17 patients with fulminant hepatic failure was about 16 times higher than that obtained for normal human serum. This growth-promoting activity of the patients' blood was not related to sex, age, clinical outcome of the patients or type of fulminant hepatic failure, but was intimately related to the clinical grade of hepatic coma. Sera or plasma with Grade III and IV coma showed stimulatory activity on DNA synthesis more markedly than sera or plasma from patients with coma of less than Grade II. In the surviving group, this activity decreased as the hepatic coma of patients improved. In fact, this activity of sera from patients at the recovery stage showed no significant increase compared with that of normal human serum. In the group of terminal patients, this activity increased as the coma developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The lack of overall efficacy of nifedipine was attributable to a high incidence of side effects, including an unusual symptom complex resembling erythromelalgia. These side effects led 45% (9/20) of the nifedipine patients to withdraw from the study within two weeks. By contrast, no patient (0/18) withdrew from the study within the first 2 weeks of propranolol therapy. We conclude that nifedipine is not an agent of first choice for the prophylaxis of migraine.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve acromegalic patients in whom standard therapy was unsuccessful were evaluated with 24-h serum GH profiles (hourly sampling) and oral glucose tests (oGTT) while being treated with octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analog. During a dose-response study (300, 600, and 1500 micrograms/day sc, for 4 weeks), serum GH decreased significantly after 300 micrograms/day in 8 of 12 patients [from 14.5 +/- 6.2 (+/- SE) to 4.9 +/- 1.9 micrograms/L]. Higher doses further reduced serum GH concentrations in 3 (600 micrograms/day) and 1 (1500 micrograms/day) patients, respectively. Four patients did not respond to any dose. Serum GH concentrations declined normally (GH nadir, less than 2 micrograms/L) after glucose ingestion in 4 of the 10 nondiabetic acromegalic patients. In 4 patients, including 2 of the initial nonresponders, serum GH further declined during long term treatment (12 and 18 months). In the latter 2 patients, serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations had decreased during the dose-response study despite the absence of measurable GH suppression. Eight patients attained normal serum IGF-I concentrations during treatment. Serum IGF-I and GH correlated significantly before, but not during, treatment. Retrospective comparison suggested that in 5 of 6 patients, serum GH was more effectively suppressed by octreotide than by bromocriptine. The 24-h serum octreotide concentration varied greatly among the patients. Although the 24-h serum octreotide and GH concentrations did not correlate with one another, the serum octreotide and IGF-I concentrations when the patients were receiving 300 micrograms/day tended to be negatively correlated (r = -0.496; P = 0.118). The 24-h serum insulin values decreased and those of glucose increased during treatment; after oral glucose, serum insulin was lower and glucose was higher. However, after 12 months of treatment, the 8-h serum insulin profile and peak serum insulin after oral glucose administration had returned to pretreatment values, while serum glucose remained abnormal. We conclude that 1) octreotide lowers serum GH in many, but not all, acromegalic patients resistant to other forms of treatment; 2) doses in excess of 300 micrograms/day should be tested in those patients in whom lower doses are ineffective; 3) serum IGF-I measurement may be a better indicator of treatment success than GH measurement; 4) octreotide concentrations do not correlate with GH suppression; and 5) deterioration of carbohydrate tolerance does occur but tends to improve during chronic treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Hyper- and euglycemic clamp studies were performed in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus to examine the effects of exogenous insulin administration on insulin and glucagon secretion. Plasma glucose was kept at the fasting level [mean, 10.0 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) mmol/L; hyperglycemic clamp], and graded doses of insulin (1, 3, and 10 mU/kg.min, each for 50 min) were infused. The plasma C-peptide level gradually decreased from 523 +/- 66 to 291 +/- 43 pmol/L (n = 13; P less than 0.005) by the end of the hyperglycemic clamp study. After 90 min of equilibration with euglycemia (5.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/L; euglycemic clamp), the same insulin infusion protocol caused a similar decrease in the plasma C-peptide level. With the same glucose clamp protocol, physiological hyperinsulinemia for 150 min (676 +/- 40 pmol/L), obtained by the infusion of 2 mU/kg.min insulin, caused suppression of the plasma C-peptide level from 536 +/- 119 to 273 +/- 65 pmol/L during hyperglycemia and from 268 +/- 41 to 151 +/- 23 pmol/L during euglycemia (n = 9; P less than 0.005 in each clamp). Plasma glucagon was suppressed to a similar degree in both glycemic states. These results demonstrate that 1) insulin secretion in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is suppressed by high physiological doses of exogenous insulin in both the hyper- and euglycemic states, the degree of inhibition being independent of the plasma glucose level; and 2) glucagon secretion is also inhibited by such doses of exogenous insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between plasma insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) concentrations in normal subjects have not been defined. We performed iv glucose tolerance tests on 102 normal subjects, aged 5-20 yr. The subjects were divided into 4 groups according to pubertal stage (Tanner): A, stage 1 (n = 22); B, stages 2 and 3 (n = 17); C, stages 4 and 5 (n = 20); and D, adult, greater than 17 yr (n = 43). The basal plasma IGF-I and insulin concentrations and incremental 0-60 min insulin areas in response to glucose rose significantly throughout puberty (P less than 0.001 for all parameters) and declined to prepubertal levels by the third decade of life. There was a strong positive correlation between log fasting plasma insulin vs. log plasma IGF-I (r = 0.625; P less than 0.001) and log incremental 0-60 min insulin areas vs. log plasma IGF-I (r = 0.572; P less than 0.001). Plasma DHEAS concentrations were measured in groups A-C (n = 59); these also rose throughout puberty. There was strong correlations between log plasma DHEAS and log basal or stimulated (incremental 0-60 min areas) insulin responses (P less than 0.001). To assess the relationship between plasma DHEAS and insulin before puberty, we analyzed the data from group A separately. Plasma DHEAS concentrations tended to be higher in children 9 yr of age or older than in those less than 9 yr old, whereas basal and stimulated plasma insulin levels were similar. We found no correlation between log plasma insulin (fasting or stimulated responses) and log plasma DHEAS concentrations in group A (P greater than 0.05). In conclusion, we found a strong relationship between plasma insulin and IGF-I throughout childhood and puberty and during adult life. This finding suggests that insulin may be important for normal growth during childhood. There was no correlation between plasma insulin and DHEAS concentrations in prepubertal children, which suggests that adrenarche does not influence insulin levels.\r"

We examined the responses to an oral glucose tolerance test in 30 normal men before and after 6 weekly injections of androgen administered in a double-blinded study design. The men were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: testosterone enanthate (TE), 100 or 300 mg/week, or 19-nortestosterone decanoate (ND), 100 or 300 mg/week. Serum testosterone levels, measured 2-3 days after the last dose, did not change in the men given 100 mg TE/week, increased 3-fold in those given 300 mg TE/week, and decreased in both ND groups. All four groups had comparable reductions in serum LH levels. Weight increased significantly in all except the 100 mg TE/week group, but there was no change in waist to hip ratio in any group. In spite of the demonstrated biological effects of the doses of steroid administered, androgen administration for 6 weeks did not increase fasting serum glucose or insulin concentrations. There was also no increase in peak serum insulin levels and areas under the insulin and glucose response curves after a 100-g oral glucose load. However, the mean serum insulin area under the curve decreased significantly in the men given 300 mg ND/week. In contrast to the results of studies of 17-alkylated androgens, our results demonstrate that pharmacological doses of testosterone and the administration of 19-nortestosterone for 6 weeks do not impair glucose tolerance or alter insulin secretion in normal men.\r"

The sensitivity of this method for detecting malignant disease was 86%. Cytology was not able to provide conclusive results of benign conditions. Difficulties were encountered in diagnosing well differentiated carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumours and distinguishing them from reactive epithelium and islet cell hyperplasia, respectively. This resulted in a 12.1% false negative rate. There were no complications in our series. Percutaneous fine needle aspiration proved a reliable method of diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma.\r"

The typical clinical presentation was of an uneventual initial postoperative period, followed by a sudden deterioration in graft function, progressing rapidly to graft failure. All six patients died. The characteristic pathological changes were those of massive haemorrhage and hepatocyte necrosis with only mild inflammation and without occlusive lesions in large arteries or veins. These distinctive features differed from other recognised patterns of graft damage and seemed to comprise a specific post-transplant syndrome. The pathogenesis was not clear and in the absence of any definite aetiology it is suggested that the term \"massive haemorrhagic necrosis\" be used to describe these cases. Additional findings seen in five of the six cases were venoocclusive lesions (n = 4) and a combination of ductopenia and foam cell arteriopathy (n = 2). The presence of these associated lesions suggests that there may be an overlap with other types of graft damage.\r"

Its broad reactivity with cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage was established by testing on routinely processed samples of normal and reactive lymphoid tissues. Interdigitating reticulum cells were unstained or showed limited cytoplasmic staining while Langerhans' cells and follicular dendritic reticulum cells were unreactive. KP1 recognises a molecule of about 110 kilodaltons in macrophage-rich human tissue when tested by either immunoprecipitation or Western blotting (although the latter procedure also shows two additional components with molecular weights of 70 and 40 kilodaltons). KP1 should be of considerable value for studying disorders of the monocyte/macrophage system, including both reactive and neoplastic states (such as true histiocytic proliferations).\r"

Although sweat secretion and ductal absorption are basically biophysical and biologic cellular processes, a detailed description of the basic biophysical principles of membrane transport has been avoided to make the discussion more readable. The cited references will, however, help those readers primarily interested in the basic details of sweat gland function. Part I of this article includes a discussion of morphologic characteristics, central and peripheral nervous control of sweat secretion, neurotransmitters, intracellular mediators and stimulus secretion coupling, Na-K-Cl cotransport model for the ionic mechanism of sweat secretion, ingredients of sweat, ductal function, the pathogenesis of abnormal sweat gland function in cystic fibrosis, and the discovery of the apoeccrine sweat gland. Part II, to be published in the May issue of the Journal, reviews reports of all those major disorders of hyperhidrosis and hypohidrosis that have appeared in the literature during the past 10 years. It is hoped that this review will serve as a resource for clinicians who encounter puzzling disorders of sweating in their patients, as well as for investigators who wish to obtain a quick update on sweat gland function.\r"

  ".W": "For the past two decades fumaric acid (FA) therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment in Western Europe for psoriasis. FA therapy originally was developed by Schweckendiek and subsequently standardized by Schafer. Schafer's fumaric acid compound therapy (FACT) consists of the oral intake of dimethylfumaric acid ester (DMFAE) and several salts of monoethylfumaric acid ester (MEFAE) in combination with topical fumaric acid therapy (1% to 3% MEFAE in an ointment or FA in bathing oils) and a diet. Schafer claimed excellent results in a large number of patients. Preliminary studies by German dermatologists, however, revealed contradictory therapeutic results and serious side effects, and FA treatment was soon abandoned by dermatologists. To assess the value of FA therapy we conducted an open pilot study of 36 patients in which FACT therapy appeared to be rather effective. Thereafter, several controlled studies with MEFAE sodium in two different dosages versus placebo, and DMFAE versus placebo, were done. The results indicated that MEFAE sodium in dosages up to 240 mg daily was ineffective, whereas daily dosages of 720 mg resulted in a significant decrease in scaling and itching but did not affect extension of the eruption. DMFAE, 240 mg daily, produced a significant amelioration and prevented extension. Side effects of FA treatment were nausea, diarrhea, general malaise, and severe stomachache. Mild disturbances of liver and kidney function during treatment were observed with the 720 mg dosage of MEFAE and with the 240 mg dosage of DMFAE. Moreover, a relative lymphopenia with a selective decrease of suppressor T lymphocytes occurred in about 50% of the patients treated with DMFAE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Polidocanol 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.0% were compared with regard to clinical effectiveness, safety, and patient acceptance. All dosages were well tolerated by the patients. There were no allergic reactions to polidocanol and no cases of superficial ulceration nor necrosis. Among those whose veins cleared, there was little difference in time to clearing for the four concentrations, which averaged three to four treatment sessions. No statistically significant differences existed among the four dosages with respect to level of improvement, itching, or neovascularization. Polidocanol 0.75% and 1.0%, however, caused more side effects noted by patients and induced more hyperpigmentation than did the lower concentrations. Polidocanol 0.25% yielded the lowest percentage of patients whose veins cleared. The 0.50% solution was the most effective concentration for total overall clearing of the types of vessels treated in this study. From this information it appears that 0.50% polidocanol may be the sclerosing agent of choice.\r"

The epidemiologic data strongly suggest that an environmental factor initiates the autoantibody response in the host. As such it is an important disease for in-depth study. A group of interested investigators in both Brazil and the United States has been formed to attempt to do just that. As part of the overall effort, this Cooperative Research Group for the Study of Fogo Selvagem presents a definition of the disease, a proposed clinical classification for various forms of the disease, and an outline of what is currently known of its immunopathologic characteristics.\r"
