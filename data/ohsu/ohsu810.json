Human milk contains about 50% of energy as fat, a large portion of it saturated fat. Commercial infant formulas mimic this proportion but use vegetable sources; most of them also duplicate the saturated fat fraction. At present, only linoleic acid is known to be an essential fatty acid. However, if all but 2% to 3% of energy had to come from sources other than fat, the energy density of the feed would be low, perhaps too low to permit ingestion of adequate energy. On the other hand, if fat concentration were increased at the expense of carbohydrates, ketosis would result.\r"

  ".W": "Growth outcome for 1 year of corrected age and feeding practices during that first year of life were described for a large population of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Growth patterns of weight, length, and occipitofrontal circumference through 12 months of corrected age, and weight/length ratios at 12 months, were determined for 122 VLBW infants less than or equal to 1500 gm and less than or equal to 35 weeks of gestational age at birth; feeding practices were surveyed within a subpopulation of 89 infants. Differences in growth were apparent when infants were grouped according to sex and appropriateness of intrauterine growth. When the mean values of each group were compared, the female infants of appropriate size for gestational age demonstrated growth at higher percentiles (National Center for Health Statistics term-infant norms) for all three measurements (weight, length, and occipitofrontal circumference). Male infants whose size was appropriate for gestational age, and male and female infants who were small for gestational age, all grew similarly, at lower percentiles for weight and length, when compared with the same norms. Growth in occipitofrontal circumference was closest to term infant norms in all subgroups of infants. The majority of the infants, regardless of subgroup, achieved weights and lengths greater than 5th percentile and proportionate growth with a normal weight/length ratio. At 12 months of corrected age, 30% remained at less than 5th percentile in weight, 21% in length, and 14% in occipitofrontal circumference. Eighteen infants (15%) had a marked discrepancy in weight for length, with a weight/length ratio less than 5th percentile. Three prevalent practices that could result in compromised nutrition were identified: (1) cereals were introduced at an early age, (2) 2% and skim cow milk were fed to approximately 50% of the infants within the first year of life, and (3) whole cow milk was introduced to some VLBW infants at an early age. Caretakers apparently viewed their infants in terms of chronologic age rather than age corrected for prematurity when it came to the initiation of solids and cow milk. Whether increased attention to appropriate feeding practices during the first year of life would result in a more favorable growth outcome for VLBW infants is not known.\r"

This article examines four categories of feeding skills: taking food from a spoon; handling thicker, lumpy foods and foods that require chewing; self-feeding with fingers or a spoon; and drinking from a cup and managing the bottle. These skills are fundamental for the development of self-regulatory competence through the phases of sensorimotor modulation (from 3 months of age to approximately 9 to 12 months) and control (9 to 12 months of age). Available instruments to assess feeding skill and self-regulatory competence are described. Questions concerning feeding practices in relation to the infant's development of feeding skill and self-regulatory competence are raised. Potential conflicts between professional and lay sources, informational methods used and preferred, and the types of problems for which help is sought are discussed.\r"

Using contemporary data regarding nutrient intakes from beikost, I examined the total nutrient intake of 6- to 12-month-old infants. Nutrient intakes of infants fed beikost plus iron-fortified formulas designed for younger infants are entirely satisfactory. On the other hand, when cow milk is fed together with beikost, infants receive unnecessarily high intakes of protein and electrolytes, resulting in an unduly high renal solute load. Because cow milk is also prone to cause occult intestinal blood loss, it is not considered a suitable feeding for 6- to 12-month-old infants.\r"

Data on what Americans are eating are fragmentary and undoubtedly outdated, because products continually change. Many, but not all, changes in consumption are in the right direction. This trend will continue, but we will be increasingly dependent on the food industries as more convenient foods are demanded. No one recommends very low fat diets for infants. There appears to be no evidence of risk at the recommended level of 30% of calories as fat. There will undoubtedly be some problems resulting from overemphasis on the risks associated with fat, sugar, and so forth, but there is no basis for questioning the general advice about what Americans should eat. Children must and eventually will learn to eat the family diet.\r"

  ".W": "Food and nutrient intakes of infants during the second 6 months of life were summarized with the use of four national surveys as the data base. Three of the surveys, the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1976-1980), the Ross Nutrition Survey (1984), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (1977-1978), summarized and compared the nutrient composition of the diets of infants fed formula with that of the diets of infants fed cow milk during the second 6 months of life. The Gerber Nutrition Survey (GNS) summarized the nutrient composition of the diets of infants fed formula, cow milk, or human milk, or a combination of these, during 1986. Iron-fortified formula with beikost provided adequate but not excessive intakes of all nutrients for infants during the second 6 months of life with the possible exception of calcium for older infants. In contrast to cow milk, formula provided readily absorbed and adequate iron, generous linoleic acid, and adequate but not excessive intakes of protein, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium. The distribution of energy between protein, carbohydrate and fat, and potential renal solute load was reasonable in infants fed formula. Cow milk with beikost provided low intakes of readily bioavailable iron and linoleic acid and high intakes of protein, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and potential renal solute load during the second 6 months of life. The diets of infants fed low-fat milks were even lower in linoleic acid and higher in volume of food consumed, protein, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and potential renal solute load than the diets of infants fed whole cow milk. Apparently, infants fed cow milk were treated differently than those fed formula (i.e., they were given more solids and table foods and less baby food at all ages and less volume of milk at 9 and 12 months of age). These data provided the basis for the development of practical suggestions for feeding infants during the second 6 months of life.\r"

  ".U": "90339505\r", 
  ".W": "Since our original proposal 4 years ago, considerable support has evolved for the concept of pharmacologically guided dose escalation in phase I clinical trials with new anticancer drugs. The original focus has been broadened to develop additional links between preclinical testing and phase I clinical trials. Recent experiences with very lengthy phase I trials for at least eight drugs have provided particular impetus for this project. The original pharmacodynamic hypothesis for the proposal was equal toxicity at equal plasma levels. Specifically, two facets of the concept were that (a) dose-limiting toxicity correlates with, and in turn is predicted by, drug concentrations in plasma and (b) that the quantitative relationship between toxicity and drug exposure, as measured by plasma drug concentration times time (C x T), holds across species. If true, this hypothesis would suggest that dose escalations in humans could be safely based on measurement of drug levels in plasma, rather than on empirical escalation schemes. In addition to the collection of a larger retrospective data base to validate this hypothesis, practical results have already been achieved. In two studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the escalation pattern was prospectively modified on the basis of measurements of drug levels in plasma. In addition, for three NCI-sponsored drugs, more careful matching of schedules between clinical and preclinical testing produced entry doses that were up to 25 times higher than doses used in standard procedures. Consequently, the phase I trials for each drug were completed with a savings of 12-24 months. As a result of work in both the United States and Europe, a substantial collection of data now demonstrates that coordination with preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies can save both time and resources in early clinical trials without a loss of safety.\r"

  ".U": "90339507\r", 
  ".W": "The major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon inducible-cytochrome P4501A1 gene (CYP1A1) is presumed to be important in pulmonary carcinogenesis and toxicology because its product, the cytochrome P4501A1-dependent (CYP1A1-dependent) monooxygenase, transforms selected xenobiotics (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon procarcinogens in cigarette smoke) to potent carcinogenic metabolites. CYP1A1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression has not, however, been previously demonstrated in human pulmonary tissue. This report defines CYP1A1 gene expression in normal lung tissue and primary pulmonary carcinoma tissue obtained at thoracotomy from 56 patients with lung cancer. When Northern blot hybridization analyses were performed, 17 of 19 (89%) and zero of five (0%) samples of normal lung tissue from active cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, respectively, expressed the normal 2.8-kilobase CYP1A1 mRNA. In addition, a time-dependent decrease in expression of the CYP1A1 gene was noted in normal lung tissue from individuals who were former smokers, with a decrease in expression occurring as early as 2 weeks following cessation of cigarette smoking. Expression became undetectable in all patients who had stopped smoking more than 6 weeks prior to study. When CYP1A1 gene expression was evaluated in lung cancers, mRNA levels were detectable in one of four (25%) tumors from nonsmokers; two of 24 (8%) tumors from former smokers; and seven of 15 (47%) tumors from cigarette smokers. In addition, an approximately 10-kilobase CYP1A1 RNA species, which was not detectable in normal lung tissue, was observed in five of ten (50%) of the lung cancers that expressed the CYP1A1 gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intralesional treatment of implanted malignant murine brain tumors (KHT sarcomas) with killed Corynebacterium parvum produced an inflammatory cell infiltrate and increased survival in C3H mice relative to that in untreated control C3H mice. This antitumor effect was enhanced when recombinant interleukin-2 was sequentially added as a second intralesional immunomodifier. A high percentage of mice so treated were cured. Inflammatory cells in the brains of treated mice divided for 1-2 weeks, and metabolic activity of astrocytes increased. These findings form the basis for a recently initiated immunotherapy protocol in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.\r"

We recently reported that MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells are mitogenically responsive to insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I). We now demonstrate for the first time that suramin interferes with the interaction between IGF-I and its receptor and abolishes in vitro IGF-I-stimulated proliferation of these osteosarcoma cells. The fact that cell proliferation resumes when suramin is removed indicates that this is not a cytotoxic effect. We conclude that IGF-I should be added to the list of growth factors whose bioactivity can be attenuated by suramin and that clinical studies of suramin and its analogues are indicated in IGF-I-receptor-positive malignancies such as osteogenic sarcoma.\r"

T-cell proliferative response to mitogen stimulation was assessed. T-cell antigen expression following PHA stimulation was assessed for helper (CD4) and suppressor (CD8) subpopulations: the early T-cell activation antigens interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) and transferrin receptor (TFR), and the late antigen (HLA-DR) using flow cytometry. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte function was assessed using oxidative burst. There was a reduction in the proliferative response of T cells to mitogen stimulation. The B-cell response seemed unaffected. The diminished proliferative response was accompanied by diminished expression of early activation antigens (IL2R and TFR) and late (following DNA synthesis) (HLA-DR). This was seen primarily on helper/inducer cells (CD4+). Polymorphonuclear leukocyte function was unaffected.\r"

We studied the effect of AOXC on mean arterial pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and cerebral water content in a porcine model of focal cryogenic brain injury. Four groups of animals were studied: Group I--brain injury only; Group II--brain injury and AOXC; Group III--brain injury with hemorrhage and AOXC; and Group IV--AOXC only. Focal cryogenic grain injury increased the ICP in Groups I-III. Aortic crossclamping increased MAP, CBF, ICP, and CPP after hemorrhage in Group III. Following declamping and resuscitation there were no differences between the groups in any studied variable. Cerebral water content at the site of the focal brain injury was greater than in nonlesioned cortex but there was no significant difference between groups despite a greater positive fluid balance in hemorrhaged animals. AOXC improved perfusion to the injured brain without a significant increase in ICP. Increased MAP induced by AOXC and large fluid resuscitation appeared to have no detrimental effect on ICP, CBF, cerebral water content, or CPP in this model of brain injury.\r"

The lost billing from the trauma service and the other clinical services approximated +8.0 million/yr. This equated to an +13.5 million decrease in the anticipated billings for the year.

Groups were similar with respect to transfusions, hypotension, and associated injuries, but more patients over age 50 years underwent early fixation. Patients were categorized according to Injury Severity Score (ISS): 1) less than 15 (n = 202), 2) 16-35 (n = 104), and 3) greater than 36 (n = 33). Delayed fixation significantly increased the incidence of pulmonary shunt in ISS (3) patients and of pneumonia in patients older than 50. Late fixation resulted in significantly longer hospital stays in all groups and more ICU days in the ISS (3) group. We believe that early femur fixation should be performed on all patients. Pulmonary complications were decreased and health care costs reduced.\r"

  ".W": "Rib fractures and other chest wall injuries can lead to weak ventilation, atelectasis, and even death. Whereas such injuries in young patients are usually well tolerated, relatively minor chest wall trauma can be serious in elderly patients. Epidural analgesia, by improving pain control and ventilatory function, might improve morbidity and mortality rates compared to other forms of analgesia. Stepwise logistic regression was used to compare thoracic trauma patients more than 60 years of age treated with either epidural or parenteral (IV/IM) analgesia. In spite of more severe thoracic trauma in epidural patients as measured by the Abbreviated Injury Score for the chest (epidural = 3.3 +/- 0.1, IV/IM = 2.8 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.05) the use of epidural analgesia was an independent predictor of both decreased mortality (p = 0.0035) and a decreased incidence of pulmonary complications (p = 0.0088). Epidural analgesia has a positive effect on outcome in elderly trauma victims with chest wall injury and is useful in high-risk patients. Increased costs associated with epidural analgesia are minimal and are justified by improvements in outcome.\r"

  ".W": "The role of extravascular lung water (EVLW) in the pathogenesis of inhalation injury (INH) when associated with concomitant major burn (B) remains controversial. Previous experimental models have investigated isolated INH without surface burn. This study measured the effects of isolated and combined INH on EVLW and pO2 in a porcine experimental model. The beneficial effects of early resuscitation with dextran-40 (DEX) were assessed, using a control group receiving standard Parkland formula (LR). In the first part of the study (INH vs. INH + B), a group of animals with a standardized INH was compared to a group also receiving a standardized 40% BSA third-degree surface burn (n = 8, each group). With serial measurements for 5 hours, EVLW was only modestly increased unless INH was accompanied by surface burn: 20.3 +/- 4.2 vs. 32.0 +/- 4.1 ml/kg at 5 hours (p less than 0.01). Similarly, pO2 fell much more dramatically in the INH + B group, 61 +/- 5 vs. 37 +/- 5 torr (p less than 0.05). The second part of the study compared standard Parkland crystalloid resuscitation with dextran-40 resuscitation in animals receiving a combined INH + B injury (LR vs. DEX, n = 8, each group). DEX resuscitation resulted in substantially lower accumulation of EVLW out to 5 hours, 34.1 +/- 5.0 vs. 13.1 +/- 3.0 ml/kg (p less than 0.01), and significantly better pO2, 35 +/- 5 vs. 64 +/- 4 torr (p less than 0.01). Conclusions: Inhalation injury did not dramatically increase EVLW in this animal model unless accompanied by concomitant major surface burn. The deterioration in EVLW and pO2 seen in the combined injury was significantly improved with DEX resuscitation when compared to standard crystalloid resuscitation. Further study is indicated and clinical trials may be warranted.\r"

Examination of the experience at our trauma center and in this region, before and after the enactment of a \"strong\" required request law by the State of New Jersey, did not reveal a statistically significant change in organ procurement. We conclude that such laws are unlikely to achieve the desired result in the absence of fundamental changes in the attitudes of the public and treating physicians.\r"

Since many proteins lose function when glycosylated, we assessed the effect of hyperglycemia on the function of immunoglobulin G. Twenty newborn Sprague-Dawley rats underwent splenectomy and 20, splenic mobilization alone. After 3 weeks, all animals received an intraperitoneal injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Twelve hours later, ten animals from each group received either control (CIG) or glycosylated (GIG) human immunoglobulin (0.3 gm/kg) intraperitoneally. Asplenic animals receiving GIG lived 28.5 hours vs. 49.6 hours for those receiving CIG (p less than 0.0001). Animals with spleens receiving GIG lived 48.2 hours vs. 51.7 hours for those receiving CIG (p = 0.03). Short-term glycosylation of immunoglobulin causes its inactivation. This may contribute to the increased risk of infection noted in hyperglycemic animals.\r"

  ".W": "Early deaths from trauma are often caused by exsanguinating hemorrhage from injuries that appear \"irreparable.\" We explored the limits of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest induced during hemorrhagic shock to enable repair of these injuries in a bloodless field. In 15 dogs, after 30 minutes of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure, 40 mm Hg), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was used to cool to 15 degrees C in 13-37 minutes. After circulatory arrest of 60 (Group 1), 90 (Group 2), or 120 (Group 3) minutes, reperfusion and rewarming were accomplished by CPB. All dogs survived greater than 72 hours. Best neurologic deficit scores (ND) (0% = normal, 100% = brain death) were 0 +/- 0% (normal) in Group 1, 10 +/- 8% (mild disability) in Group 2, and 27 +/- 24% in Group 3. Outcome in Group 3 dogs ranged from near-normal to comatose. After perfusion-fixation sacrifice, brain histopathologic damage scores correlated with insult time, as did ND scores. Deep hypothermia can allow 60-90 min of circulatory arrest with good neurologic recovery, even after a period of severe hemorrhagic shock. This technique may allow repair of otherwise lethal injuries and survival without brain damage.\r"

  ".U": "90339527\r", 
  ".W": "From January 1, 1985, to September 10, 1988, 210 consecutive patients with high-energy pelvic ring disruptions (exclusive of acetabular fractures) were admitted to a statewide referral center for adult multiple trauma. They were treated by one of four attending orthopaedic traumatologists per protocol as determined by their injury classification and hemodynamic status; the injury classification system was based on the vector of force involved and the quantification of disruption from that force, i.e., lateral compression, anteroposterior compression, vertical shear, and combined mechanical injury. Of the 210 patients, 162 had complete charts: 126 (78.0%) were admitted directly from the scene, 110 (67.9%) were injured in motor vehicle or motorcycle accidents, 25 (15.0%) were admitted in shock (blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), the average Glasgow Coma Score was 13.2, and the average Injury Severity Score was 25.8. Treatment of the pelvic fracture included the following methods (alone or in combination): acute external fixation (45.0; 28.0%), open reduction/internal fixation (22; 13.5%), acute arterial embolization (11; 7.0%), and bedrest (68; 42.0%). Overall blood replacement averaged 5.9 units (lateral compression, 3.6 units; anteroposterior compression, 14.8 units; vertical shear, 9.2 units; combined mechanical, 8.5 units). Overall mortality was 8.6% (lateral compression, 7.0%; anteroposterior, 20.0%, vertical shear, 0%; combined mechanical, 18.0%). The cause of death was associated with the pelvic fracture in less than 50%; no patient with an isolated or vertical shear pelvic injury died. We conclude that the predictive value of our classification system (incorporating appreciation of the causative forces and resulting injury patterns) and our classification-based treatment protocols reduce the morbidity and mortality related to pelvic ring disruption.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the use of an occlusive hydrocolloid dressing (Duoderm hydroactive, Squibb) and silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene, Marion) cream in the outpatient management of second-degree burns. The inclusion criteria consisted of burns less than 15% total body surface area that were evaluated within 24 hours of injury and did not require hospital admission. Fifty patients were randomly assigned after having been screened through a list of seven exclusion criteria. On initial evaluation the burns were photographed and screened for causative agent, location, size, depth, tetanus status, and presence of associated burns and injuries. Patients were seen in followup at least biweekly and evaluated for wound bed healing, wound margin healing, pain, number of dressing changes between visits, and ease of dressing application and removal. On final evaluation the burns were photographed and inspected for appearance of the healed burn, repigmentation, wound contraction, approximate time for dressing change, patient compliance, limitation of activity, overall impression of the treatment, and number of days for complete healing. Results were compared using a two-tailed t-test with p less than 0.01. Both groups were statistically similar in age, sex, and size. Duoderm-treated burns had statistically significantly better wound healing, repigmentation, less pain, fewer dressing changes, less time for dressing changes, and less cost. Duoderm-treated patients had statistically significantly less limitation of activity, better patient compliance, greater patient comfort, better overall acceptance, and felt the treatment was more aesthetically pleasing. The results reveal that the Duoderm Hydroactive dressings are superior to Silvadene cream in the outpatient management of second-degree burns.\r"

The incidence of positive lavage was similar in each group. There was one false positive in the percutaneous group and none in the open method group. False negative results did not occur by either method. The percutaneous lavage method required less time for performance, had better patient tolerance, and only required one surgeon to perform the procedure. Percutaneous diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), in the hands of trauma surgeons, is a safe and acceptable alternative to the open DPL method and actually had several advantages as mentioned above.\r"

It is made by combining human fibrinogen concentrate with standard thrombin solutions containing calcium. Similar to epoxy glue, the two components are applied simultaneously in equal volumes resulting in an almost instantaneous formation of a coagulum. Fibrinogen concentrate is prepared in the blood bank from single donor plasma. Fibrin glue can be applied topically or injected into the parenchyma of solid organs. Twenty-six patients sustained hepatic or splenic trauma from May through August 1989--17 liver and nine splenic injuries. The glue was effective after one application in 21 patients and after a second in five. Hemostasis was achieved despite coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia in eight patients. There were no re-explorations for bleeding, and nine complications occurred in six patients. Our experience suggests fibrin glue is an effective, underutilized adjunctive hemostatic agent in trauma.\r"

  ".W": "In the management of cervical spine injuries, it is not always clear when to use halo immobilization alone, surgical fusion alone, or a combination of the two. To investigate the relative effectiveness of each of these approaches, we reviewed the medical records of 140 patients with cervical spine injuries treated with either halo immobilization or surgical fusion, or both. Seventy (50%) of the patients were neurologically intact on admission (two of these were paraplegic from previous injuries). Halo immobilization was used as the primary treatment in 99 patients, and yielded a successful fusion rate of 78%. Within this group, the 26 patients with hyperflexion-anterior subluxation injuries had only a 54% successful fusion rate, while the rate for the 73 with non-flexion injuries was 87% (Chi-square = 11.36; p = 0.0008). Surgical fusion was used as the primary treatment in 41 patients and as a subsequent treatment in the 22 for whom halo immobilization did not bring about fusion. Of these 63 patients treated with surgical fusion, six remained unstable after the surgery; five of these six had sustained a hyperflexion-anterior subluxation. One patient experienced neurologic deterioration after surgical fusion. There were three deaths in the entire series. Excluding fusion failure, complications with halo immobilization were frequent (25%) but usually minor; with surgical fusion, less frequent (6%) but usually more severe. We draw the following conclusions. 1) Halo immobilization brings about satisfactory healing for most fracture types. 2) Both halo immobilization and surgical fusion have relatively high failure rates in the treatment of hyperflexion-anterior subluxation injury, with or without bilaterally locked facets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Postoperatively three children with proximal injuries had no palpable pulse in the affected extremity. One patient died of underlying disease and another required amputation during initial surgery due to extensive soft-tissue injury. Followup revealed no dysfunction directly related to vascular insufficiency. Neurologic deficit was found in 33% of the children followed, but only in one was the limb totally nonfunctional. We conclude that the long-term outcome is largely dependent upon neurologic injury. Glass doors and large glass windows should be avoided in the vicinity of children's play areas.\r"

  ".W": "Ethylene oxide is now frequently used to chemically sterilize heat-sensitive materials in the hospital setting. Previous reports of neurotoxic effects of ethylene oxide have been described in animals and humans. Recent reports suggest that cognitive deficits may be associated with chronic low-level ethylene oxide exposure. We undertook this study of hospital workers with chronic ethylene oxide exposure and compared them with a non-exposed control group in an attempt to detect neurological and neuropsychological abnormalities. Ethylene oxide breathing zone levels of up to 250 ppm in exposed subjects were reported. All evaluations were done without examiners' knowledge of exposure status of the subjects. The exposed group was found to have a statistically significant lower P300 amplitude, bilaterally hypoactive distal deep tendon reflexes and poorer performance on neuropsychological tests involving psychomotor speed. Exposed subjects acknowledged more symptoms and higher levels of depression and anxiety. Nerve conduction velocities and EEG spectral analysis were similar in both exposed and control groups as were scores on most psychological tests. Based upon this information and prior reports, ethylene oxide should be considered in a differential diagnosis of neuropsychological, peripheral and central nervous system dysfunction in workplace settings associated with ethylene oxide exposure.\r"

To assess the chronic, subtle neuropsychologic effects of ethylene oxide, we performed a cross-sectional study of 25 hospital central supply workers exposed to low levels of ethylene oxide and 24 unexposed control workers. Subjects were tested using a neuropsychological screening battery by examiners blinded to exposure status. Testing results were reviewed independently by two neuropsychologists without knowledge of exposure. Subject status was categorized as normal, \"impaired,\" or disagreement (between the two neuropsychologists). There were significantly more subjects concordantly judged as impaired in the exposed group versus the control group (chi 2 (2) = 6.0861, p less than 0.05). Although limited by the cross-sectional study design and the global categorization, these findings suggest that CNS dysfunction and cognitive impairment may result from chronic ethylene oxide exposure in hospital central supply units.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate occult carbon monoxide poisoning in patients with neurologic illness, we prospectively studied 168 patients who presented to the emergency department between December 1987 and February 1988 with neurologic symptoms for evidence of carbon monoxide exposure. Patients with known carbon monoxide poisoning were excluded. The mean carboxyhemoglobin level was 3.1 percent; there were no significant differences in carboxyhemoglobin between categories of neurologic illness (F(5,162) = 1.35; p less than 0.25). Five patients (3 percent) had a carboxyhemoglobin greater than 10 percent, with levels ranging from 11.7 percent to 29.5 percent. After controlling for the effects of active and passive exposure to cigarette smoke, problems with the home heating system (odds ratio 9.6; p less than 0.03) and the presence of cohabitants with concurrent headache or dizziness (odds ratio 21.6; p less than 0.0001) were associated with an increased risk of a carboxyhemoglobin greater than 10 percent. A rule for obtaining carboxyhemoglobin tests only on patients who used gas stoves for heat or who had symptomatic cohabitants would have correctly identified all patients with carboxyhemoglobins greater than 10 percent, correctly excluded 77 percent of patients with lower levels, and eliminated the need for testing in 75 percent of cases. We conclude that unrecognized carbon monoxide poisoning occurs in a small but important fraction of patients with wintertime neurologic illness and can be identified by a characteristic risk factor profile.\r"

This study was undertaken to investigate the in vivo mutagenicity of rhodamine B, to compare the in vitro mutagenicity of two commercial preparations of the dye with that of known mutagens including rhodamine 6G and to elucidate the pharmacokinetics of rhodamine B in the rabbit. Following the i.v. treatment of adult female New Zealand White rabbits with rhodamine B (1 mg/kg body wt), the plasma concentration of rhodamine B decreased rapidly and was accompanied by the appearance of at least four fluorescent polar metabolites. These metabolites, as well as a very small amount of rhodamine B, were also present in the urine which, when tested in the Ames assay was not significantly mutagenic against Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 either with or without metabolic activation. Urine from a human subject who had been contaminated with marker dye was also non-mutagenic. Both commercial preparations of rhodamine B were found to be weakly mutagenic, using the same assay system. It is concluded that while appropriate hygiene measures should be exercised by users of products containing this dye, the results do not support the hypothesis that rhodamine B is a genotoxic hazard in the mammalian organism.\r"

We are unaware of any previous reports regarding the removal of digoxin-Fab fragment complex by continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration. Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration allows ultrafiltration of molecules less than 50,000 daltons. Because the digoxin-Fab fragment complex has a molecular weight of 45 - 50,000 daltons, we evaluated the efficiency of continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration in removing the digoxin-Fab fragment complex. Three piglets were given 100 mcg/kg digoxin IM, in divided doses. Animals were anesthetized and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration was begun using a Diafilter 10 cartridge. A mean ultrafiltration rate of 3.6 +/- 0.4 ml/min was obtained. The system equilibrated for 30 minutes and initial serum and ultrafiltrate digoxin levels were obtained. Mean serum values were total 6.20 +/- 1.74 ng/ml and free 3.72 +/- 0.88 ng/ml. Digibind 40 mg IV was given and then samples of serum and ultrafiltrate were obtained at 30, 60 and 90 minutes for digoxin levels. Mean values were as follows: 30 min serum total 54.23 +/- 26.13 ng/ml and free 0.08 +/- 0.08 ng/ml; 60 min serum total 61.24 +/- 27.31 ng/ml and free 0.07 +/- 0.04 ng/ml; and 90 min serum total 67.63 +/- 26.78 ng/ml and free 0.10 +/- 0.10 ng/ml. Ultrafiltrate levels throughout the experiment were negligible (less than or equal to 0.04 ng/ml). Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration appears to be ineffective in removing the digoxin-Fab fragment complex.\r"

Conium seed and Nicotiana glauca induced cleft palate and multiple congenital contractures in 100% of the kids born to pregnant goats gavaged with these plants. Multiple congenital contractures included torticollis, scoliosis, lordosis, arthrogryposis, rib cage anomalies, over extension, and flexure and rigidity of the joints. However, in goats gavaged with fresh Conium plant, fetal movement was inhibited for only about 5 hours after each individual dosage and gradually returned to control levels 12 hours after dosing. Fetal malformations in this group were limited from modest to moderate contractures of the front limbs, which resolved by 8-10 weeks post partum. No cleft palates were induced. Fetal movement was not inhibited in goats fed Lupinus caudatus and no cleft palates or multiple congenital contractures were induced in their offspring. The duration of the reduction in fetal movement appears to be an important factor in the severity and permanence of the deformities, particularly with cleft palate, spinal column defects, and severe joint deviation and fixation.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the effects of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, thromboxane receptor antagonist, and cyclooxygenase inhibitor in a canine arterial graft patency model. Fifty-six dogs were divided into a control (no treatment) and five treatment groups: thromboxane synthase inhibitor (U63557A; 15 mg/kg/tid); thromboxane receptor antagonist (SQ29548; 0.02 mg/kg/hr); high-dose aspirin (325 mg/day; low-dose aspirin (1 mg/kd/day; and aspirin plus dipyridamole (325 mg/day aspirin; 3 mg/kg/day dipyridamole). Drugs were orally administered except for thromboxane receptor antagonist, which was delivered intravenously by minosmotic pumps. After 24 hours of drug treatment, bilateral femoral artery prosthetic grafts (4 mm diameter x 7 cm; 1 polytetrafluoroethylene and 1 Dacron) were implanted. Patency was determined after 1 week. Dogs were classified before operation according to their epinephrine-enhanced arachidonate-stimulated platelet aggregation response. Polytetrafluoroethylene and Dacron graft patency rates were equivalent in all groups. Overall graft patency was significantly improved from 42% (control) to 94% by both high-dose aspirin and thromboxane receptor antagonist (p less than 0.001). Aspirin-dipyridamole also improved patency (83%; p less than 0.01 versus control), whereas thromboxane synthase inhibitor and low-dose aspirin were not effective. Baseline platelet aggregation was not predictive of patency. The drugs that promoted graft patency in this model either suppressed both thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 formation (high-dose aspirin) or blocked their combined platelet receptor (thromboxane receptor antagonist). Thromboxane synthase inhibitor may be ineffective because prostaglandin H2 production is allowed. These data suggest that activation of the platelet thromboxane A2-prostaglandin H2 receptor is an essential event in early arterial graft thrombosis.\r"

In an effort to improve cell attachment, numerous investigators have used fibronectin as a coating material to pretreat the luminal surfaces of these prostheses. The concentrations of fibronectin used have varied enormously, and no one has yet determined the most efficient concentration in terms of cell attachment and cost. Using endothelial cells labeled with indium 111 oxine we have studied the effect of varying fibronectin concentration on the attachment of these cells onto polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts. Seeding efficiency was significantly better in all groups of coated grafts, at all times (10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes), compared to uncoated controls (p less than 0.01). Overall, fibronectin at a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml was found to be the most efficient in terms of cell attachment and cost since any further increase in concentration was not accompanied by increased cell attachment. We now routinely use fibronectin at a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml to coat our grafts before endothelial cell seeding.\r"

All other outflow patterns were considered poor. The cumulative 1-year patency rate was 61% with a 79% limb salvage rate after reoperations performed in limbs with good runoff. In reoperations with poor runoff, the patency rate was only 5% with a 22% limb salvage rate. In reoperations with good runoff, and 85% patency rate of vein grafts compared to 43% of prosthetic grafts clearly demonstrated the importance of graft material on early outcome.

  ".W": "Endothelial cell seeding methods might reduce the high failure rates of venous vascular prostheses, but low flow rates in venous vascular prostheses impose a need to protect early patency and to attain early endothelial cell coverage without waiting several weeks for relatively small endothelial cell innocula from autologous veins to form confluent linings. To obtain large number of autologous endothelial cells for high-density seeding, canine omental microvascular endothelial cells were harvested by collagenase digestion and density gradient centrifugation, with yields of 1.34 +/- 0.24 (SD) X 10(6) cells/gm of omentum (N = 8 harvests). Primary culture of a subfraction from each harvest showed the cell population to be dominated by factor VIII-related antigen-positive endothelial cells with only a few nonstaining cells (estimated to be 10% or less of total cell number) visible. Freshly harvested omental cells were seeded onto double velour knitted Dacron prostheses at densities of 5 X 10(5) cells/cm2 of graft luminal surface in an autologous plasma suspension by use of prior preclotting with cell-free autologous plasma, followed by endothelial cell seeding in autologous plasma, with plasma recalcification during endothelial cell instillation. Six seeded and two control (sham-seeded) vascular prostheses 5 cm long with 10 mm inner diameter were used as inferior vena cava interposition grafts. A distal arteriovenous fistula and aspirin (300 mg) and dipyridamole (50 mg orally every day) starting 3 days before surgery were used to protect early patency of all grafts. Seeded venous vascular prostheses were explanted for study at intervals of 1,5, and 10 days after surgery (N = 2 prostheses at each time); the two control venous vascular prostheses were explanted at 10 days. All venous vascular prostheses were patent at time of removal. In seeded venous vascular prostheses, light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy showed emergence of numerous flattened endothelial cell-like cells on the luminal surface 24 hours after surgery, followed by formation of a confluent cellular lining without adherent platelets by 5 to 10 days after surgery. Control venous vascular prostheses, in contrast, remained covered by an irregularly thickened fibrin and red cell thrombus, which sometimes encroached on the lumen. Our results suggest that (1) omental tissue can furnish endothelial cells for high-density immediate seeding of venous vascular prostheses, and (2) that the method we used to combine features of both so-called high density \"seeding\" and \"sodding\" techniques offers both more rapid prosthesis coverage than the former and shorter intraoperative times for cell attachment to prostheses than the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Total macroscopic tumor clearance was achieved in 26 of these 108 patients. Fourteen patients with total tumor excision at primary laparotomy remain in complete clinical remission a minimum of 36 months after diagnosis, but the median progression-free interval for the other two groups was 9 and 17 months, respectively.

Immunohistochemical study revealed that keratin, which was detected in 92% of the biphasic and 57% of the monophasic tumors, was a more sensitive marker of epithelial differentiation than EMA or CEA. The overall 5-year survival of the patients was 64%. Male sex, older age, presence of tumor necrosis, monophasic pattern, and absence of keratin positivity had an unfavourable effect on survival but lacked statistical significance. Survival was significantly lower in patients with tumors exhibiting more than 15 mitoses per 10 HPF (P less than .02) and in those with tumors showing necrosis and a mitotic rate greater than 5 mitoses per 10 HPF (P less than .005).\r"

  ".U": "90339858\r", 
  ".W": "The follow-up results of surgical procedures for cancer of the pancreas at three affiliated hospitals during the past 15 years (1974-1989) were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the merit of pancreatectomy in surgical treatment of advanced stages of this disease. Included were 4 cases of stage I, 14 cases of stage II, 19 cases of stage III, 43 cases of localized stage IV, and 35 cases of generalized stage IV. Pancreatectomy was performed in 67 cases; 100%, 92.9%, 89.5%, 67.4%, and 11.4% of the stage I, II, III, localized IV, and generalized IV cases, respectively. For the localized stage IV cases, in which the cancerous lesions were advanced but limited to the peripancreatic region, 29 pancreatectomies, 12 bypass operations, and 2 exploratory laparotomies were performed. This group included 17 curative and 12 noncurative pancreatectomies. The 50% survival periods were 257 days after curative pancreatectomy, 226 days after noncurative pancreatectomy, 120 days after bypass operation, and 33 days after exploratory laparotomy. The difference in overall survival rate between curative and noncurative pancreatectomies was not significant. The overall survival rates after both curative and noncurative pancreatectomies were significantly higher than the rate after bypass operation. The postoperative physical performance status after pancreatectomy was significantly better than after the palliative procedures. No significant difference in the status was found between patients after standard and extended pancreatectomies. There was no significant difference in the survival rates or the physical performance status between the pancreatectomy group and the palliative surgery group for the generalized stage IV cases, in which the cancerous lesions extended beyond the peripancreatic region. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that pancreatectomy extends the postoperative survival period without impairment of the physical performance status in patients with advanced cancer of the pancreas. Even when the pancreatectomy proves to be a noncurative resection, this aggressive surgical approach may be of benefit to this group of patients. It should be noted, however, that pancreatectomy is not beneficial to patients whose lesions have already become generalized.\r"

One xenograft derived from a cell line showed a marked, but stable, increase in DNA content over the original human carcinoma. Two of the 3 cell lines were DNA aneuploid, and at least 1 line was apparently derived from a minor subpopulation in the original carcinoma. The possible mechanisms and implications of these changes are discussed.\r"

Histologically, local recurrence correlated with the finding of more than ten mitotic figures per ten high-power fields, marked cellularity, prominent nuclear pleomorphism, and stromal overgrowth. Older patients and patients with larger tumors had a higher probability of local recurrence. Stromal overgrowth correlated with the other histological parameters, with rapid tumor growth, a tumor diameter of over 10 cm, and with local recurrence. It was thus considered to be a histological indicator of the malignant potential of phyllodes tumor of the breast.\r"

The indication(s) for radiotherapy included positive margins (42%), advanced local tumor (37%), positive nodes (33%), or high grade histology (48%). Overall actuarial local control at 5 years was 73%, being 100% for T1, 83% for T2, 80% for T3, and 43% for T4. Actuarial survival at 5 years was 80% for T1, 83% for T2, 60% for T3, and 48% for T4. Patients with positive nodes (N+) did worse than those with negative nodes (No), with locoregional control and survival at 5 years being 58% vs. 83%, (P = 0.025) and 38% vs. 80% (P = less than .01), respectively. We found no need for contralateral neck treatment even for those with positive nodes. Also, to date, none of eight patients with adenoid cystic histology has failed locally, as opposed to three of eight failures in patients treated with surgery alone. We believe that post-operative irradiation provides excellent locoregional control for appropriate patients with malignant tumors of major salivary glands.\r"

Fine needle aspiration for cytologic evaluation was performed on 14 patients suspected of having umbilical metastasis. The site of the primary tumor was known in 12 patients. In nine patients with previously documented malignancy, FNA of the umbilical nodule demonstrated malignant cells compatible with the histologic diagnosis of the primary cancer. In five other patients metastatic umbilical nodule was the first or the only sign for the presence of primary cancer elsewhere and in four of them FNA revealed malignant cells prior to the diagnosis of internal carcinoma. In one case, FNA demonstrated only inflammatory cells while surgery revealed adenocarcinoma associated with inflammation. The sensitivity of FNA in diagnosing malignant umbilical nodule, and the accuracy of FNA findings were 98.2%, while the predictive value of a FNA cytologic finding of malignancy was 100%. It is recommended that an umbilical nodule should alert the clinician to the possibility of malignancy and FNA should be performed as the first diagnostic procedure. This safe, rapid, reliable, and inexpensive method may diagnose malignancy and preclude the need for umbilical biopsy or more complicated diagnostic intervention.\r"

In most cases, neutropenic enterocolitis is a self-limited condition, but complications of transmural intestinal necrosis and bowel perforation may occur in a small number of patients. Surgical management should be reserved for those patients with bowel wall necrosis or perforation; however, early identification of these patients is difficult. We report our experience with the use of diagnostic peritoneal lavage in three patients with the symptoms and signs of neutropenic enterocolitis. In each case, Gram's stain of lavage fluid revealed no evidence of polymicrobial contamination of the peritoneal cavity. All three patients were managed medically, with resolution of their abdominal symptoms. Peritoneal lavage is helpful in excluding bowel perforation and avoiding unnecessary surgical intervention in patients with neutropenic enterocolitis.\r"

Obtaining reliable audiologic thresholds in a young child with sudden or early-onset hearing loss can be challenging. This study examines the accuracy with which auditory brainstem response evaluation can predict unaided and aided behavioral thresholds in a child with severe-to-profound hearing loss. Reliable behavioral thresholds were obtained on 119 children who had no measurable click-evoked auditory brainstem responses at instrumentation limits of 100 dB HLn. These data show that an absent auditory brainstem response at 100 dB HLn does not necessarily indicate the absence of measurable unaided hearing for test frequencies ranging from 250 Hz to 4000 Hz. Average aided thresholds of better than 60 dB were present in 43% of the children for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz and in 53% for 500 and 1000 Hz. Therefore, the absence of a click-evoked auditory brainstem response at 100 dB HLn in a young child is not prima facie evidence of the child's cochlear implant candidacy.\r"

Fourteen of these patients had originally undergone sphenoethmoidectomies, 8 had endoscopic sinus surgeries, 6 had Caldwell-Luc operations, and 6 had intranasal antrostomies. Computed tomography scan was instrumental in correctly identifying the site and reasons for failure and assisted in localizing further surgical intervention to the appropriate sites in 30 patients. The indications for computed tomography and revision surgery are discussed and defined.\r"

The fourth approach, alotomy with posterior septal dissection, is described here. The advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed, as are the complications of transseptal surgery. A working knowledge of the various transseptal approaches to the pituitary is imperative for the otolaryngologist who participates in pituitary surgery.\r"

These two previously unreported observations might have significance and value in establishing guidelines for preoperative prognostic predictions of success.\r"

  ".W": "Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma infrequently invades the upper aerodigestive tract. However, when invasion occurs it is the source of significant morbidity and excess mortality. The most common structures invaded by thyroid carcinoma are the recurrent laryngeal nerves, larynx, pharynx, and esophagus, which can produce symptoms of airway insufficiency, dysphagia, and hemoptysis. Locally invasive thyroid carcinoma can often be successfully treated while preserving function of the upper airway. If the tumor involves only the wall of the larynx or trachea without intraluminal extension, \"shaving\" the tumor from the trachea or larynx will produce local control rates comparable to more radical and destructive procedures. Intraluminal extension is a more serious problem that usually requires resection of a portion of the aerodigestive tract. Even in this situation, partial laryngeal or tracheal resection with preservation of function might be possible and should be used. Adjuvant therapy using radioiodine or external beam radiotherapy should be considered an integral part of any treatment plan for these tumors. These modalities will significantly reduce the rate of local recurrence and control symptomatic local disease.\r"

Two patients have died of unrelated disease and two were lost to follow-up, but the remainder are alive without disease 2 months to 12 years following initial diagnosis. We believe that cystic metastases from tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas have often been mistaken for either primary squamous cell carcinomas of branchiogenic origin or with branchial cleft cysts. The distinctive histological features of cystic metastases reviewed after its correct identification can lead to the discovery of an unsuspected primary lesion and result in specific treatment options.\r"

  ".U": "90339940\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies demonstrated that the cationic, mitochondrial-specific dye Rhodamine-123 (Rh-123), is an efficient tumor photosensitizer for Argon laser treatment of human cancer cells both in vitro and in tumors grown as xenografts in athymic mice. To demonstrate the photodynamic mechanism of action of this reaction, the intracellular role of oxygen and temperature changes in treated cells have to be defined. In the current study, a large panel of human tumor cell lines of diverse histologic origin were tested for in vitro sensitivity to Rh-123 and the Argon laser (514.5 nm) in oxygen, deuterium oxide (D2O), and nitrogen (N2) environment. Tumor cells in suspension were first sensitized to Rh-123 (1 or 20 micrograms/ml for 1 hour), cooled on ice to 4 degrees C, and then exposed to the Argon laser (delta T = 14 +/- 1 degree C). Cell proliferation measured by [3H]-thymidine uptake 24 hours after sensitization with Rh-123 and laser treatment was significantly decreased in tumor cells kept in oxygen and D2O atmospheres. No decrease in DNA synthesis was seen in Rh-123 and laser treated cells kept in an N2 environment. Control tumor cells treated with Rh-123 or the Argon laser separately did not show any decreased [3H]-thymidine uptake in oxygen, D2O or N2 environment. These results provide evidence of a photodynamic process since Rh-123 sensitization and Argon laser activation occur at nonthermal levels of energy and are oxygen dependent. The high effectiveness of this technique of photodynamic therapy with the Argon laser, and low toxicity of Rh-123 could make its clinical use very attractive for the treatment of superficial malignancies.\r"

Standard treatments have not been entirely satisfactory. The authors propose to apply a concept of selective nerve activity blockage, which leaves normal contractions undisturbed, as the basis for suppression of laryngeal spasticity. Single pulses of constant duration and increasing amplitude were injected into specially designed blocking electrodes placed around six recurrent laryngeal nerves (three dogs). Vocal cord adduction was reduced or arrested within given \"windows\" of stimulation levels of the blocking electrodes, while it increased with higher amplitudes when the current was injected via standard bipolar electrodes (controls). Although this study demonstrates the feasibility of blocking action potentials passing along recurrent laryngeal nerves, it might eventually allow control of laryngeal spasm from information taken directly from the affected musculature.\r"

Seven of 10 cases were initially treated using irradiation and achieved complete tumor control for a mean of 67 months (range = 23-107 months). Two patients, one treated surgically and the other by embolization, had recurrences and were salvaged by radiation, and neither has recurred. The final patient is disease-free 9 months after embolization and surgery. There have been no serious sequelae of treatment. We conclude that moderate-dose irradiation can safely control most temporal bone paragangliomas.\r"

Glucocorticoids increase net protein degradation in muscle; associated with this increased breakdown of muscle protein is an elevated rate of BCAA oxidation. The effects of glucocorticoids on skeletal muscle BCKAD were investigated in different rat models. BCKAD was activated after glucocorticoid treatment (both acutely, within 2 h, and chronically). The amount of enzyme per muscle cell increased after 5 d of cortisone acetate treatment. Insulin administration partially blocked the acute effects of glucocorticoids on muscle BCKAD. Activation was also observed during metabolic acidosis, insulinopenic diabetes mellitus, and endotoxic shock, three conditions characterized by elevated circulating glucocorticoids, increased BCAA oxidation, and increased net protein breakdown. Activation of BCKAD may account for the increased oxidation of BCAA observed during hypercortisolemia. The sequelae of this accelerated catabolism may include increased glutamine and alanine production for gluconeogenesis and provision of ATP for muscle work.\r"

E training was six to eight 3-min bouts of cycle ergometer exercise at 90-100% VO2max. B-4 d (25%) increased leg press 1 RM more (P less than 0.05) than A-2 d (13%), but the groups increased similarly (A-2 d, B-4 d) in knee extensor (31%, 34%) and flexor (12%, 14%) cross-sectional area and vastus lateralis mean fiber area (33%, 25%).

CS activity increased significantly only in A-2 d (26%; B-4 d, 6%).

The plantarflexor muscles were shown to provide an anti-shear mechanism at the ankle and an anti-shear, anti-bending mechanism within the lower leg. Simple sensitivity analyses were performed on the models to display possible variability in the peak load estimates.\r"

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of height (three), distance (three), and technique (three) on impact forces during landings. Three male volunteer subjects were filmed while performing three right foot landings onto a force platform for each combination of height, distance, and technique for a total of 81 trials per subject. Between- and within-subject three-way ANOVAs and three regression models (mechanical, biomechanical, refined biomechanical) were computed on the dependent variables of first (F1) and second (F2) maximum vertical force. Results of the between-subject ANOVAs indicated significant (P less than 0.05) height, distance, and technique main effects for F1 and a height x technique interaction for F2. The within-subject ANOVA results identified unique models for each of the three subjects. The biomechanical regression model exhibited the best predictions of F1 and F2 for S1 (81.0 and 72.0% explained variance, respectively), while the refined biomechanical model accounted for 83.4, 81.3, 80.9, and 88.0% of the F1 and F2 variances for S2 and S3, respectively. In conclusion, the within-subject results identified unique individual landing strategies that were masked by the group analyses suggesting that caution be exercised in using between-subject analysis techniques.\r"

A motion analysis system and two force platforms were used to examine the STS task among 10 healthy adults at each of three self-selected speeds. As the speed of ascent became faster, a progressively earlier time to the maximum vertical linear momentum and an increase in its magnitude occurred. In contrast, a relatively constant time to the maximum linear momentum, which was also the time when the propulsive impulse became the braking impulse, was found in the horizontal direction, and the propulsive impulse showed a disproportionately (1:3) smaller increase from slow to fast speeds than its vertical counterpart. The relative invariance in the horizontal motion suggested that different neuromuscular control strategies may have been employed in the horizontal and vertical directions to accomplish the different tasks of balance control in one direction and changing the gravitational potential energy in the other direction.\r"

Shrinkage induced by various physical activities may be reversed using gravity inversion. The present purpose was to examine the shrinkage induced by a drop jumping regimen and evaluate gravity inversion post-exercise. Eight males, aged 20-31, performed two separate experimental protocols, each on different dates at 1400 h. Subjects stood for 30 min before undertaking an exercise regimen, consisting of five sets of five drop jumps from a height of 1 m, rebounding over a hurdle 0.5 m high. For 20 min, directly following the exercise regimen, subjects on one occasion stood and on a second occasion undertook gravity inversion. Shrinkage was monitored for 40 min after this post-exercise treatment. The stadiometer used to measure shrinkage was accurate to 0.05 mm. The exercise regimen caused a mean shrinkage of 1.68 and 1.81 mm for the two testing sessions. Post-exercise inversion and standing for 20 min increased stature by 5.18 and 0.76 mm, respectively (P less than 0.01). The 40-min standing period following inversion caused a rapid loss in stature (4.07 mm). At 30 min into this recovery period, there was no significant difference in shrinkage for either of the regimens. Results suggest that effects of an inversion treatment are short-lasting.\r"

Heart rates and oxygen uptakes were measured during the last minute of each bout, ratings of perceived exertion were requested immediately after each bout, and capillary blood lactate concentrations were determined 3 min after each bout. The double pole technique was found to be significantly more economical (P less than 0.05) than the other techniques, as demonstrated by a 12% lower oxygen consumption. No differences were found between the V1 skate and the kick double pole techniques for any of the variables studied. The findings of similar physiological responses with the V1 skate and kick double pole techniques suggest that these techniques should induce similar cardiovascular adaptations when roller skiing at the same speed on flat terrain.\r"

The CR and VR groups trained 2 to 3 d.wk-1 for 10 wk. Subjects completed one set of full ROM (120 to 0 degrees of flexion) bilateral knee extensions with an amount of weight that allowed 8 to 12 repetitions during each training session. For the VR group, resistance was varied with a cam supplied by the manufacturer (Nautilus). For the CR group, the cam was removed and replaced with a round sprocket. Prior to and after training, maximal voluntary isometric torque was measured at 9, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 degrees of knee flexion. Analysis of covariance indicated that the VR and CR groups gained strength at all angles (P less than or equal to 0.05) when compared to the control. [table: see text] There was no difference (P greater than 0.05) between the CR and VR groups at any angle, and the magnitude of strength gained was similar (P greater than 0.05) among angles for both groups. These data indicate that both CR and VR knee extension training elicit full ROM strength development.\r"

The gross efficiency is defined as the ratio of the power output (W) to the power input (W). In a range of swimming velocities (0.95-1.6 m.s-1), the power input (rate of energy expenditure, 445-1137 W) was calculated from the oxygen uptake values (1.33-3.25 1 O2.min-1). The total power output (26-108 W) was directly measured during front crawl swimming using a system of underwater push-off pads instrumented with a force transducer (MAD-system). Using the MAD-system, the effect on total body drag due to the addition of the respiratory apparatus was evaluated to be negligible. The gross efficiency ranged from 5 to 9.5%. At equal swimming speed, the male competitive swimmers demonstrated a higher gross efficiency. However, this was due to the higher power output required by the male swimmers at a given speed. Gross efficiency was dependent on the absolute power output such that as power output increased so did the calculated gross efficiency. At the same power output, the values for the gross efficiency do not differ between the male and female competitive swimmers.\r"

  ".W": "Two highly trained groups, competitive swimmers (N = 6) and triathletes (N = 5), were compared to evaluate the significance of the propelling efficiency as a performance determining factor in swimming. Using regression equations, the groups were compared at equal power input (1000 W). The groups did not differ in gross efficiency, stroke frequency, and work per stroke. There was a difference in distance per stroke (1.23 m vs 0.92 m) and mean swimming velocity (1.17 m.s-1) vs 0.95 m.s-1). The difference in swimming speed between the two groups can be explained by the fact that the competitive swimmers used a much higher proportion of their power output to overcome drag (49 W vs 35 W). At the same time, the competitive swimmers expended less power in moving water backwards (32 W vs 45 W). This difference in apportionment of the power output was characterized as the propelling efficiency (power used to overcome drag/total power output). Mean (+/- SD) propelling efficiency for the competitive swimmers was 61 +/- 6% but was only 44 +/- 3% for the triathletes. The results suggest that on average the better swimmer distinguishes himself from the poorer one by a greater distance per stroke rather than a higher stroke frequency. It is concluded that triathletes should focus their attention on their swimming technique rather than their ability to do work. The distance per stroke might be a simple criterion to evaluate the improvement in skill.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Nephropathic cystinosis causes renal failure in most patients at approximately 10 years of age. This can be prevented or retarded by cystine-depleting therapy with oral cysteamine. Many patients who do not receive adequate cysteamine therapy undergo renal transplantation, but the accumulation of cystine continues in other organs, resulting in various clinical abnormalities. We report age-related swallowing dysfunction in patients with nephropathic cystinosis. METHODS. We studied 43 patients with cystinosis (24 who had received a renal transplant and 19 who had not), 3 to 31 years of age. Oral motor function was assessed by a cranial-nerve oral sensorimotor examination, and an oral motor index was calculated for each patient. The oral phase of swallowing was assessed by ultrasonography, and the pharyngeal and esophageal phases were evaluated by videofluoroscopy. RESULTS. Approximately half the patients were slow eaters. Oral motor dysfunction, reflected by a higher oral motor index, increased with age. Speech, oral structure and anatomy, and tongue and lip strength were particularly affected. Seven of nine patients 21 to 31 years old had abnormalities in all three phases of swallowing; the deficits were variable in younger patients. In 28 patients with cystinosis, the mean (+/- SD) duration of oropharyngeal swallowing for a dry swallow (3.06 +/- 1.06 seconds) was longer than in 14 normal subjects (1.89 +/- 0.57 seconds; P less than 0.001). This prolongation reflected impairment of the initiation phase of swallowing. CONCLUSIONS. Swallowing dysfunction is a late complication of nephropathic cystinosis, probably related to muscular dysfunction. Changes in the consistency of foods, swallowing exercises, and long-term cysteamine therapy should be considered for patients with cystinosis who have difficulty in swallowing.\r"

To optimize this treatment approach and define the in vivo distribution and survival of TIL, we used retroviral-mediated gene transduction to introduce the gene coding for resistance to neomycin into human TIL before their infusion into patients--thus using the new gene as a marker for the infused cells. RESULTS. Five patients received the gene-modified TIL. All the patients tolerated the treatment well, and no side effects due to the gene transduction were noted. The presence and expression of the neomycin-resistance gene were demonstrated in TIL from all the patients with Southern blot analysis and enzymatic assay for the neomycin phosphotransferase coded by the bacterial gene. Cells from four of the five patients grew successfully in high concentrations of G418, a neomycin analogue otherwise toxic to eukaryotic cells. With polymerase-chain-reaction analysis, gene-modified cells were consistently found in the circulation of all five patients for three weeks and for as long as two months in two patients. Cells were recovered from tumor deposits as much as 64 days after cell administration. The procedure was safe according to all criteria, including the absence of infections virus in TIL and in the patients. CONCLUSIONS. These studies demonstrate the feasibility and safety of using retroviral gene transduction for human gene therapy and have implications for the design of TIL with improved antitumor potency, as well as for the possible use of lymphocytes for the gene therapy of other diseases.\r"

Patients with the nephrotic syndrome characteristically have multiple abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism, but the cause and exact nature of these abnormalities are uncertain. In this study, we measured serum lipids and apoproteins in 57 patients with the nephrotic syndrome. We also determined the kinetic indexes of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism in six patients, and again in three of the six after recovery. RESULTS. The patients with the nephrotic syndrome had elevated serum concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, which were confined to the lipoproteins containing apoprotein B. The serum concentrations of high-density lipoproteins and the associated A-I and A-II apoproteins were similar in the patients with the nephrotic syndrome and normal subjects. The relative proportions of lipids and their positive association with the increased serum concentrations of apoproteins B, C-II, C-III, and E suggest quantitative rather than qualitative differences in the lipoproteins. All the patients had lipiduria, which probably reflected the excretion of high-density lipoproteins, although no intact immunoreactive apoprotein A-I was found in urine. Serum albumin concentrations were inversely related to serum lipid concentrations in the patients, the severity of the hypoalbuminemia corresponding to the degree of change in serum lipoprotein concentrations. The kinetic studies of lipoprotein metabolism revealed an overproduction of LDL apoprotein B that returned to normal after recovery. CONCLUSIONS. The elevated serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol, other lipids, and apoprotein B in patients with uncomplicated nephrotic syndrome are due to reversible increases in lipoprotein production.\r"

Exact estimates of the length of survival for mentally retarded persons at especially high risk are not available, however. METHODS. We collected data on mortality and other factors for 99,543 persons with developmental disabilities, including mental retardation, who received services from the California Department of Developmental Services between March 1984 and October 1987. Three subgroups were selected on the basis of the four characteristics identified in previous studies as the best predictors of mortality among mentally retarded people (deficits in cognitive function, limitations on mobility, incontinence, and inability to eat without assistance). In all three subgroups, the subjects had severe deficits in cognitive function and were incontinent; the subjects in subgroup 1 (n = 1550) were immobile and required tube feeding; those in subgroup 2 (n = 4513) were immobile but could eat with assistance; those in subgroup 3 (n = 997) were mobile (but not ambulatory) and could eat with assistance. Life tables were generated for each of the three subgroups. RESULTS. Immobile subjects were found to have a much shorter life expectancy than those who could move about. Those who also required tube feeding (subgroup 1) had a very short life expectancy (i.e., four to five additional years). Those who could eat if fed by others (subgroup 2) had an average life expectancy of approximately eight additional years. In contrast, those who were mobile though not ambulatory (subgroup 3) had a life expectancy of about 23 additional years. CONCLUSIONS. Severe mental retardation is associated with a decrease in life expectancy, particularly for those who were immobile.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulating coil used in extracranial magnetic field stimulation (EMFS) emits a high intensity impulse sound artifact that causes permanent threshold shifts in the unprotected ears of experimental animals. At magnetic stimulation levels of 50 to 100%, the magnetic coil acoustic artifact (MCAA) ranged from 145 to 157 dB peak sound pressure level at the eardrum. The magnetic field alone did not appear to cause hearing impairment since no threshold shifts were observed in ears that were plugged with ear protectors during exposure to the MCAA. These findings suggest that the acoustic artifact produced by EMFS in the clinic may pose some risk for hearing loss in patients and clinicians when held in close proximity to the unprotected ear. We recommend the use of ear protectors for the patient and clinician during EMFS as a precautionary measure to prevent hearing loss.\r"

Among idiopathic cases, a sibling with epilepsy, a generalized spike and wave EEG, or a history of acute symptomatic seizure increased risk for recurrence. Among remote symptomatic cases, status epilepticus, a prior acute symptomatic seizure, or Todd's paresis increased risk. Depending upon clinical features, recurrence risk at 5 years following a 1st seizure ranged from 23% to 80%. Treatment with anticonvulsant medication was not associated with a decrease in recurrence risks.\r"

The common denominator for these and the 16 others reported in the literature appears to be activity related to function of the parietal lobe. The clinical and EEG findings in all 25 patients support the diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy. Seizures usually start during adolescence and consist of myoclonus, absences, and generalized convulsions. Specific inquiry about reflex activation should be carried out in patients with generalized epilepsy since this is rarely provided spontaneously. Attacks could be controlled satisfactorily in 89% of our patients. The genetic features are those of a primary generalized epileptic disorder without evidence for a specific inheritance of reflex sensitivity. Neuropsychological analysis of the stimuli points to parietal cortical dysfunction. These stimuli lead to activation of a generalized epileptic process analogous to the occipital cortical participation in the activation of generalized epileptic abnormality occurring in patients with photosensitive epilepsy.\r"

We studied 48 patients who presented with cerebral or visual dysfunction associated with APLAb to help clarify the diagnostic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and pathologic features in these patients. Most patients presented with transient cerebral ischemia or cerebral infarction. Recurrent and stereotypic events were frequent. Visual disturbances resulted from amaurosis fugax, retinal arterial or venous occlusion, occipital ischemia, diplopia, and migraine-like disturbances. Three patients presented with severe atypical classic migraine. Recurrent infarcts of brain and eye were significantly associated with the presence of cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and a positive antinuclear antibody. During 44.4 patient-years of prospective follow-up, the combined stroke and systemic thrombotic event rate was 0.27 events per patient-year and was 0.54 events per patient-year if TIA and death were included. Forty (83%) of the patients did not have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Thrombocytopenia was present in 15 (31%) and a false-positive VDRL in 11 (23%) of the patients. Cerebral angiography was normal or revealed large-vessel occlusion or stenosis without changes suggestive of vasculitis. Patients with only transient dysfunction generally had normal radiologic studies, including angiography. Organs and arterial vessels studied pathologically revealed thrombotic occlusive disease without vasculitis. APLAb are strongly associated with an immune-mediated thrombotic tendency, generally in the absence of SLE. Other stroke risk factors may add to the risk of recurrent ischemic events in patients with APLAb.\r"

Seven patients suffering distal pial MCA branch occlusion developed a pattern of internal borderzone infarction on follow-up CT. Carotid artery or carotid siphon stenosis or occlusion was absent in all seven. Proximal MCA branch occlusions, prior to the origin of the lenticulostriate arteries, were associated with extensive cortical and deep infarction in the entire MCA territory in 14 patients. There was proximal carotid artery or siphon stenosis or occlusion in 12 of these 14 patients. The remaining 15 patients showed a mixture of proximal and distal MCA occlusions and patchy ischemic damage in the MCA territory. There were no cases of superficial cortical watershed infarction. These data show that internal borderzone infarctions may result from intracranial MCA branch occlusions alone and need not be associated with hemodynamic alterations due to large vessel extracranial disease.\r"

Characteristic manifestations include cortical sensory loss, focal reflex myoclonus, \"alien limb\" phenomena, apraxia, rigidity and akinesia, a postural-action tremor, limb dystonia, hyperreflexia, and postural instability. The asymmetry of symptoms and signs is often striking. Brain imaging may demonstrate greater abnormalities contralateral to the more affected side. Postmortem studies in 2 patients revealed the characteristic pathologic features of swollen, poorly staining (achromatic) neurons and degeneration of cerebral cortex and substantia nigra. Biochemical analysis of 1 brain showed a severe, diffuse loss of dopamine in the striatum. This condition is more frequent than previously believed, and the diagnosis can be predicted during life on the basis of clinical findings. However, as with other \"degenerative\" diseases of the nervous system, a definitive diagnosis of cortical-basal ganglionic degeneration requires confirmation by autopsy.\r"

In univariate tests, age, certain items of the Webster scale, the Hoehn and Yahr scale, a 10-question mental status questionnaire, and a history of smoking were associated with a diagnosis of dementia 3 1/2 years later. Logistic regression with DSM III-R diagnosis (demented versus nondemented) as the dependent variable, and age and symptom scales for PD as predictor variables, revealed that PD symptoms predicted dementia even after controlling for age. We conclude that dementia is probably more common in PD patients than would be expected in the general population and is associated with the severity of PD symptoms and signs independently of age.\r"

In all cases, scores on the 3 tests were highly correlated with each other. Examination of the annual rate of change (ARC) in score for the 2-year subgroup revealed an average decline of -3.24 error points on the IMC, 2.81 points on the MMSE, and 11.38 points on the DRS. Of the 3 tests, only the DRS evidenced greater sensitivity to change with increasing dementia severity. In the 3-year subgroup, the ARC between years 1 and 2 was not correlated with ARC between years 2 and 3 for any of the 3 tests. This finding suggests that a patient's rate of progression in 1 year may bear little relationship to future rate of decline.\r"

The median time from the initial motor symptoms to total paralysis was longer (45 days) in the patients who recovered compared with those permanently paralyzed (9 days). The response to radiation therapy seems to depend on the rate of loss of spinal cord function rather than the length of total paralysis. We recommend active treatment of patients with paraplegia due to metastatic epidural spinal cord compression, even when the paralysis has been present for over a week.\r"

They were clinically typical, and the CSF pressure and protein were elevated but the neuroimaging abnormalities were so subtle that they were originally overlooked.

After dividing the patients into 2 groups, those with and without autonomic dysfunction or extrapyramidal signs, we found that those with these manifestations also had pontine atrophy, a later onset and shorter duration of the disease, and impairment of higher brain functions. The group without these manifestations had relatively normal pontine volume, a greater familial tendency for cerebellar degeneration, and longer duration of the disease. Our results suggest that quantitative volume evaluation of the pons by CT is important for the clinical categorization of cerebellar degeneration.\r"

Teased-fiber analysis indicated the globule-like changes (Dyck's G change) to be accompanied by the formation of adjacent demyelinated segments. The globules result from slowly repetitive degenerative changes of myelin and are considered to be a form of demyelination. However, they have seldom been found in other demyelinating neuropathies, indicating the demyelination process with globule formation in HAM to be rather specific for this disease.\r"

This made it possible to isolate and separately assess perceptual and premotor factors of the disorder. Comparison of experimental and radiologic data suggested that premotor factors were more pronounced in patients with lesions involving the frontal lobes than in patients with lesions confined to postrolandic areas. The technique employed is compatible with bedside examination and provides data useful for standard assessment of neglect symptomatology for both clinical and experimental purposes.\r"

The infant with pseudo-Zellweger's syndrome also had very low levels of 22:6 omega 3 and of the ratio 22:6 omega 3/22:5 omega 3 in all tissues, especially in the brain, where the index 22:5 omega 6/22:4 omega 6 was also very significantly reduced. The ratio 22:6 omega 3/22:4 omega 6 was markedly decreased in all tissues, in Zellweger's as well as in pseudo-Zellweger's syndrome.

  ".W": "Left visual field (LVF) extinction during double simultaneous stimulation (DSS) is common in patients with right cerebral lesions. A postulate is that during DSS, the intact left hemisphere's limited attentional capacity is directed to right hemispace, resulting in LVF extinction. External cueing may help direct attention to the LVF and improve performance. In the present study, we varied patterns of unilateral stimulation preceding DSS in an attempt to redirect attention through expectancy. Nine patients (7 stroke, 2 tumor) with right hemisphere lesions each had 40 DSS trials with the distribution of unilateral stimulation trials systematically varied. Mean extinction percentages on DSS trials were 17% following 5 right unilateral trials, 30% following 1 right unilateral trial, 52% following 1 left unilateral trial, and 63% following 5 left unilateral trials. These findings indicate that the probability of extinction decreases following unilateral stimulation to the right visual field and increases following unilateral stimulation to the LVF. These results suggest that expectancy alters the attentional bias which mediates extinction.\r"

Eighteen (15%) of the cases involved white, non-Hispanic women, 66 (55%) were black, and 32 (27%) were Hispanic. Fifty-seven deaths were associated with cesarean delivery, although most of these could not be attributed to the mode of delivery. Sixty-six (55%) of the deaths were classified as direct maternal deaths. The age ranged from 16-44 years, with 83 (69%) of the women aged 20-34, 11 (9%) 19 or less, and 26 (22%) aged 35 or older. Increasing age and parity were associated with greater maternal mortality ratios. The leading causes of pregnancy-associated mortality were found to be ectopic pregnancy, pulmonary embolism, anesthetic complications, amniotic fluid embolism, intracranial hemorrhage, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, infection, and cardiac disease. Abortion-related mortality was about nine times less than the maternal mortality ratio, and the cesarean death-to-case rates could be considered roughly comparable to overall maternal mortality.\r"

Early (before 48 hours) postpartum eclampsia was experienced by 72% of patients, and 28% had late (after 48 hours) postpartum eclampsia. Prospectively only 67% of patients were correctly diagnosed, and retrospectively only 83% could be considered to have had preeclampsia before seizure. Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome was present in 30% of the affected patients. Seven patients were receiving magnesium sulfate by controlled infusion when an eclamptic seizure occurred. The presence or absence of diuresis was unrelated to seizure occurrence. Preeclampsia recurred in 38.5% of subsequent gestations. It appears that HELLP syndrome may be a predisposing factor for eclampsia.\r"

Eight (8.7 per 1000) women were seropositive on repeat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot testing. Two infected women had had heterosexual contact with a person at risk for HIV infection, two others reported \"crack\" cocaine use, and four acknowledged no risk factors. Thirteen percent of seronegative women reported risk factors for HIV infection. Nearly all women consented to HIV testing, and most completed the risk-behavior questionnaire.

In the present study of 123 women with intra-amniotic infection and 6769 women without infection, the mean umbilical artery pH was 7.28 in both groups. The frequency of acidemia (umbilical artery pH less than 7.20) was not significantly different between the infection group and controls (15 versus 10%; P = .12). Likewise, there was no significant difference between the groups when a lower umbilical artery pH value (less than 7.15) was used to define acidemia. None of the infants from infected mothers had metabolic acidemia with a pH of less than 7.15 and none had a pH of less than 7.00. Significantly more (P less than .05) infants in the infected group did have low 1-minute (20 versus 5%) and 5-minute (3 versus 1%) Apgar scores of 6 or less, criteria often used to define asphyxia. However, none of the newborns from the infected group had recently proposed criteria for the diagnosis of birth asphyxia (ie, leading to neurologic impairment) such as metabolic acidemia, seizures in the immediate newborn period, and low Apgar scores (3 or less). Birth asphyxia is rarely associated with intra-amniotic infection, and in the absence of other signs of fetal jeopardy such as an ominous fetal heart rate pattern, an immediate cesarean to prevent asphyxia does not appear justified once the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis is made.\r"

Histologic chorioamnionitis was identified in 51 of 95 study subjects. It was more common in the second trimester (72%) than from 27-34 weeks' gestation (33%) (P less than .001). Culture specimens were obtained for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia. Microorganisms were recovered from 38 subjects; all culture reports were negative in 36. A statistically significant association was demonstrated between histologic chorioamnionitis and positive culture results. If any microorganism was recovered, 68% of the subjects had histologic chorioamnionitis, versus 39% if all cultures were negative. Of cases of histologic chorioamnionitis in the third trimester, 92% were associated with positive cultures, compared with 54% in the second trimester. Our results suggest that histologic chorioamnionitis is not synonymous with infection, especially in the second trimester.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the biophysical profile would be a valuable intrapartum addition to fetal heart rate monitoring in predicting umbilical arterial acid-base status at delivery, 95 patients at term had serial studies during labor and umbilical artery blood gas analysis. There was no significant association between biophysical profile score and cord blood pH, nor was there a difference in scores between the acidemic and nonacidemic groups. Of the five components of the initial biophysical profile, only a nonreactive nonstress test (NST) was associated with both pH 7.20 or less (P = .019) and metabolic acidemia (P = .016). None of the individual variables of the final examination correlated with a pH of 7.20 or less. However, a nonreactive NST was associated with metabolic acidemia (P = .03), as was the presence of breathing (P = .03). Of the ten infants with pH 7.20 or less, eight had an initial and five had a final biophysical profile score of 8 or higher. Of the five whose pH was less than 7.15, four had an initial and three a final score of 8 or more. Finally, of the five with metabolic acidemia, four had an initial and two a final score of 8 or higher. Half of the acidemic fetuses had final biophysical profile scores of 8 or higher, suggesting that this score in labor is not reliable to rule out acidemia at delivery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These pregnancies were compared with all pregnancies delivering at our hospital during the same time period. A retrospective analysis using our perinatal data base examined maternal age, gravidity, parity, race, mode of delivery, birth weight, gestational age at delivery, Apgar scores, and size for gestational age. Within the phenotypically abnormal group, karyotypically normal and abnormal infants showed no significant differences in primary cesarean rates, low Apgar scores, mean birth weight, or appropriateness of size for gestational age. Karyotypically abnormal infants were smaller than the general population (P less than .001) and had lower Apgar scores (P less than .05) but were just as likely to be full-term (66.7 versus 70.3%). These chromosomally abnormal pregnancies had a higher primary cesarean rate than the general population (30.3 versus 15.4%; P less than .001). Black infants undergoing genetic studies had a 37% rate of karyotypic abnormalities, which was significantly higher than the 12.5% rate in the white infants tested (P less than .05). The term black infant with phenotypic abnormalities suggestive of karyotypic abnormalities may be less likely to be recognized and appropriately tested. Increased awareness of phenotypic abnormalities with subsequent genetic testing seems warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Several recent reports have noted an increase risk of breast cancer associated with the use of oral contraceptives (OCs) among various subgroups of young women. These reports spurred us to analyze data from a case-control study in North Carolina of 158 breast cancer patients, 326 hospital controls, and 1140 community controls less than 60 years of age. A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals and to control for potential confounders. No association between ever-use of OCs and the risk of breast cancer was found for cases compared with either control group. No increased risk was observed for OC use before age 25 or before first full-term pregnancy, or in relation to duration of use, recency of use, or time since first use. Analysis of the subgroup of women less than 45 years of age also showed no relationship between OC use and breast cancer risk. However, an elevated risk of breast cancer was observed among nulliparous women with 5 or more years of OC use in comparisons with hospital controls (odds ratio 7.8) and community controls (odds ratio 2.3). This analysis was based on small numbers of subjects and the 95% confidence intervals touched or overlapped with 1. An unexpected association between duration of OC use and breast cancer risk was found among older premenopausal women in comparisons of cases with both control groups. For these women, a trend was evident in the odds ratio by duration of OC use, and the comparison between cases and community controls was statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. Sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. Quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. At enrollment, G vaginalis was recovered from 99%, Bacteroides sp from 94%, Peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and M hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. The vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. The mean log concentration was 1.2 X 10(9) cfu/mL for aerobic and 2.6 X 10(8) cfu/mL for anaerobic bacteria. After treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for G vaginalis, Bacteroides sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, and M hominis. The 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. Treatment with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. Therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of Lactobacillus, and a probably transient increase in the frequency of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results of several European clinical trials have shown both terconazole cream and suppositories to be effective and safe in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. We conducted a comparative placebo-controlled, double-blind study of 0.8 and 1.6% terconazole creams in a group of patients with persistent vulvovaginal candidiasis. In short-term evaluations (1-3 days and 8-11 days after therapy), 75% of patients receiving 0.8% terconazole cream were asymptomatic and 83.3% were mycologically cured. By 30-35 days after therapy, 75% were still asymptomatic and 58.3% were mycologically negative. No significant difference was seen between the results obtained with 0.8 and 1.6% terconazole creams. Safety data collected on these patients demonstrated that the side effects were rare and mild. This study confirms the efficacy and safety of topical terconazole in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the utility and limitations of CA 125 for the early diagnosis of recurrence of ovarian cancer and investigated whether the precision of diagnosis could be enhanced by combining CA 125 with other tumor markers. Of 181 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, 149 were in clinical remission and 35 had developed recurrence. Thirty-four women with recurrence had preoperative CA 125 values of 35 U/mL or more, and 21 (62%) had CA 125 levels of 35 U/mL or more at the time of detection of clinical recurrence. Eleven had levels that remained elevated 3 months before identification of the recurrence. However, in 13 cases CA 125 was below 35 U/mL at the time recurrence was detected. To enhance the efficacy of tumor markers to predict recurrence, patients in whom multiple tumor markers had been measured were studied retrospectively. At the time of clinical recurrence and 3 months earlier, the diagnostic sensitivity of CA 125 alone for recurrence was 64 and 33%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity of a combination of tumor markers (CA 125, CA 19-9, tissue polypeptide antigen, and immunosuppressive acidic protein) was 89 and 66%. Thus, prediction of recurrence of ovarian cancer can be improved by the use of a combination of these tumor markers.\r"

The overall positivity rate of the new marker was 60%, lower than the rate of 88% obtained with CA 125 measured concurrently. Concerning tumor histology, CA 54/61 had a positivity rate of 78% in mucinous adenocarcinoma, compared with 44% with CA 125. There was no correlation between the serum levels of CA 54/61 and CA 125 (r = 0.05). CA 54/61 showed a low rate of positivity in benign disease and only exceeded the cutoff value in one patient with an endometrial cyst, whereas CA 125 had a positivity rate of 60%. The false-positive rates for CA 125 during the first trimester of pregnancy and during menstruation were 57 and 16%, respectively, whereas the rates for CA 54/61 were only 11 and 5%, respectively. Assay of both CA 54/61 and CA 125 increased the success rate in diagnosing ovarian cancer to 95% (38 of 40 patients).\r"

Two hundred fifty-eight menopausal volunteers who were not seeking gynecologic care had CA 125 measured on two occasions and also underwent transvaginal ultrasonography to measure ovarian volumes. Only one subject had a CA 125 level greater than 35 U/mL. The mean value for CA 125 was 5.6 +/- 3.5 U/mL. Within women, the correlation between two tests was very high (r = 0.82). Among women with apparently normal ovaries, CA 125 values were low, tightly distributed, and reproducible; these findings indicate that the test may prove to be useful and cost-effective in a screening program. The correlation between CA 125 values and ovarian volume determined by sonogram was low (r = 0.11). The independence of these two tests would also be desirable in any screening program. Other studies have found normal women to have higher levels of CA 125 with wider distributions than found here; further evaluation of test performance at these low levels is needed.\r"

Tumor tissue from ten of 18 patients with vaginal carcinoma contained HPV DNA. Three of the 18 patients had a history of cervical neoplasia more than 14 years before the diagnosis of vaginal carcinoma. Five of 15 primary squamous cell carcinomas, one primary adenocarcinoma, and a vulvar recurrence of a vaginal squamous carcinoma contained HPV 16. A primary squamous carcinoma yielded HPV-related sequences. The HPV copy number varied from 0.5 to 50 per cellular genome. Four histologically positive inguinal lymph nodes from three patients contained HPV DNA. In six tumor-free control tissues from four patients, no HPV DNA was detected. No relationship was established between HPV positivity, HPV type, or copy number of the tumor and the grade of differentiation or keratinization or the clinical stage. After a median follow-up of 13 months, five of nine HPV-positive patients were alive without recurrence, whereas all seven HPV-negative patients had died because of disease. The results of this study indicate a possible major role of HPV in the development of vaginal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Although most human papillomavirus infections can be managed satisfactorily by office methods, extensive, refractory, and dysplastic vulvar disease poses frustrating problems. This observational cohort study evaluated the efficacy of extended laser ablation (vaporization of both clinically apparent and adjacent subclinical changes) among 160 women drawn from 1000 referrals between 1982-1987. During the final 2 years, the protocol incorporated two different 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) regimens: routine once-weekly applications as prophylaxis against postoperative recurrence, and twice-weekly dosing to avoid further laser surgery among patients with early but diffuse failures. One hundred seven patients (66.9%) were controlled by a single operation. Subsequent therapy for the remaining 53 women involved 44 additional superficial photovaporizations, 38 courses of therapeutic 5-FU, four deep laser destructions with skin grafting, and six trials of systemic alpha-interferon. Eventually, 158 patients (98.7%) entered stable clinical remission. Adjuvant 5-FU improved success rates among the 76 women with two or more adverse prognostic factors (87.5 versus 55.8%; P less than .01) but had no prophylactic value in the other 84 women. In contrast, the therapeutic 5-FU regimen was generally effective, avoiding the need for further surgery in 22 (57.9%) of 38 inevitable failures, compared with only four successes (10.3%) among 39 historic controls managed with caustic agents (chi 2 = 19.5; P less than .001). Improvements in laser technology had no impact upon outcome, but more sophisticated heat containment strategies reduced postoperative pain, healing time, and morbidity. Given adequate technique and an appropriate indication, we find extended laser ablation to be an excellent primary control method. However, the availability of an effective adjuvant regimen would be a valuable complement.\r"

In an effort to identify potential anatomical reasons for this unacceptably high failure rate, 20 patients becoming pregnant after laparoscopic tubal occlusion underwent bilateral salpingectomy. Gross and histologic evaluation of the surgical specimens demonstrated improper application of the occlusive device in all cases. Seventeen patients were found to have nonoccluded or partially occluded tubes on one or both sides, with all occlusive devices located in the infundibular segment. Two patients were missing tubal rings on one side, and the remaining patient had a tubal ring misapplied to the round ligament. Sixteen residents who had completed a 1-month rotation on the ambulatory surgery service were given a standardized interview to assess their knowledge of proper sterilization techniques as well as their training experience. The frequency of incorrect responses given to four specific questions concerning proper placement of the tubal ring and spring-loaded clip ranged from 43.8-81.2%. The sterilization failure rate at this institution appears to be directly related to the resident surgeon's lack of understanding of the operative technique. Realizing that our institution is not unlike most other resident training programs, we developed a standardized education program including formal instruction of residents in proper sterilization technique and have altered supervisory guidelines for attending surgeons.\r"

Four cases of AIDS and P carinii pneumonia complicating pregnancy have been reported in the literature, and all have caused maternal death. We report a case in which the mother survived. Treatment was similar to that used in the other reported cases except that steroids were added. A limited number of patients with AIDS and P carinii infection have been treated with trimethopterim-sulfamethoxazole and steroids, with good results.

Despite lactation, the serum calcium level increased to 15.4 mg/dL 11 days postpartum. We treated two other hypoparathyroid women during four pregnancies with either calcitriol or dihydrotachysterol. In all five pregnancies, requirements for the vitamin D preparations increased beginning at the 20-28th week of gestation. Hypercalcemia did not occur in the two women who did not breast-feed and in whom we reduced the dose of calcitriol or dihydrotachysterol after delivery. We conclude the following: 1) Calcitriol is effective for treating hypoparathyroidism during pregnancy; 2) the dose usually needs to be increased during the latter half of gestation; 3) the calcitriol dose should be reduced during lactation; and 4) both mother and infant should be monitored to detect hypercalcemia during breast-feeding. We speculate that low serum estrogen levels associated with breast-feeding promote bone resorption and diminish calcitriol needs in lactating hypoparathyroid women.\r"

We report the case of a woman who had her first recurrence 17 years after initial therapy, presenting with metastatic disease to the lungs and cerebellum. This case represents the longest reported interval between primary therapy and recurrence and supports the conclusion made by others that women who have been treated for clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the cervix and vagina may remain at risk of disease progression for many years after initial therapy. Therefore, these women should continue to be monitored. We also recommend periodic chest x-rays for two reasons: 1) The lungs are the most common site of distant spread of disease; and 2) metastatic nodules may be amenable to curative surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Because of disappointing results using homologous collagen for scleral reinforcement in the treatment of pathologic myopia in humans, we undertook a series of experiments in rabbits to test the mechanical properties and long-term biocompatibility of three different synthetic graft materials. Grafts made from two of these materials, Gore-Tex Soft Tissue Patch (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) and Miragel (poly[methyl acrylate-co-hydroxy-ethyl acrylate]), were easy to position about the globe. Both materials, however, were resistant to invasion by fibrovascular tissue. The third material, woven Dacron (polyethylene terephthalate), though more difficult to position, permitted extensive invasion of fibrovascular tissue, which made all parts of the graft firmly adherent to the globe. Our results indicate the long-term compatibility of all three of these materials when used as periscleral grafts in rabbits. However, our results also suggest that a woven material such as commercially available Dacron is a more suitable graft material for scleral reinforcement in humans than collagen, Miragel, or Gore-Tex.\r"

Of the 381 injections, 308 had been given to patients who returned for follow-up examinations. No systemic effects were noted at any of these visits; all side effects were temporary; there were no serious complications. Ptosis, the most frequently encountered problem, occurred after 26 (8.4%) of the injections. Other complications included: corneal exposure (after eight injections, 2.59%); face droop (after 11 injections, 3.57%); diplopia (after five injections, 1.62%); and subtle visual blurring (after eight injections, 2.59%). One patient noted jaw tenseness, another mentioned tearing, one reported brow droop, and another complained of crossed eyes. Ten injections had minimal effect; in these cases a repeat injection usually was effective. Only four patients chose surgery after beginning injections. We conclude that botulinum toxin injections are a safe, effective means of treating lid spasms.\r"

Also, the mean postoperative fall in IOP was greater in the \"filtered\" eyes than it was in the combined group (9.8 +/- 4.6 mm Hg and 12.1 +/- 5.2 mm Hg, respectively, at 18 months). Finally, the number of medications required to maintain controlled IOP in the combined group was greater (and resumed preoperative values at 2 years) than it was in the trabeculectomy group (62.5% of the filtered eyes remained controlled unaided).\r"

Ten eyes (40%) developed moderate to severe pain transiently, and 10 (40%) developed substantial, but transient, inflammation.

Initially, the Nd:YAG laser was directed via a goniolens at the interface of the trabeculectomy flap and scleral bed. This attempt to restore filtration was unsuccessful. In two separate treatment sessions the Nd:YAG laser was directed transconjunctivally onto the visible trabeculectomy flap margins, followed by focusing the laser onto the gray-white episcleral fibrous tissue overlying the scleral flap. During the last transconjunctival treatment, the bleb elevated immediately and the IOP decreased from 30 mm Hg to 18 mm Hg. These effects have been sustained over 3 months of follow-up.\r"

The first group received both cryo treatment and heparin; a second group received heparin without cryo treatment; a third group received neither heparin nor cryo treatment. Complete opacification of the lens developed 3 months after the operation in all the rabbits not treated with heparin, and in 50% of those that received heparin. The addition of cryo treatment to the heparin-treated rabbits further reduced opacification by 20%. We conclude that in rabbits, cryo treatment, combined with intracameral administration of heparin during surgery, has a significant inhibitory effect on secondary cataract formation.\r"

All 20 patients underwent carotid artery noninvasive testing and 4 (20%) were found to have hemodynamically significant carotid artery disease.

However, widths of retinal arteries and veins were reduced in nine subjects tested after 15 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours of 10 degrees head-down tilt; and values varied inversely with intraocular pressures (IOP).

Seven patients (63%) required cytotoxic drugs, alone or in combination with low-dose oral corticosteroids. Only one patient was treated successfully with systemic corticosteroids alone. Two patients were controlled with dapsone and one with an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Dapsone, which has been reported to be effective in the treatment of relapsing polychondritis, did not control the destructive scleral inflammation in six (75%) of eight patients; two (50%) of four patients with diffuse anterior scleritis were controlled with this drug. Patients with nodular and necrotizing scleritis were controlled with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, respectively. These data suggest that the ocular manifestations of relapsing polychondritis, especially nodular and necrotizing scleritis, are less amenable to treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or dapsone and that more potent immunosuppressants (azathioprine and cyclophosphamide) may be required to treat these lesions successfully. Results of histologic and immunofluorescent examination of conjunctival and/or scleral biopsy specimens from three patients confirmed the vasculitic nature of the eye lesions in this disease.\r"

In aphakic eyes that have undergone previous vitreous surgery, flat anterior chambers will not develop, but large choroidal detachments and delayed suprachoroidal hemorrhage may occur while the eye is soft. To maintain intraocular pressure (IOP) in the early postoperative period, the authors used a technique to seal the drainage tube with a Vicryl tie, combined with injection of sodium hyaluronate, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), or perfluoropropane (C3F8), perioperatively in 28 eyes undergoing glaucoma tube implant surgery. Eight eyes were treated with injection of sodium hyaluronate, 8 with SF6, and 12 eyes with C3F8. Hypotony was significantly less frequent in eyes treated with C3F8 compared with sodium hyaluronate (P less than 0.05). Mean IOP was significantly higher for eyes treated with C3F8 injection compared with sodium hyaluronate for the first 4 days after surgery (P less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "Persistent diurnal fluctuations in vision are common after radial keratotomy (RK), associated with a myopic change in refraction and keratometric power as the day progresses. A possible relation between keratometric power and either intraocular pressure (IOP) or corneal hydration was investigated in a cadaver eye model. First, keratometric power was measured before and after RK while IOP was varied from less than 0.5 to 20 mmHg. A nonlinear relation was found; in particular, changes in IOP in the physiologic range had no effect on keratometric power after RK. In a second set of experiments, keratometric power was measured after RK as the dehydrated corneas were gradually hydrated with balanced salt solution. After RK, keratometric power decreased markedly as corneal hydration increased (0.33 diopters [D] per 10-microns increase in thickness). The keratometric power of control corneas was not affected by changes in IOP or hydration. The author concludes that diurnal fluctuations in refraction after RK are probably caused by diurnal fluctuations in corneal hydration rather than changes in IOP.\r"

Results of bacterial, viral, fungal, and chlamydial cultures were negative. Results of histopathologic examination of a corneal biopsy specimen and, later, a penetrating keratoplasty specimen showed many extracellular and intracellular spores in degenerating keratocytes. By electron microscopy there were encapsulated oval structures measuring approximately 3.5 to 4 microns in length x 1.5 microns in width. Mature spores had well-developed cell walls that contained two abutted nuclei (diplokaryon) and a redundant polar tubule with six coils. These structures are characteristic of a protozoa in the genus Nosema.\r"

The major deterrent to success frequently lies within the organization itself. As the organization continually focuses on areas that need improvement, it is unable simultaneously to focus on and positively position its strengths. Within the organization, such a phenomenon often leads to staff dissatisfaction, organizational dysfunction, and failure to meet goals and objectives. Through the strategic use of positioning, old images can be strengthened or changed, new images can be created, and the organization's many \"publics\" can be positively and significantly influenced. Successful organizations are those that have mastered the art of positioning and view it as an essential part of their everyday life.\r"

Several new initiatives and incentives have been implemented to maintain nurse satisfaction during this period of nurse shortage, but the primary nurse's relationship with her or his patient is the most satisfying and rewarding opportunity in this setting. The professional profile of the nurse staff reflects high academic preparation, certification in clinical area of practice, and involvement in nursing organizations. Primary nursing is successful because of the availability of support services, which enable the nurse to remain with the patient on the nursing unit. The primary nursing care delivery model and staffing were evaluated and revised to include licensed vocational (practical) nurses as associate nurses. Nurses on staff affirm their authority and autonomy to make and carry out clinical decisions about the nursing care of their primary patients. Physicians recognize nurses as the co-primary care provider in a clinical practice atmosphere of mutual respect and collaboration. New opportunities for professional growth and self-actualization enrich the work environment.\r"

Nursing education has a unique responsibility to provide socialization experiences that promote collegiality and self-confidence. Educational opportunities need to be planned to attract potential students who are currently underrepresented in nursing. The future of nursing is unlimited in its potential for nurses themselves and the people for whom we care, provided the professional maturity that supports full collegial partnership in the delivery of health care is achieved.\r"

A growing body of facts and perceptions has led to some specific recommendations for action. The potential for elaborating and explicating a base of scientific knowledge is powerful. The view expressed in this article is that a body of knowledge that can guide action to remedy the shortage problem requires directing knowledge development to serve the purposes of nursing and its constituents, clarifying and creating conceptual and theoretic perspectives, and giving attention to critical methodologic analysis of the current and emerging research programs in this domain. Knowledge directions will be guided by the goals and aims of nursing. Conceptual and theoretic perspectives derived from the phenomena of concern and congruent with knowledge development directions will provide a base for organizing and interpreting the growing body of facts. Finally, the understanding of research as modes of engagement will supply a means to analyze critically the methodologic approaches and the consequences of knowledge development in the domain of the nursing shortage inquiry.\r"

The current cycle of the shortage of nurses is also complicated by deep differences of opinion among nurses, physicians, and hospitals regarding the origin of, and therefore the solution to, the problem. Despite this, I predict that by the characteristic American version of \"muddling through\" in health policy, the nursing shortage will be \"solved,\" or at least resolved, by 1993.\r"

The left vertebral artery was seen to be the predominant collateral already on postoperative day 1.

The 30-day mortality/5-year survival (%/% +/- SE) was 18/67 +/- 7, after aortic valve replacement (n = 50), 6/82 +/- 10 in the mitral group (n = 18) and 38/63 +/- 17 after double valve replacement (n = 8): NS/NS. In patients with destruction and/or abscess of the anulus (DESAB), which was commonest in the aortic group, the corresponding figures were 31/48 +/- 10, compared with 10/81 +/- 6 in the other patients (p less than 0.05/less than 0.01). Atrioventricular block and complete bundle branch block were commoner in the former group. When the time from onset of fever to operation was 1-6 months (n = 50), the 5-year survival was 79 +/- 6% compared with 51 +/- 10% (p less than 0.05) when that time was less than 1 month (n = 14) or greater than 6 months (n = 12). Logistic regression analysis showed NYHA class III-IV and DESAB to be independent risk factors in 30-day mortality, which was 3.8% when neither, and 46.2% when both of these factors were present (p less than 0.01). Cox regression analysis identified NYHA class IV (p less than 0.0001), calcified mitral valve or anulus (p = 0.001), DESAB (p = 0.01), male gender (p = 0.02), supraventricular arrhythmia (p = 0.04) and vegetations on the diseased valve (p = 0.05) as independent determinants of overall long-term mortality. Patients with none (n = 6), any one (n = 16), any two (n = 28), any three (n = 20), any four (n = 6) or any five (n = 2) of these risk factors (none had 6) had respective 30-day/5-year survival rates (% +/- SE) of 100/100, 94 +/- 6/94 +/- 6, 89 +/- 6/85 +/- 7, 75 +/- 10/43 +/- 13, 67 +/- 9/17 +/- 15 (at 1 year) and 0/0 (p less than 0.0001). Identification of independent risk factors permitted stratification of the patients into subgroups with prognosis ranging from 100% 5-year survival to 0% 30-day survival. Surgical treatment of native infective endocarditis should be undertaken before cardiac disability is advanced or infective destruction of the anulus, notably of the aortic valve, becomes evident.\r"

  ".W": "St. Jude Medical bileaflet valve replacement was performed on 182 patients--aortic in 90, mitral in 70, both sites in 20 and tricuspid in two. The 30-day mortality was 4.3%, and was related to poor preoperative condition (NYHA class III or IV). The late mortality during observation up to 8 years was 9.3%, with actuarial survival 87.4% at 5 years and 86.3% at 8 years. For aortic, mitral and double valve replacement the respective 8-year figures were 88, 87.3 and 76.2%. Late death was associated with high preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance in five cases, dysrhythmia in four, myocardial infarction in two, thromboembolism, paravalvular leakage, prosthetic endocarditis or bleeding, each in one case, and was accidental in two cases. Calculated per 100 patient years the incidence of late thromboembolic events was 1.0, of bleeding complications 0.9 and of prosthetic valve endocarditis and paravalvular leak 0.26 (8, 7, 2 and 2 cases). The NYHA class in the 144 cases available for follow-up was I in 63%, II in 27% and III in 10%. The St. Jude Medical prosthesis thus was reliable, with good long-term performance.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-seven cases of classical bronchial carcinoid were followed up for at least 10 years after curative resection. Surgery was conservative in 15 cases. True lymph-node metastases were identified at operation in two cases. Distant metastases were confirmed in two patients after 5 and 10 years, respectively. One died of unrelated cause 10 years, and the other is alive 19 years, postoperatively. Radiotherapy relieved bone pain in both cases, and chemotherapy halted disease progression in one of them. In immunostaining the original histologic material, all carcinoids expressed neuron-specific enolase, and most expressed chromogranin A, synaptophysin and serotonin. Demonstration of ACTH and related opiopeptides did not portend a more aggressive course or identify cases with nodal metastases. Despite their low malignant potential, long-term follow-up of bronchial carcinoids is warranted. Even in the rare cases of distant metastases, long-term survival seems to be the rule. The occasional presence of nodal metastases and/or demonstration of ACTH and other opiopeptides, while more frequent in neuroendocrine carcinomas, are not inconsistent with bronchial carcinoids and seemingly do not alter their overall favorable prognosis.\r"

The hepatic cysts were removed via the thoracotomy performed for removal of the lung cyst in seven patients and via thoracolaparotomy in two. The postoperative course was satisfactory and no recurrence of cyst has been observed, although mebendazole was not given.

The hearts were randomized in two groups and subjected to different techniques of reperfusion. The group I hearts were exposed to rapidly rising perfusion pressure and temperature, and in group II slowly rising pressure and temperature were employed. After 60 min of reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure, coronary flow and tissue content of high-energy phosphates were evaluated. Left ventricular pressure and coronary flow were significantly better preserved in group II. Recovery of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate was significantly lower in group I (5.27 +/- 0.38 and 8.72 +/- 0.62 mumol x g dry weight-1) than in group II (9.31 +/- 0.41 and 14.97 +/- 0.62). The study thus demonstrated that functional recovery, restoration of coronary flow and normalization of high-energy phosphate stores after long periods of hypothermic cardioplegic ischemia can be considerably influenced by the employed reperfusion technique.\r"

Three hypotheses have been proposed to account for such fluctuations. (i) Irregular dynamics result from random shocks to systems with stable equilibria. (ii) The intrinsic dynamics correspond to biennial cycles that are subject to stochastic forcing. (iii) Aperiodic fluctuations are intrinsic to the epidemiology. Comparison of real world data and epidemiological models suggests that measles epidemics are inherently chaotic. Conversely, the extent to which chickenpox outbreaks approximate a yearly cycle depends inversely on the population size.\r"

In addition to the Hin protein and the two recombination sites that flank the invertible segment, a third cis-acting recombinational enhancer sequence and the Fis protein, which binds to two sites within the enhancer, are required for efficient recombination. Intermediates of this reaction were trapped during DNA strand cleavage and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy in order to determine their structure and composition. The analyses demonstrate that the recombination sites are assembled at the enhancer into a complex nucleo-protein structure (termed the invertasome) with the looping of the three segments of intervening DNA. Antibody studies indicated that Fis physically interacts with Hin and that both proteins are intimately associated with the invertasome. In order to achieve this protein-protein interaction and assemble the invertasome, the substrate DNA must be supercoiled.\r"

Heme groups are in direct communication across a novel subunit interface formed by the E and F helices. The conformational changes at this interface that accompany ligand binding are more dramatic at a tertiary level but more subtle at a quaternary level than those in mammalian hemoglobins. These findings suggest a cooperative mechanism that links ligation at one subunit with potentiation of affinity at the second subunit.\r"

The structure was determined by distance geometry and refined by nuclear Overhauser and exchange spectroscopy back calculation. The peptide is built on a foundation of three antiparallel beta strands to which other parts of the sequence are attached by three disulfide bridges. The overall shape is roughly ellipsoidal, with axes of approximately 2.5 and 1.5 nanometers. Nine of the ten charged groups are located on one side of the ellipsoid, with seven of the eight positive residues lying in a stripe 2.5 nanometers in length. The other side displays three hydrophobic residues projecting prominently into aqueous solution.

By interdigitation of the leucines of four such helices, the design called for self-association into a four-alpha-helical bundle. The crystal structure (2.7 angstrom resolution; R factor = 0.215) reveals a structure more complex than the design, with both a tetramer and a hexamer. The alpha-helical tetramer with leucine interior has more oblique crossing angles than most four-alpha-helical bundles; the hexamer has a globular hydrophobic core of 12 leucine residues and three associated sulfate ions. Computational analysis suggests that the hexameric association is tighter than the tetrameric one. The consistency of the structure with the design is discussed, as well as the divergence.\r"

In addition, the induced tissues are organized into a rudimentary embryonic axis. These results suggest that PIF or a closely related molecule is involved in inducing anterior structures and organizing the frog body plan.\r"
