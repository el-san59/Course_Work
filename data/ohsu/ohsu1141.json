  ".W": "To find out whether non-steroidial anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the proliferation of mucosal cells that normally leads to healing of gastric ulcers a microdissection technique was used to quantify mitosis in gastric glands at the ulcer edge in relation to that in the adjacent mucosa. The regeneration index thus obtained of the ulcer edge was greater in the 9 subjects with gastric ulcers not taking NSAIDs (mean index 3.1 [SEM 0.61]) than that in the 8 patients taking NSAIDs (index 1.49 [0.16]). In rats in which gastric ulcers were produced with a cryoprobe, the ulcers were larger and slower to heal in those receiving indomethacin than in controls; also, immunohistochemical staining indicated significantly fewer mitotic cells in glands adjacent to the ulcer in indomethacin-treated rats (8 mitoses [SEM 3]) than in control animals (25 [5]). The prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol reversed the inhibition of healing and substantially restored the proliferative rate in the animals. Inhibition of epithelial cell division normally involved in gastric ulcer healing would contribute to the high prevalence of gastric ulcer during NSAID therapy.\r"

Somatostatin inhibits insulin and LH secretion in healthy adults, so the effect of treatment with a long-acting somatostatin analogue ('Sandostatin') on gonadotropin and androgen secretion in PCOS was investigated. LH pulsatility, androgen concentrations, and hormonal responses to an oral glucose load and to administration of a GnRH agonist (buserelin) were measured before and after 7 days' treatment with sandostatin 100 micrograms subcutaneously twice a day in 10 amenorrhoeic women with classic features of PCOS. Sandostatin significantly reduced integrated LH concentrations and LH pulse amplitudes, oestradiol, testosterone, and androstenedione concentrations, and LH responses to buserelin; it also suppressed insulin and C-peptide responses to an oral glucose load. Thus sandostatin inhibits pituitary and ovarian hormonal responses in part by a direct influence on pituitary activity, and the possibility of an indirect effect mediated by changes in insulin concentrations requires investigation. These findings have implications for the treatment of infertility in women with PCOS.\r"

The organism was also found in the upper genital tract of 9 of the 12 women without laparoscopic evidence of PID. Most of the women with abdominal pain or tenderness had tubal or endometrial C trachomatis infection, although only half had laparoscopic evidence of salpingitis. This finding suggests that antibiotic treatment should be given as soon as chlamydial infection is detected in the cervix and that pain does not necessarily point to C trachomatis in the upper genital tract. Laparoscopy may miss important pathogens in the upper genital tract, unless the procedure is complemented with detailed microbiological investigation.\r"

The increased incidence of tuberculosis observed among silicate workers could be explained by accumulation of iron complexed by dust particles in the lung and made available to dormant mycobacteria as a virulence factor.\r"

Three temporal patterns of viraemia were observed: transient viraemia in acute resolving NANBH; viraemia lasting for several years in chronic NANBH; and intermittent viraemia in chronic NANBH, with an initial transient phase followed by recurrence after many months. In three of five cases the initial detection of serum HCV RNA was made before the onset of liver function test abnormality, many weeks or months before anti-C100 seroconversion. Diagnosis of acute HCV infection may therefore be possible much earlier by PCR than by existing serological techniques, but the timing of samples may be critical.\r"

Unilateral involuntary postural tremor in essential tremor patients was associated with blood flow significantly greater than that at rest in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, both lateral premotor regions, and both cerebellar hemispheres. Of these regions, only the cerebellum was not activated in normal controls holding a posture without tremor or in essential tremor patients undergoing passive wrist movement. The increased flow in the cerebellum therefore seems to represent neural activity involved in tremor generation. It is proposed that essential tremor is due to oscillation within cerebello-olivary pathways, relayed by way of the thalamus and motor cortex to the spinal cord.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Zidovudine delays the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but is associated with hematologic toxicity at high doses. Regimens are needed that preserve or enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity. Acyclovir has been reported to potentiate the effect of zidovudine on HIV in vitro. METHODS. We conducted a Phase II open-label, dose-escalating trial to evaluate the clinical and antiviral effects of zidovudine at low (300 mg daily, 28 subjects), medium (600 mg, 24 subjects), and high (1500 mg, 15 subjects) doses, either with or without acyclovir (4.8 g) by random assignment. The subjects had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, but not AIDS. All of them had either HIV p24 antigenemia or plasma viremia and CD4-lymphocyte counts of 200 to 500 per cubic millimeter when they began treatment. RESULTS. Performance scores and fatigue improved the most in the low- and medium-dose zidovudine groups (both P less than or equal to 0.025). Those assigned to low-dose zidovudine gained the most weight and had the greatest improvement in the mean CD4-lymphocyte count (from 321 per cubic millimeter at base line to 412 per cubic millimeter after 12 weeks, P = 0.01). The proportion of subjects in whom HIV antigenemia resolved, the decrease in the level of antigenemia, and the reduction in the plasma virus titers were similar at all three doses. Subjects assigned to receive the low or medium dose who subsequently crossed over to the 1500-mg dose (n = 19) did not have an increase in CD4-cell counts or a decline in levels of HIV antigen, but they did have dose-related toxicity. The addition of acyclovir to zidovudine was well tolerated, but it did not enhance any of zidovudine's antiretroviral effects. CONCLUSIONS. In this pilot study a very low dose of zidovudine (300 mg) had clinical and virologic effects similar to those of higher daily doses (600 and 1500 mg). The minimal effective dose of zidovudine for the treatment of HIV infection has yet to be determined, and further studies of very low daily doses are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is now known to be the chief cause of transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis, but the prevalence of HCV among blood donors and the frequency of transmission by blood transfusion are unknown. METHODS. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of a test for antibody to HCV, we tested serum samples from participants in a large study of transfusion-associated hepatitis. Samples were obtained prospectively from consecutive adults undergoing open-heart surgery in Spain, but were tested retrospectively, after the antibody enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV became available. RESULTS. Of 280 transfusion recipients given a total of 1109 units of blood, 27 (9.6 percent) had transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis (mean follow-up, 52 weeks) and 24 of the 27 seroconverted to anti-HCV-positive, whereas only 2 (0.8 percent) of the remaining transfusion recipients seroconverted. Among the 1044 donor specimens available for testing, 16 (1.5 percent) had anti-HCV antibody. Only 1 additional seropositive donor was found when 44 implicated donors who had been seronegative were retested 9 to 12 months later. Of the 16 recipients of anti-HCV-positive blood, 14 (88 percent) had transfusion-associated hepatitis and seroconverted to anti-HCV-positive. The remaining two recipients had neither hepatitis nor anti-HCV antibody. Among 25 patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis for whom all transfused blood was tested, 14 had received blood positive for anti-HCV. CONCLUSIONS. About 90 percent of blood donors with antibody to HCV have infectious virus in their blood. The screening of blood donors for anti-HCV antibody should prevent about half the cases of transfusion-associated hepatitis, but the donors with infectious virus who are anti-HCV-negative may remain seronegative for prolonged periods.\r"

To estimate how many HIV-infected seronegative donors would be identified if p24-antigen screening was introduced, we tested selected donations from a repository of 200,000 serum samples from voluntary donors that was established in late 1984 and early 1985. The 8597 serum samples selected for p24-antigen screening were chosen because their donors had demographic characteristics known to be associated with a high prevalence of seropositivity. RESULTS. The prevalence of anti-HIV-1 antibodies in the 1984-1985 serum samples selected for p24-antigen screening was 1.54 percent--more than 100 times the 0.012 percent prevalence in present-day donations in the United States. The antigen was detected in 15 of 132 serum samples (11.4 percent) from donors who had already been confirmed as seropositive. No instance of confirmed positivity for p24 antigen was found among the 8465 seronegative serum samples. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that the yield of screening for p24 antigen in volunteer donors to identify HIV-1 carriers would be negligible. We therefore recommend against routine screening with currently available p24-antigen assays.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We performed a multicenter study in 1989 to determine whether screening whole-blood donors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen would improve transfusion safety by identifying carriers of the virus who are seronegative for HIV-1 antibody. METHODS. More than 500,000 donations were tested at 13 U.S. blood centers with test kits from two manufacturers. Units found repeatedly reactive were retested in a central laboratory; if the results were positive, they were confirmed by a neutralization assay. A subgroup of units was also tested for HIV-1 by the polymerase chain reaction. Selected donors confirmed or not confirmed as having p24 antigen were contacted for follow-up interviews to identify risk factors and undergo retesting for HIV-1 markers. RESULTS. Positive tests for p24 antigen were confirmed by neutralization in five donors (0.001 percent of all donations tested), all of whom were also positive for HIV-1 antibody and HIV-1 by polymerase chain reaction. Three of the antigen-positive donors had other markers of infectious disease that would have resulted in the exclusion of their blood; two had risk factors for HIV-1 that should have led to self-exclusion. Of 220 blood units with repeatedly reactive p24 antigen whose presence could not be confirmed by neutralization (0.04 percent of the donations studied), none were positive for HIV-1 antibody, HIV-1 by polymerase chain reaction (120 units tested), or virus culture (76 units tested)--attesting to the specificity of confirmatory neutralization. CONCLUSIONS. The finding that no donation studied was positive for p24 antigen and negative for HIV-1 antibody suggests that screening donors for p24 antigen with tests of the current level of sensitivity would not add substantially to the safety of the U.S. blood supply.\r"

In neurons, a large portion of cellular energy is expended by this enzyme to maintain the ionic gradients that underlie resting and action potentials. Although neurotransmitter regulation of the enzyme in brain has been reported, such regulation has been characterized either as a nonspecific phenomenon or as an indirect effect of neurotransmitter-induced changes in ionic gradients. We report here that the neurotransmitter dopamine, through a synergistic effect on D1 and D2 receptors, inhibits the (Na(+)+K+)ATPase activity of isolated striatal neurons. Our data provide unequivocal evidence for regulation by a neurotransmitter of a neuronal ion pump. They also demonstrate that synergism between D1 and D2 receptors, which underlies many of the electrophysical and behavioural effects of dopamine in the mammalian brain, can occur on the same neuron. In addition, the results support the possibility that dopamine and other neurotransmitters can regulate neuronal excitability through the novel mechanism of pump inhibition.\r"

  ".U": "91015317\r", 
  ".W": "Cellular ras genes encode a family of membrane-associated proteins (p21ras) that bind guanine nucleotide and possess a low intrinsic GTPase activity. The p21ras proteins are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and are thought to be involved in a growth-promoting signal transduction pathway; their mode of action, however, remains unknown. The ligand-induced movement of cell-surface receptors seems to be a primary event in the transduction of several extracellular signals that control cell growth and differentiation. In B lymphocytes, surface immunoglobulin receptors crosslinked by antibody or other multivalent ligands form aggregates called patches, which then collect into a single assembly, a cap, at one pole of the cell. This process constitutes the initial signal for the activation of a B cell. Here we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that p21ras co-caps with surface immunoglobulin molecules in mouse splenic B lymphocytes. In contrast, no apparent change in the distribution of p21ras occurs during the capping of concanavalin A receptors. The redistribution of p21ras is apparent at the early stages (patching) of immunoglobulin capping and is inhibited by metabolic inhibitors and the cytoskeleton-disrupting agents colchicine and cytochalasin D. The distribution of another membrane-associated guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein, the Gi alpha subunit, is not affected by surface immunoglobulin capping. These findings demonstrate that p21ras can migrate in a directed manner along the plasma membrane and suggest that p21ras may be a component of the signalling pathway initiated by the capping of surface immunoglobulin in B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "91015337\r", 
  ".W": "There are several demonstrations that misfolded or unassembled proteins are not transported along the secretory pathway, but are retained intracellularly, generally in the endoplasmic reticulum. For instance, B lymphocytes synthesize but do not secrete IgM, and only the polymeric form of IgM is secreted by plasma cells. The C-terminal cysteine of the mu heavy chain of secreted IgM (residue 575) is involved in the intracellular retention of unpolymerized IgM subunits. Here we report that the addition of reducing agents to the culture medium, at concentrations which do not affect cell viability, terminal glycosylation, or retention of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum through the KDEL mechanism, induces secretion of IgM assembly intermediates by both B and plasma cells. Free joining (J) chains, which are not normally secreted by plasma cells unless as part of IgM or IgA, are also secreted in the presence of reducing agents. We propose a role for free thiol groups in preventing the unhindered transport of proteins through the secretory pathway. Under the scheme, assembly intermediates interact through their thiol groups between themselves and/or with unknown proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum. Such interactions may be prevented by altering the intracellular redox potential or by site-directed mutagenesis of the relevant cysteine residue(s).\r"

On transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle, the spindle pole body duplicates; the daughter pole bodies seed microtubules which interdigitate to form a short spindle that elongates to span the nucleus at metaphase. We have identified two loci which, when mutated, block spindle formation. The predicted product of one of these genes, cut7+, contains an amino-terminal domain similar to the kinesin heavy chain head domain, indicating that the cut7+ product could be a spindle motor. The cut7+ gene resembles the Aspergillus nidulans putative spindle motor gene bimC, both in terms of its organization with a homologous amino-terminal head and no obvious heptad repeats and in the morphology of the mutant phenotype. But we find no similarity between the carboxy termini of these genes, suggested that either the cut7+ gene represents a new class of kinesin genes and that fission yeast may in addition contain a bimC homologue, or that the carboxy termini of these mitotic kinesins are not evolutionarily conserved and that the cut7+ gene belongs to a subgroup of bimC-related kinesins.\r"

Protein dimerization is mediated primarily by a coiled-coil-like structure termed the leucine-zipper and DNA binding occurs primarily through regions of each protein rich in basic amino acids that contact both strands of the AP-1 site. The precise nature of the protein-DNA interaction is unknown as studies concerned with dimerization and DNA binding by Fos and Jun have relied on indirect methods to investigate protein-protein-DNA interactions. Here we have developed assay systems using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism to monitor dimerization and DNA binding directly. The results indicate that the interaction of Fos and Jun with DNA results in an altered conformation of the protein dimers and an increased alpha-helical content. These techniques may have general application in studies concerning the interaction of transcriptional regulatory proteins with specific DNA target sequences.\r"

  ".W": "Protein-DNA recognition is often mediated by a small domain containing a recognizable structural motif, such as the helix-turn-helix or the zinc-finger. These motifs are compact structures that dock against the DNA double helix. Another DNA recognition motif, found in a highly conserved family of eukaryotic transcription factors including C/EPB, Fos, Jun and CREB, consists of a coiled-coil dimerization element the leucine-zipper and an adjoining basic region which mediates DNA binding. Here we describe circular dichroism and 1H-NMR spectroscopic studies of another family member, the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4. The 58-residue DNA-binding domain of GCN4, GCN4-p, exhibits a concentration-dependent alpha-helical transition, in accord with previous studies of the dimerization properties of an isolated leucine-zipper peptide. The GCN4-p dimer is approximately 70% helical at 25 degrees C, implying that the basic region adjacent to the leucine zipper is largely unstructured in the absence of DNA. Strikingly, addition of DNA containing a GCN4 binding site (AP-1 site) increases the alpha-helix content of GNC4-p to at least 95%. Thus, the basic region acquires substantial alpha-helical structure when it binds to DNA. A similar folding transition is observed on GCN4-p binding to the related ATF/CREB site, which contains an additional central base pair. The accommodation of DNA target sites of different lengths clearly requires some flexibility in the GCN4 binding domain, despite its high alpha-helix content. Our results indicate that the GCN4 basic region is significantly unfolded at 25 degrees C and that its folded, alpha-helical conformation is stabilized by binding to DNA.\r"

Integrin receptors are involved in the attachment of adherent cells to extracellular matrices and of lymphocytes to other cells. In these situations, talin codistributes with concentrations of integrins in the cell surface membrane. Furthermore, in vitro binding studies suggest that integrins bind to talin, although with low affinity. Talin also binds with high affinity to vinculin, another cytoskeletal protein concentrated at points of cell adhesion. Finally, talin is a substrate for the Ca2(+)-activated protease, calpain II, which is also concentrated at points of cell-substratum contact. To learn more about the structure of talin and its involvement in transmembrane connections between extracellular adhesions and the cytoskeleton, we have cloned and sequenced murine talin. We describe a model for the structure of talin based on this sequence and other data. Homologies between talin and other proteins define a novel family of submembranous cytoskeleton-associated proteins all apparently involved in connections to the plasma membrane.\r"

These women were treated with IV gamma globulin (1.0 g/kg body weight) once a week. In addition, fetal blood transfusions were performed when indicated. In four patients with Rh sensitization, high-dose IV gamma globulin treatment had no apparent effect on the total number of intrauterine transfusions required, the interval between transfusions, or the volume of blood required at each transfusion. The treatment did not prevent fetal hydrops and had no effect on maternal antibody titers. In one patient with Kell sensitization, however, the course of the disease was less severe than anticipated, suggesting that IV gamma globulin treatment may have modified the severity of the disease. We conclude that high-dose IV gamma globulin does not appear to be useful in the treatment of severe Rh disease. Its role in Kell and other types of red-cell isoimmunization deserves further evaluation.\r"

All suffered for at least 1 year with recurrent menometrorrhagia that was unresponsive to other treatments such as hormonal therapy or removal of polyps or fibroids. In the first series, 75 patients presenting with menometrorrhagia were considered for endometrial ablation using Nd:YAG laser, and 23 met conservative requirements. In the second series, 12 of the 25 patients considered met the conservative requirements. The patients in series I received danazol for 30 days before and 30 days after the procedure; patients in series II received leuprolide acetate. All patients were followed for at least 1 year after treatment was discontinued. Of the 35 patients in both series, 21 (60%) were found to have complete cessation of menstruation. Eleven (31.43%) resumed menstruating but at acceptable levels. Three patients (8.57%) had unsatisfactory results, one who later had a repeat ablation and two who had hysterectomies. Thus, 32 of 35 patients were successfully treated without further intervention after laser ablation. Nd:YAG endometrial ablation is efficacious and cost-effective for recurrent menometrorrhagia in selected patients. The additional benefit of this procedure is the avoidance of hysterectomies and postsurgical complications as well as the psychological consequences of a hysterectomy.\r"

In addition, failure to respond to stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropins was consistent with concomitant ovarian failure. Perturbation of normal cellular migration during embryogenesis in the regions of the olfactory placode, yolk sac, hindgut, and gonadal ridge may explain both the hypothalamic defect and ovarian failure experienced by this woman. She demonstrates that gonadal failure need not be accompanied by elevated gonadotropin levels; nor do low gonadotropin levels necessarily indicate potentially responsive ovaries. These findings are consistent with the coexistence of isolated gonadotropin deficiency and ovarian failure in the same individual.\r"

Little relief was achieved with pseudopregnancy treatment. Satisfactory symptomatic improvement was obtained with danazol, but this medication had to be discontinued because of severe side effects. Trial of a GnRH agonist, leuprolide acetate, achieved complete remission of her chest symptoms; in addition, the patient became pregnant immediately after cessation of therapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy may be an important therapeutic alternative for women with pulmonary endometriosis who cannot tolerate danazol treatment and in whom surgical therapy fails to relieve the chest symptoms.\r"

Initially these lesions were subcategorized into four specific entities, namely fibrous epulis, fibroepithelial polyp, calcifying fibroblastic granuloma, and ossifying fibrous epulis. It was found that 46.5% of the lesions contained calcifications. The connective tissue was represented predominantly by either the collagenous type (50.5%) or the mixed (cellular and collagenous) type (44.6%). It was also found that 36% of the lesions were ulcerated, and, of these, 79.5% were associated with the cellular type of connective tissue and calcifications. In an attempt to subcategorize the fibrous lesions into specific entities, it was found that 32 cases (15.7%) had mixed features. This fact supports the suggestion that these lesions are stages in the spectrum of a single disease process and should collectively be termed fibroblastic gingival lesions. However, it is also suggested that the two terms, namely peripheral fibroma and fibrous epulis with and without ossification, should be retained whereas the usage of other terminologies should be avoided.\r"

Laced stabilizers offer an equal or possibly greater amount of support, are less costly and easier to apply, and can be retightened frequently during activity. The physician should become familiar with one of these two methods and choose one based on availability and feasibility in the community. The air stirrup may be indicated for patients with a history of ankle injury who are undergoing a graduated rehabilitation program. Nevertheless, the air stirrup has not been shown to provide significantly greater inversion restriction than taping or lace-on braces and is not recommended as a first-line method of support for individuals with no history of recent ankle sprain. High-top shoes are better when the ankle is taped, although low-top shoes are better when a laced stabilizer is worn. Elastic guards help reduce ankle edema but do not provide ankle stability.\r"

Although exacerbating substances should be avoided whenever possible, medication unfortunately is still needed by most asthmatic patients. At present, the choice of initial medication is subject to individual physician preference; beta 2-adrenergic agonists, cromolyn sodium (Intal), theophylline, and aerosol corticosteroids are all acceptable as first-line treatment. Addition of a second, third, or fourth medication again depends on individual response and physician choice. Patients with asthma need to be educated regarding the nature of the disease and its almost total unpredictability. Equally important is a frequent review of medications and a willingness to alter regimens as situations require.\r"

Factor VIII and unglycosylated tPA are inefficiently secreted and display a more stable association with GRP78. We have studied the effect of ATP depletion mediated by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) treatment on GRP78 association and secretion of factor VIII and vWF that are coexpressed in CHO cells. Low concentrations of CCCP in the medium prevented disassociation of factor VIII from GRP78 and blocked its secretion. In the same cells, higher concentrations of CCCP were required to block secretion of vWF. Thus, the block to factor VIII secretion at low CCCP concentrations did not result from a general defect in secretion. Secretion of unglycosylated tPA but not wild-type tPA from CHO cells was also blocked by low concentrations of CCCP. The increased sensitivity to CCCP concentration observed for secretion of factor VIII and unglycosylated tPA compared to wild-type tPA and vWF correlates with their degree of interaction with GRP78. In vivo, dissociation from GRP78 may be a primary ATP-dependent step in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum. ATP requirements for secretion of various proteins may vary.\r"

CA IV was localized in apical plasma membranes of the proximal convoluted tubule and the thick ascending limb of Henle. Both of these segments are involved in bicarbonate reabsorption in the rat. Immunofluorescent staining of the brush border was faint in the S1 segment, greatest in the S2 segment, and absent from the S3 segment of the proximal tubule. CA IV was also detected in the basolateral plasma membrane of proximal-tubule and thick-ascending-limb epithelial cells by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. In the proximal tubule, an extracellular membrane CA had been previously suggested on the basis of electrophysiological studies. CA IV was not detected in intercalated cells of the collecting ducts. These cells contain, in contrast, abundant cytosolic CA II. Thus, the distribution of CA IV is quite distinct from that of CA II; it corresponds with the localization of an isoenzyme(s) that did not stain with antibodies against CA II but that was revealed by histochemical-staining procedures. We conclude that the apical CA IV is the luminal CA responsible for bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb in the rat kidney. These studies also suggest that CA IV plays a role in bicarbonate transport across the basolateral plasma membrane in these two segments of the rat nephron.\r"

Hybrid RNA species with natural or mutated HIV-1 leader fused to human interferon- gamma mRNA were produced in vitro from recombinant plasmids. HIV-1 leader RNA was found to inhibit translation through two mechanisms. A 3-fold trans-inhibition of translation was demonstrated by mixing hybrid HIV-1 leader RNA with indicator interferon mRNA. By comparison, HIV-1 leader caused a 50-fold cis-inhibition in lysate in which two trans-inhibitory factors, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase and (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase, were suppressed. In contrast, purified HIV-1 Tat protein produced in Escherichia coli enhanced by 4-fold translation from HIV-1 leader-interferon mRNA but not from interferon mRNA lacking HIV sequences or from total poly(A)+ RNA. Translation of mRNA containing either a single base substitution in the loop of the \"trans-acting responsive\" sequence (TAR) or an alternative stem-loop in TAR was nevertheless stimulated by Tat. The enhancement of translation by Tat was largely due to relief of cis-inhibition, since the effect was found even in lysate in which double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase was inhibited with 2-aminopurine. These results suggest that translation is an important level of control in the replication cycle of HIV-1.\r"

We used purified brush border (20-fold) and basolateral membranes (14-fold) to characterize parathyroid hormone- and G protein-regulated adenylate cyclase and G-protein distribution. Adenylate cyclase was predominantly localized to basolateral membranes, while the 46-kDa alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs) was 2-fold higher in brush border membranes than in basolateral membranes. The alpha subunit of the inhibitory G protein (Gi; 41 kDa) was equally distributed on immunoblotting but was 2-fold higher in brush border membranes than in basolateral membranes on radiolabeling with pertussis toxin. A 42-kDa cholera toxin substrate that cross-reacted with antisera to the common alpha subunit of G proteins and to Gs on immunoblotting and that was not immunoprecipitated with two Gi antisera was the most abundant alpha subunit and comprised approximately 1% of the total membrane proteins. These observations suggest that G proteins are important regulators of proximal tubular transport independent of adenylate cyclase.\r"

We have examined the mechanism of DNA binding by individually synthesizing the putative \"zinc finger peptides\" from the rat glucocorticoid receptor. Atomic absorption studies show that the peptides will bind zinc on an equimolar basis, and circular dichroism experiments demonstrate a significant alteration in secondary structure in the presence of zinc. The results from a series of experiments establish that metal ion is required for binding to DNA and that the amino-terminal zinc finger shows a significantly greater affinity for glucocorticoid response element-containing DNA over control DNA. These observations indicate that a single synthetic \"zinc finger peptide\" is able to bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner.\r"

  ".U": "91017557\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of factors VIII and IX on the ability of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex to activate factor X was studied in a continuous-flow tubular enzyme reactor. Tissue factor immobilized in a phospholipid bilayer on the inner surface of the tube was exposed to a perfusate containing factors VIIa, VIII, IX, and X flowing at a shear rate of 57, 300, or 1130 sec-1. Factor Xa in the effluent was determined by chromogenic assay. The flux of factor Xa (moles formed per unit surface area per unit time) was strongly dependent on wall shear rate, increasing about 3-fold as wall shear rate increased from 57 to 1130 sec-1. The addition of factors VIII and IX at their respective plasma concentrations resulted in a further 2- to 3-fold increase. The direct activation of factor X by tissue factor-factor VIIa could be virtually eliminated by the lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor; however, when factors VIII and IX were present at their approximate plasma concentrations, factor Xa production rates were enhanced 15- to 20-fold. These results suggest that the tissue factor pathway, mediated through factors VIII and IX, produces significant levels of factor Xa even in the presence of an inhibitor of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex; moreover, the activation is dependent on local shear conditions. These findings are consistent both with a model of blood coagulation in which initiation of the system results from tissue factor and with the bleeding observed in hemophilia.\r"

Rotary-shadowed samples of human factor V and factor VIII were examined in the electron microscope. Single-chain factor V molecules exhibited a globular \"head\" domain 12-14 nm in diameter. In addition, up to 25% of these molecules showed a rod-like \"tail\" of up to 50 nm. Glycerol-gradient centrifugation of factor V treated with thrombin partially resolved the factor Va heterodimer from a larger activation peptide of 150 kDa, as determined by gel electrophoresis. Electron microscopy of factor Va revealed globular molecules with several smaller appendicular structures but lacking the tails seen in factor V. Images of the 150-kDa activation peptide showed rod-like structures, similar in width to the tail of intact factor V and approximately 34 nm long. Rotary shadowing was also used to visualize factor VIII that had been fractionated into heterodimers containing heavy chains of distinct sizes. Each factor VIII preparation showed a globular structure approximately 14 nm in diameter, but the associated tails were observed much more frequently with factor VIII heterodimers containing the higher-molecular-weight heavy chains. These results, in conjunction with results of studies using other biophysical techniques, suggest a model in which the A and C domains of each cofactor constitute a globular head and the connecting B domain is contained in a two-stranded tail that is released by thrombin cleavage.\r"

  ".W": "Mitochondria contain a polypeptide that is functionally equivalent to Escherichia coli chaperonin 10 (cpn10; also known as groES). This mitochondrial cpn10 has been identified in beef and rat liver and is able to replace bacterial cpn10 in the chaperonin-dependent reconstitution of chemically denatured ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. Thus, like the bacterial homologue, mitochondrial cpn10 facilitates a K(+)- and Mg.ATP-dependent discharge of unfolded (or partially folded) ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase from bacterial chaperonin 60 (cpn60; also known as groEL). Instrumental to its identification, mitochondrial cpn10 and bacterial cpn60 form a stable complex in the presence of Mg.ATP. Bacterial and mitochondrial cpn10 compete for a common saturable site on bacterial cpn60. As a result of complex formation, with either mitochondrial or bacterial cpn10, the \"uncoupled ATPase\" activity of bacterial cpn60 is virtually abolished. The most likely candidate for mitochondrial cpn10 is an approximately 45-kDa oligomer composed of approximately 9-kDa subunits. We propose that, like the protein-folding machinery of prokaryotes, mitochondrial cpn60 requires a cochaperonin for full biological function.\r"

A result of this finding is that a much wider spectrum of designed genomic alterations is now feasible. As a first application, we inserted a 5.4-kilobase cassette of nonhomologous DNA into the int-2 locus in mouse embryo-derived stem cells by gene targeting. The inserted DNA contained a lacZ gene positioned to create an in-frame fusion with the int-2 protein-coding region. Upon differentiation of these cells to embryoid bodies, the int-2-lacZ fusion faithfully reproduced the expression pattern of int-2 RNA. This ability to target reporter genes, such as lacZ, to specific mouse loci, combined with the ability to move the tagged gene into different mutant backgrounds, may provide an ideal approach for analyzing interactions among genes that participate in a developmental network.\r"

In this paper, we identify additional sequences upstream from the class II box that regulate constitutive transcription of a human class II gene, HLA-DRA, in the B-lymphoblastoid cell line Raji. Using 5' promoter deletions, substitution mutants, and nuclease S1 protection assays, we mapped a positive element, called W, between -135 and -117 base pairs and a negative element, called V, from -193 to -179 base pairs. Sequence comparisons revealed that W and V share homology with the HLA-DRA X box situated downstream. Gel-mobility-shift assays confirmed that the Raji nuclear proteins that bound to W and V elements were competed with by an HLA-DRA X-box oligonucleotide. These results suggest that X-box-binding proteins mediate both positive and negative effects on transcription by means of interaction with multiple elements (W, V, and X) within the same HLA-DRA gene.\r"

The 98-amino-acid-long VH coding region has 50-70% nucleotide sequence homology and 40-60% amino acid sequence homology with VHS of various vertebrate species. We have also found unique or species-specific amino acid residues in the VHS of rainbow trout, amphibia (Xenopus), reptile (Caiman), and shark (Heterodontus) in our sequence analyses. The RTVH431 has an unusual amino acid in the conserved 34th position in complementarity-determining region 1 of VH. Southern hybridization results suggest the presence of a large gene family related to RTVH431 in the trout genome. The complex evolution of antibody V genes is discussed.\r"

There are important differences, however, in both the substance and the quality of the information that the two systems collect. The NCHS mortality system reported an average of 9 percent more homicides nationally than did the FBI crime reporting system during the 1976-82 period. Variations did occur in the average ratios of the frequencies of homicides reported by the two systems across age, race, and sex subgroups and geographic areas. The major source of the ascertainment difference between the NCHS and the FBI systems is thought to be incomplete voluntary reporting to the FBI by participating law enforcement agencies and lack of reporting by nonparticipating agencies. The proportions of homicides among corresponding demographic categories in the two systems is remarkably similar despite the difference in ascertainment. This congruence of the distributions of reported homicides supports the idea that inferences drawn from analysis of variables in one of these systems will be valid for the population reported on by the other system.\r"

The data also show a sharp increase in cocaine mortality from 0.07 per 100,000 in 1983 to 0.38 in 1987. The data indicate that men consistently are at higher risk than women for overdose from both categories of drugs. Hispanics in the El Paso and San Antonio areas were found to have much higher risk of mortality from narcotics than expected, while blacks in the Houston and Dallas areas were at higher risk of cocaine mortality. The evidence suggests that narcotics and cocaine mortality is highest among the blue collar categories of the work force. The cyclical pattern of drug overdose mortality suggests the need for more examination of the historical interplay of public policies and social factors against the magnitude of the drug problems. The differences in mortality patterns by sex, ethnicity, and location indicate the need to develop policies and programs that address the unique characteristics of different at-risk populations.\r"

The model described in this paper ranks public health issues according to size, urgency, severity of the problem, economic loss, impact on others, effectiveness, propriety, economics, acceptability, legality of solutions, and availability of resources. As examples of how one State can use the model, rankings have been applied to the following health issues: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, coronary heart disease, injuries from motor vehicle accidents, and cigarette smoking as a risk factor. In this exercise, smoking is the issue with the highest overall priority rating. The model is sensitive to the precision of the data used to develop the rankings and works best for health issues that are not undergoing rapid change. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses can be incorporated into the model or used independently in the priority-setting process. Ideally, the model is used in a group setting with six to eight decision makers who represent the primary agency as well as external organizations. Using this method, health agencies, program directors, or community groups can identify the most critical issues or problems requiring intervention programs.\r"

The responsibility for the safety and effectiveness of these diagnostic technologies is shared by a number of Public Health Service agencies, one of which is the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), a unit within the Food and Drug Administration. The CDRH collaborated with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in conducting a study of recent trends in the uses of diagnostic ultrasound, medical X-rays, and electronic fetal monitoring devices in the medical care of pregnant women. This study used data from the 1980 National Natality and Fetal Mortality Surveys and the 1987 pretest to the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Hospitals and prenatal care providers of the pregnant women contributed information regarding the use of these medical devices. Between 1980 and 1987, ultrasound use more than doubled, increasing from 33.5 percent of pregnancies in 1980 to 78.8 percent in 1987 (P less than 0.001). More ultrasound examinations were performed earlier in gestation in 1987 than in 1980, with 10.1 percent being performed during the first trimester in 1987, compared with 6.9 percent in 1980 (P less than 0.001). Use of external electronic fetal monitoring devices during delivery also increased significantly between 1980 and 1987, from 33.5 percent to 74.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Use of medical X-rays among women with live births remained relatively unchanged, 15.0 percent in 1980 and 15.3 percent in 1987 (P = .282). The implications of these trends are discussed.\r"

This investigation examined the correlates of four health practice and knowledge indices related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) in two baseline community surveys of the Pawtucket Heart Health Program (N = 2,413; N = 2,808). An additional dimension was the use of three adult age groups (18-29, 30-49, 50-64) in conducting the analyses. Results of both surveys showed that sex was the strongest correlate of the four indices--knowledge of CVD, encouraging health practice changes in others, dietary intake, and exercise. The four indices related to CVD were also associated with years of education, primary language, and whether or not a recent cholesterol measurement had been obtained, although these relationships were not as consistent as the results for sex. Overall, about half of each survey's significant associations were also found in the other survey (survey 1, 30 of 62; survey 2, 30 of 56). Consistency of significant results between surveys was best for the group ages 30-49. In either survey, it was rare for an association between a predictor and behavioral index to appear in each of the three age groups. This study supports the importance of the subjects' sex in research on personal health practices, suggests the potential for independence even among health-related indices pertinent to a single type of illness, and emphasizes the usefulness of utilizing independent samples to identify important correlates of health behavior.\r"

Forty percent of the women had never used tampons. Significantly more whites used tampons alone (26 percent) or with pads (36 percent) than did blacks. Proportionately more blacks used tampons alone (16 percent) or with pads (27 percent) compared with Mexican Americans, 11 percent of whom used tampons alone and 21 percent of whom used tampons and pads. Since a substantial proportion of black women used tampons, racial-ethnic variations in use patterns alone cannot completely explain the low incidence of TSS among black women. Tampon use started in the early teen years, but women in the age group 20-29 had the highest frequency of use of tampons either alone (26 percent) or with pads (33 percent). These percentages suggest that age-related differences in product use may not explain the age-related differences in the incidence of TSS. Fear was the most common specific reason for not using tampons in response to information about TSS. Decreased use of tampons in response to information about TSS was reported by 39 percent of whites, 50 percent of blacks, 46 percent of Mexican Americans, and by 36 percent of women less than 19 years, 41 percent of 20-29-year-olds, and 47 percent of women 30 years and older.\r"

Of 2,000 mailed questionnaires, 1,020 were returned (51 percent response), and 997 of the returned questionnaires were used in the final analysis. Survey results indicated that most respondents were able to correctly identify the transmission routes of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but many respondents had misconceptions about nonviable routes, the incidence of HIV infection among health care workers, and some aspects of the natural history of HIV. More than half of the respondents (56.6 percent) believed that their chances of becoming infected with HIV were \"somewhat high\" or \"very high,\" although the number of documented HIV seroconversions due to occupational HIV exposures in health care settings is low. Although only six respondents (0.6 percent) reported that they had refused treatment to patients known or suspected to be infected with HIV, 25 percent felt that EMS professionals should be allowed to refuse treatment under such circumstances. Potential exposures to HIV were assessed through respondents' reports of three activities in the 6 months prior to the survey. For each activity, use of universal precautions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control was also assessed. In general, few respondents reported the consistent use of precautions. While the majority of those attempting resuscitations (86.9 percent) reported that they always use a protective device, only 36.7 percent of those treating bleeding patients reported that they always wear gloves, and only 21.9 percent of those using needles reported that they do not recap them after use.\r"

The drug users already had a considerable amount of information about AIDS and HIV transmission modes before they received the information. However, 79 percent of them reported never having used condoms. Fifty percent of intravenous drug users acknowledged having shared needles during the previous year. Subjects exhibited psychological denial in appraising the riskiness of their personal sexual and needle-sharing behaviors, which they rated as less risky than those activities in general. Following their participation in an AIDS and HIV education program, their knowledge concerning modes of transmission and disease progression increased. Subjects became more aware of their personal risk for HIV infection, and their faith in condom effectiveness and their intent to use them increased. Intravenous drug users reported increased determination to stop their drug use. The results suggest that AIDS education efforts can be useful in programs to help prevent HIV transmission among drug users.\r"

  ".W": "Seroprevalence surveys of incoming inmates provide useful sentinel information on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rates among groups that practice HIV-associated high-risk behaviors. In addition, such data are beneficial to corrections officials in the formulation of institutional policies to prevent HIV infection. Inmates entering the Michigan corrections system from December 1987 to March 1988 participated in blind, anonymous serosurveys for HIV infection. Eight of 802 entering inmates (1.0 percent) were seropositive; most seropositive persons reported intravenous drug use. The most common risk behaviors reported by study participants were intravenous drug use (20.0 percent), multiple sexual partners (37.1 percent), and infrequent (that is, never or seldom) use of condoms (82.6 percent). Women reported the highest rates of intravenous drug use (35.1 percent) and needle-sharing (19.4 percent). Results from this study indicate that in spite of wide-spread HIV-associated risk behaviors, the extent of HIV-seropositivity among incoming inmates in Michigan is relatively low. Such data suggest that there is still time to impact the course of the AIDS epidemic among high-risk groups in States where the prevalence of HIV infection is relatively low. The data also indicate that the potential for HIV spread in correctional facilities is noteworthy and that HIV prevention education and substance abuse treatment services are needed in corrections facilities.\r"

Results indicated that when using unadjusted mortality rates, for-profit facilities had much lower rates than either government-owned or nonprofit SNFs. When mortality rates were adjusted, using available measures of intervening variables, differences by type of ownership disappeared. The higher percentage of discharges to general hospitals exhibited by for-profit facilities, compared with other types of facility ownership, appears to have the strongest effect on SNF mortality rates.\r"

  ".W": "Data from surveys of the elderly are used by policy analysts to design health services programs. Consequently, the quality of survey data on elderly respondents has important implications for this growing segment of society: improving the quality of data should result in more cost effective programs for the elderly. However, studies suggest that the quality of responses from the elderly may be less than that for other respondents. Moreover, the increasing needs of policy analysts and health researchers for data have resulted in more complex survey questions that place a high cognitive burden on respondents. New methods for improving the design of these questionnaires are needed. This project investigated whether new techniques of questionnaire design, adapted from the theories and methods of cognitive psychology, could be effectively used in interviewing older respondents. The techniques used in this study, concurrent think-aloud interviews with followup probe questions, have been shown recently to be effective with younger respondents. Problems that elderly respondents have in comprehending survey questions, retrieving relevant information from memory, and using decision processes to estimate and provide answers were investigated. Questions on functional ability and social support were taken from the 1984 Supplement on Aging to the National Health Interview Survey. Analysis of respondents' think-aloud protocols and responses to probes suggest that the cognitive interview procedures were effective in identifying problems with the survey questions that would result in data of poorer quality and in suggesting the wording of questions that would be likely to result in answers of greater validity and reliability. Implications of these results for survey design and validation studies are discussed.\r"

Since telephone surveys are susceptible to lower response rates than personal interviews, several attempts have been reported to increase respondents' compliance using various precontact procedures. This investigation evaluates the comparative effectiveness of three techniques to enhance compliance with a relatively long telephone interview on epidemiologic topics. The theoretical and practical applications in the domain of telephone surveys of two techniques, the foot-in-the-door and the low ball, commonly considered nonpressure techniques, are discussed. A newly suggested, combined compliance procedure is also introduced and tested. Results show that compliance was greater for the new method when compared with each of the other two methods. Moreover, each of the three methods outperformed a control condition. The theoretical models developed to devise and explain the new techniques received empirical support in a public health survey employing 335 adult residents of Tel Aviv, Israel, in May 1988.\r"

The children were found to have a high rate of dental decay. However, there was a high rate of treatment of this decay and a rate of sealants (a preventive measure) nearly three times the rate in the general population. Although dental decay remains a serious problem in the migrant community, the migrant health centers appear to be making a positive impact on the dental health of the children.\r"

Information on smoking habits was collected in 1954 and in 1957 for nonrespondents to the first effort. Of the veterans, 84 percent returned their questionnaires. The cohort was followed for mortality until 1980, or 26 years. The followup of these military veterans, mostly of World War I, revealed 719 deaths from renal cancer, making this the largest study of renal cancer and cigarette smoking to date. Current smokers had a 47 percent increase in risk relative to nonsmokers. The relative risk for renal cancer increased significantly with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, from 1.31 for 1-9, 1.37 for 10-20, 1.60 for 21-39, and 2.06 for 40 or more. This analysis was unable to separate the risks of cigarette smoking for tumors of the renal parenchyma from those for tumors of the renal pelvis and ureter. However, the results suggest that almost one-fifth of all renal cancer deaths are attributable to cigarette smoking.\r"

TCR expression and function was not intrinsically low in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, but was found to be actively inhibited by CD4-mediated signals. Indeed, release of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes from CD4-mediated signals resulted in significant increases in both TCR expression and signaling function. These results suggest that, in CD4+CD8+ cells developing in the thymus, increased TCR expression and function requires release from CD4-mediated inhibition.\r"

The amino acid sequence valine-threonine-cysteineglycine (VTCG), contained within this common motif, was shown to be the critical sequence for the observed cell-adhesive properties.\r"

This was achieved by placing a modified h beta-AR gene under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. After induction by galactose, functional h beta-AR was expressed at a concentration several hundred times as great as that found in any human tissue. As determined from competitive ligand binding experiments, h beta-AR expressed in yeast displayed characteristic affinities, specificity, and stereoselectivity. Partial activation of the yeast pheromone response pathway by beta-adrenergic receptor agonists was achieved in cells coexpressing h beta-AR and a mammalian G protein (Gs) alpha subunit-demonstrating that these components can couple to each other and to downstream effectors when expressed in yeast. This in vivo reconstitution system provides a new approach for examining ligand binding and G protein coupling to cell surface receptors.\r"

We have studied a group of 185 patients who underwent thyroid gland operations and who were observed for a mean period of 10.25 years. Of these, 171 patients received postoperative thyroxine in a dose of 100 micrograms per day and a small group (14 patients) received no medication. In the group receiving no thyroxine, there were six recurrences, and in the group that received postoperative prophylactic thyroxine, there were nine recurrences, which is statistically significant (p = 0.003 per cent). When recurrences did occur in the thyroxine treated group they were small and easily managed by increasing the dose of thyroxine. No patient who took thyroxine postoperatively continuously underwent a second thyroidectomy. We conclude that, in this series, our policy of resecting only macroscopically pathologic thyroid tissue and prescribing prophylactic postoperative thyroxine is successful in preventing recurrent nodular goiter.\r"

This is especially true in patients with heterozygous, type II-A hyperlipoproteinemia, whose total plasma cholesterol levels above the 90th percentile for age and sex place them at markedly increased risk of death from CHD. The lipid results of partial ileal bypass (PIB) were assessed in 110 patients with heterozygous, type II-A hyperlipoproteinemia in the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias, a randomized, prospective clinical trial assessing the effects of cholesterol reduction on overall mortality and the course of CHD. Compared with dietary control (n = 52), PIB (n = 58) reduced total plasma cholesterol levels 24% +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM), reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels 34% +/- 3%, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels 5% +/- 5% 5 years after surgery. Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 28% +/- 21% higher and plasma triglyceride levels were 24% +/- 11% higher in the surgical group. The HDL cholesterol/total plasma cholesterol and HDL cholesterol/LDL cholesterol ratios were significantly higher after PIB. Apolipoprotein A-I and HDL subfraction 2 levels were significantly higher and apolipoprotein B-100 levels were significantly lower in the surgical group. PIB successfully lowered mean total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels below the limits recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program to minimize the risk of death from CHD. These results confirm the efficacy and support the role of PIB in the management of patients with marked hypercholesterolemia.\r"

Patients received 1.5 mg/kg almitrine (a peripheral chemoreceptor stimulant), 100 mg of medroxyprogesterone (a central respiratory stimulant), or matched placebo daily for 15 days in random order in a crossover trial. When subjects were awake almitrine increased the ventilatory response to hypoxia and increased arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) to a greater extent than medroxyprogesterone, whereas medroxyprogesterone augmented the ventilatory response to hypercapnia and decreased arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) to a greater extent than almitrine. Neither drug influenced sleep architecture significantly, except that medroxyprogesterone increased the number of arousals. Almitrine had a more favourable effect than placebo on oxygenation as estimated from arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) during the different stages of sleep, the number of episodes of hypoxaemia, and the amount of time that SaO2 was below 80%. The only change with medroxyprogesterone by comparison with placebo was a decrease in the number of hypoxaemic episodes. It is concluded that both active drugs improved blood gases during wakefulness, but that 1.5 mg/kg of almitrine is superior to 100 mg of medroxyprogesterone in improving SaO2 during sleep.\r"

Immunohistochemical lesions detectable by the reaction for microtubule-associated proteins 1 and 2 were visible in the subiculum-CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus and layer III/IV of the cerebral cortex after 5 minutes of ischemia (n = 4). Local blood flow was promptly reduced but still heterogeneous after 10 minutes of ischemia (n = 4); local blood flow in immunohistochemical lesions was less than 5 ml/100 g/min except in highly vulnerable regions, where flow values of 5-15 ml/100 g/min were observed. After 15 minutes of ischemia (n = 4) local blood flow in less vulnerable regions including the thalamus and caudoputamen also declined to less than 5 ml/100 g/min, and immunohistochemical lesions became visible in those regions after 30 minutes of ischemia (n = 4). On the other hand, many brain regions tolerated local blood flow of less than 5 ml/100 g/min without ischemic damage. The present study demonstrates that selective tissue vulnerability during progressive cerebral ischemia depends on the degree of hypoperfusion and on factors inherent to neurons in various brain regions.\r"

The significance of such serum reactivities remains unknown. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a new technique allowing the direct detection of HIV-1 DNA in blood samples. In this study, PCR was used to detect HIV-1 DNA in 20 individuals with isolated and persistent core antibodies (14 anti-p24 and 6 -p17), in seven sexual partners of these individuals, in 55 HIV-1-seropositive individuals (positive controls), and in 105 HIV-1-seronegative blood donors at low risk of HIV-1 infection (negative controls). No HIV-1 DNA was detected in individuals with isolated and persistent core antibodies, in their sexual partners, or in negative control individuals, although PCR was positive in 54 of 55 seropositive control individuals. These results strongly suggest that individuals with isolated and persistent core antibodies are not infected with HIV-1.\r"

  ".U": "91020339\r", 
  ".W": "Shortly after test kits for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) were licensed in May of 1990, our medical community undertook a public education program encouraging previous transfusion recipients to see their physicians about the wisdom of being tested for anti-HCV. In response, 1034 samples were received for testing. All samples repeatably reactive (RR) with anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) were tested further with a research recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). Overall, 76 of the 1034 (7.4%) recipient samples were RR and 64 of these (84.2%) were reactive with RIBA. Recipients transfused prior to surrogate testing (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and anti-hepatitis B core [anti-HBc]) in 1986 showed a 8.6 percent reactivity with RIBA and those transfused after surrogate testing showed a 4.8 percent reactivity, a 44 percent reduction. Of the 57 recipient samples reactive with RIBA and suitable for assay, 11 (19.3%) had an elevated ALT. Among 76 randomly selected blood donors with RR EIAs studied for comparison with recipients, 20 (26.3%) were reactive with RIBA, 9 of which had an abnormal surrogate test that would have disqualified them. ALT concentrations were abnormal in 6 (30%) of the donors who were reactive on RIBA. We conclude that an education program that encourages previous transfusion recipients to seek medical advice about anti-HCV testing is practical from the standpoint of the blood center. We believe more widespread implementation of similar programs should be considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The goal of cancer screening is the early detection and treatment of disease, with a consequent reduction in the mortality rate. Evaluation of whether a particular screening program can achieve this goal is a difficult task. Two components of the screening process must be assessed. The first is the ability of the screening test to detect cancer early while minimizing the number of false-positive results. In this regard, the specificity of the test ordinarily must be very high, approaching 99%. No screening test for prostate cancer has yet been reported to have a specificity this high, indicating that any prostate cancer screening program using currently available tests will have to deal with the problem of a large number of false-positive findings. To evaluate the overall impact of a screening program, the best procedure is the randomized controlled trial with cancer-specific mortality as the endpoint. This endpoint is used because it avoids the lead time and length biases inherent in other outcome variables such as stage shift and case survival. The screening randomized controlled trial must be carefully planned and implemented, because it is lengthier and more costly than the usual therapy trial because of differences in study populations, trial design relative to the planned population intervention, and the extent of knowledge of disease natural history. A further important component of screening evaluation is cost. The decision to implement or continue a screening program can be aided by using cost-effectiveness analysis, which bases a decision on the ranking of cost-to-benefit ratios for the various programs contending for limited funds. Screening cost includes the cost of the test, the cost of side effects of the test, and the costs of biopsy and treatment, while screening benefit can be measured in terms of lives saved, life years saved, or quality-adjusted life years.\r"

The adult flukes reside in the medium-sized and small intrahepatic bile ducts and, occasionally, in the extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct. The result is mechanical obstruction, inflammatory reaction, adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis. Signs and symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific, but heavy infestation results in obstructive jaundice. The disease has a close relationship with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. In this article, the radiologic findings, including cholangiography, sonography, and CT of clonorchiasis are reviewed in light of the pathophysiology of the disease. The relationship to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and to cholangiocarcinoma is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91022223\r", 
  ".W": "Detection of involvement of the neurovascular bundles (NVB) by tumor is important in deciding whether sexual function can be preserved in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostatic cancer. The nerve branches innervating the corpora cavernosa have a rather constant association with the capsular arteries and veins of the prostate, forming the periprostatic neurovascular bundle, which can be identified intraoperatively and spared during radical surgery, thus preserving potency. We examined 160 patients with biopsy-proved clinical stage A or B adenocarcinoma with transrectal sonography before radical prostatectomy to determine how useful the procedure is for predicting tumor extension into the NVB. Correlation with pathologic serial sections was obtained in each patient. The sonograms depicted the NVB on both sides in 77 patients (50%), on the right side only in 13 (8%), and on the left side only in 36 patients (23%). In 29 patients (19%) neither neurovascular bundle could be identified on the sonograms. Ninety-one tumors in this series showed evidence of extraglandular spread pathologically, which was posterolateral or into the NVB in 70 tumors involving 82 hemispheres. Using transrectal sonography, we correctly identified invasion of the NVB in 54 cases and missed it in 28 cases. NVB invasion was predicted incorrectly with transrectal sonography in 51 cases; absence of involvement of the NVB was correctly predicted in 177 hemispheres. The sensitivity of sonography for predicting invasion of the NVB was 66%, with a specificity of 78% and an accuracy of 75%. Positive predictive values and negative predictive values were 51% and 86%, respectively. We conclude that transrectal sonography currently suffers from lack of sufficient spatial resolution to detect accurately invasion of the NVB.\r"

Several approaches to diagnosis have been used, most recently CT and transrectal sonography. In this study, we investigated the value of MR imaging in the diagnosis of six cases of prostatic cyst and five cases of cysts of the seminal vesicles. All patients were symptomatic. T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images were obtained in all cases; pathologic confirmation was available in four patients. MR images were analyzed prospectively without knowledge of clinical data or the results of other imaging procedures. In all cases, low- and high-signal masses were observed on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. The cysts were unilocular with a sharply defined margin, ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 cm in diameter. The thin wall was of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Our experience suggests that MR imaging is useful in demonstrating the liquid content of prostatic and seminal-vesicle cysts and in establishing their size and location.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed MR imaging findings in 14 patients with primary soft-tissue tumors of the foot and compared them with surgical and pathologic findings to determine the value of MR imaging in anatomic localization, delineation, and characterization of such lesions. Nine tumors (64%) were benign, and five (36%) were malignant. The anatomic location (compartment, space, relation to specific tendon) and extent of all tumors were accurately shown by MR imaging. Twelve tumors (86%) were correctly characterized as benign or malignant. Eight (89%) of nine benign lesions showed distinctive MR imaging features that correctly suggested a specific diagnosis. These included hemangioma (high T2-weighted intensity and internal septa), ganglion cyst (homogeneous, high T2-weighted weighted intensity and peritendinous location), plantar fibromatosis (nodularity of plantar aponeurosis with low intensity on all sequences), and pigmented villonodular synovitis (low T2-weighted intensity and lower intensity rim). Aggressive fibromatosis (one case) could not be characterized. Four (80%) of five malignant neoplasms had MR imaging findings suggesting soft-tissue sarcoma. Two synovial sarcomas were inhomogeneous and showed extensive peritendinous growth. Two clear cell sarcomas arose at the origin of the plantar aponeurosis and infiltrated adjacent muscle. A small clear cell sarcoma could not be characterized as benign or malignant. MR imaging of the foot is accurate in showing the extent of soft-tissue tumors, which is helpful for surgical planning. Determination of their specific anatomic location may help characterize some tumors. Although our series is small, it appears that MR imaging often suggests a specific diagnosis in certain benign soft-tissue tumors of the foot and may often correctly distinguish benign from malignant tumors.\r"

After anatomic investigations in three human cadavers, we performed a clinical study in 24 healthy volunteers and 73 symptomatic patients referred for achillodynia or signs of heel thickening or both in whom a clinical diagnosis of acute total rupture was excluded. High-resolution real-time sonography was performed and the results were compared with final clinical diagnoses (55 patients) and surgical findings (18 patients). Fifty-two of the patients had been involved in various sporting activities (long-distance runners, jumpers, and basketball players), three patients had familial hypercholesterolemia, five patients had systemic inflammatory disease, and 13 patients had no known underlying cause. Anatomic investigation demonstrated accurate assessment of tendon structure and thickness. Sonograms were abnormal in 53 patients (sensitivity, 0.72; specificity, 0.83), and the extent of structural disorders of the tendon could be assessed properly. Abnormalities occurred in the form of tendon swelling (45%), abnormal tendon structure (42%), rupture (15%), and peritendinous lesions (47%). No changes were detected in low-grade disease of short duration, which suggests symptoms caused by functional disorders. Sonography is valuable in the diagnosis of various lesions of the Achilles tendon and its surrounding tissue. Furthermore, it can be used to estimate the degree of tendon abnormality and to differentiate between functional and morphologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital absence of a cervical pedicle is an unusual disorder with potentially confusing clinical and radiologic manifestations. A review of the previously reported 42 cases as well as 13 new cases is presented. Congenital absence of a cervical pedicle was an incidental finding in 10 of the 55 total patients (age range, 3-65 years; mean 31 years). The remainder presented with an array of symptoms; the most common was cervical pain (31 patients), often after trauma (19/31). Neurologic examination was normal in the majority (65%) of patients. The most common neurologic finding, in an additional 19% of patients, was isolated diminished sensation in an upper extremity. Imaging included conventional radiographs, tomograms, myelograms, and CT. The typical radiologic triad of findings included (1) the false appearance of an enlarged neural foramen owing to the absent pedicle; (2) a dysplastic, dorsally displaced ipsilateral articular pillar and lamina; and (3) a dysplastic ipsilateral transverse process. The spectrum of this disorder also included absence of the ipsilateral pillar in four of 55 patients and absence of the entire ipsilateral neural arch in five of 55 patients. Other osseous anomalies were present in 28 (51%) of 55 cases. In 10 of 55 cases, initial misdiagnosis resulted in inappropriate therapy, with a poor clinical outcome after therapy in three cases. Conservative therapy was the only successful management in all cases in which follow-up information was available, with the exception of one patient who had partial improvement after surgery. Careful analysis of radiologic images and knowledge of the specific findings of absent cervical pedicle should decrease the potential for misdiagnosis and inappropriate, potentially harmful therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91022228\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred six patients with a known or suspected diagnosis of bone cancer (11 patients with biopsy-proved primary tumors, 95 patients with metastatic disease) were evaluated with scintigraphy and MR imaging to determine the relative sensitivity of each technique in the detection of bone disease. MR imaging was performed at 0.5 T as part of the entry evaluation into Intramural Research Board protocols (30%), for evaluation of cord compression, or because of an equivocal scintigram. MR was performed with T1-weighted (e.g., 300-500/10-20 [TR/TE]), T2-weighted (e.g., 2000/80) spin-echo (SE), and a short-TI inversion recovery (STIR) pulse sequence. Scintigrams were performed with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate. A retrospective analysis showed that in 30 (28%) of 106 patients, MR imaging performed over a limited region of interest revealed a focal abnormality consistent with tumor that was not observed on scintigraphy. Only one patient had an abnormality on scintigraphy, caused by a metastasis, that was not found on MR images. In 73 (69%) of the 106 patients, the results of MR imaging and scintigraphy were equivalent; in 41 cases results of both techniques were normal. A McNemar analysis of the discordant cases showed MR imaging to be more sensitive than scintigraphy was (p less than .001). Our results suggest that although MR imaging has a greater sensitivity in detecting focal disease, scintigraphy is still the most useful screening test for evaluating the entire skeleton. MR imaging should be reserved for clarification of scintigraphic findings when suspicion is high for tumor.\r"

To evaluate the frequency and sites of femoral head impaction, we reviewed CT scans of 35 patients with hip dislocation (32 posterior and three anterior). Osteochondral impaction fractures were present in 20 (63%) of the 32 patients with posterior hip dislocation and in all three patients with anterior dislocation. In patients with posterior dislocation, the impaction occurred anteriorly in an arc between the 11-o'clock and 1-o'clock positions in all seven cases (100%) of right-sided dislocation and in eight (61%) of 13 cases of left-sided dislocation. Twelve (60%) of the 20 patients with femoral head impaction fracture underwent surgery; osteochondral impaction was substantiated in all 12. In those with anterior dislocation, osteochondral impaction occurred at the posterolateral aspect of the femoral head in an arc between the 4-o'clock and 5-o'clock positions. A high rate of osteochondral impaction after hip dislocation was detected in this series. Observing the site of femoral head impaction allows determination of the type of original dislocation. Alternatively, when the type of original dislocation is known, the site of femoral head impaction can be predicted.\r"

  ".W": "K-edge energy subtraction radiography is a method for detecting the presence of iodinated contrast material by subtracting two digital radiographs produced by X-ray beams with energies above and below the iodine K edge. We performed a feasibility study on the application of K-edge energy digital subtraction arthrography (KEDSA) to painful hip prostheses. During arthrography, loosening of the prosthesis is implied if contrast material is seen dissecting around the prosthesis, an often difficult detection task because of adjacent prosthesis metal or cement. In conventional arthrography a preliminary mask image is thus used from which films obtained after injection of iodinated contrast material are subtracted. Movement by the patient during this process may preclude subsequent subtraction. With KEDSA, since multiple image pairs may be obtained after the injection of contrast material, the problem of patient motion is virtually eliminated. A conventional X-ray tube operating between 55 and 65 kVp was alternately filtered by iodine and cerium filters to produce the KEDSA images. The apparatus was capable of producing a subtracted image within 3 sec. The technique was applied to phantoms and to six patients immediately after hip arthrography that had been positive for prosthesis loosening. Although of lower spatial resolution, the KEDSA images were, in all cases, positive for loosening in a pattern consistent with the conventional arthrographic images. KEDSA was shown to be successful in detecting extraarticular contrast material. During a single study, subtraction in various imaging planes as well as postexercise subtraction imaging can be accomplished-techniques not heretofore possible in routine subtraction arthrography.\r"

Three surgically proved lesions (one arachnoid cyst and two epidermoid tumors) and two nonsurgically proved lesions (arachnoid and ependymal cysts) were evaluated with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo studies followed by intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging. The IVIM images of the lesions were displayed as an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image obtained at 0.65 G/cm (maximum gradient b value = 100 sec/mm2) and compared with external oil and water phantoms. The ADC of arachnoid cysts was similar to stationary water whereas the ADC of epidermoid tumors was similar to brain parenchyma, indicating the solid nature and the slower diffusion rate of the epidermoid tumors. Cisternal CSF demonstrated uniformly high ADC, primarily because of bulk flow, which enhanced image contrast. Improved delineation of postsurgical changes was also possible. Our preliminary results show that diffusion-weighted MR imaging can be useful in distinguishing between arachnoid cysts and epidermoid tumors.\r"

Clinical data and MR images of 34 patients with these abnormalities were reviewed. Pathologic correlation was not available. Two types of cystic lesions were identified and separated by location: medial temporal lobe cysts arising in or near the choroidal fissure (26 patients) and parenchymal or pseudoparenchymal cysts not related to the choroidal fissure (eight patients). The choroidal fissure cysts simulated intraparenchymal cysts on axial images but their extraaxial location was well portrayed on the coronal images. Choroidal fissure cysts had a characteristic spindle shape on sagittal images. The other cysts were found in the temporal lobe (seven patients) or thalamus (one patient) and appeared parenchymal but situated close to the subarachnoid space. These lesions were round or ovoid. There was no abnormal enhancement in 10 patients studied with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Coronal images were most useful, revealing the cysts as focal CSF-intensity lesions expanding the choroidal fissure of the temporal lobe. All the cysts appeared to represent incidental findings that did not correlate with the clinical signs and/or symptoms that prompted the imaging evaluations. The MR characteristics of CSF-like cysts are important to recognize so that they are not confused with other, more serious entities, such as intraaxial cystic tumors, infarctions, or parasitic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord. Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinomas (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS. We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms.\r"

Color Doppler sonography displays the motion of flowing blood on a sonogram and is used to visualize directly arterial lumen narrowing of greater than 50%. Absence of Doppler signals signifies arterial occlusion. Preangiographic triage of patients for surgical or interventional therapy requires that a rapid and accurate survey be performed of the extent of arterial disease. Color-assisted duplex sonography was applied prospectively in 17 consecutive patients with the clinical diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease who had not previously undergone angiography. Results of angiography of the femoropopliteal arteries were graded and localized in one of seven approximately equal arterial segments. These were compared with similar segmental maps made with sonography. For the detection of stenosis or occlusion in any of the 238 segments, the sensitivity was 0.88 (49/56), specificity 0.95 (173/182), and accuracy 0.93 (222/238). The average time taken to survey both limbs was 29 min. We conclude that color-assisted duplex sonography is an accurate and rapid tool for the noninvasive mapping of the extent of femoropopliteal arterial disease.\r"

In this study, the frequency, significance, and possible reasons for this finding were evaluated by a retrospective comparison of duplex sonography and angiography. Twenty-three patients with unilateral 81-100% carotid artery stenosis who underwent both duplex sonography (16 Acuson, seven Quantum) and angiography were evaluated. In 14 patients, there was an accurate or slight underestimate (less than 20%) of stenosis present in the internal carotid artery contralateral to an artery with tight stenosis/occlusion. In nine, a velocity increase in the internal carotid artery resulted in overestimation (10-80%) of the actual degree of stenosis. In one of these nine patients, real-time images were sufficient to explain the velocity increase on the basis of vessel tortuosity. In one, falsely elevated velocity resulted from inaccurate assignment of the Doppler angle of incidence in a patient in whom real-time visualization of a distal internal carotid lesion was poor. In four of the nine patients, cross filling via the circle of Willis toward the side of greater stenosis occurred. However, seven of 14 patients in whom there was duplex sonography/angiography agreement or slight duplex sonography underestimation also had cross filling. Vertebral artery patency did not correlate well with the presence of a \"jet effect.\" These findings suggest that an increase in blood flow velocity with duplex Doppler sonography in the internal carotid artery on the side opposite an artery with a tight stenosis is a common source of error and is not readily explained by angiographic evidence of collateral flow.\r"

The commonly used blind puncture is associated with complications such as pneumothorax, arterial puncture, and hemothorax. The results and complications of 40 sonographically guided punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations of the subclavian vein (group 1, 31 patients) performed in the radiology department were compared with those of 40 blind percutaneous punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations (group 2, 29 patients) performed in the operating room. The patients were selected consecutively. The groups were comparable in age, sex, and indication for catheter placement; administration of chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies was the major indication (group 1, 84%; group 2, 83%). All punctures in group 1 were successful; group 2 had two failures (5%). Puncture-related complications occurred significantly more in group 2 (10%) than in group 1 (0%) (p less than .05). These complications were pneumothorax in three cases and hemothorax in one. Complications not related to the puncture technique were prolonged bleeding at the entrance site (groups 1 and 2, two cases each), local infection (group 1, one case), thrombosis (group 1, three cases; group 2, two), catheter sepsis (group 1, 10 cases; group 2, 14), catheter occlusion (group 2, three cases), and catheter migration (groups 1 and 2, two cases each). We conclude that sonographically guided puncture increases the success rate and significantly decreases the puncture-related complications of percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to provide a worst-case estimate of thermal effects of MR imaging by subjecting anesthetized unshorn sheep to power deposition at specific absorption rates (SARs) well above approved standards for periods of time in excess of normal clinical imaging protocols. A control period with no RF power was followed by 20-105 min of RF power application. Afterward, there was a 20-min or longer recovery period with no RF power. Eight sheep were given whole-body RF exposure (1.5- to 4-W/kg SAR) while rectal and skin temperatures were monitored. Four sheep were subjected to 4-W/kg head scans for an average of 75 min while temperatures of the cornea, vitreous humor, head skin, jugular vein, and rectum were measured. In head scanning experiments, skin and eye temperatures increased about 1.5 degrees C. Jugular vein temperature rose a maximum of 0.4 degrees C after an average exposure of 75 min. In whole-body exposures, elevation of rectal temperature was correlated with energy input. Deep-body temperature rises in excess of 2.0 degrees C were attained for 4-W/kg whole-body exposure periods greater than 82 min. Animals exposed for 40 min to 4 W/kg in either body coil (three sheep) or head coil (two sheep) were recovered and observed to be in good health for 10 weeks; no cataracts were found. MR power deposition at SAR levels well above typical clinical imaging protocols caused body temperature to increase. For exposure periods in excess of standard clinical imaging protocols the temperature increase was insufficient to cause adverse thermal effects. Studies in healthy humans are needed to determine whether enhanced heat-loss effector mechanisms are likely to cause deep-body temperatures to plateau at an acceptable level, and to elucidate mechanisms that determine subcutaneous temperature.\r"

To evaluate the potential of fatsat in examining the abdomen, we conducted a prospective study involving 30 subjects, including four normal volunteers, 18 patients investigated for liver disease, and eight patients studied for miscellaneous abdominal disease. Short TR, 300-600/15-20 (TR/TE), and long TR, 2000-2500/20-30, 70-80, spin-echo images with and without fatsat were compared. The images were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative assessment was made with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the confidence level of observers to detect the presence of disease, comparing fatsat with standard spin-echo sequences. ROC analysis showed greater interpreter confidence and accuracy for fatsat sequences than for standard spin-echo sequences. The measured signal-difference-to-noise (SD/N) ratio comparing upper abdominal organs with surrounding tissue revealed the highest values for short TR/TE regular spin echo, followed by short TR/TE fatsat. The highest SD/N ratio for hepatic masses was with long TR/TE fatsat followed by short TR/TE fatsat. The results of this study suggest that the fatsat technique may improve abdominal MR imaging.\r"

  ".W": "Spatial misregistration of signal recovered from flowing spins within vascular structures is a common phenomenon seen in MR imaging of the CNS. The condition is displayed as a bright line or dot offset from the true anatomic location of the lumen of the imaged vessel. Its origin is the time delay between application of the phase- and frequency-encoding gradients used to locate spins within the plane of section. The principal condition necessary for the production of spatial misregistration is flow oblique to the axis of the phase-encoding gradient. Flow-related enhancement (entry slice phenomenon), even-echo rephasing, and gradient-moment nulling contribute to the production of the bright signal of spatial misregistration. Familiarity with the typical appearance of flow-dependent spatial misregistration permits confirmation of a vessel's patency; identification of the direction of flow; estimation of the velocity of flow; and differentiation of this flow artifact from atheromas, dissection, intraluminal clot, and artifacts such as chemical shift.\r"

Double-contrast pharyngography is a valuable technique for detecting pharyngeal tumors. These lesions may be manifested by an intraluminal mass, mucosal irregularity, or asymmetric distensibility. Furthermore, barium studies may demonstrate lesions involving the valleculae, tongue base, lower hypopharynx, and pharyngoesophageal segment that are difficult to visualize at endoscopy. Double-contrast radiography is also a valuable technique for detecting opportunistic esophagitis and for differentiating the underlying causes. Mucosal plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas discrete ulcers should suggest herpes esophagitis, and one or more large, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis. Finally, in evaluating patients with chest pain, in only a small percentage are esophageal motility disorders found to be a possible cause of their pain. Instead, the majority are found to have cardiac disease, structural esophageal lesions, or gastroesophageal reflux, so that barium studies are more useful in documenting normal motility or structural abnormalities in these patients.\r"

In this report we review the development of this agent through preclinical studies and early clinical results at Massachusetts General Hospital during a 5-year investigation. SPIO particles are sequestered by normal phagocytic Kupffer cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) but are not retained in tumor tissue. Consequently, there is a fivefold increase in T2 relaxation between normal RES tissue and tumor, with a comparable advantage in quantitative signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and lesion detectability in the liver and spleen on MR imaging. Increased lesion conspicuity can be exploited to decrease threshold size for lesion detection to less than 3 mm. Clinically beneficial effects occur with a variety of mildly T2-weighted spin-echo pulse sequences; gradient-echo techniques show even greater benefit after administration of SPIO. Metabolically, pharmaceutical-grade preparations are biodegradable and bioavailable, being rapidly turned over into body iron stores and incorporated into erythrocyte hemoglobin. Early dose-escalation clinical trials have identified a probable clinical dose range of 10-20 mumols Fe/kg body weight. In the United States, SPIO compounds evaluated to date are still approved for use in investigational studies only. Newer commercial formulations currently being evaluated may extend clinical safety margins.\r"

Today its usefulness includes reducing motion artifacts, improved contrast per unit time, three-dimensional (3-D) imaging, real-time imaging, cine-mode imaging, and flow imaging. The focus of this review is on short-TR steady-state gradient-echo imaging. We discuss the basic sequence design of the mainstream fast techniques. Many important applications exist, including gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging of the brain and spine, subsecond imaging of real-time applications, myelographic imaging of the spine, cardiac cine-mode imaging; 3-D musculoskeletal (knee) imaging, 3-D pituitary imaging; two-dimensional and 3-D body imaging; 3-D carotid and intravascular imaging, and reformatting 3-D images into arbitrary planes.\r"

Findings on plain radiographs may be nonspecific or simulate malignancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CT in diagnosing this abnormality. We reviewed the findings in 28 patients who underwent CT to evaluate bronchial stenosis proved by bronchoscopy. Eighteen had evidence of tuberculosis on bronchial biopsy. In the other 10 the biopsy findings were nonspecific, but tuberculous lesions were elsewhere in the thorax. Twelve patients (43%) had CT findings of concentric bronchial stenosis, uniform thickening of the bronchial wall, and involvement of a long segment of the bronchi. In 14 patients (50%), CT showed obliteration of bronchial outlines by adjacent lymphadenopathy, parenchymal consolidation, and absence of intraluminal air. In two patients, the abnormality was not visible on CT. Our experience shows that CT is useful for identifying bronchial stenosis caused by tuberculosis. However, the findings vary, and in more than half of the patients concentric narrowing and uniform thickening of the bronchi are not seen.\r"

Mammographic and cytologic diagnoses, on a scale of 1 (benign) to 4 (malignant), were assigned for each case and compared with the surgical pathologic diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity were examined at different diagnostic cutoff points for regarding a mammographic or cytologic diagnosis as positive or negative. Of the 100 breast biopsy specimens, 70 were benign and 30 were malignant. For both mammography and FNAC, the optimal diagnostic cutoff point was between diagnosis 2 (mammography, probably benign; cytology, atypical) and 3 (mammography and cytology both suspicious for malignancy). At this cutoff point, FNAC had a sensitivity of 0.77 and specificity of 1.00, vs 0.73 sensitivity and 0.79 specificity for mammography. Pearson coefficient analysis revealed significant correlations between both mammographic and FNAC diagnoses and surgical pathology (p less than .001 for both). Our results suggest that use of mammography-guided FNAC may reduce the number of breast biopsies performed for benign lesions.\r"

Consequently, we compared the results of radiologic and manometric examinations of the esophagus in 170 patients (106 women, 64 men; mean age, 53 years) with chest pain. Manometry, used as the standard, was normal in 114 (67%) patients, and showed the following abnormal diagnoses in the remaining 56 (33%): nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 27 (48%), nutcracker esophagus in 16 (29%), diffuse esophageal spasm in 11 (20%), and achalasia in two (4%). Radiologic specificity was 93% (106/114) and overall sensitivity only 36% (20/56). Sensitivity increased to 50% by excluding those with nutcracker esophagus, a purely manometric diagnosis. Of the 20 patients in whom nonspecific esophageal motility disorder and diffuse esophageal spasm were undetected on radiologic examination, minimal manometric criteria for diagnosis were available in 18. Our results show that radiologic recognition of normal esophageal peristalsis is excellent. However, the vast majority of patients with chest pain do not appear to have abnormal esophageal motility on radiologic evaluation.\r"

However, this finding may be present on CT scans of some treatable tumors. During a 2-year period, we retrospectively collected 10 cases of nonpancreatic tumors that obliterated the fat surrounding the celiac axis and/or superior mesenteric artery. Four patients had metastatic disease, three had lymphoma, two had primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma, and one had a diffuse retroperitoneal endocrine tumor. The scans were analyzed for presence, location, and morphology of the mass and biliary and/or pancreatic ductal dilatation. Of the patients with metastatic disease, three had focal, retropancreatic, periceliac masses without ductal dilatation. One had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreas and causing biliary dilatation. Of the patients with lymphoma, two had focal masses in the mesenteric root without ductal dilatation, and one had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process. Of the two patients with primary carcinoma of the small bowel, one had a mesenteric mass without ductal dilatation and the other had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreatic head and obstructing the ducts. The patient with the neuroendocrine tumor had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreas without ductal dilatation. Obliteration of the fat surrounding the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery is not a specific CT finding of carcinoma of the pancreas. One cannot rely solely on its presence for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma but should use other important findings such as a focal pancreatic mass and ductal dilatation.\r"

  ".W": "Leakage from the urinary bladder or duodenal stump after pancreas transplantation with urinary bladder drainage of the graft is difficult to diagnose clinically. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with fluoroscopic cystography and CT to determine their relative merit in the diagnosis of pancreatic fluid and urine leakage as documented by surgical exploration in pancreas transplant recipients. Thirteen leaks were diagnosed by fluoroscopic cystography or by CT in 11 patients after pancreas transplantation with urinary bladder drainage of pancreatic fluid. Conventional retrograde fluoroscopic cystography showed 11 leaks; CT with retrograde bladder opacification showed three leaks. Of the five CT studies that did not show a leak and that also were done within 7 days of a cystogram with abnormal findings, failure to use retrograde bladder opacification accounted for the majority (three cases) of missed diagnoses. Focal or free peritoneal abdominal fluid was seen in all CT examinations, with extravasation of contrast material seen into both walled-off collections and free ascites. Our experience suggests that retrograde bladder and duodenal stump opacification should be a routine part of the CT evaluation performed to detect leakage from the urinary bladder or duodenal stump after pancreas transplantation.\r"

Thrombosis in and around a copper coil was recorded angiographically at regular intervals, and immediately prior to treatment conclusion. Controls (n = 10) were untreated. Group two animals (n = 10) were treated additionally with 90 minutes of HBOT at 2 atm absolute. Group three animals (n = 8) were treated additionally with 50 mg rt-PA over 90 minutes. Group four animals (n = 10) were treated additionally with simultaneous HBOT and rt-PA over 90 minutes. Myocardial injury was determined by a combination of triphenyltetrazolium chloride histochemical staining and by formazan dye extraction. Damage was measured as a percent of left ventricular cross-sectional area studied. HBOT alone restored 35.9% of oxidative enzyme activity (p greater than 0.001). Treatment with rt-PA alone restored 48.9% of enzyme activity (p greater than 0.001). The combination of HBOT and simultaneous rt-PA resulted in 96.9% restoration of oxidative enzyme activity versus the control group (p greater than 0.001).\r"

  ".W": "The effect of an abrupt reduction in atrial pressures on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion was studied in four patients with complete atrioventricular block with a dual-chamber pacemaker when the pacing mode was changed from the VVI to the DVI mode at an equal rate of 70/min. Simultaneous continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed using a balloon-tipped thermodilution catheter. With DVI pacing, there was an immediate decrease of right atrial pressure from 4.5 +/- 0.9 to 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, and a reduction of pulmonary arterial wedge pressure from 7 +/- 0.8 to 4.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, together with a rise in cardiac output from 3.1 +/- 0.2 to 3.7 +/- 0.2 L/min. However, despite a constant hemodynamic status after dual-chamber pacing, the arterial ANP level steadily decreased from 151 +/- 26 pg/ml to a steady low level of 78 +/- 15 pg/ml after 20 minutes of dual-chamber pacing (percentage reduction- 48 +/- 8%, p less than 0.05). This persisted until the end of the study at 60 minutes. The time-dependent decay in ANP secretion after an abrupt and constant change in hemodynamic status should be considered when interpreting ANP levels.\r"

Comparison of findings in the 23 patients who received t-PA intravenously 3 +/- 1 hours after onset of symptoms, with the 38 patients who did not, showed similar baseline characteristics with respect to: age, gender, history of hypertension; location of the infarct; heart weight; severity and numbers of coronary arteries narrowed; and frequencies of plaque rupture, plaque hemorrhage and coronary thrombi. Among the patients receiving t-PA, however, there was a greater frequency of platelet-rich (fibrin-poor) thrombi in the infarct-related coronary arteries (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), more nonocclusive than occlusive thrombi (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), and a lower frequency of myocardial rupture (left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum) (5 of 23 [22%] vs 18 of 38 [46%]; p = 0.045).\r"

The incidence of refractory unstable angina was examined in a consecutive series of 103 patients who received conventional medical treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and aspirin. During 48 hours of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, 24 patients had greater than or equal to 1 anginal attack, 5 of whom had both painful and painless ischemic episodes. In these 24 patients with unstable angina refractory to conventional medical treatment, the short-term efficacy of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) followed by heparin was assessed and compared with heparin alone in a randomized double-blind trial. Recurrences of ischemic attacks during a 72-hour follow-up period were documented in 9 of the 12 patients given heparin alone. All patients experienced at least 1 symptomatic ischemic episode and 1 patient had both painful and painless ischemia. No patient given rt-PA plus heparin had either symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic attacks during follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves analysis demonstrated a significantly higher probability of being ischemia free in the group of patients treated with rt-PA followed by heparin than in the group treated with heparin alone (p less than 0.01). Quantitative coronary arteriography failed to reveal any significant changes of ischemia-related lesions before and after each treatment. This study demonstrates that the combination of rt-PA and heparin has a greater protective effect than heparin alone in treating recurrent ischemic episodes in patients with refractory unstable angina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study group included 41 men and 7 women, aged 64 +/- 8 years (mean +/- standard deviation), who had presented with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (4 patients), sustained VT (32), ventricular fibrillation (8) or unexplained syncope (4). The left ventricular ejection fraction averaged 34 +/- 13%. The arrhythmias induced at the baseline, drug-free electrophysiologic study included nonsustained VT in 8 patients, sustained VT in 35 and ventricular fibrillation in 5. All patients had failed greater than or equal to 1 class IA and a combination of class IA and IB agents (mean 2.2 +/- 1.1 drugs) before encainide. Oral encainide was given in a mean daily dose of 80 +/- 11 mg for greater than or equal to 3 days before repeat programmed stimulation. Encainide was discontinued before follow-up electrophysiologic testing in 5 patients due to spontaneous development of new sustained VT. Of the 43 patients undergoing electropharmacologic testing with encainide, 5 had no inducible arrhythmia. In 9 patients VT was inducible by fewer extrastimuli, in 2 patients a previously stable VT required cardioversion, whereas in 28 patients VT remained inducible by the same number of or more extrastimuli. Thus, encainide prevented the induction of VT or ventricular fibrillation in 5 of 48 patients (10%), while it had a possible proarrhythmic effect in 15 patients (31%). Of the 5 patients without inducible VT administered long-term encainide therapy, 1 returned within 4 weeks of hospital discharge with VT recurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No ANP immunoreactivity was found in normal ventricles. Failing hearts showed ventricular positivity in 31% of the DC biopsy series, in 61% of the left ventricles, and in 30% of the right ventricles of the explanted heart series. An endoepicardial gradient was observed, because ANP positivity was greater and more extensive in the subendocardial layers. Ultrastructural studies were performed on biopsy specimens from 10 normal hearts and 132 DC biopsy samples. No ANP-storing granules were found in biopsy samples of normal ventricles, whereas ANP granules were seen in 15 of 132 (11.4%) DC cases. In parallel immunoblotting, investigation showed the same 13 kDa band protein in 1 normal atrium as well as in 8 failing atria and ventricles. ANP immunoreactivity was positively correlated with higher New York Heart Association functional classes as well as with higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.005), end-diastolic volume (p less than 0.005) and end-diastolic volume index (p less than 0.005). In conclusion, apparently healthy ventricles do not show ANP immunoreactivity, whereas failing ventricles do. ANP expression seems to be independent of the underlying disease, but positively related to the clinical status and the degree of left ventricular impairment and dilatation.\r"

Improved image quality due to the higher photon energy of Tc-99m and the increased allowable doses of this radiopharmaceutical along with its lack of redistribution makes Tc-99m sestamibi an acceptable imaging agent for such studies. This imaging agent was used for serial quantitative planar and tomographic imaging to assess the initial risk area of infarction, its change over time and the relation to infarct-related artery patency in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction. Twenty-three of 30 patients were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 4 hours after onset of acute chest pain. Seven patients were treated in the conventional manner and did not receive thrombolytic therapy. The initial area at risk varied greatly both in patients treated with rt-PA and in those who received conventional therapy. Patients with successful thrombolysis and patient infarct arteries had a significantly greater reduction of Tc-99m sestamibi defect size than patients who had persistent coronary occlusion. Serial imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi could find important application in future clinical research evaluating the efficacy of new thrombolytic agents. Direct measurements of the amount of hypoperfused myocardium before and after thrombolysis could provide rapid and unequivocal results using fewer patients and avoiding the use of \"mortality\" as an end point. This approach has not yet been widely tested in the clinical arena.\r"

Immunophenotypically, both NHLs lacked surface Ig heavy chains. With the exception of the MB2 B-cell-associated antigen, no B- and T-cell differentiation antigen was detected in case 1. NHL 2 failed to show evidence of clonality by immunohistochemical analysis but revealed the presence of many B-lymphocytes with an abnormal phenotypic profile: CD19+, CD20+, CD22+, kappa-, lambda-, CD9-, CD10-, CD21-, and CD24-. Genotypic analysis indicated that both lymphomas derived from anomalously matured pre-B-cells that had rearranged the lambda or kappa light chain genes but not the Ig heavy chain gene. The neoplastic cells of the two NHLs resemble the light chain-only B-cells recently discovered, following Epstein-Barr virus immortalization, in the human bone marrow. The authors' data confirm, therefore, the existence of the light chain-only B-cells in the human hematopoietic compartment. Moreover, their results emphasize the conclusive role of the immunogenotypic analysis in defining clonality, lineage, and maturation abnormalities of such atypical NHLs.\r"

  ".W": "The end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program is the only Medicare program for which entitlement is based on the presence of a medical diagnosis. In addition, entitlement is nearly universal. Over 90% of persons with ESRD receive Medicare benefits. Because of these unique characteristics, the ESRD program has been the subject of continuing debates about the role of the Federal government in the categorical funding of high-cost illnesses, reimbursement policies, and the ethical issues of treatment of terminal, or near terminal, patients. This report presents descriptive data from the Medicare ESRD Program Management and Medical Information System (PMMIS) concerning trends in program expenditures, incidence and prevalence of ESRD, and mortality. The purpose is to provide background material for informed discussions of these issues. Expenditures for the ESRD program have grown from $240 million in 1974 to $3.3 billion in 1987. During that same time, total Medicare expenditures increased at a comparable rate so that ESRD costs have remained a relatively constant proportion of Medicare costs for the last decade. The ESRD population is rapidly changing. Between 1978 and 1987, enrollment nearly tripled, from 44,000 to 124,000. Much of this change has occurred in the elderly population. Persons over 65 accounted for 20% of total enrollment in 1978 and 29% of total enrollment in 1987. Census projections show that the \"graying\" of the ESRD population will continue into the foreseeable future. Transplantation has had a marked effect on the ESRD population. Persons with a functioning kidney graft have increased from 11% of the total population in 1978 to 22% in 1987.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A large Australian family afflicted with Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is analyzed at the nucleotide sequence level in this report. Biochemical assays of platelet mitochondria isolated from members of this family have demonstrated a significant decrease in the specific activity of Complex I (NADH-ubiquinol oxidoreductase) of the electron transport chain. It is shown here, however, that neither this biochemical lesion nor the optic neuropathy are due to the mutation at nucleotide position 11,778 of the mitochondrial ND4 gene first identified by Wallace et al. in several LHON pedigrees. Furthermore, extensive DNA sequencing studies reveal no candidate mutations within the mitochondrial ND3 gene, the ND4L/ND4 genes, or the contiguous tRNA genes. These studies provide the first direct evidence that not all LHON lineages--even those associated with a biochemical defect in mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I--carry a mutation in the ND4 gene. Members of the Australian LHON family exhibit neurological abnormalities in addition to the well-characterized ophthalmological changes. It is hypothesized that LHON may be a syndrome or set of related diseases in which the clinical abnormalities are a function, at least in part, of the mitochondrial Complex I gene in which the proximate mutation occurs.\r"

  ".W": "Efforts were directed to identify the specific mutations in the alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) gene which cause Fabry disease in families of Japanese origin. By polymerase-chain-reaction-amplification of DNA from reverse-transcribed mRNA and genomic DNA, different point mutations were found in two unrelated Fabry hemizygotes. A hemizygote with classic disease manifestations and no detectable alpha-Gal A activity had a G-to-A transition in exon 1 (codon 44) which substituted a termination codon (TAG) for a tryptophan codon (TGG) and created an NheI restriction site. This point mutation would predict a truncated alpha-Gal A polypeptide, consistent with the observed absence of enzymatic activity and a classic Fabry phenotype. In an unrelated Japanese hemizygote who had an atypical clinical course characterized by late-onset cardiac involvement and significant residual alpha-Gal activity, a G-to-A transition in exon 6 (codon 301) resulted in the replacement of a glutamine for an arginine residue. This amino acid substitution apparently altered the properties of the enzyme such that sufficient enzymatic activity was retained to markedly alter the disease course. Identification of these mutations permitted accurate molecular heterozygote diagnosis in these families.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between anti-phospholipid antibodies and cardiac abnormalities in patients with SLE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 75 consecutive SLE patients and 60 healthy sex- and age-matched control subjects were evaluated in a case-control study. All participants underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography. Antiphospholipid antibodies levels were assayed in each patient. The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with and without echocardiographic abnormalities was compared. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, SLE patients had significantly more pericardial abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular dysfunction and verrucous valvular thickening, global valvular thickening with dysfunction, and mitral and aortic regurgitation. Among these abnormalities, antiphospholipid antibodies were significantly associated with isolated left ventricular (global or segmental) dysfunction (four of five positive; p less than 0.05), verrucous valvular (mitral or aortic) thickening (seven of nine positive; p less than 0.005), global valvular (mitral or aortic) thickening and dysfunction (five of six positive; p less than 0.02), as well as mitral regurgitation (16 of 19 positive; p less than 0.001) and aortic regurgitation (five of six positive; p less than 0.02). CONCLUSION: Valvular lesions and myocardial dysfunction are associated with elevated antiphospholipid antibodies. This study has important implications for the pathogenic role of anti-phospholipid antibodies in relation to these cardiac abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the frequency with which the diagnosis of tuberculosis is delayed in patients with concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and to identify reasons for such delays. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 52 consecutive HIV-infected patients with culture-proven tuberculosis seen at a 1,900-bed general hospital serving a predominantly indigent population in Los Angeles, where the prevalences of HIV infection and tuberculosis are high. The late-treatment (LT) group consisted of 25 patients in whom tuberculosis was untreated prior to death (n = 6) or treated more than 22 days after presentation (n = 19). The early-treatment (ET) group comprised 27 patients in whom antituberculous therapy was begun less than 16 days after presentation. RESULTS: Symptoms, physical and laboratory findings, chest roentgenographic abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis (hilar adenopathy, pleural effusion, miliary pattern, cavitation, predominant upper lobe infiltrate), and frequencies of concomitant nontuberculous disease were similar in LT and ET groups. Delayed diagnosis of tuberculosis was attributable to errors in management in 21 (84%) of 25 LT group patients. The most common error was failure to obtain at least three sputum samples for acid-fast smear and mycobacterial culture in patients with clinical and chest roentgenographic findings compatible with tuberculosis (15 cases). Acid-fast sputum smears were positive in 25 (61%) of 41 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Acid-fast smears of stool were positive in eight (42%) of 19 cases. Blood cultures yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 18 (38%) of 48 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed therapy of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients at our medical center was common and was not due to atypical manifestations of tuberculosis. In most cases, delays could have been avoided if adequate numbers of sputum samples for acid-fast smear and mycobacterial culture had been obtained, and if empiric antituberculous therapy had been given to symptomatic patients in whom chest roentgenographic findings were suggestive of mycobacterial disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Pneumonia is now the second most frequent hospital-acquired infection in acute-care facilities, and recent studies indicate that the incidence rate for nosocomial pneumonia in long-term-care facilities is of similar magnitude. The mortality rate is high, especially in the elderly. With prevention of this complication as an overall priority, this study was designed to determine the risk factors associated with nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly in both acute-care and long-term-care settings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An epidemiologic case-control study was undertaken to compare patients or residents who developed radiographically confirmed pneumonia with control subjects who did not have and did not develop respiratory infection. Thirty-three cases were identified in the acute-care setting during the 18-week period, and 27 cases were identified in the long-term-care setting. Two matched controls were chosen for each case. Data collection involved review of the medical record and verification by medical personnel while the cases or controls were still institutionalized. Risk factor variables were analyzed using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval calculation for matched triplets, and chi-square analysis. Selected risk factors were entered into a backward stepwise logistic regression to determine the best combination of risk factors for each setting. RESULTS: In the acute-care setting, current neurologic disease, current renal disease, deteriorating health, altered level of consciousness, disorientation, dependent bathing, dependent bowel function, dependent feeding, aspiration, difficulty with oropharyngeal secretions, and presence of a nasogastric tube were significant risk factors. In the long-term-care setting, deteriorating health, malnourishment, recent weight change, altered level of consciousness, disorientation, aspiration, difficulty with oropharyngeal secretions, suctioning, presence of a nasogastric or gastric tube, upper respiratory infection, inhalation therapy, increased confusion, and increased agitation were determined to be significant. Current pulmonary disease, previous infection, and antibiotic therapy were found not to be associated with the onset of nosocomial pneumonia. Through logistic regression, the best models for prediction of nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly were identified. In the acute-care setting, difficulty with oropharyngeal secretions and presence of a nasogastric tube were the best predictors. In the long-term-care setting, difficulty with oropharyngeal secretions, deteriorating health, and occurrence of an unusual event were the best combination of predictors. CONCLUSION: These data confirm prior findi\r"

Many of these women are offered human immunodeficiency virus tests in prenatal settings. One of the incentives for them to be tested is access to medications that have been shown to prolong disease-free intervals in nonpregnant human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals. However, the use of those medications during pregnancy has not been well studied and some have cautioned against their prenatal use. Thus consideration of these agents may be deferred by some clinicians until the postpartum period. In this article we argue that the availability of such agents should be disclosed to women who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus as part of the informed consent process.\r"

Leiomyomas are common, estrogen-sensitive, benign neoplasms that decrease in size by 40% to 50% during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment. During gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy most women are amenorrheic. After discontinuation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment, uterine and myoma size increase and a return to pretreatment menstrual patterns often occurs. Concerns about the safety of long-term hypoestrogenism have made long-term gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist administration an undesirable treatment strategy. This article focuses on the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists as preoperative therapy in selected women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy and the combination of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist with estrogen-progestin \"add-back\" treatment as a potential long-term medical therapy for women with symptomatic leiomyomas. Finally, an estrogen threshold hypothesis to assess the effects of circulating estrogen concentrations on different tissues, is presented.\r"

The viral ribonucleic acid probes were specific for groups of human papillomavirus types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. Laser energy was delivered by continuous-wave mode and the plume of smoke was evacuated by a vacuum suction system. Samples were taken with Dacron swabs from lesional tissues of 43 patients as well as from the treated areas and from the 5 cm surrounding normal skin before and after laser vaporization. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was identified in swabs from 34 of 43 (79%) lesional tissues and 7 of 43 (16%) treatment fields. Although a trend for higher human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid positivity in laser margins after therapy (7/43, 16%) than before (4/43, 9%) was observed, the rates were not statistically significant. It is concluded that carbon dioxide laser energy disperses human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid onto treatment fields and the adjacent normal epithelium. Viral contamination of treated areas may be reduced by positioning the fume evacuator within 1 cm of the field of laser vaporization and cleaning the treated areas and surrounding tissue after therapy.\r"

As a result there has been confusion regarding the potential benefits of routine placental examination. These benefits include clarification of the causes of many adverse pregnancy outcomes, improvement of the risk assessment for future pregnancies, and ascertainment of newborn risk for long-term neurodevelopment sequelae. Information on placental abnormalities may reveal the presence of chronic fetal insults and allow their differentiation from acute (peripartum) stresses. Current methods of risk assessment fail to identify the majority of pregnancies that end in prematurity, stillbirth, growth retardation, or fetal distress. We suggest that placental pathology should be a routine component of obstetric-neonatal care.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that arginine vasopressin mediates the fetal cardiovascular response to acute hypoxia. Chronically catheterized sheep fetuses at 126 to 138 days' gestation were infused with either an arginine vasopressin pressor antagonist (n = 8) or saline solution as control (n = 8). A 30-minute hypoxia was induced by infusion of nitrogen containing 5% carbon dioxide into the maternal trachea. Fetal arterial PO2 decreased 13.1 +/- 1.3 (SE) mm Hg from a basal value of 23.8 +/- 1.5 mm Hg and there was no significant difference in the degree of hypoxia between the two groups. Fetal arterial and venous pressures increased significantly, whereas the blood volume decreased, but these changes were similar between the control and arginine vasopressin-blocked fetuses. Heart rate fell similarly in both groups during hypoxia by an average of 35 beats/min. At the termination of hypoxia, heart rate in the blocked group rebounded to levels significantly above baseline and remained elevated for 30 minutes, whereas heart rate in the control group returned slowly to basal values. Recovery of arterial pressure, venous pressure, and blood volume were similar in the two groups. Thus it appears that arginine vasopressin may mediate in part the fetal heart rate response to acute hypoxia. However, the blood volume, arterial pressure, and venous pressure responses to hypoxia appear to be induced by factors other than arginine vasopressin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of Mg++ and the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker isradipine on contractions induced by the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 were studied in isolated human uteroplacental arteries. In all preparations investigated U46619 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L induced concentration-related contractile responses. In maternal vessels U46619 produced a biphasic concentration-response curve, whereas the compound in fetal vessels produced a sigmoid concentration-response curve parallel to that of prostaglandin F2 alpha. Mg++ (1.0 to 6.0 mmol/L) and isradipine (10(-10) to 10(-5) mol/L) both relaxed U46619-induced contractions by up to about 40%. In preparations precontracted by U46619 and exposed to isradipine 10(-6) mol/L, addition of Mg++ 6.0 mmol/L consistently produced a further small relaxation. Removal of the endothelium or pretreatment with indomethacin 10(-6) mol/L or digoxin 10(-6) mol/L did not influence the inhibition produced by Mg++ or isradipine. In vessels pretreated in Ca(++)-free medium Mg++ 6.0 mmol/L depressed and isradipine abolished responses to Ca++ (0.01 to 4.0 mmol/L) after depolarization with K+ 124 mmol/L. In maternal and fetal arteries stimulated with U46619, however, Mg++ 6.0 mmol/L and isradipine 10(-6) mol/L produced a similar, partial inhibition of responses to Ca++ (0.01 to 4.0 mmol/L). Mg++ seems to inhibit transmembrane Ca++ influx, although less efficiently than the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist isradipine. In addition, Mg++ may interfere with Ca++ at intracellular binding sites. Provided that preeclampsia comprises enhanced vascular actions of thromboxane A2, the present results support the established use of Mg++ in the treatment of this condition and suggest that calcium antagonists are of potential benefit.\r"

All pupillary membranes resolved within one hour of administration of tissue plasminogen activator, and five tractional retinal detachments resolved within 24 hours. All eyes developed evidence of intraocular bleeding after tissue plasminogen activator injection. Subsequently, six of seven eyes developed recurrence of fibrin accumulation and tractional retinal detachment.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine cytokines in human leprosy lesions by means of immunohistologic examination. Cryostat sections of skin biopsies from 57 patients with various forms of leprosy were immunostained according to the APAAP method, using monoclonal antibodies against interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and, in addition, against CD 1 antigen. Granulomas in biopsies of untreated patients with tuberculoid leprosy showed large amounts of cells positive for IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and CD 1, whereas no positive signals could be detected in untreated patients with lepromatous leprosy. However, in those biopsies obtained from lepromatous leprosy patients undergoing chemotherapy, positive staining for cytokines as well as subepidermal Langerhans cells increased to a detectable amount. Remarkably, in tuberculoid leprosy patients, the number of IL-1 beta--positive cells did not vary under therapy, while the number of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma reactive cells decreased. These results suggest that immunohistologic determination of cytokines in combination with the assessment of subepidermal Langerhans cells in human leprosy lesions may be used as a parameter for the patient's status of cell-mediated immunity under chemotherapeutic treatment.\r"

A progressive appearance of MHC-antigen-positive cells was found by light- and electron microscopic immune histology. The first level comprised cells that constitutively expressed MHC antigens in normal animals (meningeal and endoneural monocytes, some perivascular dendritic cells, and few parenchymal microglia cells, especially in the lumbar spinal cord and in the cerebellar white matter). The second level represented cells readily expressing MHC antigens after stimulation with interferon-gamma (all perivascular, dendritic cells, and microglia). The third level included ependymal cells, astrocytes, and Schwann cells. After stimulation with interferon-gamma, these neuroectodermal cells expressed MHC antigens inconsistently, usually in a low density and patchy distribution. The progressive appearance of MHC antigens may be reflected by the variances of lesional patterns found in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis of different histologic severity.\r"

The immunocytochemical characterization of cIg and sIg used antisera specific for the established kappa light chain V kappa subgroups (V kappa I, V kappa II, V kappa III, and V kappa IV) and the lambda light chain V lambda subgroups (V lambda I, V lambda II/V, V lambda IV, and V lambda VI). Studies were performed using cytospin preparations of bone marrow-, peripheral blood-, and lymph node-derived cells from patients with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis AL, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and with low-, mid-, and high-grade B-cell malignancies. The V kappa or V lambda subgroup of the cIg or sIg also could be identified after deparaffinization and enzyme treatment of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. For those patients who had monoclonal serum or urinary Igs, there was complete concordance between the VL subgroup of the secreted Ig and that of the cIg or sIg. The percentage distribution of V kappa or V lambda subgroups on the sIg of cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other cytomorphologic types of B-cell malignancies differed from that found for kappa- or lambda-type Bence Jones proteins obtained from patients with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis AL, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. In contrast to the plasma cell and lymphocytoid plasma cell diseases, a relative predominance of certain VL subgroups, ie, V kappa IV, V lambda III, and V lambda IV, and the absence of the amyloid-associated V lambda VI subgroup were found in CLL and related diseases. The immunocytochemical techniques used make possible a rapid means to demonstrate B-cell monoclonality and provide further evidence for the selective expression of certain VL genes in human B-cell neoplasia.\r"

The animals were then inoculated intraperitoneally with murine CMV and the infection was monitored virologically and histologically. High concentrations of virus were found in the lungs of mice depleted of CD4 or both CD4 and CD8 cells. These animals developed pulmonary infections that persisted for at least 49 days after inoculation. In contrast, immunologically intact mice and those administered anti-CD8 MAb experienced only a transient infection of the lungs. Focal interstitial infiltrates of mononuclear cells were demonstrated in pulmonary tissues of CD4 MAb-treated animals, but not in normal mice and those receiving the CD8 MAb. Adoptive transfer of CD4 cells to animals (rendered immune-incompetent by thymectomy and irradiation) protected against pulmonary infection and the development of interstitial pneumonia. Mice treated with CD4 MAb failed to produce specific CMV antibody, whereas the depletion of CD8 cells had no effect on antibody elaboration. Administration of anti-CD4 and CD8 MAb did not affect virus replication in the salivary glands, the preferential site for CMV infection in the mouse. Induction of pulmonary infection and interstitial pneumonia by CMV in BALB/c mice is mediated by CD4 T cells.\r"

Reactive plasma cells can be consistently identified in reactive lymphoid tissues, and a monotypic pattern of light-chain mRNA restriction was seen in each of eight cases of multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma. Immunoblasts and germinal center cells also are labeled in reactive lymphoid tissues. Using 355-labeled probes, 29 of 93 cases (30%) of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas had detectable light-chain mRNA, while 19% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were positive using biotinylated probes.\r"

We demonstrate that increases in platelet adherence and aggregation accompany Trypanosoma cruzi infection and may contribute to the observed microvascular pathology. Scanning electron microscopy and radiolabeled platelets studies revealed that platelet adherence to T. cruzi-infected human endothelial cells was significantly increased when compared to controls (P = 0.024). In in vitro experiments, we determined the influence of infection on prostacyclin production, a marker of endothelial cell perturbation. The basal levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was significantly greater in the supernatant of infected endothelial cells than in those of uninfected endothelial cells (P less than 0.05). The influence of infection was assessed on platelet aggregation at days 5 and 12 post-infection in A/J mice. Platelets from T. cruzi-infected mice were 2-6-fold more sensitive to aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and sodium arachidonate than controls. Thromboxane B2 levels in the plasma of infected mice were greater than controls. These data support the hypothesis that heightened platelet reactivity and endothelial cell dysfunction are associated with acute Chagas' disease and may cause coronary microvascular spasm and/or occlusion.\r"

A high degree of day-to-day variability of egg excretion within subjects was found both in the whole population and in the 5-19 year age group. Subjects with 1 urinary egg count of greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine were not similarly classified in 36-61% of the other 5 examinations and 4-16% of their other examinations were negative. Gross hematuria had a specificity of almost 100%, when related to a positive filtration on any day, and was closely related to egg counts of greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine. The finding of a strongly positive reaction for hematuria on a given single day was closely associated with the subject having a high egg count (greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine) on at least one of the 6 days of the study. At the primary health care level, single highly positive semiquantitative values for hematuria were a more useful diagnostic indicator than a single egg count to select patients with heavy infections for selective population chemotherapy.\r"

They used the kit during a 2 year field trial in their respective clinical hospital laboratories throughout Malaysia. In an evaluation using 1,722 consecutive sera tested in those laboratories, the kit was found to have a median sensitivity for IgG detection of 0.85 (range 0.33-0.95), a median specificity of 0.94 (range 0.88-1.00), reproducibility of 0.86, and efficiency of 0.92 when compared to the reference laboratory. In a proficiency survey in which 10 laboratories received 3 coded test samples, all but 2 laboratories had results within 1 dilution of the reference laboratory in quantitating specific IgG, whereas 7 laboratories were within 1 dilution in quantitating IgM. The shelf life of the kit was at least 1 year at 4 degrees C.\r"

Experiments were terminated on days 7 and 9 and DNA, P, and E2 were measured. Ethanol inhibited P and E2 secretion stimulated by LH; however, there was no significant effect of ethanol on P and E2 production in the control group or when the cells were stimulated by FSH or cAMP. EtOH also had no effect on androstenedione stimulated E2 production. There was no significant difference in the DNA contents of the human granulosa cells in the ethanol group as compared with the control group. These results are the first demonstration of a direct effect of ethanol on cultured granulosa-lutein cells and suggest that ethanol may inhibit action of LH on the corpus luteum.

We merged Medicare Part A (hospital) and Part B (anesthesiology) payment data for 7,770 patients for the MDDRG analysis and examined 10,431 surgical procedures for the RBRVS analysis within 27 diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) during the second half of 1986 in 16 hospitals representing different geographic regions, bed size, and teaching status. Assuming budget neutrality (i.e., constant total expenditure for anesthesiology services) and using the proposed methodologies, we simulated RBRVS and MDDRG payments and compared them to current payments for anesthesiology services. Individual surgical procedures demonstrated a two- to more than four-fold variation in duration, accompanied by a similar variation in anesthesiology payments. Within DRGs, there was a three- to ten-fold variation in duration, and a two- to seven-fold variation in anesthesiology payments. Anesthesiology time was highly correlated with surgical time (r = 0.86-0.96). Compared to the current system, RBRVS and MDDRG systems were associated with systematic variations in payments, such that on average, on each case, anesthesiologists practicing in rural and nonteaching hospitals would gain, whereas those in urban or suburban and teaching facilities would lose. After adjusting for complexity of procedure, the distribution of payment gains and losses was a function of duration of surgery, which is not influenced by the anethesiologist. Longer cases of a given surgical procedure result in payment decreases. The results document the importance of retaining a time factor in the payment methodology for anesthesiology services to maintain equitable payment across practice settings--an objective of physician payment reform.\r"

  ".W": "The sequelae of thrombus formation, both by shear forces and by collagen fiber, the subsequent coagulation, and the dislodgement of thrombi (thrombolysis) were measured from a small volume of nonanticoagulated blood sample, by a new instrument. Addition of streptokinase (SK) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to the blood sample eliminated the need for anticoagulation for thrombolysis measurement: clot lysis preceded and allowed thrombolysis to occur. The test revealed activation of platelets and coagulation by SK and rt-PA. Apart from this general trend, platelet reactivity in response to plasminogen activator showed great individual variation. Whether the greatly enhanced (42%) or prolonged hemostasis (13%), observed in different blood samples with rt-PA, could be used as a predictor of reocclusion or bleeding complications remains to be established. Thrombolysis did not occur in 12% of the samples tested. These thrombolysis models may be useful for developing new agents for the dissolution of platelet-rich thrombi. It is suggested that this technique be used for monitoring thrombolytic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Currently, Doppler ultrasound and contrast angiography are the main imaging procedures being used to evaluate arterial bypass shunts. IV radionuclide total body arteriography (TBA) is another useful imaging procedure for evaluation of bypass shunts. The authors reviewed 33 patients, 19 women and 14 men, ranging in age from forty-three to eighty-five, who had TBA done after arterial bypass surgery. Ten patients had multiple shunts and 5 had multiple follow-up studies. In total there were 80 shunts, including 43 femoropopliteal, 16 axillofemoral, 1 axillopopliteal, 13 crossover femorofemoral, and 7 aortofemoral shunts. Sixty-two of the 80 shunts were patent, 14 were occluded, and 4 had partial occlusion. The results were confirmed by Doppler studies, contrast angiograms, and/or surgical exploration without false positives or false negatives. Since the radiotracer used was 99mTc-labeled red blood cells, a MUGA study can also be performed immediately following TBA in the same injection. Twenty-eight patients had gated cardiac blood pool studies (MUGA) done; 16 had abnormal wall motion and diminished ventricular function. TBA requires only a single IV injection of radiotracer (less than 1 cc) in the upper limb. The imaging times for total body arterial and perfusion images are seventy seconds and five minutes respectively. Both total body arterial and perfusion images clearly demonstrated the entire course of shunts (single or multiple); underlying and coexisting arterial abnormalities, e g, occlusive disease (27 patients), or aneurysm (3 patients); and related perfusion changes in the extremities. TBA has unique features. It permits a complete, excellent visualization of the bypass graft without the hazard of contrast media injection. It is a simple and a virtually noninvasive procedure, particularly useful for preoperative workups and postoperative follow-ups.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, controlled laboratory investigation. SETTING: Animal laboratory. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen anesthetized, intubated sheep weighing 23 to 47 kg. INTERVENTIONS: One hundred seventy-two simultaneous measurements of thermodilution CO and ETCO2 were made during controlled arterial hemorrhage. After a 30-minute baseline control period, CO was sampled from approximately 0.6 to more than 8.0 L/min during a 60- to 90-minute period of controlled hemorrhage. MEASUREMENTS: Thermodilution CO; arterial pressure using fluid-filled plastic 14-gauge catheters; ETCO2 using an infrared analyzer. MAIN RESULTS: A plot of CO versus ETCO2 suggested that the relationship was logarithmic rather than linear. Linear regression showed that ETCO2 was significantly related (r = .91; P less than .001) to a logarithmic transformation of the CO. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between CO and ETCO2 is logarithmic. Decreased presentation of CO2 to the lungs is the major, rate-limiting determinant of the ETCO2 during low flow. As the CO increases during resuscitation from shock or cardiac arrest, respiration becomes the rate-limiting controller of the ETCO2 (after the tissue washout of CO2 has occurred). Under such conditions, the ETCO2 provides useful information about the adequacy of ventilation provided that there is little ventilation/perfusion mismatch.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoxic stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). On the other hand, almitrine, a peripheral chemoreceptor agonist, has been reported in some studies to enhance HPV. To further explore this apparent contradiction, we investigated the effects of two different low intravenous doses of almitrine on pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) versus cardiac index (Q) plots in 32 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs ventilated alternatively in hyperoxia (FIO2, 0.4) and in hypoxia (FIO2 0.1). HPV, defined as a hypoxia-induced increase in Ppa over the entire range of Q studied, from 2 to 5 L/min/m2, was elicited in 16 dogs. In the first eight of these \"responders,\" almitrine 2 micrograms/kg/min had no vascular effect, and in the other eight, almitrine 4 micrograms/kg/min inhibited HPV. In 16 other dogs, hypoxia did not affect Ppa over the entire range of Q. In these \"nonresponders,\" almitrine 2 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8) as well as 4 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8) restored HPV. To answer the question whether the ability to restore HPV would be specific to almitrine, we administered intravenously the structurally unrelated chemoreceptor agonist doxapram at the dose of 20 micrograms/kg/min to an additional group of eight \"nonresponders,\" and this treatment also restored HPV. Intravenous infusion of the malic acid solution solvent of almitrine had no effect on Ppa/Q plots in a final group of eight \"nonresponders\". We conclude that low dose almitrine and doxapram restore HPV in dogs with a naturally absent hypoxic pulmonary pressor response, probably by a direct effect at the pulmonary vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen female and 22 male patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), 8 to 29 yr of age, performed two progressive exercise tests to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer, breathing normoxic air (21% O2) for one test, and hyperoxic air (30% O2) for the other test. The order of gas administration was randomized. Minute ventilation (VE), oxygen uptake (VO2), end-tidal CO2 tension (PETCO2), work rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation (SAO2), and heart rate (HR) were measured throughout the tests. The SaO2 of 11 patients at peak exercise was 90% or less (\"Low Sat\" group). The SaO2 of 23 patients remained above 90% throughout the exercise (\"High Sat\" group). Hyperoxic air minimized desaturation during exercise in the Low Sat group to 2 +/- 2% compared to a decrease of 10 +/- 5% with normoxic air. The decrease in saturation was not significant for the High Sat group (1 +/- 1% for both 21% and 30% O2). Peak work rate and VO2 did not differ significantly between normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. However, VE and HR at peak exercise tended to be lower, and PETCO2 was higher during peak exercise with 30% O2 than 21% O2 for both groups. During submaximal exercise, O2 desaturation was diminished and HR was significantly lower with supplemental O2, specifically in the Low Sat group. VE was significantly lower for both groups during submaximal exercise with hyperoxic air. The results suggest that O2 supplementation minimizes O2 desaturation and enables patients with CF to exercise with reduced ventilatory and cardiovascular work.\r"

Costs per case prevented were calculated for a 20-, 50-, and 70-yr-old low-risk patient who had a positive Mantoux test with base, high, and low costings. Rates were also calculated based on the use of direct costs alone and direct and indirect costs combined. Costs varied from Canadian $8,586.00 in a 20-yr-old patient to $40,102.00 in a 70-yr-old patient per case prevented based on direct costs with costs ranging from $3,236.00 to $11,320.00 with both direct and indirect costs included. These costs could be considered reasonable from a societal perspective but do not address the issue of any increased life expectancy resulting from chemoprophylaxis.\r"

Despite the presence of a regular respiratory pattern during wakefulness, NREM sleep was associated with the appearance of a sustained periodic respiratory pattern characterized by clusters of usually two breaths separated by an 8 to 10-s expiratory pause. At sleep onset, this Biot's respiratory pattern appeared immediately after a sigh. Breathing frequency during NREM sleep became regular with administration of supplemental O2 and an attendant increase in end-tidal CO2. Shortly after withdrawal of supplemental O2 during NREM sleep, the periodic pattern resumed and was again immediately preceded by a sigh. The observations during NREM sleep in this patient with a central nervous system abnormality indicate that Biot's type respiratory pattern may be reversed by administration of supplemental oxygen. The results in this patient suggest: (1) the presence of a very elevated CO2 apnea threshold, and (2) that the pons may play a role in determining the effect of hypercapnic hypoxia on respiratory pattern during sleep.\r"

Efficacy was assessed by comparing the results of programmed ventricular stimulation while patients received therapy with the results while they were drug free. SETTING: The electrophysiology laboratory of the University of California at San Francisco. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients with spontaneous or inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation for whom treatment with at least one class IA antiarrhythmic agent had failed. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with encainide, 35 to 50 mg three or four times daily, or flecainide, 100 to 200 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Arrhythmia worsened early in 5 of 16 patients receiving encainide and 3 of 33 patients receiving flecainide. Patients with poor left ventricular function were more likely to exhibit proarrhythmia (P = 0.02). Nine of eleven patients receiving encainide and 23 of 28 patients receiving flecainide who had repeat programmed ventricular stimulation while receiving drug therapy still had inducible, poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: Encainide and flecainide have a low efficacy rate and a high incidence of worsening of arrhythmia in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias, particularly when this condition is associated with poor left ventricular function.\r"

Low penicillin concentrations caused decreases equal to or higher than 99.9% in 11 strains, from 99.9 to 99.5% in 23 strains, and lower than 99.5% in 9 strains. Of the total strains, 14% were killed to the same extent by all concentrations above the MIC. The bactericidal activities of other beta-lactams (ampicillin and piperacillin) and other cell wall inhibitors (vancomycin and daptomycin) were also tested against some of these strains. In general, beta-lactams exhibited the best bactericidal activity at 2 x MIC. Piperacillin was the most active, as at 2 x MIC it reduced the original inoculum by 99.9% or more in most of the strains. No concentration of vancomycin above the MIC caused 99.9% killing of the strains, whereas daptomycin was bactericidal at 8 x MIC in most cases. Paradoxical response to bactericidal activity of beta-lactams was abolished by incubation of the inoculum with 2 x MIC before exposure to higher antibiotic concentrations. These findings suggest that enterococci are not always tolerant to cell wall-active antibiotics and that accurate in vitro bactericidal tests may be useful for the choice of appropriate therapy for infections caused by these microorganisms.\r"

The fingerprints of the penA genes of the 10 penicillin-susceptible strains were identical. In contrast, the fingerprints of the penA genes of all but two of the penicillin-resistant strains differed markedly from those of the penicillin-susceptible strains.

This probe hybridized to SHV-1 and poorly to LEN-1, but not to TEM-1 or a variety of other plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase genes, under stringent conditions. Screening of plasmid DNA derived from 40 ampicillin-resistant clinical isolates by Southern hybridization with the 223-bp probe uncovered no strains encoding OHIO-1. Isoelectric focusing of the same collection did identify two strains producing enzymes resembling SHV-1, however. We have also performed a kinetic comparison of OHIO-1, SHV-1, and TEM-1. OHIO-1 and SHV-1 were indistinguishable from each other but could be distinguished from TEM-1. These data clearly place OHIO-1 within the SHV-1 family of beta-lactamases.\r"

Therefore, recombinant human IFN-gamma was examined for its ability to clinically modify keloids. Subjects were treated by injection of either 0.01 or 0.1 mg of recombinant human IFN-gamma into one lesional site and diluent alone into another lesional site three times per week for 3 weeks. Keloids were measured and photographed before beginning therapy and weekly thereafter. Three days after the final injection, biopsies were performed on treated and control sites. Six of eight subjects who finished the course of treatment demonstrated reduction in size at the treated site with an average reduction in height of 30.4% vs 1.1% for control sites. Lesions treated with recombinant human IFN-gamma demonstrated alterations in both the epidermis and dermis. The epidermis showed thinning of the suprapapillary plates, compact hyperkeratosis, focal or diffuse parakeratosis, exocytosis of lymphocytes, and an increased quantity of mucin. The dermis contained a diminished quantity of thickened collagen bundles and active fibroblasts and an increased number of inflammatory cells and quantity of mucin. These results suggest the feasibility of using IFN-gamma in the treatment of abnormal fibrosis. Dose-ranging studies are required to establish whether IFN-gamma can fulfill a true clinical need in the treatment of keloidal scarring.\r"

Previously we showed that Kupffer cells (KC), the fixed macrophages of the liver, induce a profound decrease in hepatocyte (HC) total-protein synthesis when exposed to endotoxin. Furthermore we demonstrated that endotoxin-activated KCs induce these changes in HC protein synthesis through the induction of a novel L-arginine-dependent biochemical pathway within the HC. In this pathway, the guanido nitrogen of L-arginine is converted to the highly reactive molecule nitric oxide (NO.). To identify the KC factors that act as signals for induction of HC NO. biosynthesis, recombinant cytokines were added to HC cultures and HC nitrogen oxide production and protein synthesis levels were determined. We found that no single cytokine, but rather a specific combination of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, interferon-gamma, and endotoxin, were required for maximal induction of HC nitrogen oxide production. This specific combination of cytokines induced a 248.8 +/- 26.0 mumol/L (micromolar) increase in HC nitrogen oxide production and simultaneously inhibited HC total protein synthesis by 36.1% +/- 3.1%. These data demonstrate that multiple cytokines, produced by endotoxin-activated KC, induce the production of NO. within HC, which in turn leads to the inhibition of HC total-protein synthesis.\r"

Most cases of active tuberculosis were among homeless men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex; and significant CD4 lymphocyte depletion was associated with active tuberculosis. Total time homeless correlated positively with active and latent tuberculosis infection. Compliance rates with return for HIV antibody test results, medications, and follow-up visits were 70%, suggesting a significant degree of knowledge, awareness, and personal concern regarding HIV infection among homeless men; yet 28% of homeless intravenous drug users continue active drug injection, despite HIV infection. Cohabitation in overcrowded congregate dormitories creates a risk of airborne transmission of tuberculosis, which is a common reactivation infection in HIV-seropositive homeless men. Medically appropriate housing should be provided to such homeless persons, and expanded HIV antibody testing, counseling, and medical services on site should be offered to residents of shelters.\r"

In seven (64%) of the 11 patients, an incorrect diagnosis was initially made. Cough, mostly nonproductive, was invariably present, and general symptoms (fever, anorexia, weight loss) predominated over specific pulmonary symptoms. The radiographic features were rather \"unusual\": in only two (18%) of the 11 cases, apicoposterior consolidations with or without cavitation were found. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed a range of endobronchial abnormalities that included ulcerations, mass lesions, and fibrostenoses. Antituberculous treatment generally led to satisfactory results. Still, residual bronchostenosis was observed in four (57%) of seven patients in whom a control bronchoscopy was done. In one of these four patients, a pneumonectomy had to be performed for uncontrollable retro-obstructive infections, and in another, repeated endoscopic dilatations were effective. In elderly patients, endobronchial tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in the presence of chronic cough. In these patients, the chest roentgenogram may be clear or suggestive of bronchial carcinoma or pneumonitis.\r"

The number of samples positive for mycobacteria increased from 128 (4.3%) of 2956 during the 1975 through 1978 study period to 197 (8.4%) of 2347 during the 1979 through 1982 study period. Of 47 positive smears during the first study period, only one was a false-positive. None of 96 positive smears during the second period was a false-positive. The positive predictive value of acid-fast microscopy was 97.9% and 100% for the two periods examined.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was begun at 52 +/- 36 hours of age with an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 36 +/- 14 mm Hg despite maximal pharmacologic and ventilator support (inspired fraction of oxygen [FiO2], 0.99 +/- 0.03; respiratory rate, 98 +/- 31/min; and positive inspiratory pressure, 54 +/- 11 cm of water). With initial flows of 130 +/- 17 mL/kg per minute, ventilator settings were reduced to the following: FiO2, 0.30; respiratory rates, 15/min; and positive inspiratory pressure, 24 cm of water. Support using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was gradually reduced to 22% of initial flows and arterial blood samples showed pH 7.48 +/- .05, PO2 of 106 +/- 27 mm Hg, and PCO2 of 36 +/- 5 mm Hg just prior to decannulation. After 107 +/- 45 hours, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was stopped and infants were extubated 61 +/- 53 hours (median, 46 hours) afterward. There was one death (94.4% survival rate); all survivors were discharged and underwent a follow-up examination at 1 to 27 months of age. Complications included two intracranial hemorrhages (one death and one asymptomatic), one patent ductus arteriosus requiring ligation on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and chronic lung disease in one patient. In selected neonates, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation allows for resolution of pulmonary hypertension, results in improved survival, and is associated with a low incidence of chronic lung disease. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered in the treatment of severe respiratory failure.\r"

Review of 30 cases of this syndrome, defined as progressive ataxia and myoclonus and infrequent seizures in the absence of dementia, showed that a clinical or biochemically supported diagnosis could not be made in 43%. This low diagnostic yield probably reflects differences in ascertainment of patients; those described here were referred with a syndrome of progressive myoclonic ataxia (the Ramsay Hunt syndrome) rather than progressive myoclonus epilepsy. These two syndromes share common causes, but a smaller proportion of patients with progressive myoclonic ataxia can currently be diagnosed precisely during life.\r"

Rabbit eyes underwent complete tarsorrhaphy for 7 days either with (group A, n = 14) or without (group B, n = 13) new sterile soft contact lenses. On day 7, an increase in mean corneal thickness (20.3% in group A and 17.2% in group B) was detected. New or rabbit-worn soft contact lenses were then inoculated with 10(7) colony-forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or by 0.1 mL of P aeruginosa suspension. On day 9, conjunctival cultures of all eyes yielded P aeruginosa. Corneal infection developed in 11 of 14 eyes wearing new or worn, contaminated soft contact lenses. Bacterial keratitis did not develop in any of the 13 eyes inoculated with P aeruginosa suspension. Light and electron microscopy of infected eyes showed abundant polymorphonuclear neutrophils destroying the epithelium, basement membrane, and stroma. Few bacteria could be detected and only in the deep stroma. Since bacterial suspension alone caused no inflammation, soft contact lens-wear appears crucial to corneal infection in this model.\r"

All 3 were stimulated by rHuIL-1 beta and rHuTNF alpha alone, but not by rHu gamma-IFN. Stimulation with rHuIL-1 beta and rHuTNF alpha occurred at femtomolar and picomolar concentrations, respectively, and maximal stimulation by rHuIL-1 beta was several times greater than that by rHuTNF alpha. Stimulation of PGE and collagenase production with rHuIL-1 beta or rHuTNF alpha was depressed by rHu gamma-IFN, depending on the concentration used. In contrast, stimulation of HA production with rHuIL-1 beta or rHuTNF alpha was unaffected or increased somewhat with rHu gamma-IFN. Combinations of rHuIL-1 beta or rHuTNF alpha had marked synergistic effects on PGE and collagenase production. However, when rHuIL-1 beta effects were maximal, rHuTNF alpha had an additive effect. These cytokines had only additive effects on HA production, however, and when rHuIL-1 beta effects were maximal, rHuTNF alpha produced no further stimulation. These data suggest that the secretory activities of synovial fibroblasts can be influenced by a combination of cytokines and is dependent on the type of cytokine present and its concentration.\r"

The increase in HDL-C appeared to be mainly attributed to the HDL2-C subfraction which increased by 15.3% (P = 0.066). Furthermore, the increases in HDL-C, HDL2-C and TG were more pronounced in the middle-aged men then in the young men. After fasting overnight the effects of alcohol had disappeared.\r"

Blood pressure (mean +/- SEM) fell from 143 +/- 1/96 +/- 1 to 134 +/- 1/86 +/- 1 mm Hg after 4 to 5 months of prazosin treatment (P less than .001), associated with an increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration from 38 +/- 2 to 46 +/- 2 mg/dL (P less than .001). Both the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and total synthetic rate of apoAI/HDL, which were higher than previous reported values for normal individuals, decreased from 0.36 +/- 0.02 to 0.30 +/- 0.02 L/day and 17.4 +/- 1.1 to 13.8 +/- 1.1 mg/kg/min, respectively. These changes were statistically significant, and the post-treatment values for both variables were now within the normal range. When the decay curve was further analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting, it was shown that the return to normal of the FCR of apoAI/HDL in patients treated with prazosin was accounted for by the decrease of the decay constants of the second [p(2)] and third [p(3)] components of the 125I-AI/HDL disappearance curve. In conclusion, abnormalities in HDL concentration and HDL kinetics exist in patients with very mild hypertension. These defects were significantly improved with prazosin treatment, and this may render the compound of particular clinical benefit in the treatment of patients with mild hypertension.\r"

This report describes efforts to elucidate the mechanism by which NPY produces this effect. The response of the perfused rabbit ear artery to brief intermittent field stimulation was significantly enhanced by NPY (100 nmol/L). The administration of indomethacin (10 mumol/L) to inhibit cyclooxygenase did not affect the ability of NPY to potentiate neurogenic vasoconstriction. Blockade of calcium channels with nifedipine (1 mumol/L) produced a partial attenuation of the NPY effect. Our studies therefore suggest that an arachidonic acid metabolite is not involved in NPY induced potentiation of vascular neuroeffector transmission in the rabbit ear artery. On the other hand, the translocation of extracellular calcium may play a role in this process.\r"

Eight additional cases were studied with a different protocol. Alpha-h-ANP was infused at the dose of 50 ng/kg/min over 1 h, after a bolus of 50 micrograms; saline alone was infused as control. Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, cortisol, serum and urinary Na and K and urinary volume were measured. A slight fall in blood pressure, without heart rate changes, was obtained within the first 5 min; this lasted throughout the infusion and for 1 h afterwards. Urinary volume and urinary sodium were significantly higher than controls during the first 2 h, while urinary potassium slightly increased only during the first hour. Plasma renin activity remained suppressed. Plasma aldosterone levels were similar throughout the infusion. Cortisol was not significantly different than placebo except that there was a significant rise after stopping ANP.

UK 69,578 is a novel atriopeptidase inhibitor that raises plasma levels of ANF in animals and normal volunteers, with associated diuresis and natriuresis. This study examines the effects of UK 69,578 in patients with mild heart failure. UK 69,578 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 min in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study to six patients with stable (NYHA Class 2) chronic heart failure. The atriopeptidase inhibitor was well tolerated and no side effects were encountered. Mean baseline plasma ANF was elevated at 88 pg/mL (normal less than 50), and increased 2- to 5-fold after UK 69,578 administration. Plasma ANF did not change significantly following placebo. There was a marked diuresis after UK 69,578 compared to placebo. Urinary sodium excretion doubled for 4 to 6 h, but there was no significant rise in potassium excretion. There was no increase in plasma active renin concentration during the study period. Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring revealed no significant changes in heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, or echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions. However, invasive measurements using a Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrated falls in mean right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressures after UK 69,578. There was no change in cardiac output. Thus, inhibition of endopeptidase 24:11 by UK 69,578 results in significant elevation of plasma ANF, with associated diuresis, natriuresis and venodilatation. The compound was well tolerated in these patients with mild chronic heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of the ventricle in ANP secretion, the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration in the plasma, left atrial tissue and left ventricular tissue were observed in a canine during the course of experimental reversible mitral regurgitation (MR). For reversible MR, a basket catheter was inserted into the left atrium via the pulmonary vein and fixed at the mitral valve. The regurgitation arose when the tip basket wire was extended and disappeared immediately when it was closed. Left atrial pressure (LAP), right atrial pressure (RAP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) increased significantly during MR, and decreased to the normal level after recovery from MR. Plasma ANP concentration showed a reversible change in correlation with LAP and RAP in each canine studied. The ANP level in the atrial and ventricular tissue decreased during MR, and the low levels were maintained after recovery from MR. Both the left arterial and left ventricular tissue ANP levels showed the same changes in acute MR. Therefore, it was suggested that normal ventricles might play a role in ANP secretion in acute MR.\r"

  ".W": "In response to a meat meal containing 125 mEq of sodium, conscious dogs (n = 5) with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and chronic compensated heart failure exhibited temporally related increases in postprandial plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF), right atrial pressure, and sodium excretion. In separate experiments, two weeks of dietary sodium restriction produced similar marked stimulation of renin and aldosterone both in normal dogs (n = 5), and in AV fistula dogs (n = 5) with chronic high circulating levels of ANF. Plasma iANF did not change (P greater than .05) in either group. These results suggest that the ANF system is involved in the postprandial regulation of sodium excretion in the AV fistula dogs with compensated heart failure. In the postabsorptive state, however, the activity of the renin-aldosterone axis is closely related to dietary sodium intake and appears to function independently of the ANF system for the prevention of sodium loss.\r"

  ".W": "Human recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) restricted viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus- (HIV) infected T cells and monocytes. With T cells, reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in culture fluids was reduced threefold from that of control infected cells by IFN treatment, but HIV p24 antigen levels were unchanged. In contrast, levels of p24 antigen and RT activity in lysates of IFN-treated infected cells were threefold greater than those of controls. These differences suggest that the mechanism for IFN-induced antiviral effects in HIV-infected T cells resides in the terminal events (assembly and release) of the virus replication cycle. Monocytes treated with IFN at the time of virus challenge showed no p24 antigen or RT activity, no HIV-specific mRNA, and no proviral DNA in cells for up to 3 weeks after infection. IFN treatment of chronically infected monocytes also decreased virus replication, as assessed by p24 antigen, mRNA and RT detection assays. However, levels of proviral DNA in the IFN-treated and control HIV-infected cells were indistinguishable. The presence of large quantities of proviral DNA in cells with little or no evidence for active transcription documents a situation approaching true microbiological latency.\r"

Accordingly, we have undertaken a study to evaluate their susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Five-day-old primary cultures of Kupffer cells (KC) were infected with HIV-1, and as the infection progressed, syncytia appeared. Within the cells, viral proteins were detected by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies directed against gp120 and p24. Electron microscopic examinations revealed the presence of typical Lentivirinae particles. The particles released from KC in the extracellular medium showed reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen; they could infect lymphocytic cells and were neutralized by a HIV+ patient's serum or an anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody. Our results thus demonstrate that the interaction of HIV-1 with KC in vitro leads to a productive infection. They suggest that the KC may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and may (i) participate in the transmission of the infection to the peripheral blood cells, (ii) play a role in the depletion of uninfected CD4+ cells.\r"

  ".W": "Alteplase (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA)) was infused within four hours of onset of symptoms in 286 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Delayed coronary angiography was performed 72 hours after admission with coronary angioplasty if indicated. Electrocardiographic monitoring was continuous during the first hour of treatment. The sum of the ST segment elevations (sigma ST) was calculated on electrocardiograms recorded at entry and an hour later. ST elevations resolved rapidly within one hour of treatment in 189 patients and persisted in 97 patients. Rapid resolution of ST elevation correlated with angiographic coronary patency as determined by coronary angiography 72 hours after admission. The patients with rapid resolution of sigma ST had significantly smaller infarcts and a better clinical outcome than the patients with persistent ST elevation. sigma ST values at entry and one hour after treatment had no additional independent predictive value. Rapid resolution of ST elevations in patients undergoing thrombolysis with alteplase was associated with a significantly smaller release of creatine kinase, better preservation of left ventricular function, lower morbidity, and less short and long term mortality. Rapid resolution of sigma ST elevation is an efficient indicator of clinical outcome in groups of patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing thrombolysis with alteplase.\r"

The mean umbilical venous PO2 was greater in group 100 for emergency sections (P = 0.001). Babies born to mothers in group 100 required less resuscitation than those in group 50 (P = 0.04) and there was a tendency to higher Apgar scores at 1 min in group 100, although this was not statistically significant. There were no instances of awareness, although two patients in group 100 and three in group 50 reported dreaming. This study confirms earlier findings that the use of 100% oxygen can significantly improve fetal oxygenation during Caesarean section, with particular benefit in emergency cases. This is associated with a lower incidence of neonatal resuscitation.\r"

Administration of frusemide was associated with more frequent need for i.v. volume expansion after operation. Plasma osmolality was greater with mannitol (289 (SD 4.2 mosmol kg-1 at 1 h after operation and 285 (5.3) mosmol kg-1 at 4 h after operation) than with frusemide (282 (7.1) mosmol kg-1 and 279 (6.7) mosmol kg-1, respectively) (P less than 0.05). Plasma concentration of sodium was significantly greater with mannitol (136.9 (3.1) mmol litre-1) than with frusemide (134.4 (2.8) mmol litre-1) only on the morning after surgery (P less than 0.05). Mannitol is an effective alternative to frusemide in inducing diuresis after prostatectomy, and may protect against water intoxication.\r"

Isradipine was given as a slow injection in doses of 0.5 mg (10 women), 1 mg (11 women), and 1.5 mg (6 women). A reduction of systolic (6-16%) and diastolic (19-22%) blood pressure was seen, and concomitantly there was an increase in maternal (29-34%) and fetal (3-10%) heart rates. Reduction in uterine activity was not dose-related (maximum reduction 17%). Side effects (headache, palpitations) were minor and well tolerated. One women in the high-dose group had a shortlasting episode of hypotension. The results suggest that isradipine given as a bolus dose decreases blood pressure in pregnant women with little effects on uterine activity and fetal heart rate.\r"

  ".W": "Several different proto-oncogenes have been shown to influence cellular differentiation. One of the most widely studied model systems has been the Friend murine erythroleukemia cell (F-MELC) line, which can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by a variety of chemical agents. Constitutive overexpression of either the c-myc or c-myb proto-oncogenes has been previously shown to inhibit F-MELC differentiation, whereas c-myc antisense sequences accelerate the process. To investigate the potential involvement of other proto-oncogenes and immediate early response genes in F-MELC differentiation, we studied the expression of the three known members of the jun family as well as another gene, egr-1, which, like the jun family members, is expressed as an immediate early response gene in growth factor-stimulated quiescent cells. All four genes were expressed in F-MELC, although the levels of expression and modes of regulation differed. Transfection with amplifiable c-jun, junB, or junD expression plasmids inhibited differentiation, whereas transfection with an egr-1 expression plasmid was without effect. These results indicate that jun family members play a role in mediating F-MELC differentiation. The known inhibitory effect of phorbol ester tumor promoters on F-MELC differentiation may be the result of their known stimulation of jun expression.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases. The neurosurgical budget should be assessed in the context of managing a patient in hospital and subsequently in the community.\r"

  ".W": "Previous retrospective studies have suggested an association between consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the complications of diverticular disease. Ninety-two patients were entered into a prospective study of the complications of diverticular disease over a 3 year period; 31 were taking NSAIDs, compared with only four age- and sex-matched controls from a representative general practice (P less than 0.001). A second control group comprised 306 patients with cancer of the colon in whom NSAID consumption was again significantly lower than in patients with diverticular disease (22 of 306 versus 31 of 92, P less than 0.001). Of the 31 patients taking NSAIDs, 19 presented with a perforation or peritonitis. By contrast, only eight of the 61 patients not taking NSAIDs had such complications (P less than 0.001). Eleven patients presented with bleeding of whom five were taking NSAIDs and six were not. Patients admitted with complications of diverticular disease have a high incidence of NSAID intake, and it appears that NSAID consumption is associated with a more severe form of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The economic aspects of trauma centres were examined using published results and local financial data to discover if such institutions are an efficient use of resources. The cost of trauma centre care depends upon the number of centres built. An 'ideal' system in the UK of eight centres will cost 31.268 pounds per life saved compared with 45.661 pounds for the system proposed by the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Trauma centre care will be expensive but will generate benefits in return. Survivors will be young (mean age 30 years) and most (70-80 per cent) will regain their pre-injury functional/work status. When considered in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QUALYs), trauma centres are a relatively efficient use of resources. An expected cost per QUALY of 942-1376 pounds is inexpensive compared with many health pursuits currently funded within the UK National Health Service.\r"
