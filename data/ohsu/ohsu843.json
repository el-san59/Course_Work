Noninvasive microvascular measurements during distant cooling and inspiratory gasp revealed signs of sympathetic denervation. The initially elevated total skin blood flow measured by laser Doppler equipment and decreased capillary perfusion as determined by transcutaneous oxygen tension measurements were both partially restored after treatment with the alpha 1-sympathicomimetic ephedrine. The improvement occurred once more after rechallenge. In conclusion this study further supports the hypothesis of a capillary steal phenomenon caused by extreme vasodilation within sympathetically denervated arteriovenous shunt vessels.\r"

Twelve symptomless rhinitic and/or asthmatic patients with previously demonstrated bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine were treated with placebo or nisoldipine (10 mg) according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study design. Airway reactivity was examined through changes in response to methacholine challenge three hours after drug or placebo administration. Nisoldipine, in comparison to placebo, produced a weak but significant rise of provocative dose of methacholine responsible for a 15% fall in FEV1 (P less than .01). The data suggest that a single dose of 10 mg of nisoldipine is able partially to counteract methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in atopic subjects with nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness.\r"

This diagnosis was compared with results obtained with PRIST and with a new commercially available multi-RAST test for inhalant allergy, Phadiatop (Pharmacia). Sixty subjects (20%), including all 49 allergic subjects, scored positive in the Phadiatop assay (100% sensitivity) while PRIST (cut-off 220 IU/mL) identified only 20/49 allergics (40.8% sensitivity). The correlation between RAST and Phadiatop was excellent. Phadiatop is much more sensitive than PRIST; furthermore, Phadiatop is easier, less expensive, and as reliable as RAST for use in mass screening programs.\r"

In the United States this increase is concentrated in the large metropolitan counties. Second, the disease formerly considered bronchospasm and bronchial hyperresponsiveness has become recognized as a particular kind of desquamating eosinophilic bronchitis. Third, helper T lymphocytes, particularly those that produce interleukins 3, 4, and 5 seem to play a central role in the pathogenesis of this inflammation. In this essay, I will expound on these points and speculate on their interpretation and where future research may be fruitful in providing better understanding of the disease. The ultimate goal is to suggest a theoretical basis for developing better treatment.\r"

  ".U": "90087460\r", 
  ".W": "Although asthma is a complex and multifactorial disease, a relationship between atopic allergic sensitization to common aeroallergens and asthma has been recognized for decades. This recognition has not led to a widespread immunologic orientation to asthma diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes older epidemiologic evidence using historical data and skin tests that associate IgE-mediated events with asthma, and presents more recent studies utilizing in vitro testing to study new subject groups, to demonstrate that in certain situations up to 75% to 100% of the cases of chronic asthma, as well as many acute episodes, have an allergic etiology. Thus the old distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic asthma should be discarded in favor of an aggressive search for allergic factors in virtually any patient with asthma. A theoretic basis for the allergic etiology of asthma has arisen from recent studies linking (1) IgE antibody production with cytophilic sensitization of mast cells and possibly other proinflammatory cell types bearing IgE receptors; (2) IgE-dependent, allergen-induced immediate bronchial reactions with late-phase reactions; and (3) occurrence of late-phase reactions with persistent local inflammation and increased nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity. Understanding of the allergic etiology of asthma in turn gives rise to renewed emphasis upon immunomodulatory approaches to treatment. At present these include allergen avoidance measures that reduce natural exposure and conventional high-dose allergen injection immunotherapy, both of which have well-documented efficacy when properly applied. In the future, better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of asthma, in particular the events of the late-phase reaction, are likely to lead to new approaches to treatment based upon rational modulation of these events, possibly with recombinant cytokine-based therapy or synthetic peptide antagonists of defined mediator molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Morbidity and mortality from asthma have been increasing in the United States and other countries. Although the reason for these changes is unknown, there are a number of possibilities. Authoritative reviews of epidemics of asthma deaths in other countries have focused on patient management, particularly the failure of patients and physicians to recognize the severity of the patients' asthma. Of great concern, however, has been the possibility that increases in asthma mortality reflect changes in the way that physicians treat asthma; most notably the use of multiple drug regimens (sometimes inappropriately) and dependence on inhaled beta agonists. Since most asthmatic patients are effectively and safely managed with present therapeutic modalities, it is essential that features that distinguish the fatality-prone asthmatic be characterized as distinctly as possible. It is reasonable to conclude that such a patient may be the patient whose asthma is not well defined, sometimes in terms of the diagnosis but more often in terms of the severity of their condition. This may be associated with a failure to utilize pulmonary function tests, and result in lack of an appropriate plan of action for exacerbations of asthma through cooperative management. As a result, there may be underutilization of corticosteroids, which are necessary for the treatment of inflammation associated with chronic asthma. Misunderstanding about the need to avoid external triggers and treat internal precipitants as well as inability to recognize the potential for medication-induced adverse effects may further characterize the fatality-prone asthmatic. Further studies are needed to confirm or to refute the speculative association between current management of asthmatic patients and morbidity and mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite effective pharmacologic therapy, asthma remains a common cause of emergency room and hospital admissions, and mortality due to asthma is increasing. Asthma deaths often are related to failure on the part of patients or their physicians to appreciate the severity of their illness. Subjective assessment of the severity of airflow obstruction is unreliable and actual measurement of airflow and arterial blood gases should be utilized initially, as well as during therapy. An increasing awareness of the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of asthma has led to pharmacologic therapy aimed both at producing bronchodilation and at reducing inflammation. Aggressive therapy with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists and systemic corticosteroids remains the mainstay of treatment for acute asthma. Some patients may benefit from the addition of anticholinergic therapy and/or theophylline. If mechanical ventilation is required, controlled hypoventilation may decrease the incidence of pulmonary barotrauma. Although inhaled corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium, antihistamines and calcium-channel blockers are not effective in the treatment of acute asthma, inhaled steroids should probably be used in the recovery phase of most hospitalized asthmatics to decrease the bronchial hyperreactivity associated with airway inflammation.\r"

Although theophylline remains a highly effective medication, corticosteroid aerosols and cromolyn are gaining in popularity and beta adrenergic agonists with longer and longer duration of action continue to be of major importance for first line treatment. Oral corticosteroids remain invaluable in the treatment of severe asthma. The role of other agents such as anticholinergics, antihistamines and products undergoing development might serve to change our therapy in the future. Physicians should not be hesitant to adapt if new concepts regarding pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic management suggests need for a modification of our present conceptualization of what's best for our patients.\r"

Long-term studies in a large number of patients in phase III are designed to demonstrate the long-term safety and continued efficacy of the drug. Following review and acceptance that the data generated during these two developmental periods and submitted by the sponsor under an NDA demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug, the drug may be approved for marketing. If so, there will be continued evaluation of the drug during postmarketing surveillance. The phases of study that are required to demonstrate that a new drug is safe and efficacious are straightforward and clearly defined. The methods that are best used to satisfy these requirements are less clear and more open to interpretation by both sponsors and Agency reviewers. Guidelines for the testing of new drugs are extremely helpful in this regard, but will never (and probably never should) take the place of enlightened individual judgment on the part of investigators, sponsors, and FDA reviewers.\r"

Injuries typically occur in the nondominant hand of patients using industrial equipment in the workplace. Tissue damage is produced by the delivery of both kinetic energy and foreign substances into the hand. The initial clinical course can be deceptively benign and lead to delay in instituting therapy. Early conservative management dramatically increases the likelihood that the injured part will eventually require amputation. Thorough examination for functional and structural impairment is mandated. Aggressive and definitive operative debridement is then undertaken. Postoperatively, a physical program of early mobilization is warranted to prevent fibrosis and the formation of contractures. Although the institution of prophylactic antibiotics is warranted the use of corticosteroids in the management of these injuries remains controversial.\r"

The overall recurrence rate was 2.5 per cent, superior to other methods of primary repair, and equal or superior to Marlex mesh repair. Wound infection occurred in 5 per cent. The risk of wound infection was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in patients with a history of prior wound infection. We conclude that the internal retention method of primary repair of ventral hernia for defects less than 18 cm in diameter is equal to Marlex in the repair of previously infected recurrent hernias of this size.\r"

Randomized studies of the use of either thiazides or allopurinol suggest a modest beneficial effect of about 35% over placebo. Considering that the risk of this specific therapy is about 5%, the morbidity associated with renal stones is limited, and relatively less invasive procedures can often replace nephrolithotomy, we conclude that use of specific drug therapy, namely thiazides or allopurinol, is not warranted in patients with a first kidney stone and, therefore, that extensive metabolic evaluation is unnecessary.\r"

More than 70% of bleeding episodes occur at vascular puncture sites. Hypofibrinogenemia and elevation of fibrinogen degradation products have been weakly correlated with the risk of hemorrhage. Although depletion of factors V and VIII may occur, the role of such depletion in bleeding is unknown. Several in-vitro studies have shown plasmin-induced platelet dysfunction, but clinical data are limited. Nevertheless, the role of platelet inhibition should be considered because many patients are treated with antiplatelet agents. Most patients who have bleeding can be managed by interruption of thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy, volume replacement, and manual pressure applied to an incompetent vessel. Protamine should be considered if heparin has been administered within 4 hours of the onset of bleeding. In the few patients who fail to respond to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. Transfusion of cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory reassessment after each administration. A target fibrinogen level of 1 g/L is desirable with cryoprecipitate infusion. Antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. We have developed an algorithm for using these products.\r"

PATIENTS: Hemodialysis patients (333) with uncomplicated anemia (hematocrit less than 0.30). All received rHuEpo intravenously, three times per week at 300 or 150 U/kg body weight, which was then reduced to 75 U/kg and adjusted to maintain the hematocrit at 0.35 +/- 0.03 (SD). RESULTS: The baseline hematocrit (0.223 +/- 0.002) increased to 0.35, more than 0.06 over baseline within 12 weeks in 97.4% of patients. Erythrocyte transfusions (1030 within the 6 months before rHuEpo therapy) were eliminated in all patients within 2 months of therapy. Sixty-eight patients with iron overload had a 39% reduction in serum ferritin levels after 6 months of therapy. The median maintenance dose of rHuEpo was 75 U/kg, three times per week (range, 12.5 to 525 U/kg). Nonresponders had complicating causes for anemia, myelofibrosis, osteitis fibrosa, osteomyelitis, and acute or chronic blood loss. Adverse effects included myalgias, 5%; iron deficiency, 43%; increased blood pressure, 35%; and seizures, 5.4%. The creatinine, potassium, and phosphate levels increased slightly but significantly. The platelet count increased slightly but there was no increase in clotting of vascular accesses. CONCLUSIONS: The anemia of hemodialysis patients is corrected by rHuEpo resulting in the elimination of transfusions, reduction in iron overload, and improved quality of life. Iron stores and blood pressure must be monitored and treated to maintain the effectiveness of rHuEpo and to minimize the threat of hypertensive encephalopathy.\r"

DESIGN: Double-blinded, placebo-controlled 3-year trial of supplementation with calcium (1000 mg/d) and cholecalciferol (25 micrograms/d). SETTING: Clinical research center at a university medical facility. SUBJECTS: Normal men 30 to 87 years old, recruited from the Portland community. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Radial bone mineral content (assessed by single-photon absorptiometry) fell by 1.0%/y (95% CI, -1.3% to 0.7%) at a proximal radial site and 1.0%/y (95% CI, -1.4% to -0.6%) at a distal radial site. Vertebral bone mineral content (assessed by dual-energy quantitative computed tomography) declined by 2.3%/y (95% CI, -2.8% to -1.8%). In these healthy men with a high basal dietary calcium intake (1159 mg/d), calcium and cholecalciferol supplementation did not affect bone loss at any site. CONCLUSIONS: Normal men experience a substantial bone loss at both axial and appendicular sites that is not prevented by calcium and vitamin D supplementation in a well-nourished population.\r"

We discuss the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the causative agent of AIDS, on the field of nephrology. Hyponatremia, the commonest fluid and electrolyte abnormality, is caused by various pathophysiologic mechanisms, including adrenal insufficiency. The renal parenchymal complications are diverse, but a new entity, HIV-associated nephropathy, is becoming recognized because of its characteristic clinical and pathologic features, including the fact that it causes irreversible renal failure. HIV infection in patients with end-stage renal failure, both before and after initiation of maintenance dialysis, is a significant problem. The present methods of preventing spread of virus in dialysis units seem successful. Few patients who are infected with HIV or who have AIDS have had renal transplantation, although unsuspected viral infection of cadaveric organs remains a concern.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To identify advances in drug therapy for inflammatory bowel disease, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the new agents in treating both ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published from January 1980 through June 1989 were identified using MEDLINE and through extensive hand searching of bibliographies in identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: One hundred and ten articles directly related to the topic were found and analyzed. Another 42 articles were relevant to the material reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were selected on the basis of study quality and their significance with regard to treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: The aminosalicylates are emerging as effective and safe therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. Corticotropin can be considered the drug of choice for certain patients with severe ulcerative colitis, and new rapidly metabolized topical steroids appear to be as effective as traditional forms and have fewer side effects. Immunosuppressive agents, including 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, may be useful in treating difficult-to-manage patients with either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis, whereas cyclosporine appears promising but should be reserved for patients in whom other measures have failed. Patients with refractory perineal Crohn disease and those with Crohn colitis may benefit from metronidazole. Many other drugs including clonidine, cromoglycate, chloroquine, fish oil, methotrexate, antituberculous agents, interferon, and superoxide dismutase have shown enough promise in preliminary studies to warrant controlled clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Drug therapy for inflammatory bowel disease, limited for many years to sulfasalazine and some corticosteroids, has been extended to include the aminosalicylates, rapidly metabolized topical steroids, immunosuppressive agents, and metronidazole. Potentially useful newer drugs await further study.\r"

DESIGN: Longitudinal descriptive study. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient services of a university medical center. PARTICIPANTS: All trainees and attending staff working at the service sites were invited to participate; 158 (84%) did so. INTERVENTIONS: Free online access was provided to MEDLINE through GRATEFUL MED software. Participants were offered a 2-hour introduction to online searching and 2 hours of free search time. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For each search, a computer program requested identification of the user and the question to be addressed. Search transactions were recorded automatically. Interviews were conducted after a random sample of searches, and search questions were given to more expert searchers to run for comparison with the original. Eighty-one percent of participants did searches on study computers, at a mean rate of 2.7 searches per month. On comparison searches, participants retrieved 55% of the number of relevant articles retrieved by reference librarians (P = 0.024) and 50% more irrelevant articles (P less than 0.001). Forty-seven percent of searches on patient problems affected clinical decisions, but often on scanty information. CONCLUSIONS: MEDLINE searching from clinical settings is feasible with brief training and affects clinical decisions. However, inexperienced searchers miss many relevant citations and search inefficiently. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of searching on physician performance and patient care.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four patients, 16 male and 8 female, underwent a total of 35 operations for pulmonary aspergillosis. Intrapulmonary aspergilloma was detected in 19, and Aspergillus empyema was present in 5. The major operative procedures performed were pneumonectomy in 2 patients, lobectomy in 8, segmentectomy in 1, cavernostomy in 4, and open-window thoracostomy in 5. The surgical results in 5 patients 70 years old or older were excellent. Empyema developed postoperatively in 2 patients who had undergone wedge resection of the lung or segmentectomy. Although resection involving the minimum extent possible is desirable in the treatment of intrapulmonary aspergilloma so as not to decrease lung function, it is dangerous to perform a limited procedure in the case of aspergilloma with an invasive character. In patients in poor general condition, cavernostomy followed by muscle flap plombage is recommended. For Aspergillus empyema, the primary procedure was open-window thoracostomy followed by plombage using chest wall muscle or omentum. We consider omental flap plombage to be superior to thoracoplasty in some respects for mycotic empyema, especially because it is a less extensive surgical procedure.\r"

Twenty patients were operated on with pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (group I) and 18, with nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (group II). Hyperglycemia was observed during and early after operation in both groups. In group I during cardiopulmonary bypass, the immunoreactive insulin and c-peptide levels and the insulin to glucagon molar ratio increased significantly compared with the preoperative values, but in group II, these variables did not alter significantly. An hour postoperatively, the immunoreactive insulin (71 +/- 34 muIU/mL) and c-peptide (8.3 +/- 3.0 ng/mL) levels and the insulin to glucagon molar ratio (11.0 +/- 5.2) in group I were significantly higher than those in group II (immunoreactive insulin, 29 +/- 20 muIU/mL; c-peptide, 4.8 +/- 1.8 ng/mL; insulin to glucagon molar ratio, 3.4 +/- 2.6). The blood lactate level in group I (41 +/- 22 mg/dL) was significantly lower than that in group II (78 +/- 30 mg/dL) an hour postoperatively. In conclusion, pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass is quite effective in preserving pancreatic beta cell function and tissue metabolism during and early after open heart procedures.\r"

On each occasion the pericardium was closed with a patch of bovine pericardium. In all cases, the patch was frozen to the inner aspect of the sternum, increasing the difficulty of resternotomy. Histological examinations of the patches confirmed dense fibrous connective tissue, patchy calcification, and foreign body giant cell reaction. Bovine pericardium appears to increase the difficulty of repeat cardiac operations. We recommend its use be discontinued.\r"

Mean blood pressure was reduced from 200 (+/- 3)/129 (+/- 1) mm Hg to 149 (+/- 2)/101 (+/- 1) mm Hg, a mean reduction of 51/28 mm Hg. The therapeutic goal was established as a reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure to less than 100 mm Hg or a reduction of at least 30 mm Hg. This was achieved in 62 (61%) of 101 patients, with an additional 7 patients having a final supine diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg. Treatment with dilevalol was less successful in black male patients than in the group at large. There was a tendency for older patients to respond better than younger patients. Prior recent treatment of patients with beta-adrenergic antagonists decreased the effectiveness of the drug. Significant orthostatic hypotension was not noted. Sixty-four patients were transferred to oral dilevalol treatment in combination with a diuretic, and blood pressure in this group averaged 160/100 mm Hg after 1 month of therapy. Dilevalol appears to be a safe and effective drug that can be used intravenously successfully in the majority of patients with severe hypertension and provides an alternative to therapy with other agents. It also is a useful agent for oral treatment of these patients after successful intravenous therapy.\r"

Six prehospital- and eight hospital-phase RCTs that randomized totals of 7656 and 1407 patients, respectively, were selected and reviewed in a blinded fashion. Mortality data were evaluated according to therapy type, reporting interval, and patient category. The prehospital-phase RCTs showed no meaningful mortality effect (risk difference, 0.0184; 95% confidence interval, -0.048 to +0.012). The hospital-phase RCTs showed a statistically significant increase in mortality during the treatment period for lidocaine recipients (risk difference, 0.029; 95% confidence interval, +0.004 to +0.055). These results confirm that lidocaine administered to monitored patients during the prehospital phase of AMI will not reduce mortality by a clinically important amount and suggest that lidocaine administered in the hospital phase of monitored, uncomplicated AMI may increase mortality among recipients with proved AMI.\r"

With this system a retrospective comparison was performed of 24 ganciclovir-treated patients and 17 untreated patients with cytomegalovirus retinopathy. A masked assessment showed disease progression in 10 treated patients (43%) during a median period of 22 days. In contrast, 16 untreated patients (94%) had progression of disease during a median period of 25 days. Comparison of treated and untreated eyes also suggests that treatment may prevent deterioration of visual acuity during the same period. This study supports the conclusions of previous uncontrolled studies that ganciclovir is beneficial in the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and cytomegalovirus retinopathy. It also demonstrates the utility of the proposed system for assessment of disease outcome that can be used in future studies of therapy for necrotizing viral retinopathies.\r"

Apraclonidine was found to significantly decrease conjunctival oxygen tension 76% at 1 hour compared with baseline values. At 3 hours conjunctival oxygen tension was decreased to 56% and at 5 hours to 10% of baseline. Intraocular pressure was lowered maximally at 3 hours to 40% of baseline measurements in the treated eye. The contralateral eye had a small decrease in conjunctival oxygen tension and intraocular pressure that was not statistically significant.

  ".W": "Stress proteins have been highly conserved during evolution not only because of their fundamental importance in the response of the cell to stressful assaults, but also because they have critical roles in cellular activation and cell growth, regulation of protein function, protein transport, and protein assembly. Research focusing on the basic cell biology of stress proteins is intense at present, and will surely continue to be for some time to come. Of particular interest to immunologists and rheumatologists is the convergence of data in several fields that suggest that stress proteins in microorganisms that commonly infect humans may be triggers of humoral and cellular autoimmune responses and consequent overt autoimmune disease expression. Thus, stress proteins of M tuberculosis and other bacteria are close homologs of stress proteins in mammals, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats and, possibly, of RA and reactive arthritis in humans. A great deal of work remains to be done in this area, including (a) generation and propagation of specifically reactive T cell clones, (b) molecular delineation of the immune recognition elements and critical epitopes shared by microbial stress proteins and host proteins, (c) definition of the relative contribution of alpha beta and gamma delta TCRs to T cell reactivity to stress proteins, and (d) clarification of the circumstances that enable persistent T cell autoreactivity to stress proteins. The data at hand are sufficiently compelling, however, to suggest that vaccination against T cells that recognize stress proteins may eventually become part of our therapeutic armamentarium to prevent or cure some forms of arthritis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, granulocytes isolated from the blood of the same patients usually contain no immunoglobulin inclusions. Using the indirect granulocyte phagocytosis test (IGPT), we obtained evidence that this discrepancy can be explained by the finding that hyaluronic acid (HA), a component of synovial fluid, increases the avidity of rheumatoid factor (RF), resulting in the formation of IgG-IgM-RF complexes. The addition of HA to RA sera and subsequent testing by IGPT revealed an increased uptake of the induced immune complexes by these cells, which was dependent on the HA dose. Furthermore, supplementation of normal human serum with purified IgM-RF generated a positive IGPT result in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of HA. We conclude that HA, a component of synovial fluid, might facilitate immune complex formation in the joint cavity, resulting in the inflammatory reaction in the joints of RA patients.\r"

Physical health improved (P = 0.02), pain was reduced (P = 0.02), and psychological health improved marginally (P = 0.10) in patients contacted by phone compared with those not contacted by phone.

Since these capabilities are often needed to achieve conscious survival, emergency closed-chest cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) by veno-arterial pumping via oxygenator is presented in this review as a potential addition to ALS-PLS for selected cases. In six dog studies by the Pittsburgh group (n = 221; 1982 through 1988), all 179 dogs that received CPB after prolonged cardiac arrest (no flow) or after CPR (low flow) states had restoration of stable spontaneous circulation. The use of CPB enhanced survival and neurological recovery over those achieved with CPR-ALS attempts only. With CPB and standard intensive care, it was possible to reverse normothermic ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest (no flow) of up to 15 minutes and to achieve survival without neurologic deficit; VF of 20 minutes to achieve survival but with neurologic deficit; and VF of 30 minutes to achieve transient restoration of spontaneous circulation followed by secondary cardiac death. CPB could restore stable spontaneous circulation after ice water submersion of up to 90 minutes. Other groups' laboratory and clinical results agree with these findings in general. Clinical feasibility trials are needed to work out logistic problems and to meet clinical challenges. Future possibilities for emergency CPB require further research and development.\r"

The sympathoadrenal system and catecholamines have several potentially deleterious effects on large and small blood vessels and may promote thrombotic events. The hypothesis is put forward that norepinephrine is a major contributor to hypertensive vasculopathy and an overlooked cardiovascular risk factor. Choosing the optimal antihypertensive drugs may require considering the impact of the drugs on the sympathoadrenal system.\r"

As possible reasons for this relative failure were explored, new emphasis was placed on the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the vascular complications of hypertension. Most risk factors for coronary artery disease strongly involve the sympathetic nervous system, which may be the final common pathway for their adverse effects. The antihypertensive drugs used in most of the large clinical trials were associated with enhanced sympathetic activity. Moreover, excessive sodium depletion caused by large doses of diuretics and dietary low-sodium intake may have contributed to the treatment's ineffectiveness in preventing primary coronary disease. The implications of the research for antihypertensive treatment are discussed, with an emphasis on the physiologically appropriate role of clonidine therapy.\r"

Many of the metabolic effects are common to hypertension. Understanding the metabolic effects of the catecholamines could lead to understanding their role in disease states and thus to knowing the usefulness and risks of drugs that either mimic or block their action. The data presented were selected for their relevance to the metabolic abnormalities commonly encountered among hypertensive patients. The sympathetic nervous system's effects on glucose homeostasis, lipoprotein metabolism, potassium homeostasis, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension are discussed.\r"

How the sympathetic nervous system affects the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases is not fully understood, although new techniques for assessing plasma catecholamines and for quantitating sympathetic activity are adding to our knowledge.

  ".U": "90088905\r", 
  ".W": "Evidence for increased sympathetic drive, as assessed both by measurements of plasma norepinephrine and by studies of tritiated norepinephrine kinetics, is most frequently obtained in young hypertensive patients. During the initial phases of hypertension, the increased sympathetic drive may persistently elevate arterial pressure through effects on the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. In some patients, signs of a hyperkinetic circulation--including elevated heart rate and, less often, high cardiac output--predominate. In others, elevated vascular resistance, reflecting increased alpha-adrenergic tone, is the principal hemodynamic aberration. Even in patients with high cardiac output, a relative increase of vascular alpha-adrenergic tone accounts for their higher blood pressure. Increased sympathetic drive to the kidneys diminishes the efficiency of pressure diuresis, which is designed to restore normal arterial pressure. Although increased plasma norepinephrine levels are not consistently observed among older hypertensive patients compared with age-matched controls, neurogenic hypertension is not only a temporary event. In fact, tachycardia, which is neutrogenically mediated, doubles the risk of sustained hypertension later in life. The precise sequence of events in the transition from a principally neurogenic hypertension early in life to a predominantly nonneurogenic hypertension later in life is not known, although it likely includes decreased beta-receptor sensitivity with consequently reduced tachycardia and beta-mediated vasodilation. Functional diminution in endothelium-dependent vasodilation may augment sensitivity to vasoconstrictors such as norepinephrine and serotonin. Moreover, structural vascular changes nonspecifically enhance vascular reactivity to all vasoactive compounds and may provide a more permanent basis for altered pressure diuresis. Thus, hypertension initiated predominantly by neurogenic mechanisms could be sustained later without excessive sympathetic drive.\r"

  ".U": "90088906\r", 
  ".W": "A population of neurons localized to a small region of the brain stem reticular formation, the rostral ventrolateral reticular nucleus (RVL), is the principal area of the brainstem regulating resting, reflex, and probably behaviorally coupled control of arterial pressure. The critical area of the RVL reticular nucleus engaged in cardiovascular control surrounds a cluster of adrenergic neurons of the C1 group, and is therefore designated the C1 area. C1 area neurons have a direct and extremely potent synaptic relationship with preganglionic sympathetic neurons of the intermediolateral (IML) nucleus of the spinal cord. Neurons in the C1 area are tonically active and fire in relationship to the cardiac cycle, a rhythm imposed by baroreceptors. They thereby provide the background of excitation to preganglionic neurons to maintain normal resting arterial pressure. Which transmitter released by C1 area neurons produces sympathetic excitation is uncertain, but it may be glutamate. C1 area neurons are critical to the integration of a wide range of cardiovascular reflexes, including the arterial pressure responses to arterial baroreceptor, chemoreceptor, and other cardiopulmonary receptor stimulation, to pain and possibly to exercise, to brain stem ischemia and distortion, and probably to the arterial pressure elevations associated with emotional behavior. The cardiovascular neurons of the C1 area are responsive to the actions of a number of neurotransmitters, many of which are confined to local circuit neurons in the region, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), catecholamines, acetylcholine, and several opiates. They also appear to be the site of action upon arterial pressure of a number of drugs--including clonidine and possibly the beta-blockers. Neurons of the C1 area of the RVL reticular nucleus, therefore, appear to function as one of the most critical output systems of the brain for regulating arterial pressure in health and sickness.\r"

Mean dose of EPO was 103 U/kg for HF patients and 112.4 U/kg for patients on CD. At 9 months, no significant differences were observed in HCT (HF 33.6% vs. CD 33.2%), BUN, serum creatinine, potassium, or phosphorus. Hemoconcentration during dialysis was 12% for HF and 17% for CD. Urea clearance decreased 7% for HF and 9% for CD, while clearance of creatinine, potassium, and phosphorus decreased between 14 and 18% with both treatments. Heparin requirements increased 10% in HF and 16% in CD. Hypertension was similar in both groups. One HF patient withdrew from the study because of hypertension and one HF patient had seizures related to hypertension. Vascular access clotting or hospitalizations were no different. High flux dialysis patients on EPO over a 9 month period did not have any catastrophic complications when HCT was maintained between 30 and 35%.\r"

Most studies have been done on the liquid phase of the dialysate. In this study, a biofilm has been made in a hemodialysis system, using an additional pump that continuously supplies several bioproducts: gram (+) or gram (-) bacteria, or extracted endotoxin. The attachment of bacteria and the role of the biofilm in different circumstances were determined: 1) A contaminated dialysate with 1,000 bacteria/ml is necessary to set up a biofilm in the device. AAMI, Canadian, and French standards (200 bacteria/ml) are validated. 2) In the presence of non-endotoxic bacteria (Staphylococcus conhii, delta hemolytic), and when solutions contaminated by endotoxin are used, the biofilm produces micellar forms of endotoxin that are not removed by the filter. 3) The efficiency of disinfectants differs. For example, the activities of sodium hypochlorite, formaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide are lower in the biofilm than in static studies.\r"

After 15 minutes, the BC circulate was cultured, headers were unscrewed, and o-rings, header caps, and fiber bundle ends were cultured. For each germicide, bacteria were recovered in low numbers, primarily from the o-rings and the o-ring groove in the header caps. In 38 tests, a total of 60 of 342 assays (17.5%) were positive. In only one of these tests one bacterial colony forming unit (cfu) was recovered from the BC circulate during simulated dialysis. It was concluded that if header spaces and o-rings are contaminated, bacteria could be sealed protectively from the germicide. However, concentrations of surviving bacteria were low, probably outside the BC, and did not effectively contaminate the BC circulate during simulated dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "The clearance of urea and beta 2-microglobulin are important considerations along with biocompatibility in selecting membranes for use in shortened dialysis. During 3 hr of dialysis we have measured the in vivo urea clearances, pre- and post-beta 2-M levels, plasma clearance and simultaneous dialysance of beta 2-M. Leucopenia was compared after 15 min of dialysis on a cellulose acetate (CA) dialyzer and a polyacrylonitrile dialyzer (PAN). Clearance of urea was similar in both dialyzers. In contrast to CA, PAN removed beta 2-M and exhibited minimal leucopenia. The dialysance of beta 2-M was significantly less than the simultaneous blood side clearance. The disparity between blood clearance and dialysance by PAN membranes suggests removal of beta 2-M by adsorption and diffusion. We conclude that in comparison with CA dialyzers, PAN membranes remove beta 2-M, have equivalent urea clearances, and are more biocompatible.\r"

More recently, therapeutic trials of plasma or blood exchange are performed in septic patients for the purpose of reducing both endotoxins and albumin-bound toxins. As an alternate approach such as this for the removal of endotoxin directly from the blood, the authors recently developed polymyxin B immobilized fiber (PMX-F) as a biomaterial for selectively detoxifying endotoxin. That this newly invented PMX-F neutralizes a sufficient amount of endotoxin in vitro was reported previously. In ex vivo experiments, direct hemoperfusion by PMX-F was performed on purified endotoxin injected canine and on live Escherichia coli induced septic dogs. Only 5% (1/20) survived in the control group, but 75% (30/40) survived in the treated group. Septic dogs died within 18 hours after bacteria infusion in the control group. But all in the treated group survived 3 days. Forty percent of them survived permanently. These observations indicate that PMX-F treatment, namely selective removal of endotoxin in the endotoxic and septicaemic dogs prolongs or increases the chances of survival. Blood compatibility of PMX-F was also evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. With platelets it was shown to be fairly good and with red blood cells, white blood cells, and proteins, extremely good. A preclinical study on the efficacy and safety of PMX-F throughout widespread experiments has just ended.\r"

However, this procedure is compromised by antibody formation against WBCs and platelets. Accordingly, a miniature system for on-line plasma exchange (PE) between septic infant and healthy parent has been developed and evaluated using a canine model. Escherichia coli, at a dose of 5 X 10(9) CFU/ml/kg, was injected intravenously into 17 puppies that were divided into 3 groups; untreated; sham treated; and PE in which 80 ml/kg of plasma in each septic puppy was replaced during 2 hr with fresh plasma simultaneously obtained from healthy adult dogs. Four of 5 puppies survived in the PE group, while all other puppies died within 24 hr. In the PE group, viable cell counts of E. coli and endotoxin decreased significantly, and opsonic activity improved. This system is effective and applicable for treatment of sepsis in infants.\r"

Vascular grafts (6 mm ID, 7 cm in length) were fabricated with Biomer, coated on their luminal surfaces with test polymers, and implanted into the abdominal aorta of dogs. After 3 weeks-1 month, the grafts were retrieved and processed for TEM and SEM. TEM measured the thickness of adsorbed protein layers stained with a OsO4 solution, and the distribution pattern of adsorbed proteins (albumin, IgG and fibrinogen) using the immunoperoxidase technique. Retrieved grafts of Biomer and B-PEO-4K showed mural thrombi along the graft length, while thrombus formation on B-PEO-4K-HEP and H-S grafts was limited to the anastomotic sites. SEM pictures of B-PEO-4-HEP and H-S surfaces demonstrated clear morphology, with minimal platelet adhesion and activation, and microthrombi. Biomer and B-PEO-4K demonstrated a thick proteinaceous layer (1000-2000 A), whereas B-PEO-4K-HEP and H-S showed what can be described as a monolayer protein thickness (200-300 A). B-PEO-4K-HEP and H-S showed a monolayer-like adsorbed protein pattern, with high concentrations of albumin and IgG, and less fibrinogen, while Biomer and B-PEO-4K showed multilayered patterns with relatively high concentrations of fibrinogen, and less albumin. These results suggest that the surface properties of polymer may control protein adsorption pattern, and the composition of adsorbed protein is essential to in vivo long-term blood compatibility.\r"

Total pericardial substitutes fabricated from Silastic silicone rubber and Mitrathane polyetherurethane urea were implanted in greyhound dogs and harvested at 8 weeks. Pericardial adhesions were prevented by the substitutes that remained intact. Fibrous tissue formation had occurred on the epicardium underlying the substitutes, the extent being more severe in response to the Silastic compared with the Mitrathane. However, the Silastic was superior to the Mitrathane in retention of its tensile strength and elastic modulus over the implant period (p less than 0.05).

Assessment of possible variables that might influence the dosage response was also undertaken, both in a retrospective and prospective manner. Finally, a chart review of patients' symptoms while on dialysis was done to evaluate the effect of correction of anemia. Hematologic improvement was noted in all patients placed on hormone therapy with the correction of hemoglobin and hematocrit. There was no effect on white cell count, although a slight change in the differential was noted at target and one year; platelets rose to a new steady state. Dialysis efficiency was decreased slightly for urea and markedly for creatinine, probable reflecting the distribution characteristics of the latter. Retention of urate, phosphorus, and potassium was noted at target, with a drop toward usual serum levels with minimal dialysis prescription change. Variables such as age, gender, race, and dialysis prescription were compared in an effort to establish dosage variation, but no statistically significant changes were seen. There was an inverse trend in dosage, however, with increasing dialysis efficiency. Patients also seemed to be more tolerant of their dialysis treatments when nonanemic, compared to when anemic. While there is retention of some substances with improvement of anemia, the levels were easily corrected with adjustment of the dialysis prescription. No definite relationship could be seen in any of the variables studied and hormone dose requirements. Attention must be paid to adequate dialysis prescription in the erythropoietin treated patient.\r"

  ".W": "The eventual commonplace use of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPo) for the treatment of the anemia associated with chronic renal failure will have definite consequences in the dialysis supported patient. The effect of this nonanemic state on renal transplantation, both in the early posttransplant period as well as the waiting period, was examined in this study. Thirteen of 16 patients who were treated with the hormone and subsequently underwent cadaveric renal transplantation (Tx) were compared to control transplant patients from a typical chronic renal patient population. There seemed to be no difference in the length of hospital stay, need for dialysis support post-Tx, or severity of acute post-Tx renal failure as measured by the days of dialysis support given. Furthermore, there seemed to be no evidence of marrow unresponsiveness to endogenous erythropoietin produced by the functioning allograft, so that after an initial fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit, these parameters returned to normal levels at three to six months. HLA antibody production was also tracked over the course of chronic r-HuEPo therapy, and the response followed one of three patterns: (a) initially very high (100%) or very low (less than 15%) and showed no change; (b) moderate to high reactivity fell to lower levels with time; or (c) some stimulation noted without recent blood transfusions. Thus, patients entering end-stage renal failure without having been exposed to transfusions can be maintained in a low antibody state and perhaps increase the cadaveric kidneys available to them. Therefore, r-HuEPo therapy in patients who will subsequently undergo transplantation seems to have no deleterious effect on patient morbidity, or transplant outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "FUT, a new synthetic protease inhibitor, has been used recently in hemodialysis as an anticoagulant in patients with bleeding tendencies. As some new adsorbents require alternatives to heparin because of their strong adsorbing capacity for heparin, plasma perfusion with FUT anticoagulation was pharmacodynamically investigated. Blood was pumped from a dog (QB = 50-70 ml/min) into a plasma separator. The separated plasma (QP = 10-20 ml/min) passed through an adsorbent column and was reinfused into the blood that had passed through the plasma separator. FUT was continuously infused, at a flow rate of 50 mg/hr, into the blood as it left the dog and entered the extracorporeal circuit. Blood and plasma samples were taken as it exited the dog (S1), before and after the adsorbent column (S2, S3), and before reinfusion into the dog (S4). Except for that done with a charcoal-column, adsorbent plasma perfusion went well and the dog tolerated the procedure. FUT levels in S2, S3, and S4 provided anticoagulation. However, as the FUT levels in S1 remained negligible, the dog's coagulation time was within normal limits. In conclusion, FUT was pharmacodynamically proven to be a safe and reasonable anticoagulant for adsorbents that adsorb large amounts of heparin and for patients with bleeding tendencies.\r"

Retrieval analysis was performed on two calves (at 7 and 97 days) and a sheep (at 21 days). Six locations on each ventricle were systematically evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the thickness and distribution of proteins (albumin, IgG, and fibrinogen) on the surface. Gross thrombus was detected only on the left atrial cuff in the 97 day calf. SEM demonstrated fairly clear surface morphology, with minimal platelet adhesion and activation, and little thrombus formation. At 97 days, calcium deposits were detected along the diaphragm-housing junction. Protein layer thickness on the diaphragm increased with implant time; dominant proteins detected on the surface were fibrinogen and IgG, rather than albumin. Improvements in design and fabrication techniques have demonstrated decreased intradevice thrombosis with the U-100 TAH. However, systemic thromboembolism still remains a problem, and further improvements in the blood contacting surface of the U-100 TAH are necessary to achieve a thrombus free TAH.\r"

In this state, islets depend on diffusion of nutrients and wastes to and from the beta-cell to provide a suitable environment for survival and secretion. A perifusion system was constructed to test glucose-stimulated (100-300 mg/100 ml) insulin secretion from whole islets, or small (5-10 cell) aggregates, under controlled pO2. First phase insulin secretion from adult rat islets was unaffected by hypoxic levels of pO2, but second phase secretion was rapidly reduced at pO2 levels below 60 mmHg in the bulk media. Secretion from single-cell aggregates was unaffected until pO2 levels dropped to 12 mmHg, at which point secretion progressively decreased with falling pO2. A theoretical reaction/diffusion model was developed to correlate intraislet pO2 with reduced insulin secretion. Oxygen limited secretion was reversible, and not a result of decreased cell viability, as ascertained by both long-term static culture and trypan blue staining. Insulin secretion is more sensitive to hypoxia than is cell viability, in part because O2 uptake increases with glucose stimulation. These results indicate that O2 may be the limiting factor in the ability of immunoisolated islets to respond to blood glucose changes. We conclude that maintenance of a sufficiently high islet pO2 for maximal insulin secretion may be an important issue for graft design and implant site selection.\r"

Severity of itch and rash were assessed weekly by each patient on a visual analogue scale and overall clinical status monthly by a medical observer. Monitoring of patient ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure was undertaken throughout treatment by polysulphone film lapel-badge dosimetry. Five of 8 patients treated with azathioprine but none of 10 placebo patients achieved remission within 6 months. One patient could not tolerate treatment because of gastrointestinal effects. No haematological or hepatic abnormality was noted. The marked improvement in clinical status of actively treated patients (P less than 0.02, Fisher's exact test), led to early termination of the trial.

During the first 10 months patients were classified on admission according to the perceived need for operation, with laparoscopy being performed on all those in whom the need for operation was uncertain. In addition, all women with suspected appendicitis underwent laparoscopy because previous studies by us and others have demonstrated a high error rate in this group. During the second 11 months of the study a similar system of classification and procedure was used but the patient's initial assessment was entered on a structured data sheet. After the patient had been discharged home this information was entered into a computer-aided diagnosis program. Hypothetical retrospective computer-aided decisions were then made about patient management. The final management error rate (correct decision to operate or not) was compared with the actual error rate using the clinical system. The final overall error rate in the first 10 months was 11 out of 163 patients and this was improved to 3 out of 158 in the second 11 months of the study by the addition of the structured data sheet to selective laparoscopy. A management policy based entirely on diagnostic probabilities taken from the computer-aided diagnosis program would have produced an error rate of 26 out of 158. We conclude that in the management of the acute abdomen a policy based on clinical decision combined with selective laparoscopy may be superior to one based on diagnostic probabilities alone. Further improvement in results follows the introduction of a structured data sheet for initial data collection.\r"

  ".W": "We have evaluated the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of laparoscopy under general anaesthesia, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) in detecting intra-abdominal metastases in 90 consecutive patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or cardia. Metastases were histologically confirmed as hepatic in 25 patients, nodal in 35 and peritoneal in nine. All investigations had high specificity (86-100 per cent) for each type of metastasis. Laparoscopy was found to be significantly more sensitive (P less than 0.01; P less than 0.02) and more accurate (P less than 0.01; P less than 0.01) than either ultrasound or CT, respectively, with regard to hepatic status. Although laparoscopy performed best with regard to nodal metastases, this reached statistical significance only when sensitivity of ultrasound was compared (P less than 0.01). Neither ultrasound nor CT detected any peritoneal metastases, although laparoscopy detected eight out of nine, giving a sensitivity of 89 per cent and an accuracy of 98 per cent. There was no morbidity or mortality associated with laparoscopy, which offers a safe, reliable method of determining intra-abdominal status and may obviate the need for surgery in some patients with malignant dysphagia.\r"

No screening tools have been developed which allow this disease to be surgically treated for cure at an early stage. None of the forms of adjuvant chemotherapy instituted in the months and years after surgical resection of cancer have been successful. We show that resection site recurrence and spread of disease on the peritoneal surfaces are the most common sites for surgical treatment failure. By changing the route of administration and the timing of chemotherapy, the efficacy of drugs now routinely employed in gastrointestinal cancer can be markedly improved. Our early studies suggest that there is a definite change in the natural history of these malignancies when intraperitoneal chemotherapy is administered immediately after surgery. The pharmacology and physiology of drug delivery in the immediate postoperative period are explored. Toxicity studies have been performed in a series of treatment protocols already in use. These protocols need to be subjected to randomized controlled trials in the near future.\r"

The mesocolon or mesorectum was dissected initially by the traditional method and all the lymph nodes identified were examined histologically. After fat clearance the specimen was dissected again and further lymph nodes were examined. Forty-one specimens were obtained from the rectum and 62 from the colon. Traditional dissection produced a mean of 6.2 lymph nodes per specimen, but following fat clearance a further mean of 12.4 nodes per specimen were found. The total number of lymph nodes recovered varied from two to 69 with a mean of 18.5 per specimen. Traditional dissection showed 45 specimens (43.7 per cent) to have lymph node metastases but after fat clearance a further five specimens (4.8 per cent) were found to be lymph node positive. Therefore, of the 58 specimens graded initially as Dukes' B, five (8.6 per cent) were shown after fat clearance to be Dukes' C tumours. In the Dukes' C cases the mean (s.d.) number of involved lymph nodes per specimen was 2.7 (2.1) by traditional dissection and 4.2 (3.9) after fat clearance. Forty-seven (94.0 per cent) of the Dukes' C tumours were correctly identified after examination of specimens containing up to 13 lymph nodes. Fat clearance of the mesocolon or mesorectum should be used when traditional dissection has failed to identify at least 13 nodes and the tumour has been classified as Dukes' B.\r"

DNA aneuploidy was detected in 60 patients (62 per cent) in the surgery only group, but in only 33 patients (37 per cent) after radiotherapy (P less than 0.01). There was a significant reduction in local recurrence in irradiated patients (P less than 0.0001). DNA diploid tumours were less likely to recur locally. This was more marked in the radiotherapy group (P = 0.01) than in the surgery only group (P = 0.06). After radiotherapy, only the surgeons' assessments of a 'curative' resection and DNA ploidy were independent predictors of local recurrence in multivariate regression analysis, whilst Dukes' classification was not. In conclusion, DNA ploidy may indicate response to radiotherapy and is an important predictor of subsequent local tumour progression.\r"

Several arteriographic scoring systems have been devised in an attempt to quantify the run-off. More recently Pulse Generated Run-off and intraoperative peripheral resistance measurements have been proposed as better predictors of early graft patency. Eighty-eight consecutive femorodistal bypass grafts were studied using Pulse Generated Run-off (PGR), conventional and intra-arterial digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) and peripheral resistance measurement. Three widely used arteriographic scoring systems were used to grade the arteriographic run-off. There were significant correlations between the scoring systems and the measured peripheral resistance, although PGR correlated better with peripheral resistance than arteriography (rs = -0.59, P less than 0.001). Intra-arterial DSA improved the correlation between the arteriogram scoring systems and the measured peripheral resistance in the distal popliteal artery, but not in single calf vessels. In contrast, PGR correlated much better with peripheral resistance in single calf vessels (rs = -0.82, P less than 0.001). We recommend that selection for femorodistal reconstruction be based on a combination of intra-arterial DSA and PGR. PGR will identify patent distal calf vessels not seen on arteriography and determine their continuity with the pedal arch, two features which are essential prerequisites for successful femorodistal bypass.\r"

Insufficient training of medical personnel and hence lack of expertise in the management of injured children are factors contributing to disability and death in such children. Although the principles of resuscitation of injured children are similar to those for adults, appreciation of the differences in cardiorespiratory variables, airway anatomy, response to blood loss, thermoregulation and equipment required is essential for successful initial resuscitation. Cerebral, abdominal and thoracic injuries account for most of the disability and death among injured children. Cerebral damage may be due to secondary injuries to the brain and is potentially preventable. The need to preserve the spleen in children complicates the management of abdominal trauma. Although children usually have large cardiorespiratory reserves, they are likely to need airway control and ventilation with thoracic injuries. The psychologic effect of trauma may pose long-term problems and needs close follow-up.\r"

These neoplasms were cytokeratin-positive and vimentin-positive and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-negative. Ten patients with neoplasms of low cellularity and no mitoses have not had tumor recurrences, whereas four patients with more cellular and mitotically active tumors have experienced either recurrences or death. We recommend simple surgical excision, without additional chemotherapy, for the hypocellular, mitotically inactive cases. The transition from mitotically active spindle cell tumors to frankly sarcomatous areas in three cases indicates that these lesions may be the substratum for the development of sarcomas in some patients with germ cell tumors. Based on their histologic appearance and immunohistochemical profile, as well as preceding evidence of yolk sac tumor (YST) in 11 patients (data incomplete in 3 cases), we speculate that many of these cases represent overgrowth of a spindle cell component of YST that is selected for by chemotherapy.\r"

The histogenetic theories regarding this tumor include that it is a teratoma, or that the myogenic component arises from the perivascular or leptomeningeal ectomesenchyme, or pluripotential neuroectodermal cells, or endothelial cells. The authors' findings do not elucidate the histogenesis but argue against an endothelial origin of the rhabdomyoblastic component.\r"

The TCV regimen was significantly more effective than TV, considering all evaluable episodes, documented infections, gram-negative infections, and infections in patients with persistent severe neutropenia (less than 100 neutrophils/mm3). The results with CV were intermediate between TV and TCV. The toxicities were similar with all three regimens and consisted primarily of skin rashes. The TCV regimen is effective for empiric therapy of fever in neutropenic patients and probably should be utilized in preference to CV or TV, although its superiority over CV in this study was inconclusive.\r"

Once the proper diagnosis is made, the pathophysiology of throwing injuries has to be understood by the physician, the trainer, and the athlete, and then the actual treatment begins in phase III. Initial treatment many times consists of a short period of relative rest as well as physical therapy modalities to relieve pain, and once pain is relieved phase IV begins, which is the actual techniques of range of motion, flexibility, and strengthening maneuvers. Once adequate flexibility, range of motion, and pain-free motion have been achieved, as well as adequate endurance strength, proper warm-up techniques are begun, and then a return to throwing is achieved in phase VI. The total rehabilitative cycle is concluded with phase VII, which consists of an off-season conditioning program to verify that the athlete will maintain year-round maximum condition of not only the throwing shoulder but of the entire athlete.\r"

The study consisted of a 4-6 week single-blind, placebo-controlled run-in phase, during which the stabilization of the initial claudication distance of all patients was assessed before randomization to a 6-month double-blind observation period. The diagnosis of COAD was established by clinical findings, conventional angiography, and noninvasive peripheral Doppler pressure assessment at rest and after exercise. The results of the overall intention-to-treat analysis of the study population show statistically significant superiority of pentoxifylline over placebo for all absolute claudication distance summary and end point measures. By using two clinically relevant parameters, which are a resting ankle/arm pressure ratio 0.8 or less and a duration of COAD for greater than 1 year, a target population could be defined in whom trial results became highly significant. For nontarget patients with mild COAD, we conclude that basic therapeutic measures should include the treatment of risk factors and the initiation of physical training. For target patients, however, a multifactorial therapeutic approach, including the use of pentoxifylline, is justified.\r"

Endomyocardial biopsy revealed moderate (41 patients) or severe (three patients) rejection in 44 patients. Severe infections of bacterial septicemia (11 patients), bronchopneumonia (two patients), and viral infection (seven patients) were detected by a meticulous schedule of various clinical and laboratory tests. beta 2-Microglobulin levels in serum, generally corrected for serum creatinine, were significantly elevated in patients with infections (median, 6.3 mg/l; range Q10-Q90, 3.47-10.27 mg/l) compared with levels in patients with rejection (p less than 0.0001) or in patients in obviously good condition (p less than 0.0001). At the onset of acute rejection, the median corrected beta 2-microglobulin serum level was 1.56 mg/l (range Q10-Q90, -0.05-3.46 mg/l) and was significantly different from the control group (p less than 0.01). In addition, density function and empirical quantile analyses allowed us to define ranges of beta 2-microglobulin levels that would differentiate between rejection (2.05-3.46 mg/l) and infection (greater than 3.46 mg/l). With these values, sensitivity and specificity were 0.9 and 0.938 for detection of infection and 0.23 and 0.925 for detection of rejection, respectively. By means of beta 2-microglobulin, two cases of infection were misinterpreted as rejection (10%), and four of 44 rejections were mistaken for infections (9%). We conclude that measurements of beta 2-microglobulin may improve the management of heart transplant patients.\r"

Venous stenosis near the anastomosis was the reason for failure in 45% of PTFE grafts compared with 16% of B-C fistulas (p less than 0.001). Failure occurred, on average, 16 months after PTFE graft placement compared with 22 for B-C fistulas (p = NS). Proximal vein segments removed from five failed and two functioning PTFE graft communications were studied using light and electron microscopy and immunocytochemical techniques. All venous segments removed during surgical shunt repair exhibited a marked intimal hyperplasia. The intimal cellular component was almost exclusively smooth muscle. Accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets was not seen. Foam cells as well as extracellular lipid deposits were absent; macrophages and lymphocytes were absent from the zone of proliferation. Ultrastructural examination revealed a large proportion of extracellular matrix surrounding smooth muscle cells in the neointima. Collagen and elastin were present in the extracellular matrix, in greatest concentration deeper in the intima. Closer to the lumen, most of the extracellular volume consisted of proteoglycan. Hemosiderin was absent from the lesions as were consistent signs of luminal and intimal fibrin. Uniform intimal gradients of actin, collagen, and proteoglycan suggest that this is a steadily progressive, rather than episodic, proliferative response. These clinical and histologic observations and an analysis of hemodynamic stresses support the postulate that upstream release of platelet-derived growth factor, and possibly, shear-induced intimal injury stimulate this response. This myointimal proliferative process provides a readily accessible model of fibromuscular hyperplasia in humans; its understanding may lead to effective methods for its prevention and may provide clues to the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "The degree of exercise-induced cardiac dysfunction and its relation to the anaerobic threshold were evaluated in 23 patients with chronic heart disease. A symptom-limited exercise test was performed with a cycle ergometer with work rate increased by 1 W every 6 seconds. Left ventricular function, as reflected by ejection fraction, was continuously monitored with a computerized cadmium telluride detector after the intravenous injection of technetium-labeled red blood cells. The anaerobic threshold (mean, 727 +/- 166 ml/min) was determined by the noninvasive measurement of respiratory gas exchange. As work rate rose, the left ventricular ejection fraction increased but reached a peak value at the anaerobic threshold and then fell below resting levels. Ejection fraction at rest, anaerobic threshold, and peak exercise were 41.4 +/- 11.3%, 46.5 +/- 12.0%, and 37.2 +/- 11.0%, respectively. Stroke volume also increased from rest (54.6 +/- 17.0 ml/beat) to the point of the anaerobic threshold (65.0 +/- 21.2 ml/beat) and then decreased at peak exercise (52.4 +/- 18.7 ml/beat). The slope of the plot of cardiac output versus work rate decreased above the anaerobic threshold. The anaerobic threshold occurred at the work rate above which left ventricular function decreased during exercise. Accurate determination of the anaerobic threshold provides an objective, noninvasive measure of the oxygen uptake above which exercise-induced deterioration in left ventricular function occurs in patients with chronic heart disease.\r"

The calcium entry blockers have assumed a greater role than first thought possible in the management of cardiovascular disorders. As a group, they have multiple effects and can be tailored to meet specific needs. The drugs are well tolerated, thus making them useful for chronic administration. The efficacy of the calcium entry blockers can be enhanced when combined with other therapies such as beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme as applied to patients with hypertension, angina pectoris, or both. The range of indications and potential uses of the calcium entry blockers demands an understanding of the role of the slow inward current in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. This review focuses on the pharmacological actions of the calcium entry blockers and relates these events to their clinical applications in an effort to achieve an understanding of their multiple therapeutic uses.\r"

Indexes of left ventricular function included pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray, acute anterolateral Q wave myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram, and radionuclide ejection fraction. Pulmonary congestion and acute anterolateral infarction had significant (p less than 0.01) interactions with treatment allocation, and the third variable, ejection fraction, showed a similar trend (p less than 0.1). There was a diltiazem-related reduction in cardiac death (Cox hazard ratio, 0.76-0.86) for each of the parameters reflecting good ventricular function, and a significant diltiazem-related increase in cardiac death (Cox hazard ratio, 1.52-1.85) for each of the parameters associated with impaired function. Three-factor interactions highlighted the extremes of the favorable and adverse effects of diltiazem in subsets with unimpaired and impaired left ventricular function. These findings permit more appropriate selection of patients for the safe and effective administration of diltiazem to postinfarction patients.\r"

Due to their anti-ischemic and spasmolytic properties, the cardioprotective effects of these agents have been studied in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. This paper will review this application with respect to limitation of infarct size, reduction of mortality, and incident morbidity rates. Of the agents currently available for clinical use, nifedipine has been studied most extensively. This agent shows no beneficial effects and its use can, in fact, be harmful in this setting. Of the few trials that have been conducted with verapamil, none have shown a preventive effect on death, reinfarction, or postinfarction angina. Both verapamil and diltiazem might limit infarct size although further confirmation is required. At the present time, diltiazem is the only agent shown to have short- and long-term benefits on clinical outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The success of prophylactic diltiazem is, however, critically dependent on proper patient selection. In particular, those patients with non-Q wave infarction, normal left ventricular function, or both can be expected to derive the greatest benefit in terms of reduced mortality and incident morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension is now commonly undertaken. Clinical trials have shown a marked decrease in strokes in treated hypertensive patients. But despite reports of decreases in coronary deaths in some trials, the overall incidence of coronary events has been largely unaffected. This disappointing outcome has raised interesting issues. The patients in comparative placebo groups often do better than expected in formal trials; apart from the benefits of lifestyle changes, many of these patients appear to normalize their blood pressures during the trial. This latter effect can be due to erroneous diagnoses of hypertension at the start of the study, and this partially dilutes the likelihood of differences in outcome between the placebo- and actively treated patients. Optimal control of blood pressure is difficult to define, and controversies exist concerning whether pressures have been decreased insufficiently or excessively in clinical trials; it has been argued, too, that systolic as well as diastolic hypertension should be the target of treatment. Inadvertent treatment-induced metabolic abnormalities, especially in blood lipids, glucose, and electrolytes can weaken the antihypertensive benefits. Failure to deal with concurrent risk factors including smoking and left ventricular hypertrophy also could explain the absence of a decrease in coronary events. Newer classes of antihypertensive agents offer the potential to address these concerns and improve the cardiovascular prognosis of treated hypertensive patients.\r"

Of the many pathophysiological factors and markers for the factors that can be considered as possible elements of a profiling algorithm, there are relatively few with solid data to support their use. Use of plasma renin activity for prospective profiling does not appear to be valid for individual patients. It remains useful for diagnosis of renal artery stenosis and primary aldosteronism. The black race does have some well-documented pathophysiological differences from the white race regarding hypertension, and there are some useful data bits for selecting specific therapy. The elderly, obese patients, and young patients with hyperdynamic circulation appear to have enough group characteristics to enable selection of drugs more targeted to their needs. Anxious patients who often display symptoms that mimic pheochromocytoma symptoms comprise a unique group. One of the largest groups is patients with hypertension plus one or more concomitant diseases. Finally, drug selection decisions must also consider the effect of drugs on serum lipoproteins, left ventricular hypertrophy and vascular compliance, sexual function and other quality of life issues, and cost.\r"

LVH cannot be considered, however, an adaptive process only serving to normalize wall stress but can be considered one that significantly increases the risk of sudden death, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases. Patients with LVH exhibit impaired ventricular filling, ventricular arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia even in the absence of coronary artery disease. LVH can be prevented or reversed by a variety of antihypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Calcium channel blockers, more than angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, suppress ectopic impulse generation, improve ventricular compliance, and alleviate myocardial ischemia while preserving or improving the contractile state. In contrast, ACE inhibitors can be particularly useful in patients with LVH and diminished ventricular contractility and in preventing chamber dilatation after myocardial infarct. These favorable cardiovascular effects of both calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors are a reason for optimism that carefully tailored therapy will ultimately diminish the well-documented risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with LVH.\r"

LVH induced by hypertension is associated with reduced myocardial compliance, structural alterations, and changes in coronary perfusion. Calcium entry blockers have caused LVH regression both in experimental studies and in clinical trials. Although their efficacy as antihypertensive agents is primarily due to their vasodilating properties, the mechanisms by which calcium entry blockers accomplish LVH regression are complex and include various hemodynamic and neurohumoral factors. Calcium entry blockade has decreased LVH with no apparent deterioration of left ventricular function. Because LVH is a major risk factor for sudden cardiac death and other cardiac morbidities, it is possible that the regression of LVH can improve the prognosis in hypertensive patients.\r"

The growing availability of potent and effective cardiovascular drugs, together with the high prevalence of untoward side effects in the elderly, make it important that we consider the influence of age on cardiovascular response to the calcium entry blockers. The age-related structural, functional, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic changes that occur in elderly patients suggest that careful monitoring, adjustment, and frequent reassessment of the medical regimen should be performed to minimize untoward effects. Nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil are all well absorbed orally, are extensively protein bound, and are metabolized by the liver. The age-associated attenuation in rates of hepatic metabolism and hepatic blood flow contribute to the decreased clearance and prolonged elimination half-lives of these drugs in the elderly. Advanced age can be associated with increased susceptibility to sinoatrial depression, fatigue, constipation, hypotension, and peripheral edema after calcium entry blockade, even at modest doses. It would be prudent, therefore, to administer these agents at lower doses and at less frequent intervals.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac arrhythmias are generated as the result of disorders of automaticity or impulse conduction. Regardless of the mechanism, however, calcium is likely to be involved. The rate of Ca2+ flux across the membrane of automatic cells alters their firing rate. Myocardial cells that do not ordinarily initiate action potentials can do so when they are partially depolarized. Low extracellular Ca2+ concentrations or Ca2+ channel-blocking drugs can reduce or abolish such ectopic firing. Early afterdepolarizations are also induced in cardiac cells by partial depolarization, whereas delayed afterdepolarizations are induced by Ca2+ overloading. Early afterdepolarizations and delayed afterdepolarizations can both be suppressed by low external Ca2+ concentrations or by Ca2+ channel blockers. With respect to arrhythmias ascribable to disorders of conduction, Ca2+ channel blockers can aggravate conduction disturbances in the sinoatrial node or atrioventricular junction. Furthermore, these drugs can abolish those reentrant arrhythmias in which a cardiac impulse rotates around a loop in which nodal tissue is an integral element. Ca2+ channel blockers can also reduce the susceptibility for ventricular fibrillation to supervene in ischemic hearts, especially when the sympathetic nervous system is overactive.\r"

Consequently, in cardiac arrhythmias where the AV node is part of the reentry circuit, a beneficial effect of diltiazem and verapamil can be demonstrated. These include AV nodal reentry and orthodromic tachycardia in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In addition, the ventricular response by the AV node during atrial tachycardias can also be controlled with these agents. A specific type of ventricular tachycardia seen in the absence of structural heart disease has also been reported to respond to intravenous and oral verapamil. Calcium channel blockers have no proven depressant effect on accessory pathway conduction. Similarly, the value of these agents in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in association with chronic coronary artery disease and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is rather limited. The use of calcium entry blockers in patients with wide QRS tachycardia, therefore, is to be discouraged unless it can be proved that supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction is the underlying basis.\r"

Although these agents cause little vasodilation of the epicardial coronary arteries during basal conditions, they block vasoconstriction that can increase stenosis severity during isometric exercise and interrupt coronary artery spasm in patients with variant angina. Administration of the calcium blockers causes transient vasodilation of the coronary resistance vessels, followed by decreased responsiveness to a brief ischemic stimulus. This results in decreased coronary reactive hyperemia after transient coronary occlusion. By preventing excessive ischemic vasodilation of the resistance vessels, these agents can enhance perfusion of the subendocardium distal to a flow-limiting coronary stenosis. The calcium entry blockers have relatively little effect on the immature coronary collateral vessels that exist at the time of acute coronary occlusion. Diltiazem, however, has been demonstrated to increase collateral blood flow in animals in which chronic coronary occlusion has resulted in growth of moderately well-developed collateral vessels.\r"

Recent studies of various experimental renal disorders have shown that normalization of glomerular capillary flow and pressure, either by restricting protein intake or by administering converting enzyme inhibitors, slows this progression. Because the hemodynamic actions of Ca2+ channel blockers modify the angiotensin II-induced renal changes, these drugs have the potential for altering the course of renal disorders. These agents also protect the kidney from ischemic injury and nephrocalcinosis and reduce platelet aggregation, which can further contribute to the preservation of renal function. The published studies regarding the role of Ca2+ channel blockers in chronic renal disease, however, do not allow drawing firm conclusions. The effect of these agents might depend on the nature of renal disease and the drug and dose used. Controlled trials are needed before these drugs can be recommended for preservation of renal function.\r"

  ".W": "Although the vasodilator and anti-ischemic actions of calcium channel blocking drugs might be expected to produce hemodynamic benefits in chronic heart failure, none of these agents has been shown to exert favorable clinical effects in these patients. Furthermore, when left ventricular function is markedly impaired, short- and long-term therapy with calcium channel blockers can increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Previous investigators have attributed these unfavorable results to the established negative inotropic effects of calcium channel blockers on the failing heart. Yet, this cardiodepressant action seems to account for only the deleterious responses seen during short-term therapy with these drugs, whereas the detrimental effects of long-term treatment can be more readily explained by the capacity of calcium channel blockers to activate endogenous neurohormonal systems, especially the renin-angiotensin system. According to this hypothesis, a number of cardioactive drugs (including calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and converting enzyme inhibitors) can depress myocardial contractility, but only calcium channel blockers, which activate neurohormonal systems, adversely affect patients with left ventricular dysfunction, whereas beta-blockers and converting enzyme inhibitors, which interfere with neurohormonal activity, can favorably modify the long-term outcome of these high-risk patients. If confirmed by future studies, these observations suggest that the effect of antianginal drugs on neurohormonal systems, as well as on cardiac contractility, should be an important consideration in the selection of a therapeutic agent in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure.\r"

In patients with known coronary artery disease, positive treadmill tests are unaccompanied by pain about 34% of the time. In patients with stable angina pectoris, silent ischemia comprises about 70% of total ischemic events. This frequency approaches 80% in patients with unstable angina. About 20-30% of all myocardial infarctions are silent. Of patients who survive myocardial infarction, about 5% have silent ischemia on early treadmill testing, which signals an adverse prognosis. Overall, the presence of ischemia increases the risk for any subset of patients with coronary disease. Furthermore, the risk is the same whether the ischemia is silent or symptomatic. In summary, silent ischemia is common in patients with coronary disease and adversely affects prognosis, especially in high-risk patients.\r"

Although changes in coronary vasomotor tone probably are important in the genesis of asymptomatic ischemia, heart rate increases also play a critical role. Consequently, all three classes of antianginal agents, nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium entry blockers, have been shown efficacious as monotherapy for silent ischemia. Comparative studies have demonstrated that agents or combination therapies that control heart rate increases during normal activities are superior to regimens that increase average heart rate. Consideration of the side-effect profile of any therapy for asymptomatic patients also is important. The ideal therapy would be with one drug that reduced coronary vasomotor tone and myocardial oxygen demand during normal activities and had no adverse effects. Currently, the calcium entry blockers, diltiazem and verapamil, most closely approximate this ideal. It has yet to be proven, however, that the treatment of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia improves the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease, and the risk-benefit ratio of pharmacological therapy is not established.\r"

Thus, it is not surprising that these drugs are effective in treating unstable angina that is often characterized by increased vasomotion and dynamic obstruction at the site of atheromatous plaques. Nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil are all highly and equally effective in reducing painful and painless ischemic episodes in Prinzmetal's variant angina. In patients with unstable angina who have known or suspected significant underlying coronary artery disease, a multipharmacological approach to therapy is warranted. Nifedipine used with beta-blocker drugs is more effective than nifedipine as monotherapy. Diltiazem and verapamil have been shown to be effective when given without beta-blockers in unstable angina patients. In many patients, thrombus formation rather than vasospasm is the major pathophysiological event resulting in progression of the syndrome to infarction or sudden death. In these patients, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, or antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy is of utmost importance to maintain adequate coronary flow. Nonresponders to medical therapy with unstable angina have a high prevalence of eccentric and multiple coronary stenoses with a high incidence of thrombi. The best responders to calcium antagonist therapy are patients with concentric coronary stenoses. In summary, calcium antagonists are highly effective in reducing ischemic episodes in patients with Prinzmetal's angina and effective for therapy for unstable angina when used in conjunction with other forms of medical treatment aimed at the processes of platelet activation and thrombus formation.\r"

TGF-beta stimulates matrix protein synthesis, has dramatic effects on the bone cells responsible for bone formation and resorption, and is abundant in bone and bone-conditioned media. Multiple sources of TGF-beta have been described. It was initially purified from platelets. Two distinct forms of TGF-beta have been purified from bone. The second form, TGF-beta II, was initially purified from bone but was then identified in platelets and also as the major TGF-beta in the monkey kidney BSC-1 cell line. The two bone-derived factors were called cartilage-inducing Factor A (CIF-A) and cartilage-inducing Factor B (CIF-B), based on their capacity to induce the formation of extracellular matrix proteins, which are characteristic of cartilage. CIF-A is identical to the TGF-beta purified from platelets, which is called TGF-beta I. CIG-B is the same as TGF-beta II, which was sequenced soon after CIF-B was discovered and characterized. There is 70% sequence homology between the two forms. The largest source of TGF-beta in the body is present in bone (200 micrograms/kg tissue), although the most concentrated source is in platelets. TGF-beta has multiple effects on bone cells depending on their phenotype and/or stage of differentiation. Osteoblasts, the cells responsible for formation of new bone and perhaps cellular control of bone remodeling, are directly affected by TGF-beta, which can induce differentiation or proliferation, depending on the osteoblastic cell type examined. TGF-beta inhibits the formation of osteoclast precursors and bone resorption and, in greater concentrations, has inhibitory effects on isolated osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. TGF-beta may act as a bone-coupling factor linking bone resorption to bone formation.\r"

  ".W": "While there are new techniques for lengthening long bones, there are, nevertheless, contraindications and preoperative considerations for lengthening the femur or tibia, such as the presence of acetabular dysplasia, fixed deformity around joints, peripheral vascular and metabolic bone disease, and the age of the patient. Lengthening a long bone may be associated with many complications, especially in a congenitally short bone. It is important to anticipate and prevent complications, especially nonunion, subluxation of joints, muscle contractures, and neurologic complications. Lengthening of the femur and tibia are not for the occasional operator. However, as Bosworth noted in 1938, attention to great detail when lengthening the bone and skilled and detailed postoperative care will allow excellent results to be obtained. Time alone will tell what, biologically, is the best method for lengthening a long bone.\r"

  ".W": "The cytoplasmic components of chondrocytes in the various zones of articular cartilage of the medial femoral condyle of six-week-old male New Zealand white rabbits stored in tissue culture medium at 37 degrees in 5% CO2 and air were quantitated from electron micrographs, and the results were compared statistically with the cytoplasmic components of chondrocytes in the corresponding zones of in vivo articular cartilage. The major changes that occurred during storage were: (1) an increase in the amount of lipid bodies in chondrocytes in the tangential, transitional, and calcified zones; (2) a decrease in the number of holes in the cytoplasm of chondrocytes in the radial and calcified zones; (3) a decrease in the amount of endoplasmic reticulum in the radial and calcified zones; and (4) an increase in cell size and cytosol area in the tangential and transitional zones but a significant decrease in cell size and cytosol area in the calcified zone. Stored articular cartilage chondrocytes demonstrated cellular changes associated with aging, whereas in vivo articular cartilage chondrocytes demonstrated changes associated with degeneration. The matrix of stored articular cartilage in the tangential, transitional, and upper part of the radial zones showed a decrease in opacity due to a decrease in the number of collagen fibers per unit area of matrix, a condition termed \"chondroporosis.\" This study demonstrates that articular cartilage stored in standard tissue culture medium under ideal physiological conditions is morphologically abnormal. Based on these findings, one would not expect such stored cartilage to remain functionally intact when transplanted to replace articular cartilage loss.\r"

Symptoms often reverse spontaneously after six to nine months. Recurrence of symptoms in an adjacent joint is a distinguishing feature. Routine laboratory tests are uninformative. Diagnosis is made after exclusion of more common entities. Knowledge of RMO can prevent unnecessary invasive procedures. Vertebral osteoporosis has recently been associated with RMO. A 50-year-old physician developed the symptoms and signs of RMO superimposed upon well-documented idiopathic vertebral osteoporosis. This association should be recognized when evaluating lower limb pain.\r"

  ".W": "For 40 years, the author has been developing a system of orthopedics, traumatology, and limb lengthening using a circular transfixion-wire external skeletal fixator, often in combination with biomechanic methods of stimulating the formation of new osseous tissue within a widening osteotomy distraction site. The factors important for neoosteogenesis after osteotomy include: maximum preservation of extraosseous and medullary blood supply; stable external fixation; a delay prior to distraction; a distraction rate of 1 mm per day in frequent small steps; a period of stable neutral fixation after lengthening; and physiologic use of the elongating limb. For a successful fixator application, the apparatus must be applied with consideration given to the number, size, and location of the rings, the placement and tension on the wires, the technique of wire insertion, the effect of soft-tissue transfixion on limb use, and the prevention of bone and joint deformities caused by countertension in soft tissues. Clinical application of the author's techniques permits stature increase in certain forms of dwarfism, correction of deformities and limb-length inequalities, and stump elongation. For many of these applications, motorized distraction can provide continuous limb lengthening while the apparatus is on the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Difficulties that occur during limb lengthening were subclassified into problems, obstacles, and complications. Problems represented difficulties that required no operative intervention to resolve, while obstacles represented difficulties that required an operative intervention. All intraoperative injuries were considered true complications, and all problems during limb lengthening that were not resolved before the end of treatment were considered true complications. The difficulties that occurred during limb lengthening include muscle contractures, joint luxation, axial deviation, neurologic injury, vascular injury, premature consolidation, delayed consolidation, nonunion, pin site problems, and hardware failure. Late complications are those of loss of length, late bowing, and refracture. Joint stiffness may also be a permanent residual complication. Pain and difficulty sleeping are other problems that arise during limb lengthening, especially in the more extensive cases. Forty-six patients had 60 limb segments lengthened between 1.0 and 16.0 cm, with a mean of 5.6 cm. The average treatment time was approximately one month per centimeter for single-level lengthenings with no deformity and 1.2 months per centimeter with deformity correction. The lengthening index for double-level lengthening was 0.57 month per centimeter with no deformity and 0.90 month per centimeter with correction of deformity. In adults, the lengthening index was 1.7 months per centimeter for single-level and 1.1 months per centimeter for double-level lengthening. There were 35 problems that had to be resolved in the outpatient clinic. There were 11 obstacles that required additional operative intervention to resolve. There were 27 true complications, of which 17 were considered minor and ten were considered major complications. Of the major complications, three interfered with achieving the original goals of treatment. All three required further operative intervention to achieve the original goal. These were nonunion in one and late bowing in two. Despite these problems, obstacles, and complications, the original goals of surgery were achieved in 57 of the 60 limb segments treated. Patient satisfaction was achieved in 94% of 46 cases.\r"

Ninety-six percent (341) of the subjects completed the 30-item screening questionnaire. Eighty-nine percent of the 341 responders wrote in their names in the space provided for that purpose. Fifty-two patients (approximately 15%) of the 341 responded \"yes\" to six or more items in the current study. Based on a previous study comparing scores from 200 adolescents from the same pediatric practice with answers from 100 identified adolescent drug abusers at a drug abuse treatment facility, those patients with a score of 6 or more were considered high risk for \"red flag\" behaviors, particularly drug or alcohol abuse. Forty (77%) of those patients who scored six or greater identified themselves by name. Four key items on the questionnaire accounted for 70 percent of the variation between those at high and those at low risk for drug or alcohol abuse. These four most important items encompassed 1) use of tobacco products; 2) accusation by others of having a drinking or drug problem; 3) school suspension; and 4) riding in a motor vehicle with a driver who drank too much. The DAP Quick Screen appears to be practical as a screening tool in physician's offices for detection of serious problems during adolescence.\r"

  ".W": "The identification of opiate receptors in the spinal cord gave rise to the suggestion that the use of intrathecal and epidural narcotics may provide effective and safe postoperative analgesia. The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of ten children who received intrathecal morphine as part of their anesthetic care over the last 2 years. Preservative-free morphine (Duramorph) in a dose of 0.02 mg/kg was administered to all patients in the lumbar intrathecal space before the start of the surgical procedure. Adequate postoperative analgesia was achieved in the ten children. No patient required supplemental analgesic agents for the initial 15-hour postoperative period. Surgical procedures included exploratory laparotomy, laryngotracheoplasty, and craniofacial reconstruction. As with narcotics administered by any route, intrathecal morphine can cause respiratory depression, and such depression may be delayed for up to 24 hours after the dose. Therefore, the postoperative respiratory status of these children should be monitored for 24 hours after the dose, preferably in an intensive care unit. With this caveat, the use of intrathecal morphine provides safe and effective postoperative analgesia in children undergoing major surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacodynamic models for \"directly suppressive\" effects of methylprednisolone are based on the premise that receptor interactions of steroids are followed by immediate suppression of either the circadian secretion of cortisol or the constant rate recirculation of histamine-containing basophils that persists until inhibitory concentrations of methylprednisolone disappear. Methylprednisolone doses of 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg were given as the 21-succinate sodium salt in a balanced crossover study to six normal men. Plasma steroid concentrations and blood histamine were measured simultaneously. Both forms of methylprednisolone exhibited linear kinetic parameters. One dynamic model quantitates the baseline circadian pattern and the decline and return of cortisol with similar parameter estimates for all three dose levels. A similar model describes the monoexponential decline and the log-linear return to steady-state baseline of blood histamine. Similar inhibitory concentration values for both effects approximated the equilibrium dissociation constant of in vitro steroid receptor binding. The new models are more physiologically appropriate for these steroid effects than three other models that are commonly employed in pharmacodynamics. Steroid effects generally appear to be receptor mediated with either nongene immediate responses or gene-mediated delayed effects. These models allow quantitation of the rapid effects of steroids with simple equations and common fitted parameters for all steroid dose levels.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of two calcium antagonists on hemodynamics and on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics were studied in eight transplant patients (four heart-transplant and four kidney-transplant patients) by use of a single-blind, randomized, crossover, and placebo-controlled design. Patients received, at least 1 week apart, either 90 mg diltiazem, 20 mg nifedipine (in tablet form), or placebo, given 1 hour before cyclosporine. Cyclosporine and its main metabolite (metabolite 17) were measured in plasma (separated at 25 degrees C) by use of HPLC. Both calcium antagonists tended to increase absorption rate and elimination rate, but none of the pharmacokinetic parameters of cyclosporine were significantly altered. Moreover, the area under the curve of plasma concentrations of metabolite 17 did not change. On the other hand, both nifedipine and diltiazem significantly altered the hemodynamics, but to a different extent in the two groups of patients. The heart-transplant patients showed larger decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than the kidney-transplant patients after administration of both nifedipine and diltiazem, but they showed smaller increases in cardiac index and heart rate with nifedipine. In contrast, diltiazem caused small decreases in heart rate and cardiac index in heart-transplant patients and small increases in heart rate and cardiac index in kidney-transplant patients. We conclude that a single dose of either nifedipine or diltiazem does not affect, to a clinically significant extent, the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine. In addition, heart-transplant patients show different hemodynamic responses to these two calcium antagonists than the responses shown by kidney-transplant patients, probably because of cardiac denervation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of alteration of gastric pH and food on the pharmacokinetics of 200 mg doses of cefpodoxime proxetil tablets were studied in two separate randomized, open label, crossover studies in healthy subjects. In the pH study (n = 17 subjects), there was a lead-in period done under fasting conditions, followed by randomization to a four-way crossover of pentagastrin (6 micrograms/kg, subcutaneously), ranitidine (150 mg orally, 10 and 2 hours before dosing with the antibiotic), sodium bicarbonate (12.6 gm), or aluminum hydroxide (120 cc). Gastric pH was determined by nasogastric aspirates before and 10 minutes after the intervention, just before the antibiotic was given. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were highest in fasting and pentagastrin periods and were 35% to 50% lower for all of the other periods (p less than 0.0001). Gastric pH and Cmax and AUC were inversely related (r = 0.66 and r = 0.62; p less than 0.0001 for both). In the food study (n = 16 subjects), there were two lead-in periods, one done while subjects were fasting and one while they were normal diet, followed by randomization to a four-way crossover of either high or low protein diets, or high or low fat diets. There were six meals in each diet. Dosing with the antibiotic was done at the midpoint of the fourth meal. Cmax and AUC were 22% to 34% higher for all diets than for the fasting period (p less than 0.0001), whereas the time to Cmax was unchanged. These studies demonstrated that absorption of cefpodoxime proxetil is best at low gastric pH or in the presence of food, which suggests that the role of gastrointestinal function on the pharmacokinetic profile is complex.\r"

Copals and damars are produced by trees belonging to the Araucariaceae, Caesalpiniaceae, Dipterocarpaceae and Burseraceae families. We suggest that the word \"copal\" be reserved for the resins of the Caesalpiniaceae and that of \"damar\" for the resins of the Dipterocarpaceae. The resins of the Araucariaceae are special products that may be called Manilla resin and kauri resin, which are relatively different from each other. As far as the soft resins of the Burseraceae are concerned, it would be appropriate to use the word \"elemi\". The component resin of the surgical adhesive implicated (Alphacopal) is a Manilla resin, produced by a variety of Agathis dammara (Lamb.) Rich., native to the Philippines.

Patients were retrospectively divided on the basis of whether they required assisted ventilation for acute respiratory failure (ARF) or for another reason. Sixteen (59%) courses of assisted ventilation were for ARF. The PICU mortality rate was 81% for the ARF group. Eleven (41%) courses of assisted ventilation were for reasons not involving ARF. The PICU mortality rate for the group without ARF was 9%, significantly lower (p less than .01) than for the ARF group. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was documented during 48% of admissions. Occurrence of PCP did not affect mortality, nor was it more likely in those with than without ARF. Two patients with ARF survived to discharge from the hospital. Both died within 1 yr of ARF. Thus, the short-term prognosis for pediatric AIDS patients requiring assisted ventilation for ARF is extremely poor.\r"

Mean Po2 rose from 62 to 158 torr, respiratory rate decreased from 51 to 32 breath/min, and Pco2 was unchanged. Mean duration of treatment was 4.5 days. Only one patient developed a pneumothorax; there were no other major complications. Hospital mortality was 55%. CPAP by face mask allows speech and permits discussion of therapeutic limits. We present our protocol for using CPAP by face mask and conclude that CPAP is effective supportive therapy in hypoxic respiratory failure complicating PCP and AIDS.\r"

We therefore investigated renal hemodynamics and the renal excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a nonhuman primate model of severe, low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) SS. In 18 cynomolgus monkeys, SS was induced by an infusion of 3 x 10(10) live Escherichia coli per kg; five saline-treated animals served as nonseptic controls. Systemic and renal hemodynamics, and urine PGE2 concentrations were determined over the 3 h after the induction of sepsis. The septic group demonstrated a significant (p less than .001) and sustained depression in both mean arterial pressure and SVR. Septic animals also had significantly lower effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) (p less than .01) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (p less than .01) compared to controls. Furthermore, the renal hemodynamic response to SS was biphasic, with significant increases in ERPF and GFR in the second hour postsepsis, followed by a pronounced decrease in the third postseptic hour. The septic group also demonstrated an increase in the renal excretion of PGE2 (p less than .001) that was temporally associated with the transient recovery in renal hemodynamics during the second postseptic hour. These sepsis-induced renal alterations may be important in the pathogenesis of renal insufficiency complicating clinical SS.\r"

Escherichia coli O111:B4 LPS was added to water and pooled normal human plasma to a concentration of 200 ng/ml and aliquots were adsorbed in parallel with each of the materials. Plasma containing 25 ng/ml of LPS was obtained by plasmapheresis from a patient with fatal Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis and was similarly adsorbed. Ethanolamine bound to Sepharose 4B served as a control adsorbent. LPS was most readily removed from water and least readily removed from plasma obtained from the patient with sepsis. Nonetheless, some materials removed substantial quantities of LPS from the patient's plasma. Upon ip injection of control-adsorbed patient's plasma into LPS-sensitized mice, death occurred in 13 of 13 mice within 12 h. In contrast, when this plasma was first adsorbed with activated charcoal, Kaopectate, or polymyxin B bound to Sepharose 4B, death occurred 12 h after challenge in 0/13, 0/13, and 2/13 mice, respectively (p less than .0001 by actuarial life table analysis of survival distributions). Thus, plasma that contains bacterial toxins produced during Gram-negative bacterial sepsis can be detoxified by adsorption.\r"

In recent years it has been used at low infusion rates for its renal effects, in combination with other more specific inotropic or pressor agents. Lack of oral bioavailability has limited its use in long-term therapy, however; levodopa and dopa conjugates which are orally absorbed and metabolized to the active form are under investigation. The novel DA1 receptor agonist fenoldopam is claiming a role in the management of hypertension, heart failure, and the preservation of renal function. DA2 receptor agonists are also being evaluated as potential antihypertensive agents.\r"

Patients who subsequently died maintained relatively normal CI, DO2, and VO2 values in this period. Values of other variables in survivors and nonsurvivors were not appreciably different. An index based on these observations correctly predicted outcome in 94% in a subsequent prospective study. Two hypotheses: a) that increased flow and oxygen transport represent compensatory physiologic responses to an earlier tissue oxygen debt, and b) that these survivors' values were appropriate therapeutic goals, were tested in prospective randomized clinical trials. The protocol group attained those therapeutic goals. This resulted in significantly reduced mortality and morbidity. Optimal goals were more easily attained with colloids, red cells, and an inotropic agent, dobutamine. Dobutamine was used because, in a prospective crossover clinical trial with dopamine at various doses, dobutamine produced greater increases in flow and flow-related variables. More importantly, it improved tissue perfusion as reflected by greater increases in VO2 and greater reductions in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance.\r"

These agents increase intracellular Ca availability by increasing cyclic AMP levels and improve cardiac performance by (a) enhancing contractility, (b) reducing left ventricular afterload, and (c) improving diastolic compliance of the left ventricle. Increased cardiac work leads to an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption, but increased coronary flow prevents an imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Available data indicate that renal perfusion may increase as a result of the increase in cardiac output, but much of the decrease in systemic vascular resistance apparently occurs in musculoskeletal tissue. The hemodynamic improvements associated with these agents are well documented, but whether they actually affect the prognosis remains uncertain.\r"

Therefore, the clinician should avoid responding solely to hemodynamic data and should direct interventions toward delivering the optimum amount of oxygen to the patient's tissues.\r"

When blood pools in the periphery, venous return decreases and cardiac output can decrease without a primary myocardial defect being present. However, early heart dysfunction has been recognized in sepsis. Hemodynamic monitoring has not reduced overall mortality, but it has been helpful in guiding fluid administration and evaluating response to vasopressor therapy.\r"

If cardiac output is low or decreases as a function of therapy, flow may be increased with inotropic agents. When a marked decline in cardiac output complicates pulmonary embolism, norepinephrine may be an excellent drug for at least short-term maintenance of hemodynamic stability. When a moderate decrease in cardiac output complicates an increase in right ventricular afterload, isoproterenol or dobutamine may be used to increase flow.

In septic states, oxygen transport values are typically elevated, and the altered oxygen extraction (ratio of oxygen uptake over oxygen supply) limits the ability of the tissues to increase their oxygen uptake in relation to high oxygen needs. To correct tissue hypoxia, oxygen consumption should be increased to a level where oxygen uptake equals oxygen demand and lactic acidosis resolves. For a given level of oxygen demand, the best option is to improve oxygen extraction so that oxygen consumption will be higher for the same level of oxygen transport. This, however, is very difficult. Another approach can consist of further increasing oxygen transport to meet the elevated oxygen demand. Whenever possible, the metabolic needs of the tissues should be restrained.\r"

Using specific immunohistochemical methods for the detection of the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), however, varying degrees of eosinophil infiltration and extracellular deposit of ECP were disclosed in the achalasia specimens. The ECP also reacted with the monoclonal antibody, EG2, indicating secretion of the cytotoxic ECP. Few or no eosinophils were seen in the muscularis externa in specimens from six control patients without esophageal disease. In two controls many eosinophils were observed in the muscularis externa. However, no extracellular ECP was detected and very few eosinophils reacted with the monoclonal antibody (EG2), suggesting that these eosinophils were not activated. Depletion or total absence of peptidergic innervation was seen in all achalasia specimens but not in controls. Since the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), in its activated form, is cytotoxic, we propose a pathogenic role of the eosinophil infiltration in achalasia.\r"

Trypsinogen concentrations in plasma and pancreas increased in mice fed a CDE diet and further increased in mice fed a zinc-deficient diet. The plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin levels in mice fed a zinc-deficient diet decreased compared to those fed a zinc-adequate or a zinc-excess diet. In mice with pancreatitis, zinc and calcium concentrations of pancreata increased and magnesium concentrations decreased compared to those of normal controls. The calcium concentrations in both livers and pancreata increased, but magnesium concentrations in these tissues decreased. These results suggest that altered mineral metabolism in the pancreas may have contributed to the pathophysiology of the mice with acute pancreatitis and that zinc supplementation in the diet may be therapeutic for pancreatitis.\r"

These cases are compared with others in the literature, and the occult nature of these cancers, the spectrum of symptoms suggesting autonomic dysfunction on presentation, and the occasional response of the neurologic deficit to treatment of the malignancy are highlighted.\r"

  ".W": "Biliary secretion is reviewed. Bile acids pass along the biliary tract and small intestine without undergoing passive absorption because of their hydrophilicity and size. Active ileal absorption leads to the development of a large circulating pool of molecules and thus dissociates biliary secretion from bile acid biosynthesis (which is synonymous with cholesterol degradation). Man differs from most vertebrates in having little bile acid-independent flow; bile acid-dependent flow is also less in man than many other vertebrates. The hypercholeretic effects of certain bile acids are reviewed; the most likely explanation is cholehepatic shunting of the unconjugated, lipophilic species. Biliary lipid secretion involves bile acid-stimulated microtubule-dependent movement of phospholipid-cholesterol-rich vesicles from the Golgi to the canaliculus. Bile acid biotransformation during hepatic transport involves reconjugation (with glycine or taurine) of C24 bile acids (deconjugated during enterohepatic cycling), conjugation with glucuronate of lipophilic C23-nor bile acids, reduction of oxo groups, and epimerization of iso-(3 beta-hydroxy) bile acids. Glucose and amino acids enter bile from plasma as secondary solutes and are absorbed efficiently in the biliary ductular system. The biliary system is almost freely permeable to plasma Ca2+; in bile, Ca2+ is bound to bile acid monomers and micelles. Alteration of biliary lipid secretion by orally administered bile acids is a major first step in the medical treatment of calculous biliary disease.\r"

  ".W": "The balance between the synthesis of cholesterol and bile acids in the liver is a key factor in the formation of gallstones. Patients with cholesterol gallstones have been shown to have higher rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis and lower rates of bile acid synthesis than control subjects, as measured by the activity of the respective rate-controlling enzymes. Treatment with ursodiol reduced the high levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase in gallstone patients treated for approximately one year. Such treatment did not appear to inhibit endogenous synthesis of bile acids. Ursodiol is distinct from chenodeoxycholic acid in that no significant abnormalities of liver function have been reported during its use. Bacterial 7-dehydroxylation is more active for chenodeoxycholic acid than ursodiol; thus less lithocholic acid is formed with ursodiol. Patients receiving the highest dose of ursodiol often have been shown to have the lowest percentage of lithocholic acid in the bile. During treatment with ursodiol for dissolution of gallstones, symptoms of biliary distress began to improve after three to six weeks. Gallstones will recur in about 50% of patients, but no consensus exists on management of patients after dissolution of their stones. Overall, ursodiol is a safe and effective litholytic agent.\r"

  ".U": "90091732\r", 
  ".W": "This review focuses on mechanisms of bile acid transport across the basolateral and canalicular hepatocyte plasma membranes and on ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) hypercholeresis and biotransformation. Conjugated trihydroxy bile acids enter hepatocytes via a sodium-coupled mechanism localized to the basolateral membrane, which is saturable, concentrative, inhibited by other bile acids as well as by furosemide and bumetanide, and exhibits developmental changes in rats and probably also in humans. The stoichiometry of sodium-coupled bile acid uptake has been controversial. Hydrophobic, unconjugated dihydroxy and monohydroxy bile acids, including UDCA, enter hepatocytes more rapidly than does taurocholate, and their uptake is largely nonsaturable and sodium independent. A hydroxyl-exchange mechanism that mediates the uptake of cholic acid has also been reported, but its existence is controversial. Current evidence suggests that a 49-kDa protein mediates Na+-dependent taurocholate uptake and that a 54-kDa protein is involved in Na+-independent bile acid uptake. Studies with canalicular membrane vesicles have demonstrated saturable, sodium-independent taurocholate transport, which is sensitive to electrical potential, exhibits trans-stimulation, and appears to be mediated by a 100-kDa canalicular membrane glycoprotein. Studies in mutant rats with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia suggest the presence of a separate canalicular transport mechanism utilized by sulfated bile acids and organic anions such as bilirubin and sulfobromophthalein. UDCA produces in some species a dramatic hypercholeresis that is greater than expected based on the osmotic effect of the secreted bile acid. The hypercholeresis appears attributable to stimulation of biliary bicarbonate output and is decreased or abolished in the perfused rat liver by amiloride or perfusate Na+ substitution. These same maneuvers dramatically alter UDCA biotransformation (unconjugated UDCA disappears from bile, and UDCA glucuronide becomes a major metabolite) and lower hepatocyte intracellular pH. These and other findings indicate that UDCA hypercholeresis is tightly linked to biliary excretion of the unconjugated species and suggest that UDCA biotransformation may be influenced by intracellular pH.\r"

Footsole fibroblasts served as a control. The secretion of transferrin was used as an androgen-regulated parameter of Sertoli cell function. It is demonstrated that coculture of peritubular or stromal cells with Sertoli cells markedly increases the production of transferrin. This effect requires a 4-day latent period and is maximal with low concentrations (10%) of mesenchymal cells. Stimulatory effects of androgens can only be demonstrated at suboptimal concentrations of the latter cells. Fibroblasts are inactive. At least two mechanisms contribute to these stimulatory effects. Peritubular cells and stromal cells share the ability to promote the deposition of an extracellular matrix when cocultured with Sertoli cells. When Sertoli cells are seeded on this matrix, the production of transferrin is increased. This effect requires no latent period and is independent of the presence of androgens during the period of matrix deposition. In addition, peritubular cells and stromal cells produce diffusible mediators which increase transferrin production by Sertoli cells. In both cell types, the production of these mediators is controlled by androgens, and their action is preceded by a 4-day latency period. The mediators have a comparable mol wt (45,000) and resemble P Mod-S, known to be secreted by peritubular cells. These data suggest that mesenchymal-epithelial interactions play a role in androgen-supported maintenance of adult function and that mesenchymal tissue from different androgen target tissues produces similar or identical mediators of androgen action.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental diabetes adversely affects hypothalamic control of gonadotropin secretion and sex behavior and induces hyperphagia accompanied by severe body weight loss. Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) stimulates pituitary gonadotropin release, inhibits sexual behavior, and stimulates robust feeding in rats by acting at different sites in the hypothalamus. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that altered hypothalamic NPY neurosecretion may mediate the constellation of effects observed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats. Adult male rats were made diabetic by a single injection of STZ (50 mg/kg). Five months later, in vitro NPY release from the hypothalamic fragment encompassing the medial basal hypothalamus and preoptic area and NPY concentrations in seven hypothalamic sites were assessed. Basal NPY release was not significantly changed after STZ treatment. However, in response to a 30-min pulse of KCl (45 mM), NPY release from the medial basal hypothalamus-preoptic area of STZ-D rats was significantly increased compared to that in age-matched controls. In the STZ-D rats, NPY concentrations in six of the seven microdissected nuclei, including those mediating control of pituitary gonadotropin, sexual, and feeding behaviors, were increased compared to control values. In an additional study similar increments in NPY concentrations in the hypothalamic sites were observed 6 months after STZ treatment. The effects of insulin on NPY levels in microdissected hypothalamic sites in STZ-treated and BB diabetic rats was next assessed. One group of rats was treated with STZ, and the other group of rats was additionally treated with insulin (6 U/kg.day) for 3 months after development of diabetes with STZ. Again, STZ treatment alone, even for 3 months, increased NPY levels in all seven nuclei, including the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Insulin therapy completely prevented the STZ-induced increments in NPY levels in all hypothalamic sites, and the blood glucose level was 233 +/- 22 mg/dl in insulin-treated STZ-D rats and 496 +/- 6 mg/dl in untreated STZ-D rats. Similarly, NPY concentrations in five of the seven nuclei were unchanged in spontaneously diabetic BB rats (blood glucose, 435 +/- 67 mg/dl) maintained on insulin (5-8 U/kg.day). These results demonstrate that STZ-D rats have a widespread increase in NPY levels in hypothalamic sites, and there is an increase in the evoked release of NPY from the hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To further investigate this phenomenon, in the present studies, the effect of pulsatile (six pulses; 10 min on, 30 min off) and continuous infusion of P4 (Exp I) and 4-pregnen-20 alpha-ol-3-one or 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (20 alpha-OH-P; Exp II) on LHRH release were studied in vivo using push-pull cannulae. Furthermore, the effect of pulsatile infusion (six pulses; 10 min on, 30 min off) of low doses of the following three progestins [5 beta-pregnan-3 beta-ol-20-one (pregnanolone), 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (3 alpha-5 alpha-P), and 20 alpha-OH-P] into the hypothalamus of does using push-pull cannulae were examined in Exp III. In Exp I, continuous infusion of P4 at 10 ng/ml was unable to stimulate mean LHRH release. However, pulses of P4 at 0.01 ng/ml (n = 4) were found to significantly increase the amplitude of the largest LHRH pulse (control period, 1.18 +/- 0.41; versus treatment period, 3.15 +/- 0.75 pg; P less than 0.035) as well as the frequency of LHRH pulses (control period, 0.72 +/- 0.26; treatment period, 1.37 +/- 0.12 pulses/h; P less than 0.035). On the other hand, there was no effect of pulses of P4 at 0.001 ng/ml (n = 4) on the activity of the LHRH neural apparatus. In Exp II, pulses of 20 alpha-OH-P at 10 ng/ml (n = 4) were found to significantly increase the mean LHRH release (control period, 1.24 +/- 0.10; treatment period, 2.07 +/- 0.52 pg/10 min) as well as the amplitude of the largest LHRH pulse (control period, 0.99 +/- 0.36; treatment period, 8.15 +/- 3.75 pg). Interestingly, continuous infusion of 20 alpha-OH-P (10 ng/ml) also significantly increased the mean amplitude (control period, 0.58 +/- 0.34; treatment period, 1.90 +/- 0.29 pg) as well as the amplitude of the largest LHRH pulse (control period, 0.64 +/- 0.37; treatment period, 4.30 +/- 1.97 pg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Recent studies using a partial cDNA of PS beta G isolated from human term placenta detected the presence of mRNA highly homologous to placental PS beta G in a number of extraplacental tissues, including human and rat testis. The present study determined in the rat that the amount of PS beta G mRNA based on percentage of total tissue RNA was greatest in the testis of mature rats, followed by senescent and prepubertal rats. In experiments using rats with testicular feminization syndrome (Tfm) which exhibit end-organ insensitivity to androgen stimulation, slot blot analysis of testicular RNA showed reduced levels of PS beta G mRNA in Tfm rats compared to normal rats. Northern blot analysis of rat testicular RNA probed with a human placental PS beta G cDNA demonstrated the presence of a single mRNA species of 1.65 kilobases. Subsequent studies investigated whether proteins immunologically similar to PS beta G were present in the testes from normal and Tfm rats. The rat testes were perfused with fixative, and sections from paraffin-embedded tissues were treated with rabbit anti-human PS beta G, followed by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. Testes from the normal rat showed intense immunostaining in late spermatids (steps 16, 17, 18, and 19 of spermiogenesis), residual bodies, as well as cytoplasm of Leydig cells. Spermatozoa within the epididymis also demonstrated intense immunolabeling. Paraffin sections of the testes from the Tfm rat showed light diffuse cytoplasmic immunostaining in cells of the seminiferous tubules. Since spermiogenesis does not proceed normally, and no spermatids were seen, it was not possible to accurately stage the seminiferous tubules of the Tfm rat. The Leydig cells of the Tfm testes stained intensely, however, as was observed in the testes of the normal rat. These data suggest that the rat may provide an animal model for the investigation of the biological function and regulation of PS beta G in the testis.\r"

Under culture conditions, the majority of the cells were immunopositive to neurofilament antibody, and a significant number (7-10%) were reactive to beta EP antibody. Cultured cells were often electrically excitable and possessed voltage-activated ionic conductances. In culture, there was a progressive increase in immunoreactive beta EP (IR-beta EP) in both cells and media, reaching maximum values at 12-16 days. The majority of IR-beta EP in both cells and media corresponded to [125I]beta EP on gel chromatography and was similar to the form previously found in the hypothalamus. These findings suggest viability of the beta EP neurons and continuing synthesis of IR-beta EP during the culture period. To evaluate the influence of membrane depolarization on IR-beta EP release, the cells were challenged with 56 mM potassium. This treatment induced a significant increase in medium IR-beta EP. The depolarization-induced IR-beta EP release was dependent upon calcium, since a calcium channel blocker, verapamil (0.1 microM), prevented the release; also a calcium ionophore, A23187 (1 microM), stimulated IR-beta EP release in the cultures. Activation of the sodium channel by veratridine (100 microM) also increased the medium content of IR-beta EP, and this effect was blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 microM). These results suggest that the beta EP neurons in primary culture respond to the well defined physiological challenges and that the culture system can be used in determining the regulation of hypothalamic beta EP activity.\r"

Insulin infusion elevated IGF-II concentrations in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and suprachiasmatic nucleus, but decreased IGF-II in the paraventricular nucleus, lateral hypothalamus (LtH), and supraoptic nucleus compared to values in control animals. In separate parallel studies, the effects of 4 days of insulin injection (1 U insulin/rat, sc, twice daily) on brain IGF-II mRNA and peptide were determined. For RNA analysis the hypothalamus was divided into three regions (lateral, ventral, and dorsal). IGF-II mRNA content was shown to vary by an order of magnitude within the adult rat hypothalamus under control conditions, and there appeared to be a differential region-dependent response to insulin treatment. Relative abundance of IGF-II mRNA in control hypothalami was VH much greater than cortex greater than or equal to LtH greater than DMH. IGF-II mRNA content declined after insulin treatment in the VH, but rose in all other regions. Insulin increased IGF-II peptide content in the paraventricular nucleus, LtH, and VMH but decreased IGF-II in the DMH and suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results indicate that peripheral insulin status may be an important factor in the synthesis and secretion of IGF-II in the brain.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to analyze in detail the effects of L-glutamate (L-Glu) and its agonists on the release of LHRH from arcuate nucleus-median eminence (AN-ME) fragments in vitro. Fragments from adult male rats were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer in the presence of different concentrations of L-Glu, kainate (KA), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), and quisqualate (QA). L-Glu at 10-20 mM evoked a significant increase in basal LHRH release, while D-glutamate at similar concentrations was ineffective. Partial depolarization with 14 mM K+ significantly augmented the release of LHRH induced by L-Glu. L-Glu-induced LHRH release was blunted in a dose-related manner by the specific KA/QA receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. Exposure to KA or QA significantly increased LHRH release at concentrations (1 mM) much lower than those required for L-Glu. In the presence of 14 mM K+ the potencies of KA and QA (0.075 and 0.1 mM, respectively) were significantly enhanced. 6,7-Dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione blocked KA-induced LHRH release, while AP-7, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was inactive in preventing L-Glu- and KA-induced LHRH release. LHRH secretion from AN-ME fragments was unaffected by NMDA at concentrations up to 10 mM in the different media tested. A significant stimulatory effect of NMDA at 20 mM was observed when fragments were incubated in Mg2+-free medium. These results show the stereoselectivity of L-Glu to enhance LHRH release from AN-ME fragments in vitro. Moreover, in view of the respective potencies of excitatory amino acid agonists (KA = QA greater than L-Glu greater than NMDA) and the selective antagonism of excitatory amino acid effects, they provide evidence that non-NMDA receptors primarily mediate the excitatory actions of L-Glu on LHRH release from nerve terminals in the AN-ME.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the possibility that some of the metabolic effects of GH in rat adipose tissue depend upon phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions, we examined the effects of the isoquinoline sulfonamide family (H-7, H-8, and HA-1004) of protein kinase inhibitors on the actions of GH. In the course of these studies it became clear that these compounds may also block RNA synthesis. In the concentration range of 50-200 microM, H-7, H-8, and HA-1004 completely blocked lipolysis in response to the combination of 100 ng/ml dexamethasone and 30 ng/ml human GH in segments of epididymal fat from normal rats, but were less effective in blocking lipolysis in response to either 1 mM (Bu)2cAMP or 1 ng/ml isoproterenol, which are known to depend upon activation of protein kinase-A. Activation of protein kinase-C with phorbol myristate nearly doubled the rate of glucose oxidation in segments of normal adipose tissue, and this insulin-like response was completely inhibited with 200 microM H-7. At concentrations as high as 500 microM, H-7, H-8, and HA-1004 failed to inhibit the insulin-like response to GH in tissue segments of either normal or hypophysectomized rats. However, when 200 microM H-7 or H-8, but not HA-1004, was present during the first 3 h of treatment with GH, it prolonged the duration of the insulin-like response (acceleration of glucose oxidation) from its normal termination within 2-3 h to more than 4 h. Identical results were obtained with 5 micrograms/ml actinomycin-D. The effect of H-7 or H-8 was reversible and required the continuous presence of these agents, whereas actinomycin-D was required only during the first 60 min after GH. Termination of the insulin-like response normally is followed by a period of several hours in which the tissues are refractory to further insulin-like stimulation by GH. When actinomycin-D, H-7, H-8, or HA-1004 was added to tissues of hypophysectomized rats 60 min after GH, the insulin-like response terminated at its normal time, but the tissues were not refractory to insulin-like stimulation upon reexposure to GH. These agents also prevented GH from sustaining refractoriness in normal adipose tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Orchidectomy results in increased LH and FSH levels by removal of negative feedback at the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. However, the precise central nervous system mechanisms involved in elevation of gonadotropins after castration are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that catecholamine neuronal activity mediates the rise in serum LH that occurs after withdrawal of testosterone (T) negative feedback. The effects of acute and selective T withdrawal on brain catecholamine and LHRH activity and serum LH levels were determined in adult male rats. At the time of orchidectomy, rats were given sc implants of both T-containing and empty Silastic capsules. After recovery from surgery, the T-containing capsule was atraumatically removed from half of the animals (T-withdrawn), while the empty capsule was removed from the remaining rats (T-replaced). Rats were killed before and 6, 12, and 24 h after capsule removal. Serum T and LH levels were determined by RIA. Catecholamine content in microdissected nuclei of the LHRH neuronal system [medial preoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, retrochiasmatic area, arcuate nucleus (ARC), and median eminence (ME)] was measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Norepinephrine turnover rate was also determined in these areas by measuring the rate of decline of NE levels after blockade of synthesis with diethyldithiocarbamate. Additionally, LHRH content was measured by RIA within the ARC and ME. In T-replaced rats, the T capsules maintained serum T and LH levels within the normal range for intact male rats. In T-withdrawn rats, T levels fell into castrate range by 6 h after removal of the T capsule [0.12 +/- 0.04 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM); P less than 0.01 vs. T-replaced], and LH levels increased significantly from 0.23 +/- 0.04 ng/ml before capsule removal to 1.31 +/- 0.14 and 2.80 +/- 0.20 ng/ml 12 and 24 after T withdrawal, respectively (both P less than 0.01 vs. T-replaced). Despite a marked increase in serum LH levels, no significant changes in catecholamine content or NE turnover rate were observed in any of the hypothalamic nuclei of the LHRH neuronal system at any time after T withdrawal. ARC and ME LHRH levels also did not change significantly at any point after T withdrawal. These results suggest that activation of hypothalamic catecholamine neuronal activity is not required for the rise in serum LH levels after acute withdrawal of T negative feedback.\r"

  ".U": "90092008\r", 
  ".W": "The cellular mechanism(s) by which GH produces insulin resistance in peripheral tissues is poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that insulin exerts certain of its intracellular actions by rapidly activating phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C(s) (PI-PLC) in the plasma membranes of target cells. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether insulin can activate PI-PLC in adipose tissue of the genetically obese (ob/ob) mouse, an animal that responds markedly to GH with enhanced peripheral insulin resistance. Also, experiments were performed to determine whether the activation of PI-PLC by insulin could be blocked by S-carboxymethylated human GH (RCM-hGH), a GH derivative possessing mainly diabetogenic activity. Isolated adipose segments were incubated for various periods with insulin (10 mU/ml), homogenized and centrifuged to obtain a 150,000 x g pellet, and the latter was assayed for the ability to produce [3H]inositol phosphate from phosphatidyl[3H]inositol. PI-PLC activity was significantly stimulated 5 min after exposure of the segments to insulin. By 10 min, the insulin effect was no longer apparent, and after 30 min, insulin reduced the activity of the enzyme. One hour after exposure to insulin, PI-PLC activity returned to the control level. When adipose segments of RCM-hGH-treated mice (200 micrograms/day for 3 days sc) were incubated for 5 min with insulin, the ability of insulin to activate PI-PLC was abolished. However, RCM-hGH did not alter basal PI-PLC, indicating that its action involves the mechanism by which the enzyme is activated by insulin. Also, studies utilizing acute RCM-hGH treatment showed that its inhibitory effect on insulin activation of PI-PLC occurs within the same time frame as the onset of enhanced insulin resistance in the adipose tissue. Thus, the ability of GH to inhibit the activation of PI-PLC by insulin in adipocytes may account, at least in part, for its ability to induce insulin resistance in these cells.\r"

  ".W": "Suramin, a polyanionic compound which has been used in the treatment of trypanosomiasis and oncocerciasis, has recently been used in treatment of AIDS, while preliminary success has been reported in the treatment of cancer. However, suramin also causes adrenal insufficiency. The present study was undertaken in order to investigate the effect of suramin on ACTH-stimulated steroid production by dispersed rat adrenal cells. It was shown that suramin at concentrations of 10(-4)-10(-3) M inhibits ACTH-stimulated corticosterone release in a dose-dependent manner IC50 (2.10(-4) M). In addition, suramin caused a parallel decrease in ACTH-stimulated pregnenolone, progesterone and corticosterone release, suggesting that suramin does not affect corticosteroidogenesis via an inhibition of its regulatory enzymes. Suramin at 10(-4) M did not inhibit cholera toxin (10 mg/l)-, forskolin (5 microM)- and dbcAMP (5 mM)-stimulated corticosterone release, while cholera toxin completely overcame the inhibitory effects of very high concentrations of suramin (up till 10(-3) M), on ACTH-stimulated corticosterone release. Finally, chromatographic studies with a matrex gel showed that suramin directly interacted with the ACTH molecule. In conclusion, suramin at \"therapeutic\" concentrations (10(-4) M and higher) prevents ACTH-stimulated corticosterone release probably via a direct interaction with the ACTH molecule.\r"

Using a primary monolayer culture system, we investigated the proliferative activity of human (h) cord blood (CB) and highly purified AFP. hAFP, purified from hCB by Cibacron blue and immunoaffinity chromatography was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE and silver stain. Porcine granulosa cells from ovarian small follicles were cultured (25,000/cm2) for 2 days in medium (Ham's F-12:DMEM, 1:1) + 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) to facilitate attachment, followed by 6 days in medium containing: FCS, hCB or h amniotic fluid (1-20%)+/- EGF (10 ng/ml); or 0.25% plasma-derived serum (PDS) containing human low density lipoprotein (LDL, 25 ug/ml), +/- AFP (0.05-5 ug), and +/- EGF and IGF-I (10 ng/ml). In this system, single growth factors do not stimulate proliferation, a characteristic also exhibited by AFP. When combined with EGF, however, AFP dose-dependently increased proliferation to levels equal to that obtained with 10% FCS (2.3-fold increase vs PDS/LDL controls). When combined with EGF+IGF-I, AFP again dose-dependently increased proliferation to levels equal to that obtained with 10% FCS+EGF (6.7-fold increase vs controls). Purified human albumin used in place of AFP was not effective. TGF-a but not PDGF could replace the proliferative activity of EGF. These results suggest that AFP at physiological levels, although not itself mitogenic, can enhance the mitogenic activity of EGF and TGF-a and may function to modulate growth factor-mediated proliferation during development and neoplasia.\r"

After 2 months all endoprostheses were changed, and the amount and composition of the sludge in the patent stents was analyzed. Half of the patients dropped out. The major component (56%) of the sludge of all groups was protein. No insoluble residue was present. Major deposits of sludge were found at irregularities in the stent wall (side flaps). Both doxycycline and aspirin reduced the dry weight of the sludge. Doxycycline significantly reduced the amount of protein, but scanning electron microscopy still showed abundant bacterial growth. Aspirin reduced the content of all sludge components including protein, suggesting that it decreases \"stickiness\" of bile. Surprisingly, doxycycline significantly decreased the death rate in the 2 months of the study. We present further evidence for a primary role of protein deposition in the early stages of stent occlusion. This process can be partly inhibited by doxycycline and probably also by aspirin, which could lead to a significant increase in stent patency.\r"

To assess the value of laparoscopy compared with that of ultrasonography, we compared data obtained from a series of 54 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, all of whom had both procedures performed at nearly the same time. In our study, ultrasonography proved superior to laparoscopy in detecting the presence and extent of the hepatocellular carcinoma. Supplemental findings attributable to laparoscopy did not alter management, whereas additional information obtained by ultrasonography often did influence the choice of treatment. We conclude that ultrasonography is the primary diagnostic method of choice in the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma and that laparoscopy should be reserved for only selected cases.\r"

The effect of flumazenil was prompt and was clearly noticed at the first assessment, 5 min after its administration. In none of the patients was a relapse of the sedative effect of the benzodiazepines noticed. The administration of flumazenil was free of major side effects. Flumazenil administration permits an earlier discharge of patients following endoscopy. Its availability in the endoscopy suite may improve the outcome of serious but rare side effects related to benzodiazepines.\r"

Twenty-one percent of the BICAP and 29% of the CBx (p greater than 0.05) group had residual polypoid tissue detected at flexible sigmoidoscopy 3 weeks after treatment. Because of incomplete polyp removal, CBx and BICAP coagulation cannot be recommended as definitive therapies for DPs. Neoplasia was present in 22% of DPs located less than 60 cm from the anus, 73% of proximally located small polyps, and 32% of all DPs. Despite apparent eradication at the time of treatment, the incidence of residual polypoid tissue would suggest the need for critical evaluation of other modalities used to eradicate or remove DPs.\r"

A close doctor-patient relationship is regarded as central to these therapeutic tasks but the time required to maximise the effectiveness of this therapeutic role means that intensive psychological treatment should be reserved for those IBS patients who do not respond to first line standard medical treatment.

  ".W": "Beta-2-microglobulin (b2M) was identified as a causative agent of amyloidosis associated with long-term hemodialysis (HD). Therefore, we examined handling of b2M during a 4-hour hemodialysis session. We compared b2M adsoprtion and diffusive/convective elimination between high-flux membranes such as polysulfone (PS; F 60, Fresenius), polyacrylonitrile (AN 69; Filtral, Hospal) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN, PAN 12CX2, Asahi) and less permeable membranes such as cuprammonium rayon (CR; AM 160 H, Asahi) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA; BK-1.6 U, Toray). To calculate total elimination, arterio-venous differences of b2M were measured at 0, 5, 20, 60 and 240 minutes; dialysate concentration was analyzed to evaluate diffusive/convective transport. Differences between recovery in dialysate and total removal were regarded as amount removed by adsorption. Total elimination per 4-hour hemodialysis session and per m2 membrane surface was 154.7 +/- 12.3 mg for the PS, 137.8 +/- 28.4 mg for the AN 69, 179.8 +/- 47.5 mg for the PAN, 130.8 +/- 11.8 mg for the PMMA and 14.4 +/- 16.0 mg for the CR membrane. Diffusive/convective transport was 128.0 +/- 18.1 mg for PS, 54.7 +/- 8.1 mg for AN 69 and 106.5 +/- 20.8 mg for PAN and insignificant for PMMA and CR. Adsorption was 26.7 +/- 4.3 mg for PS, 83.1 +/- 29.0 mg for AN 69 and 59.8 +/- 17.2 mg for PAN. Besides transmembranous transport sorption is an important mode of elimination. Weekly endogenous generation rate is about twice as high as b2M elimination.\r"

Naloxone (NLX) (0.1 mg/kg) administration partially and transiently reversed the tidal volume depression seen during loading. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous opioid elaboration results in depression of respiratory output to the diaphragm. In six studies of five unanesthetized goats, tidal volume (VT), transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi), and arterial blood gases were monitored. A continuous NLX (0.1 mg/kg) or saline (SAL) infusion was begun 5 min before an inspiratory flow-resistive load of 120 cmH2O.l-1.s was imposed. Our data show that the depression of VT induced by the load was prevented by NLX as early as 15 min and persisted for 2 h. At 2 h, Pdi was still 294 +/- 45% of the base-line value compared with 217 +/- 35% during SAL. There was no difference in EMGdi between the groups at any time. However, the augmentation of Pdi was associated with a greater increase in end-expiratory gastric pressure in the NLX group. We conclude that the reduction in VT and Pdi associated with endogenous opioid elaboration is not mediated by a decrease in neural output to the diaphragm, but it appears to be the result of a decrease in respiratory output to the abdominal muscles.\r"

A high CHO meal was given 1) 4-h preexercise (M-4), 2) 8-h preexercise (M-8), 3) 4-h preexercise with CHO feedings during exercise (M-4CHO), and 4) 8-h preexercise with CHO feedings during exercise (M-8CHO). Blood samples were obtained at 0, 15, 60, 105, and 120 min and analyzed for lactate, glucose, insulin, and glycerol. Total work output during the performance ride was similar for the M-4 (217,893 +/- 13,348 N/m) and M-8 trials (216,542 +/- 13,905) and was somewhat higher for the M-4CHO (223,994 +/- 14,387) and M-8CHO (224,702 +/- 15,709) trials (P = 0.059, NS). Glucose was significantly elevated throughout exercise, and insulin levels were significantly elevated at 15 and 60 min during M-4CHO and M-8CHO compared with M-4 and M-8 trials. Glycerol levels were significantly lower during the CHO feeding trials compared with placebo and were not significantly different during exercise when the subject had fasted an additional 4 h. The results of this study suggest that when preexercise meals are ingested 4 or 8 h before submaximal cycling exercise, substrate use and performance are similar.\r"

The accuracy of each modality in assessing the upper and lower extent of aneurysmal disease was then compared. IV-DSA proved 100% accurate in assessing the relationship of the renal arteries to the aneurysm sac. Both CT and US overestimated the incidence of juxta or suprarenal AAAs and only had a predictive value for suprarenal disease of 13% and 14% respectively. If, however, US or CT stated the aneurysm to be infrarenal this was likely to be true though both investigations classified one suprarenal aneurysm as infrarenal. The distal extent of aneurysmal disease was again most accurately predicted by IV-DSA (predictive value 88%). Bowel gas frequently prevented US from visualizing the iliac arteries (19 of 25 cases). IV-DSA is a safe and accurate method for defining the relationship of an aneurysm to the renal arteries and should be adopted as a routine preoperative investigation of abdominal aneurysmal disease.\r"

The present study was performed to compare the synthesis and metabolism of neurotensin (NT) in normal subjects and four patients with NT-producing tumors. NT mRNA was measured and characterized using oligonucleotide probes and Northern blots, while NT-like peptides were quantitated by RIA with region-specific antisera and high pressure liquid chromatography. Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from normal human ileum revealed two species of mRNA hybridizing to a heterologous canine oligonucleotide probe; the apparent sizes of the mRNA were 1.4 and 1.0 kilobases. An identical pattern was found in a pancreatic endocrine tumor, a prostatic adenocarcinoma, and a fibrolamellar hepatoma. The ratio of mRNA to peptide varied between the different tissues. For instance, the hepatoma was the richest source of NT mRNA, but the prostatic tumor contained the highest peptide concentration. Measurements with region-specific antisera showed that N-terminal immunoreactive fragments were more abundant than C-terminal fragments in pancreatic, prostatic, and carcinoid tumors (N/C-teminal ratios, 4.0, 1.6, and 5.0) and in equal concentrations in normal ileum. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography revealed the presence of intact NT in addition to a variable number of smaller N-terminal peptides, presumed to be metabolites. In contrast the hepatoma contained a 5-fold excess of C-terminal immunoreactivity. The excess C-terminal immunoreactivity was also present in the circulation of this patient. The chromatographic properties, immunoreactivity, and unusual stability of the C-terminal fragment found in the hepatoma patient suggest that it is a substance distinct from NT itself and is released specifically by the fibrolamellar hepatoma.\r"

This assay detected MIS in human serum within the following criteria. Ninety-eight boys, aged between birth and 18 yr, who had been admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital, were included. MIS levels were measured in samples taken for biochemical screening of unrelated disorders. MIS was detected in the serum up to 16 yr of age, but was low beyond 12 yr and undetectable at 18 yr. High MIS levels were found at 4-12 months, consistent with MIS having an important function at this time. Germ cells undergo an important transformation from gonocytes to spermatogonia at the same time as the MIS levels peak, suggesting a possible function for MIS.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the contribution of the splanchnic area to the carbohydrate abnormalities associated with chronic uremia, the splanchnic exchange of glucose and gluconeogenic substrates was quantitated basally and after an iv glucose load in nine uremic patients with impaired glucose tolerance and seven control subjects. In the basal state, blood glucose and splanchnic glucose production were similar in the two groups. During glucose infusion (33 mumol/kg.min for 90 min), blood glucose reached significantly higher levels in the uremic patients than in controls (P less than 0.02). Plasma insulin increased slightly more in uremic patients than in controls (P less than 0.05 at 15 min). Both basal and postglucose glucagon levels were 2- to 3-fold higher in uremic patients than in normal subjects (P less than 0.05-0.02). In both groups, splanchnic glucose balance switched from net output in the basal state (-9.4 +/- 0.5 and -8.0 +/- 1.1 mumol/kg.min in normals and uremics, respectively) to net uptake with glucose infusion. However, this response was less marked in the uremic patients than in normal subjects (P less than 0.05-0.02 at 30 and 90 min). The cumulative net splanchnic glucose balance over the 90-min study period was 538 +/- 55 mumol/kg in normal subjects and 279 +/- 89 in uremic subjects (P less than 0.05). A net splanchnic lactate uptake was present in the basal state in normal (4.2 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg.min) and uremic subjects (3.4 +/- 0.5). During glucose infusion, in normal subjects splanchnic lactate exchange switched to a net output (-4.0 +/- 1.6 mumol/kg.min), whereas in the uremic group it remained as a net uptake (1.1 +/- 0.7) throughout the study period. Splanchnic gluconeogenic amino acid uptake was similar in the two groups in the basal state (1.8 +/- 0.1 mumol/kg.min and 2.2 +/- 0.2 in normal and uremic subjects, respectively). Glucose infusion caused a marked fall in amino acid uptake by liver in normal subjects, whereas no change was observed in the uremic group (0.9 +/- 0.3 and 1.9 +/- 0.2 mumol/kg.min, respectively). Splanchnic glycerol uptake was not different in the two groups in the basal state (0.75 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 mumol/kg.min) and decreased to a similar extent during glucose infusion. We conclude the following. 1) In uremic patients with glucose intolerance but normal fasting glycemia, the splanchnic metabolism of glucose and gluconeogenic substrates is normal in the postabsorptive state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A decline in plasma insulin and an increase in glucagon are known to occur during intense and/or prolonged exercise. However, it is not established whether changes in insulin and glucagon secretion are involved in the precise matching of hepatic glucose production to the enhanced glucose uptake by muscle during brief, low intensity exercise. We studied the effects of 30-min cycle exercise at 40% of maximal aerobic capacity in healthy subjects and C-peptide-deficient subjects with type 1 diabetes (IDDM) using [3-3H]glucose to estimate glucose turnover. Diabetic subjects were studied during continuous iv insulin infusion, which normalized glucose kinetics before experimental perturbations. In control (saline-infused) experiments, endogenous glucose appearance (Ra) increased by 80-90% above baseline to match the increase in glucose disappearance in both normal and IDDM subjects, even though the latter exercised at fixed levels of plasma free insulin, averaging 203 +/- 19 pmol/L. In other experiments, somatostatin was infused, and glucagon (1.0 ng/kg.min) and insulin (at two different rates) were maintained at constant levels. Infusion of insulin in normal subjects at doses sufficient to maintain constant peripheral plasma insulin was associated with no apparent effect on glucose turnover (plasma insulin, 80 +/- 21 pmol/L, compared to 52 +/- 5 pmol/L during saline; P = NS). However, insulin infusion at doses that normalized the portal insulin concentration (approximately 208 pmol/L) together with glucagon replacement inhibited the rise in glucose production in both normal and IDDM subjects. There were similar 45-55% reductions (P less than 0.03) of the increase in Ra seen with exercise in control experiments. When peripheral plasma free insulin (and presumably portal levels as well) were increased by about 20% in this experimental setting in IDDM (278 +/- 43 pmol/L), the suppression of Ra was even more profound, and Ra failed to increase at all with exercise. We conclude that the hormonal regulation of Ra in brief duration exercise in man does not necessitate the decrements in portal venous insulin observed under more intense exercise conditions as long as an exercise-induced glucagon secretory response can occur. Glucagon secretion alone cannot prevent hypoglycemia when portal venous insulin concentrations are increased by minimal amounts, such as in insulin-treated diabetics.\r"

  ".W": "The syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, which is not a primary disorder of the adrenal cortex, describes the association of an unexplained hypermineralocorticoid state with a decreased rate of peripheral 11 beta-hydroxydehydrogenation of cortisol to cortisone. Studies in this syndrome have led to the hypothesis that peripheral cortisol inactivation is the normal mechanism permitting specific mineralocorticoid recognition. This view reconciled developing evidence that the mineralocorticoid receptor itself could not distinguish between mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. The syndrome occurs in two forms. In both forms there is decreased turnover of a normal level of plasma cortisol, consistent with the view that delayed removal of the glucocorticoid from strategic receptor sites unmasks its potential mineralocorticoid agonism. In the type 1 variant, impaired 11 beta-hydroxydehydrogenation is reflected by an elevated cortisol/cortisone metabolite ratio. In three patients with the type 2 variant, this ratio was normal, suggesting that the rate of 11 beta-hydroxydehydrogenation was unimpaired. The hypertension and hypokalemic alkalosis of both forms are improved by spironolactone, but patients with the type 2 variant have responded somewhat better to the suppression of cortisol by dexamethasone.\r"

Mean baseline FEV1 was 96 +/- 3% predicted and mean provocative concentration of methacholine (milligrams per milliliter) required to decrease FEV1 by 20% (PC20) was 0.81 +/- 0.25 mg/ml of methacholine. On the 4 study days, baseline FEV1 was within 10% of the FEV1 on visit 1, and baseline PC20 was within one doubling dose of visit 1. Each day patients inhaled either placebo, salbutamol, 200 micrograms, formoterol, 12 micrograms, or formoterol, 24 micrograms. FEV1 and PC20 were measured repeatedly during 12 hours. After placebo inhalation, mean FEV1 did not change significantly during 12 hours. After salbutamol inhalation, the mean FEV1 was significantly increased for less than 3 hours, but after formoterol inhalation, 12 or 24 micrograms, the mean FEV1 was significantly increased for 12 hours. After placebo treatment, mean PC20 did not change significantly. After salbutamol inhalation, mean PC20 was significantly increased for only 3 hours, but after formoterol inhalation, 12 or 24 micrograms, mean PC20 was significantly increased for 12 hours. Protection by formoterol, 12 and 24 micrograms at 12 hours, was equivalent to protection by salbutamol at 3 hours. Inhaled formoterol is a potent, long-acting bronchodilator and provides significantly better antiasthma protection than inhaled salbutamol.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the sources of IgG in nasal secretions, nasal provocation tests with histamine (H) and methacholine (MC) were performed on 22 subjects. Nasal lavages were assayed for IgG, total protein, albumin (Alb), nonsecretory IgA (nonsIgA), and secretory IgA (sIgA). H stimulation dramatically increased the secretion of IgG, nonsIgA, and Alb and also increased the proportion of these proteins compared to total protein. H-induced protein secretion was significantly inhibited by nasal pretreatment with chlorpheniramine maleate but was unaffected by atropine sulfate. sIgA was also stimulated by H challenge, but unlike IgG and other vascular proteins, the proportion of sIgA to total protein (sIgA percent) decreased after H challenges. MC stimulation also increased secretion of IgG, Alb, nonsIgA, and sIgA but did not alter their proportions, compared to total protein. Topical atropine significantly inhibited secretion of all proteins, suggesting a mode of transportation mediated by glandular muscarinic receptor stimulation. Thus, MC can increase the amount of IgG secretion, whereas H increases both the amount and relative proportion of IgG in nasal secretions. These data suggest that pharmacologic stimulation of IgG into nasal secretions may be used as a total to modulate mucosal immunity.\r"

The results were compared to age, sex, atopic status, dose, and duration of the antiasthmatic medication, immunotherapy, severity of the disease, and presence or absence of myalgia. The patients had mild to moderate asthma. The incidence of fluorescent anticytoplasmic antibodies (FACA) in the sera of patients with asthma was statistically significant (p = 0.02) in comparison to FACA in the sera of the control subjects. The combined incidence of fluorescent antinuclear antibodies (FANA) and FACA was found to be significantly higher among atopic subjects with asthma (p = 0.03) and the subjects with asthma and with myalgia (p less than 0.05). The 20% incidence of FACA in this group of subjects with asthma was significantly greater (p less than 0.0001) than the reported 2.7% incidence of FACA in a group of patients with various rheumatologic diseases. Variables, such as dose and duration of antiasthma medications and immunotherapy did not appear to influence the presence of FANA and FACA in their sera. The significance of positive FANA and FACA in this group of subjects with asthma is not known and needs to be evaluated by long-term studies.\r"

ACSs and SCSs should be regarded as different kinds of drugs, and both drugs are needed in the treatment plan. The ways in which these drugs act in patients with asthma to reduce BHR are largely unknown, but ongoing research, based on biopsy specimens, may well provide important clues about their actions and thus about the causes of asthma.\r"

Patients maintained usual levels of exercise and diet for 24 weeks. Eight subjects dropped out. For the group starting fish oil (n = 13), the average baseline cholesterol level was 6.336 mmol/L (245.0 mg/dL) and was 6.341 mmol/L (245.2 mg/dL) after 12 weeks. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) baseline levels were 1.459 mmol/L (56.4 mg/dL) and 4.332 mmol/L (167.5 mg/dL); 1.474 mmol/L (57.0 mg/dL) and 4.479 mmol/L (173.2 mg/dL), respectively, after fish oil supplementation. In the group that began with olive oil (n = 12), baseline total cholesterol level was 6.274 mmol/L (242.6 mg/dL); HDL-C and calculated LDL-C baseline levels were 1.386 mmol/L (53.6 mg/dL) and 3.988 mmol/L (154.2 mg/dL). When mean baseline levels were compared with post-fish-oil values for the entire population, no significant change in total cholesterol or LDL-HDL ratio was obtained. Triglyceride responses to fish oil were variable. Values after olive oil treatment were neither significantly different from baseline nor different from fish oil. It was concluded that fish oil in manufacturer's recommended dosage does not appear to lower moderately elevated cholesterol levels.\r"

The symptoms of allergic rhinitis are primarily dependent upon the tissue effects of histamine. Antihistamines are the mainstay of therapy for allergic rhinitis. Recently, a second generation of antihistamines has become available. These agents lack the adverse effect of sedation, which is commonly associated with older antihistamines. Current practice of antihistamine therapy in allergic rhinitis often involves random selection among the various agents. Based upon the available clinical trials, chlorpheniramine appears to be the most reasonable initial antihistaminic agent. A nonsedating antihistamine should be used initially if a patient is involved in activities where drowsiness is dangerous. In this comprehensive review of allergic rhinitis and its treatment, the current as well as future options in antihistamine pharmacotherapy are emphasized.\r"

  ".W": "From June, 1982, through June, 1985, 113 patients were evacuated to Rambam Maimonides Medical Center with penetrating craniocerebral injuries sustained in ongoing military hostilities in Lebanon. Two factors distinguished this group of patients from those presenting in earlier conflicts: 1) this was the first large series in which computerized tomography (CT) was routinely used to initially evaluate combat head injuries; and 2) in an effort to preserve maximum cerebral tissue, intracranial debridement was significantly less vigorous than that advocated during the Korean or Vietnam conflicts. No efforts were made to locate or remove in-driven bone or metal fragments visualized on CT unless they readily presented themselves on gentle irrigation. In fact, it was elected to treat a number of patients without intracranial hematomas nonoperatively. The acute outcome was quite similar to that reported in Vietnam series in respect to both complications and mortality. Of the 83 survivors, 46 were Israeli citizens and thus were available for follow-up review. These 46 patients were reevaluated in late 1988, a mean follow-up period of 5.9 years. None had died in the interim; 10 had developed chronic seizure disorders, and there was one case of delayed meningitis in a patient with no retained fragments. Repeat CT scans were performed on 43 patients; 22 (51%) were found to have retained intracranial bone fragments. No relationship existed between the presence of retained fragments and the development of either a seizure disorder or an infection of the central nervous system. These findings suggest that not only is it unnecessary to reoperate for retained bone fragments, but it may also be possible to temper the initial debridement in an effort to preserve additional cerebral tissue.\r"

The metabolic response to drum dried flour, which constitutes the major component in instant gruel and porridge, was also studied in healthy human subjects. Boiled flour was used for comparison. The degree of starch gelatinization and rate of starch hydrolysis in vitro were also measured. Incompletely gelatinized steam flaked and dry autoclaved products were digested more slowly in vitro and elicited lower glucose responses in rats compared with completely gelatinized drum dried, extrusion cooked or boiled samples. The initial glycemic response in rats was closely related to the rate of starch hydrolysis in the pepsin/alpha-amylase assay (r = 0.91, P less than 0.04). When pepsin was omitted, no significant correlation was obtained. The peak glucose, insulin and C-peptide responses in humans after breakfast meals of porridge prepared from drum dried flour and from boiled flour were similar, whereas the rate of depression of the glucose curve was more rapid after consuming drum dried porridge. It is concluded that the glycemic response to wheat products is affected by the processing conditions used. The more severe the processing conditions, the more rapid the digestion of starch.\r"

  ".W": "Biting and scratching behaviors produced by intrathecal injection of excitatory amino acid (EAA) agonists were examined to determine whether the biting and scratching behavioral effects produced by these compounds are altered selectively in vivo by coadministration with divalent cations. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced behavior was inhibited by both magnesium and calcium but not by zinc. Kainic acid (KA)-induced behavioral activity was also inhibited by coadministration with calcium but not by magnesium or zinc. In contrast to both NMDA and KA, calcium, magnesium and zinc failed to alter the intensity of quisqualic acid (Quis)-induced biting and scratching behaviors. Based on this selective inhibition of the three EAA subtypes by divalent cations, we examined the behavioral responses produced by Glu and Asp in combination with calcium or magnesium to identify the receptor population involved in these motor effects. Calcium antagonized the biting and scratching behavior produced by i.t. injected Glu in contrast with Asp which was inhibited significantly by magnesium. Our results support the concept that Glu and Asp produce biting and scratching behaviors by an interaction with distinct receptor populations in the spinal cord. To date, there are no selective antagonists at the KA or Quis receptors. Thus, a systematic examination of the selective inhibition of EAA activity by divalent cations in addition to currently available pharmacologic antagonists may prove to be a useful approach to the identification of NMDA, KA and Quis receptor interactions.\r"

Independent experimentation suggests substance P and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) administered intrathecally (i.t.) can act as putative pain neurotransmitters to stimulate afferent pathways mediating nociception. The present studies were designed to determine whether a functional link exists between these observations. Mice were administered morphine i.c.v. 15 min before i.t. injections of substance P or NMDA. Additional investigations utilized coadministration of substance P or NMDA i.t. with one of several antagonists. Morphine administered i.c.v. inhibited both substance P- and NMDA-induced behavior in a dose-dependent manner. Coadministration of noradrenergic or adenosine receptor antagonists with substance P or NMDA i.t. dose-dependently reversed morphine (i.c.v.)-mediated inhibition. Methysergide injected i.t. caused significant, but only partially effective, antagonism of the effects of morphine (i.c.v.). Naloxone coadministered i.t. was effective in reversing morphine (i.c.v.)-mediated inhibition of NMDA-induced behavior, but ineffective in the substance P assay. These data demonstrate a functional link between activation of descending systems mediating antinociception by morphine (i.c.v.) and inhibition of putative pain neurotransmitters by spinally active antinociceptive agents. The potential involvement of serotonergic and opioid spinal systems is not clear, but noradrenergic and adenosine spinal pathways appear to play an important role in the indirect actions of morphine (i.c.v.). Differences in the inhibition of NMDA- and substance P-induced behavior also provide evidence for the presence of substance P and NMDA receptors in separate afferent pathways transmitting nociceptive stimuli.\r"

Effects on overt behavior, cortical EEG power spectra, locomotor activity and rotarod performance were assessed. Quantitative EEG spectral parameters (peak, mean and edge frequency; total and relative power; time domain descriptors mobility and complexity) were analyzed from the global frequency range of 1 to 50 Hz. Increasing doses of each drug produced increases in EEG spectra power from 1 to 50 Hz which was associated with a slowing of the peak frequency. PCP and MK-801 produced decreases in the mean frequency, mobility and edge frequency whereas (+)-SKF-10,047 produced increases in these spectral parameters. Moreover, (+)-SKF-10,047 increased complexity whereas MK-801 decreased complexity and PCP did not change this parameter. Total spectral power from 20 to 50 Hz was increased by (+)-SKF-10,047 and PCP, but was not changed by MK-801. Each drug increased spontaneous locomotor activity. At the highest doses, PCP and MK-801 decreased activity whereas (+)-SKF-10,047 was lethal. Each drug disrupted rotarod performance. The rank order of potency for each effect was: MK-801 greater than PCP greater than (+)-SKF-10,047. The data indicate that subtle differences in the effects of these drugs can be detected using EEG power spectral analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arterial blood samples were taken to determine the rhG-CSF concentrations by measuring its activities using a modified [3H]thymidine assay. After the i.v. dose of 100 micrograms/kg, the half-lives were 25 (alpha) and 102 min (beta). Subcutaneous administration at the 100-micrograms/kg dose resulted in a lower peak serum level but, after 2 hr, rhG-CSF level after the s.c. dose was higher than that of the i.v. dose. The bioavailability of the s.c. dose of 100 micrograms/kg was 78%. The effect of rhG-CSF administration in rats was a specific activity on the neutrophil lineage with increase of neutrophils in peripheral blood. Intravenous and s.c. administration of rhG-CSF had identical effects on the peak neutrophil counts in peripheral blood but, at 24 hr after injection, neutrophil counts after the s.c. dose was greater than that of the i.v. dose. These results indicate the close relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rhG-CSF in the rats.\r"

  ".W": "Rapid-pressor and slow-pressor responses to angiotensin (ANG) II and norepinephrine (NE) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto control rats (WKY) were examined. All animals were treated from 4 wk of age with captopril (100 mg/kg/day in drinking water) to prevent development of hypertension so that changes in responsiveness could not be attributed to disparate base-line blood pressures or to hypertension-induced injury of the cardiovascular system. In 11-wk, conscious, unrestrained, captopril-treated rats, ANG II and NE induced rapid-pressor responses (i.e., a rapid increase in arterial blood pressure that reached a maximum within 10 min) that were of similar magnitude in SHR and WKY. In an additional group of 9-wk captopril-treated rats, both ANG II and NE caused slow-pressor responses (i.e., a slow increase in arterial blood pressure over 2 wk). Although the slow-pressor response to NE was similar in SHR versus WKY, the slow-pressor response to ANG II was much greater in SHR compared with WKY. Further studies were conducted in captopril-treated (from 4 wk of age) SHR and WKY to investigate whether the increased slow-pressor response to ANG II in SHR was mediated by an enhanced ability of ANG II to potentiate peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission, contract vascular smooth muscle, increase sympathetic tone to nonadrenal sites, release aldosterone, and/or reduce renal function. No evidence was found that supported a role for the aforementioned nonrenal actions of ANG II. However, 11-wk captopril-treated SHR were 10-fold more sensitive to the antidiuretic, antinatriuretic, and renal vascular effects of intrarenal infusions of ANG II compared with captopril-treated WKY. Also, chronic (1 wk) intrarenal infusions of a very low dose of ANG II (1 ng/min) caused a marked slow-pressor response in 11-wk captopril-treated SHR but did not alter arterial blood pressure in WKY. We conclude that 1) the slow-pressor response to ANG II is greatly enhanced in SHR, 2) this enhancement is specific with respect to type of response (slow not rapid) and pressor agent (ANG II not NE), 3) a genetic defect underlies the increased slow-pressor response to ANG II in SHR, and 4) the enhanced slow-pressor response to ANG II contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of hypertension in SHR. Finally, the current studies are consistent with our working hypothesis that the kidneys mediate the enhanced slow-pressor response to ANG II in SHR.\r"

Thirty-six of the 65 patients (55%) who were randomly assigned to selection of a drug by the clinician actually received a drug; these patients were able to be evaluated for clinical response. Of these 36 patients, one had a partial tumor response (3%). Only 19 of the 68 patients (28%) who were randomly assigned to selection of a drug by the capillary system actually received a drug; these patients were able to be evaluated for clinical response. Of these 19 patients, four (21%) had partial tumor responses. In the assessable patients (36 in the clinician's choice group, 19 in the capillary cloning group), the partial response rate was superior for drug selection by the capillary cloning system (P = .04). For all patients randomly assigned to a group (65 in the clinician's choice group, 68 in the capillary cloning group), the response rate was not significantly different (1.5% and 5.9%, respectively; P = .37). When overall survival rates for patients in the two groups were compared, there was no difference. We conclude that drug sensitivity testing in capillary tubes can improve the response rate for patients with advanced malignancies. This improved response rate, however, does not translate into improved survival times for these patients.\r"

  ".W": "We devised a novel clinical protocol for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), selecting chemotherapy whenever possible on the basis of in vitro drug-sensitivity testing (DST) of individual patients' tumor specimens. Most of the specimens were obtained from metastatic sites during routine staging procedures. Increase of tumor cell number by culture in selective media usually was required before DST could be performed. We used the Weisenthal dye exclusion assay to place the seven drugs in rank order and to select the in vitro best regimen (IVBR), a three-drug combination of proved efficacy in SCLC. After initial staging and specimen acquisition, patients received etoposide and cisplatin (primary therapy) and were restaged after 12 weeks. Patients with partial or no responses and those relapsing after a complete response to primary therapy were switched to the IVBR if DST data were available. If DST data were unavailable, an empiric combination, vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide, was administered as secondary therapy. Tumor-containing specimens were collected from 60 of the 80 patients (75%). One or more cell lines were established from 28 patients, and DST data were available from 26 patients (33% of total). Several parameters of in vitro drug sensitivity were significantly associated [two-sided P (P2) less than .05] with clinical response to primary therapy and also with response to the IVBR and were marginally associated with length of survival (.07 less than or equal to P2 less than or equal to .08). Sixteen patients (23%) received their IVBR as secondary therapy, and four of these (25%) attained a complete response, compared with three of 43 (7%) who received an empiric regimen (P2 = .16). We concluded that (a) selection of individualized chemotherapy is labor intensive but feasible in extensive-stage SCLC; (b) DST data are associated with clinical response to primary therapy and to secondary therapy with an IVBR; and (c) further observations will be required if we are to determine whether there is a modest therapeutic benefit to administering the IVBR as a secondary therapy.\r"

We have recently described a glycoprotein factor in fetal serum that stimulates deposition of hyaluronic acid. In a survey of bovine fetal tissue extracts, we have identified the fetal kidney as the source of this circulating activity. Wilms' tumors arise from transformed \"rests\" of fetal kidney. We demonstrate here that such tumors continue to produce this fetal factor and that the hyaluronic acid-stimulating activity is found in the urine of children with Wilms' tumors. In the three patients with Wilms' tumor who were followed, elevated levels of hyaluronic acid-stimulating activity were found in their urine before treatment. By 2 months after surgical removal of their tumors, these levels had returned to baseline. We propose that hyaluronic acid-stimulating activity is the mechanism for the elevated levels of hyaluronic acid in the sera and urine of these patients. The activity is an oncofetal protein and the first for which a function has been identified. It also is a marker for this common childhood solid tumor and has the potential for identifying children at increased risk.\r"

  ".W": "It is difficult for anyone to determine why oncologists have not paid more attention to the use of in vitro predictive tests in the care of their patients. A review of already completed in vitro-in vivo correlative trials in 2,300 patients indicates percentages of 69 for true positives and 91 for true negatives from predictive assays. These percentages are as good as or better than those seen with already accepted tests, such as estrogen receptor assays or bacterial sensitivity testing systems. Results of a randomized trial of single-agent chemotherapy selections based on a capillary cloning assay versus a clinician's choice indicate the response rate is significantly higher when single-agent chemotherapy is selected by the cloning assay than when it is selected by a clinician (21% vs. 3%). An ongoing randomized trial in which investigators are attempting to corroborate these results in patients with previously untreated small cell lung cancer has been so slow to accrue patients that it is unlikely these trials and others will ever be completed. The usefulness, if any, of these assays and their potential to provide answers to important questions will never be determined unless attitudes are changed about participation in trials. A tool with potential for helping oncologists select patient therapy could be lost unless participation in these trials is obtained.\r"

  ".U": "90096214\r", 
  ".W": "Histamine poisoning results from the consumption of foods, typically certain types of fish and cheeses, that contain unusually high levels of histamine. Spoiled fish of the families, Scombridae and Scomberesocidae (e.g. tuna, mackerel, bonito), are commonly implicated in incidents of histamine poisoning, which leads to the common usage of the term, \"scombroid fish poisoning\", to describe this illness. However, certain non-scombroid fish, most notably mahi-mahi, bluefish, and sardines, when spoiled are also commonly implicated in histamine poisoning. Also, on rare occasions, cheeses especially Swiss cheese, can be implicated in histamine poisoning. The symptoms of histamine poisoning generally resemble the symptoms encountered with IgE-mediated food allergies. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24 h. Antihistamines can be used effectively to treat this intoxication. Histamine is formed in foods by certain bacteria that are able to decarboxylate the amino acid, histidine. However, foods containing unusually high levels of histamine may not appear to be outwardly spoiled. Foods with histamine concentrations exceeding 50 mg per 100 g of food are generally considered to be hazardous. Histamine formation in fish can be prevented by proper handling and refrigerated storage while the control of histamine formation in cheese seems dependent on insuring that histamine-producing bacteria are not present in significant numbers in the raw milk.\r"

These agents also are used to treat benign conditions, such as lupus erythematosis and Wegener's granulomatosis. Radiation effects from treatment of prostatic or cervical carcinoma can appear for the first time as late as 15 to 20 years after initial treatment. Other iatrogenic causes of bleeding include treatment with penicillins and, rarely, danazol. Occasionally, bladder hemorrhage may be the presenting sign of metabolic disease, such as secondary amyloidosis in rheumatic arthritis. Cases of mild to moderate hemorrhagic cystitis arising in the otherwise healthy patients should lead one to pursue the possibility of environmental toxins, accidental poisoning, recreational drug use or viruses. In all cases the diagnosis should be reserved until more common causes of hematuria, such as bacterial or fungal infection, stones, cysts or tumors, have been ruled out. Prevention of chemotherapeutically induced cystitis ideally will follow careful attention to adequate hydration and the prophylactic use of antitoxins, such as mesna. Treatment, as outlined previously, consists of a series of measures beginning with the most conservative. Intervention thereby is tailored to the gravity of the clinical situation.\r"

Our study shows that there is a significant decrease in renal function following untreated acute bacterial pyelonephritis due to nephron loss. The acute inflammatory response is responsible for much of the renal damage, although damage from renal ischemia is an additional significant factor. The present study used a combination of an antibiotic and a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (allopurinol) as compared to antibiotic therapy alone begun 72 hours after infection. Both were successful in eradicating the infection rapidly, but did not entirely prevent renal damage. Treatment prior to 72 hours thus is important. It appears that the combined treatment, designed to eradicate the bacteria as well as reduce the post-ischemic reperfusion damage and the phagocytic burst of phagocytosis is ideal, as this combined treatment was effective in preventing almost all renal damage and loss of renal function.\r"

These data suggested a role for mutated ras genes in the initiation and maintenance of this disease. Therefore, to assess the involvement of ras genes in renal carcinogenesis, 51 primary and metastatic renal carcinomas, including three oncocytomas, were analyzed for point mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of the Ha-ras, Ki-ras and N-ras proto-oncogenes using polymerase-catalyzed chain reaction methodology. A mutated Ha-ras gene was found in one renal cancer metastatic to lung for an overall incidence of 2%. These data indicate that ras oncogenes, activated by point mutations, do not play a major role in the initiation, maintenance or metastases of renal carcinomas.\r"

Some argue that the HCFA's prediction model does not adequately account for patient severity. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the HCFA's model (replicated as closely as we could) to a second that added a severity measure (the Stage of Principal Diagnosis at Admission, a subscale of the Severity of Illness Index). In our simulation, the HCFA's model had very limited capacity to predict mortality (average R2, 2.5%). Patients grouped according to admission severity had markedly different mortality rates, which the HCFA's model's predictions could not differentiate. The HCFA model also failed to predict large differences in mortality between hospitals with low- and high-severity admissions. Adding severity to the HCFA's model yielded more than an eightfold increase in the R2, to 21.5%, and reduced instances of higher than expected hospital mortality to chance levels. These findings suggest that the HCFA's mortality release needs to be made much more sensitive to admission severity before it can be used to make valid inferences about the quality or effectiveness of hospital care.\r"

Seventy-eight percent (N = 195) responded. All hospitals, regardless of mortality rate, shared an extremely negative view of the accuracy, usefulness, and interpretability of the Health Care Financing Administration's mortality data. The lowest possible rating (poor) was given by 70% of the respondents on the question of usefulness of the data to the hospital, by 54% on accuracy of the data, and by 85% on usefulness of the data to consumers. Only 31% of the respondents said that they had used the data at all for internal purposes and 20% reported that the data release had caused problems for the hospital. Hospitals in the high-mortality group were more likely than others to report both use of the data and problems from its release. Publication of outcome data to encourage quality improvement may face severe and pervasive barriers in the attitudes and reactions of hospital leaders who are potential clients for such data.\r"

Recovery from the vegetative state does occur, but many persons in persistent vegetative states live for months or years if provided with nutritional and other supportive measures. The withdrawal of life support from these persons with loss of higher brain function is a controversial issue, as highlighted by public debates and judicial decisions.

Single-photon emission computed tomography has been applied to myocardial, skeletal, hepatic, and tumor scintigraphy, resulting in increased diagnostic accuracy over planar imaging because background activity and overlapping tissues interfere far less with activity from the target structure when tomographic techniques are used. Single-photon emission computed tomography is substantially less expensive and far more accessible than positron emission tomography and will become an increasingly attractive alternative for transferring the positron emission tomography technology to routine clinical use. In addition, single-photon emission computed tomography has unique applications that are increasingly finding their way into the routine practice of clinical nuclear medicine.\r"

A lectin, Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), was planted at the surface of rat GEN by the perfusion of the isolated left kidney with neuraminidase (NRD) and HPA. A subsequent perfusion with IgG fraction, but not with Fab fragments, of rabbit anti-HPA serum induced formation of granular immune deposits (IDs) on the surface of GEN. When the left kidney was revascularized after initial formation of IDs, acute glomerulonephritis ensued. Fifteen minutes after revascularization, granular IDs were observed at the subendothelial space. Two days later, there was decrease of subendothelial IDs with concomitant appearance of subepithelial IDs. At the seventh day, IDs were mainly localized in the subepithelial space. The results suggest that this model of experimental glomerulonephritis is characterized by: (1) initial formation of HPA immune complexes (ICs) at the surface of GEN; and by (2) subsequent movement of ICs from luminal side to subepithelial area with local formation of IDs. The results are relevant to the understanding of the kinetics of ICs resulting from interaction of antibodies with exogenous antigens \"planted\" in the glomerular capillary walls, and of the local formation of IDs.\r"

However, there is uncertainty in the literature regarding both the number of red blood cells (RBC) in normal urine, as well as the quantification of dysmorphism. We have shown that in normal urine (N = 27) the number of RBC is less than 2,000/ml as assessed by scanning electron microscopy of filtered urine specimens from normal volunteers without known renal disease, which compared to less than 1,000/ml by centrifugation and phase contrast microscopy of the same specimen. To determine whether dysmorphism of urinary red blood cells was a significant predictor of glomerular disease we compared the number of dysmorphic cells in the urine of patients with biopsy proven glomerulonephritis (GN), before and immediately after renal biopsy. We also compared the number of dysmorphic cells in patients with glomerulonephritis to those with lower urinary tract bleeding. Renal biopsy caused significant dysmorphic hematuria, indicating that dysmorphism suggests renal rather than glomerular bleeding. Although patients with GN had significantly more dysmorphic urinary RBC when compared to those with lower tract urinary bleeding, the overlap was such that one could only be confident of renal hematuria if they accounted for greater than 75% of the total number of RBC. Non renal hematuria is present if number of dysmorphic cells is less than 17% of total RBC. Thus dysmorphism of urinary RBC is a useful diagnostic tool, but only if strict criteria established for each laboratory are adhered to.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) reactive against complement components involved in the classical activation pathway were applied in an indirect immunoperoxidase technique for the histological study of normal and diseased human renal tissues. Prominent staining with antibodies against the C4d fragment was seen in all glomeruli and some renal arteriolar walls. The C4d staining was mesangial with light microscopy, whereas the subendothelial site of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) also appeared to be positive in immunoelectron microscopy. In similar localization, albeit with distinctly weaker intensity, IgM and C4 binding protein (C4bp) were detected. In kidney biopsies from patients with various types of glomerulonephritis, C4d reactive antibodies stained the glomerular structures in a strong, diffuse or granular pattern in contrast to the more segmental distribution and weaker staining intensity in normal kidney specimens. Increased amounts of C4d, occasionally also of C4b, were paralleled in diseased kidney tissues by distinct deposits of IgM and/or IgG in the presence of C4bp. This study suggests that the C4d fragment in normal human glomeruli is indicative of a continuous, local complement activation via the classical pathway induced by the physiological deposition of IgM-containing immune complexes.\r"

  ".W": "Leucocyte interaction with other cells is facilitated by the adhesion molecules, leucocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-binding to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and for T cells and natural killer (NK) cells the binding of LFA-2 (CD2) to LFA-3. As these interactions are critical for the mediation of graft destruction by effector T cells, we examined whether there was a change in the expression of these molecules during rejection compared to normal kidneys. In normal kidneys, peritubular and glomerular capillaries and large vessel endothelium expressed ICAM-1 and LFA-3, but tubular cells expressed only low levels of LFA-3. LFA-1-expressing cells, which were probably macrophages, were observed in the glomerulus. A few scattered LFA-1-expressing cells in the interstitium were probably tissue macrophages or dendritic cells, and only occasional interstitial mononuclear cells expressed LFA-2. During rejection, there was an infiltrate of mononuclear cells expressing LFA-1 and the T cell and NK cell component of the infiltrate expressed LFA-2. Neither of these markers was expressed by kidney parenchymal cells except for one allograft with severe rejection which showed LFA-1 beta chain expression by some tubular cells. Tubular cells had increased expression of ICAM-1 during rejection but there was no increase in LFA-3. The importance of LFA-2 and ICAM-1 expression on kidney tubular cells for adhesion of activated T cells was also examined in an in vitro system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Major features of a long-standing inflammation in the kidney are vascular proliferation, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, leading to a gradual deterioration of the renal function. In this study we have investigated the expression of B-type receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in frozen sections from normal and inflamed kidneys. Immunohistochemical techniques, employing two monoclonal antibodies specific for PDGF B-type receptors, were used. The specimens investigated were 15 kidneys removed by transplantectomy because of chronic rejection, 20 cases of glomerulonephritis with crescent formation, mesangial proliferation or non-proliferative glomerulonephritis, and six normal kidneys. In parallel we characterized cellular infiltrates and class II transplantation antigen expression in the inflamed kidneys. An enhanced PDGF receptor expression was found on intimal cells and on smooth muscle cells of the proliferating vessels, on glomerular cells in glomeruli with mesangial proliferation, and on fibroblast-like cells in the proximity of clusters of infiltrating macrophages and T-lymphocytes of the interstitial tissue. Induction of PDGF receptor expression may render cells responsive to stimulation by PDGF, released from PDGF-producing cells, such as activated macrophages and from platelets. Our data suggest that PDGF is involved in the proliferation of mesenchymal cells that is seen in rejected kidney transplants and glomerulonephritis.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the prognosis and the causative viral antigens of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated childhood membranous nephropathy (MN), the clinical course and glomerular HBV antigens were studied in 52 HBsAg carrier children with MN (40 boys, 12 girls). With Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies, hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) was detected in the glomerular deposits in 41 (95%) of 43 cases but HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in none. HBeAg was detected in sera from 43 (93%) of 46 children examined. These results suggest that HBeAg plays an important role in the development of MN in HBsAg carrier children. During the follow-up period (mean, 4 years), complete remission was found in 64% and 92% of the patients followed for one and seven years, respectively; only one child had mild renal function impairment. These findings suggest a favorable outcome of HBsAg-associated childhood MN. The patient's age, disease duration, amount of glomerular deposit, focal sclerosis and disease stage appeared to affect the clinical course. HBsAg seroconversion to HBsAg-negative occurred in seven cases, and all (100%) had quick remission in two years. In patients with persistent HBsAg carriage, serum HBeAg status alone did not correlate with remission rate and remission occurred usually before the HBeAg seroconversion to anti-HBe. These findings, together with the predominant horizontal infection in these children in contrast to the frequent vertical (perinatal) transmission from HBsAg carrier mothers in HBsAg carriers in Taiwan, suggest that factors other than HBeAg per se may also play important roles.\r"

  ".W": "During episodes of macroscopic hematuria, patients with IgA nephropathy commonly have polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) as well as fibrin and mononuclear cells in glomerular capillaries. We quantitated PMN and macrophage infiltration in glomeruli of 54 patients with IgA nephropathy in whom renal biopsies were obtained within 30 days of macroscopic hematuria. Control biopsies (N = 22) were from patients with IgA nephropathy and urinary erythrocyte counts below 50,000/ml. PMN monocyte/macrophages were quantitated using the monoclonal antibodies FMC10 and HAM56, respectively. In patients with heavy hematuria, 45.9 +/- 3.4% (mean +/- SE) of glomeruli were positive for PMNs (control 10.5 +/- 2.8%, P = 0.001) with a mean PMN count/glomerulus of 1.10 +/- 0.20 (control 0.13 +/- 0.03, P = less than 0.001). 65.6 +/- 9.7%. Of the glomeruli were positive for monocytes in the heavy hematuria group (control 40.0 +/- 8.4, P less than 0.05) with the mean monocyte count per glomerulus being 1.6 +/- 0.2 (control 0.6 +/- 0.1, P less than 0.01). We conclude that, in the acute phase of mesangial IgA nephropathy, PMN and monocytes are present and presumably participate in glomerular injury.\r"

All biopsies showed erythrocytes within tubules by light microscopy and, in five cases, there were morphologic features of acute tubular necrosis. In four biopsies there was clear evidence by electron microscopy of uptake of erythrocytes by renal tubular epithelial cells, associated with some blunting of epithelial microvilli, vacuolar change and increased lysosomal content. Associated with erythrophagocytosis, the subsequent pathway of erythrocyte destruction within renal tubular epithelial cells closely resembled the hemolytic pathway described in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight patients undergoing a cardiac operation randomly received either tranexamic acid, a potent inhibitor of plasminogen, or placebo in an effort to determine whether prophylactic antifibrinolytic therapy reduces chest tube drainage. Twelve-hour blood loss was 750 +/- 314 (standard deviation) ml in the placebo group and 496 +/- 228 ml in the drug group (p = 0.0057). Fibrin split products were present more frequently in patients in the placebo group (17 of 20 compared with four of 18 in the drug group; p = 0.0002). Tranexamic acid markedly decreased plasminogen availability (112 +/- 104 units in the placebo group versus 36 +/- 18 units in the drug group, p = 0.0058). Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were similar in the placebo and drug groups. Patients in the placebo group received more fresh-frozen plasma and more mediastinal shed blood than those in the drug group. No coagulation-related complication occurred in the group receiving tranexamic acid. We conclude that prophylactic tranexamic acid can be administered safely to inhibit fibrinolysis during cardiac operations, decrease postoperative bleeding, and possibly decrease the frequency of blood product transfusion.\r"
