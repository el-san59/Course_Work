  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that airway inflammation is linked to hyper-responsiveness of airway smooth muscle. Increases in airway responsiveness after many stimuli are accompanied by increases in inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in the airway epithelium. Airway epithelial cells may themselves be an important source of inflammatory mediators, producing metabolites that can cause chemotaxis of neutrophils and that can selectively activate other cells in the lungs. Mast cells produce a variety of enzymes and vasoactive, chemotactic, and bronchoconstrictor substances in response to non-immunologic as well as immunologic stimuli. The secretory profile of a mast cell may depend upon the specific stimulus applied. In addition, different populations of mast cells exist and distinct enzymatic pathways may predominate in different cell types. Mediators released by these cells may activate target cells by direct or indirect mechanisms. These inflammatory mediators, together with inflammatory cells, are important in the complex interactions involving airway epithelial cells, neutrophils, mast cells, smooth muscle, respiratory secretory cells, and nerves, which, in concert, are responsible for the pathophysiologic manifestations of obstructive lung disease.\r"

  ".W": "Airway mucociliary dysfunction leading to a depression of mucus transport has been demonstrated in patients with acute and chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchial asthma; use of bronchodilators that might further impair mucociliary function, therefore, generally has been discouraged. Atropine and ipratropium bromide are cholinergic antagonists that are effective bronchodilators in various clinical settings. Atropine has been shown to block the production of respiratory secretions in response to cholinergic stimulation, but to have no effect on baseline secretions. Atropine has also been clearly demonstrated to depress ciliary beat frequency and to slow airway mucociliary clearance, whereas the short-term and long-term administration of ipratropium bromide at higher than clinically recommended doses seems to lack these effects. No satisfactory explanation has thus far been offered for this difference between the two cholinergic antagonists. Nevertheless, with respect to airway mucociliary function, ipratropium bromide appears to be preferable to atropine in the treatment of obstructive airways disease.\r"

  ".U": "87073485\r", 
  ".W": "Mucus hypersecretion and non-continuous clearance of tracheobronchial mucus contribute to airflow obstruction in several pulmonary disease entities. Bronchospasm, which is frequently associated with bronchial asthma, can present simultaneously with mucus transport abnormalities. Therapy designed to dilate airways may produce secondary effects, which are deleterious to effective transport of lung mucus. Sympathomimetic agents, such as beta-adrenergic agonists, reduce the tone of bronchial smooth muscle and enhance the flow of mucus within lung airways. Parasympatholytic agents also improve airflow in the lungs, but their effects at the mucus membrane of the airways may not be beneficial. Atropine, an anticholinergic agent, apparently has dose-dependent effects on human mucociliary function and, administered orally, can reduce large airway mucus transport. However, newer anticholinergic agents, such as ipratropium bromide, are effective bronchodilators and do not exhibit unfavorable effects on lung mucus transport in either subjects with normal mucus secretion or those with hypersecretory disease entities, such as bronchitis. In mildly symptomatic asthmatic patients, aerosolized ipratropium decreased airway obstruction without consistent positive or negative influence on lung mucociliary function.\r"

The efficacy of ipratropium was assessed by its influence on airway constrictor responses to various bronchoprovocation stimuli; effects of medication on resting (pre-challenge) pulmonary functions were considered separately. The results indicate that administration of a single dose of ipratropium 30 to 90 minutes before challenge offers some protection against induced bronchospasm. However, in most instances, including challenge with histamine, allergen, or exercise, the protection is variable and incomplete; as expected, the anticholinergic drug provides better protection when the stimulus is methacholine. Most bronchoprovocation stimuli evoke mixed-airway responses with constriction of peripheral as well as central airways. The effects of ipratropium are exerted predominately on central airways. Other therapeutic agents, such as the beta agonists, with more influence on small, peripheral airways, offer greater protection than ipratropium on stimulus-induced bronchospasm.\r"

Most studies do not show a definite difference in responsiveness of atopic versus nonatopic asthmatic patients; there are, however, reports indicating a greater responsiveness to anticholinergic agents than to beta agonists in patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Ipratropium has been shown not to affect mucociliary clearance, sputum volume, or viscosity. It effectively inhibits the bronchial response to methacholine and, to a lesser degree, to histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and antigen. Protection against exercise-induced asthma with this drug has been variable, but ipratropium has been found particularly useful in psychogenic asthma. Its role in occupational asthma remains to be determined.\r"

Our results suggest that both drugs were equally effective bronchodilators.

No increase in side effects has been observed when ipratropium has been used in combination with other bronchodilating drugs.

  ".W": "Although primary neural control of airway function is through parasympathetic pathways, more recent evidence indicates that there are important adrenergic and non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neural mechanisms that may also influence respiratory function. The parasympathetic nervous system component includes neural receptors in the airways as well as afferent and efferent pathways that travel in the vagus nerves. Afferent vagal sensory receptors mediate the response to irritant or rapidly adapting receptor activation, Hering-Breuer, and the unmyelinated \"C\" fibers or \"J\" receptor pathways. The motor component of the parasympathetic nervous system has several important functions that regulate tone in normal system has several important functions that regulate tone in normal and obstructed airways. These pathways affect the following respiratory structures: bronchial smooth muscle; the mucociliary system; the larynx; and the nose. Finally, the parasympathetic nervous system may play a role in some species in the control of breathing and in the hyperpneic responses associated with airflow obstruction. In addition to cholinergic neural mechanisms, bronchomotor tone may also be influenced by adrenergic mechanisms and non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neural pathways. Although there is minimal innervation of the airways by the sympathetic nervous system, there is ample evidence that beta-adrenoreceptors are present on bronchial smooth muscle. Beta-receptor stimulation not only relaxes airway smooth muscle, but also inhibits mediator release from mast cells in the airways and may alter vascular permeability. Alpha-adrenoreceptors are found in human airways and stimulation of these receptors causes bronchoconstriction. Although the importance of alpha-adrenoreceptors has been questioned, recent evidence suggests that alpha stimulation may play a role in cold air- and exercise-induced asthma. Finally, non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerves have been shown to cause relaxation of human airways in in vivo studies. There is increasing evidence that vasoactive intestinal peptide and peptide histidine methanol are the mediators of these responses. More recently, other neuropeptides (substance P, neurokinin A, and calcitonin gene-related peptide) have been localized in nerves in airways. These cause bronchoconstriction in vitro and may be released from afferent nerve terminals by an axon reflex. Although the precise role of these substances in controlling airway tone and bronchial secretions in humans is not fully understood, they may have important modulatory effects on the neural control of airway function.\r"

The sensitivity and specificity for single and combinations of test results were evaluated in 50 appropriate for gestational age and 40 small for gestational age fetuses. Positive and negative predictive values were derived for the general population. Our results indicate that either a rate of growth of the fetal abdominal circumference less than or equal to 10 mm/14 days or a femur length/abdominal circumference ratio greater than or equal to 23.5 correctly identifies most small for gestational age fetuses. When the general population is screened, only 15% of small for gestational age fetuses will be missed by this combination of criteria. The presence of a pocket of amniotic fluid less than or equal to 2.0 cm is highly suggestive of a small for gestational age fetus. However, the presence of a pocket of amniotic fluid greater than 2.0 cm does not guarantee an appropriate for gestational age fetus. We conclude that these gestational age-independent indices of fetal growth offer useful tools for differentiating between the small for gestational age and appropriate for gestational age fetus.\r"

Our data reveal that the levels of inactive renin in both arterial and uterine venous blood of normal pregnant women are significantly higher than in peripheral venous blood of nonpregnant, normotensive control subjects; normotensive term patients have a ratio of plasma inactive to active renin of 9:1 in contrast to the 1:1 ratio in normotensive nonpregnant subjects; there is a significant uterine arteriovenous difference of prorenin (66.2 +/- 24.4 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.05) but not of active renin (1.8 +/- 1.5 ng/ml/hr, not significant). These results suggest that the uteroplacental unit contributes to the elevated prorenin levels at term pregnancy.\r"

Eight control subjects were matched for percent body fat and diet and studied in a similar fashion. Abnormalities of insulin response and insulin resistance were present in four (50%) of patients with previous gestational diabetes. Insulin resistance was significantly greater in the patients than in the control subjects. When compared with lean patients, obese patients with previous gestational diabetes had significantly greater insulin response to the intravenous glucose tolerance test and insulin resistance. These changes are consistent with reported findings of an early and progressive development of overt diabetes in patients who had gestational diabetes.\r"

There was no excessive intraocular inflammation or toxicity noted with either agent. Patients given sodium hyaluronate had a larger increase in intraocular pressure during the early postoperative period (2.04 mm Hg) than did those given hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (1.1 mm Hg), but the difference was not significant. Nine weeks after surgery, the mean (+/- SD) central endothelial cell loss was 4.84% (+/- 7.26%) in the 17 eyes with sodium hyaluronate and 4.37% (+/- 9.84%) in the 53 eyes with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.

Interleukin-1 was detected in Reed-Sternberg cells from 20 patients with Hodgkin's disease as well as in neoplastic cells from 9 patients with true histiocytic lymphoma or malignant histiocytosis. In the other 86 cases, which included T- and B-cell lymphomas, no interleukin-1 could be detected. This result indicates a close relationship between Hodgkin's disease and true histiocytic malignancies and provides additional evidence to support our hypothesis that Reed-Sternberg cells are related to interdigitating reticulum cells.\r"

The astrocytes in the CNS, the unmyelinated Schwann cells in the sciatic nerve, and the satellite cells in the trigeminal ganglion stained heavily with anti-GFAP antiserum. These changes in GFAP expression occurred shortly before the initiation of demyelination and coincided chronologically and topographically with infiltration of macrophages, suggesting that the same or closely related factors trigger the infiltration of macrophages and activate expression of GFAP. Cytoskeletal protein preparations showed increases in GFAP as well as in vimentin in the brainstem, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve. These results demonstrate that at least two types of peripheral glia (the unmyelinated Schwann cell and the satellite cell), in addition to the astrocyte, respond to some pathologic stimuli with an increased expression of GFAP. However, two other GFAP-positive structures, the Bergmann and radial glia, showed no significant changes in their immunostaining.\r"

Large accumulations of laminin associated with basement membranes were seen in thickened lung interstitial spaces by immunofluorescence microscopy, starting at 7 days (32-75% increases) and persisting through 28 days (66-79% increase). By electron microscopy, these laminin concentrations were skeinlike masses of reduplicated basement membranes localized at the surface of alveolar capillary endothelial cells. Numerous macrophages were also associated with this basement membrane material. These findings suggest that bleomycin-induced damage to lung cells causes massive local accumulations of basement membranes, which might be involved in the expansion of the interstitial stroma by stimulating attachment and activation of certain inflammatory cells.\r"

The authors detected neurophysins in the human corticotrophs and pituitary adenomas with the use of the immunohistochemical method with antiserum to human neurophysins, which did not cross-react with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin, and corticotropin-releasing factor. All of ten pituitary glands obtained by autopsy revealed the presence of neurophysin-positive cells in the anterior, intermediate, and the posterior lobes. The neurophysin-positive cells were similar to the corticotrophs in shape and distribution. Simultaneous staining for ACTH and neurophysins in the serial sections revealed that neurophysin-positive cells were also ACTH-positive. One hundred twenty-four cases of pituitary adenoma operated upon were investigated. All of 7 Cushing's adenomas were composed of neurophysin-positive cells. Six tumors with giantism showed sparsely distributed neurophysin-positive cells. No neurophysin-positive cells were observed in any other cases. This study is the first reported evidence of the presence of neurophysins in the human corticotrophs and pituitary adenomas.\r"

When localization was carried out by three different indirect immunogold methods (using ultrathin frozen sections, ultrathin sections cut from tissues embedded in Lowicryl K4M or LR White, or 20- mu cryostat sections for incubations), gold particles were found exclusively on the urinary surfaces of glomerular epithelial cells and, at a lower concentration, on the luminal surface of glomerular endothelial cells. No gold was bound to the basal surfaces (soles) of the epithelial foot processes, the filtration slit diaphragms, the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), or those regions of the endothelial plasmalemma that face the GBM. When podocalyxin was localized by an indirect immunoperoxidase method on cryostat sections, heavy deposits of reaction product were seen on the same cell surfaces as with the immunogold methods. Each of the methods used had certain advantages as well as limitations, but the collective results obtained were convergent and complimentary. It is concluded that podocalyxin is restricted in its distribution to the urinary surfaces of epithelial cells and the luminal surface of endothelial cells; it is missing or present in very low concentrations on the soles (basal surface) of the epithelial foot processes, the slit diaphragms and the basement membrane surface of the endothelium; and the podocalyxin-containing regions of the epithelial and endothelial plasmalemmae constitute microdomains of distinctive membrane protein composition on the corresponding cell surfaces.\r"

Some of the large islets contiguous to fibrous septa demonstrated variable degrees of obliterative sclerosis and reduction of islet cell mass, associated with evidence of remote peri- and intrainsular hemorrhage. In 3 rats, additional features included an active, proliferative replacement of islet substance by fibroblasts and histiocytes. These islet alterations are not characteristic of BB rats, nor have identical lesions been described in studies of experimental or human diabetes mellitus. Affected rats had sustained repetitive episodes of blood loss (from 15% to 28% of total blood volume each time) during the early phase of the study. It is possible, but not proved, that hypovolemic shock was induced in some of these animals. Ischemic necrosis of islets has been reported in premature and young infants succumbing to shock. It is posited that hypovolemic shock in the young animal may, as in the infant, result in islet cell ischemic necrosis, sufficient to produce, with time, the described islet morphologic features.\r"

The established treatment for the disorder is thiazide diuretics, which are associated with hypokalemia and reduced lithium excretion, predisposing the patient to lithium toxicity. Amiloride is a new diuretic that reduces lithium-induced polyuria in animals without affecting lithium or potassium levels. The authors found that 10-20 mg/day of amiloride given to eight patients who had become hypokalemic while being treated with hydrochlorothiazide for lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus increased renal concentrating ability and reduced polyuria. They conclude that amiloride can be useful in treating lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and merits future randomized clinical trials.\r"

  ".U": "87073927\r", 
  ".W": "This report encompasses the results of two studies on the relapse patterns of infections with the B strain of Plasmodium cynomolgi treated repetitively with chloroquine. One study of sizeable dimensions dealt primarily with relapses that occurred within 120 days of onset of patency in infections induced with inocula of 10(5) to 7 X 10(6) sporozoites. The second study, of more limited dimensions, dealt with relapses that occurred over a 689-day period after inoculation with 5 X 10(0) to 5 X 10(6) sporozoites. Both studies showed that with few exceptions relapses occurred at relatively regularly spaced intervals. The second study showed that frequency of relapse was related directly to the size of the sporozoite inoculum and inversely to the age of the infection; also that an inoculum larger than the minimum infective dose was required for relapse. Attempted correlation of these observations with the new and generally accepted hypnozoite concept of relapse uncovered two areas of serious incompatibility and numerous defects in the experimental base of this conceptualization. With limited provisos, the relapse patterns of infections with P. cynomolgi are fully compatible with the older cyclical development concept. The results of this study argue for caution in discarding this concept and for continuation of efforts to determine the genesis of the extended post-primary attack latent period that characterizes infections with the majority of strains of P. vivax.\r"

This method utilizes the ability of trophozoites which remain viable to replicate and multiply. In this study, the percent dead trophozoites after incubation in 20% fresh human serum was determined first by morphologic criteria and then by the ability of parasites to multiply in fresh medium over 48 hr. Using the number of parasites after 48 hr of growth, the original number of dead trophozoites in the serum-exposed samples was determined by extrapolation from a standard growth curve. Ten sera which killed from 7% to 89% of trophozoites by morphologic criteria, killed 8% to 92% using the culture method; these two assays for viability correlated highly (r = 0.96). Use of the culture assay allows the assessment of the lethal effects of serum and can be applied both to the study of other host defense mechanisms on Giardia trophozoites and to antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study a partially purified antigen preparation enriched in Fasciola-specific antigens (designated p3 and 4) was used in the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) to identify polypeptides which induce antibody formation in acute fascioliasis. The pattern of antigens recognized by the sera of infected rabbits, humans, and cows was also compared. Similar but not identical patterns of recognition were obtained for the different models tested; the main antigenic polypeptides recognized were in clusters within 27-38, 18-23, and 11-14 Kd molecular weight (Mr) ranges. An antigen of 31-33 Kd was one of the most prominently recognized by all of the acute infection sera tested. This antigen, as well as those in the 18-23 Kd range, appear to have good specificity, as they are not recognized by antibodies to S. mansoni or P. westermani adult worm extracts. To further characterize and evaluate these low Mr antigens, we have isolated polypeptides by electrophoresing p3 and 4 F. hepatica antigens in 10%-15% gradient gels, identifying the desired Mr range with prestained markers, cutting individual gel strips, and then isolating them by electroelution. Antigen fractions of 19-23 and 31-33 Kd were isolated in this manner, re-electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose and found to be reactive with the sera from a rabbit with acute fascioliasis. At least one of these antigens, of 20 Kd Mr, has been obtained by this means with a high degree of purity. This, as well as other antigen fractions isolated, showed high absorbance values in ELISA when reacted with the serum from a rabbit with an 8-week-old F. hepatica infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Three monospecific antivenoms for Malayan pit viper (MPV) (Calloselasma rhodostoma) were compared in Southern Thailand, where this species is the most common cause of snake bite morbidity. Forty-six patients with proved MPV bites and incoagulable blood, indicating systemic envenoming, were randomly allocated for treatment with Thai Red Cross (TRC), Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), or Twyford Pharmaceutical monospecific antivenoms. Both GPO and Twyford antivenoms produced rapid and permanent restoration of blood coagulability, but TRC antivenom failed in 2/15 cases. Patients in the GPO group showed the greatest increase in plasma fibrinogen concentration during the first 24 hr and had fewer early anaphylactic reactions (6/15) compared with Twyford 8/16 and with TRC 13/15. Pyrogenic reactions occurred more frequently after TRC antivenom (8/15) than GPO (1/15) or Twyford (0/16). Patients requiring more than one dose of antivenom were identifiably more severely envenomed on admission. In an accompanying laboratory study the antivenoms were assessed in rodents using five WHO standard tests of neutralizing activity. Compared with the other two antivenoms TRC was significantly inferior in anti-lethal potency, GPO was superior in anti-hemorrhagic and anti-necrotic potency and Twyford was superior in anti-procoagulant and anti-defibrinogenating potency. The clinical efficacy of these antivenoms against local necrosis remains equivocal. GPO and Twyford antivenoms are recommended for the treatment of systemic envenoming by MPV in an initial dose of 5 ampoules.\r"

Fatal septic episodes were not due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, but did occur significantly more often in the splenectomy group (22 percent versus 7 percent, p less than 0.05). Although the location of infection was similar, there was a significant difference in the number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in the patients who had undergone splenectomy (p less than 0.05). Consideration must be given to the significantly increased risk of postoperative infectious morbidity in patients with chronic leukemia when evaluating the usefulness of splenectomy.\r"

Chronic recurrent abdominal pain in children continues to be common. To help evaluate the possibility that such pain is related to chronic recurrent pancreatitis, this study used the morphine-prostigmine pancreatic evocative test with the recent addition of concomitant pancreatic ultrasonography to evaluate ductal activity. Fourteen of 67 children studied had positive results and 13 underwent operation, which included 2 partial pancreatectomies and 12 sphincteroplasties in 12 patients. At last follow-up seven were asymptomatic, five were significantly improved, and one who had pancreatography only continued to have pain. The remaining patient, who has not yet operated on, continues to have pain. This series supports the use of the morphine-prostigmine test to determine which patients have abdominal pain that is potentially related to pancreatitis and which patients would benefit from operation.\r"

  ".W": "Positive end-expiratory pressure is helpful in avoiding hypoxemia but can cause barotrauma to the lungs and heart. Reducing positive end-expiratory pressure as quickly as possible without sacrificing oxygenation is desirable. Weaning from positive end-expiratory pressure is an integral part of removing mechanical ventilation, but the selection of patients for positive end-expiratory pressure reduction and appropriate monitoring after this has not been established. We prospectively studied 29 positive end-expiratory pressure weaning trials to document oxygenation changes. Patients had stable vital signs and were not septic. All were receiving inspired oxygen concentrations of 50 percent or less and 5 to 12 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure. Positive end-expiratory pressure was decreased by 2 cm H2O increments. Arterial blood gas levels were monitored at 1, 3, 5, and 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after positive end-expiratory pressure reduction. Positive end-expiratory pressure reduction was successful if the partial pressure of oxygen value did not decrease below 65 mm Hg. Patients were successfully weaned from positive end-expiratory pressure in 27 of 29 trials (93 percent). The partial pressure of oxygen nadir occurred at 30 minutes. In successful trials, the partial pressure of oxygen value decreased an average of 12 mm Hg, an average change of -8 percent from the baseline partial pressure of oxygen value. This returned to baseline within 6 hours in only 13 patients (48 percent). The two patients in whom weaning failed had clinical signs of hypoxemia at 30 minutes. Their changes in partial pressure of oxygen at 30 minutes averaged -44 mm Hg (a 41 percent decrease). These data outline an approach to positive end-expiratory pressure weaning which is easy and practical. It supports oxygenation with the least physiologic embarrassment to the patient. In our patients it was 100 percent predictive of success.\r"

  ".W": "Since elective and emergent nontransplant-related surgical procedures are frequently necessary in renal allograft recipients, it becomes essential to determine the incidence and outcome of these operations in this population. For this reason, a retrospective analysis of 273 consecutive renal transplants performed in 254 patients between January 1978 and November 1985 was accomplished. During this interval, 139 patients underwent 162 nontransplant-related surgical procedures. In the 44 patients who underwent 55 emergent or semiemergent procedures, 8 patients (18 percent) died in the postoperative period. All deaths occurred in patients who underwent major abdominal or thoracic procedures for perforated viscera, gastrointestinal bleeding, or empyema and lung abscess, and all deaths were secondary to sepsis and multiple organ failure. In the survivors of emergent procedures, the mean preoperative and discharge serum creatinine levels were 2.87 mg/dl and 2.82 mg/dl, respectively. In the 95 patients who underwent 107 elective procedures, most of which were performed under general anesthesia, the operative mortality was 4.2 percent. In patients with stable renal allograft function at the time of operation, mean serum creatinine levels preoperatively and at the time of discharge were not significantly different (1.74 mg/dl versus 1.64 mg/dl). In conclusion, emergent operative procedures for intraabdominal or thoracic catastrophes are associated with a high mortality rate in renal allograft recipients. On the other hand, elective surgical procedures can be undertaken with an acceptable mortality rate and no adverse affects on graft function. Of utmost importance in these patients is the close monitoring of the immunosuppressive regimen and the early detection and treatment of potential septic complications.\r"

A low value of mean flow velocity was not itself a reliable prognostic indicator of bypass failure.

A single dose of the beta 2-agonist terbutaline (5 mg) and the beta 1 + 2-agonist orciprenaline (10 mg) did not reduce the fall in systolic pressure on standing up, despite a significant increase in both supine and standing heart rates. The beta 1-antagonist with intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity (ISA) acebutolol (200 mg) and the beta 1-antagonist metoprolol (50 mg) did not influence the fall in systolic pressure either, despite a significant decrease in supine and standing heart rates and disappearance of increase in heart rate on standing up. Only the beta 1 + 2-antagonist propranolol and the beta 1 + 2-antagonist with ISA pindolol (5 mg) could significantly reduce or practically abolish the fall in systolic and diastolic pressure on standing up. This was accompanied by a slight decrease of heart rates and disappearance of difference between supine and standing heart rates, as seen with the other beta-antagonists. Thus, only beta 2-blockade reduced or abolished the fall in systolic pressure on standing up in our patients. These data were confirmed by a three-week crossover trial in 10 of these patients.\r"

In order to study smoke inhalation injury, we developed a synthetic smoke composed of a carrier of hot carbon particles of known size to which a single known common toxic agent in smoke, in this case HCI, could be added. We then exposed rats to the smoke, assayed their blood for the metabolites of thromboxane and prostacyclin, and intervened shortly after smoke with the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin or ibuprofen to see if the resulting lung injury could be prevented. Smoke exposure produced mild pulmonary edema after 6 h with a wet-to-dry weight ratio of 5.6 +/- 0.2 SEM (n = 11) compared with the non-smoke-exposed control animals with a wet-to-dry weight ratio of 4.3 +/- 0.2 (n = 12), p less than 0.001. Thromboxane B, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha rose to 1,660 +/- 250 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) and to 600 +/- 100 pg/ml (p greater than 0.1), respectively, in the smoke-injured animals compared with 770 +/- 150 pg/ml and 400 +/- 100 pg/ml in the non-smoke-exposed control animals. Indomethacin (n = 11) blocked the increase in both thromboxane and prostacyclin metabolites but failed to prevent lung edema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was a trend for peak expiratory flow rates to normalize more quickly in monitored patients, and their mean duration of hospital stay was shorter (6.3 versus 8.7 days, p = 0.029). Two patients in the control group died; both had theophylline concentrations above 25 micrograms/ml and clinical toxicity. No serious side effects were observed in the monitored group. With pharmacokinetic individualization of theophylline dosage, more patients achieved serum concentrations in the therapeutic range, and there was a tendency for more rapid clinical improvement.\r"

Neural control of human airways is more complex than previously recognized. In addition to afferent nerves and cholinergic adrenergic mechanisms (including circulating catecholamines), there are nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves that may be both excitatory and inhibitory. The neurotransmitters of this third nervous system are uncertain, but there is some evidence that neuropeptides may be involved. Several neuropeptides have recently been identified in human airways and, although they have potent effects, their pathophysiologic role is uncertain. There is much evidence that autonomic control of the airways may be abnormal in airway disease, particularly in asthma, but the precise role of neural mechanisms in the pathogenesis of air-flow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness remains to be defined.\r"

Measurements of tidal volume, end-tidal PCO2, arterial PCO2, oxygen consumption, physiologic dead space to tidal volume ratio, diaphragm length, and thoracic and abdominal dimensions were made at values of CPAP from 0 to 20 cm H2O during periods of diaphragm pacing. Total respiratory compliance (TRC) was measured during controlled ventilation with incremental positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 0 to 20 cm H2O. A significant negative correlation was found between increasing CPAP and generated tidal volumes. This correlation was seen to occur even when TRC was constant at degrees of CPAP from 0 to 7.5 cm H2O. When phrenic nerve stimulation was commenced, oxygen consumption rose significantly from values obtained during controlled ventilation, but there was no significant correlation between changes in CPAP and the rise in oxygen consumption. Using inductance methods, thoracic and abdominal diameters were seen to rise as CPAP was increased. As suggested by the decrease in the length of the vertical and horizontal portions of the diaphragm in the chest roentgenogram, the conformation of the diaphragm also changed. It is suggested that the operating length and conformation of the diaphragm are principal factors affecting tidal volume generation during electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves.\r"

Gram-negative infections were documented in 13 of the 33 patients receiving placebo, but only in 4 of the 35 patients receiving norfloxacin; no effect on the frequency of gram-positive or fungal infections was noted. Norfloxacin administration resulted in the suppression of gastrointestinal tract colonization by aerobic bacteria without the development of norfloxacin resistance. Patients receiving norfloxacin developed first infectious fevers later than did those receiving placebo, had more rapid resolution of that fever after systemic antibiotic treatment, and spent less time febrile. Therefore, although no difference was seen in survival duration, we found that the prophylactic administration of oral norfloxacin led to decreases in overall morbidity and gram-negative infections, was well tolerated, and did not predispose to the development of multiply drug-resistant bacteria.\r"

The data show a spectrum of clinical and histologic changes that represent different stages in the evolution of the inflammatory process.\r"

Both symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection (21% compared with 46%, p = 0.03) and interstitial pneumonia (18% compared with 46%, p = 0.02) occurred less frequently in the recipients of intravenous immune globulin than in control patients. Prophylactic intravenous immune globulin was also associated with a lower incidence of graft-versus-host disease (34% in recipients compared with 65% in controls, p = 0.01), but its reduction in rates of interstitial pneumonia was independent of graft-versus-host disease and occurred in both patients with and without graft-versus-host disease. The high doses of immune globulin were well tolerated. Prophylactic intravenous immune globulin can modify the severity of cytomegalovirus infection and prevent interstitial pneumonia and possibly graft-versus-host disease in patients having allogeneic marrow transplantation.\r"

We report an examination of 20 additional health status measures. Our results are consistent with a hypothesis of no differences in health status measures between the two systems. In addition, a comparison of nine health practices between the systems also indicated no overall differences. Most physiologic measures and health practices for a typical person were not affected by care received through the fee-for-service system or the HMO. However, we are less certain of this result in specific subgroups, such as persons of lower income initially at elevated risk, because confidence intervals are necessarily wider. We conclude that the cost savings achieved by this HMO through lower hospitalization rates were not reflected in lower levels of health status.\r"

A review of past HMO performance suggests that, although these organizations will try to effect a decrease in the rate and duration of hospitalization to control costs, a high rate of functional disability and acute illness in elderly patients will make it impossible to accomplish this significantly. Also, although HMOs will attempt to provide more comprehensive coverage, the demand for prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and medical devices will make such coverage very expensive. Attempts to ration the services of primary-care physicians will impede case management and continuity of care. If HMOs are to provide high-quality medical care at a reasonable cost, they will need to consider making use of geriatric assessment units, geriatric consultants, geriatric nurse practitioners, and special geriatric hospital wards.\r"

These tests are not useful for hospitalized patients, unless an abnormality is suspected or surgery with major blood loss is anticipated. It is appropriate to obtain the tests when a hematologic or infectious disorder is suspected, but they may not affect decision making if the diagnosis is clinically evident. The leukocyte differential count is unnecessary to confirm an infection in most cases in which leukocytosis is present. Repeat tests should be limited to situations where the clinical course is unclear, and at intervals long enough such that the results might affect clinical decision making.\r"

Adrenal causes include Cushing's disease, adrenal tumors, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Ovarian causes include tumors, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and most cases of idiopathic hirsutism. The clinical evaluation is designed to differentiate between these diagnostic possibilities. When an underlying abnormality can be identified, such as an ovarian tumor, the treatment course is clear. When the diagnosis is idiopathic hirsutism, however, the best treatment is uncertain and several available regimens are possible.\r"

An alternative method of reconstruction is the open technique, which requires three stages. The initial stage creates a trough after resection of the stenotic area, followed by subcutaneous embedding of a rigid material adjacent to the trough, and finally closure of the trough by reformation of the anterior wall. This staged procedure has been used in adult patients with tracheal stenoses greater than 4 cm, in patients with tracheal stenoses involving the cricoid, and in patients whose primary corrective operative procedures have failed. This paper critically assesses 30 patients who have had a staged reconstruction with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. The indications, number of procedures performed, time required for decannulation, complications, and analysis of failures are presented. The incidence of success in this series of patients is 76% (23/30).\r"

All but four individuals were men, with an average age at diagnosis of 64 years. An immunoperoxidase technique showed that 20 specimens from 14 patients contained detectable HPV capsid antigen. An independent evaluation for histopathologic features characteristic of HPV infection identified viral changes in the 14 patients as well as an additional two. No correlation was found between clinical course, as determined by histologic severity of vocal cord lesions, and presence of HPV.

  ".W": "Two principal features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are (1) the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques, and (2) the loss of cortical cholinergic activity because of dysfunction of neurons in the basal forebrain cholinergic system. The relationship of these two abnormalities is an unresolved issue in the pathology of AD. We used polyclonal antibodies specific for paired helical filaments (PHFs), combined with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry, to assess the cytoskeletal changes of cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain in AD. In both sporadic and familial AD, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) showed a marked decrease in AChE-positive (AChE+) perikarya and abundant immunoreactive NFTs. In double-labeling studies of the nbM, PHF reactivity was found both in surviving AChE+ neurons and in many AChE- NFTs that were not associated with microscopically recognizable cell structures. Some surviving AChE+ perikarya did not contain NFTs. Numerous NFTs and senile plaques were identified by PHF immunoreactivity in other basal forebrain areas, including subnuclei of the amygdala that showed low or absent AChE activity. We conclude that the dysfunction and death of cholinergic neurons in the nbM is associated with extensive NFT formation, including apparently residual NFTs in loci where nbM neurons once existed; and many noncholinergic neurons and neurites in the basal forebrain show NFT and senile plaque formation. The cytopathology of AD involves neurons of varying transmitter specificities, including cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptides are widely distributed in the central nervous system, where they serve as neuroregulators. Recent interest has focused on their role in degenerative neurological diseases. We describe the normal anatomy of neuropeptides in both the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia as a framework for interpreting neuropeptide alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Concentrations of cortical somatostatin are reduced in AD and in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Concentrations of neuropeptide Y and corticotropin-releasing factor are also reduced in AD cerebral cortex. The reduced cortical concentrations of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y in AD cerebral cortex may reflect a loss of neurons or terminals in which these two peptides are co-localized. In Huntington's disease, basal ganglia neurons in which somatostatin and neuropeptide Y are co-localized are selectively preserved. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of neuropeptides in AD reflect alterations in cortical concentrations. Improved understanding of neuropeptides in degenerative neurological illnesses will help define which neuronal populations are specifically vulnerable to the pathological processes, and this could lead to improved therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We have undertaken to increase the proliferative capacity of cultured human skeletal myocytes by transfection with a plasmid construct that contains the immortalizing and transforming large T antigen gene of simian virus 40 (SV40) under the control of a zinc-sensitive metallothionein promoter. This construct was chosen to permit rapid growth of transformants in zinc-containing medium, which induces high levels of T antigen expression, and muscle-specific differentiation after withdrawal of exogenous zinc, which reduces levels of T antigen. When grown in 100 microM Zn2+, transformed myocytes expressed the large T antigen, divided rapidly, and acquired an apparently unlimited proliferative capacity. Transfer of these cells to a zinc-poor medium resulted in decreased T antigen immunofluorescence, growth rate, and saturation density as well as a return to a physiological spindle morphology. Despite transformation, these cells expressed differentiation markers characteristic of myoblasts: the B isoform of creatine kinase, and surface antigens 5.1H11, D5, and Thy 1 in the presence or absence of Zn2+. When grown to high density in a serum-poor medium, these cells differentiated further into typical multinucleated myotubes that expressed the M isoform of creatine kinase and increased levels of surface antigen 5.1H11, creatine kinase, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, but no detectable Thy 1 antigen. The specific activity of these differentiation markers was higher when the cells were grown in the absence of added zinc. These results indicate that transformation of human skeletal myocytes with a regulatable SV40 large T antigen gene allows an increase of the proliferative capacity of these cells with preservation of their capacity to differentiate in a physiological manner.\r"

Extrapyramidal muscular rigidity, myoclonus, and characteristic periodic electroencephalographic (EEG) complexes were observed comparatively late in the illness, and some type of involuntary movement or periodic EEG activity was seen in over 95% of the patients.

Most patients with neoplastic CNS involvement showed a high proportion of CSF B cells (OKB2+ and/or OKB7+) and a concurrently low proportion of CSF T cells (anti-Leu 1+). Proliferating cells expressing transferrin receptor (OKT9 labeled) were increased in the CSF of 2 patients with neoplastic CNS involvement. In 2 patients with infectious CNS complications, the cell distribution in CSF did not differ from that in patients with aseptic meningitis. Patients with leukemia who had no CNS symptoms, and also 1 patient with meningitis and blood-brain barrier damage, showed a normal cell distribution in CSF despite high B-cell numbers in the peripheral blood.

The in vivo efficacy of ciprofloxacin, a new carboxy-quinolone, was evaluated in experimental aortic valve endocarditis caused by a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is stably derepressed for beta-lactamase production and is resistant to ceftazidime and multiple other beta-lactam agents. A total of 51 catheterized rabbits with aortic catheters in place were infected with this strain and then received no therapy (controls), ceftazidime (75 mg/kg per day), or ciprofloxacin (80 mg/kg per day). Ciprofloxacin sterilized all blood cultures and significantly lowered vegetation densities of P. aeruginosa by day 2 of treatment versus controls (P less than 0.0005) and animals receiving ceftazidime (P less than 0.0005). This beneficial effect of ciprofloxacin was also noted on therapy days 6 and 11. Ciprofloxacin rendered most vegetations (85%) culture negative over the 11-day treatment period and achieved bacteriologic cure in 73% of animals (P less than 0.0005 versus other therapy groups). Ciprofloxacin prevented bacteriologic relapse at 6 days posttherapy. No ciprofloxacin resistance was detected among Pseudomonas isolates from cardiac vegetations. Ciprofloxacin warrants further evaluation in vivo versus multi-drug-resistant gram-negative bacillary infections.\r"

Bacterial suspensions from agar plates were incubated separately with each beta-lactam substrate for 1 h at 37 degrees C. The supernatant of the reaction mixture was dansylated, and the dansyl derivatives were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyamide sheets. The end products resulting from acylase hydrolysis, including the intact beta-lactam nucleus, 6-aminopenicillanic acid or 7-aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid, and the acyl side chain acid, D-(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetic acid, and the end product resulting from beta-lactamase hydrolysis (D-phenylglycylpenicilloic acid or D-phenylglycyldeacetoxycephalosporoic acid) were separated from each unhydrolyzed substrate and amino acids by this procedure. The presence of the intact beta-lactam nucleus in the reaction mixture is the indication of acylase activity. This method is sensitive and reproducible and has been successfully applied to screening for acylase activity in a variety of bacteria. It may be pharmaceutically useful for identifying organisms capable of removing the acyl side chain from naturally occurring beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, penicillin V, and cephalosporin C for production of the beta-lactam nuclei which serve as the starting materials for semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotics.\r"

Penicillin G susceptibility for S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus hominis was readily determined by using beta-lactamase tests with induced cells and with a standardized microdilution test. MIC criteria for susceptibility used for S. aureus were applicable to the coagulase-negative species. Percentages of organisms susceptible were as follows: S. epidermidis, 7%; S. haemolyticus, 5%; and S. hominis, 47%. Oxacillin susceptibility for these four species was readily determined by using a modification of the microdilution test. MIC criteria for susceptibility used for S. aureus were applicable to S. haemolyticus and S. hominis, but alternate criteria were necessary for S. epidermidis. Percentages of organisms susceptible were as follows: S. epidermidis, 29%; S. haemolyticus, 36%; and S. hominis, 97%. Staphylococcus saprophyticus differed from the other staphylococcal species; all strains were beta-lactamase negative and were penicillin susceptible but had higher penicillin G MICs than did susceptible strains of the other species. There was total cross resistance among the penicillinase-resistant penicillins and cephalothin for the coagulase-negative staphylococci as well as for S. aureus; oxacillin MICs were more reliable than MICs of the other drugs or a standardized disk diffusion test for distinguishing resistant from susceptible strains. Vancomycin, rifampin, and ciprofloxacin were consistently active against all staphylococci. Erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were more active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci than against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.\r"

  ".U": "87074776\r", 
  ".W": "There are several major differences between the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of highly penicillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of pneumococci. The highest-molecular-size PBP 1a (98 kilodaltons [kDa]) of susceptible pneumococci is not detectable in resistant bacteria. Instead, resistant strains contain a PBP of smaller size: 92 and 94 kDa in South African strains 8249 and A95210, respectively, and 96 kDa in New Guinea strain 2955 (S. Zighelboim and A. Tomasz, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 17:434-442, 1980). Using antibodies prepared against PBP 1a of penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, we demonstrated that these anomalous-sized proteins in the resistant strains are immunologically related to PBP 1a of penicillin-susceptible bacteria. A second difference between the PBP patterns of strain 8249 and the susceptible pneumococci is that the 78-kDa PBP 2b is not detectable by the radioactive penicillin binding assay in the resistant strain. Using antibodies prepared against PBP 2b of susceptible cells, we demonstrated the presence of PBP 2b in membrane preparations from strain 8249 cells. Thus, the poor detection of this PBP appears to be related to its greatly decreased affinity for the antibiotic molecule. We also compared the patterns of penicillin-labeled peptides derived from PBPs of resistant and susceptible cells during partial proteolysis by V8 protease. Several changes were observable in small peptides carrying the beta-lactam binding site generated from the high Mr (PBP 1a-related) binding proteins. In contrast, no differences in the pattern of penicillin-labeled peptides were seen when the pattern of PBP 2a of susceptible pneumococci was compared with the peptide pattern of PBP 2a from resistant strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an approach to understanding the origin of methicillin resistance in clinical isolates of staphylococci, a series of Staphylococcus aureus mutants resistant to various beta-lactam antibiotics were isolated in the laboratory by antibiotic selection. Mutants with low- and intermediate-level resistance showed considerable specificity for the particular antibiotic used in the selection process (methicillin, cefotaxime, cephalexin, and amdinocillin), and resistance in such mutants also showed alterations in the antibiotic binding capacities of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). In each case the isolation of mutants resistant to high concentrations of antibiotics required sequential passage in gradually increasing concentrations of the drug. The acquisition of increasing levels of methicillin resistance was paralleled by a gradual decrease in the binding capacities of PBPs 2, 3, and, possibly, 1. In a highly methicillin-resistant mutant (MIC, 150 micrograms/ml), PBPs 2 and 3 were no longer detectable by the penicillin binding assay. Instead, a new PBP of poor binding capacity and anomalous molecular size (about 78 kilodaltons [kDa]) appeared in these cells. This corresponds to the molecular size of PBP 2a, the unique PBP that appears to be the biochemical correlate of resistance in clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Also, similar to the case of resistant clinical isolates, high-level beta-lactam resistance was highly pH dependent in the laboratory mutants. We compared the patterns of radioactive peptides generated by partial proteolysis from the penicillin-labeled PBP 2 of antibiotic-susceptible staphylococci and from the 78-kDa PBP 2a of a resistant clinical strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fluid intake was not restricted. There was a significant reduction in the number of wet nights. Seven children (41%) were cured or showed considerable improvement, with strong evidence against any placebo effect. The best response was seen in children aged 10 years or over and if urine osmolality after DDAVP reached beyond 1000 mmol/kg or was already at this concentration. The degree of overnight rise in urine osmolality after treatment with DDAVP was not predictable but correlated well with the clinical improvement in nocturnal diuresis present in eight of the children. A further 12 children with equally refractory enuresis were given 20 micrograms of the active drug to take during their school journeys or holidays. Six of them had previously normal overnight urine osmolalities with only two successes, but of the six who had nocturnal diuresis before treatment, five became dry, suggesting that DDAVP acts largely by anti-diuresis and might be most useful in children with nocturnal polyuria.\r"

  ".W": "Extension of Wilms' tumor through the inferior vena cava into the heart presents a formidable clinical challenge. Excision of such a tumor without provoking emobilization may require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The completeness of excision and the likelihood of tumor embolization during operation guide subsequent radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy. To help define these issues, the clinical records of 15 patients enrolled in three National Wilms' Tumor Studies (NWTS) who had intracardiac tumor extension (ICE) were reviewed. The median age at diagnosis was 4 years. One patient had clear cell sarcoma (CCS); the remainder had favorable histologic findings (FH). The clinicopathologic stage was stage II in one patient, stage III in eight patients, and stage IV in six patients. ICE was detected before operation in six patients, during operation in five patients, and after operation in five patients. CPB was used in 10 patients. Eleven patients (73%) had operative complications, with major intraoperative hemorrhage occurring most often (six patients). Complications occurred less often when ICE was recognized before operation (three of six patients) than when it was not (eight of nine patients). Embolization occurred in only two patients. There were no operative deaths. The patient with CCS died. Eleven of 14 patients with FH survived, with an actuarial event-free, 2-year survival rate of 86%. There were no patients in the first NWTS. Of the six patients in the second NWTS (NWTS-2), four died (67%). All nine patients in the third NWTS (NWTS-3) survived, but follow-up was shorter (median 4 years 9 months vs. 2 years 7 months). No particular surgical procedure was associated with an increased death rate. This review suggests Wilms' tumor with ICE presents a formidable surgical undertaking but has a relatively good prognosis. Embolization is an uncommon event in ICE (two patients, 13.3%), allowing a planned operative approach. Echocardiography and ultrasonography provide accurate preoperative diagnosis. And ICE should be suspected in patients with extensive vena cava thrombosis or who have hypotension or heart failure during examination or surgery.\r"

Fifteen cats underwent forty operative procedures. Following intra-abdominal heterotopic heart transplantation, serial laparotomies were performed in the early (days 0 to 2), intermediate (days 5 to 7), and late (days 7 to 16) postoperative periods. Rejection was assessed by serial clinical examinations, ECG analyses, B-mode echocardiography, histological and ultrastructural analyses, and measurements of interstitial myocardial pH. Intramyocardial pH was measured by a new miniature (0.6 X 3.0 mm) fiberoptic pH transducer. At confirmed rejection, concomitant laparotomy and thoracotomy were performed and pH sensors were implanted in both native (anatomical) and graft hearts. Nine animals at rejection were given methylprednisolone and changes in graft and native heart pH were measured. The pH during absence of rejection, mild acute rejection, and severe acute rejection averaged 7.430 +/- 0.019, 7.233 +/- 0.040 (p less than .02), and 6.860 +/- 0.066 (p less than .02), respectively (mean +/- standard error of the mean). A progressive decline in pH was noted in each heart. In animals receiving steroids, graft heart pH increased over 90 minutes from 6.852 +/- 0.065 to 7.043 +/- 0.077 (p less than .05). Although pH decline may be secondary to either inflammatory or ischemic etiology, histological and ultrastructural analyses demonstrate a predominant inflammatory response with progressive mononuclear cell infiltration, interstitial edema, vascular wall edema, infiltration by polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes, vacuolation of sarcoplasmic reticulum, and disarray of myocytes associated with falling pH. Degree of pH change correlated closely with degree of histological rejection, presence of ECG voltage decline, and change in wall thickness by ultrasound.\r"

Our experience with the IMA started with single attached grafts. To reduce injury to the pedicle and improve anastomotic accuracy, magnification, microsurgical techniques, and cardioplegia were introduced. After establishing excellent long-term patency of the IMA and knowing of the high incidence of obstruction in saphenous vein grafts 7 to 10 years after operation, we hypothesized that multiple IMA coronary anastomoses could improve the long-term results of coronary artery bypass grafting. Bilateral IMA, sequential IMA, and IMA Y-grafts were used to increase the number of mammary coronary anastomoses to 3.1 per patient. Early clinical results and patency evaluations are encouraging. In our experience, the IMA has evolved from being implanted into the myocardium, to a single bypass graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery, and finally to being the bypass conduit of choice supplying blood to three or more obstructed coronary arteries or their branches.\r"

Reports of 1,483 patients subjected to staged or concomitant carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting reveal a perioperative stroke rate of 2.9%. Timing of carotid endarterectomy did not influence stroke rate, but staged procedures were associated with a significantly greater incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction and death. Studies of patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgical operations without prophylactic carotid endarterectomy reported a perioperative stroke rate of 2.7%, which is not significantly different from that of patients undergoing prophylactic carotid endarterectomy. However, the author's prospective study of such patients showed a significant incidence of late postoperative neurologic deficits, which are usually transient ischemic attacks. There is no evidence to justify routine prophylactic carotid endarterectomy of asymptomatic carotid disease before major cardiovascular operations. Patients not undergoing endarterectomy, however, should be given careful postoperative follow-up, because transient ischemic attacks may occur that require surgical intervention.\r"

Anticoagulation is the preferred treatment for thromboembolic disease because it prevents lethal pulmonary embolism and also arrests the underlying thrombotic process. However, in specific patients with documented pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis, or who are at high risk that either of these will develop, anticoagulation therapy may be contraindicated, may fail to control the thrombotic process, or may offer inadequate protection from lethal pulmonary embolism. In these instances, or when a previous mechanical attempt has failed to prevent pulmonary embolism from a caval source, a Greenfield filter should be considered. The available information on the natural history of patients in these specific categories and subcategories is reviewed, and the indications for and timing of Greenfield filter placement are explained.\r"

A broad band of end-plates was found at the midpoint of the muscle fibers in the superior and middle aspect of the muscle. This band divided obliquely in a lateral direction toward the inferior border of the muscle. This pattern of motor end-plate distribution is possibly consistent with the bilateral innervation of the IA by the recurrent laryngeal nerves.\r"

Complications with these materials are commonplace. Autogenous bone has been used with good results and avoids many of the problems inherent to the use of foreign materials. Rib, scapula, and iliac crest may be used, but they require a separate incision and often provide less than satisfactory cosmetic results. We describe a technique of cranioplasty utilizing split calvarium for repair of frontal bone defects. Cosmesis is excellent, morbidity is minimal, and only one incision is necessary.\r"

Two hundred and sixty four patients were allocated to conventional treatment and 269 patients to thrombolysis. At the end of the procedure patency of the infarct related vessel was achieved in 198 (85%) of 234 patients in whom coronary angiography was performed. The median interval from onset of symptoms till the angiographic documentation of patency was 200 minutes. Data were analysed according to the original treatment allocation. Global left ventricular ejection fraction was determined by radionuclide angiography in 418 patients within two days of admission, in 361 patients after two weeks, and in 307 patients after three months. Global left ventricular function remained unchanged throughout the observation period in the control group, whereas it improved during the first two weeks in patients allocated to thrombolytic treatment. Improved function in these patients persisted up to three months after the infarction. Global left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly better in the thrombolysis group than in the control group at two days, two weeks, and at three months. In patients with anterior myocardial infarction the left ventricular ejection fraction was 9% better than in the control group at two weeks and at three months. In the patients with inferior myocardial infarction differences between the two treatment groups were smaller because of photon attenuation within the body. Angiographic evidence suggested that the improvement in function seen after thrombolysis is indeed associated with the patency of the infarct related artery.\r"

The effect of epoprostenol infusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction was evaluated in a randomised double blind study of 45 patients with evidence of myocardial infarction of less than 16 hours' duration. The patients were given a 72 hour infusion of epoprostenol (23) or placebo (22). The maximum dose was 5 ng/kg/min. The mean time to treatment was 8.3 hours (range 3.8-15.9 hours). The mean dose was 4.9 ng/kg/min. The patients were followed until day 30. No significant differences were found between the groups in mortality, development of congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, recurrent chest pain, reinfarction, peak creatine kinase concentration, or the time taken to attain peak creatine kinase concentration. No significant difference in baseline ejection fraction was noted between groups, and no significant change in ejection fraction occurred within each group or between groups. The only significant side effect was the development of facial flushing in the epoprostenol group. In this pilot study epoprostenol was well tolerated by patients with acute myocardial infarction. No benefit from epoprostenol could be demonstrated at the dose range used when the drug was administered within 16 hours of the onset of symptoms.\r"

Non-invasive determination of the mean pressure gradient by Doppler ultrasonography is, however, complicated by the squared relation between instantaneous velocities and pressure differences. The validity of a new simple formula for calculation of the mean pressure difference from the peak pressure difference was evaluated in 26 patients with aortic stenosis. The formula is: delta pmean = 0.64 delta ppeak, where delta pmean is the mean pressure gradient and delta ppeak the peak pressure gradient. There was a close correlation between the mean pressure differences determined by application of the formula to the peak pressure differences measured at catheterisation and the mean pressure differences obtained by planimetry (r = 0.97, SEE = 4.7 mm Hg). The correlation between mean pressure differences determined by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound and the formula and those measured by planimetry was also close (r = 0.91, SEE = 7.6 mm Hg) and only three patients showed a difference between the two methods of greater than 10 mm Hg. The new formula is a simple and reliable means of estimating the mean pressure difference from Doppler recordings and it facilitates the comparison of Doppler and catheterisation data.\r"

A high degree of with-the-rule astigmatism was evident in all patients two weeks postoperatively, but thereafter the character of the astigmatism produced by 8/0 virgin silk and 10/0 monofilament closure was quite different: in the 8/0 virgin silk group there was an early and pronounced shift in the axis of astigmatism to against-the-rule, whereas in the 10/0 monofilament group there was little further change in the astigmatism unless the sutures were removed. Wound compression and wound gape as factors responsible for these changes are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87076933\r", 
  ".W": "Hemoglobin's physiologic properties depend on the orderly assembly of its subunits in erythropoietic cells. The biosynthesis of alpha- and beta-globin polypeptide chains is normally balanced. Heme rapidly binds to the globin subunit, either during translation or shortly thereafter. The formation of the alpha beta-dimer is facilitated by electrostatic attraction of a positively charged alpha-subunit to a negatively charged beta-subunit. The alpha beta-dimer dissociates extremely slowly. The difference between the rate of dissociation of alpha beta- and alpha gamma-dimers with increasing pH explains the well-known alkaline resistance of Hb F. Two dimers combine to form the functioning alpha 2 beta 2-tetramer. This model of hemoglobin assembly explains the different levels of positively charged and negatively charged mutant hemoglobins that are encountered in heterozygotes and the effect of alpha-thalassemia and heme deficiency states in modifying the level of the variant hemoglobin as well as Hb A2. Electrostatic interactions also affect the binding of hemoglobin to the cytoplasmic surface of the red cell membrane and may underlie the formation of target cells. Enhanced binding of positively charged variants such as S and C trigger a normally dormant pathway for potassium and water loss. Thus, the positive charge on beta c is responsible for the two major contributors to the pathogenesis of Hb SC disease: increased proportion of Hb S and increased intracellular hemoglobin concentration. It is likely that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the assembly of a number of other multisubunit macromolecules, including membrane receptors, cytoskeletal proteins, and DNA binding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue factor (TF) is a lipoprotein cofactor that markedly enhances the proteolytic activation of factors IX and X by factor VIIa. The functional activity of TF is inhibited by serum in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion. The inhibitory effect is also dependent on the presence of calcium ions and can be reversed by calcium chelation (EDTA) and dilution, thus excluding direct proteolytic destruction of TF as the mechanism for inhibition. Using crude TF, serum immunodepleted of factor VII, and serum depleted of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors by BaSO4 absorption, it is shown that TF factor inhibition requires the presence of VII(a), X(a), and an additional moiety contained in barium-absorbed serum. When each of the other required components were at saturating concentrations, half-maximal inhibition of TF occurred in reaction mixtures containing 2% (vol/vol) of TF at a factor VII(a) concentration of 4 ng/mL (80 pmol/L), a factor X concentration of 50 ng/mL (850 pmol/L), and a concentration of barium-absorbed serum of 2.5% (vol/vol). Catalytically active factor Xa appeared to be required for the generation of optimal TF inhibition. The results are consistent with the conclusions of Hjort that barium-absorbed serum contains a moiety that inhibits the VIIa-Ca2+-TF complex. The role of factor X(a) in the generation of the inhibitory phenomenon remains to be elucidated. The inhibitor present in serum (plasma) may in part be produced by the liver in vivo since cultured human hepatoma cells (HepG2) secrete this inhibitory activity in vitro.\r"

Both M4 and M5 samples show a strong positive correlation between the amount of c-fos transcripts and the percentage of leukemic cells expressing surface antigens specific for mature monocytes and macrophages. Normal mature monocytes exhibit a detectable level of c-fos RNA, which is virtually unaltered on activation to macrophage differentiation, but is always below that observed in M4 through M5 monocyticlike cells. These data provide evidence that c-fos expression is linked to terminal monocyte and macrophage differentiation in normal and leukemic hemopoiesis.\r"

The current study extended this observation to a second monoclonal antibody (HB10a) that identifies a different determinant on Ia-like molecules. These results suggest the presence of Ia-like antigens on pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells or on \"accessory cells\" needed for sustained engraftment to occur. To distinguish between these two possibilities, stem cell-depleted Ia-positive peripheral blood leukocytes obtained by discontinuous albumin density gradient were added as probable source of accessory cells to the marrow inoculum that was depleted of Ia-positive cells by treatment with antibody 7.2 and complement. Eight of ten dogs failed to show engraftment, providing further support for the hypothesis that pluripotent stem cells and not accessory cells were affected by cytolytic treatment. To provide direct evidence for the presence of Ia-like antigens on canine pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, autologous transplants were performed using 0.7 to 13 X 10(6) Ia (7.2)-positive marrow cells per kg obtained with the help of fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Of three evaluable dogs, two showed sustained and complete engraftment, indicating that Ia-like antigens, as recognized by anti-class II antibody 7.2, are expressed at least on part of canine pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Concurrent in vitro studies revealed that canine CFU-GM also expressed Ia-like antigens as recognized by the class II-specific monoclonal antibodies 7.2 and HB10a.\r"

C71/26 immunoprecipitates as a broad band of mol wt 87,000 to 100,000 as determined by radioiodination of the platelet cell surface and by the 3H-sodium borohydride labeling technique. Immunoblotting showed Pgp-1 expression on platelets to be quantitatively similar to its presence on macrophages and resolved platelet Pgp-1 into two bands of mol wt 87,000 and 97,000 whereas Pgp-1 on parasite-elicited peritoneal macrophages showed 82,000 and 87,000 mol wt species. Platelets and monocyte/macrophage cells from either peripheral blood or from the peritoneal cavity showed homogeneous binding of Pgp-1 antibody to greater than 97% of cells by flow cytometry. In contrast, lymphocytes from peripheral blood or from the spleen showed a heterogeneous binding pattern with 20% to 30% of cells being negative, and the majority weakly positive. In functional studies, MoAbs against CR1 and CR3 substantially inhibited platelet immune adherence, whereas C71/26 showed only marginal inhibitor. In contrast, C71/26 and other MoAbs against Pgp-1 inhibited platelet-dependent cytotoxicity of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes in the presence of C5-deficient mouse plasma whereas M1/70 against CR3 showed no effect. In this assay, MoAbs against the alpha- and beta-subunits of leukocyte functional molecule LFA-1 also inhibited platelet cytotoxicity. These results show that the platelet cell surface moieties Pgp-1 and LFA-1 are involved in or closely associated with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by platelets.\r"

A recombinant clone of approximately 1100 base pairs in length containing the sequence of factor X was identified in a lambda gt11 human liver cDNA library by screening with polyclonal antibodies. One plaque was selected and confirmed for specificity with a mixture of five factor X specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). A partial nucleic acid sequence of the 5' end of the cDNA corresponded to the described amino acid sequence between residues 41 and 56 of the light chain of factor X. Northern blot analysis of RNA from human liver and the hepatoma cell line, Hep G2, identified the factor X mRNA as a single molecular species of approximately 1700 bases. Cell lines which do not secrete factor X did not contain factor X mRNA indicating restriction of transcription to hepatocytes. Slot-blot hybridization analysis of factor X and actin mRNA demonstrated no change in the levels of total or specific factor X mRNA in Hep G2 cells following treatment with warfarin or vitamin K. We conclude that modulation of factor X production by these drugs, known to influence gamma-carboxylation and total factor X secretion by these cells, is mediated by changes in posttranscriptional events rather than by effects on the steady state levels of factor X mRNA.\r"

Saturable, high-affinity binding of 125I-transferrin was demonstrated on intact cells at 4 degrees C, with average receptor numbers 20,900 +/- 3,160 (mean + SD, n = 4) for hepatocytes and 5,500 + 1,520 (n = 3) for nonparenchymal cells.

Immunocytochemical demonstration of transferrin using antitransferrin, peroxidase antiperoxidase complex confirmed that both cell types bound transferrin. There was heterogeneity of the staining reaction since there was no detectable staining on 40% of hepatocytes and 60% of nonparenchymal cells. Microdensitometric analysis of the staining product corroborated the biochemical evidence that hepatocytes have, on average, more than three times more transferrin receptors than do nonparenchymal cells.

After cleavage of dimers and multimers with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease, the location of interchain disulfide bonds in amino (N)-terminal or carboxyl (C)-terminal fragments was determined by gel electrophoresis under reduced and nonreduced conditions. The first interchain disulfide bonds formed during dimerization are in the C-terminal region of the subunits, whereas interdimer disulfide bonds are located in the N-terminal portion. These data confirm recent electron microscopic projections of disulfide bond locations and provide support to the hypothetical role of the propolypeptide in the multimerization process.\r"

The aim of this study is to define the nature of the intrinsic B cell defects found in marrow recipients using assays for B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. B cells from five short-term (less than three months postgrafting) and 15 long-term (greater than one year postgrafting) marrow recipients (ten with and five without chronic graft-v -host disease [GVHD]) were studied. T cell supernatants (T-sup) were prepared by stimulating normal T cells with 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and phytohemagglutinin. Highly purified B cells were used to assess B cell proliferation responses to T-sup after Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) activation and for B cell immunoglobulin production responses to T-sup stimulation after SAC activation. B cells from all five short-term patients and one long-term patient with chronic GVHD did not respond to any stimulation. B cells from two patients with chronic GVHD responded to SAC but had decreased proliferative and differentiative responses to T-sup. B cells from three of seven patients with chronic GVHD and two of five long-term healthy patients could proliferate but could not secrete immunoglobulin in response to SAC plus T-sup stimulation. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between serum IgG and/or IgM in marrow recipients and the differentiative responses of their B cells to T-sup (P = 0.0075, Fisher's Exact). B cell defects occur at various stages of maturation postgrafting. These defects include the failure to respond to the SAC activation signal, the failure to proliferate in response to T-sup, and the failure to differentiate in response to T-sup. These findings are probably due to the inability of B cells from certain marrow recipients to undergo a second round of ontogeny.\r"

Both PMN accumulation and PMN-dependent plasma leakage were abolished in the inflammatory skin lesions of rabbits pretreated with MoAb 60.3 as compared with control animals, whereas histamine-induced PMN-independent plasma leakage was unaffected. Intravital microscopy of the rabbit tenuissimus muscle revealed that MoAb 60.3 inhibited both PMN adherence in the venules and migration into the tissue following application of LTB4 and zymosan-activated serum (ZAS). Rolling of PMNs along the venular endothelium was unaffected. Thus, these experiments confirm and extend earlier in vitro findings of the critical role of the membrane glycoprotein complex, CD18, in PMN adherence and chemotaxis.\r"

  ".W": "Human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been synthesized in high yield using a temperature inducible plasmid in Escherichia coli. The human GM-CSF is readily isolated from the bacterial proteins because of its differential solubility and chromatographic properties. The bacterially synthesized form of the human GM-CSF contains an extra methionine residue at position 1, but otherwise it is identical to the polypeptide predicted from the cDNA sequence. The specific activity of 2.9 X 10(7) units/mg of protein for purified bacterially synthesized human GM-CSF indicates that despite the lack of glycosylation, the molecule is substantially in its native conformation. This molecule stimulated the same number and type of both seven- and 14-day human bone marrow colonies as the CSF alpha preparation from human placental conditioned medium. Human GM-CSF had no activity on murine bone marrow or murine leukemic cells. There was no detectable, direct stimulation of adult human erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E) by the bacterially synthesized human GM-CSF. Although impure preparations containing native human GM-CSF (eg, human placental conditioned medium) stimulated the formation of mixed colonies, even in the presence of erythropoietin, the bacterially synthesized human GM-CSF failed to stimulate the formation of mixed colonies from adult human bone marrow cells. The bacterially synthesized human GM-CSF increased N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-induced superoxide production and lysozyme secretion. Antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis by human neutrophils was stimulated by the bacterially synthesized human GM-CSF and eosinophils were also activated in the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients with advanced preleukemic syndromes were treated with marrow transplantation. Most cases were diagnosed by the presence of peripheral pancytopenia and a diagnostic marrow examination but in 6 of the 30 patients pretransplant chromosome studies were instrumental in establishing the diagnosis. Three patients prepared for transplantation with cyclophosphamide alone recurred with their disease within 6 months of transplantation. The other 27 patients were treated with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. Twenty of these 27 patients had preleukemia not associated with prior therapy or severe marrow fibrosis. Thirteen of these 20 are alive and well 9 to 56 months from transplant and 7 died, 4 of interstitial pneumonia, 2 of candida septicemia, and 1 of disseminated zoster. There have been no disease recurrences in this group. The remaining preleukemic patients, which include 3 patients transplanted for preleukemia secondary to prior therapy and 4 patients transplanted for preleukemia associated with severe marrow fibrosis, have all died. Major problems in these patients included disease recurrence (2 cases) and, in those with severe marrow fibrosis, graft failure (2 cases). These results suggest that for patients with life-threatening pancytopenia due to spontaneous preleukemia without severe marrow fibrosis, marrow transplantation can prolong disease-free survival and may result in cure of the disease.\r"

There were 12 rejection episodes in 9 patients in the early post-transplant period, and 7 rejection episodes in 7 patients at the time of conversion from cyclosporin A to azathioprine. All of these episodes were correctly diagnosed by ultrasound. Eight episodes of drug induced toxicity in seven patients were, in all but one case, diagnosed correctly.

  ".W": "When patients are admitted to hospital with acute abdominal pain, clinicians, irrespective of a specific diagnosis, intuitively select three diagnostic classes: operation definitely required (Group A); operation definitely not required (Group B); need for operation uncertain (Group C). The last is followed either by a precautionary laparotomy or a variable period of observation/investigation. We have studied prospectively the influence of laparoscopy on the distribution between these classes and particularly on outcome in group C. One hundred and twenty-five consecutive patients with abdominal pain severe enough for emergency admission have been classified by one of two admitting surgeons (SHO/registrar), who also expressed in group C a view on how they would proceed--operation or observation. Group C were then laparoscoped. The procedure confirmed a provisional view that laparotomy was needed in 11 of 15 patients. In the 'observation' sub-group the provisional decision was confirmed in 14 of 16 and early discharge followed in most. Six inappropriate decisions were thus avoided. Seven management decisions in group A and 4 in group B proved incorrect (11/94: 12 per cent). The majority were potentially recognizable by laparoscopy. Though relatively high rates of successful decision making are achieved with conventional clinical techniques, they can be further improved by laparoscopy. This procedure is particularly applicable in the management of patients with acute abdominal pain without a definite diagnosis, or when appendicitis is regarded as an established diagnosis.\r"

A total of 112 patients entered the study, of whom 54 received a drain. There was no significant difference between the drainage and the non-drainage groups with respect to mean age or sex distribution, the number of patients in whom the gallbladder bed was formally closed (27 versus 21) nor in the number of acute cholecystectomies performed in either group (12 versus 13). Ultrasound detected 10 (18 per cent) collections in the drainage group and only one (1.8 per cent) in the non-drainage group (P less than 0.01, chi 2 test). None of the collections required any further treatment and no morbidity occurred that was directly attributable to the presence of the retained fluid. These results suggest that rather than preventing fluid collections, suction drains may predispose to the development of subhepatic collections after cholecystectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) are a diverse group of malignant diseases whose clinical behaviour and treatment are distinct from those of Hodgkin's disease. In advanced-stage NHL certain histologic subtypes grow relatively slowly, initially produce few symptoms and, even when untreated, are associated with survival that is usually measured in years. Other, less favourable subtypes grow more rapidly, produce symptoms earlier and result in rapid clinical deterioration and death if aggressive treatment is not begun at the time of diagnosis. Many patients with advanced-stage higher-grade NHL can now expect cure, whereas those with lower-grade NHL cannot. Among the higher-grade lymphomas, factors associated with a poorer prognosis include B symptoms, age greater than 50 years, bulky disease (particularly in the abdomen) and extranodal disease with bone marrow or gastrointestinal involvement. These factors have less effect on prognosis in lower-grade lymphomas. Combination chemotherapy (CT) has been the mainstay of treatment for advanced-stage higher-grade NHL. Newer regimens contain more agents given earlier in the treatment plan. Radiotherapy is a useful supplement to CT in some patients with bulky disease. Most CT regimens have been developed through retrospective uncontrolled studies. Prospective randomized clinical trials must be designed to compare the efficacy of newer, more toxic but seemingly more effective regimens and earlier, less toxic regimens. Such trials should determine which patients may achieve optimal survival results with the least toxic therapy.\r"

Two patients in whom adverse immunologic effects other than isolated agranulocytosis developed during treatment with propylthiouracil are described. A review of the literature revealed 53 similar cases over a 35-year period. Rash, fever, arthralgias and granulocytopenia were the most common manifestations. Vasculitis, particularly with cutaneous manifestations, occurs and may be fatal. The clinical evidence suggests that an immunologic mechanism is involved. A number of different autoantibodies were reported, but antinuclear antibodies were infrequent, and none of the cases met the criteria for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, the reactions do not represent a true drug-induced lupus syndrome. Current hypotheses and experimental data regarding the cause of the reactions are reviewed. No specific clinical subgroup at high risk can be identified, and manifestations may occur at any dosage and at any time during therapy. Cross-reactivity between the two antithyroid drugs can be expected. Except for minor symptoms (e.g., mild arthralgias or transient rash), such reactions are an indication for withdrawal of the drug and the use of alternative methods to control the hyperthyroidism. In rare cases of severe vasculitis a short course of high-dose glucocorticoid therapy may be helpful.\r"

Both benign and malignant tumors defined by the presence or absence of invasion and metastasis stained positively for thyroglobulin. Most tumors expressed both CEA and p21 ras oncogene product. Clinicopathologic analysis showed that malignant tumors were larger, occurred in slightly older patients (mean age, 52.8 years), and had an almost equal sex distribution, whereas benign tumors were more common in women and occurred in younger patients (mean age, 44.7 years). These results indicate that both benign and malignant Hurthle cell thyroid tumors produce thyroglobulin and express both CEA and p21 ras oncogene product, whereas adjacent normal thyroid tissues showed weak to absent immunoreactivity for p21 ras oncogene product. Because there are no specific immunohistochemical markers to distinguish between benign and malignant Hurthle cell tumors, one needs to rely on traditional histologic features such as invasion and metastasis to distinguish between benign and malignant Hurthle cell neoplasms.\r"

Adenomas were variably positive for H substance, and expression of the antigen appeared to correlate with the degree of dysplasia seen on microscopic examination. Normal colonic mucosa, nonadenomatous polyps, and nonepithelial colonic neoplasms studied failed to express H substance.

In the case of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), one showed a strong reaction, whereas the others were variably less stained. Cytokeratins (45 kd and 54 kd) specific for simple epithelia, including coelomic epithelium, were regularly found in all cases; a small number of cells were positive for high molecular weight cytokeratin (57 kd) and none for 66 kd cytokeratin. Coexpression of both cytokeratin and vimentin was confirmed using fresh-frozen materials. Therefore, both microscopic and immunohistochemical evidence supports the hypothesis that epithelioid sarcoma masquerades as a carcinoma.\r"

The incidence rate of cancer of the cervix among the Haitian and United States born black groups was also compared. Increased rates of certain malignancies associated with viral infection or immunodeficiency were found in the Haitian group. These tumors were hepatocellular carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, reticulum cell sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The age-adjusted incidence rate of carcinoma of the cervix was especially high among Haitian women even with a liberal estimate of the female Haitian population from whom the cases were drawn.

Continued epidemiological study of larger numbers of patients is needed to evaluate these findings further.\r"

  ".W": "The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) undertook a prospective randomized trial using a single chemotherapy regimen with or without trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TS). In a previous acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) study of initial therapy, investigators were free to use TS prophylaxis or not. Analysis of those data seemed to favor TS for duration of continuous complete remission. In the study reported here, of 126 randomized patients with ALL, 63 received TS. There was no effect of TS on disease-free survival after 3 years follow-up. Overall severe toxicity did not differ. However, granulocytopenia was somewhat more severe in the TS group. Hepatic toxicity, measured by enzyme elevation approached significance in the TS group versus controls. Some institutions declined randomization and treated with or without TS as a routine. Outcome and toxicities did not differ from randomized patients. There was no statistically significant effect on severe, life-threatening or fatal infection between the randomized TS versus control groups. Children not receiving TS developed varicella more often, a disease for which one would not expect TS to show a preventative effect. Pneumocystis pneumonias were not reported. The authors conclude that TS prophylaxis did not increase the continuous complete remission rate in children with ALL or decrease the incidence of infection. Toxicity is somewhat higher on TS.\r"

  ".W": "The identification of lymphatic and vascular channels with immunohistochemical reagents directed against antigens of the endothelial cells was undertaken in formalin-fixed breast tissues from 100 women with infiltrating mammary duct carcinoma. Fifty women had had lymphatic tumor emboli identified in the original review of their slides. Each case was matched with a control of similar size and laterality. From each case one section containing tumor and normal tissue was stained with antibodies directed against Factor VIII-related antigen, blood group antigen A, blood group antigen B and with Ulex europaeus I agglutinin. All specimens with a reaction displayed variation in the intensity of the stain as well as in the propensity of a given endothelial lined channel to stain at all. Factor VIII-related antigen was identified in 96 tissue samples and Ulex europaeus I agglutinin reacted with 75 specimens. Reactivity of endothelium to blood group antigens either A, B, or both was found in 63 samples. Twenty-one of 26 (81%) samples with endothelial-lined channels which contained tumor emboli in the hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) section showed a reaction to one or more of the reagents. In six other cases involvement of endothelial-lined channels was detected only in the specially stained sections, but in three of these, the tumor emboli appeared only in these deeper sections and could have been detected by serial sections stained with H & E. The results of this study indicate that examination of H & E sections is a reliable method of identifying tumor involvement of endothelial-lined channels. Immunohistochemical stains may be of assistance in occasional cases, but with the reagents currently available this methodology is subject to false-positive and false-negative results.\r"

Cryostat sections of various normal and neoplastic human tissues were examined. The presence of antigenic activity was demonstrated in 20 of 39 (51%) primary skin melanomas, in 21 of 52 (40%) metastatic melanomas, and in 20 of 44 (45%) nevi. The reactive nevi were restricted to intradermal, junctional, compound and spindle cell types. Of the 110 samples of 12 major tumor types other than melanoma tested, only 1 of 6 epidermoid tumors, 1 of 4 benign breast tumors and 1 of 5 prostatic tumors gave weak staining. This antibody also reacted with sweat glands and fetal small intestine tissue, but not with other adult or fetal normal tissues. Intrapatient as well as interpatient heterogeneity in the epitope expression was present in primary as well as metastatic tumor lesions surgically removed from patients with melanoma. Evaluation of the immunohistologic data and the clinical outcome of patients with melanoma reveals that the expression of the epitope recognized by this antibody is associated with a more favorable prognosis.\r"

Peripheral giant cell granuloma, central giant cell granuloma, giant cell tumor, osteitis fibrosa cystica, cherubism, and giant cell tumor of tendon sheath showed similar patterns of reactivity. Granulomatous inflammatory lesions stained more intensely for muramidase than did noninflammatory lesions. Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin was a slightly better marker of giant cell lesions than was alpha-1-antitrypsin. Positive S-100 protein staining in half the lesions was thought to be due to the presence of Langerhans cells. The results supported the belief that giant cell lesions of bone and tendon sheath are differentiated toward cells of the mononuclear-phagocyte system and that multinucleated giant cells are derived from macrophages.\r"

This offers a simple opportunity to determine the growth fraction of tumors by immunostaining of fresh tissue. One hundred fifty-four invasive carcinomas of the breast were used in this study. The average number of Ki-67 positive cells was 15.3 +/- 10.1% (range, 1%-48%), whereas in 41 benign lesions of the breast only 4.4 +/- 2.6% (range, 1%-10%) of cells were positive. A correlation was found between growth fractions and histologic grading. On average, N+ tumors with less than four positive lymph nodes had a significantly higher growth fraction (20.4 +/- 14.2%) than N0 tumors (13.0 +/- 9.2%), whereas N+ tumors with more than three lymph node metastases had only 17.3 +/- 3.6% Ki-67 positive cells. This method yielded similar results to those obtained by other researchers through the use of flow cytometry and thymidine labeling. Determination of growth fractions by Ki-67 is suitable for routine use and may be useful in prognosis and in the selection of patients for various treatment modalities.\r"

This study describes the methods of development for MoAb HMSA-2 and the specificity and distribution of antigen(s) reactive with it in normal and pathological tissues. Characteristically, MoAb HMSA-2 was found to detect neoplastic melanocytes on formalin-fixed and paraffin-processed specimens. The reaction patterns for benign and malignant melanocytic tumors were different, i.e., homogeneous reactivity in the dermal cells of common melanocytic nevi but heterogeneous reactivity in the same type of cells in malignant melanoma. MoAb HMSA-2 reacted positively with the epidermal melanocytes in the lesions of dysplastic melanocytic nevi, but not with those of common melanocytic nevi. Reaction products with MoAb HMSA-2 were localized in the cytoplasm. MoAb HMSA-2 did not react with normal melanocytes even on frozen sections. Benign and malignant epithelial and soft tissue tumors of the skin were usually negatively stained with MoAb HMSA-2. Findings indicate that MoAb HMSA-2 is a unique MoAb which identifies neoplastic melanocytes and which can be useful in differentiating each type of melanocytic tumor.\r"

The mAb gave better results than the pAb on poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Many of the thyroid carcinomas in this study, especially the poorly differentiated and anaplastic type, failed to react with all four mAb to Tg. These results confirm the notion of the heterogeneity of Tg in thyroid carcinomas and indicate that a battery of carefully selected mAb can be successfully used for routine histopathologic detection of Tg in these tumors.\r"

Results showed that cells forming solid nests had immunoreactivity for calcitonin, low molecular weight keratin, and CEA, but not for thyroglobulin, thyroxin and high molecular weight keratin. Thus, SCN do not result from tangentially cut thyroid follicles (absence of staining for thyroglobulin and thyroxin), nor from a squamous metaplastic process (absence of staining for high molecular weight keratin), but instead they are formed by C-cells because they showed calcitonin immunoreactivity, and neurosecretory granules.\r"

Varying population densities of S-100-positive LC were noted in tumor tissues; lysozyme-positive macrophages, however, were found in almost equal quantities. LC were mainly interspersed among the tumor cells, whereas macrophages were present in the stroma and around the necrotic foci. Although the survival time of patients with Stage I, II or IV gastric carcinoma did not relate to the density of LC, survival time in Stage III patients correlated well with the density of LC. In patients with a marked infiltration of LC, survival time was longer than in cases of only a slight infiltration (P less than 0.001). Therefore, LC in immunological defense mechanisms of the host against the tumor may be clinically effective in a certain phase of tumor development.\r"

The carcinomas were frequently multiple, recurrent, and clinically aggressive. The tumors showed unusually poor differentiation histologically. Actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinomas were frequently associated with SCC. Fifty percent metastasized to cervical lymph nodes replaced by WDLL. Lymphadenopathy due to metastatic SCC may be mistaken for malignant lymphoma alone. In two of five patients (40%), death was directly attributable to SCC. As in renal transplant recipients, SCC of the head and neck in WDLL patients is a common cause of significant complications and mortality requiring aggressive management. Immunosuppression due to WDLL and/or to chemotherapy is likely an important predisposing factor in combination with sun exposure.\r"

Preoperative hematocrit, urinalysis, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and ferritin levels were obtained in 24 patients with hypernephroma. At the time of radical nephrectomy, a tumor specimen was obtained from all 24 patients and corresponding normal renal tissue was obtained from eight patients. Fifteen patients had low serum iron, whereas nine patients had normal serum iron. All tissue samples were snap frozen at the time of surgery and were subsequently sectioned into 3-microns slices using the cryostat. Then all the sectioned specimens were stained with FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and peroxidase conjugated rabbit derived anti-human lactoferrin. Ten of the 15 patients with low serum iron had positive anti-lactoferrin staining in both the FITC and peroxidase systems. None of the tumors from patients with normal serum iron and none of the normal renal parenchyma exhibited positive anti-lactoferrin uptake. Stains for iron in the bone marrow of two patients with low serum iron showed increased iron stores. These studies suggest that lactoferrin mediates the anemia often seen in association with renal cell carcinoma.\r"

Identification of patients who are declining from end-stage cardiac disease and may be expected to die within 12 months or less and deciding which of a number of cardiac invalids are reasonable candidates for cardiac transplantation involves prognostication as well as a working knowledge of the expected benefits and survival rates in cardiac transplantation. Screening by means of the currently accepted contraindications for cardiac transplantation is somewhat more difficult in 1986 than it was 10 years ago when these contraindications were changing less rapidly. However, for optimal use of the limited supply of donor organs and maintenance of reasonable survival rates such screening is absolutely necessary. A second area of restriction that is less approachable by the physician is that of financial limitations. It would appear that the working poor and lower middle class may be deprived of the opportunity for cardiac transplantation much as they are deprived of the opportunity for optimal medical care in our society today.\r"

  ".W": "A new cardioselective beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonist, xamoterol, has been developed for the treatment of heart failure, especially that associated with ischemic heart disease. To investigate the hemodynamic effect of xamoterol in relation to sympathetic nervous activity, hemodynamic variables and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were measured at rest and during three graded bicycle exercise tests before and after a single intravenous dose of 0.15 mg/kg xamoterol in 10 patients with mild-to-moderate left ventricular dysfunction. Plasma NE increased with increasing grade of exercise and a linear correlation between plasma NE and heart rate was observed at four time points (at rest and three exercise levels) before and after xamoterol. After administration of xamoterol, the slope of the regression line of plasma NE-heart rate relation was significantly less steep than that before drug. Predose and postdose regression lines crossed at 440 pg/ml of plasma NE. Similar effects were observed on the plasma NE-cardiac index and plasma NE-systolic blood pressure relations (regression lines crossed at 380 and 530 pg/ml of plasma NE, respectively). Thus, xamoterol had a dual agonist-antagonist effect in relation to plasma NE, and the crossover point lay approximately between 400 pg/ml and 500 pg/ml. This level of plasma NE was achieved at a low exercise level and at a heart rate of about 100 beats/min. These results indicate that xamoterol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity comparable to relatively low sympathetic activity (400 to 500 pg/ml of plasma NE) and therefore acts as a beta 1-agonist when sympathetic nervous activity is below this level and as an antagonist when sympathetic activity is above this level.\r"

  ".W": "Assessment of the effects of pharmacologic agents on renal blood flow (RBF) is clinically important in many disease states, including hypertension and congestive heart failure. However, because of the complexities of RBF, quantitation in vivo has been technically difficult. This study demonstrates the utility of ultrasound imaging of the kidney combined with injection of a sonicated radiocontrast solution (Renografin-76) for the assessment of regional renal blood flow. The technique uses a suspension of uniform microbubbles (diameter 4.4 +/- 2.8 micron), which when injected directly into the descending aorta are distinctly visualized by renal ultrasound. Five dogs were studied. Catheters were placed in the descending aorta for injection of sonicated Renografin and in the renal artery for drug infusions. Data were collected before and during intrarenal artery infusions of bradykinin and norepinephrine. Total RBF was measured by electromagnetic flowmeter. Video density time curves were generated for comparable segments of the outer renal cortex and fit to a monoexponential decay curve. This allowed calculation of the mean exponential decay index (t1/2). An increase in t1/2 paralleled decreased renal perfusion (i.e., longer washout of contrast material). The opposite was true for a decrease in t1/2. Bradykinin increased RBF from 134 +/- 26 to 249 +/- 19 ml/min (p less than .01 vs control), and norepinephrine decreased RBF from 130 +/- 25 to 51 +/- 17 ml/min (p less than .01 vs control).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The endogenous opioid system includes three major families of peptides: dynorphins (derived from pre-proenkephalin B), endorphins (derived from pre-proopiomelanocortin), and enkephalins (derived from pre-proenkephalin A). Multiple species of opioid peptides are derived from these major precursors and many of them possess potent cardiovascular properties. Opioid peptides and opioid receptors, of which multiple forms have been defined, are present in the central nervous system and peripheral neural elements. In the central nervous system, opioid peptides and receptors are found in forebrain and hindbrain nuclei involved in baroregulation, sympathoadrenal activation, and several other vital autonomic functions. In the periphery, opioid peptides are found in autonomic ganglia, adrenal gland, heart, and other organs; multiple opioid receptors are also found in vascular tissue, heart, and kidneys. Although little is known to date on the regulatory mechanisms of the opioid system in normal cardiovascular states, it became clear that cardiovascular stress situations substantially modify the activity of the endogenous opioid system. The purpose of this review is to clarify the sites of interaction of the opioid system with all major components of the cardiovascular system and indicate the potential role of this system in the ontogenesis of cardiac malfunction, vascular diseases, and hypertension.\r"

To consider our hypothesis that cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors suppress renin release in these patients, it was necessary to prove that \"low pressure\" receptors affected renin levels in man. A series of experiments was performed to selectively alter the stretch (load) on carotid and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors in healthy human volunteers. These studies showed that selectively altering high-pressure baroreceptor load did not affect plasma renin activity. Selectively unloading the low-pressure receptors increased plasma renin activity. Simultaneous unloading of both baroreceptors caused the largest increases in renin activity. While the data indicated an interaction of high- and low-pressure receptors on the neural regulation of renin release, we interpreted these results as evidence for a predominant influence of cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors on the neurogenic regulation of renin secretion in man.\r"

This enzyme is synthesized in the heart, based on the following evidence: renin messenger RNA was detected in mouse heart by Northern blot hybridization and renin activity was found in isolated cardiac myocytes.

  ".W": "The Dahl strain of genetically salt-resistant (DR) and salt-sensitive (DS) rats affords an opportunity to explore mechanisms responsible for salt resistance and sensitivity. Dahl sensitive rats exhibit abnormalities in sympathetic neural control of the circulation and in renal sodium handling. Since cardiac baroreflexes participate in regulation of sympathetic nerve activity and sodium excretion, we have evaluated cardiac baroreflex function in DR and DS rats. This article briefly reviews evidence that cardiac sensory endings with vagal afferents are reset to a higher threshold in DS rats before elevation of arterial or cardiac filling pressures, as a result of this resetting, cardiac baroreflex inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity during volume expansion is impaired in prehypertensive DS rats, a high-sodium diet enhances the gain of cardiac baroreflex inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity in DR but not DS rats, and atrial natriuretic factor stimulates cardiac sensory receptors with vagal afferents. Taken together, these studies prompt speculation that humoral factors released during intake of a high-sodium diet may sensitize cardiac baroreflexes and thereby protect against sodium retention and hypertension. An absence of this compensatory adjustment or plasticity in cardiac baroreflex function in DS rats may predispose to salt-induced hypertension.\r"

Captopril reduced left ventricular mass, prevented the increase in right ventricular mass observed with increasing infarct size, lessened the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and reduced mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance, whereas cardiac output and heart rate were maintained. The end-diastolic volume of treated rats with moderate infarcts was significantly less than that of untreated rats, and therefore the ejection fraction index was significantly increased. In rats given captopril until death or for a period of up to 1 year, survival was significantly prolonged, particularly in those rats with moderate-sized infarcts.\r"

Coronary blood flow was determined by thermodilution before and after 1 week of diuretic therapy in six patients and before and after placebo in four patients. The diuretic (50 mg/day furosemide) reduced coronary blood flow and increased coronary vascular resistance; in these same patients, captopril reduced mean arterial pressure and the rate-pressure product but increased coronary flow significantly. There was no change in any of these variables after captopril in the placebo group. Similar results were obtained in normotensive rats treated with hydrochlorothiazide; the increase in coronary flow after captopril correlated significantly with the control plasma renin activity. These results in hypertensive humans and normotensive experimental animals indicate that diuretic therapy reduces coronary blood flow significantly, and angiotensin can play a significant role in modulating coronary vascular resistance under conditions associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade our understanding of the complex interaction between cardiac muscle and coronary vascular growth has increased substantially. Some types of cardiac hypertrophy, for example, left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hyperthyroidism, are associated with increased coronary vascular growth. However, in most animal preparations of hypertrophy and in several clinical types of hypertrophy of the left and/or right ventricles, pathologic cardiac enlargement impairs the ability of the coronary circulation to allow normal increases and perfusion in response to intense dilator stimuli. In general, clinical studies have demonstrated far more profound abnormalities than studies in experimental animals. These observations provide a plausible explanation of why patients with hypertrophied ventricles often exhibit signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia in the absence of coronary obstructive disease. The recent observation that experimentally produced left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to renal hypertension augments infarct size and the incidence of sudden lethal arrhythmias has additional implications relevant to the interaction between cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial perfusion. Although coronary reserve is impaired in many types of pathologic hypertrophy, the anatomic or biochemical basis for these observations remains elusive.\r"

  ".W": "The extracellular structural protein, collagen, is responsible for the functional integrity of the myocardium permitting reversible interdigitation and transmission of force between contracting myocytes. In the pressure-overloaded, hypertrophied myocardium, clinical and experimental evidence indicates that the proportion of collagen relative to muscle is increased. Factors that appear to influence collagen growth during the hypertrophic process include age, species, the rapidity with which the overload occurs, the nature of the lesion leading to the pressure-overload, and the severity and duration of the overload. Morphologically, the heart's collagen matrix consists of a complex weave with tendinous insertions that surrounds myocytes grouping them into myofibers, strands of collagen that connect adjoining myofibers, and collagenous struts that join myocytes to other myocytes and capillaries. In a primate preparation of perinephritis with systemic hypertension, it was observed that the tendinous elements of the weave and the strands of collagen lying between myofibers were increased in number and physical dimension. The functional consequences of a remodeling of the collagen matrix that accompanied myocardial hypertrophy remain to be elucidated. A better understanding of the dynamic behavior of the collagen matrix may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of ventricular dysfunction that accompanies the chronic pressure-overloaded state.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence for the existence of factor(s) other than blood pressure responsible for modulation of myocardial hypertrophy accompanying hypertension is well documented. A factor that has been isolated from the myocardium of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and partially purified has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis in vitro. Three indexes of protein synthesis, namely incorporation of 3H-leucine into myocyte myosin, specific activity of the leucyl tRNA, and rate of protein synthesis, also were observed to significantly increase on exposure to this factor, which may play a key role in the modulation of myocardial hypertrophy that accompanies hypertension. Evidence has also been presented demonstrating the role of unknown factors that control the shift of myosin isozymes from V1 (a high-ATPase, high-contractile protein type) to V3 (a slow ATPase type myosin), and vice versa. This study demonstrates that the modulation of the myocardial mass can be controlled at different levels: first at an intrinsic intracellular level by the mechanism of a local growth factor, and then at the level of the contractile protein, the quality rather than quantity of which was found to be important. Both of these were observed to be modulated by factor(s) independent of blood pressure and myocardial mass. However, it remains to be determined what is responsible at the genetic level for transmitting the signal that selects what type of protein will be synthesized and whether there is a common pathway among all the controlling factors.\r"

Because the consequences of treatment are long-term inconvenience and risk of major complications, objective studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Radiographic procedures such as angiography and lung scanning provide valuable information with low risk to mother and fetus. However, if the clinical situation is strongly suggestive, treatment with intravenous heparin can be immediately initiated followed by definitive diagnosis. When indicated, anticoagulation can be instituted with relative safety, providing there is careful monitoring. Heparin is unquestionably the drug of choice for treatment and prophylaxis during pregnancy. Because warfarin carries a significant risk to the fetus of anomalies and hemorrhage, its use during pregnancy should be reserved for those circumstances in which the benefits of such therapy outweigh the risks. Finally, awareness of the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism, as well as expeditious treatment, remain the mainstays for prevention of maternal and attendant fetal mortality.\r"

A variety of better medical, obstetric, and neonatal care practices have helped considerably to improve the combined life span for affected mothers and fetuses. In the absence of any effective and safe pharmacologic agent to prevent sickle crisis, our experience suggests that adherence to the described management principles offers the greatest hope to the sickling parturient that her vaso-occlusive crises can be effectively managed for a healthy outcome, both for herself and for her baby.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured during oral (OGTT) and intravenous (IVGTT) glucose tolerance tests in nine patients off- and on-treatment with the anabolic steroid, methandienone (Dianabol). On-treatment, the tolerance tests showed a markedly increased insulin response accompanied by impairment of glucose tolerance, characteristics normally attributed to insulin resistance. However, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin (FPI) concentrations were significantly reduced, whereas the pattern normally associated with insulin resistance is for both to be raised. IVGTT glucose and insulin profiles were analysed using an algorithm derived from the minimal models of glucose and insulin dynamics originally proposed by R. Bergman and co-workers. Measures for the following parameters were thus obtained: Si, the sensitivity of glucose disposal to insulin; Sg, net insulin independent glucose disposal; phi 1, the integral concentration of insulin delivered during the first phase of insulin secretion relative to the initial increase in glucose concentration above a model-derived threshold; phi 2, the sensitivity of the rate of rise of insulin concentration in the second phase of insulin secretion to the concentration of glucose above a model-derived threshold; kappa, the fractional clearance rate of insulin; and tau 1/2, the insulin half-life. S1 was significantly reduced on treatment by a factor of 4. Sg, phi 1, phi 2 and tau 1/2 were all significantly increased, and kappa was significantly reduced. The increases in Sg and phi 1 both showed significant correlations with the increase in weight on-treatment. The reduction in FPG and FPI can be explained by the combined effects of the increase in Sg and Dianabol-induced resistance to glucagon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood obtained simultaneously from portal and peripheral veins, during emergency surgery for bleeding oesophageal varices in six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, contained very high concentrations of 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha (range 99-11,485 pg/ml of plasma). 6-Oxo-PGF1 alpha was higher in portal than in peripheral blood in five out of six patients. Six unoperated patients with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices which were not bleeding all had normal peripheral plasma concentrations of 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha less than 2 pg/ml (normal up to 5 pg/ml). Seventeen patients with severe vascular disease had normal basal plasma 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha concentrations (less than 2 pg/ml). Eighteen subjects with atheromatous coronary artery disease underwent aorta-coronary artery grafting, and plasma concentrations of 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha were markedly elevated during surgery (range 55-1207 pg/ml). We conclude that surgery stimulates PGI2 production substantially, and argue that the function of PGI2 may be to limit intravascular extension of thrombus from sites of haemostasis. Inappropriate PGI2 synthesis may contribute to the massive haemorrhage characteristic of oesophageal variceal bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "A quality control (QC) protocol for hematology, as for other sections of the laboratory, should encompass both internal and external QC programs. The extent to which a hematology laboratory should be involved depends upon various factors, including availability of facilities, financial resources, range of tests, workload, the number of staff and their levels of training, and the overall organization of the laboratory. To ensure quality patient care, the intralaboratory QC program must include at least the minimal measures of monitoring and control at each step from collection of blood specimens, through the actual processing and analysis, to reporting of the results. The protocol should be written concisely and in simple language; the procedure manual should offer all of the pertinent information along with references; all concerned personnel should be well trained and competent; and adequate facilities and time should be available for the purpose of QC. Continuing education is also an integral part of an effective QC program. Three very important aspects of QC in hematology are calibration of automated instruments, monitoring of accuracy and precision of instruments and procedures, and verifying the reliability of test results. In the absence of a true primary reference/standard for calibration of instruments for the CBC, the most commonly performed hematologic test, the use of commercial calibrators is acceptable. A combination of commercial controls (three levels) and retained or fresh patient blood specimens is recommended for monitoring of accuracy and precision on a long- and short-term basis. Patient red-cell indices moving average data allow continuous monitoring of instrument performance and should be used as an adjunct to other QC approaches to detecting instrument calibration drift. Correlation of results of related parameters and careful review of blood films remain the two most important and widely used approaches to ensure reliability of results obtained from automated hematology instruments. Participation in an external QC program offers the most practical means of monitoring overall work performance in comparison with instrument, method, and/or reagent-based peer group data. A laboratory may choose to participate in one or more national and/or regional QC programs, depending upon the range of tests it performs and the requirements of accreditation and regulatory agencies. Most of the accreditation agencies require participation in programs covering at least all of the routinely or frequently performed tests and, if available, also in those for infrequently performed tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Procedural/technical quality control in anatomic pathology differs very little from that practiced in the various sections of clinical pathology. Assessment of the quality of the final report is a major responsibility of the pathologist who renders the diagnosis. Guidelines that systematically address such issues as specimen handling and the content of the diagnostic report are effective in promoting consistency, completeness, and the clinical relevance of the information provided. Quality assessment of the pathologist's consultative role is more difficult to define and implement. However, systematic evaluation and correlative review of all available diagnostic information, appropriate use of consultation and case review, and participation in continuing education and self-assessment activities all may contribute to and help document the quality of services provided. It is important to emphasize the value of flexibility in designing a comprehensive quality assurance program for anatomic pathology. Departments differ markedly in characteristics such as staff size, subspecialty interests, teaching commitments, and volume and type of case material. Nevertheless, the general principles of written organization, systematic monitoring, and documentation of adherence to the program should be followed. Just as the design of the program may benefit from flexibility, the laboratory should be prepared to modify its quality control and assurance techniques and implement corrective measures should surveillance identify problems such as frequent typographic errors, inadequate diagnostic information, or deterioration in correlation between frozen section and final diagnoses. The ultimate objective of all of these efforts is to provide the referring physician with an accurate, clinically relevant diagnostic report, thereby enhancing the pathologist's role as a valued medical consultant.\r"

If PAC monitoring was still needed, a new catheter was either inserted over a guidewire at the initial insertion site or inserted at a new site. On removal, the catheter tip, introducer-sheath tip, and catheter within the shield were submitted for semiquantitative culture. Sixty-six catheters were initially inserted, and 26 were changed. No determinative differences in the time for venous cannulation were found, but the IJ route was slightly faster. In 3% of the catheterizations, serious complications arose. The infection rate was 2% for initial catheters, 8% for second catheters placed over a guidewire, and 15% for second catheters placed at a new site. These differences were not consequential. No local infection or catheter-related sepsis occurred. Thus, using a standard, sterile-insertion technique and a catheter-maintenance protocol yielded a low risk of insertion and infectious complications at either the IJ or SC site. Our data indicated that PACs can be changed safely over a guidewire at 72 h, avoiding further insertion risks without increasing infectious complications.\r"

Cardiac output, pulmonary and systemic arterial BP, blood gases, extravascular lung water, tidal volume, and airway pressure were measured serially in six control animals and six animals receiving increasing amounts of PEEP. There was no significant correlation between DO2 and CT in either group; however, animals receiving PEEP had less extravascular lung water.\r"

The study was double-blind, randomized, triple-crossover with each regimen given for two weeks. Holter monitoring was used during 48 consecutive hours in each period. Compared with placebo, addition of theophylline and enprofylline were associated with an increased mean hourly heart rate of 6 bpm (p less than 0.001). A small, but statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increase in mean hourly frequency of premature ventricular beats (PVBs) occurred with enprofylline as compared with placebo. However, in only two patients with enprofylline (and one patient with theophylline) the increase in PVBs was such that a clinically relevant proarrhythmic effect seems possible. Furthermore, ventricular tachycardia was not more frequently observed with any xanthine than with placebo. Thus, combined oral bronchodilator therapy is not contraindicated in patients with obstructive lung disease and concomitant ischemic heart disease. Holter monitoring is recommended to assess the individual patient's response to such therapy.\r"

Pulmonary specimens were obtained at surgery or immediately after death in 12 patients and were examined by light, immunofluorescent, and electron microscopy. Five of these 12 patients showed evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. In all of these five patients, infection with Legionella pneumophila was evidenced by bacteriologic methods, and other diseases known to cause fibrosis were excluded. The condition of four patients deteriorated rapidly with respiratory failure, and they died with pulmonary fibrosis. Only one patient finally recovered but was left with pulmonary sequelae. Two distinctive morphologic patterns were observed, one in which interstitial fibrosis was predominant and one in which intra-alveolar organization and fibrosis were also present. The alveolar epithelial lining and the basement membranes were disrupted in all patients, as evidenced by ultrastructural observations and by immunofluorescent studies showing gaps in the distribution of type 4 collagen and laminin. Types 1 and 3 collagen accumulated in areas corresponding to thickened interstitium and intra-alveolar fibrosis. Thus, some patients who survive the acute pneumonia of Legionnaires' disease may develop pulmonary fibrosis, and this process may lead to functional impairment or death despite prompt and appropriate treatment.\r"

In three patients with this disorder, evidence was obtained for elaboration of a lymphokine, leukocyte inhibitory factor (LIF), by peripheral blood lymphocytes after incubation with methotrexate (MTX) in the direct leukocyte migration inhibition test. Control lymphocytes from normal subjects, as well as from patients receiving methotrexate but without pneumonitis, failed to elaborate LIF in the presence of the drug in this test. Along with these results, we obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell data displaying high grade lymphocyte alveolitis with a lymphocyte subset inverted ratio. This production of LIF suggests that pneumonitis associated with methotrexate therapy is also associated with a specific cellular immune response to the drug.\r"

In triple rubber band ligation, all three primary hemorrhoids were ligated in a single session. After completion of treatment, the patients were examined every three months, or earlier if symptoms recurred. Both methods were effective in the treatment of early hemorrhoids and the incidence of postligation pain and complications was similar. The advantages of having the treatment completed at the initial visit in triple rubber band ligation are obvious. Furthermore, less treatment sessions were required for triple rubber band ligation to control symptoms than for conventional rubber band ligation. Triple rubber band ligation is more cost-effective and therefore is recommended.\r"

Nontraumatic myonecrosis becomes evident with localized pain, generalized toxicity, local signs of inflammation, and crepitation. Serum creatine kinase determinations may be of help in diagnosing patients suspected of having acute myonecrosis. Immediate heroic surgical intervention, usually with demonstration of Clostridium septicum, is mandatory to control the myonecrosis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is a valuable adjunct to surgical intervention, and penicillin in massive doses appears to be the agent of choice for the clostridia. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help in the optimal control. General supportive measures, including frequent blood transfusions, are most important. To save the life of the patient with nontraumatic, metastatic, clostridial myonecrosis, it is necessary, as soon as the patient's general condition permits, to diagnose and eliminate the cause of the myonecrosis. In addition to the case reported, 16 cases have been reported in the literature, making a total of 17. Five patients have survived (survival rate, 29 percent).\r"

Gallbladder volumes were measured by ultrasonography. Plasma CCK was determined by radioimmunoassay using region-specific antibodies; antibody 1703 binds to COOH-terminal CCK-peptides containing at least 14 amino acid residues, while antibody T204 binds to COOH-terminal CCK-peptides containing the sulfated tyrosine region. Plasma PP was also measured by radioimmunoassay. Ingestion of Vivonex induced significant increases in plasma CCK (0.6 +/- 0.1 to 4.6 +/- 0.6 pM, antibody 1703; 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 5.9 +/- 0.5 pM, antibody (T204; P less than or equal to 0.0005) and decreases in gallbladder volume (21.4 +/- 2.8 to 11.2 +/- 2.3 cm3; P = 0.0001). Integrated plasma CCK secretion and gallbladder contraction after Vivonex were not significantly different from the results found after corn oil. Both Vivonex and corn oil-induced small increases in plasma PP. We conclude that Vivonex is a potent stimulus for the secretion of CCK and contraction of the gallbladder.\r"

The sphincter of Oddi has an active role in coordinating the time and rate of secretion of biliopancreatic juice into the duodenum. In the opossum, the sphincter of Oddi exhibits spontaneous contractions that migrate distally along the sphincter and expels its contents into the duodenum. Although the motor activity of the sphincter of Oddi is independent from that of the duodenum, there is a correlation between the frequency of bursts of spike potentials in the sphincter of Oddi and the migrating motor complex phases in the duodenum. Abnormal motility of the sphincter of Oddi has been reported during endoscopic manometric evaluation of patients with choledocholithiasis and sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia. Patients with common bile duct stones have an increase in the frequency of retrograde propagation of phasic waves. Elevation of basal pressure as well as an increase in the frequency and amplitude of sphincter of Oddi phasic waves and the common bile duct-duodenum gradient pressure may occur in patients with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia. Endoscopic manometric studies of the sphincter of Oddi may become an important method to diagnose sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia.\r"

Blood samples (for LH-RH and LH determinations) were collected at frequent intervals from 10 minutes before to 60 or 90 minutes after injection. LH-RH peak levels varied, in a dose-dependent way, between 119 +/- 16 and 517 +/- 70 ng/l. Peak values were all reached between 1 and 3 minutes after injection, and elimination occurred rapidly, with half-lives between 2.6 +/- 0.4 and 5.2 +/- 1.0 minutes. The area under the curves increased significantly (P less than 0.01) if the doses of LH-RH had been augmented from 1 to 20 micrograms. Maximum LH values were reached more rapidly in the low-dose (1 and 2.5 micrograms) experiments (between 13.5 and 16.3 minutes), with an obvious decline afterwards. The area under the LH curves increased (P less than 0.01) if the doses of LH-RH had been elevated from 1 to 2.5 micrograms, but no further increase of LH release occurred (P greater than or equal to 0.21) if LH-RH doses were further elevated from 2.5 to 20 micrograms. The current study demonstrates that a 2.5-micrograms intravenous LH-RH dose is best suited for an adequate pituitary stimulation in normal men.\r"

The CSII group used regular insulin only, the MI group used 4-6 premeal injections of regular insulin and intermediate insulin at night, and the conventional group used two daily injections of combined regular and intermediate insulin. Only highly purified porcine insulin was used. Near normoglycemia was obtained during CSII and MI but not during conventional treatment. Antibodies against insulin were measured in serum samples by measuring the binding of iodinated porcine insulin to serum after removal of free and antibody-bound insulin from the samples by acid charcoal. The percent binding of 125I-labeled insulin increased significantly during MI and CSII, in contrast to conventional treatment. Nineteen patients had sufficient binding capacity for Scatchard analysis. In the CSII and MI groups, high- or low-affinity antibodies or both were induced. When insulin was administered subcutaneously during MI or CSII for 1 yr, the insulin antibody production increased, in contrast with conventional treatment.\r"

Continued binding of CCK8S to its receptor on the beta-cell and the increase in glucose metabolism noted with glucose stimulation are essential for the full expression of this response. This sensitization process may play an integral role in the postulated incretin effect of the peptide.\r"

Approximately 1 phosphate was incorporated per molecule of receptor, and the cAMP kinase's affinity for the receptor was at least as high as its affinity for histone. The sites phosphorylated by cAMP kinase seemed distinct from those phosphorylated by the protein kinase C. Phosphorylation by cAMP kinase had no effect on the ability of several monoclonal antibodies to recognize the receptor or on the insulin-binding activity of the receptor. However, cAMP phosphorylation partially inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor (approximately 25%). These results suggest that catecholamine-induced resistance to insulin may be partly due to a direct phosphorylation of the receptor by cAMP kinase and a subsequent inhibition of the ability of the receptor kinase to be activated by insulin.\r"

However, no relationship has been shown to exist between insulin degradation and the stimulation of glucose uptake. In this study we investigate the action of insulin on glucose uptake by the ability of this hormone to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose. The effect on alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake, which is known to be insulin sensitive, is also investigated. Cell-associated 125I-labeled insulin and trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -precipitable substances were measured in parallel. Chloroquine increased insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and alpha-aminoisobutyrate. Three hours were required for this effect to appear, and it did not depend on DNA synthesis. Chloroquine also increased cell-associated insulin and slightly decreased the percentage of trichloroacetic acid-soluble products. Methylamine affected neither nutrient uptake processes nor insulin binding and degradation; however, it did abolish the effect of chloroquine on these parameters. These data suggest that in chick embryo fibroblasts a relationship may exist between the increase in undegraded cell-associated insulin and the ability of the hormone to stimulate sugar and amino acid uptake.\r"

A critical assumption in the use of SRIF is that it has no effect on hepatic or peripheral glucose metabolism other than those mediated through the inhibition of hormone secretion. To assess whether doses of SRIF commonly used in human investigation have any effect on insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rates, we measured the rate in 6 normal subjects (mean fasting serum glucose level, 93 +/- 2 mg/dl) during euglycemic (approximately equal to 85 mg/dl) hyperinsulinemic (40 mU X m-2 X min-1) clamp studies both with and without the concomitant infusion of SRIF (600 micrograms/hr). The steady-state insulin levels achieved were 85 +/- 6 microU/ml and 74 +/- 8 microU/ml with and without SRIF, respectively (difference not significant). Glucose disposal rates between 120 and 180 min of the clamp were 7.11 +/- 0.10 and 7.35 +/- 0.10 mg X kg-1 X min-1 with and without SRIF, respectively (difference not significant). We concluded that in doses commonly used in human investigation, SRIF does not increase glucose disposal.\r"

  ".W": "GTP, in physiologic concentration, enhances the binding of cAMP to a protein in the hepatic cytosol that may be the regulatory subunit of protein kinase II. Ingestion of carbohydrate suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, two processes that are stimulated by cAMP. In this study, we have examined the possibility that carbohydrate inhibits these processes partly by decreasing the sensitivity of the GTP-responsive cAMP-binding protein to the effect of GTP. We found that 100 muM GTP was much less effective in enhancing cAMP binding in the hepatic cytosol of rats given 15% glucose for 2 days than in the cytosol of fasted rats [21 +/- 3% (mean +/- SE) increase vs. 67 +/- 6%, P less than .01]. Corresponding results were noted in diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose extracts of the hepatic cytosol of these rats. GTP stimulation of cAMP binding was also diminished in the hepatic cytosol of diabetic rats treated for 7 days with insulin compared with that of untreated diabetic rats (29 +/- 10 vs. 81 +/- 11% increase, P less than .01), but this could have been due to increased food intake in the treated rats. We conclude that GTP stimulation of hepatic cAMP binding is decreased in the carbohydrate-fed state and that this effect may be mediated by the increase in plasma insulin induced by carbohydrate. Our observations suggest that some of the cellular effects of cAMP may be regulated by modulation of the stimulatory effect of GTP on the GTP-responsive cAMP-binding protein.\r"

Hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia were evident 18 h after streptozocin injection, and significant hyperglucagonemia and acidosis were present at 36-48 h. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), expressed per unit of body weight, first increased at 3 days of diabetes [1.35 +/- 0.07 (SE) (N = 14)] and was 18% greater than in controls [1.14 +/- 0.03 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 (SE) (N = 38)] (P less than .005). Renal enlargement preceded GFR changes, so that GFR per unit of kidney weight was lower at 48 h in diabetics [1.31 +/- 0.06 (SE) (N = 16)] than in controls [1.54 +/- 0.04 ml X min-1 X g-1 (SE) (N = 38)] (P less than .01). Nucleotide and RNA metabolism was studied in the renal cortex after infusion of radio-labeled orotate or adenine. Rate of RNA synthesis, total cellular RNA, and the pools of ATP, UTP, and uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetyl glucosamine were significantly increased 13-51% in 48-h diabetics. Nucleotide precursor incorporation was significantly increased only in uracil ribonucleotides. The increase in uracil ribonucleotide pool exceeded the degree of cell hypertrophy. Our studies indicate that renal hypertrophy and specific increases in uracil ribonucleotide synthesis precede functional changes in early diabetes. Renal metabolic changes may be the critical primary factors in diabetic nephropathy.\r"

Our study was undertaken to determine whether there is a similar age-related pattern of sensitivity to the diabetogenic action of purified native human GH (hGH) in the obese (ob/ob) mouse. The ob/ob mouse was used because adults of this strain respond to chronic GH treatment with increases in fasting plasma insulin and blood glucose concentrations and with glucose intolerance. When hGH was given subcutaneously to adult (4-mo-old) female mice at doses of 5, 10, or 25 micrograms/day for 3 days, a significant increase in fasting blood glucose concentration and an impairment in glucose tolerance were produced by the 10-micrograms/day dose. Larger effects were obtained with the 25-micrograms/day dose. A threefold increase in fasting plasma insulin concentration was also produced with this dose of the hormone. By contrast, 25 micrograms/day of hGH had no effect on fasting plasma insulin, blood glucose, or glucose tolerance in 1-mo-old ob/ob mice. When a dose of 100 micrograms/day of hGH was given to 1-mo-old animals, a significant increase in fasting plasma insulin concentration occurred, but again there were no effects on fasting blood glucose or glucose tolerance. Mice 1.5 mo old showed marginal changes in fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance when given hGH at doses of 25 or 100 micrograms/day. Mice 9 or 12 mo old exhibited responsiveness similar to that of 4-mo-old animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty patients were randomized, by sealed envelope, to 6-h and 20 patients to 24-h postbiopsy bed rest. Nine patients (23%) had ultrasound-detected hematomas 1 day after liver biopsy (7 intrahepatic, 2 subcapsular). Five of these patients had been randomized to 6-h and 4 to 24-h bed rest. Follow-up ultrasound at 7 days in the 10 randomly selected patients failed to reveal any hematomas not seen on day 1 (n = 6) and showed complete or partial resolution of those that had been detected previously (n = 4). Significant drops in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increases in pulse rate were common postbiopsy findings, and were unrelated to hematoma formation. The results of this study indicate that intrahepatic and subcapsular hematomas are common after percutaneous liver biopsy. The length of postbiopsy bed rest (6 vs. 24 h) does not appear to influence the frequency of this complication.\r"

Initial studies demonstrated that 15 g of pectin was the optimal dose. Subsequently 6 healthy male volunteers were studied on 4 separate days at random. On day 1, gastric emptying of a liquid and a solid meal was assessed by radioisotope technique using 99mTc-dithiopropylthiomine. On day 2, the gastric emptying study was repeated with the addition of pectin to each meal. Plasma levels of glucose, insulin, and glucagon also were determined during these 2 days. On day 3, the effects of liquid and solid meals on gastroduodenal motility were assessed by means of a perfused catheter system. On day 4, the motility study was repeated with the addition of pectin to each meal. Pectin supplementation caused a significant prolongation of gastric emptying half-time of both liquid and solid meals (p less than 0.05). The addition of pectin, however, did not have any significant effect on gastroduodenal motility other than increasing the duodenal motility index 10 min after the liquid meal. The addition of pectin to the liquid meal lowered plasma levels of insulin at 15, 30, and 45 min, and glucagon levels 15 min after the meal. No effect was noted on blood sugar levels. On the other hand, the addition of pectin to the solid meal had no effect on plasma levels of glucose, insulin, and glucagon. We conclude that pectin supplementation delays gastric emptying of both liquid and solid meals in normal human subjects without causing notable changes in gastroduodenal motility or significant variations in pancreatic hormone plasma levels. The pectin effect on gastric emptying may be caused solely by increasing the viscosity of the meals.\r"

Despite a series of therapeutic maneuvers, cholestasis persisted but remained relatively stable over the ensuing 10 yr. However, serial liver biopsies revealed progressive biliary-type fibrosis culminating in cirrhosis. Subsequently, her clinical course deteriorated and she developed signs of hepatic failure, and ultimately died 10.5 yr after bone marrow transplantation. The evolution of chronic graft-versus-host disease to cirrhosis may be a limiting factor in the long-term survival of this group of bone marrow transplant recipients. The lack of correlation between the stable clinical or biochemical indices and the progressive hepatic disease underscores the need for sequential liver biopsies in patients with sustained liver function abnormalities after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

In preliminary experiments, which comprised 10 healthy volunteers treated with colectomy for ulcerative colitis, ileostomy fluid output increased (p less than 0.001) during oral intake of azodisal sodium (1 g/day). In a double blind, placebo controlled crossover study, comprising eight similar volunteers, ileostomy fluid output increased (p less than 0.05) in a dose related manner during intake of azodisal sodium (1 g/day vs 2 g/day) compared with placebo or sulphasalazine (2 g/day). Concentrations of prostaglandin (PG)F2 alpha in free ileal water determined by equilibrium in vivo dialysis of ileostomy contents decreased (p less than 0.05) during intake of azodisal sodium (2 g/day), whereas concentrations of PGE2 and the output of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and 'PGE2 + PGF2 alpha' remained unchanged. Thus increased formation of PGs is apparently not the cause of increased ileostomy fluid output associated with azodisalicylate intake.\r"

In the preliminary uncontrolled study 19 patients with grade 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy were given an intravenous solution containing leucine 11 g/l, isoleucine 9 g/l, and valine 8.4 g/l in 20% dextrose. A complete recovery of mental state was obtained in all patients in a mean time of 20.5 hours. In a subsequent controlled study 40 patients with grade 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy were randomly assigned to receive intravenous branched chain amino acid in 20% dextrose (group A) or oral lactulose (group B). Twelve patients (70.6%) in group A and eight (47%) in group B regained consciousness in a mean time of 27.6 and 31.5 hours, respectively. The difference in the recovery rate between the two groups, although evident, was not significant. Intravenous branched chain amino acids are thus at least as effective as lactulose in reversing hepatic coma. These data argue strongly in favour of a therapeutic effect of branched chain amino acids in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with chronic liver failure.\r"

  ".W": "Major loss of body protein mass in inflammatory bowel disease is much less common than weight loss, which is often attributable to losses of other body, particularly water and fat. It does occur, however, in a few patients, especially in those with compromised food intake. It is due principally to the combined effects of diminished intake and excessive intestinal losses of amino nitrogen. Nitrogen metabolism is influenced not only by protein nutritional state and net nitrogen intake but also by disease activity. There is some evidence for abnormally low secretion of growth hormone in adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease and growth failure. Low serum albumin concentrations are not necessarily related to protein undernutrition and are the combined result of relatively reduced albumin synthesis, increased intestinal losses, and maldistribution between intravascular and extravascular spaces. Concentrations in the plasma of IgG and acute phase reactants may be raised despite increased losses into the bowel lumen. The prevention of total body protein depletion is achieved principally by maintaining adequate and often not supranormal intakes of a balanced source of amino nitrogen in a balanced diet given orally, enterally, or parenterally, combined with a medical or surgical approach to reduce disease activity: supranormal energy intakes are not beneficial.\r"

The effects of disease severity and those of solutions containing 0%, 16%, 35%, 53%, and 100% branched chain amino acids were evaluated. Significant increases in protein synthesis were noted with solutions containing 35%, 53%, and 100% branched chain amino acids, but in patients receiving 100% branched chain amino acids without additional essential amino acid supplement the increase in synthesis was matched by a significant increase in protein breakdown. Protein balance was thus improved only in patients receiving 35% and 53% branched chain amino acids. It was concluded that the high increase in protein breakdown in patients receiving 100% branched chain amino acids was undesirable, and such a solution should not be recommended for clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a prospective, randomized single-blind trial of propranolol for the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding. Seventy-nine patients shown to have variceal hemorrhage at endoscopy were included in the study within 72 hr following diagnosis. Fifty-seven patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, 10 cryptogenic cirrhosis, 6 posthepatitic cirrhosis, 4 biliary cirrhosis, 1 portal vein thrombosis without cirrhosis and 1 idiopathic portal hypertension. The severity of liver disease at inclusion was assessed according to the Pugh modification of the Child-Turcotte classification: 9 (11%) had Class A; 41 (52%) Class B, and 29 (37%) Class C disease. Patients were randomly assigned by sealed envelope to the propranolol group (42 patients) or the placebo group (37 patients). Propranolol dosage was titrated in order to produce plasma concentrations of propranolol of 50 to 150 ng per ml. beta-blockade was also confirmed by isoproterenol testing. The cumulative percentages of patients free of rebleeding 1 and 2 years after inclusion were 31 and 21% in the propranolol group, and 25 and 17% in the placebo group; both differences were not significant. Cumulative 1 and 2 years survival were also comparable: 64 and 54% in the propranolol group vs. 70 and 63% in the placebo group. There was no evidence for a therapeutic effect of propranolol after adjusting for potential confounding variables by multiple logistic regression. We conclude that propranolol is not effective for the prevention of variceal rebleeding, when administered early following the initial bleed, in cirrhotics unselected with respect to the severity of the liver disease.\r"

The hemodynamic effects of beta-blocking agents and vasodilatory drugs were noninvasively measured in eight patients with cirrhosis by means of pulsed echo-doppler equipment. Portal caliber, blood velocity and flow were recorded hourly after a single dose of propranolol (40 mg p.o.) or atenolol (100 mg p.o.), and every 5 min after treatment with isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg sublingually). The drugs were administered at random with an interval of 2 days or more. The portal caliber decreased after atenolol, but did not change after propranolol and isosorbide. The blood velocity decreased by 29 +/- 2% 3 hr after propranolol, by 26 +/- 2% 3 hr after atenolol and by 31 +/- 3% 15 min after isosorbide. The portal blood flow decreased by 0.29 +/- 0.03 liters per min after propranolol, by 0.34 +/- 0.06 after atenolol and by 0.26 +/- 0.03 after isosorbide, without any difference among the various treatments. beta-blockers and vasodilatory drugs have comparable effects on portal blood flow. beta 1-selective and nonselective beta-blockers are similarly effective in keeping with the hypothesis that changes in portal blood flow are mainly due to the block of beta 1-receptors.\r"

Sixteen of 20 prednisone-treated patients who were initially serum hepatitis B virus DNA-positive had a transient elevation of their serum ALT activity on withdrawal of prednisone. Subsequently, 14 of these 16 patients (87.5%) became persistently negative for serum hepatitis B virus DNA, and 10 also lost their HBeAg. In addition, there was a significant fall in serum ALT levels and HBsAg titers up to 12 months of follow-up in the prednisone-treated group. Five of 20 (25%) prednisone-treated patients experienced a transient episode of hepatic decompensation coinciding with the peak of enzyme elevation. To contrast, only 3 of 15 (20%) initially hepatitis B virus DNA-positive matched untreated patients followed during the same time period became negative for serum hepatitis B virus DNA, and no significant changes in serum ALT values or HBsAg titers were noted over the 12-month study period. Thus, patients with chronic active hepatitis B appear to be responsive to immunologic manipulation with prednisone as indicated by a pronounced rebound immune response and clearance of hepatitis B virus DNA with improvement in liver disease activity.\r"

It has previously been reported that regenerating liver cytosol is able to prevent, at least in part, the lethal effect of this substance by stimulating hepatic regeneration. Recently, we have separated a fraction using alcohol precipitation (80%) from regenerating liver cytosol and from weanling rat liver cytosol prepared in acetate buffer (100 mM, pH 6.5). We named this fraction hepatic stimulatory substance because of its ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in vivo when injected intraperitoneally in 40% hepatectomized rats and in vitro in the presence of hepatocytes isolated and maintained in monolayer cultures. The stimulatory activity of the hepatic stimulatory substance is fully evident in subfractions of molecular weight up to 300,000 and 50,000 daltons of the crude material obtained using Amicon Ultra membrane filters. The present report describes the ability of hepatic stimulatory substance and its subfractions to stimulate hepatocyte proliferation and the application of these hepatic extracts in successfully reversing the lethality of D-galactosamine-induced hepatic necrosis in rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of both of these agents on albumin synthesis and secretion, and to see if ethanol inhibition could be related to an osmotic effect. Male, fed rabbits served as liver donors in all studies. There were a total of 35 studies: 13 control; 10 ethanol (39 to 52 mM); 4 cycloheximide (0.5 mM), and 8 sucrose (1%). Plasma volume was measured with 125I-albumin (human) and extracellular volume measured with either 99mTc diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid or [14C]sucrose. During perfusion, rabbit albumin content in the perfusate was measured immunologically every 15 to 30 min for 225 min. Interstitial albumin efflux was measured by the rate of appearance in the perfusate of 125I-albumin given to 10 other rabbits 3 days prior to hepatic removal and perfusion. During the initial 75 min of perfusion, 74% of the in vivo equilibrated exchangeable 125I-albumin appeared in the perfusate, and during this period the rabbit albumin that entered the perfusate was taken to represent efflux from the interstitial volume plus synthesis. Rabbit albumin appearing in the perfusate during the later period of 150 min was taken to represent mainly synthesis and was used to calculate the amount of albumin that would be synthesized in 75 min. The difference between these two values would be hepatic interstitial albumin appearing in the perfusate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two monoclonal antibodies recognizing antigens present only on human hepatoma cell lines were investigated. The monoclonal antibody IB1 was found to react with 3 of 9 hepatoma cell lines. Monoclonal antibody 9B2 reacted with all nine hepatoma cell lines. None of the other 20 cell lines tested was bound by IB1 and 9B2. The immunoperoxidase staining of monoclonal antibodies on frozen sections of paired hepatoma and normal liver tissues from the same individuals were studied. Antibody IB1 reacted with 3 of 13 hepatoma tissues, but with none of the normal liver and other tissues, and antibody 9B2 was reactive with antigens appearing on the bile canalicular domain of hepatoma and normal liver tissues. The antibody 9B2 stained no normal tissues with the exception of proximal tubules of kidney. Radioimmunoprecipitation tests identified two antigens reacting with 9B2. The major antigen had an apparent molecular weight of 140,000 and a minor one of 130,000. Therefore, antibody IB1 seems to be specific for antigens present on a group of human hepatoma cells and may be useful for classification and diagnosis of human hepatomas. Antibody 9B2 is quite specific to human liver cells and may be used to provide clues for the characterization of tumor cell lines, identification of metastatic tumors with hepatocytic origin, and study of the structure and function of bile canaliculi.\r"

Enzyme kinetic studies indicated that U-71038 was a competitive inhibitor of hog renin with an inhibitor constant (Ki) value of 12 nM. Intravenous as well as oral administration of U-71038 to anesthetized, ganglion-blocked rats infused with hog renin elicited dose-related hypotensive responses. Intravenous administration of U-71038 to conscious, sodium-depleted monkeys caused dose-related decreases of blood pressure and plasma renin activity without affecting heart rate. Similarly, the oral administration of U-71038 at 50 mg/kg to conscious, sodium-depleted monkeys elicited a pronounced hypotension and decrease in plasma renin activity that persisted for 5 hours. The hypotensive responses elicited by intravenous and oral administration of U-71038 to hog renin-infused rats and sodium-depleted monkeys were shown to be due entirely to inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. A comparison of the results obtained after the intravenous administration of U-71038 with the results obtained after the oral administration of U-71038 implied that at least 10% of the orally administered U-71038 must have been absorbed to cause the observed effects in hog renin-infused rats and sodium-depleted monkeys. The studies demonstrated that an inhibitor of renin with a long duration of action and with oral effectiveness is a feasible entity.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of antihypertensive drug treatment on aortic DNA synthesis was examined in rats with two-kidney, one clip renal hypertension and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In two-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats, hypertension developed over a 2-week period. Four days after clipping the renal artery, during the onset of hypertension, there was an increase in aortic DNA synthesis. Aortic DNA synthesis was also increased 3 weeks later, when hypertension had been established. Captopril, hydralazine, and verapamil were each able to prevent the increase in aortic DNA synthesis and the rise in blood pressure when given throughout the first 5 days of the developing phase of hypertension, or when given to rats with established hypertension. Drug treatment of sham-operated rats had no significant effect on DNA synthesis, although blood pressure was decreased. There were no differences in blood pressure or aortic DNA synthesis in 4-week-old SHR, as compared with age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls or normal Wistar rats. At 17 weeks of age, when hypertension was established, aortic DNA synthesis was significantly enhanced in the SHR. Captopril or hydralazine treatment was able to reduce blood pressure and DNA synthesis to levels seen in the WKY. At 21 weeks of age, DNA synthesis in the SHR had declined to the same levels as in the WKY. Captopril, hydralazine, and verapamil may have a common ability to reduce intracellular calcium and therefore inhibit DNA synthesis. In support of this, ouabain treatment, which increases intracellular calcium by inhibiting the Na+-K+ pump, produced a significant increase in the rate of DNA synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We previously showed that adrenal renin is highest in the rat zona glomerulosa (ZG) and that low sodium or high potassium and nephrectomy increase adrenal ZG renin and aldosterone. Dahl salt-sensitive rats (S) have been shown to have lower plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone and higher plasma 18-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone than Dahl salt-resistant rats (R). In this study we assess the possible role of adrenal ZG renin in the suppression of aldosterone in S rats. Adrenal ZG renin was significantly decreased in S as compared with R rats even at 6 weeks of age, when both S and R rats are still normotensive (S = 7.2 +/- 0.2, R = 18.0 +/- 1.6 ng angiotensin I/mg protein/hr). Adrenal ZG aldosterone was also significantly lower in S than in R rats (S = 21.1 +/- 4.3, R = 39.5 +/- 3.6 ng/mg protein). Furthermore, the rise in adrenal ZG renin and aldosterone after nephrectomy in S rats was significantly less than that in R rats. To determine if the suppressed adrenal ZG renin of S rats is due to volume expansion, we studied the effect of a sodium-deficient diet on adrenal ZG renin in S and R rats. After 2 weeks of a sodium-deficient diet S rats had significantly lower basal adrenal ZG renin than did R rats (S = 7.6 +/- 0.4, R = 21.7 +/- 1.9 ng angiotensin I/mg protein/hr) and a marked blunting of the adrenal ZG renin response to nephrectomy (S = 13.6 +/- 1.1, DR = 167 +/- 16.1 ng angiotensin I/mg protein/hr).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute oral administration of the drug caused a significant reduction in blood pressure associated with an increase in heart rate mediated by the sinoaortic baroreceptor-heart rate reflex. After 1 week of treatment reflex resetting had occurred, returning heart rate to normal despite continuing blood pressure reduction. This effect was maintained throughout 6 weeks of treatment. Withdrawal of treatment was followed by return of the blood pressure to control levels associated with significant bradycardia caused by reflex reactivation at its reset level. No change was observed in response to tilting or Valsalva's maneuver or in plasma renin activity. Ambulatory intra-arterial data suggested that the clinically useful antihypertensive action of felodipine persists for 9 hours.\r"

Patients with signs or symptoms of cerebral ischemia are likely to have abnormal cerebrovascular dynamics, with areas of cerebrum at risk, and may be at an increased risk of stroke after general or vascular surgery. Such patients also have a very high frequency of associated cardiac disease. In this chapter, guidelines for anesthetic management of patients with symptomatic CVD undergoing noncardiac surgery were based on current understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Nonetheless, the available data indicate that most perioperative strokes occur in the postoperative period and appear to be thromboembolic in nature. The existence of neither asymptomatic carotid bruits nor intraoperative hypotension appears to be associated with the occurrence of perioperative stroke.\r"

In the event of unexpected awareness, the anesthesiologist must deal with the patient in an honest and forthright manner. Failure to do so may lead to dire psychological consequences for the patient and legal consequences for the anesthesiologist.\r"

The grafts were divided into 1) bare cartilage, 2) perichondrium, 3) cartilage covered with perichondrium on one side, and 4) cartilage covered with perichondrium on both sides. The grafts were measured in length and weight before transplantation, and at 2 and 4 months after transplantation; they were compared to a control piece of cartilage tagged in situ. Histologic examination was performed on all retrieved grafts. Transplanted cartilage survival was good in over 75% of cases; however, cartilage production from perichondrium was minimal and no growth was noticed in any of the grafts.\r"

  ".W": "Different antigenic determinants on thyroid microsomal antigen (MAg) could induce different antibodies, which, in turn, could have differing importance in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease. In this study we demonstrated three types of microsomal antibodies (MAbs) present in serum of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease by Western blot analysis. These MAbs reacted with native, denatured, and denatured and reduced MAg. Methods for detecting the MAbs were developed, and the clinical significance of these Abs was analyzed in 197 patients with thyroid disorders. For measurement of Ab against native and denatured MAg, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in which wells were coated with untreated or sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured MAg, was used. For measurement of Ab against denatured and reduced MAg, 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis was used. Native MAb enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay values correlated highly with microsomal hemagglutination titers, but patients with high titers of Ab against native MAg did not necessarily have Ab against denatured MAg or reduced MAg. Abs against denatured MAg or denatured and reduced MAg were found in patients with Hashimoto's disease (28.8% and 13.6%) and Graves' disease (22.4% and 11.2%). The percentage of patients with positive denatured and reduced MAb was higher in Graves' disease patients who had a longer sick interval or who developed hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment. This study provides the first clear demonstration that MAbs are heterogeneous. The data suggest that antibodies against denatured or denatured and reduced MAg may be related to destruction of the thyroid gland.\r"

  ".W": "A binding assay was developed to measure the estrogen receptor (ER)-binding activity in serum. The method employed immunoglobulin G (IgG) adsorption with protein A-bearing Staphylococcus aureus cells before incubation with tritium-labeled ER. Specificity studies employing chromatographic and electrophoretic analyses suggested that an IgG antibody (Anti-ER) was responsible for the serum activity. Anti-ER was found in human, rat, and mouse serum and exhibited species cross-reactivity. The antibody recognized both the 8S and 5S forms of the ER. Anti-ER was measured in 262 individuals ranging in age from 1-85 yr. The antibody was detected in all serum samples examined, suggesting its natural occurrence. When the study group was divided into three arbitrary age groups (young, 1-13 yr; middle age, 13-51 yr; older, greater than 51 yr), significant differences in levels of antibody were found, with highest levels in the young, followed by the elderly, and lowest levels in the middle years. An examination of sex- as well as age-related differences in the population revealed a striking sex difference. Thus, the young male population had a lower level of antibody than the corresponding female population, and these levels in males declined throughout life to reach their lowest point in old age, whereas the high levels in young females declined in middle years and then increased significantly in the elderly. We postulate that the antibody is a subgroup of IgG of multifactorial etiology. The idiotypic network theory offers an explanation for the occurrence of these antibodies in normal serum, whereas an autoimmune mechanism could account for the secondary rise of anti-ER in the aging female population.\r"
