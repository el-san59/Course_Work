The group receiving the educational package had better scores than a control group on outcomes of willingness to treat persons with AIDS; identification of human immunodeficiency virus lesions; knowledge of AIDS; and completeness of both intraoral and extraoral examinations. It was concluded that intervention is one approach to increasing dentists' positive response to the AIDS epidemic.\r"

In contrast, hemagglutinin protein was seen only occasionally, and no membrane and fusion proteins were found in any of the sections studied. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) specific for these five viral proteins were detected in all brain extracts examined; however, the mRNAs for the envelope proteins were clearly underrepresented in comparison with lytically infected cells. Only the mRNAs for N and P proteins appeared active in in vitro translations. These findings indicate quantitative differences in the pattern of mRNA expression in brain tissue and a restricted expression of MV envelope proteins in infected cells as observed in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.\r"

Cultured cardiac myocytes (CMCs) were incubated for 24 hours with 35 microCi sulfur 35-labeled methionine and 10(-10) to 10(-5) mol/L doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin) (ADR), daunomycin (DM), 5-iminodaunorubicin IDR), or 3'-deamino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin (MRA-CN). CMCs were harvested in buffered Triton X-100 and homogenized. Proteins in the extracts were fractionated by centrifugation. Equal protein quantities were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, to two-dimensional electrophoresis, and to autoradiography. AAs caused a dose-dependent decrease in radiolabeling of CMC proteins in Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions of the extracts. ADR and DM (10(-6) mol/L each) and IDR (10(-5) mol/L) decreased radiolabeling of CMC polypeptides including alpha-actin. In polypeptides extracted in the Triton X-100-soluble pool, the effect on CMC alpha-actin synthesis was greater than the effect on beta- or gamma-actin. CMC alpha-actin synthesis was susceptible to ADR and to DM in a dose-dependent fashion. Contrastingly, alpha-actin radiolabeling was not altered by exposing CMCs to 10(-5) mol/L MRA-CN. Decreased sarcomeric actin isoform synthesis in vitro may reflect forms of subcellular damage in this model of anthracycline cardiomyopathy.\r"

Gamma camera scintigraphy and dissection/radiometric biodistribution studies indicated that: (a) tumors and metastases took up 5-6% of the injected dose/g except when large necrotic areas were present in the primary tumor; (b) blood levels of 67Ga increased in all tumor-bearing animals, with up to tenfold increases in the i.m. tumor model at later stages of the growth; (c) hepatic uptake increased as a function of tumor size/age, and (d) all tissue:blood ratios declined as the neoplastic tissues progressed. The results are discussed with respect to tumor progression and metastatic disease.\r"

Fifteen patients each had three preoperatively customized blocks placed. They were then examined clinically and radiographically for at least 2 years. Six patients had skin-graft vestibuloplasties performed over the blocks 3 months after implantation; dentures were made for 11 of the patients. No clinical or radiographic evidence of migration or resorption of the blocks was found; however, all 15 patients suffered complications. Eleven developed ulcerations over the blocks with persistent exposure, six had suture line dehiscence leading to exposure, two infections occurred, and two patients developed chronic pain in the area of block insertion. The skin graft took only partially in all patients undergoing subsequent vestibuloplasties. To date, 37 of the original 45 blocks have required complete removal. Histologic examination of removed blocks has revealed partial filling of the pores with lamellar bone. The use of blocks of porous hydroxylapatite to reconstruct atrophic residual mandibular ridges was found to have an unacceptably high rate of failure and the ability to sustain an overlying split-thickness skin graft was unpredictable.\r"

Primary tumor/regional failure and distant metastasis adversely affected prognosis. Patients had an actuarial 2-year NED of 80% when the dose to the primary tumor/upper neck was greater than or equal to 60 Gy but was 53% when the dose was less than 60 Gy. Two-year NED was 85% in those patients given greater than 50 Gy to the lower neck and 62% when less than or equal to 50 Gy was used. Based on these results, a total dose of at least 60 Gy to the primary tumor bed and upper neck and greater than 50 Gy to the lower neck whenever adjuvant postoperative irradiation is administered for subclinical disease is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "The botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) is a rare cyst of odontogenic origin originally described in 1973 by Weathers and Waldron as a variant of the lateral periodontal cyst. Ten examples of this rare lesion were studied by light and electron microscopy and the clinical and radiographic findings were analyzed. Eight of ten lesions were located in the mandible; the anterior mandible being the dominant site. Five of the ten lesions were unilocular, the largest measuring 4.5 X 1.2 cm. Only two of the ten botryoid odontogenic cysts were radiographically multilocular. Three lesions represented recurrences 8, 10, and 10 years after previous surgical intervention. All patients were white with an average age of 46 years. Perhaps the most significant information gained from this investigation of botryoid odontogenic cysts is the fact three of ten lesions recurred after initial surgical removal. It is important that practitioners take note of the fact that: 1) a recurrence potential may exist for the botryoid odontogenic cyst that has gone unrecognized, 2) recurrence may not occur until a decade after initial surgery, and 3) lesions may occasionally become destructive.\r"

After 3 months, histologic evaluation demonstrated that fibrocartilage thickness was greatest in the discectomy-coarse diet operated joint, less in the discectomy-ground diet operated joint, still less in the discectomy-coarse diet unoperated joint, and unaffected in the control animals. The results of this study demonstrate that diet texture can affect TMJ healing following discectomy.

Neither the hydroxylapatite or the tricalcium phosphate induced bony healing in the defect, and the addition of collagen did not interfere with healing. Because collagen does not alter healing, it might be possible to use it as biocompatible resorbable binder to confine particulate ceramic implants and inhibit their migration.\r"

Cumulative concentration-response effects of agonist A were obtained in the absence and presence of steady-state contractions induced by agonist B. The agonists examined included histamine, prostaglandin D2, platelet activating factor, leukotrienes E4 and D4 and carbamylcholine. We found that none of the agonists studied caused a leftward shift in the concentration-response curve of a second agonist, nor did any agonist decrease the concentration of a second agonist required to evoke a maximum response. In general the functional interactions fit the predictions based on the early models of functional additivity. However, the interactions deviated categorically from this model in that there was less than predicted additivity at concentrations of the interactants that alone induced greater than a 50% response. The degree to which this deviation occurred was agonist dependent. The results suggest that in the guinea pig trachea a contractile agonist does not uncover or increase a reserve in the receptor-subeffect-response chain of a second contractile agonist. The findings that the quantitative nature of the interactions were somewhat agonist dependent supports the hypothesis that more than one biochemical mechanism is involved in the receptor-mediated contraction of airway smooth muscle.\r"

The response lasted for several more minutes in the continued presence of LR. It consisted of (a) moderate-conductance (50 pS), cation-selective, ion-channel activity, (b) a shift of the zero-current membrane potential close to 0 mV, and (c) a suppression of a depolarization-activated K+ conductance. All of these changes in tumor cell excitability act coordinately to depolarize the tumor cells and may be important in the cytostatic actions of LR.\r"

  ".W": "In the Helsinki Heart Study, a randomized five-year, double-blind trial, a 34% reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was observed in dyslipidemic men treated with gemfibrozil. Averaged over the five years of the trial, gemfibrozil therapy produced, compared with placebo, mean decreases of 10% in serum total cholesterol level, 14% in non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, 11% in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, 35% in triglyceride level, and a mean increase of 11% in HDL cholesterol level from baseline levels measured prior to treatment. While changes in HDL cholesterol level were similar in all Fredrickson types, the effect on concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol was largest in type IIA and on LDL minimal in type IV. The reduction of CHD incidence over placebo was largest in type IIB and smallest in type IIA. The lipid changes were dependent on lipid levels prior to treatment and on compliance with the medication regimen. When risk factors for CHD, including age, blood pressure, smoking and drinking habits, baseline lipid levels, and exercise and relative weight, were controlled by applying the Cox proportional hazards model, the changes in serum HDL and LDL cholesterol levels were both statistically significantly associated with the decline in CHD incidence within the gemfibrozil-treated group. The large decrease in serum triglyceride levels had relatively small effect on CHD incidence. Thus, the results of this study, together with earlier observations, suggest that both elevating HDL and lowering LDL cholesterol levels are effective in the primary prevention of CHD.\r"

  ".W": "Type beta transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), a factor produced by many cell types, is a potent inhibitor of hepatocyte DNA synthesis in vitro. To determine whether TGF-beta can influence hepatocyte proliferation in vivo, its effects were examined on the regenerative response of liver to partial hepatectomy (PH) in the rat. Porcine platelet-derived TGF-beta 1 (0.5 micrograms), administered intravenously at the time of PH and 11 hr later, reduced the fraction of hepatocytes engaged in DNA synthesis 22 hr after PH by 67% and inhibited the rate of hepatic [3H]thymidine incorporation by 50%. TGF-beta 2 produced a similar effect. A single dose of 0.5 micrograms of TGF-beta 1 given 11 hr after PH reduced liver [3H]thymidine incorporation by 32%; 4.5 micrograms of TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2 inhibited DNA synthesis by 88% and the labeling index by 86%. Although sensitive to TGF-beta administered 11 hr after PH, late in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, a single dose of 0.5 micrograms given at the time of PH did not significantly influence DNA synthesis 22 hr after PH. The inhibitory effects of TGF-beta were transient; rats treated with two 0.5-microgram doses of TGF-beta at 0 and 11 hr had completely restored their original liver DNA mass 8 days after PH. Administration of 0.5 microgram of either TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2 every 12 hr for 5 days failed to suppress the recovery of hepatic DNA mass. However, the nuclear labeling index of the TGF-beta-treated animals was significantly higher than that of the controls. There was no evidence of cytotoxicity from TGF-beta, as determined by liver histology and plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin-like growth factor I, and two hepatic enzymes. Thus, TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 reversibly inhibit the proliferative response of liver to PH and may be important in the modulation of normal liver growth and repair.\r"

  ".W": "Two aromatic polycyclic diones hypericin and pseudohypericin have potent antiretroviral activity; these substances occur in plants of the Hypericum family. Both compounds are highly effective in preventing viral-induced manifestations that follow infections with a variety of retroviruses in vivo and in vitro. Pseudohypericin and hypericin probably interfere with viral infection and/or spread by direct inactivation of the virus or by preventing virus shedding, budding, or assembly at the cell membrane. These compounds have no apparent activity against the transcription, translation, or transport of viral proteins to the cell membrane and also no direct effect on the polymerase. This property distinguishes their mode of action from that of the major antiretro-virus group of nucleoside analogues. Hypericin and pseudohypericin have low in vitro cytotoxic activity at concentrations sufficient to produce dramatic antiviral effects in murine tissue culture model systems that use radiation leukemia and Friend viruses. Administration of these compounds to mice at the low doses sufficient to prevent retroviral-induced disease appears devoid of undesirable side effects. This lack of toxicity at therapeutic doses extends to humans, as these compounds have been tested in patients as antidepressants with apparent salutary effects. Our observations to date suggest that pseudohypericin and hypericin could become therapeutic tools against retroviral-induced diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

At the time of study, the mean height was -1.5 SD score below the mean, less than genetic potential, and significantly less than the mean pretreatment height of -0.25 SD score. Height velocity was subnormal for age and sexual stage in all patients. Two patients had compensated hypothyroidism, and four had evidence of gonadal failure. In 11 patients, the peak GH level after two provocative tests was below 10 micrograms/L, which was consistent with GH deficiency. In ten of 13 patients tested, spontaneous GH secretion determined by a 24-hour GH concentration (GHC), GH pulse amplitude, frequency of GH pulses greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/L, and GH peak during wake and sleep hours was significantly less than in normal height controls. Although in three pubertal patients the 24-hour GHC was within normal limits, the GHC during sleep hours, GH pulse amplitude during 24 hours and sleep hours, and peak GH during wake hours were significantly less than in normal height controls. In all pubertal and in two of the prepubertal patients, the somatomedin C (SmC) level was significantly less than in controls. The 24-hour GHC correlated well with the GHC during sleep, peak-stimulated GH level, gonadal steroid level, and the SmC level, but not with height velocity, dose of radiation, or age at radiation. A significant increase in height velocity and the SmC level was noted in all patients treated with GH. These results indicate that GH deficiency occurs after 18 to 24 Gy of cranial radiation and that the puberty-associated growth spurt may mask the decline in height velocity owing to GH deficiency. In some patients treated with cranial radiation, a subtle dysregulation in spontaneous GH secretion may exist despite a normal GH response to provocative testing.\r"

Thirty pregnant women with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension and a low Bishop score were studied in three equal groups. Group 1 received prostaglandin A1 infusions alone (0.5 microgram/kg/min for a maximum of 24 hours). Group 2 had received initial priming by prostaglandin E2 vaginal gel 6 hours before the onset of the prostaglandin A1 infusion, and group 3 was treated by conventional therapy and oxytocin induction. In the first two groups blood pressure was reduced to normotensive values, and labor was induced satisfactorily in 15 of the 20 cases, but four patients in group 1 were delivered within 24 hours after infusion. Group 2 offered the most favorable results because 80% were delivered during the infusion; thus the postinfusion rebound rise in blood pressure was avoided. Group 3 presented the least acceptable results, with the highest failure rate and an increased number of operative deliveries.\r"

Albino rabbits received intrastromal injections of 5 x 10(2) organisms of an aminoglycoside-resistant strain of P. aeruginosa. At five hours postinoculation, imipenem (5 mg/ml) therapy was initiated using one drop per 30 minutes for 12 hours. Corneal tissue was then excised for colony forming unit counts. Imipenem was highly effective in reducing colony forming unit counts to zero in comparison to 4.1 x 10(5) organisms for untreated controls. A second regimen beginning 24 hours postinoculation of one drop per hour for 24 hours was also successful in significantly reducing colony forming units vs controls (P less than .05). These data suggest that topical imipenem may have clinical applicability in the treatment of P. aeruginosa keratitis.\r"

Lomefloxacin inhibited 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was equal in activity to norfloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but was twofold less active against Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Ofloxacin was generally 2- to 4-fold more active, and ciprofloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more active. Lomefloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but MICs for 90% of streptococcal species tested were 8 micrograms/ml. In the presence of 9 mM Mg2+, MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. A single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the MIC occurred at a frequency of less than 10(-10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced MIC increases. Lomefloxacin had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones.\r"

Cefotiam (I g) and sulbenicillin (2 g) were administered intravenously before and after ursodeoxycholate administration, and the maximum concentrations of the antibiotics in the bile and total amounts excreted in the bile during the 4 h after administration were determined. After ursodeoxycholate administration, both the maximum concentration of cefotiam in the bile and the amount excreted increased significantly. Ursodeoxycholate also increased the peak concentration and total excretion of sulbenicillin. For both cefotiam and sulbenicillin, the amount of antibiotic excreted in the bile during the 4 h after administration showed a significant correlation with the amount of bile acids excreted in the bile. This strongly suggests a common mechanism for the biliary excretion of these antibiotics and bile acids. Ursodeoxycholate administration is a benign way to increase both the concentration and the total amount of antibiotic excreted in the bile. Therefore, it may be useful in the treatment of serious biliary tract infections, especially in patients receiving biliary drainage.\r"

In this study, intrathecal IgG synthesis was investigated using several techniques in patients with different stages of HIV infection and then correlated with the state of the blood-brain barrier. Almost all patients had specific anti-HIV IgG synthesis within the CNS, suggesting the presence of HIV in the brain. These findings further stress that direct CNS infection occurs early in the course of systemic virus spread.\r"

The 36 included 9 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 27 non-AIDS (7 AIDS-related complex (ARC); 4 other HIV class IV, 16 asymptomatic) patients. The development of AIDS was preceded 1-4 years by loss or lack of antibody to gag (p15, 24, or 55) and/or to pol (p31, 53, or 64), each p less than 0.001, compared with non-AIDS patients.

Eight patients died during remission induction, and 11 had resistant disease. The median survival was 14 weeks for the total population, and 24 weeks for patients achieving a complete remission. The nonmyelosuppressive toxicity of the combination was acceptable; serious neurologic and pulmonary toxicities were uncommon. Significant marrow hypoplasia was observed resulting in a high incidence of febrile episodes (85% of patients). The combination of mitoxantrone and high-dose cytosine arabinoside did not significantly improve overall prognosis.

Overall 16 patients (36%) had a complete remission; 16 patients (36%) had resistant disease; and 12 (27%) died during induction therapy. The most significant predictive factor for remission was the duration of first remission: the response rate was 17% for patients whose first remission duration was shorter than 12 months (including those who did not achieve a first remission), 45% for those with a first remission lasting between 12 to 18 months, and 69% for those with longer remission durations (P = 0.008). Other predictive factors for higher response rates were a younger age group, a good performance status, and a favorable or diploid karyotype. The median survival from start of therapy was 4 months for the total population and 10 months for patients with remission. Serious side effects including pulmonary toxicity and neurotoxicity occurred in less than 10% of patients. This incidence was significantly lower than previous high-dose cytosine arabinoside schedules of 3 g/m2 for nine to 12 doses (total dose, 27 to 36 g per course). Significant granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were universal resulting in fever or documented infections in 98% of patients. We conclude that the combination of high-dose cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone is an effective antileukemic regimen with acceptable toxicity. Future studies should incorporate it as part of the frontline induction or maintenance strategies in newly diagnosed patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.\r"

Although uncommon, recently the authors have encountered six cases of this neoplasm, in each of which the soft tissue component was devoid of bone elements and was microscopically indistinguishable from MFH of bone or soft tissue. Neoplastic osteoid and woven bone were present in the osseous component of each tumor, however. Radiologically, the lesions generally were osteoblastic but focally osteolytic with features typical of osteogenic sarcoma. Pain was the most common presenting symptom. There was no age or sex predilection. Immunocytochemical staining showed strong positivity with alpha-1-antichymotrypsin within malignant bizarre giant cells and occasional neoplastic osteoblasts in five cases. The biological behavior followed a very aggressive course. Four of the six patients developed pulmonary metastases 6 to 12 months after initial surgery; one patient presented initially with pulmonary metastases. Adequate tumor sampling as well as optimal correlation with clinical and radiographic information are required to distinguish the MFH subtype of osteogenic sarcoma from MFH of bone, both being high-grade neoplasms, however.\r"

  ".W": "Renotropic activity was previously demonstrated in an ovine LH preparation. This preparation was further purified with a series of chromatographic steps, and the fractions were assayed for renotropic activity in vivo by their ability to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation into renal DNA of castrated hypophysectomized male rats. A purified preparation could be dissociated by acid treatment into two major constituent subunits, designated alpha and beta, each of which was composed of three microheterogeneous components (subunits alpha 1-3 and beta 1-3) by reverse phase HPLC. Peptide mapping, including amino acid analyses and partial sequencing of the purified peptides, showed that 1) subunits alpha 3 and beta 3 possess the full length of the polypeptide chains, with the same amino acid sequences as those of the corresponding LH subunits alpha and beta, respectively; and 2) subunits alpha 1 and alpha 2 are complexes of three polypeptides which are missing several N-terminal residues from subunit alpha 3. Conversely, subunits beta 1 and beta 2 lack the C-terminal two residues and one residue, respectively, of subunit beta 3. Renotropic activity was not detected in any of the dissociated subunits alone, but association of alpha 1-3 with beta 1-3 reconstituted the hormonal activity with different potencies. In particular, combination of subunits alpha 3 and beta 3 (alpha 3.beta 3) yielded a potent renotropic activity with weak gonadotropic activity. The carbohydrate composition of the purified preparation exhibiting renotropic activity differed from that of a reference oLH preparation, which possessed greater gonadotropic activity but was devoid of renotropic activity. Furthermore, renotropic activity was decreased after removal of sialic acid by treatment with neuraminidase. Thus, the oligosaccharide moieties as well as the amino acid sequences of the subunits may play an important role in the expression of renotropic activity in vivo, these effects over and above those arising from differential metabolic clearance. We conclude that pituitary renotropin represents a novel activity of a LH- isoform(s) and that the posttranslational (or the artificial, i.e. during preparation) modification of the constituent LH subunits may be responsible for modulation of renotropic activity as well as the intrinsic gonadotropic activity.\r"

The estimated mol wt (Mr) of the small hCG by gel filtration is 43K compared to 58K for authentic hCG. The pI of SP-hCG is 10.0, suggesting deficiency of sialic acids. SP-hCG dissociates into subunits when treated with 6 M guanidine-HCl or analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two beta-subunits of SP-hCG were found with estimated Mr of 23K and 20K. Both are distinctly smaller than authentic hCG beta. A single alpha-subunit was found, with an estimated Mr of 21 K. The immunoactivity (8,900-10,000 IU/mg) of highly purified SP-hCG was comparable to that of reference hCG (CR119) determined by a RIA method using anti-hCG antibodies. The hCG/LH receptor-binding activity of SP-hCG is equivalent to that of reference hCG (CR119). Its biological activity is lower than that of reference hCG (approximately 30% or more) assayed by the in vitro stimulation of rat Leydig cells to produce testosterone and cAMP. A high dose is required to attain the same level of stimulation as reference hCG. The amino acid composition of SP-hCG is similar to that of reference hCG, whereas its hexsamine content is significantly lower. Its glucosamine content is about half that in reference hCG, while it completely lacks galactosamine. These findings suggest that SP-hCG is deficient in O-linked oligosaccharide chain in the beta-subunit, and that the N-linked oligosaccharide chains of both subunits are shortened. SP-hCG is one of the principal forms of the hormone present in first trimester placenta and may be a key intermediate in the posttranslational biosynthesis of hCG. Although it lacks O-linked sugar chains and shortened N-linked sugar chains, it possesses substantial biological activity. To have full biological activity, the hCG molecule must contain the complete complement of sugar chains.\r"

It has also been detected, however, in serum of healthy women and in patients with benign gynecologic diseases. Previous studies in patients with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome suggested that the production of CA-125 is correlated with proliferative ovarian activity. In this study, we describe the pattern of CA-125 secretion in 13 healthy women during menstrual cycle and during hormonal contraceptive treatment. That pattern is characterized by an increase of CA-125 serum concentrations parallel to the growth of the dominant follicle. It was not observed during hormonal contraceptive treatment. We conclude that CA-125 serum levels during menstrual cycle seem to be dependent upon the cyclic changes in the female genital tract.\r"

  ".W": "We measured gastric mucus pH in vivo in a canine chambered stomach preparation using glass pH microelectrodes. The average maximum mucus pH was 6.52 at a luminal pH of 3.0, declining gradually as luminal pH was lowered; the mucus pH gradient was obliterated completely when luminal pH reached 1.1. At a luminal pH of 1.0, the average maximum mucus pH increased to 6.03, whereas transmural potential dropped from -50.3 to -31.8 mV. Prostaglandin E2 pretreatment (10 micrograms/ml) prevented epithelial injury during exposure to 100 mM HCl, but mucus pH was unchanged as compared with the acid-only group (4.77 vs. 4.72, p = 0.92). Histology on stomachs exposed to a luminal pH of 1.0 revealed characteristic changes of superficial epithelial injury without affecting the deeper gastric glands or disrupting the basal lamina. Prostaglandin E2 pretreatment prevented these histologic changes. These results indicate that although the mucus pH gradient can be overwhelmed by high luminal acidity, a newly formed mucus pH gradient may develop after disruption of epithelial integrity, possibly providing protection for the mucosa during the period of epithelial repair. The high mucus pH (4.77) accompanying normal histology and unchanged potential suggests that prostaglandin E2 may protect the surface epithelium by the stimulation of bicarbonate secretion.\r"

Monoclonal antibody 19-9 detects the gastrointestinal cancer-associated antigen (sialylated Lewis A). Monoclonal antibody 55-2 detects the Lewis Y antigen and reacts with deep crypt cells in the normal colon. In the normal colon MAb 73-3 reacts with mature superficial columnar cells detecting the protein moiety of a 35,000-dalton glycoprotein. In cases of inactive or mildly active disease, MAbs 19-9, 55-2, and 73-3 had staining patterns similar to normal colon. In 72% and 44% of cases of severely active disease, MAb 19-9 and MAb 73-3, respectively, reacted with epithelial cells at all levels of the crypt, whereas MAb 55-2 reacted only with deep crypt cells. Monoclonal antibodies 19-9, 55-2, and 73-3 reacted with dysplastic epithelium in 70%, 10%, and 60% of cases, respectively. In severely active disease, proliferating epithelial cells \"paradoxically\" express markers of differentiated epithelium throughout the entire crypt. Similarly, colonic epithelial cells may have the ability to reversibly express tumor-associated antigens. Unfortunately, the MAbs used in this study cannot differentiate dysplasia from reactive epithelium.\r"

Chronic portal hypertension was induced by a two-stage complete portal vein occlusion procedure. Basal gastric mucosal blood flow was significantly higher in portal hypertensive rats than in sham-operated rats, but there was no difference in basal acid output. In response to administration of pentagastrin, there was the expected rise in both acid secretion and blood flow in sham-operated rats, but in portal hypertensive rats there was a significantly lower increase in acid output and no change in blood flow. In portal hypertensive rats pretreated with indomethacin to inhibit endogenous prostaglandin generation, both basal blood flow and acid secretion--and their response to pentagastrin administration--were the same as in non-indomethacin-treated sham-operated rats. We conclude that in portal hypertensive rats there is an increased gastric mucosal blood flow and an impaired acid output response to pentagastrin stimulation, and these changes appear to be mediated by an increase in endogenous prostaglandin.\r"

Colonic drug metabolism was studied by equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces. Complete azoreduction occurred in most cases. Concentrations of 5-aminosalicylic acid, but not N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, in faecal dialysates increased dose dependently. Serum concentrations disclosed no cumulation in the long term and olsalazine was well tolerated, although loose stools occurred transiently in some patients with extensive disease: this was associated with a larger proportion of unsplit olsalazine in the faecal dialysates. Patients with ulcerative colitis having a high prostaglandin E2 concentration (greater than ng/ml) determined by equilibrium dialysis of rectum, were less likely to benefit from treatment. Olsalazine is a very effective means of delivery of 5-aminosalicylic acid to the colonic mucosa in active disease. Use of the drug in controlled trials may be considered safe even in prolonged high dosage.\r"

We show that the stilbene disulfonate (4,4-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS) inhibits lysis of YAC-1 targets by the cloned cell line NKB61A2. Inhibition of lysis occurs on the level of the effector cell inasmuch as preincubation of effectors but not of targets interferes with subsequent lysis. Moreover, inhibition of chloride flux in the target does not interfere with target cell lysis by cytotoxic granules isolated from killer cells. Target cell binding takes place in the presence of DIDS or absence of external chloride, suggesting that events that follow target cell binding require chloride flux. We show that reorientation of the Golgi apparatus, which occurs subsequent to target cell binding in the effector cell, occurs under conditions that interfere with chloride flux. It is therefore suggested that events in the effector cell taking place subsequent to the Golgi apparatus reorientation reaction are inhibited and that delivery of the lethal hit is a stimulus-induced secretory event that requires transmembrane chloride flux. Delivery of the lethal hit is shown to be independent of the release of N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT) serine esterase, suggesting that cytolytic components and BLT serine esterase are likely packaged in different vesicles.\r"

Homogenates of the isolated glands exhibited activities of delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta HSD), 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and testosterone 5 alpha-reductase by the conversion of [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) to 3H-delta 4-androstenedione (AD), [3H]testosterone, and [3H]dihydrotestosterone. Homogenates of glands from bald (B) scalp had greater 3 beta HSD activity than homogenates of glands from hairy (H) scalp. After differential centrifugation, 3 beta HSD activity was found mainly in the microsomal and 105,000 X g supernatant fractions. Specific activity of the enzyme based on protein mass was highest in the microsomal fraction; however, the total 3 beta HSD activity in the 105,000 X g supernatent of B glands was significantly (p less than .01) greater than that of H glands. 3 beta HSD activity in sebaceous glands isolated from autopsy specimens did not differ from that of glands isolated from surgical specimens in apparent Km (0.13-0.14 microM), pH optima (8.0), or coenzyme requirement for NAD. Since substantial 3 beta HSD activity was present in the cytosol, and cytosol of B glands showed increased 3 beta HSD activity, the increased conversion of DHA to AD may be a critical step for androgenic action and may be responsible for excessive androgenicity in male-pattern baldness.\r"

An increase in the number of ATPase+ and Ia+ dendritic cells was observed in skin over all three tumor types. Morphologic alterations in the cells were also noted, including a decrease in dendricity. These changes were apparent only in skin directly over growing tumor masses; contralateral and perilesional skin was unaffected. Injection of nontumorigenic cells and implantation of silicon did not induce changes in Langerhans cells. Regression of highly antigenic tumor cells and tumor regression in immunized mice were not accompanied by detectable alterations in Langerhans cells, whereas changes in Langerhans cells were apparent during tumor growth in nude mice. These results demonstrate that changes in the number and morphology of Langerhans cells occur in response to tumor growth but that the changes are not dependent on immunologic or inflammatory responses.\r"

  ".W": "Primary murine keratinocytes can be maintained in culture for extended periods in a proliferative, basal cell state under conditions of reduced extracellular Ca2+. In response to increased Ca2+ concentrations, the cells undergo a well-defined program of terminal differentiation, thus serving as a convenient model in which to study the genes involved in regulating this and possibly other differentiation cascades by DNA-mediated gene transfer. However, because of their sensitivity to increased Ca2+ concentrations, the introduction of exogenous genomic DNA into primary keratinocytes by conventional methods is problematic. We have optimized the calcium phosphate DNA transfection procedure by introducing conditions that reduce the potency of Ca2+ as a differentiation signal. Primary epidermal cells were transfected with pSV2CAT, a plasmid that codes for the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT. Enzyme activity was measured in cell extracts under varying transfection conditions. When the K+ concentration of the medium used for transfection by calcium phosphate precipitation is reduced from 6.5 to 0.01 mM, CAT activity following transfection increases 2-3 times. Exposure to the DNA precipitate for 2-4 h is optimal. By the use of fibroblast conditioned medium following transfection, enzyme activity can be detected in cell extracts for at least 21 d, suggesting that the exogenous gene is integrated. The low K+/Ca2+ transfection method is more effective than SrCl2 used as an alternative for CaCl2 in Ca2+ sensitive cells. Low K+ medium enhances cell survival for Ca2+ mediated transfection but also appears to have a beneficial effect on DNA uptake or expression.\r"

The surgical procedures included maxillary downgrafting, advancement, setback, superior repositioning with expansion, and mandibular advancement and chin augmentation. Seventeen biopsies were obtained from nine patients after successful healing from 4.7 to 16.4 months postoperatively. Anatomic sites of the biopsies included maxillary wall, interdental region, palatal midline, chin, and mandible. In addition, nine implants representing six planned and three unplanned exposures were retrieved from nine patients. One biopsy from a successful implant was decalcified and thin-sectioned to provide better cell detail of the antral lining of the implant. The remaining biopsies were sectioned undecalcified to permit backscattered electron imaging with a scanning electron microscope. Each of the 17 biopsy specimens contained bone ingrowth. The decalcified specimen showed an intact submucosa with loss of the mucosal epithelium due to prolonged acid exposure. The biopsies were composed of 48.5% HA matrix, 18.0% bone ingrowth, and 33.5% soft tissue or vascular space. The HA matrix surface area averaged 9.4 mm2/mm3 with 62.1% of the surface covered by appositional bone ingrowth. The nine exposed implants contained connective tissue ingrowth only at their margins, with little or no bone being present. This graft-like biologic response to a porous HA matrix confirmed its ability to serve as a bone graft substitute in clinical applications. The absence of any decrease over time confirmed the relative permanence of the HA matrix. The lack of inflammatory cells in the biopsies, along with the formation of a connective tissue protective barrier in the exposed specimens, suggests that host responses to contamination were not impaired by the porous HA matrix.\r"

The material comprised 40 mature maxillary central incisors in 20 green Vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops). Teeth were either allotransplanted or autotransplanted in pairs of monkeys matched only for the size of the root. Endodontic treatment was performed at random peroperatively with gutta percha and Kerr sealer in 10 of each of the 20 autografts and 20 allografts. The extra-alveolar period was 18 minutes in all groups. Histometric analysis, which included registration of surface and inflammatory and replacement resorption (ankylosis), was done on serial sections of the grafts 8 weeks after transplantation. Endodontic treatment almost completely reduced inflammatory resorption in both allotransplanted and autotransplanted mature teeth (p less than 0.01). Peroperative endodontics elicited a small increase in ankylosis in autografts. In allografts, it unmasked a high amount of ankylosis, presumably primarily due to alloimmune reactions against the donor periodontal ligament, leaving only a small portion of normal ligament almost exclusively located along the cervical region of the root surface. Downgrowth of periodontal pocket epithelium was limited in all groups.\r"

The most likely explanation for the complication is a transmittal of force from the osteotome used to fracture through the pterygoid plates extending superiorly through the medial surface of the cavernous sinus. This case clearly demonstrates the importance of care in positioning of the pterygomaxillary osteotome.\r"

We have developed a microtiter assay that assesses differentiation of HL-60 cells on the basis of cytochrome c reduction. HL-60 cells were incubated with known standards or unknown samples, including crude fermentation broths, for 6 days; then cytochrome c reduction was quantified as a function of increasing absorbance at 550 nm on a microtiter plate reader. HL-60 cells induced to differentiate showed up to a 10-fold increase in absorbance over that of control cells. Differentiation was confirmed by morphological assessment and by flow cytometric analysis of the DNA cell-cycle distribution and the cell-surface transferrin receptor. Analysis of 198 crude fermentation broth samples confirmed the feasibility of using this assay for large-scale drug screening.\r"

The genotype frequencies were investigated in three non-insulin-dependent diabetic populations. The frequencies (%) of X1.X1, X1.X2, and X2.X2 were 13, 51, and 36 among 89 North European diabetic subjects, and 8, 38, 54 among their 104 controls (chi 2 test p less than 0.02; G-test p less than 0.02). For 53 South European diabetic patients the frequencies were 19, 50, 31, and for their 41 controls they were 2, 58, 40 (chi 2 test p less than 0.02; G-test p less than 0.01). The corresponding figures were 6, 55, 39 for 45 Japanese patients and 0, 28, 72 for a further 49 controls (chi 2 test p less than 0.01; G-test p less than 0.001).

  ".U": "88288404\r", 
  ".W": "Genetic engineering is a powerful tool for exploring correlations between structure and function in proteins, but as yet we are unable to use it for effective protein design. One of the most interesting examples, which would seem to be obvious, is reversing the polarity of an ion pair. Changing a positively charged protein group, that provides a strong binding for negative substrates, to a negative group is expected to provide an effective binding site for a positively charged substrate. But several recent experiments on aspartate aminotransferase, trypsin and aspartate transcarbamoylase (Schachman, H. K. personal communication) have indicated that polarity reversal is not so successful. Here we argue that the same factors that make the enzyme an effective system for the (-+) pair will make it a much less effective system for the (+-) pair. We also point out that the unusually low effective dielectric constant (epsilon approximately equal to 13) for the (-+) interaction is due to its microenvironment and this will destabilize a (+-) arrangement having an entirely different dielectric constant (epsilon approximately equal to 80). The calculations presented here evaluate the energetics of ion pairs in protein active sites on a semiquantitative level. This is particularly important when dealing with strong, functionally important interactions that are difficult to evaluate with macroscopic models.\r"

On an average, recapturing of the disk and cementation of the onlays lowered the mandible by 2.5 mm and protruded it by 0.5 mm. During the observation period of 7 months the mandible had a tendency to resume its original position. The relapse was 80% in the sagittal plane, 70% in the transverse plane, and 12% in the vertical plane.

We present a retrospective clinicopathologic analysis of 23 previously unreported cases of oral KS in male homosexual and bisexual patients from the New York metropolitan area. Our data reveal that 21 of the patients had KS confined to the oral cavity and that, in 16 cases, the oral KS was the first presenting sign of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Sixteen of the 23 patients had solitary oral lesions. Nineteen of the tumors showed prominent endothelium-lined capillaries resembling lymphatics, 16 exhibited a prominent spindle cell component, and 17 demonstrated areas of fibrosis. Of the 13 patients for whom there was adequate follow-up information, five were dead within 6 to 15 months. All five deaths were due to Pneumocystis pneumonia.\r"

The presence of bacteria in 15 single-rooted teeth with periapical lesions was studied throughout a whole period of treatment. Patients were randomly divided into three groups. In group 1, a control group, the intracanal medication was omitted. The teeth were enlarged under aseptic conditions in combination with the use of 3% H2O2 and 5.25% NaOCl as irrigants. In group 2, after chemomechanical preparation, the root canals were dressed with 2 microliter of 40% CMCP. The medicament was replaced on days 3 and 7. In group 3, root canals were treated in a manner similar to those in group 2, except that the medicament was renewed on days 1 and 7. The loss of CMCP was determined in groups 2 and 3. The results showed that chemomechanical preparation could reduce bacteria in root canals to an uncultivable number. Approximately 62.5% of the original concentration of CMCP was lost after placement in root canals for 1 day. Intracanal dressing with CMCP between appointments induced a rapid decrease in number of bacteria in root canals within the first 1 to 3 days. However, compared to chemomechanical preparation, the antimicrobial effect of CMCP was not clinically impressive because negative cultures also could be observed despite the absence of intracanal medications.\r"

The properties of the chloroplast enzyme are clearly distinct from cytosolic gluconeogenic Fru-P2-ases. Light-dependent activation by way of a ferredoxin/thioredoxin system and insensitivity to AMP inhibition are distinctive characteristics of the chloroplast enzyme. However, the chloroplast enzyme shows a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity to gluconeogenic Fru-P2-ases. Sequence data reported for a total of 285 residues (approximately 75% of the structure) of the spinach chloroplast enzyme reveals a 46% amino acid sequence identity with pig kidney Fru-P2-ase. We now report the amino acid sequence of a region consisting of 46 additional residues. This region is located near the middle of the primary structure of the enzyme and it includes a 16-residue insert not present in other Fru-P2-ases. This sequence insert has two cysteines separated by only 4 amino acid residues (Cys-Val-Val-Asn-Val-Cys), a characteristic feature of at least three other enzymes containing redox-active cysteines. It appears likely that this region of chloroplast Fru-P2-ase is involved in light-dependent activation.\r"

The primary in vitro proliferation was blocked with monoclonal antibodies to Ia molecules, to lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), and to L3T4. T helper cell populations sensitized in vitro to haptens and protein antigens showed hapten- and antigen-specific proliferation when restimulated in vitro with spleen cells.

  ".U": "88289781\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), a polypeptide present in abundant amounts in bone matrix, was examined for its effects on osteoclast formation by using a human bone marrow culture system in which multinucleated cells (MNCs) with osteoclast characteristics form. TGF-beta strongly inhibited MNC formation at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml. TGF-beta also completely suppressed the effects of osteotropic factors known to stimulate MNC formation. The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta on osteoclast-like cell formation was more pronounced during the first week of culture, which corresponds to the period of proliferation of mononuclear osteoclast precursors. To examine whether the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta on MNC formation could be due to inhibition of the granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cell [colony-forming unit granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM)], the probable precursor for MNC, we tested the effects of TGF-beta on CFU-GM formation in presence of a source of colony-stimulating factor. Unexpectedly, TGF-beta at concentrations (0.1-1 ng/ml) that were inhibitory for MNC formation enhanced day 7 CFU-GM colony formation. This increase in CFU-GM colony formation seen in cultures containing TGF-beta resulted from significantly more granulocytic colonies being formed in the cultures, suggesting that TGF-beta may induce CFU-GM to differentiate preferentially to cells of the granulocytic lineage. Differentiation of CFU-GM to granulocytes rather than osteoclast precursors in response to TGF-beta would result in inhibition of MNC formation by depleting the precursor pool for MNC. These data suggest that inhibition of osteoclast-like cell formation by TGF-beta may be an important mechanism of control of local bone resorption.\r"

Methylation of cytosine in DNA could potentially participate in such alterations of gene expression. Abnormalities in DNA methylation are a consistent feature of human neoplasms, and we now show that these include not only previously recognized widespread genomic hypomethylation, but also regional increases in gene methylation. A hot spot for abnormal methylation of C + G-rich areas has been detected on the short arm of chromosome 11 in an area known to harbor tumor suppressor genes. This change occurs consistently in common forms of human cancer and appears early during the transformation of cells with viruses including members of the human T-cell leukemia (HTLV) family. Furthermore, in one chromosome 11 gene examined, calcitonin, the increased methylation in somatic tumor cells coincides with the presence of an \"inactive\" chromatin pattern in the transcriptional regulatory area. The increased regional DNA methylation demonstrated may then participate in or mark chromosomal changes associated with gene inactivation events that are central to the genesis and/or progression of human cancers.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: In an attempt to decrease the risk for reactivation of life-threatening invasive aspergillosis (IA) during subsequent myelosuppression in patients with previously diagnosed IA who were receiving antileukemic treatment, we evaluated the role of intensive antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine administered prophylactically throughout the antileukemic regimen and induced granulocytopenia to prevent IA reactivation without compromising the intensive chemotherapy. PATIENTS and METHODS: During a 30-month period, 10 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and primary IA developing during initial antileukemia induction therapy and severe granulocytopenia (less than 100/mm3) underwent 14 subsequent courses of intensive marrow aplasia-producing chemotherapy during early complete remission or at leukemia relapse. All patients had evidence of ongoing IA healing by lung computerized tomography (CT) prior to reinstitution of intensive chemotherapy. Nine patients receiving 13 chemotherapy courses also received aggressive prophylactic anti-IA therapy with amphotericin B (1.0 mg/kg/day) and 5-fluorocytosine beginning at least 48 hours prior to antileukemia therapy institution and continued until the time of granulocyte recovery. RESULTS: All nine patients receiving aggressive antifungal therapy survived without clinical evidence of IA reactivation. Transient radiographic evidence of IA reactivation during granulocytopenia was detected by lung CT during two of the 13 chemotherapy courses. In contrast, the patient who did not receive anti-IA prophylaxis had both clinical and radiographic evidence of IA reactivation during severe granulocytopenia and died. Anti-IA prophylaxis was achieved without irreversible nephrotoxicity, prolonged marrow suppression, alteration of antileukemia treatment, or negative impact on clinical outcome relative to acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: This approach of antifungal prophylaxis in adults with acute leukemia and documented primary IA occurring during initial induction chemotherapy has been successful in preventing clinically significant IA reactivation during subsequent granulocytopenic courses, and allows for administration of additional intensive antileukemia therapy.\r"

Because the production of osteonectin depends on the osteoblastlike function of the individual tumor cell, a homogeneous immunocytochemical staining of all tumor cells cannot be expected. Nevertheless, the immunocytochemical demonstration of osteonectin in osteolytic tumors that produce no or scarcely any matrix seems to be a valuable tool for establishment of their osteogenic origin.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, hematologic, and phenotypic features of 28 patients with acute leukemia with megakaryocytic involvement (AMKL) were analyzed. The prevalence of this type of leukemia in the entire series was 11.6%, with a higher incidence among patients with acute transformation of a previous myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) (24%) than among the transformed myelodysplastic syndrome (13%) patients. The incidence in the \"de novo\" ANLL was 8% and 16% among secondary leukemias. The presence of bone marrow fibrosis together with low WBC and normal or increased platelet counts despite a severe anemia are the most relevant features in these patients who otherwise displayed an apparently poor prognosis. Megakaryoblasts were morphologically recognized more frequently in the acute transformations of MPD than in de novo ANLL. Only two cases were considered pure AMKL, and in the remaining 26 patients, megakaryoblasts coexisted with other granulomonocytic and/or erythroid populations. Antiglycoprotein IIIa (anti-GPIIIa) (C17) and anti-GPIIb/IIIa (CDw41-, J15-) antibodies are probably the best markers for AMKL, although the monoclonal antibody against GPIX (FMC25) was also positive in a majority of cases but in a lower percentage of cells. On the other hand, megakaryoblasts were generally negative for granulocytic or monocytic markers (CD13, CD14, CD15); the expression of HLA-DR antigens in these cells was variable. Our present results indicate that megakaryoblastic involvement is more common than previously recognized. This is true not only in acute transformed leukemias but also in de novo ANLL. Although the diagnosis of these cases should be based on megakaryocytic markers, it is often possible to suspect a diagnosis according to certain clinical and hematologic features.\r"

There were 27 remissions in the 36 relapsed patients and two in the four patients with primary refractory disease. Seventeen of the 23 patients with common ALL, four of the six with T-cell ALL, one of the three with B-cell ALL, and seven of eight whose cells were not characterized responded. Toxicity of this regimen was comparable to other reinduction regimens for ALL, but the side effects characteristic of high-dose cytarabine therapy were absent. Since these results compare favorably with conventional induction regimens, its use in the primary treatment of adults and children with high-risk ALL is proposed.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The breakpoints on chromosome 22 are clustered within a 5.8-kilobase (kb) DNA fragment known as the breakpoint cluster region (bcr), which encodes part of a functionally active gene. We analyzed the bcr in DNAs from 108 consecutive, unselected Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML patients by Southern blot and determined five restriction enzyme fragments within which breaks occur on chromosome 22. The exact sublocalization was determined in the DNA of 100 patients. It was found to be within the 5.8-kb in 99 patients and outside the bcr in only one. Within the bcr, most of the breakpoints occurred in fragments 1, 2, and 3. Overall, laboratory and clinical features of CML did not correlate with specific breakpoint fragments, but chronic-phase duration was longer in patients with a breakpoint in fragment 2 of the bcr. Large 3' bcr deletions were found in nine patients but did not influence clinical outcome. DNA from one of six patients analyzed both during chronic phase and blastic crisis showed an additional aberrant fragment, which suggested that a second abnormal clone developed in blastic crisis.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (45 to 100 mg/m2/day). Of these, eight cases had been either nonresponsive or resistant to previous chemotherapy; the other 16 cases were previously untreated. All patients attained complete remission without developing bone marrow hypoplasia. Bone marrow suspension cultures were studied in 15 of the 24 patients. Fourteen of these patients had morphological maturation in response to the retinoic acid (1 mumol/L). Chloroacetate esterase and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase staining as well as electronmicroscopic examination confirmed that retinoic acid-induced cells differentiated to granulocytes with increased functional maturation (as measured by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, NBT). The single nonresponder to retinoic acid in vitro was resistant to treatment with retinoic acid but attained complete remission after addition of low-dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). During the course of therapy, none of the patients showed any abnormalities in the coagulation parameters we measured, suggesting an absence of any subclinical disseminated intravascular coagulation. The only side effects consisted of mild dryness of the lips and skin, with occasional headaches and digestive symptoms. Eight patients have relapsed after 2 to 5 months of complete remission. The others remain in complete remission at 1+ to 11+ months and are still being followed up. We conclude that all-trans retinoic acid is an effective inducer for attaining complete remission in APL.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet aggregation requires the binding of adhesive proteins such as fibrinogen to the heterodimer of membrane glycoproteins IIb (GPIIb) and IIIa (GPIIIa). Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells synthesize both GPIIb and GPIIIa. Using poly(A+) RNA purified from HEL cells, we constructed a cDNA library in the lambda gt10 phage vector. This library was screened with a 38mer oligonucleotide derived from a platelet GPIIIa peptide, and three overlapping cDNAs were isolated. The three inserts encompassed 3.5 kilobases (kb), including the entire coding region of mature GPIIIa (2,286 basepairs, bp) and 1.3 kb of 3' untranslated sequence. All 222 residues determined directly from platelet GPIIIa tryptic peptides exactly matched the HEL cell-deduced amino acid sequence. The HEL cell sequence matched a previously reported endothelial cell cDNA sequence except for eight nucleotides. Five of these nucleotide differences were silent changes consistent with genetic polymorphisms. The other three differences resulted in changes in the deduced amino acid sequence of GPIIIa; reexamination of the endothelial cell cDNA sequence in these three areas revealed that it is actually identical to the HEL cell sequence. The virtual identity of the endothelial and HEL cell cDNA sequences provides direct evidence that GPIIIa is a subunit common to cell-adhesion receptors present in more than one cell type. We localized the gene for GPIIIa to chromosome 17, the same chromosome to which we had previously mapped the gene for GPIIb.\r"

This analysis revealed that the hypersensitive site extends from approximately -210 +/- 5 to -25 +/- 5 base pairs (bp) upstream from the transcription initiation site. Within this region, a GC-rich region located between the proximal CCAAT box and the TATA box is particularly accessible to nuclease digestion; however, the 5' end of the hypersensitive site is less accessible to nucleases. The pattern of DNAse I cleavage does not change on either strand with hemin induction of K562 cells, which increases the rate of gamma-globin gene transcription about threefold. The region within the hypersensitive site includes all the consensus promoter elements of the gamma-globin genes as well as an octamer sequence located between -182 and -175, and a region associated with a variety of mutations that may cause hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH).\r"

  ".W": "The authors treated a total of 82 patients with Ph'-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with recombinant interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b). Sixty-five patients in chronic phase (CP), 28 of whom were untreated and 37 pretreated, and nine patients in accelerated phase (AP), were started on IFN three times a week. Patients in CP were randomized to receive 2 or 5 X 10(6) IU/m2, while patients in AP were all given the dose of 5 X 10(6) IU/m2, in addition to concomitant chemotherapy. Patients in CP who were unresponsive to the lower dose were crossed to the higher dose. Of 63 evaluable patients in CP, 43 (68%) responded, 29 (46%) achieved complete hematologic response (CHR), and 14 (22%) achieved partial hematologic response (PHR). The response rate appeared to be significantly influenced by the IFN dose in pretreated patients. Of the nine patients in AP, two attained PHR and one CHR. More recently, eight previously untreated CP cases were submitted to daily IFN administration at doses from 2 to 5 X 10(6) IU/m2. This daily schedule was also applied to patients who had obtained, with the intermittent treatment, a PHR persisting unmodified for six months (nine patients) or an unstable CHR (five patients). Seven of the eight previously untreated patients, and five of the nine PHR patients crossed to daily IFN reached CHR. In the total series of previously untreated patients, the response rate proved to be significantly influenced by the initial risk status. Cytogenetic improvement was seen in 37 of 53 responders (70%) treated for more than 3 months, the median of Ph'-positive cells declining from 100% to 65% (range 0% to 95%). Complete suppression of Ph' chromosome was observed in one case. The cytogenetic response was persistent for over 6 months in 21 patients, but the lowest value of Ph' positivity was usually unstable. At a median follow-up of 56 weeks, 23 of 36 (64%) CHR patients remain in continued disease control with IFN. A blastic transformation (BT) occurred in seven of 21 unresponsive patients and in one of the 36 CHR patients. The authors' data confirm that IFN alpha-2b, especially at daily doses, is effective in inducing clinical and cytogenetic response in a good proportion of patients with CML in the benign phase. Longer follow-ups will define the exact influence of this agent on the natural course of the disease.\r"

These data suggest a frequent role for c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of AIDS-associated NHL, independent of histologic type. Conversely, EBV does not appear to be directly involved in lymphomagenesis in the majority of AIDS-associated NHLs.\r"

Inositol triphosphate increases calcium levels, while diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. The present studies demonstrate that exogenous PLC generates inositol phosphates, releases choline metabolites, and activates protein kinase C in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. PLC also induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells as manifested by adherence, growth inhibition, and appearance of monocytic cell surface antigens. Furthermore, PLC treatment decreased c-myc mRNA levels and induced c-fos, c-fms, and tumor necrosis factor transcripts. The changes in gene expression induced by PLC are similar to those previously shown to be associated with phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Our results thus demonstrate that exogenous PLC activates HL-60 cell protein kinase C and that this effect is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation. PLC may therefore play a role in transducing signals from physiological inducers of monocytic differentiation.\r"

These encode different c-abl messenger RNAs (mRNAs), p210 and p190, respectively. It has been suggested that one class of Ph+ ALL (bcr+) may be a variant of CML arising in a multipotent stem cell, the other (bcr-) de novo ALL initiated in a lymphoid-committed progenitor. Thirty-two cases of ALL (12 Ph1+, ten chromosomally normal, and ten non-mitotic cases) were investigated for bcr involvement. Breakpoints were found within five Ph1+ and in one normal case. There was no difference in clinical features, common ALL antigen (CALLA) positivity, cytogenetics, or response to treatment between the 6 bcr+ and 7 Ph1+ bcr- patients. Myeloid antigen expression was found in 2 bcr+ cases. Bcr rearrangement appeared to be restricted to the lymphoblastic component of marrow or blood in at least four bcr+ cases. In one case, separated myeloid and lymphoid cell fractions were both bcr+. Potential heterogeneity of the Ph1+ target cell, as seen in this study, may be more important in determining disease outcome than the precise location of the Ph breakpoint.\r"

  ".W": "Reports of estrone (E1) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfatase (sulfohydrolase) activities within many human breast cancers have prompted us to undertake the identification and partial characterization of these enzyme activities within MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Enzyme assays were performed within subcellular preparations and intact cultures by quantifying the total nonpolar 3H-labeled metabolites formed from [3H]E1 sulfate (E1S) and [3H]DHEA sulfate (DHEAS). The results have shown that the hydrolysis of each steroid sulfate is mediated by different particulate enzymes, which demonstrate optimal activity between pH 6.0-7.0. The analysis of enzyme kinetic data showed the Km values of E1S and DHEAS for their enzymes to be approximately 6.3 and 3.6 microM/L, respectively. Neither enzyme was subject to product inhibition. Androsterone sulfate and pregnenolone sulfate produced significant inhibition of E1, but not DHEA, sulfatase activity. E1S inhibited DHEA sulfatase competitively, with an approximate Ki of 11 microM, whereas DHEAS inhibited E2 sulfatase in a noncompetitive fashion, demonstrating an approximate Ki of 0.6 microM. Studies carried out with intact MCF-7 cultures using physiological concentrations of 3H-labeled E1S (2 nM) or DHEAS (1 microM) showed the accumulation of nonpolar metabolites during a 20-h incubation period. When cultures were incubated with similar concentrations of both steroid sulfates the apparent intracellular activity of E1 sulfatase was reduced by approximately 70%, whereas DHEA sulfatase activity remained unchanged. The results of these studies confirm the ability of MCF-7 cells to hydrolyze extracellular E1S and DHEAS, indicate that these reactions are mediated by different enzymes, and demonstrate that DHEAS is a potent inhibitor of MCF-7 E1 sulfatase. Circulating DHEAS, therefore, may substantially limit the ability of most postmenopausal breast cancers to use E1S as a substrate for intracellular estrogen biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "We have determined the structures of high mannose (Man) oligosaccharide units at individual glycosylation sites of mouse TSH. Mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue was incubated with D-[2-3H]Man with or without [14C]tyrosine ([14C] Tyr) for 2, 3, or 6 h, and for a 3-h pulse followed by a 2-h chase. TSH heterodimers or free alpha-subunits were obtained from homogenates using specific antisera. After reduction and alkylation, subunits were treated with trypsin. The tryptic fragments were then loaded on a reverse phase HPLC column to separate tryptic fragments bearing labeled oligosaccharides. The N-linked oligosaccharides were released with endoglycosidase-H and analyzed by paper chromatography. Man9GlcNac2 and Man8GlcNac2 units predominated at each time point and at each specific glycosylation site, but the processing of high Man oligosaccharides differed at each glycosylation site. The processing at Asn23 of TSH beta-subunits was slower than that at Asn56 or Asn82 of alpha-subunits. The processing at Asn82 was slightly faster than that at Asn56 for both alpha-subunits of TSH heterodimers and free alpha-subunits. The present study demonstrates that the early processing of oligosaccharides differs at the individual glycosylation sites of TSH and free alpha-subunits, perhaps because of local conformational differences.\r"

  ".U": "88296320\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) has been shown to influence the growth and differentiation of many widely varied cell types in vitro, including some that are endocrinologically active. We have investigated the previously unknown effects of this unique growth factor in the differentiated rat thyroid follicular cell line FRTL-5. The cells demonstrated specific, high affinity binding of TGF beta, and as with other epithelial cells, the growth of these thyroid follicular cells was potently inhibited by addition of TGF beta to the culture medium. TGF beta caused a significant reduction in TSH-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in the cells. The addition of (Bu)2cAMP along with the growth factor to cultures partially reversed the characteristic morphological changes seen with TGF beta, but did not reverse the growth inhibition. To further investigate the possible mechanisms of the effects of TGF beta on the cells, we measured the influence of the growth factor on [125I]TSH binding. TGF beta did not compete for specific TSH-binding sites; however, exposure of the cells to TGF beta for 12 or more h resulted in a dose-dependent down-regulation of TSH receptors that was fully reversible. While cellular proliferation was potently inhibited by TGF beta, differentiated function, as manifest by iodine-trapping ability, was stimulated by the growth factor. This stimulation of iodine uptake was independent of, and additive to, the stimulatory effects of TSH. Finally, FRTL-5 cells in serum-free medium and in response to TSH were shown to secrete TGF beta-like activity that competed for [125I]TGF beta in a RRA. These studies suggest that TGF beta may represent an autocrine mechanism of controlling the growth response to TSH in thyroid follicular cells, while allowing the continuance of differentiated function.\r"

  ".U": "88296339\r", 
  ".W": "Glucocorticoids increase and 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] decreases the activity of PTH-responsive adenylate cyclase, altering intracellular cAMP in a rat osteoblast-like cell line (ROS 17/2.8). This study was undertaken to measure the subsequent activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Pretreatment of ROS cells for 2 days with the glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide (TRM), shifted the dose-response curve for PKA activation by PTH upward compared to the control value. Basal PKA activity was enhanced 50% by TRM, and the PTH concentration required for maximal activation of PKA decreased from 1.0 to 0.05 ng/ml. At the lowest effective PTH concentration (0.05 ng/ml) the mean PKA activity ratio increased to 0.73 in TRM-treated cells compared with 0.45 in untreated cells. Pretreatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 had opposite effects, shifting the dose-response curve for PKA activation by PTH downward and to the right, decreasing the basal activity ratio from 0.26 to 0.16, and increasing the PTH concentration required for maximal activation to 10 ng/ml. 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells stimulated with 0.5-1 ng/ml PTH consistently had lower PKA activity ratios than untreated cells. Simultaneous treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 reversed the effect of TRM. There were no differences in total PKA activity (2.57 +/- 0.09 pmol 32P/min.micrograms protein) between treatment groups, suggesting that TRM and 1,25-(OH)2D3 do not alter the cellular PKA concentration. In control experiments exogenous PKA was added to sonication buffer of PTH-stimulated cells to verify that the TRM and 1,25-(OH)2D3 shifts in PKA activation at low PTH doses occur before sonication. cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation was also studied by measuring the progressive occupation of regulatory subunit-binding sites by hormonally stimulated endogenous cAMP. [3H] cAMP binding was expressed as the percent change in bound [3H]cAMP per microgram protein compared to that in unstimulated cells not steroid treated. [3H]cAMP binding to all cytosol fractions decreased as PTH increased over the concentration range predicted by our PKA activation experiments. TRM treatment shifted the curve for [3H]cAMP binding to regulatory subunit downward and to the left, and 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment shifted it upward and to the right. In cells treated with both TRM and 1,25-(OH)2D3, the curve was similar to control curve. Sonicating unstimulated cells in buffer containing comparable concentrations of added cAMP did not alter [3H]cAMP binding. These and the previous controls suggest that changes in PKA activation at low doses of PKA reflect cellular events occurring before cell disruption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Diffuse lung injury after endotoxemia in sheep is accompanied by sequestration of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the lungs, and eicosanoids mediate some of the pathophysiology of the response. To determine whether exogenous PGE2 could prevent the endotoxin response, we measured pulmonary hemodynamics, gas exchange, and lung lymph responses to infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin (0.5 micrograms/kg iv over 30 min) in unanesthetized sheep in the presence and absence of PGE2 (0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) infused intravenously for 4 h beginning 0.5 h before endotoxin infusion. We also measured lung lymph concentrations of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and prostacyclin metabolite, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), by radioimmunoassay and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. PGE2 decreased endotoxin-induced pulmonary hypertension and hypoxemia and markedly attenuated the lymph flow and lymph protein clearance responses. PGE2 also attenuated endotoxin-induced increases in lung lymph TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and decreased lymph LTB4 flow after endotoxin without decreasing lymph LTB4 concentrations. We conclude that PGE2 infusion attenuates lung dysfunction caused by endotoxemia, possibly by preventing endogenous release of other eicosanoids.\r"

To determine the effect of silica on the generation of immunoglobulin-secreting cells, mononuclear cells were stimulated with antigens or mitogens and placed into 1) high-density cultures (2.5 X 10(6) cells/ml) that were not exposed to silica, in which pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced generation of immunoglobulin-secreting cells was suppressed by the presence of monocytes; or 2) low-density cultures (0.5 X 10(6) cells/ml) that were not exposed to silica, in which PWM-induced generation of immunoglobulin-secreting cells was not suppressed. Silica added to PWM-stimulated high-density cultures significantly increased the numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells. Silica also significantly increased the numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in high-density cultures stimulated with purified protein derivative and tetanus toxoid and augmented the proliferation of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated mononuclear cells (P less than 0.05). In contrast to high-density cultures, silica added with PWM to low-density cultures reduced the numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells. These studies suggest that silica can have potent regulatory effects on various cellular immune processes that are relevant to the lung.\r"

  ".W": "The basal and stimulated synthesis of immunoassayable 12- and 5-monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE) and leukotrienes (LT) B4 and C4 was studied in glomeruli isolated from rats with nephrotoxic serum glomerulonephritis (NSGN) induced by low (30 micrograms/g body weight) or high (105 micrograms/g) doses of anti-rat glomerular basement membrane (GBM) immunoglobulin (Ig). In the early heterologous phase of the disease, low doses of anti-GBM Ig enhanced the basal synthesis of 12-HETE but not that of 5-HETE or LT. High anti-GBM Ig doses enhanced the basal synthesis of 5-HETE and LTB4 as well. Under stimulated conditions, enhanced glomerular production of 5-HETE and LTB4 occurred at 15 min after infusion of anti-GBM Ig, peaked at 1 h, and returned toward control levels by 24 h. At 48 h, 72 h, and on day 12, the synthesis of these eicosanoids was impaired. Neutrophile depletion only partially reduced glomerular eicosanoid synthesis after induction of NSGN whereas complement depletion significantly reduced 5-HETE, 12-HETE, and LTB4. These observations indicate that in the heterologous phase of NSGN there is enhanced but short-lived glomerular 5-HETE and LTB4 synthesis. This phenomenon is mediated by complement activation and may be an important proinflammatory event leading to capillary wall injury in the early stages of the disease.\r"

While 125I or 59Fe labels were externalized after initial binding and internalization, a large proportion of 3H label was internalized and remained within the cell. When the supernatant of these experiments was studied by isoelectricfocusing and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA120) affinity chromatography, generation of asialotransferrin was noted by both techniques. Incubation of liver endothelium with double-labeled TF (sialic acids with 3H and protein core with 125I or 59Fe) led initially to a concordant uptake of the two labels, which were then dissociated and 3H was retained by the cell. These findings indicate desialation of TF by liver endothelium. The significance of these findings in the pathogenesis of hepatic siderosis is discussed.\r"

TGF-beta 2 is a closely related polypeptide that was originally isolated from bone matrix. TGF-beta 1 has been shown previously to stimulate prostaglandin production in cultures of neonatal mouse calvariae, which causes these bones to resorb. We found similar effects with TGF-beta 2. In comparison, TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 failed to stimulate bone resorption in fetal rat long bone cultures during a 3-d incubation period in concentrations up to 50-100 times greater than those capable of inducing bone resorption in calvariae. Incubation with TGF-beta 1 for a further 3 d decreased bone resorption up to 30%. Moreover, bone resorption induced by the bone-resorbing agents IL 1 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was partially or completely inhibited by TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 during the second half of the 6-d incubation period. Inhibition of DNA synthesis with hydroxyurea inhibited bone resorption in long bones in a similar pattern to that seen with TGF-beta 1. The inhibitory effects of TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 on bone resorption in long bone cultures may therefore be due to inhibition of osteoclast precursor proliferation.\r"

Twenty of these subjects were found to be nonallergic to penicillin on skin testing, and none of these subjects reacted to the imipendem determinants. In contrast, half the 20 subjects who were positive to one or more penicillin determinants also reacted to imipenem reagents. There was a good correlation between the penicillin and imipenem reagents to which the patients reacted. Imipenem should only be administered to penicillin-allergic subjects with similar precautions of penicillin administration to such patients.\r"

Over the course of water diuresis, urinary sodium excretion increased steadily, reaching a 3.5-fold increase in 90 min, but there was no significant change in PGE2 and PGF2 alpha excretion. Inhibition of PG synthesis by naproxen sodium abolished the increase in sodium excretion. Oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin, in submaximal antidiuretic doses, produced marked natriuresis to 2139% and 345% of the control rate, respectively, without a concomitant increase in PG excretion. [Leu4]OT, which is devoid of antidiuretic activity, produced natriuresis and diuresis also without a significant effect on PG excretion. Inhibition of PG synthesis by naproxen attenuated the natriuretic response but enhanced the antidiuretic response to OT. Both the natriuretic and diuretic responses to [Leu4]OT were attenuated. Although the possibility that naproxen may have antinatriuretic activity independent of its PG synthesis inhibitory action cannot be excluded, the data obtained are consistent with our postulate that the natriuretic effect of OT-peptides may be mediated in part via a renal PG mechanism. This postulate is strengthened further by our findings that natriuretic peptides, OT, vasopressin and [Leu4]OT stimulated PG synthesis in kidney homogenates in a dose-dependent manner. Their order of potency is in the same order of their relative natriuretic potencies. [Penicillamine1,Phe(Methyl)2,Thr4,Orn8]OT, an OT antagonist and non-natriuretic, had no significant PG synthesis stimulating activity in the kidney homogenates.\r"

Fibronectin mRNA increased 12-fold in C57Bl/6 mice and only 3-fold in BALB/c mice, whereas alpha 1III procollagen mRNA increased 4-fold in C57Bl/6 mice and 2-fold in BALB/c mice. alpha 2I procollagen mRNA was increased only in C57Bl/6 mice (2-fold). The increases were sequential in C57Bl/6 mice: fibronectin mRNA was elevated first, followed by alpha 2I procollagen, then alpha 1III procollagen mRNA. The temporal relationship between these mRNA elevations and extracellular matrix accumulation, and the exaggerated responses in C57Bl/6 mice, suggest that matrix accumulation is a function of the mRNA levels. Transforming growth factor-beta mRNA relative to total polyadenylated RNA was elevated 5-fold in C57Bl/6 mice and depressed 80% in BALB/c mice 1 week after treatment. Early alterations in transforming growth factor-beta mRNA may contribute to murine strain variation in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and suggest the involvement of transforming growth factor-beta in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is unknown. An autoimmune origin has been suggested. The HLA system is responsible for the synthesis of major histocompatibility antigens and is considered a genetic marker of the risk of or resistance to some diseases. Recently, the association between some antigens of the HLA system and diseases of proven autoimmune origin has been reported. A possible association between antigens of the HLA system and VLS has been investigated by others, with contradictory results. Here we report the results of HLA typing in 68 women with histologically proven VLS. The following antigens were tested: A1, A2, A3, A9-11, A28, A29, A32, B5, B7, B8, B12-B18, B21, B22, B27, B35, B40, Cw1-4, Dr1-5 and Dr7. The results were compared with the frequency of HLA antigens in about 2,000 controls. Patients affected by VLS showed an increased frequency of HLA-B21 (22.06% vs. 9.56%, P less than .001), HLA-Dr5 (55.38% vs. 40.92%, P less than .025) and HLA-Dr7 (38.46% vs. 25.19%, P less than .025). After correction for the number of antigens tested (44) the difference in HLA-B21 frequency was significant at the P less than .05 level. This finding gives further support to the suggestion that an immune system disorder is involved in the origin of VLS.\r"

Glomeruli isolated from normotensive diabetic rats produced greater than normal amounts of PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha under in vitro incubation conditions. In 2K1C hypertensive-diabetic rats, glomeruli from unclipped kidneys (which are prone to accelerated diabetic glomerular injury) produced similarly elevated amounts of PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha, which significantly exceeded the levels produced by glomeruli from clipped kidneys (which are relatively protected from glomerular injury), despite exposure to a similar diabetic environment. In contrast, glomeruli from both unclipped and clipped kidneys of 2K1C hypertensive-non-diabetic rats produced normal amounts of PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha. These results suggests a correlation between vasodilator prostaglandin metabolism and susceptibility to diabetic glomerular injury, and illustrate that enhanced glomerular prostaglandin production is not an invariable metabolic consequence of hyperglycemia or insulin deficiency. The data also demonstrate that hemodynamic as well as metabolic factors may influence glomerular prostaglandin metabolism in experimental diabetes mellitus.\r"

In this study, the kinetics of plasma lipoproteins were investigated in four patients with nephrotic hyperlipidemia, and repeat studies were carried out in three of these patients during therapy with lovastatin. Before lovastatin therapy, the patients had an extremely delayed catabolism of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) without evidence of overproduction of lipoproteins in this fraction. Three of four patients had elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) that were due mainly to increased production rates for LDL. In the three patients treated with lovastatin, the drug therapy lowered plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, and raised high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Lovastatin therapy decreased VLDL-triglycerides primarily by enhancing their catabolism, and lowered LDL-cholesterol levels mainly by reducing input rates for LDL. Overall, lovastatin appears to be an effective drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in the nephrotic syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormones are thought to modulate gene expression positively or negatively through interactions with chromatin-associated receptors. Recently, the c-erb A proto-oncogene products have been shown to be nuclear thyroid hormone (T3) receptors (TR) by sequence similarity with other steroid receptors and by their ability to bind thyroid hormone. But it has not been shown that these receptors directly activate transcription of the responsive genes in vivo. In addition, the rat TR alpha gene encodes several messenger RNA (mRNA) species, generated by differential processing of its transcripts (ref. 22). For these reasons we investigated the ability of two major isoforms of the rat TR alpha gene products to activate transcription of a sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (mHC) gene, because expression of all members of this gene family is responsive to T3. We show here that the rTR alpha 1 receptor is a thyroid hormone-dependent transcriptional factor, which upon binding the T3 responsive element of the alpha-mHC gene, activates expression of this gene in vivo. The rTR alpha 2 isoform, which is identical to rTR alpha 1 except for its carboxyl terminal portion, is generated by alternative splicing of the rTR alpha gene transcript. This peptide, when produced in vitro and in vivo failed to bind T3 or other hormones or to trans-activate alpha-mHC gene expression. Thus, alternative splicing can produce marked differences in the functional properties of a transcriptional factor.\r"

Two distinct functions of the protein are required for its activity: one directs sequence-specific DNA binding, and another interacts with some other component of the transcriptional machinery, for example, RNA polymerase II or a TATA-binding protein. Two short regions of GAL4 function as 'activating sequences' when attached to the DNA-binding portion of GAL4 and these regions can be replaced by a large number of peptides encoded by Escherichia coli genomic DNA fragments or by a synthetic peptide designed to form an amphiphilic alpha-helix. All of these activating sequences, like that found in another yeast activator, GCN4 bear an excess negative charge. GAL4 and its derivatives that are active in yeast stimulate transcription in mammalian cells when GAL4 binding sites are introduced upstream of a mammalian gene; similarly, GAL4 activates transcription in Drosophila cells. Here we show that GAL4 derivatives stimulate gene expression in plant cells.\r"

CA 125 levels were elevated transiently during menstruation, suggesting that blood samples taken during menstruation can give a false-positive result. Whereas the CA 125 values during the nonmenstrual part of the cycle were significantly higher in the patients with adenomyosis and advanced endometriosis (stages III and IV) than in those with a normal pelvis, there was no difference between the patients with mild endometriosis (stages I and II) and the normal-pelvis group. CA 125 levels during menstruation were significantly elevated, not only in women with adenomyosis and advanced endometriosis, but also in those with mild endometriosis, compared with those with a normal pelvis.

An attempt has been made to establish which specific clinical signs and symptoms, as determined by arthrography, best predict the condition of the joint. Our findings suggest that most of the clinical signs and symptoms are not sufficiently reliable in themselves to permit prediction of the condition of the meniscus. Those clinical parameters that did show a strong correlation were tested in combinations using stepwise discriminant analysis to evaluate clinical tendencies. Thus, patients with normal meniscal position and function were often noted to have normal mandibular ranges of movement, no joint noises on opening and closing of the jaw, and no tomographic evidence of degenerative joint disease. Subjects with meniscal displacement with reduction were often found to have joint clicking, deviation of the jaw upon opening, and an absence of degenerative joint disease by multidirectional tomography. Patients who had meniscal displacement without reduction were often found to have limitation in jaw movement, crepitation on opening and closing of the jaw, and associated degenerative changes on multidirectional tomograms. If specific treatment plans are to be tailored for different stages of TMJ internal derangements, clinical findings alone or clinical findings in conjunction with plain radiographs of the TMJ are not consistently accurate.\r"

  ".W": "The hematologic status of 144 consecutive patients in the United Kingdom with oral disease (69 with recurrent aphthous stomatitis; 75 with other disorders) was examined in an attempt to resolve the controversy as to whether levels of hemoglobin, blood cell numbers and indices, and blood film are adequate in the screening of patients with aphthae. Though hemoglobin levels and red blood cell indices were normal in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis, there was still a small minority of patients with deficiencies of iron (low serum ferritin), folate (low red blood cell levels), or vitamin B12 (low serum levels) that would have remained undetected. Full hematologic screening of patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis thus reveals latent deficiency states, at least in some parts of the world, and there are good reasons for elucidating the underlying cause and correcting these deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 deficiency. Therapeutic studies are now required to establish the frequency with which deficiencies actually predispose to recurrent aphthous stomatitis.\r"

An additional 50 patients with disorders of the masticatory system other than disk displacement were examined, as well as a group of 50 subjects without any signs or symptoms involving the masticatory system. The results showed that 22 patients (4 with reversible and 18 with permanent disk displacement) failed to move the mandible without tooth contact toward a predetermined direction and, instead, moved it in the opposite direction. The persons themselves were convinced that the direction of movement was correct. If finger pressure was applied to the joint area on the affected side, 25% of the patients with loss of directional control were able to move correctly. A normalization of the directional control was attained in 20% of the cases if lateral movements were performed with light tooth contact. All the patients with disorders of the masticatory system other than anterior disk displacement demonstrated a correct lateral mandibular movement pattern. In the control group, 2% demonstrated incapability of directional control of lateral jaw movements. The results indicate that loss of directional control of the lower jaw is associated with disk displacement.\r"

These roots, which were resected for periodontal reasons, were examined both under the scanning electron microscope and histologically. Examination with the scanning electron microscope revealed that all four cones were moderately to severely corroded. Histologic examination of two teeth disclosed corrosion products along the entire wall and, in one instance, within the dentinal tubules and apical tissue. The corrosion products, however, were most extensive in the cone that appeared to be loose fitting within the canal. The results indicated that corrosion products occurred in all of the teeth examined. Therefore, corrosion may not be the primary factor accounting for failure in teeth endodontically treated with silver cones.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare diagnostic value of conventional radiographic and xeroradiographic images of experimentally fractured teeth. Forty-five extracted human single-rooted teeth were used. The roots of the teeth were coated with wax to simulate periodontal ligament and invested in acrylic to the cementoenamel junction. An access cavity was prepared and para-post, size 4 to 12 mm, was placed into the root canal. Each tooth with post was placed on the load cell table of an Instron testing machine. The Instron continuously recorded load on a moving graph paper. The load was increased until the tooth fractured. Determination of fracture was made by the sound of a sharp \"crack\" and by a sudden release of load on the post, as seen on the Instron recording graph. After fracture, conventional radiograph and xeroradiograph were obtained for each tooth by use of the paralleling technique. The x-ray beam angle, film distance, and tooth placement were held constant in both techniques by use of a Rinn instrument. All films were evaluated by use of light from a masked viewbox, while all of the xeroradiographs were viewed in reflected light. A magnifying glass was used to aid in the examination process. The samples were examined and categorized for root fracture by the examiners with the use of the following scores: 0 = unacceptably poor, 1 = poor but diagnostic, 2 = adequate for diagnostic information, and 3 = optimal for diagnostic information.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tenderness thresholds of tender points were coded and analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, for factors sex, normal/fibromyalgia, and side, rater, and time 1/time 2. There was significantly lower tenderness thresholds of tender points in fibromyalgia compared to normal subjects. Generalizability coefficients were calculated and showed high inter-rater (0.85), and test-retest (0.85) reliability. Highly significant differences were found between specific tender points. A further 10 normals and 10 fibromyalgia subjects were then examined for 5 paired tender points and 5 paired non-tender points. A 2-way ANOVA was conducted for summed and averaged scores for all tender and non-tender points, with factors normal/fibromyalgia and tender/non-tender; again, there was a large difference between normal and fibromyalgia subjects, and between tender and non-tender points. The interaction was small but significant, but there was a larger difference between fibromyalgia and normal subjects observed on non-tender points. The low tenderness threshold observed at the tender points of fibromyalgia patients may reflect a more generalized lowering of tenderness thresholds, seen at non-tender points as well.\r"

Glycogen depletion was again accomplished with 2 d of carbohydrate restriction (2.52 MJ/d [602 kcal/d], 85% protein, and 15% fat). Glycogen storage capacity in man is approximately 15 g/kg body weight and can accommodate a gain of approximately 500 g before net lipid synthesis contributes to increasing body fat mass. When the glycogen stores are saturated, massive intakes of carbohydrate are disposed of by high carbohydrate-oxidation rates and substantial de novo lipid synthesis (150 g lipid/d using approximately 475 g CHO/d) without postabsorptive hyperglycemia.\r"

Following intravenous doses of 1.0 mg/kg every eight hours to 7.5 mg/kg every four hours, zidovudine plasma levels decay in a biexponential manner, indicating two-compartment pharmacokinetics. The mean half-life was 1.1 hours over this dose range and the total body clearance was approximately 1,900 ml/minute/70 kg, up to doses of 5 mg/kg. At 7.5 mg/kg, total body clearance decreased by 35 percent. The 5'-O-glucuronide was identified as a major metabolite of zidovudine in plasma and urine. This inactive metabolite is rapidly formed and cleared from plasma, with a half-life of one hour. No other metabolites have been found in humans. Renal clearance of zidovudine was estimated at 350 ml/minute/70 kg. Zidovudine penetrated the blood brain barrier as indicated by a cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio averaging 0.5, determined two to four hours after dosing. Following oral administration of zidovudine at doses from 2.0 mg/kg every eight hours to 10 mg/kg every four hours, peak plasma levels increased proportionately with dose; the average bioavailability was 65 percent. Since 90 percent of the drug was recovered in the urine as zidovudine or the 5'-O-glucuronide, the incomplete bioavailability is assumed to be the result of first-pass metabolism rather than incomplete absorption. Pharmacokinetic questions related to optimal use of the drug are currently being addressed.\r"

Of the eight, six were infected at birth and two were contaminated by blood transfusion at ages eight and nine years, respectively; seven of the eight showed specific neurologic impairment consisting of encephalopathy (six children) and myelopathy (one child). In two children, a dramatic improvement of clinical status occurred, including neurologic progress in one; in three, the improvement was dissociate or transient and in the other three, no modification was observed. A marked increase of total lymphocyte and CD4(+) cell counts occurred in four children but was transient without modification of in vitro antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation; p24 human immunodeficiency virus serum antigens were detected in seven of eight children, then transiently disappeared in all children during intravenous therapy but reappeared progressively during the oral regimen in all but one. Progressive modification of human immunodeficiency virus serology was noted in five children, mainly characterized by the finding of anti-core antibodies. The hematologic toxicity of zidovudine was comparable with that observed in adults. These preliminary results support the need for further studies in order to delineate the optimal regimen of zidovudine in children with AIDS.\r"

Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome had significantly higher mean serum triglyceride levels, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Differences in body weight do not explain the male pattern of lipoprotein lipid concentrations in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

The effects of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were noted at 10(-6) mol/L concentrations, which are close to the normal plasma levels of this compound. For the purpose of comparison, the effects of estradiol at 10(-8) mol/L and those of unconjugated dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone acetate, 5-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol, or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone were evaluated at 10(-8) to 10(-8) mol/L concentrations in parallel experiments. All of the delta 5-C19 steroids tested enhanced prostaglandin F2 alpha output at 10(-6) mol/L but not at 10(-8) mol/L; 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone was inactive at 10(-6) mol/L but showed a stimulatory effect at 10(-5) mol/L in two experiments. The stimulation of prostaglandin F2 alpha production by the adrenal steroids was significantly reduced by the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen at 10(-6) mol/L (a finding consistent with the reported utilization of the estrogen receptor for their actions on other systems) but was not affected by the antiandrogen 4-hydroxyflutamide at 10(-6) mol/L. Progesterone (10(-7) mol/L) also lowered the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (10(-6) mol/L) and 5-androstene-3 beta,17 beta-diol (10(-6) mol/L), as well as those of estradiol (10(-8) mol/L). delta 5-C19 steroids at 10(-6) mol/L levels did not antagonize the effect of 10(-8) mol/L estradiol, whereas 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone reduced it by 50% at these concentrations. The significant effect of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone points to potential antiestrogenic effects of the C19 compounds that may be manifested in vivo at particular C19/estradiol concentration ratios. The demonstration of direct estrogenic effects of delta 5-C19 steroids, which are not significantly converted to estrogens in vivo, justifies their use in estrogen replacement preparations and indicates that aromatase inhibitors may not eliminate completely the stimulation of estrogen-responsive breast and endometrial tumors by the patient's adrenal steroids.\r"

Detailed immunological investigations were undertaken before and after treatment and no change was found to account for his improvement.

D-alpha-tocopheryl succinate (vitamin E succinate), which did not increase cAMP level, reduced the survival of heated cells to a greater degree than with vitamin E succinate alone. The presence of vitamin E succinate for the entire experimental period (during heat and observation period) was necessary for this effect. R020-1724 in combination with vitamin E succinate was more effective in reducing the survival of heated cells than the individual agents. Although prostaglandin (PG) A2 did not increase cAMP level in melanoma cells, it decreased the survival of heated cells when present during heat treatment. Other forms of PG such as PGE1 and PGF2 alpha were ineffective. The combination of R020-1724 with two non-cAMP stimulating agents, PGA2 and vitamin E succinate, decreased the survival of heated cells by about 94% of control. These results suggest that the heat sensitivity of melanoma cells can be increased by cAMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms.\r"

Five patients underwent two aspirations each; thus, the total number of aspirates reviewed was 56. Aspirations were performed by interventional radiologists using fluoroscopic guidance. The cytologic features of osteosarcoma were divided into five groups: (1) pleomorphic (malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like); (2) epithelioid; (3) chondroblastic; (4) small cell; and (5) mixed. Although osteoid-like material was seen, it could not be distinguished readily from dense collagen. The chondroid matrix of chondroblastic osteosarcoma was recognized as a granular film with scattered clear bubbles. Fine-needle aspiration was diagnostic of sarcoma in 45 of 56 aspirates (80.4%). In eight aspirates, the cellularity of the smears was insufficient for diagnosis due to extensively osteoblastic tumors (six), necrotic tumor (one), and undetermined causes (one). In three aspirates, failure was attributed to poor cellular preservation due to unknown factors. The authors conclude that FNA is a useful tool in the multidisciplinary diagnosis and management of osteosarcoma. Aspirates should only be evaluated with full knowledge of the clinical and radiographic findings. The most significant limitation of FNA is the inability to detect osteoid.\r"

Staining was performed with hematoxylin-eosin, toluidine blue, and by monoclonal antibodies against Ia-antigen and collagen II. In comparison to the normal matrix, the fracture matrix brought about a more rapid bone formation counted as mineralization after 30 days and formation of ossicles after 30 and 50 days. Matrix from eight-day-old fracture was the most potent inductor compared to matrix from the other post-fracture intervals (one, five, and 11 days). Typical for the responding cells surrounding the implanted matrix was the abundant occurrence of cells carrying Ia-antigen. The cells penetrating the matrix formed pseudopods and could therefore be characterized as dendritic cells. The higher inductive capacity of fracture matrix might have some importance for the formation of the inductive enchondral callus in normal fracture healing.\r"

This fragment, H-Ucp-0.5, contained two intronic regions and two exonic regions. Exonic regions encoded a sequence of 84 amino acids which exhibited a strong homology with central domain at rat UCP. The organization of H-Ucp-0.5 was confirmed by SI mapping analysis. 3. A Southern analysis suggested that the gene is single type in the human, as it is in rodents. 4. In Northern analysis experiments, H-Ucp-0.5 detected a specific 1.8 kb mRNA in human brown adipose tissue obtained from six patients with phaeochromocytoma and from one patient with a hibernoma.

Selective thromboxane-synthase inhibition significantly reduced basal and postfurosemide (1 h) urinary thromboxane B2 excretion in healthy subjects (65% before and 62% after furosemide) as well as in cirrhotic patients (52% before and 67% after furosemide) without affecting urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha excretion. During the first hour after furosemide administration, OKY 046 administration significantly enhanced postfurosemide water excretion (milliliters per minute) in both healthy subjects (from 8.5 +/- 2.0 to 11.6 +/- 2.1, p less than 0.001) and cirrhotic patients (from 1.1 +/- 0.8 to 4.2 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.005), whereas furesemide-induced natriuresis (microequivalents per minute) was significantly increased only in the latter group (from 973 +/- 125 to 1405 +/- 121, p less than 0.05). Our data indicate that intrarenal thromboxane A2 generation, elicited by furosemide administration, may reduce the effects of the drug on water and sodium diuresis. Such a reduction seems to be more marked in the presence of an activated intrarenal prostaglandin system, suggesting that renal thromboxane A2 may represent an additional factor in conditioning the impaired responsiveness to furosemide, which is frequently observed in cirrhotic patients with ascites.\r"

  ".W": "Antral ulcers account for about half of gastric ulcers in humans. An animal model was developed to produce such ulcers. Indomethacin given subcutaneously to normally fed hamsters produced antral ulcers within 1-5 h, dose dependently. These ulcers penetrated the muscularis mucosae. With repeated administration of indomethacin and longer duration of treatment, the lesions became more severe and most animals died with perforated antral ulcers after 2-5 days. Like indomethacin, aspirin given orally also produced antral ulcers in hamsters. Indomethacin reduced the formation of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha by the antral mucosa, and increased gastric acid output more than twofold. The ulcers were prevented by various antisecretory agents (cimetidine, methscopolamine bromide, and omeprazole), and the antiulcer dose of each of these agents corresponded to the antisecretory dose. By contrast, several prostaglandins prevented the ulcers at very low, nonantisecretory doses. 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 prevented the ulcers at a dose nearly 3000 times lower than the gastric antisecretory ED50. The mechanism by which prostaglandins prevent formation of these ulcers is unknown, but the effect is consistent with cytoprotection, i.e., protection of the gastric mucosa by nonantisecretory doses. Indomethacin-induced antral ulcers appear to depend on two factors: a depletion of prostaglandin content of the antrum and gastric hyperacidity.\r"

Endopeptidase-24.11 was isolated from gastric membranes by immunoadsorbent chromatography using a monoclonal antibody to porcine kidney endopeptidase-24.11. The enzyme was purified with a yield of 1.2 micrograms/g wet wt of fundic muscle. A single polypeptide chain of apparent subunit molecular weight of 90,000 was identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gastric endopeptidase-24.11 hydrolyzed substance P, gastrin-releasing peptide 10, [Leu5] enkephalin, and [Met5] enkephalin by cleavage of peptide bonds on the N-terminal side of hydrophobic amino acids. The enzymatic activity was inhibited completely by phosphoramidon (10(-6) M) and strongly by 1,10-phenanthroline (10(-3) M), but was unaffected by captopril (10(-5) M).\r"

Of the 270 tumors monitored in these patients, only 8% underwent complete clinical and histologic regression. All patients developed moderate to severe acute toxicities, leading five patients to withdraw from the study. Retinoid skeletal toxicity was identified in two patients who were examined after long-term therapy. Lower doses of isotretinoin (0.25 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) were ineffective for chemotherapy but demonstrated a chemopreventive effect in a subset of three patients who received these lower doses for 3 to 8 years. Two of these three patients have been observed after discontinuation of therapy. In one patient with a history of arsenic exposure, only one new tumor has appeared in a 27-month posttreatment observation period; in the other patient with the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, 29 new tumors have appeared within a 13-month period. This suggests that the need for long-term maintenance therapy with isotretinoin for chemoprevention of basal cell carcinoma may depend on the underlying cause of the skin cancers.\r"

In the first study, spinal radiographs of 96 patients who had been treated with isotretinoin for 4 to 9 months were reviewed. The average age of these patients was 25 years, and during treatment or within 2 1/2 years after the end of treatment, 26% of the patients showed progressive formation of small bony spurs consisting of tiny horizontal excrescences that arose at the anterior margin of one or more vertebral bodies adjacent to the intervertebral disk. In a second study, the radiographs of 241 patients with psoriasis who were treated continually for 1 to 2 years with acitretin were examined. Many of these patients had abnormal radiographs at the start of therapy. These preexisting conditions included psoriatic arthritis, degenerative arthritis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Five percent of the patients showed progression of their abnormalities during the study. The difference in the rate of spur formation in the two groups may be due to multiple factors and not simply to retinoid therapy. Because of the extensive amount of preexisting disease in the psoriasis group compared with the relatively normal appearance of the spine in the isotretinoin group, the underlying disease process may be more important than the retinoid therapy. The development of the spinal spurs was not associated with specific clinical symptoms. Since there was no control group, it is unknown whether the spurs would have developed or progressed in the absence of retinoid therapy.\r"

This study shows the importance of initial surface cleaning as a mandatory first step in surface asepsis. All manufacturers emphasize this in their written directions by stating that the products should be used on precleaned surfaces. Based on the inability to remove dried organic material and a lack of effective antimicrobial activity in the presence of accumulated bioburden, preparations containing high concentrations of alcohols (greater than or equal to 70%) should not be used as the sole agent for routine precleaning and disinfection. Properly diluted iodophor, sodium hypochlorite, and complex phenol preparations are superior in comparison with other disinfectants in accomplishing the initial precleaning of surfaces.\r"

Initial transmembrane signals in Th cell hybridomas (2-45-12) and in Th cell lines (A24-17 or A33-7) were monitored by stopped-flow fluorometry with fluorescent probes. It was found that Th cells recognized foreign Ag within 1 s at 25 degrees C on the APC (B10.BR spleen cells or L cells into which I-Ak genes were transferred). Recognition of foreign Ag and the Ia molecule was shown to deliver the initial signals to Th cell hybridomas and T cell lines. First, Th cells had membrane fluidity increased and then calcium was transported from the external medium into the T cells. The initial transmembrane signals to Th cell hybridomas were inhibited by the addition of an anti-I-Ak mAb. None of the initial signals were observed in the absence of either specific foreign Ag or APC.\r"

Other steroids, even in such very low concentrations, and mometasone furoate in higher concentrations, produced systemic effects on Ia+ LC when used for longer than 5 d. The recovery time of Ia+ Langerhans cells is significantly shorter after application of mometasone furoate than after fluocinolone acetonide.

Both procedures resulted in a reduction in symptoms, but differences in postoperative findings were observed. Each procedure resulted in increased translation, with eminectomy patients exhibiting greater opening distances at endstage evaluation. In addition, a greater incidence of residual deviation to the affected side occurred in the majority of high condylectomy patients. Although pain was reduced in both groups, less residual pain was observed in the eminectomy group. Alteration in maxillomandibular centric relation was a rare finding, seen only in two high condylectomy patients. Possible factors contributing to these differences are discussed.\r"

Randomly at one visit the local anesthesia was supplemented with midazolam sedation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and pulse were carried out. At the rate of injection with the dose of midazolam used, no significant desaturation attributable to midazolam sedation was observed. However, short periods of significant desaturation occurred with both procedures.

Biopsies were also taken from three muscles, the superficial anterior temporalis, superficial masseter, and the digastric muscles, of ten normal adult monkeys to determine the fiber composition. Both adult male and female monkeys demonstrated a low percentage of type I fibers in the anterior temporalis (less than 25%), and twice as many type I fibers in the masseter and digastric muscles (40 to 50%). The effect of applying a constant touch-pressure to the dorsal surface of the tongue using an acrylic wedge was studied subsequently in these ten animals. Behaviorally, the animals lowered their mandible more during the first 3 months of adapting to the tactile stimulus, and lowering of the mandible was accompanied by increased electromyographic activity (EMG) of the digastric muscle, but not of the anterior temporalis or masseter muscles. In fiber composition, only the anterior temporalis demonstrated a significant shift in percentage of type I fibers with a decrease during the first 3 months. In cross-sectional area, both the anterior temporalis and digastric muscles demonstrated a significant decrease for type I fibers during the 12 month period. Lowering the postural position of the mandible had more effect on the cross-sectional area of the individual fibers than on the metabolic activity of the muscles.\r"

The karyotypes of melanocytes from primary and metastatic melanomas were all abnormal. The only chromosome change in common between the nevi with abnormal karyotypes and the melanomas was the loss of one copy of chromosome 9 (two of four nevi and four of 11 melanomas, including three from the same patient) or the loss of the short arm of chromosome 9, especially of region 9pter-p22 (three of 11 melanomas).

In addition, HIV1 DNA was identified in the mononuclear cells of five of ten children (2-5 years old) of infected mothers who had become seronegative 12-15 months after birth; among these, four children had only mild clinical features related to HIV infection, while the other had none. HIV1 DNA was shown in all of eight seropositive children with HIV infection and none of fifteen normal seronegative controls. The PCR assay thus provides an early and direct identification of HIV infection in newborn infants and seronegative children born to infected mothers.\r"

In an effort to investigate the role of AA metabolites on the pathogenesis of otitis media, concentrations of AA metabolites were measured in middle ear effusion (MEE) from human and paralleling animal models of otitis media and the effects of inhibitors of AA metabolism, antibiotics, and tympanostomy tube (TT) on the outcome of animal models of OM were studied. Concentrations of AA metabolites in MEE were higher in the younger age group. Levels of PGE2 and LTB4 in MEE seem to represent the degree of inflammation of OM best. Lipoxygenase products seem to be associated with the mucoid type of MEE. In the study of animal models of OM, combined models and ears with TT showed more inflammation than single models and ears without TT. Study of the therapeutic use of inhibitors of AA metabolism, penicillin, and TT showed that lipoxygenase products may be more important in the pathogenesis of OM than the cyclo-oxygenase products, and that the use of a combination of penicillin and corticosteroid produces the best results. It is clear from these studies that arachidonic acid metabolites are important inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of otitis media.\r"

Diethylcarbamazine (300 mg) or placebo was taken orally once a week by Peace Corps volunteers serving in Gabon, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic. The participants were assessed clinically and with serologic and parasitologic testing before and yearly during their two years of service. One hundred one persons satisfactorily completed the study. In Gabon (where exposure to the parasite was heaviest), 6 of 20 volunteers (30 percent) in the placebo group had clinical disease, as compared with none of 16 (0 percent) in the diethylcarbamazine-treated group (P less than 0.02). Of those taking placebo, 10 of 20 (50 percent) became seropositive for antifilarial IgG antibody, as compared with 2 of 16 (12 percent) in the drug-treated group (P less than 0.02). Exposure to the parasite appeared to be much lower among the 65 Peace Corps volunteers in Cameroon and the Central African Republic. No volunteer in either group in these countries had overt loiasis; 2 of 40 (5 percent) in the placebo groups in Cameroon and the Central African Republic seroconverted, as compared with none of 25 (0 percent) of those receiving diethylcarbamazine. Occasional nausea was the only symptom significantly associated with the prophylactic drug regimen. We conclude that diethylcarbamazine given orally once weekly can be an effective, acceptable chemoprophylactic agent to prevent loiasis in temporary residents of regions of Africa where Loa loa is endemic.\r"

  ".W": "Progesterone is essential to sustain pregnancy in the first eight weeks. Its synthesis requires the enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-HSD). We tested the efficacy of an orally administered 3-HSD inhibitor, epostane, in terminating unwanted early pregnancy. Fifty women in the fifth through eight weeks of pregnancy took epostane (200 mg orally every six hours) for seven days. By day 14, pregnancy had been terminated in 42 of the 50 patients (84 percent). Eight women (16 percent) did not abort and underwent dilation and curettage. Vaginal blood loss occurred on average on the third day of epostane treatment, and abortion on the fifth day. Two patients had incomplete abortions; one required a transfusion because of blood loss. Nausea was frequent (in 86 percent), but 76 percent of the participants concluded that epostane was preferable to dilation and curettage. The mean (+/- SD) pretreatment progesterone level (76 +/- 16 nmol per liter) decreased by day 7 (to 16 +/- 11 nmol per liter) and day 14 (to 10 +/- 9 nmol per liter) in those who aborted; levels of human chorionic gonadotropin also decreased from the mean at base line (73 +/- 72 kIU per liter) to 18 +/- 7 kIU per liter on day 7 and 9 +/- 5 kIU per liter on day 14. In those who did not abort after epostane treatment, progesterone levels decreased only slightly by day 7 (to 52 +/- 21 nmol per liter) and rose again (to 81 +/- 18 nmol per liter) by day 14. Among women who responded to epostane, normal menstrual periods had resumed by day 42 after the beginning of treatment in 72 percent. We conclude that epostane taken orally is an effective and safe method for the noninvasive termination of undesired early pregnancy.\r"

Eighteen patients had clinical neurologic abnormalities, while the remaining 24 patients were neurologically symptom-free. Nine of the neurologically symptomatic patients at early infection had slight neurologic dysfunction; in nine other subjects at late infection, the neurologic impairment was moderate or severe. When compared with symptom-free patients, neurologically symptomatic patients had increased intra-blood-brain barrier (BBB) HIV-specific IgG (p less than 0.001) and total IgG synthesis (p less than 0.01) with oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the CSF and/or serum (11/18 versus 3/24). At early stages of the infection, neurologically symptomatic patients showed increased total intrathecal IgG synthesis (9/9) coincident with OCBs in the CSF and serum (7/9) and slight mononuclear pleocytosis (7/9), but less frequent HIV-specific IgG production within the CNS (6/9). In advanced infection, the number of neurologically symptomatic patients with intrathecal HIV-specific IgG synthesis (8/9) was higher, while the number of those with increased total intra-BBB IgG synthesis (5/9; p less than 0.01), OCBs (4/9), and increased CSF leukocyte count (1/9; p less than 0.001) was lower than at early infection. Our data suggest humoral intra-BBB immunoactivation at early stages of HIV infection followed by declining B cell response within the CNS at advanced infection.\r"

In osteoblast-enriched fetal rat parietal bone cell cultures, low TGF-beta doses increase DNA synthesis, whereas higher levels are less mitogenic, stimulate collagen production, and decrease alkaline phosphatase activity. Parathyroid hormone by itself has minimal effects on these processes, but it opposes the effects of TGF-beta and alters TGF-beta binding to its receptors in osteoblast-enriched cultures. Some functions ascribed to parathyroid hormone in bone may therefore result from alterations in TGF-beta activity, suggesting that the local effects of TGF-beta in bone are under systemic hormonal control.\r"

The data were grouped in 42 populations studied for 120 alleles. The reconstruction of human evolutionary history thus generated was checked with statistical techniques such as \"boot-strapping\". It changes some earlier conclusions and is in agreement with more recent ones, including published and unpublished DNA-marker results. The first split in the phylogenetic tree separates Africans from non-Africans, and the second separates two major clusters, one corresponding to Caucasoids, East Asians, Arctic populations, and American natives, and the other to Southeast Asians (mainland and insular), Pacific islanders, and New Guineans and Australians. Average genetic distances between the most important clusters are proportional to archaeological separation times. Linguistic families correspond to groups of populations with very few, easily understood overlaps, and their origin can be given a time frame. Linguistic superfamilies show remarkable correspondence with the two major clusters, indicating considerable parallelism between genetic and linguistic evolution. The latest step in language development may have been an important factor determining the rapid expansion that followed the appearance of modern humans and the demise of Neanderthals.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse trisomy 16 has been proposed as an animal model of Down syndrome (DS), since this chromosome contains homologues of several loci from the q22 band of human chromosome 21. The recent mapping of the defect causing familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) and the locus encoding the Alzheimer amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) to human chromosome 21 has prompted a more detailed examination of the extent of conservation of this linkage group between the two species. Using anonymous DNA probes and cloned genes from human chromosome 21 in a combination of recombinant inbred and interspecific mouse backcross analyses, we have established that the linkage group shared by mouse chromosome 16 includes not only the critical DS region of human chromosome 21 but also the APP gene and FAD-linked markers. Extending from the anonymous DNA locus D21S52 to ETS2, the linkage map of six loci spans 39% recombination in man but only 6.4% recombination in the mouse. A break in synteny occurs distal to ETS2, with the homologue of the human marker D21S56 mapping to mouse chromosome 17. Conservation of the linkage relationships of markers in the FAD region suggests that the murine homologue of the FAD locus probably maps to chromosome 16 and that detailed comparison of the corresponding region in both species could facilitate identification of the primary defect in this disorder. The break in synteny between the terminal portion of human chromosome 21 and mouse chromosome 16 indicates, however, that mouse trisomy 16 may not represent a complete model of DS.\r"

  ".W": "We report a mutational analysis of the chicken beta-globin enhancer, using transient expression in primary embryonic erythrocytes. A series of 27 scanning mutants differing only by consecutive 4-base substitutions was tested. Previous experiments, using protection from DNase I digestion, demonstrated four regions in the enhancer that bind factors. Mutations in two of the four regions (denoted I and III) have no effect on enhancer activity. The other two regions (II and IV) mediate all of the positive-acting activity. Region II appears to consist of two subregions, mutation in either of which leads to the same loss in activity as mutation of both. Like region II, mutation of either half of region IV results in reduced enhancer activity. However, in contrast to region II, mutation of both halves of region IV results in more loss of enhancer activity than either single mutation. These data suggest that the half-sites in region II must interact in order to cause enhancement, whereas the half-sites in region IV act independently. Triplications of regions II or IV are able to enhance to a similar degree as the parental enhancer, but single copies of regions II or IV enhance only weakly. Thus, as measured by transient expression in embryonic erythrocytes, the beta-globin enhancer may involve the action of as few as three DNA-binding proteins acting at two sites.\r"

Little is known about the structure of the erythropoietin receptor and the events that follow binding of erythropoietin to its receptor, in part because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient quantities of cells that express the erythropoietin receptor. We used both iodinated and metabolically labeled erythropoietin to characterize the receptor on a variety of erythroleukemia cell lines not previously tested, and we have identified both human and murine cell lines that display large numbers of erythropoietin receptors. Both erythropoietin-responsive and -nonresponsive cell lines exhibit a single class of binding sites. The human erythroleukemia cell line OCIM1 exhibits approximately 3000 erythropoietin receptors per cell with a Kd of 280 pM. The erythropoietin-responsive Rauscher red 5-1.5 murine erythroleukemia cell line displays approximately 1700 receptors per cell with a Kd of 440 pM. The GM979 murine erythroleukemia cell line has approximately 1600 receptors per cell with a Kd of 660 pM. Induction of the erythroid phenotype by dimethyl sulfoxide or its suppression by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was accompanied by an increase or decrease, respectively, in erythropoietin receptor number. Affinity crosslinking of labeled erythropoietin to the receptor identified two proteins corresponding to estimated molecular masses of 95 and 105 kDa. The OCIM1, Rauscher, and GM979 erythroleukemia cell lines provide a useful model for the study of postreceptor signaling events, as well as a convenient source for purification of the erythropoietin receptor.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated overlapping phage genomic clones covering an area of 26 kilobases that encodes the human alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. The alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor gene contains 10 exons and 9 introns distributed over approximately 16 kilobases of DNA. To our knowledge, the number of introns is the highest yet reported for a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. All introns are located in the 5'-half of the corresponding mRNA. The 5'-untranslated region and the leader sequence are interrupted by 3 introns totaling approximately equal to 6 kilobases. A \"TATA box\" sequence is located 17 nucleotides upstream from the proposed transcription initiation site. Multiple \"GC box\" sequences, G + C-rich sequences, and \"CCAAT box\"-like sequence, the hepatitis B virus enhancer element-like sequence and the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer-like sequence appear in the 5'-flanking region. The NH2-terminal region, which implements factor XIII-catalyzed cross-linking of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor to fibrin, is encoded by the 4th exon. The reactive site and plasminogen-binding site, both located in the COOH-terminal region, are encoded by the 10th exon. When similar amino acids of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor and other members of the serpin gene superfamily are aligned, the position of the 7th intron of the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor gene aligns precisely with that of the second intron of the genes for rat angiotensinogen and human alpha 1-antitrypsin genes and is misaligned by only one nucleotide with that of the third intron of antithrombin III, suggesting that the alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor gene originates from the common ancestor of these serine protease inhibitors.\r"

Little is known about the genes that regulate monocytic differentiation. Using clonal variant cells of HL-60 origin, we constructed a cDNA library enriched for genes that are induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3. We now report that in HL-60, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase; D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.11) gene is activated during 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced monocytic differentiation. This gene encodes two closely related mRNAs; one, activated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 at an early stage of HL-60 differentiation, encodes a protein that has homology to mammalian FBPase, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, although it does not exhibit its classical enzymatic activity. A second mRNA is activated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 mainly in peripheral blood monocytes. This mRNA is present in kidney as a unique transcript and encodes a protein with FBPase activity. Our data also show that this FBPase-encoding mRNA can be activated during monocytic maturation since it was detected in human alveolar macrophages.\r"

Unlike antibody to other HIV-1 proteins, the prevalence of antibody to the product encoded by this region is elevated in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Because no analogous coding region has been identified in HIV-2, the antibody to the product of this coding region may serve as a marker to distinguish infection with HIV-1 from infection with HIV-2.\r"

  ".W": "The studies described here tested the hypothesis that the changes in synaptic efficacy produced by phorbol esters in hippocampal slices are equivalent to the long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation. In contrast to the extremely stable synaptic potentiation induced by electrical stimulation, the facilitatory effects of phorbol 12,13-diacetate and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were transient: washout of the drugs restored normal responses in approximately 1-2 and 2-4 hr for phorbol diacetate and phorbol dibutyrate, respectively. It is noteworthy that the more liposoluble of the phorbol esters required longer washout periods. Robust LTP still occurred in response to high-frequency stimulation after washout of phorbol esters and to a lesser degree during their application. Treatment of slices with H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, did not prevent LTP induction although it significantly affected neuronal excitability and produced effects opposite to those of phorbol esters. Finally, phorbol esters altered responses to repetitive stimulation in a way that could account for the reduced LTP elicited in their presence. These results indicate that the increases in synaptic responses caused by phorbol esters and high-frequency electrical stimulation are quite different and thus do not support the hypothesis that activation of protein kinase C, the presumed target of the phorbol esters, triggers LTP.\r"

In the nephrotic syndrome PGE2 excretion rate varied considerably during basal conditions, remission was accompanied by an increase in the PGE2 excretion, and both basal PGF2 alpha excretion rate and the normal response in PGF2 alpha water loading were reduced. A significant, positive correlation was found between urine flow rate and excretion rate of PGE2 in the periods with the largest urine flow rate in both patients and control subjects. It is suggested that a relatively suppressed renal prostaglandin production may be a pathogenetic factor for sodium and water retention in the nephrotic syndrome, although it cannot be excluded that the abnormal prostaglandin excretion pattern is secondary, at least partially, to the reduction of urine flow rate.\r"

Hemodialysis (HD) patients seem to be at high risk for HTLV-1 infection even in other regions of Japan because they sometimes receive multiple blood transfusions. We examined antibody against ATL-associated antigen (ATLA-Ab) in 1,132 HD patients, including 1,066 patients in nonendemic areas (Chubu and Tokyo) and 66 in a highly endemic area (Okinawa). The HD patients in Okinawa showed the highest prevalence, 21.2% (14/66), while those in the Chubu area showed the lowest, 1.1% (10/846), and those in the Tokyo area an intermediate value, 2.7% (6/220). The prevalence of HD patients in each area was significantly higher than that of local blood donors, reflecting an increased prevalence roughly corresponding to the respective endemic rate. The average prevalence of ATLA-Ab among the HD patients was 2.7% (30/1,132), which was similar to that of HBs antigen (3.2%). In the nonendemic areas, 15 of 16 patients with ATLA-Ab had a history of blood transfusions, showing a significant correlation to the presence of ATLA-Ab (P less than 0.01), although four had family histories related to the endemic area. The relative risk of the presence of ATLA-Ab for HD patients with a history of blood transfusions was calculated as 10.3. In the endemic area of Okinawa, the relationship to blood transfusion was not so close, probably masked by the high background prevalence.\r"

Halothane concentrations were also measured in samples taken from the fresh gas outlet and the Y-piece of the circle system during four separate studies in which various components of the anesthesia system were replaced. In each study an Ohio Modulus anesthesia machine equipped with an Air-Shields ventilator was exposed to 2% halothane for 18 h. Anesthetic concentrations were determined by a gas chromatograph having a sensitivity of 0.1 ppm. Isoflurane washed out 3-4 times faster than halothane. Residual halothane concentration was approximately equal to tenfold greater when the fresh gas flow was 1 l/min rather than 10 l/min: 194 versus 19 ppm after 1 h of washout. Using a 10-l/min fresh gas flow, halothane concentrations in samples obtained from the Y-piece were similar with original or fresh soda lime but were more than tenfold lower after the fresh gas outlet hose and circle system were replaced (approximately equal to 50 ppm vs. approximately equal to 5 ppm after 5 min of washout).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

CONCLUSIONS: Because the fish oil supplement contributed negligible amounts of cholesterol and saturated fat to the diet, the n-3 fatty acids most likely caused the observed effects. These findings indicate that relatively small amounts of fish oil can have beneficial effects on plasma triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridemic patients, but the increase in LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B levels, and in the LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio suggests the need for careful monitoring of plasma lipoprotein changes during fish oil supplementation, and for a careful evaluation of their long-term benefits.\r"

  ".W": "Enoxacin concentrations in bone were measured in 24 patients without infection and in 7 with osteomyelitis after one or two doses of 400 mg of enoxacin administered orally or intravenously. Enoxacin concentrations were measured in serum and bone (cortical and cancellous) by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The mean concentration in serum was 2.4 +/- 1.0 micrograms/ml (range, 1.3 to 5.2 micrograms/ml) and was highest after two intravenous doses (3.1 +/- 0.9 micrograms/ml). The mean concentration in cortical bone was 1.0 +/- 0.9 micrograms/g (range, 0.4 to 4.8 micrograms/g) and was highest in patients with osteomyelitis (1.3 +/- 1.6 micrograms/g), but this was not statistically significant. The concentration of enoxacin in cancellous bone was significantly higher than that in cortical bone, with a penetration of 82 versus 40%. Oral enoxacin in practical doses can provide significant levels in bone, and further studies are warranted to determine its therapeutic efficacy in osteomyelitis.\r"
