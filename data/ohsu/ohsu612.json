To test this hypothesis and to explore how the pleural pressure gradient might affect inhomogeneity of alveolar pressures, we deflated at submaximal flows excised canine lobes that first were suspended in air and then were immersed in foams that simulated the vertical gradient of pleural pressure. Interregional inhomogeneity of regional transpulmonary pressures was measured with use of an alveolar capsule technique. Flow-dependent inhomogeneity of alveolar pressures was present, with differences in alveolar pressure quickly relaxing to a constant limiting value at each flow. Foam immersion increased inhomogeneity at a given flow. We conclude that factors intrinsic to the lung cause significant inhomogeneity of alveolar pressures at submaximal expiratory flows and that this inhomogeneity is enhanced by the extrinsic gradient of pleural pressure. These observations are consistent with the interdependence of flow proposed by Wilson et al.\r"

We further analyzed the results of these experiments by estimating alveolar volumes (VA) and regional flows from regional transpulmonary pressures, assuming that regional pressure-volume relationships were homogeneous. Deflation at submaximal flows of lungs suspended in air caused significant flow-dependent inhomogeneity of VA that increased as lung volume decreased. Immersion of lungs in stable foams that simulated the gradient of pleural pressure modified the pattern of emptying, but not always to a gravity-dependent sequence. Limitation of regional expiratory flow was often asynchronous during both air suspension and foam immersion. There was no evidence of a common regional flow-volume curve. Submaximal deflation is a complex heterogeneous process, with the interregional pattern of emptying determined by the interaction of factors that are both intrinsic and extrinsic to the lungs.\r"

The lungs were deflated at constant submaximal flows. The slope of phase III diminished with increasing expiratory flow and increased with foam immersion. The onset of phase IV depended on flow, and a terminal decrease in N2 concentration (phase V) was often observed. Simultaneously measured estimates of regional flows and volumes (J. Appl. Physiol. 65: 1764-1774, 1988) were used to further interpret these results. The onset of phase IV at flows greater than quasi-static signified the onset of flow limitation of dependent regions.

Because these changes may be associated with ischemia, the distribution of intestinal blood flow was studied after a thermal injury and compared with the blood flow distribution after hemorrhagic shock. For the thermal injury, anesthetized animals received a standardized 20% body surface area, full-thickness injury and were given intraperitoneal saline resuscitation. By the use of 46Sc- or 141Ce-labeled microspheres, no changes in intestinal and hepatic blood flow occurred after thermal injury. In contrast, a marked redistribution of blood flow was identified after hemorrhagic shock in which a decrease in arterial blood flow was identified to the stomach and to the small and large intestine. Although clinical shock was not present, the cardiac output decreased to a comparable degree in the hemorrhagic shock and the thermal injury. These studies indicate that although physiological changes in intestinal mucosa can be demonstrated after burn injury, these changes are not due to decreases in mesenteric arterial blood flow.\r"

The cardiovascular responses to progressive lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) were studied during unblocked (control) and full blockade (experimental) conditions in 10 endurance-trained (T) and 10 untrained (UT) men, aged 20-31 yr. The experimental conditions included beta 1-adrenergic blockade (metoprolol tartrate), parasympathetic blockade (atropine sulfate), or complete blockade (metoprolol and atropine). Heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow, and cardiac output were measured at rest and -16 and -40 Torr LBNP. Forearm vascular resistance, peripheral vascular resistance, and stroke volume were calculated from these measurements at each stage of LBNP. Blood pressure was maintained, primarily by augmented vasoconstriction, equally in T and UT subjects during complete and atropine blockade. The fall in systolic and mean pressure from 0 to -40 Torr was greater (P less than 0.05) in the T subjects during the unblocked and metoprolol blockade conditions. This reduced blood pressure control during unblocked condition was attributable to attenuated vaso-constrictor and chronotropic responses in the T subjects. We hypothesize that an autonomic imbalance (elevated base-line parasympathetic activity) in highly trained subjects restricts reflex cardiac responses, which accompanied by an attenuated vasoconstrictor response, results in attenuated blood pressure control during a steady-state hypotensive stress.\r"

We compared these parameters in the liver (where macrophages are attached to the endothelium) and in the lungs (where macrophages were mobile on epithelial surfaces). Submicrometric magnetic particles were injected intravenously (1.5 mg/kg) into rats; 94% was taken up by the liver. Rats were also instilled intratracheally (1.0 mg/kg) with the same particles. Ultrastructural analyses showed that almost all particles were ingested by macrophages in both organs. Periodically, the retained particles were magnetized and aligned with an external magnet. After the magnet was removed, the decay of the resulting remanent field (relaxation) was followed for 25 min. Relaxation parameters (t1/2 and lambda 0) in the liver were constant from 30 min to 30 days after particle administration, but relaxation in lungs showed a time-dependent increase during the 1st day due to the slower rate of particle phagocytosis. Relaxation in both organs primarily reflects the motion of particle-containing organelles as they are rotated by the cytoskeleton. Relaxation in the lungs may also reflect cell translocation or even changes in alveolar shape. Clearance of particles from the lungs or liver was measured by following B0 (initial magnetic field strength). After correction for growth, the clearance t1/2 was 17.7 and 27.3 days for the lungs and liver, respectively. Bulk transport of particles is probably a more important clearance mechanism in the lungs than in the liver.\r"

In a double-blind, crossover experiment 11 male runners ingested calcium Pi (176 mmol/day) or placebo for 4 days. On the 3rd treatment day, subjects ran an incremental maximal aerobic capacity test (VO2 max) on a treadmill, and on the 4th day a treadmill run to exhaustion at approximately 70% VO2max. By the 4th day of Pi loading, plasma Pi was significantly higher than control (P less than 0.05); however, erythrocyte Pi, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and O2 half-saturation pressure of hemoglobin (P50) were not elevated. VO2 max was not changed by the treatments (mean 62.9, 64.2, 64.9 ml.kg-1.min-1 for control, Pi, and placebo bouts, respectively) nor was submaximal run time to exhaustion (61.6 min for Pi, 65.5 min for placebo). Stroke volume at steady-state VO2 was decreased with Pi (P less than 0.05), whereas cardiac output tended (P = 0.07) to be lower. Greater arteriovenous O2 difference (P less than 0.05) with Pi suggested a peripheral effect that increased O2 extraction. We concluded that in healthy individuals Pi loading produced no improvement in work tolerance or aerobic capacity but did alter some aspects of cardiovascular function.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of cardiopulmonary (CP) mechanoreceptors in the regulation of arterial blood pressure during dynamic exercise in humans, we measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (Q), and forearm blood flow (FBF) during mild cycle ergometer exercise (77 W) in 14 volunteers in the supine position with and without lower-body negative pressure (LBNP). During exercise, MAP averaged 103 +/- 2 mmHg and was not altered by LBNP (-10, -20, or -40 mmHg). Steady-state Q during exercise was reduced from 10.2 +/- 0.5 to 9.2 +/- 0.5 l/min (P less than 0.05) by application of -10 mmHg LBNP, whereas heart rate (97 +/- 3 beats/min) was unchanged. MAP was maintained during -10 mmHg LBNP by an increase in total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR) from 10.3 +/- 0.5 to 11.4 +/- 0.6 U and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) from 17.5 +/- 1.9 to 23.3 +/- 2.6 U. The absence of a reflex tachycardia or reduction in arterial pulse pressure during -10 mmHg LBNP supports the hypothesis that the increase in TSVR and FVR results primarily from the unloading of CP mechanoreceptors. Because CP mechanoreceptor unloading during exercise stimulates reflex circulatory adjustments that act to defend the elevated MAP, we conclude that the elevation in MAP during exercise is regulated and not merely the consequence of differential changes in Q and TSVR. In addition, a major portion of the reduction in FBF in our experimental conditions occurs in the cutaneous circulation. As such, these data support the hypothesis that CP baroreflex control of cutaneous vasomotor tone is preserved during mild dynamic exercise.\r"

By the use of radioactive microspheres, the blood flow to trachea and to tracheal cartilage, smooth muscle, and mucosa/submucosa was determined along with measurements of blood flow to different sized airway segments and the systemic blood flow to lung parenchyma. Histamine greatly increased blood flow to medium-sized (5- to 10-mm-diam) central airways in which blood flow increased 5-10 times base line, whereas in small (1- to 5-mm-diam) central airways the increase was 10-15 times. Blood flow in tracheal mucosa/submucosa increased six times base line, but in tracheal smooth muscle the increase was only three times base line, and in cartilage it remained at base line. Most of the systemic blood flow to the lung perfuses less than 1-mm-diam peripheral airways, and these airways demonstrated less vasodilation during histamine infusion. Mean blood flow to whole-lung parenchyma (whole lung minus trachea) was only two times base line during histamine infusion. Water content of trachea and main stem bronchi was significantly increased after histamine. Histopathologic findings after histamine infusions included congestion and edema of airways with only minor effects noted in alveoli. We conclude that histamine is a potent and selective vasodilator of bronchial vessels and particularly affects blood flow to central airways and to airway mucosal/submucosa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rat hearts were perfused by the method of Langendorff (Pfluegers Arch. 61: 291-332, 1895) with Krebs-Henseleit medium containing 10 mM glucose. Hearts were equilibrated for 30 min, followed by 90 min of hypoxia or 60 min of hypoxia and 30 min of reoxygenation. The massive enzyme release observed upon reoxygenation after 60 min of hypoxia was prevented by infusing 0.5 or 5 mM cyanide 5 min before reoxygenation. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release commenced immediately upon withdrawal of cyanide. Hearts perfused with calcium-free medium throughout hypoxia did not release increased amounts of LDH at reoxygenation. Perfusing heart tissue with medium containing 0 or 25 microM calcium, but not 0.25 or 2.5 mM, after 50 min of hypoxia initiated a release of cardiac LDH, which was not further enhanced by reoxygenation. Enzyme release was significantly inhibited when the calcium-free perfusion medium included 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose (replacing glucose), 0.5 mM dinitrophenol, or 2.5 mM cyanide. Histologically, hearts perfused with calcium-free medium after 50 min of hypoxia showed areas of severe necrosis and contracture without any evidence of the contraction bands that were seen in hearts reoxygenated in the presence of calcium. Cardiac ATP and creatine phosphate (PCr) levels were significantly decreased after 50-60 min of hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The initial retention of neutrophils within the pulmonary microvascular bed occurs in both physiological and pathological states, yet the factors responsible for this retention are poorly understood. Because the diameter of the neutrophil is approximately 7.03 micron and the mean pulmonary capillary diameter is 5.5 micron, we postulated that geometric constraints imposed by the microvascular bed, the deformability of the neutrophil, and the hydrodynamic characteristics of blood were important determinants of neutrophil retention. We used a filtration system wherein 111In-labeled human neutrophils (111In-N) suspended in a serum-containing buffer were passed through Nuclepore filters of known pore size. Compared with 99mTc-labeled erythrocytes (99mTc-RBC), the passage of 111In-N was delayed and a higher percentage was retained within the filter. Because the neutrophil and RBC are approximately equal in diameter, the deformability of the neutrophil must be less than that of RBC. As the flow rate increased, retention in the filters decreased logarithmically from 72 +/- 5% (flow rate 0.5 ml/min) to 15 +/- 4% (10.0 ml/min). As the number of RBC in the buffer increased, neutrophil retention in 5-micron filters decreased in a linear fashion from 65 +/- 6% at hematocrit of 0 to 33 +/- 2% at hematocrit of 10. The perfusion pressure and shear stress were of critical importance, and there was a logarithmic relationship between retention and perfusion pressure or shear stress (tau), whether the increase in pressure or tau was generated by increasing flow or by increasing the hematocrit of the perfusate. As the pore size of the filter increased, the retention of neutrophils decreased in a logarithmic fashion: from 75 +/- 5% in the 3-micron filter to 4 +/- 1.3% in the 12-micron filter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The excised, washed tracheas were immersed in a solution of phosphate-buffered saline made up in deuterium oxide (D2O, pH 7.3). The images are maps of proton density in the image slice (2.5 mm thick). All but one series of images showed a collapse process in which the trachealis muscle invaginated asymmetrically, i.e., the muscle appeared to favor one side of the cartilage ring system more than the other. The connecting tissue between the cartilage rings appeared to be more compliant than the rings themselves, thus suggesting that the tracheal lumen became corrugated at negative pressures. In the plane of a cartilage ring, the lumen appeared to remain patent at pressures as low as -95 cmH2O. However, between rings, where the tracheal wall was more compliant, the lumen appeared to be totally occluded at -53 cmH2O. Lumen areas in both the plane of the cartilage rings and in a plane between rings were measured from each series of printed images for six tracheas. These measurements, when normalized, averaged, and plotted against transmural pressure gave asymptotic logarithmic compliances (n1 in the model of Lambert et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 52: 44-56, 1982) of 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 20 +/- 7 for the interring and ring regions, respectively. These values are greater than the critical value of 0.5 (J. Appl. Physiol. 62: 2426-2435, 1987) and are thus consistent with wave speed flow limitation being possible anywhere in the trachea during forced expiration.\r"

Comparison of the results of the two methods showed that if fissures and cysts were present in a degenerated anulus fibrosus, but did not establish continuity between the nuclear cavity and the site of a herniation, the discogram was false-negative. Under these circumstances, the inner fiber bundles of the anulus fibrosus were intact and their orientation was often reversed, so that they bulged inward. This finding suggested that a protrusion or a prolapse of tissue from just the anulus fibrosus might have been developing. Ten of the fifty-seven discs that had such changes in the orientation of the fibers had a histologically proved protrusion or prolapse of the anulus fibrosus. However, the discograms showed protrusion in only six of the ten discs and demonstrated a false-negative result in the other four. The cases of seventy-seven patients in whom discography had been performed and a herniation had been subsequently confirmed at operation were also studied. Fifty-nine of the patients had a protrusion and eighteen had a prolapse of the disc. The discograms were falsely interpreted as negative in 32 per cent (nineteen) of the fifty-nine patients who had a protrusion and in 56 per cent (ten) of the eighteen who had a prolapse. Histologically, the prolapses were interpreted as protrusions of a portion of the anulus fibrosus. It was concluded that false-negative discograms are more frequent when a protrusion or a prolapse involves the anulus fibrosus rather than the nucleus pulposus, and that a negative discogram does not exclude the possibility of extensive degeneration of the anulus fibrosus.\r"

The number of secondary operations was much higher in the patients who were treated with Ender pins, and a considerably higher number of those patients had loss of fixation. The use of Ender pins that were too long and a history of a fracture before the operation in which Ender pins were used were statistically significant predictors of secondary operations.\r"

All of the patients were more than thirty-five years old. Twenty-nine of them were initially presumed to have had an injury to the axillary nerve, although this injury was confirmed in only four of the twenty patients who had electrodiagnostic studies. In eight patients, the subscapularis tendon and anterior part of the capsule had ruptured from the lesser tuberosity. Recurrent instability developed in all eight patients, and repair of these structures alone was successful in restoring stability. The association between primary anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint and rupture of the rotator cuff in the older patient who cannot abduct the arm after reduction is poorly appreciated, as it is often missed. In our series of such patients, the incidence of injury to the axillary nerve was 7.8 per cent, as compared with 100 per cent for rupture of the rotator cuff. However, the comparative rates of occurrence of these two entities in older patients who have an anterior dislocation have not been determined.\r"

With one exception, all patients functioned as well as uninjured subjects of comparable age. Patients who have a compression fracture of a vertebra should have serial radiographs made for at least three months to ensure that all fractured vertebrae are identified and to document any progression of deformity.\r"

Culture of fluid that had been aspirated from the joint preoperatively and culture of a biopsy specimen were negative. Biopsies of specimens of synovial material revealed tuberculous granuloma in all patients, despite negative findings for acid-fast organisms. The prosthesis was implanted with cement in four knees and without cement in eighteen. The mean functional rating was 39 points preoperatively and 83 points at the time of final follow-up. No component loosened. One patient had an arthrodesis because of recurrent active tuberculous infection. Two other patients had recurrence of the infection, which was controlled satisfactorily in one by chemotherapy alone and in the other by chemotherapy and debridement of a sinus tract, without removal of the prosthesis.\r"

We paid particular attention to the effect of a delay in giving the antibiotic. The frequency of osteomyelitis in the animals in a control group (no antibiotic) was 91 per cent. When a single injection of cephradine was given one hour before inoculation with the bacteria, the rate was 30 per cent, a statistically significant reduction (p less than 0.01). When cephradine was not administered until one to four hours after inoculation with the bacteria, the average rate of osteomyelitis was 51 per cent, a 40 per cent reduction compared with the rate for the control group. The effect of the antibiotic therefore persisted even when the initial dose was delayed for four hours after bacterial inoculation.\r"

It has also been suggested that such studies should focus more on the outcome in terms of the health of the patients rather than primarily on procedural or technical concerns. To test the validity of these criticisms, ten published reports on the surgical treatment of patients who had a selected diagnosis were reviewed to evaluate the strategies that had been used in the design of the study and the outcome in terms of the patient's health. Ten articles on the long-term follow-up of patients after primary total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of osteoarthritis, published in peer-reviewed journals, were examined to determine the strategies that had been used in the design of each study and the methods of reporting the outcomes. All ten articles were found to be deficient in terms of design, to be flawed by confusing data, and to contain results of doubtful validity. The emphasis in the reported outcomes was predominantly on the status of the prosthetic device instead of on the health of the patients in whom the prosthetic device had been used. Authors, journals, program committees, and professional societies must share the blame for the publication of flawed studies that are designed using inappropriate strategies. In the future, reports on orthopaedic clinical research must focus more on the health of and the economic benefits to the patients and less on the outcome of the technology that was used in providing the services.\r"

In all four papers, grave deficiencies were identified. Finally, the effects of some controlled clinical trials in other surgical disciplines were briefly reviewed. On the basis of the findings in this study, it was concluded that adequate surgical trials should be completed before new procedures or new designs of prostheses, such as those used in hip-joint arthroplasty, are made available for general use.\r"

Six of the seven refractures were in patients who initially had had a fracture of both bones, and all were in patients in whom the original fracture had been caused by major trauma. The interval from the time of removal of the plate to refracture ranged from forty-two to 121 days. Only one of the seven patients who had a refracture had had adequate compression of the original fracture. The average interval from the time of the original trauma to internal fixation was two days in six patients who had a refracture and who originally had had primary plating, compared with 8.5 days in the patients who did not have a refracture. One of the seven patients who had a refracture had originally had delayed plating after closed treatment had failed. In retrospect, radiolucency at the site of the original fracture was seen in most patients when the plate was removed.\r"

An intravenous injection of bacteria alone produced no morphological or microbiological evidence of infection. In the absence of trauma, normal tibiae were sterile after forty-eight hours. Foreign-body particles have been shown to accumulate in the fine vessels that are adjacent to the growth plate, but we found no similar deposition of bacteria or evidence of phagocytic removal in this area. Phagocytosis of bacteria by neutrophils did not appear to be impaired in the distal third of the metaphysis, but a delayed inflammatory response that allowed proliferation of bacteria and destruction of tissue was observed in the proximal two-thirds of the metaphysis after trauma.\r"

  ".W": "From March 1980 to July 1986 at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Padua, 182 patients underwent 210 carotid revascularizations for atherosclerotic stenosis involving the carotid bifurcation (28 operations were bilateral). Carotid endarterectomies (CE) and patch graft angioplasty totalled 192 (166 patients); an enlarging patch graft angioplasty of the internal carotid artery (ICA) without CE was performed in 14 cases (13 patients); in the remaining four surgical procedures (3 patients), for technical reasons prohibiting CE, the operation consisted of a great saphenous vein bypass between a donor vessel and the ICA distal to the lesion. The preoperative symptoms in 182 patients were as follows: TIAs (98 cases, 54%), non-hemispheric symptoms (21 cases (12%) and fixed stroke or TIAIR (10 cases, 5%). Fifty-three patients (29%) were asymptomatic. In all cases, continuous EEG monitoring was employed. The operation was performed without a temporary intraluminal shunt in the patients showing tolerance to carotid clamping. The protection of the shunt was required only in patients with EEG changes (47 cases). The arteriotomy was routinely closed with a PTFE patch graft angioplasty. Early results of the operation were excellent: none of the patients presented permanent or transient neurological deficits in the immediate postoperative period and none of them died. All patients were reassessed with C.W. Doppler sonography and Duplex scanning in the postoperative period. In all cases, the success of the operation was demonstrated. Longterm follow-up (6-72 months, mean follow-up: 35 months) was done in 121 patients (142 operations): 107 patients were completely asymptomatic, 5 remained stable or slightly improved the preoperative status. Five patients had a new or recurrent TIAs, 3 suffered a stroke, one showed a recurrence of non-hemispheric symptoms. With the exception of two patients suffering a stroke, all had a second arteriography but none of these patients showed extracranial lesions. Two patients presented an asymptomatic restenosis of the ICA. Eight patients (8.8%) revealed a significant evolution of the disease of the contralateral unoperated ICA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "From March 1967 to February 1985, ninety one patients aged from eleven months to 53 years underwent surgical treatment of isolated coarctation of the aorta. On reviewing the long term results it was found that persistence of hypertension was related to the age when the operation was performed. Dividing the patients into three age groups; group I: 0-5 years, group II: 6-15 years and group III: over 15 years, it was found that there was no late hypertension in group I while hypertension persisted in 11% in group II and 25% in group III. Fifty per cent of the patients with persistent hypertension were above the age of 20 years at the time of operation. The need for graft replacement was related to age of the patients and to the anatomy of the coarctation being used more frequently in older patients and in those where the coarctation was at the junction of the arch and the descending aorta or proximal to that site. Because of this relationship to the anatomy, the coarctations were classified into 4 types. The surgical procedures performed were: resection with end to end anastomosis, resection with replacement by a tube graft, patch and bypass grafts, in descending order of frequency. Eighty six patients have been followed up (mean 10 years). There was no hospital or late mortality (one patient committed suicide one year after operation) and none of the patients suffered from spinal cord injury. There were three recurrent coarctations in patients who had primary reconstruction under one year of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The persistence of collateral circulation was evaluated one year after the correction of experimental aortic coarctation (CoA) by assessing renal perfusion with the Xenon 133-washout method and measuring distal aortic blood pressure during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta. CoA was created in 7 puppies at 2 months of age and was corrected after a follow-up with a venous patch when the dogs were 9 months old. Two of the dogs were lost during the corrective operation due to anaesthetic complications. Four sham-operated dogs served as controls. One year after correction of CoA, four of the dogs had a pressure gradient of less than 5 mmHg at the site of CoA and one a pressure gradient of 15 mmHg. In renal perfusion measurements a mean decrease of 49% and 96% was found in the study and control groups, respectively. Blood pressures in the distal aorta decreased 47% and 83%, respectively. Two dogs in the study group had a distal blood pressure under 50 mmHg and their renal perfusion decreased markedly. Collateral circulation decreased with time after a good anatomic correction of CoA, so that one year after correction of experimental CoA about one half of the initial collateral capacity remained. This suggests that in most reoperations performed at least one year after the primary corrections, temporal shunting or a left side bypass is necessary to ensure sufficient circulation in the distal organs.\r"

The blood volume that filled the leg veins on standing from recumbent position (venous volume [VV]) in ml and the time needed for 90% filling of the veins (venous filling time [VFT90]), in seconds were measured. The ratio 90% of VV/VFT90 was defined as venous filling index (VFI) in ml/sec. VFI is a measurement of reflux. The measurements were repeated with a 2.5 cm wide tourniquet (T) placed at the knee level to occlude the superficial veins only. The method, apart from its diagnostic accuracy, can measure reflux separately in the superficial and the deep venous system and has indicated that the magnitude of reflux is related to chronic swelling and ulceration of the leg, irrespective of whether it is in the superficial or deep system.\r"

Edema developed in all but one patient, being more prominent in those with a saphenous graft with the popliteal anastomosis below the knee. Phlebography confirmed venous obstruction in one case. Contrast and scintigraphic lymphograms disclosed several degrees of lymphatic damage (disruption of the vessels and extravasation) in all instances, which correlated with the extent of surgical dissection and the development of postoperative edema. There was good agreement between the two lymphatic imaging techniques.\r"

Patients in the IFT group had a significantly prolonged hospital stay (p less than .05) and a significantly lower mean weight (129 lbs) when compared to the PCT group (173 lbs) (p less than .05). Pain was present equally among the three groups. Swelling was much more common in the SFV group, whereas tenderness was most frequent in the PCT group. Of those patients with swelling, 70% were in the SFV group and of those patients with tenderness, 60% were in the PCT group. DVT as the primary diagnosis was seen in 39% of cases of which half had disease limited to the PCT region. Post-op DVT occurred equally among the groups. DVT occurred much more frequently in the PCT region after myocardial infarctions and after orthopedic procedures, whereas in patients with malignancies, the most common site was the SFV region. Pulmonary embolism developed in 11% of patients and occurred in the IFT and SFV groups only.

There was a significant increase in P50 in patients (Group II) who received autologous blood when compared with Group I patients who received banked blood (p less than 0.001). Our data on P50 in Group I patients who received banked blood showed that there was a significant decrease confirming the results of previously published studies.

Four patients, aged 39 days, 41 days, 2 months and 3 months, survived and showed uneventful postoperative hemodynamics. Two of the three non-survivors were considered retrospectively to have been unsuitable candidates for Jatene's anatomic repair due to their low left ventricular pressure (LV/RV pressure ratio less than 0.60 in both). The remaining infant who died had TGA with a large ventricular septal defect of the muscular type and developed a postoperative residual shunt. It was considered unreasonable to attribute the cause of death in this case to inadequate myocardial protection. Judging from our experience with these four survivors who underwent prolonged aortic clamping ranging from 117 to 160 minutes, our cardioplegic solution and the technique of its administration were considered to be effective and promising for heart surgery in young infants and neonates.\r"

All underwent diaphragmatic plication (DP). DP was performed late in 7 cases (Group Ia) with a mean time of 30.8 days between surgery and DP, and early in 3 others (Group Ib) with a mean time of 10.2 days. Eight children (Group II), older than 1 year, tolerated PNP better and could be extubated early without diaphragmatic plication. In Group Ia severe lung infections were recorded in 5 before or/and after DP, and two died at 3 and 30 days after plication. Five children from Group Ia and all 3 from Group Ib were late survivors. They could be weaned from ventilatory support in a mean time of 3 days after DP, although those with severe lung infection (Group Ia) took the longest time. All from Group II were late survivors. We conclude: PNP is well tolerated without plication in children older than 1 year. However early DP offers excellent and immediate results in infants with PNP. Early DP in these children avoids or reduces severe lung infections and death.\r"

The lipolytic activity of isolated sc fat cells was measured before and after a period of exercise in trained and sedentary women with a similar body mass index values [20.4 +/- 0.5 (+/- SE) and 21.3 +/- 0.5 kg/m2] and an equivalent mean fat cell volume (0.216 +/- 0.022 vs. 0.278 pm 0.026 nL). Before exercise, compared with those of sedentary women, the adipocytes of trained women had greater lipolytic responsiveness to catecholamines and beta-agonists; moreover, dibutyryl cAMP had greater lipolytic efficiency on the adipocytes of the trained women. These results suggest that the differences in responsiveness of the adipocytes from sedentary and trained women are due to functional differences at a postreceptor level of the lipolytic cascade. The lipolytic (beta-adrenergic) and antilipolytic (alpha 2-adrenergic) responses of the adipocytes from both groups did not change after the period of physical activity. These results demonstrate, whatever the physical condition of the subjects, that desensitization of beta- and alpha 2-adrenergic responsiveness does not occur after a period of intense physical activity which promotes physiological activation of the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of phenotypic markers and Concanavalin-A-induced suppressor activity was compared among mononuclear cells isolated from thyroid glands and peripheral blood of thionamide-treated patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease and peripheral blood from normal subjects. Intrathyroidal lymphocytes were obtained by two different methods (TG-1 and TG-2 cells), gradient centrifugation of supernatants of minced thyroid tissue and overnight culture of thyroid debris after mechanical disaggregation and enzymatic digestion, respectively. The percentages of CD3+ cells (all mature T cells) among peripheral blood and TG-1 and TG-2 cells from Graves' patients were similar, but the percentages of B1+ cells (pan B cells) among the TG-1 and TG-2 cells were markedly increased compared to that in peripheral blood. The percentages of CD4+ cells among the TG-1 and TG-2 cells were significantly less than that in peripheral blood. The percentages of CD4+2H4+ cells among CD4+ cells in TG-1 and TG-2 cells also were significantly less than that in peripheral blood. The percentage of CD4+4B4+ cells among CD4+ cells in thyroid glands was markedly higher than that in peripheral blood. The percentages of CD8+ cells and CD8+CD11b- cells (cytotoxic T cells) in thyroid glands were significantly higher than those in peripheral blood from Graves' patients and peripheral blood from normal subjects. The CD8+CD11b+ cells were subdivided into two subpopulations on the basis of CD8 antigen density. The percentage of dull CD8+CD11b+ cells (natural killer cells) among TG-2 cells was lower than that in peripheral blood, but there was no significant difference in bright CD8+CD11b+ cells (suppressor-effector T cells) between thyroid glands and peripheral blood. The percent suppression induced by Concanavalin-A in both TG-1 and TG-2 cells was significantly decreased compared with that in peripheral blood. These results suggest that impairment of suppressor cell activity and an increased number of B cells exist in thyroid glands of patients with Graves' disease compared to those in peripheral blood. It, thus, appears likely that both B cell hyperactivity and suppressor T cell dysfunction may induce excess production of autoantibodies in the thyroid glands of such patients.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable controversy exists concerning the assessment of thyroidal state in critically ill patients with decreased serum T4 and T3 concentrations, in part because serum free T4 values are often low in such patients no matter what method of measurement is used. We developed an ultrafiltration method to measure free T4 and free T3 in undiluted serum and compared the results with those obtained using a standard equilibrium dialysis method to measure free T4 and T3. In 30 consecutive intensive care unit (ICU) patients, serum free T4 values were similar to or higher than those in 12 normal subjects by both methods in most patients and were clearly distinguishable from those in hypothyroid patients. The serum total T4 concentrations in these patients ranged from 12.9-131.3 nmol/L (mean, 68.2; normal mean, 115.8). Free T4 by equilibrium dialysis was highly correlated with free T4 by ultrafiltration in the ICU group (r = 0.91; P less than 0.001). Serum free T3 levels, however, whether measured by equilibrium dialysis or ultrafiltration, were decreased in the ICU patients, confirming other reports of lowered free T3 in critically ill clinically euthyroid patients. Our findings suggest that the use of equilibrium dialysis of undiluted serum or ultrafiltration to measure serum free T4 concentrations will distinguish euthyroid hypothyroxinemic ICU patients from those with hypothyroidism.\r"

Preoperatively, treatment with SMS 201-995 reduced mean 24-h plasma GH concentrations from 8.5-66.7 to below 4.6 micrograms/L in eight patients and by 60-80% in the remaining two patients. Pituitary tumor size decreased 20-54%. Morphologically, the tumors showed decreased total cell, cytoplasmic, and nuclear areas; varying degrees of perivascular fibrosis; and dense granularity. Postoperatively, plasma GH and insulin-like growth factor I concentrations fell into the normal range, and GH dynamics became normal in eight patients. In the remaining two patients mild GH hypersecretion persisted after surgery (mean fasting and random plasma GH, 6.1 and 7.9 micrograms/L), and in one of them GH secretion became normal 1 yr after pituitary irradiation. Thus, preoperative administration of SMS 201-995 consistently induced shrinkage of GH-producing pituitary tumors, and the apparent remission rate was high in the treated patients.\r"

Four monkeys were lean (less than 20% body fat), and four were obese (greater than 35% body fat). The monkeys were given a single bolus injection of GH (2.5 micrograms/kg BW), followed by a constant infusion of GH (250 micrograms/h) for 2.5 h. Venous blood samples were collected before the infusion and every 10 min during the infusion. In both groups a plateau of the plasma GH concentrations, indicating a steady state, was reached 70 min after the start of the infusion. The MCR of GH was calculated from the ratio of the constant GH infusion rate and the plateau plasma GH concentration in each monkey. The MCR of synthetic GH was 12.7 +/- 1.7 (+/- SD) L/24 h in the lean group and 19.5 +/- 2.9 L/24 h in the obese group (P less than 0.007). However, the MCR/kg ratio in the lean monkeys was the same as that in the obese animals. We conclude that 1) MCR of GH is directly proportional to body weight; and 2) the lower plasma GH levels in obesity may be due to an increase in its MCR not compensated for by an appropriate increase in the rate of GH secretion.\r"

Blood samples were collected every half hour for 24 h. Serum PTH was measured by an RIA specific for the midregion of the molecule. The mean circadian pattern for each variable was derived by calculating the average value across all men at concurrent time points. After the data were smoothed by the method of running means, the correlations between PTH and mineral values from concurrent time points were calculated, as were cross-correlations to 12 lag periods (6 h). Spectral and cross-spectral analyses were performed on the same data set. Both statistical methods yielded consistent results: 1) at concurrent time points (0 lag), high correlations were found between serum PTH and Cat (r = -0.74), PTH and Pi (r = 0.79), and PTH and Cai (r = -0.53); and 2) when the PTH series was lagged by 2 h, the PTH/Cai correlation improved to -0.70. A direct PTH/Cai correlation of 0.50 was found when the Cai series was lagged about 4.5 h. No improvement in the correlations were found when the other series were lagged. Spectral analyses also detected significant interrelations between PTH and Cai at 2 and 3.5 h. These data describe the timing of the bidirectional interaction between serum PTH and plasma Cai under steady state conditions in normal adult men; changes in Cai concentrations precede inverse changes in PTH levels by 2 h, whereas changes in PTH precede similar directional alterations in Cai by about 4 h.\r"

Argyrophilic tumor cells in a lymph node removed during operation immunostained for gastrin and ACTH. Treatment for more than 6 months with the somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 (300 micrograms/day) greatly reduced serum gastrin levels and normalized plasma ACTH and cortisol levels and urinary cortisol excretion, and the signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome disappeared. The size of the primary tumor in the head of the pancreas, which had grown rapidly before SMS 201-995 therapy, stabilized after 6 months of treatment with the analog. We conclude that SMS 201-995 can reduce ACTH as well as gastrin secretion from islet cell carcinomas as well as control tumor growth.\r"

When HGP was estimated at hourly intervals from 0800-1300 h, it became evident that calculated values for HGP fell for the first 2-4 h until a plateau was reached, and this decline was quite precipitous during the first 2 h in patients with NIDDM. Furthermore, when the same patient with NIDDM was studied on two occasions, similar values for HGP were not uniformly obtained unless measurements were made at least 4 h after [3-3H] glucose administration. Since it has been the convention to use the nonsteady state equations of Steele to calculate HGP in patients with NIDDM 2 h after [3-3H] glucose administration, it is almost certain that published values for HGP in patients with NIDDM are falsely high. Based upon the data presented, we suggest that HGP using [3-3H]glucose and the nonsteady state Steele equations be measured for at least a 4-h period in patients with NIDDM in order to increase the validity of the calculated value.\r"

  ".U": "89034612\r", 
  ".W": "A 15-month-old boy had clinical features of hyperthyroidism. In spite of elevated serum thyroid hormone levels (mean serum T4, 230 nmol/L; T3, 4.2 nmol/L), serum TSH levels ranged between 3.3-5.6 mU/L and rose to 35.4 mU/L after TRH stimulation. There was no abnormal serum thyroid hormone binding or any evidence of a pituitary tumor. The boy was treated with carbimazole for 6 months and became euthyroid. However, his thyroid size enlarged, and serum TSH rose to 45 mU/L. In an attempt to suppress TSH secretion, 3,5,3'-triiodothyroacetic acid was added to carbimazole in daily doses from 0.7-1.4 mg. This combined therapy failed to suppress TSH secretion (serum TSH, 10.2 mU/L) and led to recurrence of symptoms of hyperthyroidism. A trial using highly purified dextrothyroxine (contamination by L-T4, 0.05%) as sole therapy then was carried out. Serum TSH levels promptly declined to normal, both basally and after TRH stimulation (basal, 2.4 mU/L; peak, 13.8 mU/L). During a 24-month follow-up period, the boy remained euthyroid. Serum TSH levels remained in the normal range, as did his serum L-T4 levels (93 nmol/L). Complete remission was achieved using a 5-mg daily dose of D-T4. Temporary discontinuation of D-T4 led to prompt relapse of hyperthyroidism. Our patient's TSH hypersecretion appears to be due to selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormones. Purified D-T4 effectively inhibited TSH secretion in this patient, without inducing significant side-effects, even when the daily dose was high. The cause of partial pituitary unresponsiveness to thyroid hormones is not known. We suggest that transport of thyroid hormones into the thyrotroph cells could be deficient in our patient.\r"

It is also produced and secreted by nonpregnant endometrial tissue, especially during the late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. We studied the localization of this protein in the endometrium during different phases of the cycle using immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies. Immunostaining was first observed in the midsecretory phase and was most consistently detected during the late secretory phase, during which it was principally associated with stromal cell populations. These cells were localized initially surrounding spiral arteries and subsequently also in the subluminal epithelial region of the endometrium. These results suggest that alpha 1-PEG synthesis is principally associated with the process of stromal cell differentiation. i.e. predecidualization. However, the presence of alpha 1-PEG was not directly correlated with the presence of mature predecidual cells, suggesting that its synthesis is not an inherent feature of this cell.\r"

Anomalous findings included: 1) wide variations of urinary steroid excretion during a 4-day dexamethasone suppression test, 2) a rise of the serum cortisol after the single dose (8 mg) overnight dexamethasone suppression test, 3) a diminished serum 11-deoxycortisol response to the metyrapone test, and 4) an absent plasma ACTH response to CRH. While the results of these studies were most consistent with an ectopic source of ACTH production, magnetic resonance imaging suggested that Cushing's syndrome was due to a pituitary adenoma. The adenoma was removed by transphenoidal surgery. However, serum and urinary steroid levels remained measurable for 2 weeks because of the perioperative use of im cortisone acetate. Subsequent im administration of 200 mg cortisone acetate again led to prolonged serum and urinary steroid responses to this compound, thus emphasizing the pitfalls that may accompany the perioperative use of cortisone acetate. This patient demonstrates the importance of performing multiple tests, including magnetic resonance image scanning, in evaluation Cushing's syndrome, since standard biochemical testing may not indicate pituitary ACTH hypersecretion as the cause.\r"

While it is not possible to draw conclusions about hormone production and disposal rates from changes in serum levels, these data are most consistent with enhanced extrathyroidal (including intrapituitary) conversion of T4 to T3 and a compensatory decrease in TSH secretion.\r"

However, many studies have failed to demonstrate hyperphosphatemia or low 1,25-(OH)2D levels in patients with mild renal failure. We measured creatinine clearance (CCr), fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEP), and serum phosphorus, ionized calcium, and plasma N-terminal PTH, and 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations in 21 normal subjects and 51 patients with renal failure. Patients with mild renal failure (Ccr, greater than 40 mL/min.1.73 m2) had normal mean serum phosphorus and ionized calcium and decreased mean 1,25-(OH)2D levels compared with those in normal subjects. In patients with moderate renal failure (CCr, 20-40), the mean ionized calcium level was normal, plasma PTH levels and FEP were elevated, and the decrement in 1,25-(OH)2D was more pronounced. The mean ionized calcium level was decreased only in the group of patients with severe renal failure (CCr, less than 20). The 1,25-(OH)2D values correlated positively with CCr and negatively with the log of plasma PTH and serum phosphorus concentrations. Log of plasma PTH correlated negatively with CCr and positively with FEP. The ionized calcium concentration correlated very weakly with CCr and the log of the plasma PTH level. These data demonstrate the presence of hyperparathyroidism, normocalcemia, and 1,25-(OH)2D deficiency in renal failure and are consistent with a role for 1,25-(OH)2D in the suppression of parathyroid activity through as yet unidentified mechanisms.\r"

During whole cell incubations for 60 min at 37 C for type II EBS quantification, we found that PBMC contain 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta HSD) activity, which led to errors in estimating type II EBS concentrations by diminishing, by about 70%, the amount of available labeled E2. On the other hand, after 150 min at 4 C only 16% of the tracer was converted to estrone. Thus, we measured the maximal steady state binding in PBMC by incubating the cells with [3H]E2 at 4 C for 150 min. Equilibrium binding analysis of PBMC yielded sigmoid saturation curves with a saturation point at a ligand concentration of about 40 nmol/L. Scatchard analysis of binding data yielded a concave plot, which together with a Hill coefficient of 2.13, suggests that the type II EBS may have multiple binding sites which display positive cooperativity. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), determined from the [3H]E2 concentration required for half-saturation, was about 22 nmol/L. The type II EBS were estrogen specific, as demonstrated by competition experiments. Only those steroids with estrogenic activity inhibited binding of [3H]E2; nonestrogenic steroids did not. The type II EBS were found to be 3S macromolecules based on analysis of postlabeled fractions prepared by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The number of type II EBS in PBMC from normal women was highest during the late follicular-early luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. We conclude that human PBMC specifically take up, retain, and metabolize E2.\r"

Use of the microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method revealed that some of the monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted strongly with human thyroglobulin (Tg). Conversely, monoclonal anti-Tg antibodies cross-reacted with TPO, albeit to a lesser degree. Some anti-Tg autoantibodies in serum from patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis purified by Tg affinity chromatography bound TPO, and such binding was completely inhibited by Tg. Western blotting experiments revealed that thyroid microsomal 103K proteins recognized by mouse monoclonal and polyclonal anti-TPO antibodies were recognized by some monoclonal anti-Tg antibodies and anti-Tg autoantibodies, and conversely, that 19S Tg was recognized by some monoclonal anti-TPO antibodies. TPO was immunoprecipitated by anti-Tg autoantibodies isolated by Tg affinity chromatography. On the other hand, the specificity for TPO of the anti-Tg autoantibodies was not identical with that of anti-TPO autoantibodies. These cross-reactivities were not due to contamination of TPO with Tg or vice versa, or to contamination of the anti-Tg autoantibody preparations with anti-TPO autoantibodies. Taken together, these data indicate that Tg and TPO share common antigenic determinants and that some of those determinants are recognized by autoantibodies in the serum of patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis.\r"

  ".W": "The fetal zone (FZ) of the human fetal adrenal gland undergoes rapid growth and exhibits a high rate of steroidogenesis throughout fetal life. In addition to cAMP-dependent processes regulating steroidogenesis and possibly growth of the FZ, evidence is accumulating that cAMP-independent mechanisms are also involved. The purpose of this study was to determine if the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent stimulator of protein kinase-C activity, stimulates steroidogenesis in FZ cells and to characterize protein kinase-C activity in FZ, neocortex zone, and anencephalic adrenal tissues. Adrenal glands were obtained from first and second trimester abortions and two anencephalic fetuses. The FZ was dissected from the neocortex. In some experiments, dispersed FZ cells were incubated in the presence and absence of ACTH and TPA for 3 h. TPA and ACTH stimulated steroidogenesis 2- and 5-fold, respectively. In other experiments, the separated zones and anencephalic adrenal tissues were homogenized, and the homogenates were subjected to DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. A single peak with phospholipid- and calcium-dependent activity was found. Subcellular distribution studies demonstrated greatest activity in the cytosolic fraction. The specific activity of protein kinase-C was significantly greater in FZ than neocortex zone, whether expressed per mg protein or per microgram DNA content. The activity in anencephalic tissue was low. In addition, protein kinase-C (80,000-dalton molecular size protein) was detected in adrenal tissues after electrophoresis and immunoblotting using an antibody directed against protein kinase-C. Greater amounts of protein kinase-C were detected in FZ tissue than in NC or anencephalic adrenal tissue. These results indicate that the lower activities of protein kinase-C in neocortex and anencephalic adrenal tissues were due to low amounts of enzyme rather than inactive enzyme. In summary, TPA-stimulated steroidogenesis in fetal zone cells and fetal zone cells contained greater activity and a greater amount of protein kinase-C than neocortex cells. Minimal activity and enzyme protein were found in anencephalic tissues. These results suggest that cAMP-independent mechanisms may play a role in fetal adrenal steroidogenesis.\r"

Plasma testosterone (T) was measured hourly. In the prepubertal boys plasma LH was not detectable during the daytime but at night 20- to 300-min periods of detectable, but low (less than 0.5 IU/L) plasma LH values occurred. A discrete episodic LH pattern was discernible, and the median number of pulses was 2 during the 6-h nocturnal sampling periods. Plasma T was not detectable (less than 1.0 nmol/L). In the pubertal boys most daytime plasma LH values were greater than 0.3 IU/L, with periods of values of 0.1-0.3 IU/L and short periods of undetectable levels as well. At night definite pulses, up to 4.7 IU/L, were found in all boys. The median number of pulses was 4 during the 6-h nocturnal sampling period. Plasma T was detectable at night in 5 of these 11 boys. The results strongly suggest that at the onset of puberty prepubertal boys (G1) have no LH secretion during the day but intermittent gonadotrophic activity during the night. In early puberty LH secretion increases in amplitude as well as frequency to a clear pulsatile pattern during the night, sometimes with pulses during the day as well.\r"

The patients were followed at least monthly for 8 months. Serum Al levels were measured, and transiliac bone biopsies, double labeled with tetracycline, were obtained at both the beginning and end of the 8-month treatment period. Serum calcium and ionized calcium concentrations increased in the treatment group, and the calcitriol dosage had to be reduced in 8 patients at least once because of hypercalcemia. Calcitriol treatment did not significantly influence either serum A1 levels or the presence of stainable Al in bone. Serum PTH, urinary cAMP excretion, and bone resorption indices decreased in the treatment group, indicating suppression of parathyroid hyperfunction. Throughout the study renal function decreased at a similar rate in both groups, suggesting that calcitriol treatment had no depressive effect on renal function. We conclude that a low dose of calcitriol may be used to preserve or even restore bone metabolism in patients with predialysis chronic renal failure if serum calcium is closely followed and hypercalcemia promptly treated.\r"

We measured the urinary cAMP and phosphaturic responses to infusion of PTH-(1-34) [3U/kg BW (200 U maximum), iv in 10 min] in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism and idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, as well as normal subjects. The protocol used data from 5 30-min urine collections and 4 blood samples. Based on the results in 7 patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism (hypocalcemia with increased serum immunoreactive PTH concentrations), 2 patients with suspected pseudohypoparathyroidism, 9 patients with surgical hypoparathyroidism, and 10 normal subjects, this testing protocol differentiated well among these conditions. The patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism had blunted cAMP and phosphaturic responses to PTH-(1-34) administration compared to those of either normal or hypoparathyroid subjects. Induced hypercalcemia failed to restore a normal cAMP response to PTH-(1-34) infusion in 2 patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism. Calculation of the cAMP response to PTH-(1-34) as nanomoles per dL glomerular filtrate during the first 30 min after infusion provided better differentiation among groups than other parameters of cAMP metabolism. Calculating the phosphaturic response as the percent fall in tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption during the first hour after infusion gave the best degree of statistical separation among groups. We conclude that this new diagnostic agent is effective for the study of renal responsiveness to PTH, and that the protocol described here reliably differentiates patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism from those with hypocalcemia due to other causes.\r"

  ".W": "Altered 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) metabolism and stromal-epithelial cell interactions are two factors hypothesized to explain the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Furthermore, the development of BPH is clearly age dependent. Therefore, we studied the age-dependent alteration of 5 alpha-reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of testosterone to DHT in epithelium and stroma of the human prostate. For this purpose kinetic parameters [Km Vmax] of 5 alpha-reductase were determined separately in epithelium and stroma of normal prostatic tissue (NPR) from 5 and BPH tissue from 20 men, and the results were correlated with the age of the donors (15-86 yr). The mean Km in epithelium [NPR, 14.3 +/- 1.8 (+/- SE); BPH, 29.5 +/- 2.7 nmol/L] was significantly (P less than 0.0001) lower than that in stroma (NPR, 78.4 +/- 8.5; BPH, 185.8 +/- 13.6 nmol/L). The mean Vmax in epithelium [NPR, 23.8 +/- 3.9 (+/- SE); BPH, 27.9 +/- 3.0 pmol/mg protein.h] was significantly (P less than 0.0001) lower than that in stroma (NPR, 68.3 +/- 4.4; BPH, 173.8 +/- 12.2 pmol/mg protein.h). The DHT-forming index (Vmax/Km) in NPR epithelium [1.6 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE)] was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than that in NPR stroma (0.9 +/- 0.1), while in BPH the DHT-forming index was nearly identical in epithelium (1.1 +/- 0.1) and stroma (1.0 +/- 0.1). The Km values in epithelium and stroma both correlated positively (P less than 0.01) with age, but the Vmax values correlated positively with age (P less than 0.0001) only in stroma. The DHT-forming index decreased significantly with age in epithelium (P less than 0.01), but remained constant in stroma. These results indicate that there is a nonuniform age-dependent alteration of Km and Vmax in epithelium and stroma of the human prostate independent of the presence of BPH, which might have an impact on the conversion rate of testosterone to DHT with advancing age.\r"

Precursor circulating androgens are converted in peripheral tissue to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is ultimately metabolized to 3 alpha-Adiol-G and secreted from the cell. Elevated serum 3 alpha-Adiol-G concentrations have been reported in women in hyperandrogenic states. We studied 44 consecutive male medical students for chest hair density, acne, and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), total testosterone (total T), free and albumin-bound (bioavailable) T (bio T), and 3 alpha-Adiol-G concentrations. Although there was considerable overlap of serum 3 alpha-Adiol-G values among the groups defined by hair density or acne scores, we found statistically significant correlations between serum 3 alpha-Adiol-G and chest hairiness (P = 0.0034), acne (P = 0.0005), and a combined chest hairiness and acne score (P = 0.0018). There was no significant correlation between these clinical parameters and the levels of precursor androgens. There was, however, a strong correlation between serum 3 alpha-Adiol-G and bio T (P = 0.0005), suggesting that in men serum 3 alpha-Adiol-G levels may be dependent upon available free and albumin-bound T. The correlations in men of serum 3 alpha-Adiol-G with chest hair density, acne, and the hairiness and acne index supports the hypothesis that the serum levels of 3 alpha-Adiol-G reflect the extent of androgen action in peripheral tissues.\r"

Engl. J. Med. 291:1093-1099). Polymerized actin (F-actin) content of fixed and permeabilized intact neutrophils from the father, mother, and sister of the NAD index case have been measured using nitrobenzoxadiazole-phallacidin, a fluorescent compound which binds specifically to actin filaments. F-actin content of unstimulated PMN from all three family members was significantly lower than unstimulated control PMN (mean 23.6 +/- 0.4 SEM fluorescent units vs. 32.6 +/- 0.6 for controls). After stimulation with the chemotactic peptide FMLP, maximal F-actin content of NAD family member PMN was below that of controls (52.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 72.6 +/- 1.8). F-actin content of detergent insoluble cytoskeletons after stimulation with FMLP was also significantly lower in PMN from NAD family members as compared with controls (21 +/- 6% vs. 73 +/- 8%). PMN extracts from the father and mother, when treated with 0.6 M KCl, polymerized half as much actin as controls. Whereas diisopropylfluorophosphate treatment of normal PMN decreased actin polymerizability in cell extracts, this treatment increased the assembly of actin in parental PMN extract. Addition of purified actin to NAD extracts failed to reveal an abnormal actin polymerization inhibitory activity, and no obvious structural defect in actin purified from the father's PMNs was noted by HPLC and two dimensional thin layer chromatography of tryptic digests. The present studies of actin assembly in intact PMNs confirm that NAD is associated with a true defect in PMN actin assembly and is a genetic disorder that is recessively inherited.\r"

The changes consisted of either novel fingerprint bands, losses of bands, or both. The probe 33.15 yielded the highest rate of abnormal DNA fingerprints (21/44 carcinomas). Sequential use of the probes increased the number of cases where clonal fingerprint markers could be detected. One out of five colorectal adenomas also showed a clonal loss of a fingerprint band. In two cases of gastric cancer, DNA from the metastatic tumor had a different DNA fingerprint from that found in the primary carcinoma. DNA fingerprinting offers a novel approach to determining clonality in tumors and may prove useful for the study of tumor progression.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if acute stress activates pancreatic noradrenergic nerves, pancreatic norepinephrine (NE) output (spillover) was measured in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Central neuroglucopenia, induced by intravenous 2-deoxy-D-glucose [( 2-DG] 600 mg/kg + 13.5 mg/kg-1 per min-1) increased pancreatic NE output from a baseline of 380 +/- 100 to 1,490 +/- 340 pg/min (delta = +1,110 +/- 290 pg/min, P less than 0.01). Surgical denervation of the pancreas reduced this response by 90% (delta = +120 +/- 50 pg/min, P less than 0.01 vs. intact innervation), suggesting that 2-DG activated pancreatic nerves by increasing the central sympathetic outflow to the pancreas rather than by acting directly on nerves within the pancreas itself. These experiments provide the first direct evidence of stress-induced activation of pancreatic noradrenergic nerves in vivo. In contrast, neither hemorrhagic hypotension (50 mmHg) nor hypoxia (6-8% O2) increased pancreatic NE output (delta = +80 +/- 110 and -20 +/- 60 pg/min, respectively, P less than 0.01 vs. neuroglucopenia) despite both producing increases of arterial plasma NE and epinephrine similar to glucopenia. The activation of pancreatic noradrenergic nerves is thus stress specific. Furthermore, because both glucopenia and hypotension increased arterial NE, yet only glucopenia activated pancreatic nerves, it is suggested that a regionally selective pattern of sympathetic activation can be elicited by acute stress, a condition in which sympathetic activation has traditionally been thought to be generalized and nondiscrete.\r"

IGFs also synergize the independent mitogenic effects of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) and other agents that increase intracellular AMP concentration. We examined whether FRTL5 cells and M12 cells, a TSH-independent mutant cell line derived therefrom, secrete IGF that regulates the growth of rat thyroid follicular cells. Immunoreactive IGF-II, but not IGF-I, was found in media conditioned by FRTL5 cells; media from M12 cells contained four- to fivefold higher concentrations. Medium conditioned by FRTL5 and M12 both stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in FRTL5 and amplified the mitogenic effects of TSH. M12-conditioned medium was more potent than FRTL5-conditioned medium. Sm-1.2, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes IGF-I and IGF-II but not insulin, inhibited basal DNA synthesis in FRTL5 and M12 cells and the mitogenic effects in FRTL5 of agents that are synergized by IGF, such as TSH, forskolin, Bt2cAMP, and Graves'-IgG. Sm-1.2 did not inhibit the mitogenic response to insulin. Thus, rat insulin-like growth factor II (rIGF-II) is an autocrine growth factor that regulates FRTL5 growth, in part by amplifying the mitogenic response to TSH. Results with M12 cells raise the possibility that endogenous rIGF-II may partially mediate the TSH-independent growth of these cells.\r"

Long-chain dicarboxylic acids have profound effects on the function and structure of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that they could contribute to the mitochondrial dysfunction in Reye's syndrome. Binding of fatty acids to albumin and the intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins is important in regulating the transport and metabolism of fatty acids and protects against the toxic effects of unbound fatty acids. We studied the binding of dicarboxylic acids to defatted albumin using equilibrium dialysis to assess to what extent dicarboxylic acids are likely to be bound in the plasma of patients. Dicarboxylic acids bind weakly to albumin in a molar ratio of 3.8, 4.2, 1.6, 0.8, and 0.7 to 1 for octadecanedioic, hexadecanedioic, tetradecanedioic, dodecanedioic, and decanedioic acid, respectively. The dissociation constants for long-chain dicarboxylic acids are 100-1,000-fold larger than those of comparable monocarboxylic acids. Oleate competes with dicarboxylic acid and reduces the moles of dicarboxylic acid bound per mol of albumin to less than 1. Octanoate inhibits dicarboxylic acid binding. Our observations indicate that in Reye's syndrome, substantial concentrations of dicarboxylic acids of patients may be free and potentially toxic to mitochondria and other cellular processes.\r"

Pain intensity was quantified using a visual-analogue scale. To eliminate the release of endogenous opioids produced by the placebo component of open drug administration, all injections were made by a preprogrammed infusion pump. The analgesia produced by pentazocine, an agonist-antagonist opiate-analgesic acting predominantly at the kappa opiate receptor, was potentiated by low-dose naloxone, whereas the analgesia produced by morphine, a mu-agonist, was attenuated by low-dose naloxone. To evaluate whether similar potentiation would be present in an animal model, and specifically, in the absence of diazepam, which patients receive, we performed an analogous experiment in rats in which nociceptive threshold was determined using the Randall-Selitto paw-withdrawal test. The results were completely analogous to the clinical results: pentazocine analgesia was potentiated by low-dose naloxone, whereas morphine analgesia was attenuated by low-dose naloxone. These data demonstrate a novel interaction between opiates, and suggest a rationale for opiate combinations to produce potent analgesia with fewer autonomic side effects and less abuse potential than presently available analgesics.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of DPI, a new inotropic agent, were compared in trabeculae carneae from control and myopathic human hearts loaded with aequorin, a bioluminescent calcium indicator that emits light when it combines with calcium, and in saponin-skinned trabeculae carneae from the same hearts. The force-pCa curves in saponin-skinned fibers and the peak force-peak Ca2+ curves in aequorin-loaded preparations were not significantly different between the control and myopathic tissues. The force-pCa curve in the skinned and aequorin-loaded preparations from the same control hearts displayed no significant shifts with the addition of DPI. In contrast, a leftward shift was present in the force-calcium relationship in the presence of DPI in aequorin-loaded and skinned muscles from myopathic hearts, indicating an increase in the sensitivity of the myofilaments to calcium. These differences in the modulation of calcium activation between myopathic and control tissues indicate that pharmacological agents may produce differential effects in normal and diseased hearts.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive urine calcium excretion in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria may involve a primary increase in intestinal calcium absorption, overproduction of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or a defect in renal tubular calcium reabsorption. To determine the mechanism of hypercalciuria in an animal model, hypercalciuria was selected for in rats and the most hypercalciuric animals inbred. Animals from the fourth generation were utilized to study mineral balance and intestinal transport in relation to levels of serum 1,25(OH)2D3. Both urine calcium excretion and net intestinal calcium absorption were greater in hypercalciuric males (HM) than in normocalciuric males (NM) and in hypercalciuric females (HF) than in normocalciuric females (NF). However, serum 1,25(OH)2D3 was lower in HM than in NM and not different in HF than in NF. Net calcium balance was more positive in HM than in NM and in HF than in NF. In vitro duodenal calcium net flux was correlated with serum 1,25(OH)2D3 in HM and HF and in NM and NF. However, with increasing serum 1,25(OH)2D3 there was greater calcium net flux in hypercalciuric rats than in normocalciuric controls. Hypercalciuria in this colony of hypercalciuric rats is due to a primary intestinal overabsorption of dietary calcium and not an overproduction of 1,25(OH)2D3 or a defect in the renal tubular reabsorption of calcium.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed to investigate the mechanism of action of DPI 201-106 on human heart muscle. In both control and myopathic muscles, DPI produced concentration-dependent increases in action potential duration, resting muscle tension, peak isometric tension, and duration of isometric tension. These changes were associated with increases in resting intracellular calcium and peak calcium transients as measured by aequorin. At higher concentrations of DPI, a second delayed Ca2+ transient (L') appeared. L' was inhibited by tetrodotoxin and ryanodine, suggesting that DPI acts at both the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. DPI toxicity was manifested by after-glimmers and after-contractions reflecting a Ca2+-overload state: DPI effects were mimicked by veratridine, a Na+ channel agonist, and reversed by tetrodotoxin, yohimbine, and cadmium, Na+ channel antagonists. These results suggest that DPI acts primarily as a Na+ channel agonist. DPI may produce an increase in intracellular Ca2+ by increasing intracellular Na+ and altering Na+-Ca2+ exchange across the sarcolemma. DPI may also increase intracellular Ca2+ by directly altering sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling.\r"

  ".W": "Single nephron filtration rate of albumin (SNGFRAlb) was measured in remnant nephrons of Munich-Wistar rats 4-6 wk after subtotal nephrectomy (NPX). Serial thin-section histological analysis was then conducted on the same glomeruli by light microscopy. SNGFRAlb ranged from 1 to 15 times normal. However, a direct relationship between abnormalities of structure and function was not seen, e.g. the glomeruli with the fewest structural abnormalities and marked hyperfiltration often had the highest SNGFRAlb. Moreover, the majority of glomeruli had minimal structural abnormalities. Normalization of the markedly elevated glomerular capillary pressure (PGC) in these glomeruli was accomplished by acute intravenous infusion of verapamil, which decreased SNGFRAlb by 9-83% without affecting the single nephron filtration rate of water (SNGFRH2O). 1-2 wk after subtotal NPX, all glomeruli were hyperfiltering and had elevated PGC. The fractional clearance of larger (greater than 36 A) dextrans was selectively increased in these glomeruli that lacked discernible damage by light microscopy. Verapamil normalized PGC, reduced proteinuria to 48 +/- 4% of baseline, and improved glomerular size selectivity without altering SNGFRH2O. Proteinuria after subtotal NPX thus originates largely from glomeruli with minimal structural abnormalities. The defect in size selectivity is largely attributed to the prevailing high PGC, producing large, nonselective channels on the glomerular capillary wall. The observations raise the possibility that in chronic renal diseases, the reduction in proteinuria often seen after therapeutic measures, including antihypertensive medication, may reflect their functional effect on the relatively intact glomeruli rather than their structure-sparing effect on severely damaged glomeruli, which contribute little to the proteinuria.\r"

A model of selective aldosterone deficiency (SAD) with hyperkalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis was employed to assess segmental acidification by measuring in situ pH, titratable acidity (TA) and total ammonia (Am). Hydrogen ion secretion was also examined as a function of the increment in in situ PCO2 in the collecting duct during bicarbonate loading. SAD rats were compared to ADX controls that received adrenalectomy and chronic replacement of gluco- and mineralocorticoid and to rats with chronic metabolic acidosis induced by oral NH4Cl (CMA). Both fractional and absolute delivery of Am to the loop of Henle was lower in SAD vs. CMA rats (1.34 to 3.63 mM, P less than 0.01). Delivery of Am to the base and tip collecting duct (BCD and TCD) was also markedly lower in SAD (1.50 vs. 0.52 and 1.77 vs. 0.47 mM, respectively, P less than 0.01). Net addition of Am and net acid between BCD and TCD, observed in CMA rats, was not observed in SAD despite equivalent degrees of systemic metabolic acidosis. Similarly, the concentration gradient favoring transfer of NH3 between loop of Henle and CD was reduced in SAD. During bicarbonate loading the increment in PCO2 at BCD, TCD and in final urine was significantly lower in SAD rats than in adrenal intact bicarbonate-loaded rats. Therefore, the acidification defect in this model of SAD appears to be a result of a decrease in ammonia production and delivery to the loop of Henle, impaired transfer from loop to collecting duct and reduction in the rate of H+ secretion by the collecting duct.\r"

  ".U": "89034858\r", 
  ".W": "Murine P388D1 macrophages have a receptor pathway that binds human hypertriglyceridemic very low density lipoproteins (HTG-VLDL) that is fundamentally distinct from the LDL receptor pathway. Trypsin-treated HTG-VLDL (tryp-VLDL), devoid of apolipoprotein (apo)-E, fail to bind to the LDL receptor, yet tryp-VLDL and HTG-VLDL cross-compete for binding to P388D1 macrophage receptors, indicating that these lipoproteins bind to the same sites. The specific, high affinity binding of tryp-VLDL and HTG-VLDL to macrophages at 4 degrees C is equivalent and at 37 degrees C both produce rapid, massive, curvilinear (receptor-mediated) triglyceride accumulation in macrophages. Ligand blots show that P388D1 macrophages express a membrane protein of approximately 190 kD (MBP190) that binds both tryp-VLDL and HTG-VLDL; this binding is competed by HTG-VLDL, trypsinized HTG-VLDL, and trypsinized normal VLDL but not by normal VLDL or LDL. The macrophage LDL receptor (approximately 130 kD) and cellular uptake of beta-VLDL, but not MBP 190 nor uptake of tryp-VLDL, are induced when cells are exposed to lipoprotein-deficient medium and decreased when cells are cholesterol loaded. Unlike the macrophage LDL receptor, MBP 190 partitions into the aqueous phase after phase separation of Triton X-114 extracts. An anti-LDL receptor polyclonal antibody blocks binding of HTG-VLDL to the LDL receptor and blocks receptor-mediated uptake of beta-VLDL by P388D1 cells but fails to inhibit specific cellular uptake of tryp-VLDL or to block binding of tryp-VLDL to MBP 190. Human monocytes, but not human fibroblasts, also express a binding protein for HTG-VLDL and tryp-VLDL similar to MBP 190. We conclude that macrophages possess receptors for abnormal human triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are distinct from LDL receptors in ligand specificity, regulation, immunological characteristics, and cellular distribution. MBP 190 shares these properties and is a likely receptor candidate for the high affinity uptake of TG-rich lipoproteins by macrophages.\r"

To assess whether this phenomenon occurs in the presence of depressed LV function, the effects of pacing on LV pressure and volume were compared in seven patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (LV ejection fraction 0.19 +/- 0.11) and six patients with no or minimal coronary artery disease (LV ejection fraction 0.69 +/- 0.11). Patients with normal LV function demonstrated significant increases in LV peak-positive dP/dt, LV end-systolic pressure-volume ratio, LV peak filling rate, and a progressive leftward and downward shift of their pressure-volume diagrams, compatible with increased contractility and distensibility in response to pacing tachycardia. There was no change in LV peak-negative dP/dt or tau. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, in contrast, demonstrated no increase in either LV peak-positive dP/dt or the end-systolic pressure-volume ratio, and absence of a progressive leftward shift of their pressure-volume diagrams. Moreover, cardiomyopathy patients demonstrated no increase in LV peak-negative dP/dt or LV peak filling rate and a blunted downward shift of the diastolic limb of their pressure-volume diagrams. Tau, as determined from a derivative method, became abbreviated although never reaching control values. We conclude that patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may demonstrate little or no significant enhancement in systolic and diastolic function during atrial pacing tachycardia, suggesting a depression of both inotropic and lusitropic reserve.\r"

In addition, it is the serum precursor of the major protein constituent of reactive amyloid fibrils. Sequence analyses have identified a number of polymorphic forms of human SAA and amyloid A protein (AA), but the question of the number of genes encoding SAA in the human has not been addressed. In addition, there are insufficient data to predict whether one form of SAA predisposes to amyloid fibril formation. In the present study three separate SAA proteins have been isolated from the plasma of one individual and completely sequenced. While two of the SAA forms (SAA2 alpha and SAA2 beta) differ from each other only at position 71, they differ from the most abundant form (SAA1) at seven and eight other positions, respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNAs from a liver library of this individual identified all three mRNs coding for these proteins and proved that: (a) the often-reported absence of arginine at the amino terminus of SAA proteins must result from proteolytic processing of the protein; (b) the polymorphism involving histidine and arginine at position 71 is present at the DNA level and therefore is not due to an event at the translational level; (c) there are at least two genes coding for human SAA. Comparison of these data to published sequences of SAA and AA proteins may help in identifying genetically determined forms of SAA which predispose to reactive amyloid fibril formation.\r"

Since complement proteins are synthesized in hepatic and extrahepatic sites, we studied a murine model of SLE to ascertain the relative importance of local and humoral (liver) synthesis of complement. C3, C4, and C2 mRNA increase in kidney coincident with the development of nephritis in the MRL lpr/lpr mouse, a strain that spontaneously develops SLE. Two factor B messenger RNA transcripts are expressed in kidney and intestine; SLE nephritis is associated with decrease in the long factor B mRNA and increase in the short form. Increased local synthesis of C3 and B protein and a concomitant glomerular and renal interstitial macrophage infiltrate paralleled the increase in mRNA content in the (lpr/lpr) mice. In addition to kidney, an increase in C3, C4, C2 and factor B mRNA was noted in the lung, heart and intestine and to a lesser extent in liver of (lpr/lpr) in comparison to the MRL (+/+) animals. These results suggest that in SLE local expression of complement genes plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic glomerulonephritis and in the autoimmune arteritis of other organs.\r"

The present study demonstrates that this growth activity is an insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)-type molecule. Partial purification of medium conditioned by activated alveolar macrophages using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography revealed an IGF-I molecule as detected by an anti-IGF-I polyclonal antibody and that the specific activity of the progression-type growth activity tracked with the amount of IGF-I present. In a serum-free complementation test, the increase in fibroblast proliferation by alveolar macrophage IGF-I was reduced in a dose-response manner with an anti-IGF-I monoclonal antibody. The alveolar macrophage IGF-I displaced 125I-IGF-I from its receptor in a binding assay utilizing human lung fibroblasts and it stimulated type I IGF receptors purified from human lung fibroblasts to phosphorylate a tyrosine-containing artificial substrate. In contrast to the 7.6-kD serum IGF-I, gel chromatography revealed that the alveolar macrophage IGF-I had an apparent molecular mass of 26 kD, similar to other tissue IGF-Is. Alveolar macrophages expressed IGF-I mRNA transcripts as detected by solution hybridization using a 32P-labeled riboprobe complementary to exons I-II-III of the IGF-I gene. In the context of the known functions of the family of IGF-I molecules in cell growth, IGF-I released by activated alveolar macrophages may play a role in acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.\r"

To address whether this modulates the response to TXA2 synthase inhibition in the setting of thrombosis in vivo, we examined the interaction of a TXA2 synthase inhibitor (U63,557a) and a TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist (L636,499) in a canine model of coronary thrombosis after electrically induced endothelial injury. U63,557a exerted little inhibitory effect in this model despite a marked reduction in serum TXB2 and urinary 2,3-dinor-TXB2, an index of TXA2 biosynthesis. Combination of the two drugs was more effective than either drug alone. The enhanced effect achieved upon addition of the TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist to the TXA2 synthase inhibitor suggests that the response to the latter compound was limited by the proaggregatory effects of prostaglandin endoperoxides. The increased effect of the combination over the receptor antagonist alone may reflect metabolism of PGG2/PGH2 to platelet inhibitory prostaglandins. This is supported by the following findings: (a) urinary 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha, an index of prostacyclin biosynthesis, increased after administration of the synthase inhibitor, an effect that was exaggerated in the presence of thrombosis; (b) inhibition of arachidonate-induced platelet aggregation by U63,557a was dependent on the formation of a platelet-inhibitory prostaglandin; and (c) pretreatment with aspirin abolished the synergism between these compounds. These studies demonstrate that prostaglandin endoperoxides modulate the response to TXA2 synthase inhibition in vivo and identify a drug combination of potential therapeutic efficacy in the prevention of thrombosis.\r"

The microvascular lesion was characterized by endothelial cell damage and microthrombi in the venules and capillaries of the intestinal lamina propria. Marker organisms, given orally to challenged mice, grew in the exuded fluid and could invade the mucosa. Intravenous transfer of postchallenge plasma produced the lesion in normal mice and absorption of such plasma by Sepharose coupled to LPS-antibody abolished this effect. Instillation of large quantities of LPS into the lumen of the intestine produced scattered microvascular lesions, although none of these animals developed diarrhea. Since a similar microvascular lesion has been described in the rectal mucosal lamina propria of adults with acute diarrhea, it is suggested that LPS-induced vascular damage may be a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of acute diarrhea.\r"

During phase I, PA rats exhibited overt nephrotic syndrome and impaired glomerular filtration, primarily due to a reduction in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient. The morphologic counterpart of the latter consisted of effacement of glomerular epithelial cell foot processes and decrease in the number of filtration slit diaphragms. Administration of the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril to PA rats did not ameliorate glomerular dysfunction. During phase II, PA rats exhibited spontaneous resolution of proteinuria, impaired function, and morphologic abnormalities. However, PA rats now demonstrated marked glomerular capillary hypertension and continued, albeit lesser, reductions in the ultrafiltration coefficient. Concurrent CEI administration modestly lowered systemic arterial pressure, and normalized the glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure and ultrafiltration coefficient. Additional rats were studied during phase III, 70 wk after injection. In PA rats, prior glomerular hypertension was associated with development of recurrent proteinuria and extensive glomerular sclerosis, whereas concurrent CEI administration limited these parameters to values comparable to those in sham rats. Glomerular hypertension thus may explain the development of glomerular sclerosis and renal failure long after an episode of acute glomerular injury.\r"

In children and adults, the lipolytic effect of TSH gradually decreased further and was present only in unphysiological concentrations. The catecholamine-induced lipolysis was pronounced and was similar in children and adults (350% over basal). TSH is the dominating lipolytic hormone in vitro during the neonatal period. Thus, the peak elevation of circulating TSH, which is seen immediately after birth, may be essential to lipolysis during this part of life.\r"

In the present study, we tested the effects of neutralizing antisera to the PTHrP on serum calcium and urine cAMP in two animal models of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia. The animal models consisted of (a) a human squamous cell lung cancer and (b) a human laryngeal cancer, both serially carried in athymic mice. The antisera specifically reduced the elevated serum calcium and urinary cAMP levels in the tumor-bearing animals. We conclude that PTHrP plays a major role in the pathogenesis of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia.\r"

In each of these families, the two affected children have inherited different apo B alleles from at least one parent, whereas the siblings would be anticipated to share common alleles if this disorder were due to an apo B gene mutation. This linkage study shows that in these families, the apo B gene is discordant with ABL and therefore the disorder is caused by a defect in another gene, which is important for the normal synthesis or secretion of apo B-containing lipoproteins from both the liver and intestine.\r"

Therefore we undertook immunophenotyping of melanophages in selected inflammatory mucocutaneous lesions to determine whether the OKM5+, OKM1- phenotype was limited to ultraviolet-induced inflammation or whether the occurrence of melanophages expressing this antigen-presenting cell phenotype was a more generalized phenomenon. Ten of the eleven patients with chronic inflammatory skin lesions demonstrated melanophages expressing the OKM5+, OKM1-, T6-, DR+ immunophenotype. In addition, they often expressed Mo3e, a marker of activated macrophages. In contrast, melanophages of a patient with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, although DR+, failed to express OKM5. These results are taken to support an active role for OKM5+, OKM1-, T6-, DR+ melanophages in inflammatory skin disease because these cells demonstrate the phenotype of activated inflammation-producing monocytes and potent antigen-presenting cells.\r"

The identification of this syndrome may be important prognostically in patients with diseases or conditions in which collagen plays a major role, such as joint disease (dislocations), bruising disease (pigmented purpura), and potentially scarring diseases (acne, patients undergoing cutaneous surgery).\r"

The median time to relapse was 44.5 months. Sixty-eight patients (58.1%) developed a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, but only one patient had to discontinue therapy as a consequence. No appreciable differences were seen in the probability to achieve complete remission or time to complete remission as stratified by gender, substage, or the development of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Survival analysis revealed that the probability of surviving at 5 years was 89% for all patients.

Congenital features were found in seven biopsy specimens from the indubitably acquired melanocytic nevi. These nevi were larger and more speckled in color than melanocytic nevi without \"congenital features.\" It is concluded that the histologic features said to be specific for congenital nevi are, in fact, not specific. The possible relationship between these features and an increased melanoma risk cannot be refuted by the present study, but the risk of misinterpretation based on congenital features as the sole criterion in the prediction of the potential malignancy of melanocytic nevi is real.\r"

Why they have not been previously described is a mystery, but it is more understandable when the difficulty of dissection is noted. Freeing the disk while investigating the retrodiskal area, and then performing fiber-by-fiber dissection of the deep masseter muscle are uncommon procedures. Muscle fibers often exist from the deep masseter muscle to the capsule of the TMJ, and these muscles could easily be mistaken for the fibers already known and, therefore, ignored when the masseter was removed in dissection. If the first specimen dissected had not been a well-developed male with strong tendon attachment, the attachments would have been missed in this case as well.\r"

Frequency of glove use was related to hepatitis B infection (P less than .01), with dentists who never wore gloves being infected more than twice as often as dentists who wore gloves routinely. Dentists with less frequent glove use and more years in practice had a higher incidence of hepatitis B infection (P less than .0001).\r"

Orthodontic attempts to correct malocclusion or other disharmonies of the dentition in affected individuals without surgical intervention can cause tooth instability and result in less than satisfactory cosmetic results.

Beauty is both enjoyable (subjective and cosmetic), and admirable (objective and definable). Ethics is a branch of philosophy dealing with morality. Morality relates humans to one another in a responsible way using rationality. Dentists assume unique moral duties in presenting themselves to society as being uniquely qualified to care for their oral health. Three principles of ethics relate directly to professional duties in esthetic dentistry: beneficence, autonomy, and justice. These principles have moral force in committing dentists to gain informed consent and to execute therapy in keeping with professional standards of care. Practical application of issues deriving from esthetics and ethics suggests that dentists must be sensitive to esthetics in their diagnosis and treatment planning and that a structured, formal consultation with a patient must be conducted to educate the patient regarding the goals of treatment, alternative therapies, prognosis, and costs. Only through such an effort can dentists gain informed consent. The goal of esthetic dentistry is the achievement of admirable (objective) and enjoyable (subjective) beauty, which is possible only through patient participation in decision making and excellence in technical performance.\r"

  ".W": "The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) was initiated to contribute to the prevention of illness and death from coronary heart disease by reducing the prevalence of high blood cholesterol. The report of an expert panel of this program provides guidelines for the treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults 20 years of age and over. Dietary therapy is the primary treatment. The goal of the recommended dietary therapy is to lower the LDL-cholesterol concentration, although measurement of total blood cholesterol can be used to monitor the response to diet. Dietary modification involves a progressive decrease in intake of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. The Step-One Diet calls for an intake of total fat less than 30% of calories, saturated fatty acids less than 10% of calories, and cholesterol less than 300 mg/day. If the desired decrease in LDL-cholesterol is not achieved with that dietary change, then the Step-Two Diet is begun. It requires a reduction in saturated fatty acids to less than 7% of calories and cholesterol to less than 200 mg/day. This article provides background information on the organization and objectives of the NCEP and focuses on the recommendations of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP), e.g., classification of risk for developing coronary heart disease based on total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels and recommendations for treatment of patients with high blood cholesterol. The emphasis of the discussion is on dietary treatment. The implications of the recommendations for the dietetic practitioner are discussed. These include an expanded leadership role to meet the education needs of health professionals and patients.\r"

This study was done to determine the feasibility of developing a program that incorporated modified menus and nutrition information and that was based upon selections from existing menus. The modified menus planned for each day of the 5-week cycle provided approximately 1,200 kcal, 30% energy from fat, 250 mg cholesterol, and 3 gm sodium, as compared with 2,600 kcal, 35% energy from fat, 400 mg cholesterol, and 6 gm sodium in the original foodservice menus. Student response to the programs was assessed. Of the 97 students who responded, 35% reported regularly referring to information on the menus and displays, and 18% stated that they had followed the menus. Of the latter group, five (30%) attributed a weight loss to use of the program. Women were much more likely to use the program than were men. The prevalence of women who wanted to lose weight did not differ between those who were greater than 10% above desirable weight and those who were not. Three-fourths of the students wanted the program to continue. A nutrition program such as the one described might encourage students to eat in university foodservices.\r"

Dietitians, nurse practitioners, and pediatricians were surveyed to determine what dietary recommendations they give to parents and what source of information most influenced their decisions. A fourth group, pediatricians with particular expertise in nutrition, were surveyed as well. The overall response rate was 76%, with a total usable sample of 252. In all professional groups, 54% had no preference for any one commercially prepared formula. More importance was given to sodium content than to fat composition of formulas. On the choice of whole, low-fat, or non-fat milk for both 1- and 6-year-old children, professional groups differed significantly. Dietitians and the subgroup of pediatricians with nutrition expertise were more likely to recommend milk with higher fat content than other professional groups. Recommendations for both sodium- and fat-modified diets for children depended on CVD risk, and opinions varied between groups. Pediatricians and nurse practitioners were more likely to recommend dietary modifications for children with higher CVD risk. The variation in dietary recommendations within and between professional groups strongly indicates the need for research on the safety and efficacy of dietary restrictions in childhood.\r"

Dietary adherence was found to be independent for sex, age, occupation, marital status, ethnicity, and education. However, comparison of the groups' health and dietary perceptions showed that non-adherers, as opposed to adherers, were not concerned about reaching their ideal body weight; needed to be motivated to exercise by family or friends; did not perceive diabetes as a threat to their health; were not satisfied with their knowledge about diabetes; were not content with their nutrient status but believed they were consuming adequate amounts of carbohydrate; and believed that they did not need to change their intake of fruit, vegetables, and bread--liking/disliking of these foods being the most important barrier to dietary change. Such patients, identified in screening for potential dietary non-adherence, may benefit from the use of educational strategies different from those used with patients who are more oriented toward health.\r"

This article describes four major factors that influence learner readiness in short one-to-one interactions. The factors include information processing capacity, affective state, prior learning and experience, and the learner's \"way of knowing\" or philosophy of learning. Important aspects of the factors can be revealed quickly with 2 to 3 minutes of respectful, interested questioning to determine whether the learner is in a negative mood or oppressed affective state and to determine his or her experiential or knowledge background and approach or reaction to learning new material. The most common mistake educators make is \"information overload.\" The human capacity to process information is limited. Instruction should be made to fit the learner's capacity (i.e., a maximum of seven +/- two concepts should be addressed in a 15-minute period). When nutritionists adjust their teaching style to better fit individual variations, they will maximize their impact as educators.\r"

At present, insufficient evidence is available to conclude whether sodium in drinking water causes elevation of blood pressure. It is possible that reducing sodium intake early in life may minimize the risk of hypertension in the later years. Dietitians play a key role in the control of hypertension. Many communities in the U.S. exceed the recommended 20 mg/L or less sodium in drinking water; this may present a hazard to some members of our population.\r"

There were no differences in the density of receptors with age in the heavy membrane fraction. However, the density of receptors in the light-density fraction from lungs increased with age (109 +/- 7, 230 +/- 43, and 225 +/- 36, F(2,12) = 4.4, p less than .05). Receptors in the heavy membrane fraction expressed both high and low affinity binding for isoproterenol, whereas receptors in light-density fraction expressed only low affinity binding. In contrast to the lung, there were no changes in the number of receptors with age in the light-density membrane fraction from hearts.

  ".W": "In order to clarify the reasons for life extension due to the germ-free state and mild dietary restriction, serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, prolactin, and testosterone were determined in conventional and gnotobiotic (single microbe contaminations) Lobund-Wistar rats fed either ad libitum or restricted to 12 grams (70% of ad libitum) of diet per day from weaning. Thyroid hormone levels were slightly higher in gnotobiotic rats, declined between 7 and 30 months of age in all rats, and were not affected by dietary restriction. Prolactin showed a significant rise with age within the ad libitum rats only. Testosterone levels declined significantly with age in all rats, but were significantly higher in restricted rats at all ages. These results indicate that mild dietary restriction extends life span without reducing circulating levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, or testosterone in mature Lobund-Wistar rats, and prevents the age-associated rise in serum prolactin. Life extension in germ-free rats is not related to differences in endocrine function.\r"

Subjects were free to select foods for meals and snacks from among a variety of high protein and high carbohydrate foods; when necessary, fat was added to make the foods isocaloric. The elderly subjects consumed significantly fewer calories, carbohydrates, and fat than the young subjects, both absolutely and when adjusted for differences in body weight (p less than .001). Mealtime protein intake when adjusted for body weight was similar among males of both age groups and significantly greater than the intakes of both young and elderly females (p less than .001). However, young males consumed more protein from snacks than young females or older adults and thus exhibited the highest daily protein intakes. The two age groups differed significantly in their pattern of food intake from meals and snacks. Elderly adults consumed almost 85% of their total calories from meals, whereas the younger adults consumed about 72% (p less than .001) from meals. Both groups snacked mainly on carbohydrate-rich foods. The elderly subjects consumed significantly fewer snacks than the young; their daily average consumption was 2.2 and that of the young, 4.5 (p less than .001). The persistence of different patterns of food intake between young and elderly individuals when measured under identical clinical conditions suggests that age per se, in addition to age-associated lifestyle changes, may affect eating behavior.\r"

The purpose of the present studies was to determine whether or not beta receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) membranes showed similar age-related changes. Plasma Percoll gradients were used to isolate PMN and mononuclear leukocyte (MN) cells from blood drawn in the supine position from young (25-34 years) and elderly (60-76 years) healthy volunteers. Both blood pressures and plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly elevated in the elderly subjects. Saturation analysis with [125I]-(-) iodopindolol (IPIN) showed a 2.5-fold higher density of beta 2 receptors on the MN, but not PMN, membranes from the elderly. Neither the affinities of the receptor for IPIN or the agonist isoproterenol, nor the GTP-induced shift in agonist affinity, differed with subject age in either cell type. These results suggest that subpopulations of MN cells on which beta-adrenergic receptors are localized may increase in the elderly and that it is important to measure receptor properties on a more homogeneous leukocyte population such as PMN cells or subpopulations of MN cells as a function of aging.\r"

In the present study, evoked potentials and neuropsychological testing were obtained in healthy subjects during neuropharmacological manipulations including: scopolamine (anticholinergic), scopolamine plus physostigmine (anticholinesterase), scopolamine plus methylphenidate (adrenergic), and placebo. Scopolamine prolonged P3 latency and reduced spectral power of long latency evoked potentials without significantly altering earlier components. Physostigmine partially reversed these effects, but methylphenidate did not. Motor speed was slowed by scopolamine, but not by scopolamine plus methylphenidate. Cholinergic systems appear to be involved in generation or modulation of the P3 potential, possibly secondary to the cholinergic role in selective attention. Similar techniques may be useful as in vivo probes of central cholinergic function and thus as research and diagnostic aids in aging and disease.\r"

Twenty young (average age 30.4 yrs) and 14 elderly (average age 70.4 yrs) men underwent 10 min blood sampling for 25 hrs to evaluate the circadian periodicity of LH, LH pulse frequency, and T. Using cosinor regression analysis, young men were found to have a significant (p less than .05) circadian variation in LH pulse frequency, with slowing of LH pulses during the night (maximum slowing at 2230 hr). There was also a tendency for LH pulse amplitude to increase at night (p = .06) in young men. However, no significant circadian pattern in LH pulse frequency or amplitude was detected in the elderly men. Mean LH by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and bioassay did not vary over the 24-hr period in either age group. Both young and elderly men had significant circadian rhythms in serum T, although the rhythm in elderly men was considerably blunted and was shifted in time compared to the young. These data provide evidence for age-related changes in the circadian rhythms of LH pulse frequency and T secretion and suggest that the LHRH pulse generator loses its circadian rhythmicity with normal aging in men.\r"

Plasma testosterone concentrations and testes weights were maintained in healthy hamsters 16-19 months of age, but chronic stress decreased plasma testosterone in these old hamsters and not in younger ones (8-11 months of age). Chronic disease in the form of congestive heart failure (CHF) in cardiomyopathic hamsters also decreased plasma testosterone and testes weights, although it is not clear what aspects of this disease affected testicular function. There was an interaction between disease and stress, in that chronic stress produced lower plasma testosterone and testes weights in hamsters with heart failure than in age-matched stressed, healthy hamsters. It appears that younger hamsters can maintain reproductive function during stress, but older ones may not be able to do so. Congestive heart failure in hamsters clearly impairs normal reproductive function by itself; it also makes them more susceptible to stress, so that combining stress and disease results in almost complete suppression of plasma testosterone levels.\r"

  ".W": "The terminal drop hypothesis states that death is preceded by a decrease in cognitive functioning over an approximately five-year period prior to death (Riegel & Riegel, 1972); there is some disagreement as to whether this decrease is pervasive or restricted to specific abilities. The present study assessed the relationship between distance from death and tests of vocabulary, numerical facility, and perceptual speed for 97 subjects who had died within seven years of testing. Only vocabulary scores for those who died at age 70 or less and within two years of testing were affected by terminal drop. An additional analysis comparing the performance of the deceased subjects with a still-living sample matched for age, gender, and education produced nonsignificant results but a trend consistent with the initial analyses. Thus the terminal drop phenomenon may be limited to abilities that typically are relatively unaffected by age, such as vocabulary or other verbal abilities. Furthermore, the effects may be restricted to a time period much closer to death than had been originally proposed.\r"

Additionally, cues presented at recall were either the same as or different from those presented at encoding, resulting in four encoding cue--retrieval cue combinations: (a) strong encoding cue and (same) strong retrieval cue; (b) weak encoding cue and (same) weak retrieval cue; (c) weak encoding cue and (different) strong retrieval cue; (d) strong encoding cue and (different) weak retrieval cue. For the most part, the results revealed strong encoding specificity effects for both age groups, as both old and young participants recalled more when the same cues were presented at encoding and retrieval than when different cues were presented. However, when elderly participants received verbal cues under divided attention conditions, evidence for general encoding rather than encoding specificity occurred. Results are discussed in terms of both the encoding specificity principle as well as a more process-oriented interpretation.\r"

The present study examined the possibility that fear of aging, as a reflection of personal worries (frequently designated as \"negative affect\"), is actually an indicator rather than a determinant of subjective well-being. According to this alternative explanation, fear of aging was essentially used to predict itself. A factor analysis of Klemmack and Roff's original data supported this alternative interpretation. As predicted, fear of aging items loaded as a factor with other indicators of \"negative affect\" and, thus, should have been designated as part of the dependent variable. Furthermore, and contrary to Klemmack and Roff's treatment of subjective well-being as unidimensional, the factor analysis indicated two additional dimensions of well-being--Happiness and Plans for the Future. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of subjecting items to factor analysis and related techniques when developing and validating constructs.\r"

National data files provide source information on traffic fatalities, population, number of licensed drivers, distance of travel, and mortality from all causes. Involvement rates in severe crashes are inferred from fatality data using recently published relations linking occupant survivability to age and sex. In no case among 14 measures examined did the value at the oldest age for which data were available (varied from source to source) exceed that for young drivers. Although some risks that drivers face may increase at older ages to levels above their minimum values, the increases are small compared to the substantial reductions in distances driven with increasing age; thus, reductions in mobility may be a more dominant correlate of aging than reductions in driving safety.\r"

The potential to apply therapy through miniscopes is limited in instruments without tip deflection, suction, and automatic air and water insufflation; all features that increase both production expense and instrument size.\r"

  ".W": "We treated 19 consecutive patients with toxic megacolon complicating inflammatory bowel disease with the usual intensive medical regimen, but also added a new technique, namely, the frequent rolling of the patient to the prone position in order to redistribute colonic gas and thereby promote decompression. In all 19 patients (100%) the colon was decompressed within 1-13 days (mean 4.9 days). Two patients (10.5%) died. In long-term follow-up (mean 6.5 years), only 4 of the 17 survivors (21%) ultimately required colectomy; the remaining 13 (68%) were either completely well or only minimally symptomatic and did not require steroids. Most reports on the management of toxic megacolon stress the need for early surgical intervention, but our success in decompression with the addition of the \"rolling technique\" suggests an improvement in the nonoperative management of toxic megacolon.\r"

Breath hydrogen excretion after ingestion of rice pancakes was significantly higher in patients than in 10 controls, suggesting malabsorption of carbohydrates. Mouth-to-cecum transit time was not significantly different between the two groups. Pancreatic enzyme therapy significantly reduced both fecal fat excretion and the degree of carbohydrate malabsorption, but, in contrast, did not significantly change mouth-to-cecum transit. There was no correlation between the degree of carbohydrate or fat malabsorption and mouth-to-cecum transit time. Carbohydrate malabsorption is common in pancreatic insufficiency and is markedly improved by enzyme supplementation. Mouth-to-cecum transit, however, does not play a major role in carbohydrate or fat malabsorption in these patients.\r"

Four months later, the tumor had increased in size to 4 cm in diameter. The tumor was 5 cm in length and incarcerated into the stomach with an elongated stalk at operation. The growth curve was linear on semilogarithmic paper; its doubling time was calculated as 2.2 months. The surgical specimen showed squamous cell carcinoma and spindle cell sarcoma-like elements that comprised the greater part of the tumor. The sarcoma-like elements had metastasized to the abdominal lymph nodes. These findings confirm that this polypoid tumor grows rapidly.\r"

There is a diurnal rhythm in the proliferation of the precursor cells; more surface lining cells arise in the daytime. This results in sloughing of more cells. In the gastrointestinal mucosa, there are two modes of mucus secretion. One is a slow secretion of jelly-like visible mucus, which is produced in the gastric surface epithelial cells and in the intestinal goblet cells. It is secreted when the cells reach the surface and become sloughed off into the lumen; the secretion time is equal to their life span, on the order of 3-5 days. The other mode is a rapid but persistent secretion of invisible mucus, which can be traced by autoradiography with 35SO4 and [3H]glucose; the mucus is secreted every 2-3 h. This is seen in gastric foveolar cells, in pyloric gland cells, in Brunner's gland cells, and in intestinal absorptive cells. More mucus is produced and secreted in the daytime.\r"

To investigate the influence of these groups of agents on the gastric mucosal microcirculation, quantitative intravital microscopy of the rat gastric mucosal microcirculation was performed. Single vessel blood flow, calculated from red blood cell velocity and diameter measurements, increased when PGE1, PGE2, 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2, or omeprazole were applied intraluminally. These results suggest that the increase in blood flow may, at least in part, be the reason for the protective action of these substances. A considerably reduced blood flow, such as occurs during hemorrhagic shock, is known to induce gastric bleeding, and also to induce neutrophil adherence to the endothelial wall. Neutrophil antiserum was used to determine whether neutropenia offered protection against hemorrhagic shock-induced gastric bleeding in anesthetized rats. Depletion of neutrophils resulted in higher blood flow during the ischemic period and also attenuated reperfusion-induced gastric damage. Maintenance of blood flow at the same level in untreated rats resulted in a similar reduction of mucosal damage. Thus, the major mechanism by which neutrophils appeared to increase damage in this model of gastric mucosal injury was by increasing microvascular resistance, thereby presumably intensifying tissue hypoxia. This paper is a summary review of previous studies.\r"

Gastric mucosal blood flow was determined by the hydrogen gas clearance method as well as the hydrogen gas electrolytic method, and the microvascular structure was observed by the infusion method with two-colored silicon rubber. The gastric mucosal blood flow decreased significantly in the early period after induction of burn stress. The incidence of acute gastric mucosal lesions had a highly correlative relation with the decrease in mucosal blood flow. Reduction of mucosal blood flow was consequently due to opening of an arteriovenous shunt and hyperpermeability of true capillaries. This hemodynamic change, regulated by biogenic amines and autonomic nerves, was followed by ischemia and congestion of the gastric mucosa. The results of these studies demonstrated the importance of defensive factors; that reduction of mucosal blood flow resulted in the sequence of events that led to formation of acute gastric mucosal lesions.\r"

However, when both DDC and AT were administered together, gastric mucosal SOD activity and GMBF remarkably decreased, and gastric ulcers appeared. Moreover, the administration of SOD attenuated gastric ulcer induced by DDC plus AT.

The topical administration of either ethanol (greater than or equal to 20%), indomethacin (0.1 mg/kg), leukotriene C4 (0.1 microgram), and platelet activating factor (PAF) (125 micrograms) decreased mucosal blood flow and mucosal blood oxygenation. The subsequent reperfusion of blood and/or addition of hydrocholoride (0.2 N) induced the gastric bleeding and ulceration. Pretreatment with calcium channel blockers (verapamil, flunaridine, and diltiazem) significantly reduced the gastric lesions induced by mucosal ischemia followed by reperfusion. Lipid peroxidation increased only after reperfusion, which was also blocked by pretreatment with calcium channel blockers. Thus, the calcium ion influx and the membrane lipid peroxidation followed by mucosal hypoxia might have a role in the mucosal cell death. The results indicate that the gastric surface mucosal circulation plays an important role in the mucosal protection against high concentrations of ethanol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), PAF, and leukotriene C4.\r"

Histamine, carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), or tetragastrin were given subcutaneously 30 or 60 min before the rats were killed. The PGE2 level in the fundic mucosa was measured. PGE2 synthesis in isolated gastric mucosa incubated with histamine, carbachol, or tetragastrin was also assayed. Gastric mucosal injury and protection was assessed according to Robert's method. The level of mucosal PGE2 was increased by histamine, carbachol, or tetragastrin in a dose-related way. The synthesis of PGE2 was increased by histamine, and this effect was inhibited by the addition of cimetidine. Carbachol slightly stimulated PGE2 synthesis, but tetragastrin had no such effect. Histamine (4-20 mg/kg) significantly prevented gastric damage induced by 0.6 N HCl judged macroscopically; this effect was overcome by cimetidine. Carbachol protected the rat gastric mucosa from damage induced by 0.6N HCl, and this effect was diminished by pirenzepine. Tetragastrin (4 micrograms/kg) significantly reduced gastric necrosis caused by 0.6 N HCl in a dose-related manner. We concluded that secretagogues such as histamine, carbachol, or tetragastrin through increasing endogenous PGE2 protect the gastric mucosa.\r"

Seventy percent ethanol administration caused marked reduction in mucus glycoprotein content (about 50% of control) as well as severe gastric mucosal damage. Treatment with two PGE derivatives (10-100 micrograms/kg) prior to 70% ethanol administration markedly inhibited the gross mucosal lesion, whereas the glycoprotein content under these conditions was significantly less than that in the untreated control group (ranging from 67-88% of control). Pretreatment with 20% ethanol markedly inhibited the gross mucosal damage caused by 70% ethanol dosing but the inhibition in the reduction of mucus glycoprotein content was restricted to about 80% of the untreated controls.

The surface epithelial cells synthesized 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane (TX) B2 predominantly, and less PGE2. Indomethacin completely inhibited synthesis of these prostanoids. This agent induced cellular damage in a dose-related way and this damage was inhibited by 10(-6) M dmPGE2. Indomethacin alone at the dose of 10(-4) M, at which synthesis of prostanoids was completely inhibited, did not affect the viability of the cells, but made the cells susceptible to damage caused by 15% ethanol. This effect of a minimum dose of indomethacin was inhibited by 10(-6) M dmPGE2. These results suggest that dmPGE2 has a direct protective effect on the isolated gastric cells in rats, and this effect is not limited to a specific cell type. That endogenous prostanoids have a possible role in the maintenance of cellular integrity is also postulated.\r"

  ".W": "In healthy volunteers, we studied the cellular target sites of alcohol-induced gastric mucosal injury and prostaglandin-induced protection with special emphasis on the mucosal microvascular ultrastructure. Subjects received pretreatment with saline or 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 1 micrograms/kg b.w. and 15 min later 40 ml of 60% alcohol were sprayed on the gastric mucosa through an endoscope. Mucosal biopsies were obtained at 15 and 30 min after alcohol administration for assessment of injury by light and transmission electron microscopy. Alcohol administration to saline-pretreated subjects produced severe damage to gastric mucosal microvascular endothelium. Injury consisted of rupture of the microvessels with formation of intramucosal hemorrhages, platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition, and on occasion total necrosis of the microvessels. In contrast, in the prostaglandin-pretreated group, alcohol-induced damage to the mucosal microvessels and hemorrhages were greatly reduced at both 15 and 30 min after alcohol administration. In separate group of subjects, we investigated the effect of prostaglandin alone (without alcohol) on the gastric mucosal microvessel ultrastructure. We found that prostaglandin produced prominent ultrastructural changes in the capillaries, which may be the basis for its protective action. This study demonstrated that the human gastric mucosal microvasculature is an important target site of alcohol injury and prostaglandin protection. The direct effect of prostaglandin on endothelial ultrastructure may render it more resistant to alcohol injury. While protection of the endothelial cell lining of the mucosal microvasculature represents an example of a broader phenomenon of protective action of prostaglandin on various cells, the crucial strategic role of the microvasculature makes preservation (protection) of its integrity of special importance for the gastric mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "The time course of gastric mucosal surface epithelial cell damage and macroscopically visible lesions in response to restraint and water-immersion stress (22 degrees C) in rats was examined, and the prophylactic effects on it of 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) were compared with those of papaverine, timoprazole, and atropine. The stress produced surface epithelial cell damage prior to visible lesion, the former increasing in severity with time and reaching a plateau 60 min later, by which time exfoliation of surface epithelial cells was observable along the mucosal folds. In contrast, macroscopically visible lesions appeared 2 h after stress, and severity continued to increase with time. Pretreatment injections (s.c.) of dmPGE2 (3 and 30 micrograms/kg), papaverine (100 mg/kg), and atropine (1 mg/kg) protected the surface cells against stress-induced (1 h) damage, and inhibited visible lesion formation after 4 h stress. Timoprazole (30 mg/kg s.c.) did not protect the surface cells, but did markedly inhibit visible lesion formation. DmPGE2, papaverine, and atropine, but not timoprazole, inhibited stress-induced increases in gastric contractions. DmPGE2, timoprazole, and atropine, but not papaverine, inhibited acid secretion in stress conditions. These results indicated that stress induced damage to the gastric mucosa within 1 h due to increased gastric contractions, and the surface epithelial cell damage developed into macroscopically visible lesions in the presence of acid, and that dmPGE2 protected the surface epithelium against stress-induced damage probably by inhibiting gastric contractions.\r"

Intragastric administration of ammonia (0.6-1.0%) and ethanol (60-100%) produced hemorrhagic necrosis of gastric mucosa in a concentration-dependent manner. In the anesthetized rat, the macroscopic lesions induced by ethanol were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with 3 or 10 micrograms/kg of 16,16-dmPGE2, but the lesions induced by ammonia were not inhibited by either 3 or 10 micrograms/kg of 16,16-dmPGE2 in the anesthetized rat. The decrease of gastric transmucosal potential difference and mucosal blood flow produced by ethanol (100%) were significantly attenuated by 16,16-dmPGE2; however, those produced by ammonia (1%) were not inhibited by 16,16-dmPGE2 in the anesthetized rat. In conscious rats, ammonia-induced lesions were not inhibited by pretreatment with 3 micrograms/kg of 16,16-dmPGE2 but they were significantly reduced by the pretreatment of 10 micrograms/kg of 16,16-dmPGE2. These results show that 16,16-dmPGE2 afforded little protection against ammonia-induced gastric lesions in the anesthetized rat and suggest that a different mechanism is involved in the development of gastric mucosal lesions between those induced by ethanol and those induced by ammonia.\r"

In order to label the proliferating cells, tritiated thymidine was injected 72 h prior to the stress. Histoautoradiography was prepared for the measurement of cell migration and residual mucosal DNA-bound radioactivity by means of liquid scintillation count for cell loss. Residual DNA-bound radioactivity was significantly decreased in fundic mucosa, but not in antral mucosa, after 60-90 min of water-immersion restraint stress. Cell migration was also found to be accelerated in fundic mucosa after 90 min of stress. These results indicate that water-immersion restraint stress results in an increase of cell loss, which is accompanied by compensated acceleration of cell migration, in fundic mucosa of rats before the development of gastric erosions. In view of the previous observation that stress for the same short-term duration inhibits fundic epithelial proliferation in rats, this combination, increased cell loss with depressed epithelial proliferation, may contribute to stress-related gastric mucosal lesions in rats.\r"

Fasted rats were injected subcutaneously with 10 micrograms/kg body weight of PGE2 or saline. After 30 min, animals received orally 100% EtOH or an equal volume of saline. Gastric mucosa was sampled at 5 min and 1, 2, 8, and 24 h post-EtOH and tissues procured for scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Both mucosal epithelial and connective tissue compartments were assessed. At 5 min after EtOH, in saline-pretreated animals, tissues showed extensive destruction of epithelium and connective tissue; major breaks in the basal laminae were coincident with hemorrhage. Deep-lying epithelial cells and most of the basal lamina were spared in tissues exposed to PGE2 prior to EtOH, permitting nearly complete repair within 24 h. Restitution proceeded over small breaks or pleats of basal lamina but failed in regions of total destruction of this structure. These data indicate that PGE2 protects not only deep-lying epithelial cells from EtOH damage but associated connective tissue as well and that sparing of both compartments leads to orderly and rapid epithelial restitution.\r"

  ".W": "Ts cells from mice tolerized with dinitrobenzene sulfonate produce a DNP-specific, MHC-restricted soluble suppressor factor (SSF) which regulates contact sensitivity to 2,4-dinitro-fluorobenzene. Previous studies have shown that the SSF-producing T cells and the soluble factor have the same hapten/MHC specificity suggesting that SSF may represent a secreted form of the Ts membrane receptor. The relationship between TCR proteins and SSF was investigated by examining the structural and serologic properties of a monoclonal DNP/H-2Kd-specific suppressor molecule produced by a Ts hybridoma. Reduction followed by alkylation abrogated the ability of the 3-10 molecule to inhibit transfer of contact sensitivity to 2,4-dinitro-fluorobenzene, indicating that intact disulfide bonds were a required structural property for suppression. Reduction of the 3-10 molecule followed by affinity chromatography on DNP-coupled Sepharose beads indicated that the 3-10 suppressor molecule is a dimer and that one of its chains binds to cell-free DNP. Serologic properties of the 3-10 molecule were examined by determining the ability of pan-reactive rabbit anti-TCR antibodies and anti-V beta 8 mAb KJ16.133 and F23.1 to adsorb suppressor activity from 3-10 culture supernatant and affinity purified 3-10 ascites material. All three reagents adsorbed the suppressor activity whereas control antibodies had no effect. When 3-10 material was passed through a F23.1-conjugated Sepharose affinity column, suppressor activity was recovered in the column eluate but not in the effluent fraction. When the 3-10 molecule was reduced and separated into its two chains (i.e., DNP-binding and non-DNP-binding chains), it was found that the anti-V beta 8 antibody F23.1-bound to the non-DNP-binding chain of the suppressor molecule. Collectively, these results indicate that the monoclonal 3-10 suppressor molecule is structurally similar to the alpha/beta TCR and suggest that the 3-10 molecule expresses a determinant encoded by the V beta 8 family of TCR genes. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that these suppressor molecules represent a secreted form of the TCR expressed on the surface of the DNP-specific Ts.\r"

LDA determination is based on the inhibition of growth of a highly TNF sensitive subline from the WEHI-164 fibrosarcoma by using a micro assay sensitive to single picogram amounts of recombinant murine TNF. Using such LDA, it was determined that the reported deficiency in LPS-induced TNF production in C3H/HeJ mice is a function of reduced frequency of TNF producing cells rather than a complete lack of responsiveness. In bulk culture, LPS-triggered TNF was produced by Thy-1.2 negative spleen cells with activity recovered in both G10 Sephadex adherent and nonadherent subpopulations. LPS stimulation of spleen cells from C3H/HeJ mice resulted in TNF mRNA expression as shown in both Northern blots and in situ hybridization. The frequency of TNF mRNA bearing cells in control of C3H/HeSnJ mice by in situ hybridization correlated with that found for TNF producing cells in LDA. In C3H/HeJ spleen, significantly higher numbers of TNF mRNA positive cells were found than were shown to produce TNF in LDA.\r"

In this study, we demonstrate that NK cells specifically lyse murine anti-CD16 hybridoma cell lines, but do not lyse hybridomas against other cell surface differentiation Ag expressed on NK cells. Moreover, the CD18 structure is involved in the CD16-specific xenogeneic interaction between human effector cells and murine hybridoma target cells. Although interaction with anti-CD16 hybridomas or antibodies triggers the cytolytic mechanism of NK cells, this interaction does not induce cellular proliferation. In contrast to NK cells, CD16+ granulocytes do not lyse anti-CD16 hybridoma cell targets and do not mediate ADCC against antibody-coated human tumor cell targets. These findings indicate a fundamental difference in the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity mechanisms of NK cells and granulocytes. Comparative biochemical analysis of CD16 on NK cells and granulocytes revealed significant differences in the size of the polypeptides obtained after removal of N-linked carbohydrate residues with endo-F and N-glycanase digestion.\r"

It was first shown, using IEF, followed by immunoprinting, that serum IgE antibodies from most grass-sensitive patients recognize both Dac g I and Lol p I. Second, three different anti-Lol p I mAb, 290A-167, 348A-6, and 539A-6, and one anti-Dac g I mAb, P3B2 were all shown to react with Dac g I and Lol p I, indicating that the two molecules share common epitopes. Epitope specificity of the mAb was determined by competitive binding inhibition of a given labeled mAb to solid phase fixed Dac g I or Lol p I by the mAb. The results indicated that the four mAb are directed against four different and non-overlapping epitopes present on both allergens. Using double-binding RIA, our data strongly suggest that the common epitopes are not repetitive on both molecules. In addition to their similar physicochemical characteristics, such as isolectric points and m.w., Dac g I and Lol p I share four identical epitopes. Binding inhibition of human IgE to Lol p I and Dac g I by the mAb was also assessed. The results indicated that each mAb was able to inhibit such reactions to variable degree but no additive inhibition was observed when two mAb of different specificities were used in combination, suggesting that the human IgE binding site is partially shared by each epitope recognized by the four mAb.\r"

The M21C5 Ag is a glycoprotein as shown by metabolic labeling with 3H-leucine and 2-[3H]-mannose. It has a broad distribution on most proliferating tissue culture cell lines tested, but is absent from several normal human tissues that were examined. Although not detected on unstimulated PBL, the expression of the M21C5 Ag could be induced by stimulation of PBL with the T cell mitogens PHA or Con A. Two-color fluorescence analysis showed that M21C5 is expressed on both CD4 and CD8 activated T cells. After mitogen stimulation, the expression of the M21C5 Ag was delayed relative to the expression of IL-2 and transferrin receptors. M21C5 glycoprotein was shown to be an integral membrane protein that is phosphorylated primarily on serine residues. Based on its biochemical and tissue distribution properties, M21C5 phosphoglycoprotein appears distinct from other known proliferation and activation-associated molecules.\r"

To identify and further characterize platelet C1q binding sites, human platelets were washed, solubilized in Triton X-100 and either subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by using monoclonal (II1/D1) and polyclonal antibodies recognizing C1qR on lymphoblastoid cells, or applied to a C1q-Sepharose affinity column under low ionic strength conditions (20 mM NaCl). Adherent proteins were eluted with buffer containing 300 mM NaCl. Western blotting with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against C1qR showed exclusive reactivity with a 67,000 m.w. protein possessing intrachain disulfide bonds. SDS-PAGE of C1q-Sepharose eluates also revealed the presence of a 67,000 protein which was accompanied to varying degrees by a 94,000 constituent. Because similar m.w., 125I-labeled proteins were recovered from C1q-Sepharose columns to which lysed, surface-labeled platelets had been applied, both 94,000 and 67,000 components appear to be platelet membrane constituents. The 94,000 and 67,000 species, however, appear to be antigenically distinct. The 94,000 protein was immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies against platelet membrane glycoprotein IIIa but not polyclonal antibodies against C1qR, whereas the 67,000 protein was immunoprecipitated exclusively by the polyclonal anti-C1qR antibody. The 67,000 protein thus appears to represent platelet C1q binding sites resembling C1qR on lymphoblastoid cells.\r"

Tracheal instillation of Ag (OVA) resulted in an elevation of airways pressure (14.4 +/- 0.6 cm H2O). Measurement of biliary peptide leukotriene levels before and after Ag challenge using reverse phase HPLC and RIA techniques showed significant elevations in leukotriene (LT) levels, the amounts released being LTC4 (3.65 +/- 0.78), LTD4 (2.8 +/- 1.11), and N-Ac LTE4 (3.87 +/- 1.15) expressed as ng/100 g of body weight, n = 13. Identification of these metabolites were confirmed by HPLC/RIA techniques and LTC4 was further characterized by UV spectroscopy and its enzymatic conversion by gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase to LTD4. [3H]LTC4 (16 ng) administration by tracheal instillation resulted in a 31.4 +/- 4.3% recovery of radioactivity through the bile over 4 h (n = 3) with the major identified metabolite being N-Ac LTE4. [3H]LTC4 (16 ng) plus synthetic LTC4 (5 micrograms) showed a 30.8 +/- 3.1% recovery through the bile after tracheal instillation (3-h collection, n = 4) with significant amounts of LTC4 as well as N-Ac LTE4 present. [3H]LTC4 administration by the portal vein resulted in a 37.4 +/- 8.8% biliary recovery over 60 min (n = 6), the metabolites present in the bile being LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and N-Ac LTE4. Pretreatment with the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor L-656,224 (15 mg/kg, 3.5 h pre-p.o.) before Ag challenge resulted in a significant inhibition (greater than 90%, p less than 0.05) of biliary leukotriene levels in this model. Our study demonstrates that peptide leukotrienes are produced in the anesthetized rat after pulmonary anaphylaxis and that biliary leukotriene measurement is suitable for showing the biochemical efficacy of leukotriene inhibitors in vivo. In vivo tracer experiments suggest that the biliary metabolic profile of the peptide leukotrienes is dependent on the site and levels of release as well as the efficiency of the vascular clearance of the various metabolites.\r"

Accordingly, C5a, purified from zymosan-activated human, and C5a des Arg, prepared by incubating C5a with immobilized porcine carboxypeptidase B, were studied for fibroblast chemotactic activity. We observed that both C5a and C5a des Arg stimulated human skin fibroblasts and fetal bovine ligament fibroblasts to migrate in a concentration-dependent fashion, and that the migratory responses were similar in magnitude to the responses achieved with optimal concentrations of two known fibroblast chemoattractants, platelet-derived growth factor and human fibrinopeptide B. The peak responses to C5a and C5a des Arg occurred at approximately 10(-9)M. With ligament fibroblasts, there was a greater response to C5a des Arg than to C5a, but with human fibroblasts there was no difference. Cochemotaxin, which enhances the chemotactic activity of C5a des Arg for neutrophils, had no effect on C5a des Arg fibroblast chemotactic activity but appeared to increase the fibroblast chemotactic activity of C5a. These results indicate that the effects of C5a and C5a des Arg in vivo may extend to the recruitment of mesenchymal cells. Moreover, the findings represent another example of an activity retained by C5a after removal of its carboxyl terminal arginine.\r"

  ".U": "89035484\r", 
  ".W": "Human neutrophil-derived histamine-releasing activity (HRA-N) was partially purified and found to contain a heat-stable 1400 to 2300-Da fraction which caused human basophils and rat basophil leukemia cells (RBL) to degranulate. The capacity of HRA-N to activate basophils was not related to the gender or atopic status of the basophil donor, but was related to anti-IgE responsiveness. Several lines of evidence suggest that HRA-N and anti-IgE induce histamine release through distinctly different mechanisms: 1) the time course of HRA-N- and anti-IgE-induced RBL histamine release are different; 2) HRA-N causes histamine release from RBL with and without surface-bound IgE; 3) lactic acid stripping of IgE from human basophils reduces anti-IgE-induced histamine release, but has no consistent effect on HRA-N-induced histamine release; and 4) passive sensitization of lactic acid-stripped basophils with IgE restores anti-IgE-induced histamine release but not HRA-N-induced histamine release. Several histamine-releasing factors (HRF) were compared with HRA-N. Human nasal HRF (HRF-NW, crude and partially purified fractions of 15 to 30, 3.5 to 9, and less than 3.5 kDa), like HRA-N, caused equal histamine release from both native and IgE-sensitized RBL. However, only the 15- to 30-kDa fraction caused histamine release from human basophils in the doses tested. Mononuclear cell HRF (HRF-M, crude and a partially purified 25 kDa Mr fraction) and platelet HRF (HRF-P, crude preparation) failed to cause histamine release from either native or IgE-sensitized RBL but caused 30 +/- 5.5% and 20 +/- 10% net histamine release from human basophils, respectively. HRA-N and HRF-NW were both stable to boiling. These data, taken together, suggest that the capacity of HRA-N to induce RBL and human basophil histamine release and of HRF-NW to stimulate RBL histamine release is independent of IgE. The data further suggest that HRA-N and HRF-NW can be distinguished by size, and that they both differ from mononuclear cell HRF and platelet HRF. Thus, it appears that inflammatory cells generate a family of distinct HRF.\r"

Using polyclonal serum specific for P30, we have isolated a P30 cDNA clone from a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library derived from tachyzoites of T. gondii (RH strain). This clone produces a beta-galactosidase fusion protein which reacts with several anti-P30 mAb. In addition, polyclonal anti-serum raised to the fusion protein reacts with purified P30 protein and exclusively with P30 in a whole cell lysate of T. gondii. This cDNA clone was used to isolate near full-length cDNA molecules and a cosmid clone containing the P30 gene. Sequence analysis of the cDNA reveals a single open reading frame with coding capacity for 34.7 kDa of primary translation product (consistent with the apparent Mr of P30 on SDS-acrylamide gels) including a presumptive hydrophobic signal sequence. The P30 primary translation product also has a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic tail which is predictive of a posttranslational cleavage and modification with a glycolipid anchor. We have identified the apparent 5' and 3' ends of the P30 mRNA transcript which is extremely abundant, 1500 nucleotides in length, and polyadenylated. The P30 gene is single copy and contains no introns.\r"

The results revealed that rabbits immunized with purified native M6 protein or whole streptococci responded by reacting early and predominantly to one of the three sequence repeat regions of the molecule, the B-repeat, antibodies which have been shown to be non-opsonic. Antibodies to peptides representing the hypervariable N-terminal and adjacent A-repeat regions appear when opsonic antibodies are detected in the serum. Antibodies to peptides located within the conserved C-terminal half of the molecule (proximal to the cell) were restricted even after several immunizations. An examination of human sera from individuals with no recent streptococcal infection (greater than 3 yr), revealed that those sera opsonic for M6 streptococci contained antibodies reactive predominantly to the N-terminal and A-repeat regions, supporting the view that opsonic antibodies are long lived. Nonopsonic human sera to M6 streptococci exhibited a low reactivity to all peptides. However, by Western blot analysis, all human sera tested contained antibodies to the conserved region of the molecule, whereas only sera opsonic for M6 streptococci reacted with the variable region. Evidence is presented supporting the view that antibodies to the conserved regions of the M molecule may be conformation dependent.\r"

Some mAb, which possess high neutralization activity in vitro, showed high protection, and JEV-specific N mAb 503 was found the most protective. Even an injection of 2.5 micrograms/mouse of mAb 503 protected all mice from JEV infection. Furthermore, an injection of about 200 micrograms of mAb 503 on day 5 postinfection protected 82% of the mice, even when JEV was detected in more than 85% of the infected mouse brains. Synergism of protection was observed with mixtures of several mAb directed against different epitopes. Although in a murine macrophage cell line, all of the mAb groups showed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of JEV infectivity in vitro, and only two flavivirus cross-reactive mAb groups showed ADE of dengue virus type 2. The ADE of JEV by mAb seems not to be harmful for in vivo protection experiments, except for two mAb groups: mAb 302 and 201 showed little or no protective activity against JEV infection and, rather, caused early death in infected mice.\r"

The results of nuclear run-on transcription and S1 nuclease digestion assays demonstrate that E beta transcription is normal in these haplotypes. Northern blot analyses reveal reduced amounts of E beta RNA of both normal and aberrant size in the w17 and q haplotypes; an even more reduced level of E beta RNA of normal size was detected in the f haplotype. In the preceding study, we reported that the only defect detected in the E beta w17 gene is a single nucleotide insertion in the 5' RNA splice site of the first intervening sequence. S1 nuclease analysis of E beta w17 RNA indicates that splicing at this site is aberrant. One major cryptic RNA splice site is used, leading to reduced amounts of aberrantly processed RNA. Limited use of the mutated splice site and of a second cryptic site also is detected. In all three cases, stop codons in the resulting RNA would prevent their translation. The molecular defect in E beta q appears identical to that of E beta w17. In the f haplotype, even more reduced levels of E beta RNA of both normal and aberrant sizes are found. We thus show that in the three defective E beta alleles, two distinct defects are responsible for the absence of E beta protein synthesis; both of these defects affect RNA processing.\r"

These E- haplotypes are defective in the expression of the E alpha and/or the E beta chain. None of the E beta defects has previously been described at the molecular level. In this study, we report the molecular basis for the defective expression of the E beta gene from the w17 haplotype of the H-2 congenic strain B10.CAS2, derived from wild Mus musculus castaneus. Comparison of the Ew17 beta genomic sequence to those of the functional Eb beta and Ed beta genes reveals a single base insertion in the RNA donor splice site of the first intron. By DNA shuffling, we have corrected the single base mutation, and we show by FACS analysis and 2-D PAGE of immunoprecipitates that the corrected Ew17 beta is expressed in L cells when co-transfected with an Ed alpha gene. Conversely, an Eb beta gene construct containing the mutant RNA splice site from Ew17 beta is not expressed. We conclude that the single base insertion in the first RNA splice donor site is the sole molecular defect in the Ew17 beta gene.\r"

  ".W": "C5 convertase of the alternative C pathway is a complex enzyme consisting of three C fragments--one molecule of a major fragment of factor B (Bb) and two molecules of a major fragment of C3 (C3b). Within this C3bBbC3b complex, the first C3b binds covalently to the target surface, and Bb, which bears a catalytic site, binds noncovalently to the first C3b. In the present investigation, we studied the nature of the convertase that is assembled on E surfaces and obtained evidence that the second C3b binds directly to the alpha'-chain of the first through an ester bond rather than to the target surface. Thus, the alternative pathway C5 convertase could be described as a trimolecular complex in which Bb binds noncovalently to a covalently linked C3b dimer. We also obtained evidence that not only the second C3b but also the first C3b participates in binding C5, that is, covalently-linked C3b dimer acts as a substrate-binding site. Because of this two-site binding, the convertase has a much higher affinity for C5 than the surrounding monomeric C3b molecules. Based on this evidence, a new model of the alternative pathway C5 convertase is proposed. Covalent association of two subunits and the bivalent binding of the substrate are then common properties of the alternative and classical pathway C5 convertases.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a method to initiate spontaneous activation of the first component of complement in serum, by the removal of C1-inhibitor through complexation with added C1s. Preliminary experiments to test this method using C1 reconstituted from its purified subcomponents led to an unexpected result: pre-incubation of the reassembled subcomponents with C1-inhibitor, followed by its removal with C1s, altered the subsequent pattern of spontaneous activation. Thus, pre-incubation with C1-inhibitor at 37 degrees C for 1 h resulted in sigmoidal activation of C1 with a prolonged lag phase. In contrast, pre-incubation with C1-inhibitor on ice for the same time resulted in subsequent rapid, pseudo first order activation of C1 with a half-life of about 5 min. We have examined the activation kinetics under a variety of conditions, and our data are consistent with a model proposed by Lepow and coworkers in 1965, involving both spontaneous activation and C1 catalyzed activation: (1) C1----k1 C1 (2) C1----k2C1 C1 According to this model, the role of C1-inhibitor is to eliminate the second step by rapidly forming a tight complex with C1 which becomes irreversible at 37 degrees C. When C1s was added to normal human serum, activation at 37 degrees C was also sigmoidal, similar to that of reconstituted C1.\r"

In this study, we characterized binding of the chemotactic peptide FMLP to whole PMN, with particular attention to those variables that may account for the wide variation reported in the literature. These included avoidance of oxidized FMLP as a radioligand contaminant, determination of the optimal cold ligand concentration necessary for achieving minimal nonspecific binding throughout the range of radioligand concentrations used in saturation experiments (greater than or equal to 5 x 10(-5) M), avoidance of radioligand concentrations that equal or exceed receptor saturation and are not suitable for Scatchard analysis (greater than or equal to 60 to 80 nM), and avoidance of inadvertent receptor mobilization due to room temperature PMN isolation techniques and cell warming. PMN isolated and maintained at 4 degrees C expressed a single, high affinity population of FMLP receptors (approximately 6000 receptors per cell) with a KD of 15.5 nM. These characteristics, and in particular the single-affinity nature of the expressed FMLP receptor site, were derived from saturation experiments and confirmed with agonist competition studies. PMN subjected to room temperature isolation or 37 degrees C warming exhibited a 2.5-fold increase in FMLP receptor expression (approximately 15,000 receptors per cell) without changes in receptor affinity. These latter PMN, in correlation with increased receptor expression, had increased initial, maximal rates of FMLP-induced superoxide generation (10.2 vs 6.3 nmol/min/10(6) PMN for cells isolated and maintained at 4 degrees C) as a manifestation of their functional activation. The avoidance of inadvertent cellular activation during PMN isolation is essential to studies of PMN function, activation and the role of FMLP receptor expression/mobilization in these processes.\r"

When cloned human NK cells (CD16+/CD3-) were exposed to NK-sensitive targets for 30 min, the level of inositol phosphates rose two to five times above background. The rise in inositol phosphates induced by NK-sensitive targets was paralleled by an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). A panel of tumor cells that were resistant to NK cell lysis did not stimulate significant levels of inositol phosphate production and did not induce an elevation of intracellular free calcium. Ligation of the FcR (CD16) with the mAb 3G8 also triggered phosphoinositide turnover. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that stimulation by either susceptible target cells or by FcR ligation led to rapid (less than 1 min) generation of the Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger, inositol trisphosphate, with slower accumulation of inositol bisphosphate and inositol monophosphate. Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of the cAMP-dependent second messenger pathway strongly inhibits NK cell-mediated cytotoxic functions. Treatment of NK effector cells with forskolin to elevate intracellular cAMP levels resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis induced by both NK-sensitive targets and 3G8-mediated FcR ligation. These results suggest that phosphoinositide turnover represents a critical early event in the human NK cell cytolytic process. Moreover, the potent inhibitory effect of cAMP on NK cell cytotoxicity may be explained by the uncoupling of NK receptors from phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis.\r"

In Lettre cells, damage is restricted and reversible: little lactate dehydrogenase leaks from cells that leak substantial amounts of Na+, K+, and phosphoryl[3H]choline; at low amounts of cytolysin, membrane potential and intracellular content of Na+ and K+ recover within minutes. In E and Lettre cells, membrane damage is inhibited by Zn2+, by high Ca2+, or by low pH. Inhibition is reversible: addition of EGTA to Zn2+-protected E or Lettre cells (incubated in the presence of cytolysin, low Ca2+ and Zn2+) initiates leakage; removal of Zn2+ (and cytolysin and Ca2+) by washing also initiates leakage; such leakage is again sensitive to Zn2+, high Ca2+, or H+. In phospholipid bilayers, channels induced by cytolysin (at low Ca2+) are partially closed by negative voltage; Ca2+, Zn2+, or H+ promote channel closure. Channels are re-opened (only partially in the case of Zn2+) by positive voltage. From all these results it is concluded that the action of cytolysin on membranes is similar to that of other pore-forming agents: damage does not necessarily lead to lysis of nucleated cells, and can be prevented by Ca2+, Zn2+, or H+.\r"

In the assay for cytokine, a few of the hybridomas produced a novel tumor-killing factor (TKF) after stimulation with PMA, polypeptone, and retinoic acid. Chemical nature of the TKF from the 3-63 hybrid clone was characterized and compared to those of well-known TNF and lymphotoxin. The TKF from a hybridoma was basic protein and had binding capacity to Con A-Sepharose, whereas TNF had an opposite nature. Moreover, TKF activity was not neutralized by both a murine monoclonal antibody against human TNF and rabbit antisera against human lymphotoxin. Thus, these results strongly indicate that the TKF is a novel TKF produced by human monocytic cells.\r"

Specificity was thus greatly enhanced with minimal loss of sensitivity. Because preadsorption of these cross-reactive sera to remove antibodies to PC eliminated only approximately 50% of the original cross-reactivity, other shared epitopes (perhaps similar to PC) are also likely to be restricted by IgG subclass.\r"

The emulsion formulation and Fungizone were equipotent for treating systemic candidiasis in mice. Amphotericin B nephrotoxicity, as manifested by polyuria that was resistant to antidiuretic hormone, was markedly diminished when amphotericin B was administered as an emulsion to rats. Loss of potassium from human red blood cells was also reduced by formulating this agent within emulsions.

There were no qualitative differences in the precipitin responses against the virus-encoded proteins in three different infected cellular antigens (cytoplasmic, nuclear, and high-speed pellet) between these three groups of women. There was also no qualitative difference in responses whether the infection was clinically apparent or subclinical. Quantitation by densitometer, however, revealed that women with mononucleosis and those with subclinical infection who infected their fetuses had a more intense and prolonged antibody response than did women with subclinical infection who failed to transmit CMV in utero.\r"

Resistance increased from 3.8% to 14.1% among isolates from blood and from 6.8% to 14.1% among CSF isolates during this period. Comparing 1979-1982 with 1983-1986, we found that significant increases (P less than .01) have occurred in penicillin resistance alone, rifampin resistance alone, and in strains showing multiple resistance. Resistance was found in 15 different serogroups and/or serotypes, although 92.2% of resistant strains belonged to serogroups 6 or 19 or to serotype 14. Of the serogrouped or serotyped strains, 97.4% are represented in the 23-valent vaccine by a vaccine or vaccine-related strain.\r"

Sixty-eight of them also had significant increases in at least one antibody class as measured by ELISA. Seventeen patients had significant increases in at least one antibody class without increases in neutralizing antibodies. All 163 serum samples with neutralizing antibodies also had detectable IgG, whereas 14 samples with IgG and 18 with IgM were negative by neutralization test. Thus, toxin-neutralizing serum antibodies develop in most patients with pertussis. Our ELISA, however, was more sensitive in detecting low levels of antibodies and in demonstrating significant increases between acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples.\r"

Consequently, we retrospectively studied the 52 couples in whom fertilization failed during Norfolk series 18 to 25, in an effort to establish the precise causes of failure. In the initial evaluation, pure oocyte abnormalities were identified in 19.2% of the cases; 32.6% showed sperm abnormalities, and a combination of oocyte and sperm anomalies was found in 7.7%. In 40.4% of the cases, failure of fertilization could not be explained. Reassessment of sperm morphology by new, strict criteria increased the identification of sperm abnormalities to 61.5% and of combined sperm and oocyte anomalies to 13.4%, for a total of 74.9% of sperm factors involved, as opposed to 40.3% in the original evaluation. The incidence of unexplained failed fertilization was substantially reduced, to 11.5%. In a control group (tubal infertility) matched by age, date, and stimulation, in whom fertilization occurred, 83.3% had normal sperm parameters as judged by the new criteria for morphology evaluation. This paper emphasizes the need for a more accurate diagnosis of sperm abnormalities to establish the true incidence of this factor in failed fertilization and to obtain information of prognostic value to patients and clinicians.\r"

When the first 21 couples (Group A) had been treated in the program, the rate of pregnancy achieved was 23.8%, which did not seem satisfactory. This might have been caused by the distance between the embryo laboratory and the operating room. To eliminate this defect, a Mobile Oocyte Incubation Unit (MOIU) was designed. This is actually a compact laboratory that can be placed in the operating room. After the MOIU was utilized, the rate of pregnancy for the following 19 couples (Group B) increased to 42.1%. The MOIU has helped improve the performance of the GIFT program by increasing the stability of the pH value of the culture medium (Chetkowski R, et al.: J Vitro Fert Embryo Transfer 1985;2:207), lessening the exposure of the gametes to air and room temperature, and most importantly, shortening the time required for a GIFT procedure from 45-100 to 15-30 min. We expect that the MOIU will eventually become an integral part of the standard equipment for the GIFT program and make the program more successful and reliable in the treatment of infertility.\r"

These pregnancies were obtained, in one group, during a natural cycle, while, in the other group, they resulted from gamete intrafallopian transfers performed in hyperstimulated cycles. A logarithmic regression analysis was chosen to allow statistical comparison of serial plasmatic evaluation as hormone determinations were obtained, among patients, at different postovulatory days. The regression lines of the two groups of patients presented similar slopes. The unpaired t test performed on calculated data for 3 different days constantly revealed significantly higher levels (P less than 0.005) of natural vs stimulated cycles; thus a different origin on the x axis (days of the luteal phase) is deduced. These findings support the possibility of a delay in the appearance of human chorionic hormone in the patients undergoing gamete intrafallopian transfer technique.\r"

Ninety-one percent fertilization and 100% cleavage rates, respectively, were observed in one of the two patients. No fertilization occurred in the second patient. In both women, in vitro sperm penetration tests revealed hostile mucus and repeated postcoital tests were poor. It is concluded that the sperm-cervical mucus penetration test and mucus ASA measurements are useful in establishing the diagnosis of immunological infertility.\r"

While performing tests on this subject in our laboratory, two unexpected variables were identified that can influence the effect of human serum on mouse embryo cultures. In a standard embryo culture system in which heat-inactivated sera (10% final concentration) were added to two-cell mouse embryos and percentage blastocyst development was scored after 4 days, sera that had been collected into standard clinical Monoject blood collection red-stopper tubes were significantly more embryotoxic than sera collected from the same subjects into 15-ml Falcon centrifuge tubes (P less than 0.005). Furthermore, we observed that sera from laboratory personnel that worked with mice often inhibited mouse embryo development. To study this effect further, sera were collected from five fertile individuals who were routinely exposed to mice and from fertile women with no previous exposure to rodents. Sera from the mouse-exposed group were significantly more inhibitory than sera from the nonexposed control group (P less than 0.005). The effect was observed in the ammonium sulfate-precipitated immunoglobulin fraction of the mouse-exposed group's sera, and high titers of antibodies reactive with mouse spleen cells were detected in sera and immunoglobulin fractions from this group by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Embryotoxic activity was neutralized by absorption with mouse lymphocytes, but not with rabbit or human lymphocytes, suggesting that a heterophilic antimouse antibody is the factor responsible for this effect. These data emphasize the importance of including extensive controls in experiments addressing toxic effects of human sera on mouse embryos.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine the possible influence of different stimulation protocols and retrieval techniques on the incidence of FZOs, to analyze possible causes, and to evaluate the significance of FZOs in terms of IVF/ET results. Four hundred thirty-three cycles in which one or more FZOs were recovered (fractured-zona cycles; FZCs) and 1114 cycles in which FZOs were not obtained (intact-zona cycles; IZCs) were studied. A significantly higher number of follicles was aspirated in FZCs (7.16 +/- 3.5) than in IZCs (6.43 +/- 3.56), yielding significantly fewer immature oocytes in FZCs (1.58 +/- 1.93 vs 1.88 +/- 2.16) and a significantly higher number of atretic oocytes in FZCs (2.06 +/- 1.36 vs 0.73 +/- 1.21). No statistically significant difference was observed when the number of preovulatory oocytes obtained was compared. Nor were statistically significant differences observed as a result of either the type of stimulation [human chorionic gonadotropin (hMG), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or a combination] or the aspiration technique utilized (laparoscopy vs ultrasonically guided puncture). Peripheral estradiol and progesterone and follicular fluid estradiol, progesterone, and androstenedione comparisons showed no significant differences. However, endocrine and morphologic findings (higher follicular androstenedione levels and estradiol/progesterone ratio, degenerated ooplasms) suggested some degree of late oocyte atresia, possibly due to slight hyperstimulation. In an experimental study, two healthy immature oocytes matured in vitro to the metaphase II stage showed degenerative changes in the ooplasm within 20 min after being subjected to mechanical zona pellucida (ZP) damage (mechanical fracture).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

D-Xylose absorption was characterized by an absorption rate constant (ka) and a rate constant reflecting nonabsorptive removal of D-xylose from the small bowel (ko). In normal subjects, mean ka was 0.915 +/- 0.228/hr (+/- SD), and the extent of oral D-xylose absorption averaged 81.0% +/- 11.6%. In seven of the 12 patients, D-xylose absorption was less than 60% complete. In four of them, ka was below the normal limit of 0.367/hr and was consistent with a primary defect in intestinal D-xylose absorption. Two patients with low ka values and the remaining three patients with less than 60% D-xylose absorption had ko values exceeding 0.650/hr, suggesting that excessive nonabsorptive loss contributed to low D-xylose bioavailability. We found that standard tests may identify some patients as having primary defects in D-xylose absorption rate or nonabsorptive loss and propose that breath H2 concentration measurements may also help distinguish between bacterial overgrowth and rapid intestinal transit as causes of excessive nonabsorptive loss.\r"

It is not clear whether a respiratory compensation (hypercapnia) develops with this alkalosis; patients with liver cirrhosis, most of them with hypoproteinemia, are known to hyperventilate. We studied 23 clinically stable patients with hypoproteinemia, with very low albumin-to-globulin ratios (range 0.4 to 1.1), who had either liver cirrhosis (n = 12) or other medical conditions (n = 11). In both groups, there was marked hypocapnia, accompanied by alkalemia (PaCO2 values (mean +/- SD) 31 +/- 2 and 32 +/- 3 torr; pH (mean +/- SD) 7.45 +/- 0.03 and 7.47 +/- 0.03, for the patients with cirrhosis and those without, respectively). Hypoxemia was not the stimulus provoking hyperventilation. The lowering of PaCO2 was proportional to the reduction of serum albumin and total protein concentrations; no detectable difference was seen between the patients with cirrhosis and those without cirrhosis in this apparent dependence of PaCO2 on the concentration of serum proteins. Many of these clinically stable patients with hypoproteinemia, with or without liver cirrhosis, had appreciable concentrations of unidentified anions in plasma (inappropriately high anion gap). Whatever the nonrespiratory acid-base status of the patients with hypoproteinemia, their pulmonary ventilation (hypocapnia) appeared excessive when compared with subjects (presumably) without proteinemia who had similar nonrespiratory acid-base states. The mechanism responsible for the hyperventilation in hypoproteinemia and the nature of the unidentified anions in this condition are obscure.\r"

We used consensus cut points of total cholesterol levels greater than 200, greater than 220, and greater than 240 mg/dl for moderate risk of coronary heart disease and greater than 220, greater than 240, and greater than 260 for high risk for aged 20 through 29, 30 through 39, and greater than 40 years. Total cholesterol level was in the moderate- or high-risk range in 45% and 37% of the venous and capillary cohorts, respectively. Median venous and capillary total cholesterol values were approximately 20 and 10 mg/dl greater than the total cholesterol values in the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study, a difference contributed to by nonfasting versus fasting conditions, use of serum versus plasma, and self-referral bias for subjects with a family history of premature coronary heart disease. The cost per subject in the venous and capillary studies was $5.09 and $7.12 respectively, and $11.40 and $ 18.63 for each subject in the moderate- to high-risk range.

The highest mean value was a 29-fold increase in activity. Three peaks of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity were observed over the same time span. The first peak occurred at 45 hours, showing a sevenfold to eightfold increase in activity. Histologic evidence of necrosis peaked at 12 to 24 hours and was prominent over 54 hours. Periportal inflammation in response to the cellular injury was prominent from 12 to 96 hours and peaked at 45 to 62 hours. The curve of mitoses peaked at the same time as that of TK activity but was only 68% as extensive. The first peak of ODC activity occurred before there was any significant presence of mitoses or of TK activity. A smaller dose of 400 mg/kg resulted in a narrow peak of TK activity at 62 hours that was a 37-fold increase in activity. The total TK response was 43% of that seen after the larger dose, about in proportion to the dose given. The first ODC peak, representing the earliest evidence of regeneration, was earlier and more prominent after the 400 mg/kg dose. On the basis of areas under the curves, the amounts of necrosis and of periportal inflammation after 400 mg/kg were 36% of those seen after 1000 mg/kg. Corresponding figures for other response curves were 29% for mitoses, 33% for serum SGPT, and 71% for total ODC activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the bleeding tendency that follows the administration of ticlopidine, we investigated the skin bleeding time and some ex vivo functions of platelets from nine patients with insulin-dependent diabetes before and 2 weeks after daily doses of 500 mg ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly prolonged bleeding time and reduced platelet reactivity to fixed, relatively high concentrations of aggregating agents, without interfering with thromboxane B2 formation. We used a rotating probe device at a relatively low shear rate (570 sec-1) to measure platelet adhesion to human subendothelium. This system was able to detect an impairment of platelet adhesion dependent on glycoprotein (GP) Ib defect (Bernard Soulier syndrome) or on low platelet von Willebrand factor content, but was insensitive to platelet GPIIb-IIIa defect (Glanzmann's thrombasthenia). In our patients, platelet adhesion was consistently reduced after the administration of ticlopidine. We conclude that ticlopidine is an inhibitor of platelet function that modulates the interaction between platelets. The drug also appears to interfere with mechanisms that modulate platelet-subendothelium interaction at relatively low shear rates. This double action could be relevant in the prevention of vasculopathy in patients with diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "We have used a general quenched-flow approach to study platelet function as early as 0.3 seconds after stimulation with a low concentration of adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) (0.5 mumol/L), epinephrine (15 mumol/L), or a combination of the two. Compared with ADP alone, the combination nearly doubled the rate of aggregation as measured by the loss of single particles. Our aim was to determine whether the aggregation, protein phosphorylation, and cytoplasmic calcium responses to this potentiating combination of ADP and epinephrine were analogous to those caused by a maximal concentration of ADP (10 mumol/L) and also to determine whether cyclooxygenase was involved in this potentiation. Phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and the 47 kd protein were analyzed during the first 5 seconds of platelet response and were related to the progress of aggregation. Unlike aggregation, ADP-induced phosphorylations of both MLC and the 47 kd protein were inhibited rather than potentiated by epinephrine. Pretreatment of the platelets with indomethacin did not affect aggregation or MLC phosphorylation, but increased 47 kd phosphorylation at 0.6 seconds and eliminated it at 3 seconds. Cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) of indo-1-loaded platelets were monitored with our continuous-flow fluorescence approach. Although epinephrine itself did not change [Ca2+]i, it potentiated the [Ca2+]i rise induced by a low dose of ADP. A comparison of these results with platelet activation caused by 10 mumol/L ADP indicates that MLC and 47 kd phosphorylations are not correlated with [Ca2+]i dynamics and are not required or directly involved in platelet aggregation.\r"

Treatment with the H2O2 scavenger catalase or the superoxide anion (O2-) scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD) did not significantly reduce proteinuria. In contrast, treatment with the hydroxyl radical (OH.) scavengers dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dimethylthiourea resulted in significant decrements in proteinuria, from 156 +/- 20 mg/24 hours in saline solution--treated control rats to 70 +/- 17 mg/24 hours (p less than 0.05) and 37 +/- 10 mg/24 hours (p less than 0.01) in DMSO- and dimethylthiourea-treated rats, respectively. Therapy with DMSO for 5 days after induction of glomerular disease also resulted in amelioration of proteinuria, 10.0 +/- 5.0 mg/24 hours versus saline solution-treated rats, 67.6 +/- 16.2 mg/24 hours (p less than 0.005). OH. scavenger therapy did not influence glomerular morphology, glomerular immunoglobulin G (IgG), or complement deposition, or creatinine clearances of rats with glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in serum levels of C3 and C5 or anti-BGG antibody production between DMSO-treated rats and control rats. None of the radical scavengers administered altered the enhanced glomerular thromboxane synthesis characteristic of this model. Our results suggest that OH. generation mediates in part glomerular injury in cBGG-induced glomerulonephritis.\r"

To test the hypothesis that similar techniques can be used to categorize disease states in humans, we examined the mRNA activity profiles by using in vitro translational assays of Ficoll-Hypaque-separated mononuclear cells obtained from six normal volunteers, six patients with type I diabetes, and five patients with type II diabetes as example of different disease states. Translated proteins were labeled with sulfur 35-labeled methionine, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and quantitated by videodensitometry of autoradiographs derived from the two-dimensional gels. Of approximately 160 quantitated mRNAs, the levels of 12 were found to be altered in one of the diabetic states. The values of nine were changed in patients with type I diabetes and the values of 11 were altered in patients with type II diabetes. Although the values of most mRNAs increased, significant decreases were also observed. Moreover, four spots showed significant differences in response between the two diabetic states. Discriminant analysis allowed the separation of all three states. Finally, several mRNAs also displayed an age-related correlation. We have demonstrated that unstimulated mononuclear cell mRNAs can be used to study the effects of pathophysiologic states on gene expression in humans. Furthermore, our results support the potential use of this issue to study the effect of a wide variety of disease states on gene expression.\r"

For total IgG, the half-life found was 25.8 days; for IgG1 it was 29.7 days; for IgG2 it was 26.9 days; and for IgG3 it was 15.7 days. The results are similar to those reported for endogeneous IgG. Half-lives for antibodies to S. minnesota (Re 595 mutant), cytomegalovirus, and S. pneumoniae were of the same order of magnitude as that for total IgG. We conclude that this IGIV preparation is catabolized in patients with primary immunodeficiency at a rate similar to that of native IgG in normal individuals.\r"

  ".W": "Heparin is commonly used to treat neonatal thrombosis. Drug monitoring often involves assays that measure the inhibition of added factor Xa or thrombin by the antithrombin III (AT-III) heparin complex. We examined whether the neonatal AT-III deficiency affects heparin recovery in such assays at therapeutic drug concentrations (0.1 to 0.6 U/ml). The chromogenic anti-factor Xa assay (Teien AN, Lie M, Abildgaard U. Thromb Res 1976;8:413-6) and the protamine titration test were performed in eight pooled cord plasma samples and in normal adult plasma. Only 65% to 70% of heparin activity detected in adult plasma was recovered by the assay of Teien et al. In cord plasma; recovery by the protamine test was 80% or less. Heparin recovery in cord plasma was significantly improved by raising the AT-III concentration to normal adult levels in both assays. We conclude that heparin assays underestimate drug levels in neonatal plasma unless the neonatal AT-III deficiency is fully corrected in the test system. The use of standard assays may lead to over-heparinization of newborn infants, thereby placing them at a higher risk of bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "Prolactin, administered exogenously, has been shown to be trophic to the liver, causing increases in the liver weight-to-body weight ratio. In ornithine decarboxylase activity, and in thymidine kinase activity. To investigate the effect of endogenous hyperprolactinemia on hepatic regeneration, pituitary isografts were placed beneath the renal capsule in rats 2 weeks before the rats underwent a two-thirds partial hepatectomy. Prolactin levels 2 weeks after the transplant were greater in the animals with the pituitary isografts compared with levels in controls. The increase in the liver weight-to-body weight ratio after hepatectomy was similar in the rats with pituitary transplant and the controls. However, chronic hyperprolactinemia was associated with increased basal levels of ornithine decarboxylase activity and thymidine kinase activity. Both ornithine decarboxylase activity and thymidine kinase activity increased after partial hepatectomy, and the magnitude of the changes was similar for both groups of animals. The levels of estrogen receptor activity before the partial hepatectomy and the reduction in receptor activity that follows partial hepatectomy were similar in the two groups of animals. Moreover, the levels of androgen receptor activity within the liver before partial hepatectomy and the increase in receptor activity after hepatectomy were similar in the two groups of animals. Thus, chronic sustained hyperprolactinemia has no beneficial effect on the hepatic regenerative response, despite induction of both basal ornithine decarboxylase and thymidine kinase activities.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this project was to investigate any differences in diagnostic practice between Chinese psychiatry and Western psychiatry with regard to severe psychiatric illness among Chinese inpatients. Specifically, the project aimed to look at differences between the Chinese diagnostic system and DSM-III. This study stemmed partly from a desire to investigate the supposed \"overdiagnosis\" of schizophrenia in China relative to the West. A second objective was to use a structured interview format to obtain clinical data for DSM-III and to decide whether a translated version of such an interview offered promise for future transcultural psychiatric research. Forty-two inpatients on a psychiatric ward in China were interviewed by an American psychiatrist assisted by a Chinese faculty translator and a diagnosis was made using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III. A Chinese professor of psychiatry who was blind to the structured interview results interviewed each patient independently and assigned a diagnosis within the current Chinese system. Follow-up data was obtained on 69% of the patients after 16 months to check for stability of diagnosis. Results of the study pointed to less diagnostic disagreement than previous work had predicted. On cases where there was disagreement, DSM-III diagnoses tended toward affective disorders or atypical forms of psychosis while the Chinese diagnosis tended towards schizophrenia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Reports examining social status and schizophrenia suggest that relationships between socioeconomic status and psychiatric illness may rest heavily upon differences between the lowest socioeconomic stratum and the remainder of society. To investigate the extent to which relationships between socioeconomic status and psychiatric illness and disability reflect differences between a deviant lowest socioeconomic stratum and the remainder of society, data from 217 patients hospitalized for psychiatric disorder and reassessed at a 2-year follow-up were examined. At initial assessment, 17 patient characteristics were found to be associated with socioeconomic status; for seven of these 17 characteristics, the largest difference between classes was found between the lowest and the adjacent (next-lowest) social class. At follow-up, for five of 15 characteristics found to be related to social class, the greatest interclass difference occurred between the lowest and the adjacent social class. Both initially and at follow-up, significant associations between patient characteristics and social class remained when the lowest social class patients were excluded from the analyses.\r"

In rats, latent inhibition is disrupted by amphetamine and restored by neuroleptics. It was predicted that latent inhibition would be similarly disrupted in acute schizophrenics (presumably in a hyperdopaminergic state) but not in chronic, medicated schizophrenics. Each group was subdivided and assigned randomly to two experimental conditions, preexposure or non-preexposure. Preexposed subjects first heard 30 bursts of white noise through headphones while monitoring a list of nonsense syllables; non-preexposed subjects listened to the nonsense syllables without the white noise. Subjects in both conditions were then given the opportunity to learn that the noise signalled increments in a visually displayed number. Preexposed normals and chronic schizophrenics learned this association more slowly than non-preexposed subjects (latent inhibition); as predicted, acute schizophrenics failed to display this effect. After 6 to 7 weeks, 11 acute and 13 chronic patients were retested; both groups now showed latent inhibition. These results are discussed in relation to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia.\r"

Denial in alcoholism, as in other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease, may encompass denial of the entire illness or only denial of some aspect, such as the loss of control over alcohol consumption. The Denial Rating Scale (DRS) has been developed to aid in the identification of denial of alcoholism, as well as to help specify which aspect of alcoholism is being denied. The present report describes the DRS and presents early reliability and validity data in support of its use. Preliminary interrater reliability is adequate, and construct and predictive validity appear promising. Several case studies were included to demonstrate the use of the scale.\r"

The reported prevalence of separation anxiety in adolescence was relatively low, but agoraphobics of both sexes reported significantly more separation anxiety than combined simple and social phobics. There were no significant differences between groups for parental losses or severe family disruption during childhood. The results suggest that childhood separation anxiety is a risk factor in females but not in males for the later development of agoraphobia.\r"

Those transvestites who had no homosexual experience were less frequently gender dysphoric but more frequently had a concurrent axis I disorder. The transvestite with recent homosexual experience reported an earlier age when cross-dressing began. These findings are discussed in the context of previous research on transvestism.\r"

A battery containing five creativity measures was administered to a group of college student subjects scoring high on either the Perceptual Aberration Scale or the Magical Ideation Scale (N = 52) and to a group of control subjects (N = 65). A multivariate analysis of variance indicated that subjects high on the schizotypal traits of Perceptual Aberration or Magical Ideation (Per-Mag subjects) differed significantly from control subjects on the five creativity tests. Per-Mag subjects scored significantly higher than control subjects on the Barron-Welsh Revised Art Scale, a measure of preferences for figures, and the How Do You Think, a biographical and personality measure. There was a tendency for female Per-Mag subjects to score higher than female control subjects on the Domino Creativity Scale of the Adjective Check List. Per-Mag and control subjects did not differ on the Gough Creative Personality Scale of the Adjective Check List or on the Alternate Uses test, a test of divergent thinking. Per-Mag subjects who scored above the median for their group and gender on the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale received the highest creativity scores on the Barron-Welsh Revised Art Scale and the How Do You Think, although these results only approached significance. These findings argue for the specificity of areas of similarity and difference in schizotypy and creativity.\r"

Among the nonremitters, we found stable patterns of functioning in the cognitive, coping, personality, interpersonal, and environmental spheres. The destructive nature of these refractory patterns appeared to predispose the individual to a depressionogenic lifestyle. These unchanging features were not found among the remitters. The small size of the remitting group makes our speculations tentative but we did find consistent changes over time across measures of functioning. While the symptom-affective features of the nonremitters remained at clinically significant levels throughout, the depressive symptom levels of the six remitters decreased to nonsignificant clinical levels during the last half of the study. It was noted that, based on these preliminary data, DSM-III-R may be \"underdescriptive\" in regard to relevant symptom features of characterological dysthymia.\r"

The Mini-Mental State (MMS) examination and a number of separate bedside neurobehavioral tests were administered to 206 patients who were consecutively admitted to the University of Iowa Psychiatric Hospital. Both examinations were completed by 150 subjects. Of the sample, 7% had an OMD diagnosis. The most frequent neurological causes of OMD were probable Alzheimer's and closed head trauma. The predictive value positive, predictive value negative, specificity, and sensitivity of the MMS were examined for a number of different cutoff scores. The maximum sensitivity was 75% with a cutoff score of 30. The maximum specificity was 100% with a cutoff of 12. However, only two OMD patients had scores less than 12. There was no cutoff that resulted in a clinically useful screening test. A stepwise multiple logistic regression model using the separately administered bedside tests as independent variables and OMD as the dependent variable resulted in two significant predictors of an OMD diagnosis: the alternating sequence test and a reading test. This model was not appreciably better than the MMS in predicting an OMD diagnosis. A number of problems make the development of a clinically useful cognitive screening test for OMD in inpatients unlikely. These include poor cooperation of the patients, the rarity of OMD in psychiatric inpatients, the heterogeneity of OMD etiologies, and the confounding neuropsychological deficits of a number of common psychiatric disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Reductions in population risk factor levels, including blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and cigarette smoking may be associated with the observed decline in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates. However, few recent population-based comparisons of risk trends are available. To evaluate changes in these risk characteristics in the recent period, data were compared from two surveys performed in the same metropolitan area using similar methods. The Lipid Research Clinic (LRC) Prevalence Study surveyed a population sample of 4185 adults aged 25-59 in 1973-74. The Minnesota Heart Survey (MHS) surveyed a population sample of 2914 adults of the same age in the same metropolitan area in 1980-82. The average systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower in the 1980-82 survey averaging 1.5/3.8 mmHg for men and 1.6/2.8 mmHg for women. The use of anti-hypertensive medications increased significantly over the period while the prevalence of hypertension was similar. Significant declines in mean serum cholesterol were also observed in 1980-82, averaging 3.3 mg/dl for men and 5.5 mg/dl women. The prevalence of regular cigarette smoking in men was also lower in 1980-82, 36.3 vs 42.1% in 1973-74. Women had a lower prevalence of smoking (38.8-35.6%) but the average woman smoker increased consumption of cigarettes while the average man did not. These observations suggest that population risk defined by these characteristics is declining which may explain part of recent Minnesota trends in CVD mortality and could have a favorable effect on future disease patterns.\r"

The subjects were selected in a systematic way from 10,120 male employees in a work-site population in Japan. None of hypertensives took any antihypertensive drugs. Plasma glucose levels at each time point of OGTT were significantly higher in the hypertensives than in the normotensives when the differences in age, obesity, and other factors that might influence glucose metabolism were adjusted, using multiple linear regression analysis. Similarly, multiple regression analysis for subjects including both normotensives and hypertensives revealed a significant relationship between plasma glucose levels and blood pressure, which was independent of age and body mass index. These findings indicate a more direct association between hypertension and hyperglycemia, which is not mediated via aging or obesity.\r"

Using published evidence of its clinical reliability and validity, this article explores whether the Apgar score serves all three measurement purposes equally well. Methodologic guidelines for assessing health indices are applied to examine the structure of the Apgar score as well as its function where performance data are lacking or inadequate. Despite the advent of modern technology, the Apgar score remains the best tool for the identification of newly born infants in need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. For predicting later death or handicap, the Apgar score is insensitive but fairly specific. The ability of the Apgar score to measure change over time has not been studied systematically; however, available data suggest that serial Apgar ratings in infants with early low scores detect clinically important recovery of lack thereof.\r"

We propose that treatment of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia can be studied efficiently using a clinical trial with a two period cross-over design in which placebo and investigational therapy are delivered in random order. A screening phase, dose ranging phase, and both limbs of a cross-over plane can be completed in 180 days or less in each patient.\r"

Compliance was greater than 90% for every patient as assessed by medication diaries kept by each patient's medication partner. There was no treatment effect (bivariate Wilcoxon chi 2 = 0.10, p = 0.95) or treatment-period interaction (chi 2 = 2.87, p = 0.24). However, whichever treatment was received first significantly lowered intraocular pressure (left eye first period X:[ipr50] = 3.0: [-6.0, -1.0] mmHg, right eye = -3.0:[-6.0, -1.0] mmHg, bivariate response chi 2 = 5.92, p = 0.05).

Sibling problem reporting rates, which indicate the likelihood that PWC would have experienced similar problems without a diagnosis of cancer, were highest for physical, emotional, employment, and family problems suggesting that noncancer factors are especially likely to play a role in those types of problems. Regression analyses showed that female and younger PWCs tended to report more problems than their siblings suggesting that they were more affected by cancer and its treatments than were other types of PWC.\r"

In both sexes, subcutaneous (s.c.) fat (assessed by the measurement of s.c. skinfolds) and percent body fat (measured by underwater weighing) were correlated significantly with diastolic (0.27 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 0.37, p less than 0.0005) and systolic (0.17 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 0.29, p less than 0.01) BP. In either sex, the proportion of s.c. trunk fat as reflected by the ratio of trunk/extremity skinfolds showed significant associations with diastolic (men: r = 0.35, women: r = 0.20, p less than 0.01) and systolic BP (men: r = 0.15, women: r = 0.17, p less than 0.05). Control for the effects of covariables potentially affecting BP (energy intake, energy expenditure, maximal oxygen consumption, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake and age) revealed significant effects of age and alcohol intake on BP in men. In women, only age appeared to be associated with BP variation. Partial correlations after control for age and alcohol intake indicated a significant association between the trunk/extremity skinfolds ratio and diastolic BP in men. Such a correlation was not found in women after control for the effect of age. Analysis of variance (2 x 2 factorial with fixed effects) confirmed that, in men, the distribution of s.c. body fat was, per se, associated with diastolic BP (F = 8.43, p less than 0.01), whereas the proportional of s.c. trunk fat was not related to systolic BP in both sexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were eight responses (26%): five surgical complete responses and three surgical partial responses. Responders were patients with stage III ovarian cancer, small residual disease of less than or equal to 1 cm (primarily less than or equal to 5 mm), and patients who previously had responded to cisplatin-based IV chemotherapy. Of the 15 patients with stage III ovarian cancer, residual disease less than or equal to 1 cm, and those who had responded to first-line IV cisplatin-based chemotherapy, 53% (eight) responded to second-line intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

In that study, undertaken in 1973 to evaluate the efficacy of sputum cytology screening, half of the high-risk participants (5,226 men, greater than or equal to 45 years of age, currently smoking greater than or equal to 1 pack of cigarettes per day) were randomly assigned to produce specimens for cytopathological analysis. During regular screenings over the next 5 to 8 years, 626 (12%) showed moderate (or greater) atypia. Sixty-nine of these (26 who progressed to cancer, 43 who did not) were randomly selected for a blinded improved Mab immunostaining protocol in the present study. Satisfactory specimens with morphologic atypia immunostained positively in 14 of the 22 patients who eventually progressed to cancer (sensitivity 64%), and were nonreactive in 35 of the 40 patients who did not progress to lung cancer (specificity 88%). Review of the true positive specimens (14/22 atypias) showed that they were collected 24 months in advance of diagnosis. In contrast, the 8/22 false negative atypias (failure to stain) showed that they were collected for an average of 57 months preceding the diagnosis of cancer. Subsequent specimens (average, 26 months before cancer) from participants who were originally considered \"false negative\" did stain positively improving sensitivity to 91% among specimens collected for an average of 2 years in advance of the clinical appearance of lung cancer. Specificity remained at 88%. Recognition of neoplastic antigen expression 2 years in advance of clinical cancer may be a valuable intermediate end point in studies of lung cancer prevention, detection, and therapy.\r"

It has been our impression that the yield of such examination is low. To test this hypothesis we reviewed all chest radiographs (CXRs) obtained in the above setting in our institution over the last 3 years. These radiographs were independently reviewed by two of us (R.C., J.F.). Sixty-one patients experienced 134 febrile neutropenic episodes for which a CXR was obtained. Only eight (6%) of these films revealed any abnormality. After careful review it was apparent that four of these radiographs did not represent a infectious process. Thus only four of 134 films (2.9%) indicated pulmonary infection as the probable cause of fever in the patient. All four of these patients had prominent respiratory signs or symptoms. Of patients who were febrile but without pulmonary signs/symptoms, only one of 49 had an abnormal radiograph. We feel that such a low yield (at most 2%) calls into question the routine practice of obtaining a CXR in the febrile neutropenic child who is otherwise asymptomatic.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of mediastinal irradiation (RT) following surgery for invasive thymomas, a clinical and pathologic review of 117 patients with the diagnosis of thymoma was completed. Fourteen cases were excluded because of the lack of histologic criteria for a thymic tumor, and the remaining 103 were classified according to a staging system as follows: stage I, completely encapsulated (43); stage II, extension through the capsule or pericapsular fat invasion (21); stage III, invasion of adjacent structures (36); and stage IV, thoracic dissemination or metastases (3). The 5-year actuarial survival and relapse-free survival rates were 67% and 100% for stage I, 86% and 58% for stage II, and 69% and 53% for stage III. No recurrences occurred among stage I patients after total resection without RT. However, eight of 21 patients with invasive (stage II or III) thymomas had mediastinal recurrence as the first site of failure following total resection without RT. The 5-year actuarial mediastinal relapse rate of 53% in this group compares unfavorably with the mediastinal relapse rate seen among stage II or III cases following total resection with RT (0%) or following subtotal resection/biopsy with RT (21%). Despite attempted salvage therapy, five of eight patients with mediastinal relapse following total resection alone died of progressive disease. No significant difference was observed in the local relapse rate, overall relapse rate, or survival between those patients undergoing biopsy and RT v subtotal resection and RT for invasive thymomas (stages II and III). Total resection alone appears to be inadequate therapy resulting in an unacceptably high local failure rate with poor salvage therapy results.\r"

All patients achieved a complete remission after treatment with cisplatin (median dose 583 mg/m2), vinblastine, and bleomycin. None of the patients relapsed during follow-up. During treatment the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased by 18% (P less than .05). During follow-up kidney function recovered in ten patients and partly improved in eight patients. Changes in plasma creatinine did not consistently correspond to alterations in GFR. The mean increase in systolic blood pressure during follow-up did not differ from the increase seen in a group of age-matched healthy men. The mean increase in diastolic pressure, however, was significant (P less than .05), but was entirely due to hypertension observed in six patients. Renography of these patients was normal. We conclude that the decrease in GFR observed during treatment with cisplatin is partly reversible. Cisplatin-treated patients have an increased risk of developing hypertension years after treatment.\r"
