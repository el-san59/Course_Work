  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the minimum oral dosage of bicarbonate needed to significantly elevate blood bicarbonate and the influence of induced alkalosis on performance in high-intensity, short-duration exercise. Nine endurance-trained cyclists performed four 2-min sprints on separate occasions using an isokinetic cycle ergometer (Fitron, Cybex, Inc.). One hour before each test, the cyclists consumed either a placebo (A), a solution of 0.10 g NaHCO3.kg-1 body weight (B), a solution of 0.15 g NaHCO3.kg-1 body weight (C), or a solution of 0.20 g NaHCO3.kg-1 body weight (D) in random order. Arterialized venous blood was taken before (PRE) and after (POST) ingestion, and 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min following the 2-min bike sprint. The results showed a significant increase in POST blood bicarbonate, and the elevation was incrementally related to the dosage. There was, however, no significant improvement in performance. Total work (mean +/- SE) for each treatment (N.m per 2 min) were: A, 47,267 (+/- 2,472); B, 47,004 (+/- 3,094); C, 46,312 (+/- 2,964); and D, 47,190 (+/- 2,621). The results of this study show that incremental doses of NaHCO3 of 0.20 g.kg-1 and below produce incremental elevations in blood bicarbonate but do not produce improvements in performance for a sprint bout lasting 2 min.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine maximal exercise responses during acute and chronic administration of BB. Twenty-eight healthy males, 14 untrained (UT) and 14 involved in a personal training regimen (TR), performed maximal treadmill tests after 1 d and 9 d under three double-blind, randomized conditions: a placebo (PLAC), propranolol (PROP) 80 mg b.i.d., and atenolol (ATEN) 100 mg o.d. Maximal heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation (VE), and treadmill time were significantly reduced by PROP and ATEN after an acute and chronic dose when compared to PLAC (P less than 0.05) in both groups of subjects. Maximal HR was decreased more after 1 d of BB than after 9 d of BB with both PROP and ATEN in the UT subjects and with PROP only in the TR group. VO2max, VEmax, and treadmill time were also less attenuated after 9 d of BB; however, this trend did not reach statistical significance. The nonselective beta blocker, PROP, caused greater reductions in VO2max compared to the selective beta blocker, ATEN, in both groups of subjects. These data indicate that, other than a small change in maximal HR, there is no difference in the exercise response to acute and chronic BB in normal and highly conditioned individuals.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis of this study was that non-exercise variables can be used to reliably predict peak oxygen consumption (VO2) in patients with obstructive airway disease (OAD). We also evaluated the impact of symptoms on exercise capacity. Selected predictor variables included age, lung function, respiratory muscle strength, gas exchange, and the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). In 40 patients peak VO2 was 19.9 +/- 8.7 (mean +/- SD) ml.kg-1.min-1 during progressive, incremental exercise until limited by symptoms on a cycle ergometer. Multiple regression analysis yielded three significant predictors: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), age, and BDI. Peak VO2 (ml.kg-1.min-1) = 5.5 (FEV1) - 0.3 (age) + 0.8 (BDI) + 19.3 (R2 = 0.79; SEE: 4.2 ml.kg-1.min-1). Comparisons between patients who stopped exercise because of breathlessness (N = 14) and those who stopped because of leg fatigue (N = 18) showed that lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, and peak VO2 were significantly reduced in the former group compared to the latter. Peak exercise ventilation (VE)/MVV ratio was similar in the breathless (95.3 +/- 23.8%) and leg fatigue (86.8 +/- 20.3) groups, but peak heart rate (HR)/pred. HRmax ratio was significantly higher in the leg fatigue group (86.8 +/- 12.6%) than in the breathless group (75.1 +/- 8.6%) (P = 0.006). We conclude that lung function, age, and the clinical rating of breathlessness reliably predict peak VO2 in patients with symptomatic OAD. Moreover, peak exercise performance in OAD appears to be affected by different physiological factors which may be distinguished by the major symptom limiting exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the potent opioid, sufentanil, were studied in 11 athletes. Sufentanil was administered intravenously (up to 0.5 microgram.kg-1 over 10 min) to the subjects while they ran at 14 km.hr-1 on a level treadmill. Prior to, and after, the drug infusion, the treadmill was inclined by 6% for 4 min and CO2 was inhaled for 4 min. Two groups were studied: group 1 (six subjects) breathed room air and group 2 (five subjects) breathed O2 enriched air. During level running the ventilation (liters.min-1) of the group 1 subjects was reduced (65.3 +/- 8.6 to 55.9 +/- 4.9, P = 0.09, mean +/- standard error) and PaCO2 (mm Hg) increased from 37.6 +/- 0.7 to 44.0 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.05). PaO2 (mm Hg) was substantially reduced from 92.0 +/- 2.0 to 70.0 +/- 2.0 (P less than 0.05). In group 2, where hypoxia did not occur, ventilation was reduced from 62.5 +/- 1.5 to 47.6 +/- 1.0 (P less than 0.05). The ventilatory response to the CO2 was shifted to the right but the slope was unchanged by sufentanil. The 6% grade did not cause any significant change in the PaCO2 in either group 1 (0.1 +/- 0.4 prior and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm Hg increase after sufentanil) or group 2 (1.0 +/- 1.5 prior and 0.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg increase after sufentanil). The heart rate response was unaffected by sufentanil but the blood pressure increase in response to the 6% grade was blocked with the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Maximal voluntary strength of the trunk muscles was measured in 57 male elite athletes (soccer players, wrestlers, tennis players, and gymnasts), 14 female elite gymnasts, and in a normal group of 87 conscripts. Mean ages in the different groups ranged from 18-22 yr. An isokinetic (constant velocity) technique was used to record maximal torque produced by trunk and hip muscles during flexion, extension, and lateral flexion over the range of motion. The constant angular velocities used were 15 deg.s-1 and 30 deg.s-1, respectively. Isometric strength was measured in a straight body position (0 deg. of flexion). The measurements were made with the subjects in a horizontal position with the pivot point at the hip and at the lumbar (L2-L3) level. All male athlete groups showed higher peak torque values than the normals. The differences were largest in hip extension and trunk flexion. The male gymnasts also showed significantly higher peak values in hip flexion as compared to all other categories. There was no difference in strength per kg body weight between female gymnasts and untrained males, except in trunk extension. The position for peak torque occurred earlier in the movements for the athletes, especially for the gymnasts in extension movements and for the tennis players in flexion movements. In isometric contractions essentially the same strength differences were present as in the slow isokinetic contractions. In lateral flexion wrestlers and tennis players showed significantly higher strength in movements toward the nondominant side. Thus, differences were present between the athletes and the normals, some of which appeared to be sport specific and related to long-term systematic training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Failure to demonstrate a \"significant\" relationship may be due to two factors: 1) the variables are truly unrelated, or 2) a relationship exists but goes undetected due to inadequate statistical power. Investigators must consider the second possibility since failure to detect a statistically significant relationship is often taken as evidence for no biological relationship. These issues are addressed in the context of the interrelationship between four features common to all statistical methods: the size of effect or relationship worth detecting, the Type I (alpha) error, the sample size, and the Type II (beta) error. An example derived from published data relating morphological characteristics of muscle fiber type and isokinetic strength performance illustrates the practical significance of this dilemma.\r"

Subjects with an excessive overuse exhibited almost only type 1 muscle fibers and with marked hypertrophy. Subjects who did not use remaining TA fibers because of too-severe paralysis had a normal fiber type differentiation and fiber atrophy. The use of remaining TA motor units was correlated to the type 1 muscle fiber percentage (r = 0.69) and to the type 1 fiber size (r = 0.78). Identical changes were observed in subjects with prior poliomyelitis and in subjects with prior LV lesion and were, thus, not specific for poliomyelitis. The changes in fiber type composition may be explained by a transition of type 2 to type 1 muscle fibers in accordance with previously reported experimental transneuronal stimulation through implanted electrodes in animals.\r"

  ".W": "The specific binding of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to cells and its subsequent uptake into these cells is well documented, but little is known of the LDL binding and uptake by skeletal muscle. Lipoproteins are the major transporters of tocopherols, deficiencies of which have been associated with a number of muscle diseases of animals. Their possible implication in human muscle diseases prompted our investigation of LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) binding and uptake into human muscle cells in culture. Cultured human muscle cells were used at both the myoblast and myotube stage. They were incubated with LDL or HDL which were labelled by protein iodination or with (3H) alpha-tocopherol and receptor binding and cell uptake characteristics established. LDL binds to both myoblasts and myotubes, but the binding affinity increases significantly with the more highly differentiated cells. This binding appears to be specific to LDL receptors. The LDL is taken into the muscle cell and protein is degraded, as with other types of cells. HDL also binds to muscle cells, but there is no evidence of internalization. alpha-Tocopherol is transferred to muscle cells from both LDL and HDL, but the transfer is not dependent on lipoprotein internalization. HDL is effective as a means of transport of alpha-tocopherol to muscle cells, but LDL appears to be about one order more effective.\r"

  ".W": "Protein compositional and functional differences exist between longitudinal and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in relation to Ca transport and to Ca release. In light of this knowledge, we have reinvestigated the effects of denervation on SR of rabbit gastrocnemius, a predominantly fast muscle. Electron microscopy of 2-weeks denervated muscle showed proliferation of transverse tubules (TT), forming junctional contacts with SR terminal cisternae (TC). At coincident periods, the yield of muscle microsomes was increased, and their fractionation by sucrose-density centrifugation demonstrated a relative increase of heavy vesicles. Thin-section electron microscopy of heavy SR from denervated muscle showed an increased number of vesicles containing calsequestrin (CS) as compared with control muscle. Electrophoretic analysis confirmed the relative decrease of Ca-ATPase protein and the striking increase of CS both in total microsomes and in heavy SR vesicles. Calcium loading and Ca-ATPase activity as well as the density of Ca-ATPase protein were decreased to a similar extent (20-30%) in denervated muscle microsomes. Stimulation of Ca-ATPase activity by Ca-ionophore A23187 showed that the vesicles were tightly sealed. When probed by competitive ELISA with antibody to SR Ca-ATPase from pure fast muscle, the Ca-ATPase of denervated microsomes was found to be highly cross reactive. Cleveland's peptide maps of the Ca-ATPase protein after partial digestion with S. aureus V8 protease also showed no significant change after denervation. Changes in cholesterol content and in the ratio of Mg-ATPase to Ca-ATPase activity of denervated muscle microsomes indicated a 4-fold increase of TT protein, i.e., from about 3% to not more than 12% of total protein, at 2 weeks after denervation. All these changes were totally reversed upon reinnervation of muscle fibers, and the consequent muscle recovery, as obtained by nerve crushing instead of nerve sectioning. From these results, we conclude that denervated adult fast muscle, similarly to immature fast muscle, contains more junctional SR. However, the molecular and catalytic properties of the Ca-ATPase are unaffected by denervation.\r"

During isometric muscle work induced by indirect electrical stimulation, and subsequent recovery, changes in the ratio of phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphates (Pi) were comparable in muscle of PFK-deficient and normal dogs and indicated a large capacity for arobic oxidative phosphorylation in canine muscle. The progressive accumulation of sugar phosphates (PME) during graded exercise clearly demonstrated the glycolytic block in PFK-deficient dogs. During a muscle contracture, induced by acute muscle stimulation, PFK-deficient muscle became completely depleted of PCr and ATP, accumulated large amounts of PME, and recovered very slowly. We conclude that PFK-deficient dogs have a metabolic myopathy that demonstrated some but not all the features recognized in the human disorder.\r"

Post-mortem brain tissue specimens were obtained from 19 patients 15 of whom had had cancer. With a few exceptions, all cancer patients had been treated with opiates during the terminal stage of their life. The glucuronide formation of morphine and naloxone was studied in vitro after incubation of the brain microsomal fraction with the substrate and uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid (UDPGA). The glucuronides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Glucuronidation of morphine and naloxone was catalyzed in 6 of the 19 investigated tissue specimens. The rate of formation of naloxone-3-glucuronide (N3G) exceeded that of the morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G). Morphine-6-glucuronide formation was found in only 2 specimens, in which the formation rate was 10% of the formation rate of M3G. When morphine and naloxone were present simultaneously at equal concentrations (3 mM), the N3G/M3G formation rate ratio increased compared to that when the 2 substrates were incubated one by one. Our findings are interesting from a clinical point of view since the pathways studied represent both bioactivation and inactivation steps in the metabolism of opioids.\r"

The present study was designed to test a cognitive-behavioral mediation model of pain and depression that proposes perceived reduction in instrumental activities along with a decline in perceptions of control and personal mastery are necessary prerequisites for the development of depressive symptomatology in pain patients. According to this model, in contrast to alternative models, the presence of pain is not sufficient condition for the subsequent development of depression. This model was tested and confirmed through the application of structural modeling with latent variables. Specifically, the direct link between pain and depression was found to be non-significant, however, measures of perceived life interference and self-control were found to be significant intervening variables between pain and depression. These results provide the first empirical demonstration that psychological mediators may be involved in the development of depression secondary to chronic pain. The findings of this study are contrasted with single-factor models that postulate both chronic pain and depression as resulting from a common cause.\r"

Inferences are made about the 'psychological content' of the patient's pain on the basis of the extent and distribution of the pain as illustrated in these drawings. In this study, the records of 328 patients from 4 distinct types of chronic pain service, were scored for how many body parts were included in the pain drawings and the percentage of body surface area involved. Four psychological instruments were used to quantify the psychological status of the patients. These included 2 measures of current psychological status (the General Health Questionnaire-28, and the Irritability/Depression and Anxiety Questionnaire), 1 measure of childhood quality (the Parental Bonding Index), and 1 measure of premorbid personality (the Hysteroid/Obsessoid Questionnaire). No significant correlation was found between the percentage of body surface area affected by pain, and the measures of childhood quality. Only very limited correlations were found between the percentage of the body surface area with pain and the measures of current psychological state and premorbid personality. Hence, strong emphasis should not be placed on the involvement of multiple areas as a sign of psychological illness.\r"

  ".W": "Although behavioral scientists have long been interested in how an individual's locus of control relates to coping and adjustment, basic information remains to be gathered on the relevance of locus of control to adaptation to persistent pain. This study examined the relationship of locus of control orientation to pain coping strategies and psychological distress in chronic pain patients. Subjects were 62 chronic pain patients. All patients were administered: (1) the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scales to assess locus of control, (2) the Coping Strategies Questionnaire to evaluate pain coping strategies, and (3) the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised to assess psychological distress. Correlational analyses revealed that patients who viewed outcomes as controlled by chance factors such as fate or luck tended to rely on maladaptive pain coping strategies and rated their abilities to control and decrease pain as poor. They also exhibited greater psychological distress. Regression analyses indicated that patients having a chance orientation toward locus of control were more likely to report depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and to have higher overall levels of psychological distress. Chance locus of control also predicted greater reliance on diverting attention and praying/hoping in dealing with their pain. In addition, patients high on chance locus of control reported feeling helpless to deal effectively with their pain problem. Clinicians evaluating chronic pain patients need to be aware that patients who view outcomes as controlled by external factors such as chance may have deficits in pain coping strategies and may report greater psychological distress than patients who do not have this locus of control orientation.\r"

Evaluation included the Illness Self-Concept Repertory Grid (ISCRG) and follow-up was at 1 and 6 months post treatment. Consensus grids indicated the subjects initially identified with physical illness but this association decreased over the course of the study. There appeared, therefore, to be a shift in self-concept away from physical illness, in association with the learning and practice of self-hypnosis. This change was especially evident in the grids of those subjects who experienced the most pain relief. An association between pain reduction and self-concepts is thus noted. This study does not identify whether self-concepts merely reflect therapeutic change or whether strong self-identification with physical illness indicates a poor prognosis for pain relief. This is a question which deserves further study.\r"

Relying on next-of-kin to provide information about the patient's pain could help, but little has been done to verify next-of-kin responses with respect to subjective experiences. For the present study 42 pairs of cancer patients and their next-of-kin were independently surveyed in 1982 in Washington state regarding their cancer pain and various aspects of medical treatment to determine whether proxies can give reliable responses. Close agreement between subject and next-of-kin was observed for the items which were salient and had a limited choice of responses, such as the presence of pain. Agreement in the aggregate was achieved for the items having several possible responses, such as the intensity and frequency of pain. Correspondence was virtually random for those items which had a variety of listed responses. The use of proxies in obtaining information, future research directions, and difficulties with measuring agreement are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "An unbiased preference conditioning procedure was used to characterize and compare the motivational effects of opioids in naive rats and those suffering from the prolonged pain associated with Freund's adjuvant (FA)-induced inflammation of one hind limb. The mu-opioid agonist morphine functioned as a reinforcer in naive animals, producing marked preferences for the drug-paired place. Similarly, rats injected with FA 7 days prior to conditioning exhibited a preference for the morphine place, and the magnitude of this effect did not differ between groups. Administration of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U-69593 to naive rats produced dose-related place aversions. The aversive effect of this kappa-agonist was, however, abolished in FA-treated rats. Thus, regardless of the dose administered, U-69593 produced conditioning similar to that observed in response to saline. These data suggest that kappa-agonists may lack aversive effects in subjects experiencing prolonged noxious stimulation, and as such may be effective therapeutic agents in the management of chronic pain states.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of tizanidine, a new muscle relaxant, 5-chloro-4-(2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino)-2,1,3-benzothiazole (DS 103-282) were studied on the activity of lumbar dorsal horn convergent neurons in anaesthetized paralysed rats. Following i.v. administration of tizanidine both the A- and C-fibre evoked responses were depressed in a dose-dependent manner in the 0.125-1.0 mg/kg range. The smaller dose employed (0.125 mg/kg) induced a significant depression of the C-fibre evoked responses (39.6 +/- 13.4% of the control responses) and a total recovery was observed 10 min after the injection: when the doses were increased, stronger and longer-lasting depressant effects were obtained. Identical but less powerful effects were observed on A-fibre responses. None of the depressive effects was correlated with variations in blood pressure. Microelectrophoretically applied tizanidine was found to depress current-dependently, the discharges of convergent neurones evoked by microelectrophoretically applied DL-homocysteic acid. In contrast, tizanidine (0.5, 1 mg/kg; i.v.) was found to be ineffective against the activities of non-nociceptive neurones triggered by mechanical stimulation of their receptive fields. It is concluded that tizanidine depresses specifically the activities of dorsal horn convergent neurones, probably in part by a post-synaptic inhibitory action. Owing to the role of convergent neurones in pain processes, the present result could explain, at least partially, the analgesic action of this compound.\r"

This paper demonstrates a cortical influence upon the medial thalamic nuclei unit activity evoked by thermal noxious stimulation in rats. We studied the effects of cortical spreading depression (CSD) upon the responses of the centralis lateralis (CL) nucleus of the medial thalamus to noxious heat stimulation. Urethane was used as anaesthetic. Cells responding to noxious stimulation were localized in the dorsal portion of the CL. These cells responded like polymodal or nociceptive specific units in the spinal cord and exhibited their highest discharge frequency with noxious stimuli. When CSD is propagated and affects the medial frontal cortex it blocks the responses evoked in CL cells by noxious stimulation. Cortical cells located at this level also exhibited responses evoked by noxious stimulation. Our results suggest a cortical facilitatory control upon the noxious responses recorded in the CL cells.\r"

Training conditions were changed randomly from trial to trial over 300 trials. All subjects achieved control on both behavior patterns resulting in a simultaneous modification of the size of this complex according to the training conditions. Furthermore, the individual pain report measured with a visual analogue scale was altered in accordance with the biofeedback-induced behavioral modifications. A decrease in subjective pain report was achieved after down-training while an increase was observed after the up-training.\r"

Histological examination and x ray probe microanalysis showed a greater intercellular concentration of lanthanum in the tracheal epithelium in sensitised than in control animals.

The difference between exercise tolerance at best and exercise tolerance at worst (variation in exercise tolerance) was expressed on a scale ranging from 0 (no variation) to 6 (greatest variation). The effectiveness of these questions has been assessed in 68 patients with airflow limitation attending a chest clinic, by comparing the results with variation in peak expiratory flow rate (PEF). Variation in PEF was expressed as the standard deviation of the first 24 PEF recordings from each patient (equivalent to four days' recordings). There was a highly significant relation between the measure of variation in exercise tolerance obtained from the questionnaire and PEF variation, though each point on the scale of variation in exercise tolerance covered a wide range of variation in PEF. The questions give some guide to the variation in airflow limitation and in combination with other questions may be helpful in epidemiological studies.\r"

Portable oxygen (41 min-1) carried by the patient increased the mean endurance walking time by 59% and the six minute walking distance by 17%. The endurance time for cycling at a constant work load was increased by 51% with oxygen at a flow rate of 21 min-1, by 88% at 41 min-1, and by 80% at 61 min-1. Supplemental oxygen prolonged the length of time that the patients were able to walk at a fixed speed. It also increased the mean speed achieved during a six minute walk but this was variable and did not occur in all the subjects. The benefit from supplemental oxygen was not cancelled by the effort of carrying the portable cylinder.\r"

  ".W": "Disorders of haemostasis and altered platelet activity have been documented in patients with malignant disease but their relation to response to treatment and prognosis are not known. Thrombin activity (fibrinopeptide A (FpA), plasmin mediated fibrinolysis (B beta 15-42) antigen), and platelet alpha granule release (beta thromboglobulin) were studied in 37 patients with small cell lung cancer to find out whether these indices show a relationship to chemoresponse. There was evidence of considerably increased thrombin activity, with a median fibrinopeptide A concentration of 13.2 (normal less than 4) pmol/ml, but only modestly increased fibrinolysis, with a median B beta 14-42 antigen concentration of 5.6 (normal less than 3) pmol/ml. Thus the ratio of fibrinopeptide A to B beta 15-42 concentration (FpA:B beta) was raised, with a median value of 2.2 (normal less than 1.33). In addition, 57% of patients had increased platelet alpha granule release, the median beta thromboglobulin concentration being 50 (normal less than 50) ng/ml. There was a significant association between increased thrombin generation and lack of response to chemotherapy. Furthermore, non-responders had higher FpA:B beta ratios. The same haemostatic markers were studied in nine patients who have been in complete remission for at least two years after chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer. There was a significant difference in thrombin activity and also in the ratio of thrombin activity to lysis between the pretreatment group and the group of two year survivors. Lack of response to chemotherapy appears to be related to increased thrombin activity. Such an association has not previously been reported in patients with malignant disease.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of breathing pattern on lung deposition and bronchodilator response to nebulised salbutamol is uncertain. Three different breathing patterns were assessed in eight patients with chronic stable asthma. Salbutamol solution (2.5 mg in 4 ml) mixed with technetium-99m labelled human serum albumin was nebulised by an Acorn nebuliser at a flow rate of 6 litres a minute. Particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 4.8 microns were produced for inhalation by (a) tidal breathing, (b) six tidal breaths followed by three deep breaths, and (c) six tidal breaths followed by three deep breaths with a five second breath hold after each breath. Each breathing pattern was continued for four minutes. There was no significant difference in the percentage of radioaerosol deposited in the lung or in the distribution of radioaerosol within the lung as assessed by gamma camera imaging. Changes in bronchodilator responses as measured by peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC) 30, 45, and 60 minutes after inhalation were similar for the three studies. The mean (SEM) maximum percentage change in FEV1 was 44 (7.1), 47 (9.2), and 51 (8.4) for studies 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The percentage of nebulised solution deposited in the body was also similar for the three breathing patterns--that is, 11-13%, of which 98% entered the lung. This study shows that inhaling a nebulised aerosol by tidal breathing, the simplest method, is as effective as tidal breathing with deep breaths with or without a breath hold.\r"

Open intubation drainage of the bullae was used in all patients, the technique initially devised by Monaldi for the treatment of intrapulmonary tuberculous abscesses having been modified. Three patients died after surgery. Mortality was associated with low preoperative FEV1 (median 350 ml) and higher preoperative arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) (median 7.8 kPa). Symptomatic improvement was reported by 16 of the remaining 17 patients and was maintained over a median follow up period of 1.6 years. This was accompanied by objective improvement in lung function with a 22% median improvement in FEV1, an 11% median reduction in total lung capacity, and a 26% median reduction in residual volume. In one patient symptoms were unchanged after surgery. The technique described provides a simple method for decompressing bullae by means of a minimally invasive surgical procedure. It also allows for the treatment of further bullae at a later date by closed intubation under local anaesthetic. It has proved a suitable approach for all but those with the poorest lung function and is now our treatment of choice.\r"

This paper analyzes the interaction patterns that complicated the research enterprise, particularly the triangles among the research team, the nurses, and the physicians. It also describes steps taken by the research team to deal with these ecological/systems problems. The authors raise these issues to help other researchers who encounter similar problems in community-based research, problems which are rarely discussed in the research literature.\r"

A majority of the patients at the four settings indicated that they had no preference regarding attire (70.5% for male doctors, 66.5% for female doctors): however, 44% of the patients said that neatness of dress was moderately to very important. The aggregate findings were not greatly altered when adjusted for demographic variables such as age, sex, race, occupational status, and education.\r"

Recent literature has indicated these needs to be in the areas of increased research, improved clinical skills, reassessment of content and methods of faculty development, and changes in educational methods. To identify the status of faculty development programs in 1985, 126 family medicine university-based programs were surveyed. Data were obtained regarding the content of faculty development programs, the perceived competence of faculty in six clinical teaching areas and three academic areas, and the importance of eight areas of faculty development. The most frequent activity reported by the 74 respondents was in the area of teaching and evaluation. Research was the academic area listed in which directors noted a particular lack of competence. In the clinical content area, both procedural skills and critical care stood out as areas of faculty needs. Results suggested that more than one track of faculty development should be provided to meet complex and changing faculty development needs.\r"

In men and women aged 30-59, the proportion with high LTPA increased from 1972 to 1982 by approximately one half (p less than 0.001), whereas that of high OPA decreased during the same period (p less than 0.001). In both sexes, high overall physical activity fell from 1972 to 1977 (p less than 0.001), but no more from 1977 to 1982. The proportion of entirely sedentary remained stable. Education, income and younger age showed a positive, body mass index, smoking and OPA a graded, negative association with high LTPA in 1972 and 1982. Significant (p less than 0.001) differences in 10-year trends of changes in LTPA were observed: men and women with low education or income increased LTPA more than those with high education and income. Socioeconomic factors, such as income and education, appear to have lost importance as determinants of population-wide exercise, whereas the clustering of low physical activity with overweight and smoking has increased.\r"

Three groups of men were included: men with clinically manifest IHD, men with risk factors and healthy men. Psychosocial factors were assessed by means of standardized questionnaires. They comprised educational level, social class, marital status and a comprehensive assessment of the daily rounds of life of these men. Furthermore, a subjective rating of the own general health status was obtained. The clinical investigation included a standard physical examination, fasting serum lipids, glucose and urate, a frontal and sagittal chest X-ray and a 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. During follow-up 37 men died, 20 of them from IHD. Non-survivors were discriminated from survivors by the following factors: older age, lower education, lower social class, higher systolic blood pressure, increased ventricular irritability and cardiac enlargement. Furthermore, a relative social isolation as indicated by a low social activity level and a poor self-rated general health status was characteristic of non-survivors. In multivariate analyses three factors emerged as the equally strong predictors of mortality, both from all causes and from IHD: social isolation, a poor self-rated health status and ventricular irritability. The psychosocial mortality predictors were independent of and of similar strength as the clinical predictors.\r"

On admission to hospital, two or more indicators showed subnormal values for 16%; this was associated with the female sex, high age and a history of atrial fibrillation. At discharge, 22% had two or more subnormal indicators. Poor nutritional status during the hospital stay appeared to be related to infections, the male sex, the intake of cardiovascular drugs and high age. Fewer of the patients with two or more subnormal nutritional indicators were able to return home than of the patients with none or one subnormal nutritional indicator. We conclude that undernutrition is not uncommon at the onset of stroke and that certain risk groups for the development of undernutrition during hospital stay can be identified.\r"

No significant correlations could be seen within the AMI group between the decrease in filterability and the levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase or serum lactate dehydrogenase. The erythrocyte filterability, however, correlated to the serum concentrations of hepatic enzymes in AMI. The addition of sodium lactate in vitro in physiological concentrations (0.9-3.6 mM/l final concentration) lowered the erythrocyte filterability markedly to 2.7 (0-9.8) units in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the hypothesis that the decrease in erythrocyte filterability in AMI might be caused by an increase in the lactate concentration.\r"

Thus, digitized M-mode echocardiograms were obtained in 32 (18 men) young (less than 50 years) normotensive controls and 32 (21 men) long-term (greater than or equal to 12 years) type I diabetics with blood pressures ranging from normal to hypertensive. All diabetics were without clinical heart disease, none were previously treated for hypertension or using cardioactive drugs. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher in diabetic than control subjects. Their LV end-diastolic dimension was smaller, whereas wall thickness, LV mass index and fractional shortening were similar to controls. In diabetics, however, the normalized peak filling rate was decreased and the rapid filling period fraction of diastole increased. In multivariate analysis, diabetes and LV mass independently and inversely influenced the normalized peak filling rate, while fractional shortening did so positively. Furthermore, diabetes and systolic blood pressure independently influenced the rapid filling period fraction of diastole. This study is the first to demonstrate systolic blood pressure and LV mass as independent contributors to subclinical LV diastolic abnormalities in diabetics. These findings may therefore indicate the need to treat even mild hypertension in diabetics in an effort to delay the development of cardiopathy.\r"

  ".W": "D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product containing the gamma-gamma crosslink of fibrin, can now be assayed by the use of highly specific monoclonal antibodies. Such assays are not influenced by fibrinogenolysis and measurements can be performed on citrated plasma. The diagnostic values of four such assays--two based on ELISA technique and two on latex agglutination--were evaluated in 108 out of 118 consecutive patients admitted with suspected deep venous thrombosis of the leg. With cut-off limits defined by a pilot study and with venography as reference, a negative D-dimer test was confirmed in 45 of 46 patients (98%; 95% confidence limits: 88-99.9%) after ELISA-M, in 43 of 44 (98%; 88-99.9%) after ELISA-S, in 54 of 67 (81%; 69-89%) after Latex-M and in 40 of 44 (91%; 78-97%) after Latex-S. A positive D-dimer test was confirmed in 61% (48-73%), 59% (46-71%), 63% (47-78%), and 55% (42-67%) respectively. These data suggest the use of one of the ELISA assays for screening. A negative D-dimer test excludes deep venous thrombosis, whereas a positive D-dimer should be followed by venography. By this procedure a 40% reduction of venographic examinations can be expected.\r"

Homicidal burning also has occurred in civil unrest situations. Infanticide was rarely encountered. Alcohol was detected in the homicide victims in 62.9% of cases; 8.4% had a blood alcohol concentration higher than 0.30 g/100 ml. Our figures confirm that Cape Town has one of the highest homicide rates in the world (56.9/100,000 per annum for 1986). Homicides in Cape Town are characterized by assaults with sharp instruments, usually knives, although \"pangas,\" or cane knives, are also commonly used.\r"

The higher the serum alcohol concentration (SAC), the greater were the odds that death was due to external (traumatic) causes. We identified 149 medical examiner cases that were positive for ethanol and negative for 11 major drug of abuse groups, and studied those cases to further clarify ethanol-related risk factors and behaviors. Based on terms of frequency of occurrence, the data identify SACs of 201 mg% to 300 mg% as a particularly high risk factor for sudden, unexpected, traumatic death. Traumatic deaths associated with SACs below 100 mg% were infrequent, and attendant opinions concerning the contributory role of ethanol must be made with circumspection. SACs below 150 mg% could not be used to predict whether or not the decedents had been engaged in active or sedentary behavior prior to death because both situations occurred with equal frequency. At SACs between 151 mg% and 350 mg%, active situations were observed three times as often as sedentary situations. When SACs were 350 mg%, sedentary situations were observed twice as often as active situations. Suicide victims and driver fatalities rarely showed SACs above 350 mg%; therefore finding such SACs in apparent suicidal or driver fatality situations should prompt a thorough investigation to rule out other possibilities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Clinical evaluation of knee instability is often difficult to reproduce, and several different physical tests have become popular. In an attempt to elucidate reasons for variations in the degree of pivot shift phenomenon seen with the use of the various tests, we have prospectively evaluated a group of 37 patients with surgically documented ACL injuries, noting the effects of hip position and tibial rotation. The patients were examined under anesthesia, and the pivot shift was graded as 0 (absent, or negative), 0.5+ (trace), 1+, 2+, or 3+ (with locking). All knees were tested in hip abduction, neutral, and hip adduction, and with the tibia in external and internal rotation, so that six positions were evaluated. Hip position strongly correlated with the degree of pivot shift regardless of tibial rotation. Overall, abduction produced the greatest degree of pivot shift, followed by neutral and finally adduction. External tibial rotation increased the pivot shift score in abduction and neutral, but not in adduction. A grading system for the subject population showed that abduction/external rotation (ABDER) resulted in the highest pivot shift scores, and that adduction/external rotation (ADDER) and adduction/internal rotation (ADDIR) resulted in the lowest scores. Nine patients out of 20 with a 3+ pivot shift in ABDER were negative in ADDER. The pivot shift score was dampened at least one grade from ABDER to ADDER in 92% of the patients. We conclude that hip position and tibial rotation affect the degree of pivot shift phenomenon, and it is our impression that the iliotibial band plays a significant role in controlling the degree of pivot shift observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Position players demonstrated 8 degrees more external rotation in abduction, 14 degrees less horizontal extension, and 8 degrees less elbow extension on the dominant side compared with their nondominant side. Greater torque was produced by pitchers compared with position players for the dominant and nondominant arm at all test speeds for both mean peak and mean average torque. Greater torque was produced by the dominant arm compared with the nondominant arm also at all test speeds for both of these measurements. No difference was found between the rotation ratios for either arm, for either group, for all speeds.\r"

The workload was predetermined, and the exercise was performed for 20 minutes on a bicycle ergometer. Both the control and ACL deficient knees demonstrated significantly increased averaged laxity after exercise. The percentage increase was less in the ACL deficient knees than in the control knees; the difference was not statistically significant. Nor was there a significant sex effect. We believe that an ACL stress test would be useful to predict which patients with documented knee instability would consequently be \"at risk\" of suffering disability during activity. Further investigation should be carried out to establish a stress test that would accurately define a threshold for ACL disability and indicate the need for early reconstruction in those patients at risk.\r"

Acute and chronic diagnostic quantitation of compartment pressures are a valuable adjunct to clinical diagnosis, particularly when used to evaluate the athlete with exercise-induced pain. This study evaluated a prototype hand-held, digital, fluid pressure monitor used for the measurement of compartment pressure in the exercising athlete. A laboratory water and mercury manometer study, in which 50 paired, single-blind measurements were taken, revealed that the digital monitor was accurate to +/- 0.8 mm Hg (SD) of actual pressure with no individual reading more than 1 mm Hg from the actual pressure when compared directly with a mercury and a water column. Laboratory study of bovine muscle placed within a pressure chamber revealed that the digital monitor, when assembled in the same manner as used for clinical measurement, was accurate to +/- 0.9 mm Hg. The needle manometer technique was also found to be accurate to +/- 3 mm Hg from actual pressure. Twenty-one paired measurements of the anterolateral and posterior compartments of the hindlimbs of eight anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits by both the needle manometer and digital monitor methods by two examiners demonstrated the digital monitor to be reproducible to +/- 1.0 mm Hg [Coefficient of variation (CV) less than 7%] and needle manometer method to +/- 3.4 mm Hg (CV less than 16%) with r = 0.94.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bed rest is a model commonly used to simulate space flight. The changes in muscle area and strength of the calf dorsiflexors and plantar flexors were measured before and after bed rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a Cybex II dynamometer. The muscle area of the plantar flexors (gastrocnemius and soleus) decreased 12%, whereas the muscle area of the dorsiflexors was not significantly decreased. The maximal muscle strength of the plantar flexors decreased 26%; the muscle strength of the dorsiflexors was not significantly decreased. These results, which demonstrate differential muscle atrophy and a larger loss in strength relative to muscle area, have important implications in the development of exercise counter-measures to be implemented during space flight. The results also have implications for patients who have severe orthopaedic disorders and must be bed rested for long periods of time, and for persons who are voluntarily inactive (a large number of the elderly).\r"

By using fresh cadaver knees, the authors hoped to define the relationship of the posterior joint capsule and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL, LCL) with posterior knee instability in the PCL deficient knee. Thirty newtons of posterior stress were applied to the knees to simulate postoperative conditions. Roentgenographic methods were then used to evaluate posterior sag and change in the distance between the origin and insertion of the PCL. Strain gauges were used to measure the actual strain of the PCL and the collateral ligaments. The PCL, the posterior capsule, and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were sequentially divided and the above measurements were then repeated in the same way, using 30 N of applied posterior stress. When only the PCL was cut, posterior sag and medial rotation of the tibia occurred with increasing severity as flexion increased. No sagging or rotation of the tibia was observed at full extension in the knees that had isolated PCL \"injury\". When the posterior capsule was sectioned, no significant changes were noted in the severity of the sag or the rotation. When the MCL or LCL was divided in a PCL deficient knee, greater sag occurred with flexion and a significant sag was observed even at full extension. The MCL \"injury\" was associated with increased medial rotation, whereas LCL \"injuries\" were associated with lateral rotation of the tibia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 400 and 500 g were used to evaluate the effect of the NSAID piroxicam on the healing of an experimental injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL). The following factors were varied in the experiments: dosage, days of treatment, and the day postinjury when treatment was begun. Piroxicam-treated rats were compared to placebo-treated rats in terms of the drug's effect on the mechanical strength of the healing ligament. The ligaments were mechanically tested in tension to failure at a constant deformation rate of 0.25 mm/sec on a materials testing machine. Administration of piroxicam on Days 1 to 6 postinjury resulted in a 42% increase in strength at Day 14 postinjury for the piroxicam-treated ligaments (P less than 0.01) when compared with the placebo-treated controls. Neither doubling nor halving the standard piroxicam dose significantly altered this increased healing strength. Biochemical analysis of collagen synthesis demonstrated a suggestive, although not statistically significant, increase in collagen synthesis and collagen content in the piroxicam-treated healing ligament. In separate experiments, piroxicam had no effect on the healed ligament at 21 days or on the strength of uninjured ligaments. In conclusion, piroxicam increased the early strength of healing ligaments in the rat when the drug was administered for short periods of time after injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In bandy, where facial protection was inadequate during the time of study (only the helmet and extraoral mouth protector were mandatory), the respective figure was 10.6%. The most frequent causes of injury were a blow from another player (in American football, basketball, and handball) or a blow from the stick (in bandy). In American football, the mean cost of treatment related to maxillofacial and dental injuries was only 60% of the mean total cost of all injuries. In contrast, the mean cost of treatment for maxillofacial and dental injuries in basketball and bandy was twice and three times as high, respectively, as that for all injuries. The need for adequate facial protection in contact sports is also discussed.\r"

Team members (N = 87) were interviewed weekly in January and February during 8 weeks of their competitive season. Symptoms, signs, and their duration were recorded on a standard form, as well as the number of days of absence from at least one class or team practice or competition. Mean prevalence of illness was 54 per 100 persons during the first 5 weeks of the study and 30 per 100 persons during the last 3 weeks. Eight-six percent of the athletes had at least one respiratory illness during the 8 week period and 40% reported skin problems. There were no significant differences among teams for respiratory or skin problems. Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly more frequent among swimmers than among wrestlers or gymnasts (chi 2 = 16.1, df = 2, P less than 0.001). During an illness, an athlete was less likely to miss class than practice or competition (chi 2 = 5.33, df = 1, P less than 0.05). We conclude that there were no significant differences in the prevalence of illness among the three teams except that swimmers had more gastrointestinal problems as well as a transient syndrome associated with abnormal water quality (pH) in the swimming pool.\r"

Eleven subjects (10.6%) were diagnosed as having connective tissue injuries. Those subjects with connective tissue injuries had a significantly higher (P less than 0.05) mean plasma hydroxyproline value (4.02 micrograms/ml) than subjects without injury (3.10 micrograms/ml). The majority of graduates (75%) had plasma hydroxyproline values less than 3.3 micrograms/ml. These graduates represented the strongest and most enduring injury-free subjects. Of the subject pool who incurred connective tissue injuries, only 27% had plasma hydroxyproline values less than 3.3 micrograms/ml. The majority of the injured subjects (73%) had plasma hydroxyproline values greater than or equal to 3.3 micrograms/ml. In conclusion, there is a relationship between initial training basal plasma hydroxyproline levels and connective tissue injuries later incurred in an intense physical training program. These data suggest that elevated plasma hydroxyproline levels may represent a risk factor associated with connective tissue injuries.\r"

Death follows a rigid, vegetative state that manifests days to months after disease onset and is marked in some cases by prominent autonomic disturbances, blindness, and cessation of head growth. Symmetrical hemispheric white matter lucencies and diffuse hypomyelination of the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem are the radiological and pathological hallmarks. This disease differs from the known diseases of cerebral myelin. An autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance awaits statistical confirmation.

Specifically, there was no tendency to frequent infections, and immunoglobulins, alpha-fetoprotein, T- and B-lymphocyte markers, and chromosomes 7 and 14 were normal in all tested patients. The simultaneous absence of telangiectasias and of other nonneurological manifestations made ataxia-telangiectasia an unlikely diagnosis. We suggest that these patients suffer from an unusual type of spinocerebellar degeneration.

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that preoperative and postoperative factors can broadly stratify patients with medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (MB/PNET) into risk groups. For children with factors that suggest poor outcome after treatment with surgery and radiotherapy, the addition of chemotherapy can improve survival. Since 1983, 26 children with poor-risk posterior fossa MB/PNET have been treated at our institution with craniospinal radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of vincristine during radiotherapy and eight 6-week cycles of vincristine, cis-platinum, and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU). Twenty-five of 26 patients (96%) who have been entered on this protocol remain alive and free of disease at a median of 24 months from diagnosis (range 6 to 50 months). Twenty patients have completed all therapy and are at a median of 32 months from initial diagnosis with no evidence of disease. These patients were compared to a group of children with similar prognostic features treated at our institution between 1975 and 1983. Actuarial disease-free survival was statistically significantly better for protocol patients than for historical control subjects (p less than 0.002). This difference was most marked in patients who had received radiation therapy alone (p less than 0.0003). Actuarial 2-year disease-free survival was 96% for patients on protocol as compared to 59% for historical control patients who had been treated with radiotherapy alone. The chemotherapy given in this protocol was well tolerated. The results of this study, although preliminary, suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy is at least transiently effective in improving the rate of disease-free survival for children with poor-risk MB/PNET.\r"

Galactosylceramide concentrations were not increased in nervous tissues or other organs. Using a sensitive assay method, we found galactosylsphingosine accumulations in GLD tissues, both infantile and fetal, which suggests that GLD is a generalized galactosylsphingosine storage disease. High galactosylsphingosine levels were observed in the brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve of infants with GLD and in the spinal cord of a fetus with GLD, where lesions characteristic to GLD were noted. In tissues without morphological changes, such as somatic organs and the brain in fetal GLD, galactosylsphingosine concentrations were low. These results suggest that a close relationship exists between galactosylsphingosine accumulation and the pathogenesis of GLD. The finding that galactosylsphingosine, but not galactosylceramide, accumulates in the tissue of GLD can be explained by our previous observation that galactosylceramide, but not galactosylsphingosine, is readily hydrolyzed by an intact galactosylceramidase II, which is genetically distinct from galactosylceramidase I.\r"

  ".W": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a progressive loss of locus ceruleus neurons. These noradrenergic neurons receive a major afferent projection from epinephrine neurons in epinephrine cell groups in the brainstem. The epinephrine neurons have a specific enzymatic marker, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), which allows them to be identified chemically and immunohistochemically. We have previously reported a decrease in PNMT in brains of patients with AD. We now report that the decrease in PNMT activity in projections to the locus ceruleus is not due to the loss of epinephrine neurons, although up to 33% of these neurons are atrophic. The decrease in presynaptic PNMT does, however, correlate with the loss of postsynaptic locus ceruleus neurons in brains from AD patients. The percentage of degenerating neurons in the epinephrine nuclei also correlates significantly with the amount of loss of locus ceruleus neurons in AD. In addition, there is a 55% decrease in mitogen activity, a nonspecific measure of growth or maintenance factors, in dialysed locus ceruleus extracts from the AD patients compared to those from control subjects. The mitogen activity in the locus ceruleus was significantly correlated with PNMT activity and with the density of locus ceruleus neurons in all cases examined. These findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that retrograde degeneration is a mechanism of neuronal degeneration in AD and suggest that trophic factors may play a role in this process.\r"

The most common, an antibody against 34- to 38-kDa and 62- to 64-kDa protein antigens in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells, was found in 18 patients. It is a highly specific marker for a severe stereotypical subacute pancerebellar syndrome of truncal and appendicular ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus in women with cancer (usually ovarian or breast carcinoma). Different anti-Purkinje cell antibodies (APCA) were found in 2 other patients with PCD. With two possible exceptions, an APCA was not found in patients with other neurological diseases, with cancer not associated with neurological symptoms, or in normal subjects. Antibodies reactive with neuronal nucleoproteins were identified in 3 other patients with PCD: an antibody that recognized 35- to 40-kDa neuronal antigens was found in 2 women with small-cell lung carcinoma, while an antibody in a woman with breast carcinoma identified 53- to 61-kDa and 79- to 84-kDa antigens. Detection of an antineuronal antibody in a patient without known cancer should prompt a careful search for a tumor at a site appropriate to the antibody type.\r"

Cortical components P2 and N2 were recorded in all normal subjects. The mean peak latencies of P2 were 20.3 +/- 0.9 (standard deviation), 21.1 +/- 1.2, 23.5 +/- 1.4, 27.9 +/- 2.0, and 38.1 +/- 1.8 msec at the T-10, T-12, L-5, midgluteal and ankle sites of stimulation, respectively. No substantial difference in morphology of P2 and N2 was seen between magnetic and electrical stimulation at T-12. Amplitudes of P2 and N2 were maximal after magnetic stimulation at motor threshold. P2 and N2 may originate from the sensory cortex. P2 and N2 evoked by T-10 and T-12 stimulation were normal in peak latency and morphology in patients with polyneuropathy or polyradiculoneuropathy. Peak latencies of P2 and N2 evoked by T-10 and T-12 stimulation were significantly delayed in patients with myelopathy. The patients with radiculopathy showed a delayed peak latency and conduction time of P2 evoked by L-5 stimulation. Magnetic stimulation of spinal root is able to detect lesions of spinal cord noninvasively.\r"

A total of 174 postmenopausal women participated in our study. There was little relationship found between androgen hormones and radial bone density. Estrone levels were independently related to radial bone density. Examination of the relationship of calcium intake to bone revealed a protective effect solely in women who reported high \"lifetime\" calcium intakes. Taking calcium and estrone together revealed an additive relationship between the two factors, in that women with high estrone and high calcium levels had significantly greater bone density than women with less calcium and/or estrone. The results suggest that a lifetime of adequate calcium intake coupled with adequate levels of serum estrogens could maximize bone density after menopause.\r"

Twenty-two courses of DDP plus DDTC were given to 10 patients. No nephrotoxic effects were seen at DDP doses of 50-120 mg/m2, and three patients had amelioration of nausea and vomiting. Objective antitumor responses were observed. Dose-limiting toxic effects from DDTC occurred at 150 mg/kg; these consisted of numbness in the infusion arm often accompanied by severe diaphoresis, chest discomfort, and agitation during DDTC infusion. These toxic effects resolved spontaneously, however, after termination of the infusion. The preliminary results suggest that plasma levels of DDTC that provide excellent protection in rodents were exceeded at the doses used in our clinical study without compromising antitumor response.\r"

Eight neonates are reviewed who presented with the clinical features of spinal cord injury and who had myelography performed.

Myelography revealed that 7 patients had the early changes of swollen cord and 1 patient had the late changes of cord atrophy. None of the neonates had surgical intervention. One neonate died at 3 days of age, while 2 others died after prolonged ventilation. Of the 5 infants who survived, 3 still require ventilation and have spastic quadriparesis, 1 has almost recovered completely and 1 had spontaneous respiration and limb movement but brisk deep tendon reflexes when last examined at 1 month of age. Myelography, which was performed in the early neonatal period in our infants, was abnormal in all patients. Myelography is useful in confirming the diagnosis, outlining the level and extent of the lesion, and excluding extramedullary compression. Myelography may assist in the assessment of prognosis but did not alter management in our patients.\r"

Seventeen dysphasic, brain-damaged children and 11 age-matched children with neurologic deficits but without language delay were examined. Their scores were 57.7 +/- 11.7 and 70.6 +/- 21.9, respectively (p less than 0.05). Finally, each of the brain-damaged groups was compared with age-matched controls. Although the control children performed far better than the dysphasic children (77.6 +/- 20.9 and 57.5 +/- 11.7, respectively, p less than 0.001), there was no significant difference between controls and neurologically impaired children without language delay (77.6 +/- 20.9 and 70.6 +/- 21.9, respectively). We conclude that color association in normal children is already operative at 3.5 years and approaches maturity by 4.5-5.5 years. This function was preserved in neurologically impaired children without language delay but was significantly distrubed in the dysphasic children; therefore, the use of color should be assessed in the habilitation of children.\r"

Quantitative analysis of rapid Golgi impregnations of the visual cortex revealed significantly reduced dendritic length and branching of apical and basal dendrites from pyramidal neurons in 1 patient and less striking attenuation of dendritic arborization in 2 others. The literature suggests that the intellectual deficit in Duchenne muscular dystrophy is nonprogressive and unrelated to age or severity of muscle disease, although performance intelligence quotient may deteriorate with progressive muscle weakness. Golgi analysis suggested that abnormal dendritic development and arborization may underlie intellectual impairment. Although the pathogenesis of the cellular defect is not fully known, the coexistence of central nervous system and muscle pathology raises the possibility of a common molecular mechanism.\r"

Although the percentage of vacuolated lymphocytes increased with duration of the illness in 5 of 6 patients who were younger than 11 years of age, there was no such tendency in 4 patients who were older than 13 years. This result may indicate that vacuolated lymphocytes increase with the duration of illness until an age of saturation. Three to 46% of lymphocytes contained lipopigments consisting of granular matrix and fingerprint profiles which were unrelated to age. Lymphocytes with fingerprint profiles constituted less than 12% of the total and could not be found during examination of 100 lymphocytes in 6 of 22 specimens.\r"

On subsequent computed tomography at over 4 months of age, SLD had disappeared and anterior horn predominant dilatation of the lateral ventricles had appeared. Only 1 patient with a distinct SLD had a poor neurodevelopmental outcome: spastic diplegia. SLD in our patients is believed to be closely related to subcortical leukomalacia because of the similar location and age distribution. Transient SLD may be a mild form of cystic SLD which would require careful computed tomography follow-up examination in early infancy.\r"

From these results it was determined that acute cerebellar ataxia was induced by a direct invasion of mumps virus. Electroencephalography demonstrated normal background activity, although alpha-like activity appeared bilaterally in the frontal regions which was induced by eye closure and decreased by eye opening. Polygraphic electroencephalography revealed that the alpha-like activity corresponded to the ocular movement recorded above or lateral to the eyelids by electro-oculography; therefore, the alpha-like activity was considered to be derived from the opsoclonus which was secondary to cerebellar involvement. His neurologic symptoms improved gradually and resolved completely within 3 months after the onset of acute cerebellar ataxia.\r"

The patient, born to a mother with myasthenia gravis, suffered additional problems, including hypoxia and subependymal hemorrhage which potentially contributed to hypotonia and poor respiratory effort, thus complicating the diagnosis. Standard testing with edrophonium originally was negative which cast doubt on the diagnosis; however, a repetitive motor nerve stimulation test demonstrated a significant decremental response which was consistent with neonatal myasthenia gravis. This decremental response was corrected following intravenous infusion of edrophonium. In the newborn with suspected myasthenia gravis, repetitive motor nerve stimulation may be a more reliable diagnostic procedure than the more frequently recommended pharmacologic tests. Use of this electrodiagnostic procedure in combination with pharmacologic testing may improve diagnostic accuracy in the premature infant and lead to earlier treatment.\r"

The effectiveness of this technique was compared to conventional computed tomography (CT) using iodinated contrast enhancement. Cultured canine gliosarcoma cells were injected into the left hemisphere of adult mongrel dogs. The dogs developed brain tumors and progressive clinical signs. Serial MRI with and without gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid was compared to serial CT with and without sodium iothalamate obtained on the same days. After the final scans, animals were sacrificed; the brains were removed and processed for routine histopathologic study. All tumors were visualized with contrast-enhanced MRI which proved most sensitive. Gadolinium di-ethylene triamine penta-acetic acid caused bright enhancement of tumors in a distribution that consistently corresponded to areas of pathologically proved tumor infiltration. Gross and microscopic autopsy findings correlated better with MRI than with CT which tended to produce poorer resolution and underrepresent the size of viable tumor. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is more accurate than unenhanced MRI, unenhanced CT, or enhanced CT in defining the histologic margins of tumors.\r"

Fourteen patients were identified (incidence: 1%). The primary reasons for obtaining computed tomographic scans included various clinical conditions but excluded symptoms indicative of posterior fossa disease. Developmental or neurologic abnormalities were present in 62% of these patients. Macro cisterna magna should not be dismissed as a normal variant, although the neurologic findings may not be specifically localized to the posterior fossa. This finding may be a marker for abnormal brain function most likely due to subtle disturbances in brain development.\r"

Other antiepileptic drugs were discontinued in 8 of 10 patients with refractory seizures. Mean primidone levels were 10.6 +/- 4.4 micrograms/ml by day 3 and remained stable until discharge. Phenylethylmalonic acid was detected by 6 hours and increased to 11.1 +/- 4.0 micrograms/ml by day 7. Phenobarbital levels in 3 of 10 patients not previously treated with phenobarbital ranged from 0.6-3.4 micrograms/ml by day 5. The mean initial phenobarbital level was 30.1 +/- 10.5 micrograms/ml and had decreased to less than 15 micrograms/ml by day 7. Seizure control occurred within 5 days in 8 of 10 patients and was achieved by day 3 in 6 of 8 patients, coinciding with primidone levels greater than 10 micrograms/ml. No toxic effects of primidone were observed. All levels decreased during subsequent examinations suggesting auto-induction of metabolic systems. Our data indicate that seizure control is best correlated with primidone and phenylethylmalonic acid levels and unrelated to phenobarbital levels in this age group.\r"

In our study, photo-evoked eyelid microvibration response was not obtainable; laterality was indicated in visual evoked potential and electroencephalographic studies, and the remaining evoked potentials demonstrated normal responses. The results obtained from the brainstem reflex (photo-evoked eyelid microvibration) suggest that the pathologic focus of Fisher syndrome is located in the midbrain, particularly in the pretectum.

Its characteristics in this select group were different from tinnitus seen in other groups. Specifically, tinnitus prevalence seemed to be independent of age, state of hearing and duration of noise exposure if greater than 10 years. The reasons for these differences are unclear, though the possibility of financial motivation by some claimants is raised. Further work in this area is urgently required to achieve standardization and objectivity. Being a subjective complaint these aims will be difficult to accomplish. However not until then can a fair handicap scale be developed for workers who develop this disquieting symptom as a result of their occupation.\r"

However, no previous electrophysiological studies have investigated the effect of this operation on facial nerve function. Eleven patients undergoing transtympanic facial nerve needling were investigated with electromyography. Following operation reduction in the abnormal discharges and synkinesis typical of hemifacial spasm was seen in the majority of patients. The success of this type of operation, although temporary in some patients, together with other neurophysiological studies conflicts with the hypothesis that this disorder is due to ephaptic transmission caused by vascular compression of the facial nerve in the cerebello-pontine angle.\r"

The results showed that it is possible to identify reliably the well-designed trouble-free cavity by the features of its skin lining and the ability to visualize the entire cavity through a size 4 Siegle speculum. A patient with this form of cavity very rarely develops aural discharge following water exposure and need not protect the ear during washing but should do so when swimming because of caloric effects.\r"

The tubes improved the hearing in 86% of ears with a conductive loss secondary to a middle ear effusion to an average 5 dB airbone gap. They improved the early stage retracted tympanic membrane but had no effect on the established postero-superior retraction pocket. They were successful in treating barotrauma. The main complication with their use was otorrhoea which occurred in 28% of ears, and persistent perforation occurring in 6% of the ears. Seventy-seven per cent of tubes were in place after 36 months. Extrusion was significantly related to infection in the ear, and also to the presence of glue on insertion but there was no correlation between the number of previous grommets or the age of the patient. The Goode T-tube is advocated for use in middle ear effusion refractory to conventional grommet insertion or that due to cleft palate.\r"

Forty-five percent of our patients were found to have infection spread beyond the mastoid. Meningitis was the most common complication (13 patients). Most of the patients who presented without post auricular swelling were diagnosed as a result of having one or more complications. We believe that in cases of intracranial pathology or septic fever associated with ear disease, the diagnosis of mastoiditis is most likely. Early operation combined with appropriate antibiotic treatment can prevent further complications and fatal outcome.\r"

In the first part, patients from a controlled trial of the treatment of bilateral glue ear using unilateral grommet insertion are reviewed 15 years later. Tympanosclerosis due to grommet insertion is summated using computer graphics. Two areas of maximal tympanosclerosis are found, anteriorly and posteriorly midway between the annulus and the umbo. These maximal areas join inferiorly in the classical horse shoe shape. In an attempt to identify reasons for this distribution, the structure of the lamina propria is reviewed, and the changes that occur in tympanosclerosis considered. With this in mind, the tympanic membrane is modelled using finite element methodology to determine the areas of maximal shear stresses. These are found to be in the same position as tympanosclerosis. Such stresses would be increased by the weight of a grommet in situ. These stresses will damage the fibrils interconnecting between the fibrous layers of the lamina propria and this may lead to tympanosclerosis. This raises the question of whether a lighter grommet would decrease the incidence of grommet-induced tympanosclerosis.\r"

The tumour showed a bimodal age distribution and 30% of the patients were under 30 years of age. The imaging characteristics on plain film, computed tomography and magnetic resonance combined with intravenous gadolinium DTPA are detailed. None of the changes described is wholly specific. However, a tumour in the ethmoids and upper part of the nasal cavity, which expands into the orbit and erodes the roof of the fronto-ethmoid complex or cribriform plate unilaterally in a young patient, is highly suggestive of olfactory neuroblastoma, particularly if this is combined with the magnetic resonance signal characteristics of a vascular tumour. The typical MR features are those of an intense signal on pre-contrast T2 weighted spin echo sequences and strong enhancement after gadolinium on T1 weighted sequences. A characteristic feature of the response to gadolinium is an enhancement of tumour higher than that of turbinate mucosa on inversion recovery and less than that of mucosa when T1 weighted spin echo sequences are employed. The extent of tumour in the paranasal sinuses and anterior cranial fossa is best demonstrated after magnetic resonance with intravenous gadolinium and this is now regarded as the most accurate method of preoperative assessment of these patients prior to craniofacial surgery.\r"

Cholesteatoma was found in 33% of previously unoperated ears and in 71% with an attic or posterior marginal defect. It can be concluded from these results that aural polypectomy in the presence of a mastoid cavity is a satisfactory procedure but in a previously unoperated ear a more radical procedure should be considered because of its frequent association with underlying cholesteatoma.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable controversy exists as to whether lithium maintenance therapy is associated with the development of renal insufficiency. In 1980 we initiated a prospective study of renal function in manic-depressive patients beginning lithium therapy. None of the patients had evidence of pre-existing renal disease. Sixty-five patients were entered, and 51 and 18 patients completed 1 and 3 years of follow-up, respectively. Lithium doses were titrated to the lowest level consistent with control of psychiatric symptoms; there were no episodes of overt lithium intoxication. Serum creatinine levels in all patients, and endogenous creatinine clearance in women, remained stable over the course of the study. In contrast, creatinine clearances (mean +/- SEM, ml/min/1.73 m2) in men significantly decreased over both 1 year (110 +/- 4 to 95 +/- 5, n = 21, p = 0.0126) and 3 years (107 +/- 4 to 80 +/- 11, n = 8, p = 0.0385) of evaluation. Although all patients demonstrated a mild reduction in renal concentrating ability after initiation of lithium, the decrease was not progressive over the course of the study. Quantitative urinary protein excretion did not change, and repeated urinalyses did not reveal any evidence of renal disease. Thus, lithium therapy appears to result in modestly reduced rates of glomerular filtration, as measured by endogenous creatinine clearance, in men receiving lithium maintenance therapy for manic-depressive illness. Whether this reduction is progressive and leads to clinically significant renal insufficiency requires further investigation.\r"

Secondary disease was present in 21, and a further 21 were lost or followed for less than 12 months. The remaining 67 with idiopathic membranous nephropathy were allotted to one of three groups. Group 0 (26 patients) received no active treatment, Group 1 (12 patients) a combination of cyclophosphamide, dipyridamole and warfarin, and Group 2 (21 patients) high dose alternate day prednisolone therapy. Eight patients received other treatment or presented with end stage renal disease. No significant difference in outcome could be detected between the groups. Remission rates were equivalent as were numbers of patients judged as having progressive disease. There was no statistical difference with respect to duration of nephrotic syndrome, plasma creatinine at the end of study and change in plasma creatinine. No demonstrable benefit was obtained in predicting the outcome of disease or response to treatment from conventional pathological grading of stages I to IV as approximately equal numbers of each stage fell into good and bad categories of outcome. Similarly unusual histological features such as mesangial proliferation and immunofluorescence for deposits other than IgG and C3 were not helpful. A different approach to treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy is strongly recommended.\r"

This is not true for the ingestion of a pharmacologically active agent that is a component in a dietary source. Caffeine is contained in foods and beverages that are regular components of the diet for many people. Because daily intake is unsystematic, a computer program was written to simulate caffeine plasma concentration-time courses following ingestion of variable amounts on irregular schedules. Literature values for caffeine pharmacokinetics, for the caffeine content in various foods and beverages, and for consumer habits were employed to simulate various caffeine plasma concentration-time courses. By searching for predictable traits in a wide variety of plasma concentration-time courses representing normal adults, a simple noncomputer method was developed to allow individuals to estimate caffeine plasma concentrations based on personal intake habits. Changes in the time courses due to smoking, oral contraceptive use, and liver disease, all of which alter caffeine pharmacokinetics, were also examined.\r"

The drugs were administered to 16 healthy females for a single day according to the recommended daily dosages. For comparison, Furadantine MC was administered both at the qid dosage recommended by the manufacturer and at tid dosage. Pharmacokinetic parameters determined were maximum plasma concentration after first dose, minimum plasma concentration after first dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), cumulative renal excretion over 30 hours (ARE), overall renal clearance, total body clearance, and bioavailability relative to Furadantine MC qid, based on plasma AUC (F) and ARE (Fren). F for Furadantine MC 100 mg tid was 108 +/- 25 percent (mean +/- SD); for Uridurine 100 mg tid and Urfadyn PL 100 mg bid, F equalled 86 +/- 33 percent and 53 +/- 20 percent (p less than 0.05), respectively. A similar relationship was observed between Fren for Furadantine MC 100 mg qid and the respective Fren of Furadantine MC 100 mg tid, Uridurine 100 mg tid, and Urfadyn PL 100 mg bid. No significant difference was found between the respective F and Fren of each of the drugs studied. Although bioavailability was comparable for Furadantine MC tid and qid, the single-day design of these studies precludes inferring that these dosage schedules are therapeutically equivalent. However, the significantly lower relative bioavailabilities for the prolonged-action hydroxymethylnitrofurantoin formulations suggest that Urfadyn PL 100 mg bid and Uridurine 100 mg tid are not pharmacokinetically equivalent to Furadantine MC.\r"

  ".W": "Medication histories are considered an essential component of clinical pharmacy practice, but they are time-consuming. A study was undertaken to determine how reliable and time-saving a patient-completed medication history form alone could prove to be compared with the amount of information recorded in the medical chart and with a pharmacist-patient form review. Within 24 hours of admission, the patient was given the form to fill out. The pharmacist returned 24 hours later and reviewed the form with the patient. Of 13 questions asked, the form was significantly superior in obtaining information to the chart in 11 and to the review in 6 (p less than 0.05 per question). The review rated better than the chart on all questions (p less than 0.05 per question). The amount of time required to hand out and review the form (mean 7.35 min) was not significantly different from the time required of a pharmacist to conduct a conventional medication history, according to the Canada Workload Measurement Study statistics. It can therefore be concluded that the patient-completed form is not an effective or time-saving method of conducting a medication history.\r"

In certain populations, such as Mexican-Americans, this effect may be much more dramatic. A 50-year-old obese Mexican-American woman presented with a three-month history of increased thirst and frequent urination. A fasting blood glucose concentration of 365 mg/dL prompted initiation of chlorpropamide therapy. A review of her medical history revealed that a thiazide diuretic was started six months previously. A reduction in thiazide dose and potassium supplementation together with chlorpropamide therapy controlled the patient's blood glucose. Subsequently, all three medications were discontinued, and the patient remained normoglycemic during a full year of follow-up. The temporal relationship between symptomatic diabetes and hydrochlorothiazide therapy incriminates the diuretic as the most probable cause.\r"

Because mercury depresses cellular enzymatic mechanisms by combining with sulfhydryl groups, soluble mercuric salts are toxic to all cells. Embolization of mercury in the lungs has been reported with varying degrees of changes in pulmonary function. Mercury causes urticaria progressing to weeping dermatitis, leukopenia, anemia, diarrhea, salivation, liver damage, and renal damage progressing to acute renal failure with anuria. Dimercaprol is an effective antidote in acute heavy metal intoxication because its two sulfhydryl groups successfully compete with tissue enzyme sulfhydryl groups for the offending metal. Experience with dimercaprol therapy months after the original exposure to mercury is not available. We describe the hospital course of a patient after intravenous elemental injection and the results of dimercaprol therapy months after the original exposure.\r"

This occurs to a lesser extent with ranitidine than with cimetidine at doses commonly used to treat gastric acid-related disorders. We recently observed a 66-year-old man whose steady-state serum phenytoin concentration increased 40 percent during one month after the addition to his regimen of ranitidine 150 mg bid. Because the ranitidine had been prescribed postsurgically for prophylaxis, it was discontinued and the patient's serum phenytoin concentration declined to the previous steady-state level with no change in dose or other drug therapy. This case indicates that the serum phenytoin concentration should be monitored for the first month after the addition of ranitidine to the regimens of patients on chronic phenytoin therapy. As well, further clinical investigation of factors affecting the interindividual inhibitory action of ranitidine is warranted.\r"

These 36 interventions were subjected to an independent, blind review by three practicing physicians who were given the same ranking system for clinical relevance as the one used by the peer reviewers. The physicians independently concurred with the peer reviewers on the two interventions initially ranked as 6 (lifesaving in nature). Of the interventions ranked 5 (preserving major organ functions) by the peer-review group, 53 percent were given a rank of 5 by the physicians. However, the remaining 47 percent were given a rank of 4 (upgrading patient drug therapy to the most appropriate level based on professionally accepted standards). In this era of program evaluation and justification, the process of encouraging other health professionals to review pharmacists' contribution to patient care should not be overlooked.\r"

Medications prescribed were classified according to their pharmacotherapeutic properties as described in the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information 87. The findings pointed out that three pharmacotherapeutic categories (the antiinfective/chemotherapeutic, central nervous system (CNS), and respiratory agents) constituted 78.1 percent of the 1402 prescribed medications. The most frequently prescribed agents in each of these categories were, respectively, amoxicillin, aminophylline, and acetaminophen. These agents represent recent advances in drug usage because they became most frequently used only within the past ten years. The age-dependent medication profile indicated that there was a higher prescription rate of antiinfectives and respiratory disorder agents in the younger age groups; in the adolescent group CNS agents were more often prescribed.\r"

Students were asked to estimate the dollar cost of professional liability insurance for a hypothetical family physician in the first year in practice performing low-risk obstetrics in Southern California. Family physician applicants who planned to do obstetrics estimated an initial average yearly premium cost of $16,406, whereas those not planning to do obstetrics estimated costs of $25,710 per year. Non-OB directed family practice applicants had a statistically significant (P = .0018) higher estimate of professional liability insurance costs. Average premium costs were obtained from three separate professional liability insurance carriers. Cost estimates of mature rates were not necessarily unrealistic, but student ignorance of significantly lower initial rates was widespread. The broad ranges of estimates suggested that subsets of students may be dramatically overestimating these costs. The data and direct questioning of students suggest that perceived insurance costs may affect training goals and career choices of medical students.\r"

While the risks of passive smoking on various aspects of health are now becoming accepted, little is known about the effect of smoke exposure on the middle ears of children. We evaluated the association between middle ear effusions and household smoke exposure in children seen in an outpatient office. A dose-response relationship was found between increasing household smoke exposure and the prevalence of middle ear effusions as indicated by abnormal tympanograms. An attempt to minimize smoke exposure via patient education may be one of the few means health care professionals have to effect primary prevention of this potentially morbid disease.\r"

This reciprocal association has been most marked in those provinces with a relative abundance of obstetricians, a falling birth rate, and large metropolitan areas. Yet, the perinatal mortality rate, with one exception, is virtually the same in all provinces, both where the obstetricians provide most maternity care and where the family physicians play the dominant role. Thus, societal, environmental, and interprofessional issues have more to do with the rising number of cesarean sections and the decline of family physician-attended births than any objective measurement of quality of care. There is evidence that low-technology, high-continuity approaches for women at no anticipated risk are as safe or safer than the universal application of highly interventive care for all. This paper presents an attempt to determine if the decline in family physician-attended births in Canada is related to the rise in the cesarean section rate.\r"

The results showed that less than 5% of the family medicine residents were currently smoking cigarettes versus 28% of the NHIS respondents. Daily use of alcohol was significantly lower among men residents than NHIS men, 1.9% versus 13%, but was similar between women residents and NHIS women, 4.9% versus 4.0%. Residents were more likely to consistently use seat belts than the national study population, 74.3% versus 56.8%. There were no significant differences in weight or exercise patterns. However, residents reported a significantly higher incidence of personal or emotional problems during the previous year than NHIS respondents, 50.7% versus 37% for men, and 64.1% versus 49% for women, and were more likely to seek professional help.\r"

The collected and calculated data were presented to the residents after the study period, together with a discussion of coding of patient care services and fees. The same data were collected three months and nine months later. There was no significant difference in coding patterns when comparing first- to second- to third-year residents. Six months after the information was presented to the residents, the percentage of brief visits coded decreased significantly, and the percentages of intermediate and comprehensive visits coded increased significantly. Twelve months later, the changes in coding patterns had reverted to the initial findings. This appears to be an effective approach that could be used elsewhere to teach coding of patient care services as part of a practice management curriculum.\r"

  ".U": "89216265\r", 
  ".W": "In December 1972, an 18-year-old male apparently took an accidental overdose of heroin. After becoming ill, he attempted to receive treatment for his condition by being admitted to the emergency room of Wahiawa General Hospital. When confronted by attending physicians in the emergency room as to the nature of his illness, the youth stated that he had only eaten 10 hallucinogenic mushrooms (an average dose for Copelandia cyanescens, the mushroom in question) and nothing else. This story was most likely concocted either by the youth himself or by some of his friends, who probably thought that they could or would be prosecuted for the use of an illegal substance. It is not uncommon that when confronted by an overdose of drugs, many young people are afraid to report their illness to the proper medical authorities out of fear of prosecution due to their illegal activities (Young et al. 1982). The doctors who attempted to treat this young man should not be held liable for his death, even though their treatment of the patient was more supportive (i.e., the talk-down method) than pharmacological. They had no way of knowing that the patient had lied to them about his condition. While it is true that several doctors had diagnosed Gomilla as possibly suffering from muscarine poisoning, why was no atropine or scopolamine administered to the patient? And why was his stomach not pumped and specimens collected for a toxicologist to study for the presence of toxins?(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Treatment with metronidazole resulted in selective elimination of strictly anaerobic cecal bacteria, with a 100-fold increase in the numbers of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli and a 10,000-fold increase in the numbers of aerobic and facultative gram-positive species. Clindamycin had a similar effect on the cecal flora except that the numbers of aerobic and facultative gram-positive bacteria decreased at least 10-fold. The predominating gram-positive species in the cecal flora or metronidazole-treated mice was an enterococcus, but this organism could not be recovered from the ceca of clindamycin-treated mice. Translocating bacteria (primarily gram-negative enteric bacteria) were recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes of the majority of mice given metronidazole or clindamycin. Gram-positive bacteria were not recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes of 20 clindamycin-treated mice, whereas 26% of 19 metronidazole-treated mice had translocating enterococci. With addition of streptomycin to the metronidazole and clindamycin regimens, mice treated with metronidazole-streptomycin became colonized predominantly with an enterococcus, and this was the only translocating species recovered from 13% of 23 mice; however, enterococci could not be detected in the ceca of clindamycin-streptomycin-treated mice, and Bacillus spp. were recovered from the mesenteric lymph nodes of 8% of 24 mice, reflecting the composition of the cecal flora.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The tetO gene, which is responsible for tetracycline resistance in Campylobacter spp., was detected in six Streptococcus strains and two Enterococcus strains, in which it was borne by similar plasmids. This observation confirms our previous proposal that tetO originated in gram-positive cocci. tetM, the most prevalent resistance gene, was present alone in 109 strains and associated with tetL in 33 strains in which the two genes contributed cooperatively to high-level tetracycline resistance. tetL was present alone in five Enterococcus strains, and tetK was detected in a single Streptococcus strain. The existence of 22 strains that did not hybridize to the probes suggest that tetracycline resistance in streptococci and enterococci involves additional gene classes as well.\r"

This report is concerned with the pharmacokinetic evaluation of the drug in rats and monkeys and its antiviral activity in African green monkeys infected with simian varicella virus (SVV), a virus closely related to varicella-zoster virus that is also susceptible to inhibition by (+/-)2HM-HBG. Elimination half-lives in plasma following intravenous administration to monkeys (100 mumol/kg of body weight) ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 h, and total body clearance was 9.0 +/- 0.4 ml/min per kg (mean +/- standard error). After oral administration, levels in plasma were low, with a maximum concentration of the drug of only 3.1 +/- 0.8 microM, a time to reach maximum concentration of drug of 2.7 +/- 0.4 h, and an oral bioavailability of 10.6 +/- 1.4%. Because of the low oral bioavailability, SVV-infected monkeys were treated intramuscularly with (+/-)2HM-HBG. (+/-)2HM-HBG at a dosage of 10 mg/kg of body weight per day allowed moderate viremia, whereas a dosage of 30 mg/kg of body weight per day strongly suppressed viremia with minimal numbers of virus plaques from blood specimens collected at days 3, 5, and 7 postinfection and complete clearance at day 9 postinfection. Titers of antibody to SVV were also low. Treatment three times daily was somewhat more efficacious than treatment twice daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subjects ingested single 100-mg oral doses of rimantadine after an overnight fast, followed after 5 days by a dosage of 100 mg twice a day for 9.5 days. No differences were observed among the age-stratified groups in measured or derived pharmacokinetic parameters. Peak concentrations in plasma (mean +/- standard deviation) following the single- and multiple-dose regimens, respectively, were 89 +/- 25 and 417 +/- 129 ng/ml for subjects who were 50 to 60 years of age (group 1), 92 +/- 24 and 401 +/- 84 ng/ml for those 61 to 70 years of age (group 2), and 100 +/- 14 and 538 +/- 51 for those 71 to 79 years of age (group 3). The elimination half-life in plasma following multiple doses averaged 33.5 h for group 1, 32.5 h for group 2, and 38.6 h for group 3. Steady-state concentrations in nasal mucus developed by day 5 of dosing (1.5-fold higher than concentrations in plasma), and rimantadine remained detectable in secretions for 5 days after the last dose in 65% of subjects. Stepwise regression analysis suggested that changes in maximum concentration in plasma and area under the concentration-time curve at steady state may be related to creatinine clearance. The results indicate that no important differences in rimantadine multiple-dose pharmacokinetics exist among healthy elderly adults with ages between 51 and 79 years.\r"

Serial blood samples were obtained after the last dose in each regimen and analyzed for clindamycin by a sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography assay technique. Clindamycin pharmacokinetics were estimated by using noncompartmental methods, and serum inhibitory titers were serially determined against Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285 and evaluated by using area under the serum inhibitory curve (AUIC). Maximum and minimum concentrations in plasma averaged 12.2 +/- 1.6 and 1.2 +/- 0.6, 16.3 +/- 4.0 and 0.9 +/- 0.5, and 16.8 +/- 2.5 and 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml for the 600-, 900-, and 1,200-mg regimens, respectively.

To determine what proportion of current gentamicin-resistant isolates elaborated aminoglycoside 3-V-acetyltransferase [AAC(3)-V], a probe for this gene was constructed from a 975-base-pair PstI-SalI fragment of the nonconjugative R plasmid pCER954b. This plasmid was first isolated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from epidemic strains of Serratia marcescens. Nineteen isolates determined to produce AAC(3)-V by MIC profile all reacted with the probe. The probe did not hybridize with DNA from organisms producing 10 other aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme types. With this probe, 30 (36%) of 84 gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli elaborated AAC(3)-V. Of these 30 isolates, 25 contained a conjugative plasmid that transferred gentamicin resistance. In contrast to other medical centers, at Vanderbilt a sizable number of gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli produced AAC(3)-V. This resistance determinant, initially identified in an epidemic Serratia strain, has persisted and become incorporated into currently isolated endemic strains of gram-negative bacilli.\r"

Its potency against CMV was similar to that of the structurally related adenine derivative (S)-HPMPA but higher than that of the reference compounds phosphonoformate and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG). The minimum concentrations of phosphonoformate, DHPG, (S)-HPMPA, and (S)-HPMPC required to inhibit CMV plaque formation by 50% were 15, 0.7, 0.1, and 0.07 microgram/ml, respectively. The selectivity indices of phosphonoformate, DHPG, (S)-HPMPA, and (S)-HPMPC, as determined by the ratio of the 50% inhibitory concentration for cell growth to the 50% inhibitory concentration for plaque formation for CMV (AD-169 strain), were 14, 150, 200 and 1,500, respectively. Corresponding values for the CMV Davis strain were 20, 200, 100, and 1,000, respectively. (S)-HPMPC was inhibitory to CMV plaque formation even when added to the cells at 24 or 48 h postinfection. When (S)-HPMPC was added immediately postinfection, a 24- or 48-h incubation time sufficed to obtain a marked inhibitory effect on CMV replication. Such limited incubation time was insufficient for DHPG to achieve any protection against CMV.\r"

In this report, we describe procedures for (i) producing reuterin in sufficient amounts to isolate from a fermentation mixture and (ii) isolating this substance by high-performance liquid chromatography. By using uniformly labeled [14C]glycerol, reuterin was identified as a product of glycerol fermentation associated with the production of beta-hydroxypropionic acid and trimethylene glycol.\r"

Human PMN were preincubated in vitro with miconazole or AmB at therapeutically attainable concentrations in plasma, and their chemotactic functions were assessed with the synthetic chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). Changes in membrane fluidity of PMN were examined by an excimer-forming lipid technique. Adherence of PMN was measured by a nylon fiber column method. Miconazole and AmB pretreatment irreversibly depressed PMN random migration and chemotaxis under agarose but did not influence superoxide anion production. Both miconazole and AmB increased PMN adherence. Miconazole and AmB lowered the binding affinity of FMLP receptors on PMN and decreased the membrane fluidity in a similar manner. These results demonstrate that miconazole and AmB alter selected in vitro membrane properties of human PMN.\r"

All patients received 500 mg of flurithromycin orally every 8 h. Drug levels in serum, bone, soft tissue, lung, and pericardial fluid were determined microbiologically. The total amount of antibiotic per gram of tissue was calculated on the basis of the concentration in the supernatant of the homogenate. From the parallel course between free concentrations in serum and calculated contents in interstitial fluid tissue, it was concluded that the tissues examined were easily accessible by flurithromycin; penetration values measured by the ratio of areas under the curve were 8.3 for lung, 3.6 for bone, and 0.8 for soft tissue. The results of the pharmacokinetic study suggest that accumulation of the drug during repetitive multiple doses is predictable. Mean residence times were 10.2 and 8.3 h in groups 1 and 2, respectively. For bacteriostatic drugs such as macrolides, not only very high but also prolonged concentrations in tissue lead to favorable therapeutic result.\r"

US data for 1987 are estimates by place of occurrence, based upon a count of all certificates received in state offices between two dates, one month apart, regardless of when the event occurred. Mortality data by cause and age, however, come from the Current Mortality Sample, a systematic 10% of those certificates, and thus may not correspond to the actual month of death. For the US as a whole the estimates, with few exceptions, are close to the subsequent final figures. There are considerable variations in some states, however, particularly in comparing provisional figures by place of occurrence and final data by place of residence. State information should be interpreted cautiously. Careful attention should be paid to differing denominators when studying rates presented in this article. For overall rates, like the birth rate or death rate, the standard denominator is 1,000 total population. In instances in which more refined analysis is possible, other denominators are used, such as 100,000; the character of the population is specified. The particular denominator is indicated in the table or in the context.\r"

Animals were given an intravenous injection of labelled thiamine with a sampling procedure which allowed the determination of regional blood flow and tissue thiamine uptake. Regional blood flow was found to be enhanced after acute, but non chronic, ethanol administration. The magnitude of increase ranged from 13 to 35% depending on the brain region being considered. Thiamine was transferred from plasma to cerebral tissue by a saturable process with a non-saturable component prevailing at thiamine concentrations above 10-15 microM. Three main modifications in the thiamine transport were found as a result of ethanol treatment: a reduction in affinity for the carrier (Km increased), an increase in maximal transport rate (Jmax) and an increase in non-saturable diffusion (KD constant increased). The effects were more pronounced after acute ethanol administration. As a consequence of these modifications both acute and chronic ethanol treatment caused an increase in thiamine transport rate at high plasma concentrations. On the contrary, at low (physiological) plasma concentrations, thiamine transport was little increased by acute ethanol administration and virtually unaffected by chronic ethanol intoxication.\r"

Such investigations include effects on proliferating and non-dividing cells. Physiologic mechanisms of drug action can be studied as well as toxic effects. The culture conditions including the rate of cell growth, the cellular composition and the differentiation degree of the cells, must be defined before the results from culture studies can be interpreted and be attached any significance. Changes in cell morphology after addition of the drug can be followed over time and compared with results from electrophysiology and/or drug influences upon cell metabolism including specific biochemical/functional properties on small groups of cells. Interaction between drugs and substances or hormones added to the incubation media can be evaluated. From a physiological point of view it must always be remembered that primary cultures elucidate phenomena which are devoid of integrative function. In that context results from culture models must be confirmed in experimental systems, using the intact organism to prove validity. On the other hand, primary cultures of the nervous system are very suitable model systems for elucidating biochemical mechanisms, especially those at the membrane level. The culture system enables us to study biochemical mechanisms, like the receptor transduction, at a very precise level, avoiding e.g. drawbacks with the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, specific cells derived either from glial or neuronal origin can be studied separately.\r"

Although there were differences in the patterns of ethanol kinetics for solid and liquid diet controls, the rate of ethanol metabolism was clearly enhanced by both short and long-term ethanol intake. Moreover, longer alcohol intake produced higher metabolic tolerance (congruent to 37.5%) than a shorter ethanol feeding period (congruent to 21.5%). The effect of aging on ethanol clearance in the groups fed the solid-diet showed that the rate of ethanol metabolism decreased with increasing age.\r"

The findings suggest that advertisements for alcoholic drinks become increasingly salient and attractive over the years 10 to 14. For example, although 10-year-olds rarely mentioned advertisements for alcoholic drinks when talking about favourite television commercials, the older children tended to do so almost immediately. There were also consistent developmental trends in their descriptions of liked and disliked qualities of advertisements and of the symbolism in commercials for alcoholic drinks. Whereas the 10-year-olds' comments tended to be tied to what is specifically shown in commercials, the older children tended to go beyond this and alluded to much more complex imagery, much in the same way that adults do. For example, the 14- and 16-year-olds tended to see larger and beer commercials as promoting masculinity, sociability and working-class values. These findings indicate that advertising campaigns for alcoholic drinks aimed at older teenagers and young adults present qualities which younger teenagers find attractive. We suggest it is no longer tenable for advertisers to absolve themselves of any responsibility by saying that advertisements for alcoholic drinks are targeted only at adults.\r"

Alcoholic women report significantly more negative attitudes, both social and personal, than do the non-alcoholic control women. The older group of alcoholic women are consistently harsher than the younger in their judgments, both of social attitudes and in expression of their own opinions. The less negative attitude of younger women alcoholics may reflect more liberal attitudes of younger persons but there is a curious juxtaposition in that younger alcoholic women report more family and social rejection than do older alcoholic women. There is dissonance in younger alcoholic women's report of less negative attitudes and more experienced rejection and stigmatization. Perhaps more rejecting social attitudes towards younger alcoholic women are related to their greater likelihood of public rather than private drinking. When the total sample (438 women, alcoholic and non-alcoholic) is compared in terms of positive family history versus negative family history, those with positive histories are more likely to agree with disapproving statements about women's problem drinking. Significantly more women with positive histories believe that social attitudes are more disapproving of women alcoholics then men, and they believe, to a significantly greater extent than those without such histories, that the effects of maternal alcoholism are worse than those of paternal alcoholism.\r"

Although the focus on attitudes and practices which lead to excessive drinking, and the efforts to change them through education remain the very core of the entire Israeli preventive program, alcohol itself has been considered to be a source of difficulties. The beginning of law-enforcement concerning its availability among youngsters and drivers has emerged, both as a result of several fatal events and intense pressures of the Israeli Alcoholism Prevention and Treatment Services. The present tasks are to reinforce the emerging trends of enforcement concerning the existing laws, to adopt some new regulations pertaining to alcohol advertising targeted at adolescents, and to continue with the educational messages based on Jewish-Israeli norms.\r"

Although the maturation of conduction in the peripheral nerve (from the ankle to the popliteal fossa and from the popliteal fossa to L3) was complete by 6 years of age, afferent conduction in the spinal cord (from L3 to C7) was not complete until 12 years of age or older. Spinal evoked potentials investigated in the thoracolumbar area revealed a phase-reversed potential located between the lower thoracic spine and upper lumbar spine in over 80% of patients. Reciprocal velocities for the major cortical positive potential P1 (corresponding to P37 in adults) and its onset, N1, steadily decreased with age and leveled off at greater than 12 years of age and by 12 years of age, respectively. The propagation velocity from L3 to the cerebral cortex also increased steadily with age, leveling off at greater than 12 years of age. Accordingly, the maturation of afferent conduction in the central nervous system was not complete until after 12 years of age.\r"

Ten of 12 sleep recordings had abnormal background activity with absent or rudimentary spindles. Normal activity occurred only in girls younger than 2 1/2 years of age. Epileptiform activity was markedly increased during sleep in 8 tracings in which both wakefulness and sleep were obtained. It was characterized by bilaterally independent and bisynchronous spike-and-wave activity, maximal in parasagittal areas. One patient had bursts of high-voltage slow-wave activity followed by attenuation. No apneic episodes were recorded during sleep. In Rett syndrome, electroencephalographic abnormalities include background slowing, centrally located short-duration spikes, and increased epileptiform activity during sleep. This activity commonly preceded clinical seizures in patients studied at initial presentation.\r"

Forty-five episodes of status epilepticus in children between the ages of 2 weeks and 18 years were reviewed. Lorazepam and diazepam proved similar in efficacy of seizure control and incidence of adverse effects. The dose of lorazepam required to control status epilepticus ranged from 0.03 to 0.22 mg/kg with a mean of 0.11 mg/kg (S.D. = 0.05 mg/kg). Among children treated with lorazepam, only children younger than 2 years of age had respiratory depression which required intubation.\r"

Continuous (beat-to-beat) measures were taken of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and skin conductance. The diabetic patients were differentiated from the control group by the following: less variability in diastolic blood pressure during deep breathing, failure to exhibit diastolic blood pressure decreases during recovery from a cold pressor stimulus, a flatter blood pressure response pattern when changing from sitting to standing, and a smaller standing ratio (maximum/minimum) for R-R interval. Among the patients, age was negatively correlated with systolic and diastolic standing ratios and diastolic blood pressure variability during deep breathing. By use of the tracking cuff, a method of continuously recording blood pressure noninvasively, we have been able to assess subtle blood pressure changes, thereby revealing signs of sympathetic dysfunction in a group of relatively young diabetic patients with no symptoms of neuropathy. The tracking-cuff method of recording blood pressure has potential in further research on autonomic functioning in diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 15 nondiabetic women participated in a study of the relationship of zincuria to measures of glycemic control, renal function, and tissue catabolism. In the IDDM women, mean +/- SE glycosylated hemoglobin was 9.8 +/- 0.5%, and fasting plasma glucose was 189 +/- 19 mg/dl; duration of diabetes averaged 15 yr. In comparison with control women, the IDDM women excreted four times as much zinc in the urine. However, the total plasma zinc concentration was significantly higher in the IDDM than in the control women (14.7 vs. 13.4 microM). The increased urinary zinc loss in the IDDM women was not related to urine volume, urinary glucose excretion, fasting plasma glucose concentration, percent glycosylated hemoglobin, or an increased glomerular filtration rate. Total urinary protein losses were four times higher in the IDDM women than in the control women, and these urinary protein losses correlated with the urinary zinc losses (P less than .007). There was no relationship between urinary zinc and the excretion of any of the amino acids, urea, or ammonia. The results of this study show that hyperzincuria in diabetes is not associated with lower plasma zinc levels. An increased zinc absorption, decreased intestinal zinc excretion, or increased tissue catabolism may support higher plasma zinc levels.\r"

The sensing device in this instrument is unique because it is reusable for at least 30 days, at which time it is easily replaced by placing a new enzyme-membrane cartridge over the electrode. As little as 7 microliters of undiluted whole blood, plasma, or serum is applied directly to the sensor, and glucose is automatically determined in 30 s. No manual timing or wiping step is required after sample application. On eight production instruments, plasma glucose concentration was determined (n = 20) at 57, 125, 246, and 347 mg/dl. The average coefficient of variation for the 80 determinations for each instrument ranged from 2 to 5%, averaging 3.7%. The instrument is inherently linear, independent of hematocrit, and without oxygen limitation when dissolved oxygen concentration is greater than 35 mmHg. No interferences were found from plasma constituents, heparin, or acetaminophen.\r"

To estimate the confidence limits of blood glucose measurements made in a typical university ambulatory care setting and to ascertain whether they met the proposed standard, we performed duplicate determinations of blood glucose using a reflectance meter and applied to the measurements a method for calculating the closeness of measured values to a \"true\" mean. Based on paired measurements in 100 consecutive diabetic subjects, we were able to show that one measurement would be within 11.9% of a true mean value 95% of the time and within 8.4% of the mean 90% of the time. The 95 and 90% confidence limits for the average of two repeated measurements were calculated to be 8.4 and 5.9%, respectively. Our methodology can be applied to any set of SMBG values to calculate their confidence limits and to determine whether the measurements meet recommended standards.\r"

The oropharynx, with its fine microbiologic niches around the teeth, serves as a source for endogenous pyogenic infections of the head and neck. The anatomic connections of the head with the mediastinum through extensions of the deep cervical fascia, and the intracranial venous sinuses connected through emissary veins to the facial veins, make infections of this region the most dreaded. Perhaps no other set of lymph nodes in the human body is challenged as frequently by microbiologic insults as the cervical lymph nodes.\r"

Eighty-three (83 per cent) had cerebral infarction and three patients suffered from spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. The mean left ventricular mass was calculated from echocardiographic measurements and compared with that of controls. Neither cases nor controls had valvular or congenital heart disease, or disease processes that may be associated with myocardial infiltration. Mean left ventricular mass of all cases was significantly greater than that of controls (p less than 0.025) and that of the cases over the age of 50 years was also significantly greater than that of controls of the same age (p less than 0.02). The clinically normotensive cases had greater left ventricular mass than the normotensive controls (p less than 0.02). Meanwhile left ventricular mass in patients aged 50 and under was not significantly different from the appropriate control group (p greater than 0.2). These data indicate that the frequency of arterial hypertension among victims of cerebral infarction is greater than may be ascertained clinically particularly in those over 50.\r"

We reviewed a 20% random sample of the medical records of 2,067 persons first admitted to hospital in the period 1971 through 1982 with codes indicating inflammatory bowel disease. We also examined all new outpatient cases for a 1-year period from records at the Oakland KPMCP facility. Criteria used to establish valid cases adhered to standards used in previous studies but were revised to reflect current diagnostic methods. The disadvantages of using hospital discharge data have been identified and quantified. In this population, only 21% of ambulatory patients with inflammatory bowel disease were admitted to hospital in a 3 1/2-year period. There was no difference in the incidence of the disorder by sex or between whites and blacks, but it was rare in Asians. A bimodal age distribution was suggested for Crohn's disease but not for ulcerative colitis. During the 12 years of this study, rates of hospital admissions for ulcerative colitis decreased and for Crohn's disease were slightly increased.\r"

The APACHE II severity-of-disease classification was used to identify the cases in which the prognosis was so poor that no long-term benefit would accrue from hemodialysis treatment. A \"risk of death\" was calculated for each patient. At a risk of death of 70% or greater, the system correctly predicted the demise of patients with 100% specificity regardless of what interventions were carried out. Sensitivity and predicted negative value were low in all cases, however, indicating a poor predictability of those who will survive. Withholding the average of 6 dialysis treatments that this group of patients received would probably have reduced patient suffering during a lingering terminal illness and led to a savings of about $4,500 per patient.\r"

Results were compared with responses to the 1985 National Health Interview Survey and other population-based studies. As with research findings in animals, conditions that suggest possibly impaired immune function--that is, respiratory tract infections, asthma, arthritis, and lupus--were reported more frequently among the persons with DES exposure. Conditions that may involve altered endocrine function were also more frequent among such persons. Given the biased sample, findings from this preliminary survey are seen as guidelines to areas meriting more rigorous research.\r"

White lesbians have been shown to be generally reluctant to disclose sexual orientation to their physicians, but little, if anything, is known about black lesbians. Black women, self-identified as bisexuals (N = 65) and lesbians (N = 529), were asked whether they had disclosed their homosexual behavior to their physicians. In the sample, only a third of the women had. Previous sexual experiences, both heterosexual and homosexual, were also queried to illuminate patterns of gynecologic health risk factors. Nearly all of the women reported previous heterosexual experiences.\r"
