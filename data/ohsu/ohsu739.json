  ".W": "Isolated segments from the feeding arteries to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from 24 patients were studied in vitro. In a perfusion chamber, isometric contraction of these arterial rings to various vasoactive substances was recorded and correlated with the following: spontaneous activity, spasm as seen in the operating room; radiographic evidence of ectasia preoperatively and postoperatively; and postoperative course. Of the 24 patients studied, four patients had nonreactive AVM nutrient vessels upon in vitro testing. In addition, these vessel segments displayed no spontaneous activity although all of the other vessels tested developed spontaneous activity while in the perfusion chamber. The patients with \"unreactive vessels\" had an increased incidence of postoperative edema and hemorrhage in the surrounding brain, consistent with the symptoms of normal perfusion pressure breakthrough. Thus, our study utilizes an in vitro technique to evaluate a specific segment of the AVM complex, the feeding vessel, which permitted us to assess abnormalities of reactivity in these vessel segments. This method may be useful for future evaluations of the pathophysiology of AVMs.\r"

Overall success at preventing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage was 90% (121 of 134, 90% effective). In patients considered to be at high risk for CSF leakage intraoperatively but without pre-established fistulae (Group 1), the success rate was higher (111 of 119, 93% effective). In patients with pre-established CSF fistulae (Group 2), the success rate was lower (10 of 15, 67% effective). As single donor sources of concentrated fibrinogen are now available with reduced risks of blood-borne disease transmission, fibrin glue may be a valuable clinical tool for the neurosurgeon.\r"

In previous experimental studies, dehiscence rates of laser-repaired nerves ranged between 12 to 25% whereas that for conventional epineurial suture repair was 0%. In our study, sciatic nerves of rats were transected bilaterally. Results of anastomosis by conventional epineurial suture on one side were compared with those of tissue welding by the CO2 laser using peri-epineurial sheath as a structural adjunct on the other side. At the time of reexploration at 7, 12, and 16 weeks, there was no dehiscence in nerves of either the laser with peri-epineurial sheath group or the suture repair groups. Electrophysiological and morphometric values after use of peri-epineurial tissue as an adjunct to tissue welding by the CO2 laser were comparable to those of conventional suture repair.\r"

On the T2-weighted scans, there was increased signal intensity within the spinal cord at the point of maximal compression. The exact cause of the increased signal intensity on the T2-weighted images is not known, but is suspected to represent edema, inflammation, vascular ischemia, myelomalacia, or gliosis. The increased signal intensity diminished postoperatively in the patients who improved clinically, and remained the same or increased in those whose conditions remained unchanged or worsened after decompression. The authors suggest that these T2-weighted images carry prognostic significance.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal insertion of halo fixation pins to maximize the rigidity of the interface between the halo pins and the outer table of the skull is important in reducing the incidence of pin loosening. An in vitro biomechanical study was performed using cadaver skulls to investigate the effects of pin location on the rigidity of this pin-bone interface. Halo pins were inserted at nine positions within a recommended \"safe zone\" for pin insertion. It was found that the rigidity of the pin-bone interface progressively decreased as pins were inserted more superiorly on the calvaria. The rigidity of the interface did not change significantly when the location of the pins was varied in the horizontal axis. This reduction in interface rigidity associated with inserting pins more superiorly on the skull may be related to an increase in the angle of insertion of the pins with respect to the surface of the calvaria. Based on this study, a change in the technique of halo pin insertion is recommended. Pins should be placed as inferiorly as possible, close to the supraorbital ridge, to achieve the most perpendicular angle of insertion and thus the most rigid fixation. The improved rigidity obtained with perpendicular pin insertion may minimize the rate of pin loosening and other complications associated with use of the halo orthosis.\r"

Partial resection of the tumor led to improvement in 3 of 12 patients, obviating the need for a shunt in 2 of them; there were no deaths and postoperative morbidity was transient and minimal (diabetes insipidus, intraventricular hemorrhage, and left hemiparesis in one patient each). The 5- and 10-year survival probabilities were 93 and 74%, respectively. Patients with neurofibromatosis had a better prognosis.\r"

Patients with cerebral glioma were injected with HpD at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight 24 hours before surgery and photoradiation therapy (PRT). Biopsies of tumor, and where possible, adjacent brain and normal brain were taken for analysis of HpD uptake. HpD was selectively localized into all grades of glioma, and there was a direct correlation between the grade of glioma and HpD level in the tumor. The levels were highest in glioblastoma multiforme (mean uptake of 5.9 micrograms of HpD/g of tumor wet weight) and lower in the intermediate-grade anaplastic astrocytoma (mean uptake of 2.4 micrograms/g of tumor) and the low-grade astrocytoma (1.6 micrograms/g of tumor). Uptake into normal brain tissue taken from HpD-sensitized patients was 0.2 microgram/g. HpD was also localized into the \"brain adjacent to tumor\" region. The selective uptake into the low-grade glioma suggests that PRT may be of use as an adjuvant therapy in these tumors and the detection of HpD in this region indicates that PRT may control the spread of tumor infiltrating into the adjacent normal brain.\r"

The therapeutic activity of i.c. interstitial radiotherapy with an 125I seed was enhanced after L-BSO-mediated glutathione depletion, with increases in median survival of 13.4 to 30.5% over that seen with 125I seeds alone. These studies demonstrate a potential role for BSO in enhancing the therapeutic activity of interstitial radiotherapy.\r"

In other patients, the tumor appears on the CT scan as a hyperdense mass with well-defined margins and homogenous contrast enhancement; this CT finding, which may mimic that of a meningioma, corresponds to a rather well-demarcated surgical aspect and the prevalence of sarcomatous component.

Physiological monitoring showed that the effects of mannitol infusion differed significantly from those of saline infusion and were associated with transient bradycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and electroencephalographic depression. With PB, KX, or IF anesthesia, we obtained excellent BBBD as evidence by 3+ Evans blue staining of the mannitol-infused cerebral hemisphere. FD anesthesia was associated with tachycardia and MF anesthesia resulted in hypotension; both showed poor Evans blue staining. Radioisotope delivery to the disrupted hemisphere averaged 0.80% of the administered 125I-albumin compared to 0.03% in the contralateral and 0.06% in control (saline-infused) hemispheres. 99mTc-glucoheptonate delivery measured 0.49% of the administered dose after BBBD, 0.03% contralaterally, and 0.05% in control hemispheres. Pharmacological manipulation to normalize the cardiac index in the FD and MF groups resulted in 3+ Evans blue staining and significantly increased delivery of albumin and glucoheptonate. This study suggests that the cardiovascular changes of these specific anesthetic agents are important in obtaining optimal hyperosmolar BBBD.\r"

  ".W": "Evoked potential conduction times in brain stem auditory (BCT) and central somatosensory pathways (CCT) were recorded from 23 normal subjects and 101 patients with severe head injury. Abnormalities in the CCT and the BCT findings correlated with the clinical indices of brain damage (coma score, motor response, pupil response, and spontaneous and reflex eye movements) in the head-injured patients and each correlated with outcome at 6 months from the injury. The CCT in the \"best\" hemisphere produced the strongest correlation with outcome (P less than 0.001). The correlation of the CCT with outcome was stronger in the 47 patients examined 2 to 3 days after the injury (P less than 0.001) compared to the 34 patients examined within 24 hours after the injury (P less than 0.02). No such difference was noted for the BCT. Serial studies within the first 2 weeks of injury did not show a consistent pattern and repetition of the investigation over this period did not provide any additional information. We used an INDEP-SELECT discriminant analysis program to determine whether information from the evoked potential data could improve prediction of outcome based on clinical data alone. With the addition of the CCT, the predictive accuracy (expressed as the correct classification probability) increased only slightly from 77 to 80%, and the difference was not significant. We conclude that central somatosensory and auditory brain stem conduction times provide useful prognostic information in paralyzed or sedated patients, but when neurological examination is feasible the benefits of evoked potential analysis do not justify the effort involved in data collection.\r"

Compound muscle action potentials recorded from the ipsilateral nasalis muscle showed onset latencies (mean +/- SD) of 4.48 +/- 0.50 ms with magnetic stimulation and 3.15 +/- 0.40 ms with electrical stimulation, a mean difference of 1.33 +/- 0.14 ms. Stimulation of the extracranial facial nerve at two sites yielded a conduction velocity of 59.6 +/- 4.5 m/s. Based on these findings, the magnetically stimulated site was estimated to fall 79.0 +/- 8.6 mm proximal to the point of electrical stimulation. Taking the average length of the nerve trunk and histological specificity of the root exit zone into consideration, evidence indicates that the root exit zone of the facial nerve is the most likely initiating site of excitation with magnetic stimulation.\r"

Those responses were smaller in amplitude than responses to stimulation of the upper limbs (median nerve at the wrist), and the waveforms differed. The negative deflection that is prominent in the response to stimulation of the upper limbs is more variable, broader, and relatively smaller in amplitude than the response to upper limb stimulation. Another difference between responses to upper and lower limb stimulation was that multiple peaks were superimposed on the initial response to stimulation of the lower limbs, but were not as consistently seen in the responses to upper limb stimulation. The negative peak in the response from the dorsal column nuclei to lower limb stimulation was of about the same latency as the P27 peak in the far-field response (somatosensory evoked potential) to stimulation of the peroneal nerve.\r"

All patients received morphine for a minimum of 9 days and most required morphine for at least 14 days. Patients rated their pain and side-effect intensity daily using visual analogue scales. Patient pain ratings did not differ between the groups although PCA patients used only 53% as much morphine as the continuous infusion group. Tolerance did not develop in the PCA group; in patients receiving continuous infusion morphine dosage continued to increase throughout the study while pain scores remained constant, indicating that tolerance had developed. Nausea, alertness and respiratory rate measurements did not differ between groups. PCA appeared more effective than the hospital staff determined treatment at delivering the least amount of morphine required to produce maximal pain relief. Patients self-administering morphine did not appear to restrict morphine intake in order to minimize opioid side-effects.\r"

There were no significant differences between the 2 treatments. The implications of the results for other antiprostaglandin remedies recommended for treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia are discussed. An important observation with methodological significance for similar studies of chronic conditions was that short treatment periods may produce false positive results. Patients' expectations are high, and if the first study treatment is ineffective, initial significant benefit may be noted when crossing over to the next treatment; this may not last longer than 1 week. Cross-over studies in which neither treatment is effective may, therefore, produce erroneous results if treatment periods are shorter than 2 weeks.\r"

Baseline pain was recorded and then analgetic and side effects and their duration were assessed. Three self-administered questionnaires with appropriate psychometric proprieties were given to the patients. Intrathecal fentanyl always abolished the pain. Its onset was rapid being heralded within 1-2.5 min by a pleasant sensation of warmth involving the lower trunk and legs. Analgesia was complete by 5-10 min and had a median duration of 8 h. The patients had a sense of well being and were unable to elicit discomfort by pain aggravating maneuvers. Normal motor and sensory functions were retained. Pruritus was the only adverse effect unique to intrathecal fentanyl. Intrathecal lidocaine usually relieved the discomfort but was unable to abolish it in 3 of 8 patients despite adequate neural blockade. Its onset of action was slower and duration of effect shorter than fentanyl. Intrathecal fentanyl provided profound analgesia associated with normalization of stump sensations and euphoria, probably due to a segmental spinal action. The effects of lidocaine were inferior to fentanyl due to the associated motor and sensory paralyses as well as the absence of euphoria. This study suggests that, while peripheral mechanisms played a role, central mechanisms involving the spinal cord were more important in the modulation of established stump pain in the 8 subjects evaluated.\r"

The present study examined this issue by comparing the pain ratings in 42 patients hospitalized for burn injuries and 42 nurses. The patient and the attending nurse were asked to rate, independently of each other, the intensity of the pain felt by the patient during a therapeutic procedure and at rest. When analgesic medication was given prior to the procedure, both the patients and the nurses were asked to estimate the degree of pain relief. All ratings were obtained using visual analogue and verbal scales. The results revealed significant but small correlations between the nurses' and patients' ratings. Frequently, the nurses underestimated or overestimated the patients' pain. Discrepancies were also observed in the evaluation of pain medication efficacy, the nurses showing a tendency to overestimate the degree of pain relief. The accuracy of the nurses' perception did not vary as a function of the patients' age, socioeconomic status or burn severity. However, the number of years of experience in burn-nursing had a significant influence on the nurses' estimation of the patients' pain during therapeutic procedures. Theoretical and clinical implications of these results are discussed with a particular emphasis on the need to implement systematic procedures to assess pain and success of analgesia. Additional recommendations to optimize pain management in burn patients are also made.\r"

Subjects, 106 chronic low back pain patients, were divided into 2 samples. The cluster analysis procedure identified 4 very similar subgroups in sample 1 and sample 2. The first subgroup showed a low or moderate level of guarding and a low level of other pain behaviors. The second subgroup showed a high level of guarding and a moderate level of rubbing of the painful area. The third subgroup showed high levels of guarding and moderate levels of bracing and rubbing. The fourth subgroup exhibited a very high level of rubbing and moderate levels of bracing. The subgroups identified may require somewhat different approaches to pain assessment and treatment. The results of this study suggest that the variability in pain behavior evident in low back pain populations may be due to the fact that within these populations there are homogeneous subgroups of patients who differ in the motor pain behaviors they display.\r"

We have compared a group of chronic pain patients with a sample of psychiatric patients attending for reasons other than pain. The pain group had less evidence of poor care in childhood (measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument) and tended to use more mature psychological defence mechanisms (assessed with the Defense Mechanisms Inventory), compared with the other group. The pain group also had fewer current psychiatric diagnoses but more evidence of anxiety and depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We conclude that in general the patients with chronic pain had more normal childhoods and more mature defences than the psychiatric control group. They showed an increase in the diagnosis of depression, attributable to reactive factors. In the sample of patients with pain the majority of the psychological change cannot be attributed to the operation of primitive psychological defences.\r"

In the first study, patients with high PDI scores reported more psychological distress (P less than 0.001), more severe pain characteristics (P less than 0.001), and more restriction of activities (P less than 0.001) than patients with low PDI scores, findings supportive of the construct validity of the measure. Further, a multiple regression showed that a linear combination of 9 variables predicted PDI scores (R = 0.74): time spent in bed, psychosomatic symptoms, stopping activities because of pain, work status, pain duration, usual pain intensity, quality of life, pain extent, and education. This study also showed differences for age and gender on disability. The second study involved 46 patients who had undergone inpatient treatment for their pain conditions. The study revealed modest test-retest reliability for the instrument. It also showed the PDI to be associated with the levels of pain behavior exhibited by these patients. The findings of both studies generally support the reliability and validity of the PDI as a brief measure of pain-related disability. Questions regarding its test-retest reliability and lack of association with certain pain behaviors are discussed, as are suggestions for future research.\r"

Management of the real environmental determinants (home, work, social) of pain and disability should improve the effectiveness of behaviorally based interventions and make these treatments more accessible. Over a 6 year period, 261 patients having various chronic somatic complaints (e.g., pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal complaints) underwent interdisciplinary outpatient treatment based on medical and behavioral sciences. Comparison of patients having field management with patients receiving office-based treatment found a significantly greater reduction in disability with field management. 84% of field managed patients had a successful outcome as defined by: (a) return to regular work, or (b) reduced limitations on work, exercise, and daily living activities, depending on functional status at assessment. Only 61% of patients with office-based treatment were successful. Compliance, defined as the frequency with which treatment was mutually terminated, was significantly higher with field management. The availability of long-term disability benefits was highly predictive of a poorer outcome. However, field management remained effective for improving functional status regardless of the availability of benefits. Finally, determination of the cost of non-institutional treatment indicated that field management is a cost-effective modality. Implications of these findings for the treatment of disability in chronic pain and other chronic illness syndromes are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of GABA into the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) activates medullary neurons that are involved in pain inhibition and potentiates morphine-induced analgesia. These observations suggest that GABAergic mechanisms in the PAG may modulate the descending pain inhibitory system that arises from this structure. In the present study, the effects of GABA and GABA antagonists on membrane properties and baseline activity of PAG neurons were examined using both in vitro and in vivo preparations. Application of bicuculline methiodide (BICM), at a dose that blocked the response to GABA, potently increased the baseline firing rate in 53% of cells recorded in vitro and 74% of cells recorded in the intact preparation. Application of BICM often yielded multiple or burst spiking episodes in both preparations. In 69% of cells the effect of BICM was diminished or totally abolished when the slice was perfused with high-magnesium, calcium-free, physiological saline solution. Intracellular recordings revealed that bicuculline caused depolarization of the membrane (70% of cells), increased the firing frequency (94% of cells) and increased the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (18% of cells). The effect of bicuculline on membrane resistance was not pronounced and in 64% of neurons it did not cause any measurable change in the resting membrane resistance. PAG neurons responsive to GABA and its antagonists were observed in all regions of the PAG. However, the highest number of neurons that responded to GABA and its antgonists was found in the medial and medioventral parts of the PAG. These results indicate that PAG may contain a tonically active GABAergic network that operates, at least in part, through GABAA receptors. This GABAergic system may modulate activity in descending pain inhibitory pathways emanating from PAG.\r"

Systemically administered methysergide (maximum cumulative dose 2 mg/kg) caused significant changes in responses of some dorsal horn neurons to both mildly noxious and non-noxious stimulation. Individual changes provide evidence, in this model, for tonic 5-HT modulation of many aspects of sensory transmission at the level of the spinal cord. Taken together, the changes demonstrate the significant degree of plasticity that exists for some spinal dorsal horn neurons. It is clear that the plasticity of some spinal dorsal horn neurons allows for a much broader response profile than would be apparent under the restricted circumstances of a normal neurophysiologic study. Removal of tonic inhibition on responses to noxious stimuli may be an aspect of neuronal plasticity that functions to provide an immediate change in the way that the nervous system responds to a noxious stimulus.\r"

Two types of BK receptor, B1 and B2, have been proposed in smooth muscles by Regoli. The type of BK receptor mediating the BK response of the polymodal receptor was studied using 3 BK analogs, des-Arg9-BK (a B1 agonist), des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (a B1 antagonist), and [Thi5,8, D-Phe7]-BK (a B2 antagonist). Single- and multi-fiber activities from testicular polymodal receptors were recorded in vitro using testis-spermatic nerve preparations excised from dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, i.v.). Neither des-Arg9-BK, des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK, nor [Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-BK induced discharges in nociceptors at concentrations up to 9.4 x 10(-6) M. Des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (up to 9.4 x 10(-6) M) did not suppress responses to BK (9.4 x 10(-8 approximately -9) M), whereas [Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-BK (above 2.8 x 10(-7) M) suppressed the BK response in a concentration-dependent manner and shifted the concentration-response curve of BK to the right. It was ascertained that [Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-BK had no effect on responses to noxious heat and high K+ solution. These results suggest that the BK receptor mediating the nociceptor response to BK is of the B2 type.\r"

Two distinct quantifiable behaviors indicative of pain were identified: flinching/shaking of the paw and hindquarters and licking/biting of the injected paw. These behaviors were prolonged and intense after formalin and acetic acid. Formalin-induced flinching was biphasic across time, a finding potentially useful for the study of both acute and tonic pain. Of the remaining test agents, only yeast caused significant spontaneous behavioral activity, which was of low intensity but long duration. Different time-courses for nociceptive behavior and development of edema were demonstrated for formalin, acetic acid and yeast. It is therefore unlikely that these endpoints are causally related. Overall, the present data strongly support the use of formalin as a noxious stimulus in tonic pain research.\r"

Although the technology of ultrasonic examination, cardiac catheterization, and angiocardiography must be learned, the value of auscultation of the heart cannot be ignored. Many highly competent physicians who are responsible for diagnosis and treatment of the pediatric patient, including some pediatric cardiologists, may not be aware that they have not yet become experts at auscultation. The skill of auscultation of the heart must be learned by supervised experience with patients in whom a wide variety of normal and abnormal heart sounds and murmurs can be heard. Once learned, the skill can be maintained only by frequent practice in hearing and evaluating both subtle and obvious sounds emanating from the heart and from the pulmonary and systemic blood vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred twenty-nine patients with bacterial meningitis were assigned on a nonselective alternating basis into one of two therapeutic regimens. Patients in Group I received dexamethasone in addition to standard antibacterial chemotherapy of ampicillin and chloramphenicol whereas those in Group II received antibacterial chemotherapy alone. Dexamethasone was given intramuscularly (8 mg to children younger than 12 years and 12 mg to adults every 12 hours for 3 days). Both treatment groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, duration of symptoms and state of consciousness at the time of hospitalization. A significant reduction in the case fatality rate (P less than 0.01) was observed in patients with pneumococcal meningitis receiving dexamethasone; only 7 of 52 patients died compared with 22 of 54 patients not receiving dexamethasone. A reduction in the overall neurologic sequelae (hearing impairment and paresis) was observed in patients receiving dexamethasone. This reduction was significant only in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis; none of the 45 surviving patients receiving steroids had hearing loss whereas 4 of 32 patients not receiving dexamethasone had severe hearing loss (P less than 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the two groups with regard to time for patients to become afebrile or to regain consciousness or in the mean admission and 24- to 36-hour cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count, glucose or protein content.\r"

The enzyme values were significantly increased in infected, symptom-free children compared with a control group of HIV-negative subjects (mean +/- SD: 0.34 +/- 0.01 unit/ml red blood cells (RBC) vs. 0.25 +/- 0.04 unit/ml RBC, P less than 0.01) and a further significant increase was found in symptomatic children (0.45 +/- 0.02 unit/ml RBC, P less than 0.01 vs. infected, symptom-free children). ADA values were slightly enhanced also in the group of infants in whom the state of HIV infection was indeterminate (0.29 +/- 0.03 unit/ml RBC, P not significant vs. controls). These data indicate that increased erythrocyte ADA activity may be a useful though indirect marker of HIV infection in children at risk and be of possible prognostic relevance. Since increased values were present also in children without overt infections or hematologic disorders, and ADA activity of erythrocytes obtained from healthy donors did not increase after 1 hour incubation with patients' serum, HIV could induce large amounts of cellular enzyme infecting directly erythroid precursor cells.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated two situations involving hepatitis B virus exposure among children in day care. In the first a 4-year-old boy who attended a day care center developed acute hepatitis B; another child at the center, who had a history of aggressive behavior (biting/scratching), was subsequently found to be a hepatitis B carrier. No other source of infection among family and other contacts was identified and no other persons at the center became infected. In the second situation a 4-year-old boy with frequently bleeding eczematous lesions was discovered to be a hepatitis B carrier after having attended a day care center for 17 months. Testing of contacts at the center revealed no transmission to other children or staff (representing 887 person months of exposure). Nationwide surveillance data showed that for the period 1983 to 1987, 161 children 1 to 4 years of age were reported with acute hepatitis B. After children with known hepatitis B risk factors were excluded, 25% (7 of 28) of children with known day care status were reported as day care attendees, a percentage comparable to national estimates of day care attendance by this age group. This is the first reported case of hepatitis B virus transmission between children in day care in the United States. Although it appears that day care transmission of hepatitis B is infrequent, further studies are needed to define the risk more accurately.\r"

In the guinea-pig ileum myenteric plexus longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI), dextrorphan, at 100-200 microM, inhibits the electrically stimulated twitch, but this action is not blocked or reversed by naloxone; both (+)- and (-)-naloxone produce similar non-opioid twitch inhibition at comparable concentrations. At 10-20 microM, dextrorphan blocks and reverses the twitch inhibition due to mu and kappa agonists, but the blockade can be overcome only partially by increasing the agonist concentration. We conclude that dextrorphan is an opioid ligand with low affinity and with antagonist effect on opioid receptors in the GPI.\r"

Viral RNA is generated in the nucleus by transcription of an episomal minichromosome containing supercoiled DNA. We have assessed the relative activities of the nuclear and cytoplasmic phases of the CaMV multiplication cycle by monitoring unencapsidated viral DNA forms and polyadenylylated RNAs in different organs of one host plant and in different host species. Systemically infected leaves of a highly susceptible host, turnip (Brassica rapa), contained abundant 35S RNA and 19S RNA transcripts and unencapsidated reverse transcription products but relatively little supercoiled DNA. In contrast, supercoiled DNA accumulated in roots and other tissues of turnip plants but without significant amounts of steady-state viral RNA. Infected but asymptomatic leaves of a less susceptible CaMV host, kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea), contained supercoiled DNA almost exclusively but negligible viral RNA and DNA products of reverse transcription. An allotetraploid species, rape (Brassica napus), exhibited infection characteristics and minichromosome expression levels intermediate between the other two species from which it was derived. We conclude that expression of the CaMV minichromosome is a key phase of the virus multiplication cycle, which is regulated differentially in organs of a highly susceptible host species. Furthermore, this regulation exhibits genetic variation among different Brassica species and controls host susceptibility to CaMV infection.\r"

In membranes of guinea pig brain 125I-APT bound reversibly, selectively, and with high affinity (Kd = 0.3 nM) to a homogeneous population of sites unambiguously identified as H2 receptors by inhibition studies conducted with a large panel of antagonists. 125I-APT binding was also inhibited by histamine, and the effect was modulated by a guanyl nucleotide, which is consistent with the association of the H2 receptor with a guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein. The low nonspecific binding of 125I-APT generated high contrast autoradiographic pictures in brain sections and established the precise distribution of H2 receptors. Their highly heterogeneous distribution and laminated pattern in some areas--e.g., cerebral and hippocampal cortices--suggest their major association with neuronal elements. These localizations were more consistent than those of H1 receptors with the distribution of histaminergic projections, indicating that H2 receptors mediate a larger number of postsynaptic actions of histamine--e.g., in striatum. Colocalizations of H1 and H2 receptors in some areas account for their known synergistic interactions in cAMP formation induced by histamine. The distribution of 125I-APT binding sites did not strictly parallel that of the H2-receptor-linked adenylate cyclase activity, which may reflect heterogeneity among H2 receptors. After UV irradiation and SDS/PAGE analysis, [125I]iodoazidopotentidine (125I-AZPT), a photoaffinity probe derived from 125I-APT, was covalently incorporated in several peptides, among which the labeling of two peptides of 59 and 32 kDa was prevented by H2 antagonists, suggesting that they correspond to H2-receptor binding peptides or proteolysis products of the latter. These probes should be useful for sensitive radioassays, localization, purification, and molecular studies of the H2 receptor, which were previously impracticable.\r"

This cloning method requires neither antibody nor purified ligand. ELAM-1-expressing COS cells bind the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 by a Ca2(+)-dependent but temperature-independent mechanism. Although ELAM-1 is homologous to mammalian lectins, its interaction with HL-60 cells is not inhibited by simple carbohydrate structures. ELAM-1-expressing COS cells also bind human neutrophils and the human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29, but not the B-cell line Ramos. However, Ramos cells adhere to cytokine-treated HUVECs but not control HUVECs, confirming the existence of other inducible adhesion molecules. In addition, the binding of HL-60 cells or neutrophils to ELAM-1-expressing COS cells is not inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (60.3) directed to an inhibitory epitope on CD18, indicating that the ELAM-1 ligand, although uncharacterized, is not a member of the CD11/CD18 family.\r"

The NMR relaxation times T1 and T2 of glycogen in 2H2O were determined to be 1.1 and 0.029 s, respectively. The measured natural linewidth of the carbon-1 proton (12 +/- 2 Hz) is in excellent agreement with that calculated from T2. The visibility measurements made by digesting glycogen and comparing glucose and glycogen signal intensities demonstrate that in spite of the very high molecular weight, all of the proton nuclei in glycogen contribute to the NMR spectrum. The result is not unexpected, since 100% NMR visibility was previously observed from the carbon nuclei of glycogen, due to the rapid intramolecular motions.\r"

Stimulation of osteocalcin gene expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, a physiologic mediator of this bone-specific gene in vitro and in vivo, is associated with modifications in the binding of ROS 17/2.8 cell nuclear factors to two promoter segments that up-regulate transcription. One segment located between -462 and -437 exhibits a vitamin D-dependent increase in sequence-specific binding of nuclear factors. This element (CTGGGTGAATGAGGACATTACTGACC), identified at single nucleotide resolution, contains a region of hyphenated dyad symmetry and shares sequence homology with consensus steroid-responsive elements and with the sequence that has been identified as the vitamin D receptor binding site in the human osteocalcin gene. We have also observed that vitamin D stimulation of osteocalcin gene expression results in a 5-fold increase in protein binding to the region of the osteocalcin box, a 24-nucleotide segment in the proximal promoter with a CCAAT motif as the central core. Our results demonstrate protein-DNA interactions in a vitamin D-responsive element and in a second sequence, the osteocalcin box, both of which are involved in the physiologic regulation of the osteocalcin gene in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\r"

  ".U": "90175366\r", 
  ".W": "We have studied by electron microscopy the structures of native small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles U2 and U5 from HeLa cells. The structure of native U2 snRNP is characterized by a main body 8 nm in diameter with one additional domain about 4 nm long and 6 nm wide. Electron micrographs show that the 20S U5 snRNP, which contains at least seven U5-specific proteins in addition to the common proteins, has an elongated structure measuring 20-23 nm in length and 11-14 nm in width. Two main structural domains can be distinguished: a small head and a large elongated body about twice the size of the head. In addition to the head, the body of the 20S U5 snRNP possesses three short protuberances. The U2 and U5 core RNP particles--that is, of the snRNPs U2 and U5 without the snRNP-specific proteins, look much simpler and smaller under the electron microscope. They both are round in shape with a diameter of approximately 8 nm. With respect to their size, appearance, and fine structure, the U2 and U5 snRNP cores not only closely resemble each other but also share these properties with the core domain of U1 snRNP. We propose that the characteristic shape of each of the major snRNP species U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5 is determined by (i) a core domain containing the proteins that are common to all members of this family, which has the same shape for each member, and (ii) peripheral structures, which for snRNPs U1, U2, and U5 arise from the specific proteins, that give each of these snRNP species its characteristic shape.\r"

This is prevented by giving GSH monoester (orally or i.p.) and also by giving GSH (orally, but not i.p.). The i.p. administration leads to high plasma levels of GSH but does not appreciably increase GSH levels in intestinal mucosa or pancreas. These and previous studies on lens, lung, lymphocytes, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle indicate that there is very little, if any, transport of intact GSH from plasma to these tissues. Cells can use extracellular GSH by a pathway involving its cleavage, uptake of products and intracellular GSH synthesis. Epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract may use this pathway and can also take up lumenal GSH (which arises partly from the bile) by a mechanism(s) that may involve transport of dipeptides or of GSH. It is suggested that biliary GSH normally functions in the protection of intestinal mucosa. Administration of GSH may be protective of the gastrointestinal epithelium and may also serve as a good source of cysteine moieties for intracellular GSH synthesis in the gastrointestinal tract and in other tissues. Administration of GSH delivery agents such as GSH esters is more effective than administration of GSH in increasing cellular and mitochondrial levels of GSH.\r"

These promoters are used in a mutually exclusive manner in clonal cell lines established from either Burkitt lymphoma tumors or in vitro infection of peripheral B lymphocytes. In this paper the role of Cp and Wp during viral latency is investigated. Cp appears to be the promoter normally employed during established latent infection. Analysis of two cell lines that use Wp revealed a deletion spanning Cp in the endogenous viral genomes, suggesting that cell lines exhibiting Wp activity harbor mutated viral genomes with a nonfunctional Cp. However, in contrast to the preferred usage of Cp exhibited by established Epstein-Barr virus-infected cell lines, Wp was shown to be exclusively utilized during the initial stages of viral infection. In addition to Wp activity, Cp usage was apparent by 6 days post-infection. A model is proposed involving B-lymphocyte differentiation-driven promoter switching during the establishment of viral latency.\r"

The composite cDNA sequence has a large open reading frame of 5636 base pairs (bp) with the complete coding sequence for a polypeptide of 1879 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 206 kDa. The derived amino acid sequence contained 194 residues that were identical to those obtained by direct amino acid sequencing of 11 ankyrin proteolytic peptides. The primary sequence contained 23 highly homologous repeat units of 33 amino acids within the 90-kDa band 3 binding domain. Two cDNA clones showed evidence of apparent mRNA processing, resulting in the deletions of 486 bp and 135 bp, respectively. The 486-bp deletion resulted in the removal of a 16-kDa highly acidic peptide, and the smaller deletion had the effect of altering the COOH terminus of the molecule. Radiolabeled ankyrin cDNAs recognized two erythroid message sizes by RNA blot analysis, one of which was predominantly associated with early erythroid cell types. An ankyrin message was also observed in RNA from the human cerebellum by the same method. The ankyrin gene is assigned to chromosome 8 using genomic DNA from a panel of sorted human chromosomes.\r"

Natural lipids from B lymphoma cells enhanced the binding and so did phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin. Phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol had no effect. There was no major difference between the effects of a phospholipid and its lyso derivative. As studied with phosphatidylcholine, the increase in peptide binding was also dependent on the fatty acid composition of the lipid. The binding affinity was increased 10- to 50-fold in the presence of lipid as a result of an increase in the association rate while the off-rate remained essentially unchanged. Our results suggest that lipids, directly or indirectly, induce conformational changes in class II molecules that favor their peptide-binding property.\r"

As two-dimensional gel electrophoresis permits the simultaneous monitoring of individual elements in large populations of gene products, we have used this technique to assess the effect of cycloheximide treatment on the mRNA complement of activated mouse T cells in an objective fashion. Two-dimensional gels of proteins generated by cell-free translation of mRNA from T-cell blasts display about 400 spots; only 5 of these are reproducibly enhanced by cycloheximide treatment and about 4 are diminished. The cDNA cloning vector lambda jac allows analysis of large arrays of molecular clones by cell-free expression, and we have used it in a sibling selection scheme to isolate a clone of one of the prominently induced mRNA species, which we refer to as chx1. chx1 mRNA concentration is increased by cycloheximide treatment of activated B cells, as well as T cells, and it is rapidly and transiently induced, in a cycloheximide-enhanced manner, upon serum stimulation of resting 3T3 fibroblastoid cells. The chx1 protein is hydrophilic, is slightly basic, and has patches of homology with the Jun-D gene product. The chx1 gene is remarkable in its lack of detectable introns and of strong bias against CpG dinucleotides.\r"

Moreover, we confirmed by sequence analysis of 49 independently cloned terminal DNA fragments from two RT lines collected at different times that they lose DNA sequences from their distal ends at a rate of 70-75 base pairs per fly generation. We calculate that the rate of loss from these ends is consistent with the removal of an octanucleotide RNA primer at each round of DNA replication in the germ line.\r"

For this purpose, transgenic (H-2b x H-2d)F1 mice were constructed that carry integrated copies of a modified H-2Kk gene resulting in the secretion from various cell types including thymocytes of soluble H-2Kk molecules. Despite the presence of H-2Kk antigen, these mice were still able to generate an H-2Kk-specific T-cell response. This response was comparable to that produced by normal littermates when stimulated with cells expressing membrane H-2Kk in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. In contrast, only transgenic mice failed to generate a cytolytic T-cell response to soluble H-2Kk antigen expressed by recombinant vaccinia virus and presented by the H-2Db molecule. These data imply the presence of two populations of alloreactive cytolytic T cells. A small fraction of T cells recognizes alloantigen as antigenic peptide(s) presented by other major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and tolerance can be induced in this population by soluble alloantigen. The majority of T cells, however, require the whole cell membrane-expressed class I molecule for recognition. This population is not affected by tolerance induction to the soluble major histocompatibility complex class I molecule.\r"

  ".U": "90175379\r", 
  ".W": "In discussions about the relative rate of molecular evolution, intraspecific variability in rate is rarely considered. An underlying assumption is that intraspecific sequence differences are small, and thus variations in rate would be difficult to detect or would not affect comparisons among distantly related taxa. However, several studies on mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have revealed considerable intraspecific sequence divergence. In this report, we test for differences in the rate of intraspecific evolution by comparing mtDNA sequences, as inferred from restriction site polymorphisms and direct sequencing, between mtDNA genotypes of the eastern African black-backed jackal, Canis mesomelas elongae, and those of two other sympatric jackal species. Our results are unusual for several reasons. First, mtDNA sequence divergence within several contiguous black-backed jackal populations is large (8.0%). Previous intraspecific studies of terrestrial mammals have generally found values of less than 5% within a single population, with larger divergence values most often occurring among mtDNA genotypes from geographically distant or isolated localities. Second, only 4 mtDNA genotypes were present in our sample of 64 jackals. The large sequence divergence observed among these mtDNA genotypes suggests there should be many more genotypes of intermediate sequence divergence if they had evolved in sympatry. Finally, estimates of the rate of mtDNA sequence evolution differ by approximately 2- to 4-fold among black-backed jackal mtDNA genotypes, thus indicating a substantial heterogeneity in the rate of sequence evolution. The results are difficult to reconcile with ideas of a constant molecular clock based on random fixation of selectively neutral or nearly neutral mtDNA sequence mutations.\r"

In the present study, we isolated full-length cDNAs that encode the 80-kDa Ku subunit. Initial screening of a human spleen cDNA library with anti-Ku antibodies yielded a cDNA of 1.0 kilobase (kb) (termed K71) encoding a portion of the 80-kDa Ku polypeptide (identification based on immunological criteria). In RNA blots, this cDNA hybridized with two mRNAs of 3.4 and 2.6 kb. In rescreening of a cDNA library constructed from simian virus 40-transformed human fibroblast mRNA with the K71 cDNA as a hybridization probe, three positive clones were isolated, and that bearing the longest insert (termed Ku80-6) was selected for further characterization. In vitro transcription and translation experiments produced an immunoprecipitable polypeptide which comigrated with the 80-kDa Ku subunit. The Ku80-6 cDNA proved to be 3304 nucleotides in length, with an additional poly(A) tail, closely approximating the size of the larger mRNA. It contains a single long open reading frame encoding 732 amino acids (Mr = 82,713). The putative polypeptide has a high content of acidic amino acids and a region with periodic repeat of leucine in every seventh position which may form the \"leucine zipper\" structure. In genomic DNA blots, probes derived from the opposite ends of cDNA Ku80-6 hybridized with several nonoverlapping restriction fragments from human leukocyte DNA, indicating that the gene encoding the 80-kDa Ku polypeptide is divided into several exons by intervening sequences.\r"

  ".W": "Expression studies of the early EIIa transcription unit (EIIaE) of the adenovirus EIa-deletion mutant dl312 in murine embryonal carcinoma stem cells suggested that these cells contain an activity that substitutes for the viral EIa. To further characterize this cellular EIa-like activity, we analyzed expression of the EIIaE promoter as well as the binding activity of the cognate E2F transcription factor after infection of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and their differentiated derivatives with wild-type adenovirus, EIa (dl312), or EIV (dl808) deletion mutants. We show that, in contrast to the viral EIa proteins that transactivate the EIIaE promoter in F9 cells only after differentiation, the viral EIV products activate the EIIaE promoter most efficiently in undifferentiated F9 cells. We also show that the EIV products induce a specific modification of the E2F transcription factor leading to its cooperative binding to the EIIaE promoter. Although the EIa-dependent transactivation of EIIaE in differentiated cells is also in part mediated by E2F, it does not by itself correlate with the simultaneous binding of two E2F molecules. In these cells E2F dimer binding only occurs as a secondary effect of EIa that also stimulates EIV expression. Our results suggest that EIa and EIV act through separate pathways, inversely regulated during cell differentiation, with the so-called \"EIa-like\" activity contributing to this modulation.\r"

Some slightly resistant colonies with limited potential for growth were obtained when normal diploid fibroblast cells derived from fetal lung were selected with methotrexate or hydroxyurea but careful copy-number analysis of the dihydrofolate reductase and ribonucleotide reductase genes revealed no evidence of amplification. The rarity of DNA amplification in normal human cells contrasts strongly with the situation in tumors and in established cell lines, where amplification of oncogenes and of genes mediating drug resistance is frequent. The results suggest that tumors and cell lines have acquired the abnormal ability to amplify DNA with high frequency.\r"

  ".U": "90175383\r", 
  ".W": "The gene for Friedreich ataxia (FA), a severe recessive neurodegenerative disease, has previously been shown to be tightly linked to the polymorphic markers D9S15 and D9S5 on human chromosome 9. In addition, the observation of linkage disequilibrium suggested that D9S15 is within 1 centimorgan (cM) of the disease locus, FRDA. Although D9S5 did not show recombination with FRDA, its localization was less precise (0-5 cM) due to its lower informativeness. We have now identified additional polymorphisms at both marker loci. Two cosmids spanning 50 kilobases around D9S5 were isolated, and a probe derived from one of them detects an informative three-allele polymorphism. We have found a highly polymorphic microsatellite sequence at D9S15 which is rapidly typed by the DNA polymerase chain reaction. The polymorphism information contents at the D9S5 and D9S15 loci have been increased from 0.14 to 0.60 and from 0.33 to 0.74, respectively. With the additional polymorphisms the lod (log10 odds ratio) score for the D9S15-FRDA linkage is now 48.10 at recombination fraction theta = 0.005 and for D9S5-FRDA, the lod score is 27.87 at theta = 0.00. We have identified a recombinant between D9S15 and FRDA. However, due to the family structure, it will be of limited usefulness for more precise localization of FRDA. The linkage disequilibrium previously observed between D9S15 and FRDA is strengthened by analysis of the haplotypes using the microsatellite polymorphism, while weaker but significant disequilibrium is found between D9S5 and FRDA. Extended haplotypes that encompass D9S5 and D9S15 show a strikingly different distribution between chromosomes that carry the FA mutation and normal chromosomes. This suggests that both marker loci are less than 1 cM from the FRDA gene and that a small number of mutations account for the majority of FA cases in the French population studied. D9S5 and D9S15 are thus excellent start points to isolate the disease gene.\r"

The cDNA encoding the murine IL-2R beta has been isolated by using the previously cloned cDNA for human IL-2R beta as a probe. Analysis of the cDNA revealed that the murine IL-2R beta shows a marked homology with the human IL-2R beta and that it is also structurally related to other cytokine receptors such as erythropoietin receptor. The cDNA-directed murine IL-2R beta formed high-affinity IL-2R in conjunction with the endogenous IL-2R alpha in a murine pro-B-cell line and could transduce IL-2-induced growth signal. In mouse lymphoma line EL-4, the IL-2R beta gene was found to be rearranged by the insertion of the long terminal repeat sequence of an intracisternal A particle, giving rise to constitutive expression of the IL-2R beta mRNA.\r"

The remaining two boundaries (through Iceland and Greece) separate descendants of different ethnic or geographical provenance but lack modern linguistic correlates. These findings support a model of genetic differentiation in Europe in which the genetic structure of the population is determined mainly by gene flow and admixture, rather than by adaptation to varying environmental conditions. Of the 33 boundaries, 27 reflect diverse population origins at often distant locations. Language affiliation of European populations plays a major role in maintaining and probably causing genetic differences.\r"

  ".U": "90175388\r", 
  ".W": "RNAs 1 and 2 of the tripartite cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) genome are sufficient for RNA replication in protoplasts, whereas systemic infection of cowpea plants additionally requires RNA3, which encodes the 3a noncapsid protein and coat protein. By using biologically active CCMV cDNA clones, we find that deletions in either RNA3 gene block systemic infection. Thus, though some plant RNA viruses are able to spread systemically without encapsidation, both the coat and 3a genes are required for systemic infection of cowpeas by CCMV. When plants were coinoculated with CCMV RNAs 1 and 2 and both the 3a and coat deletion mutants of RNA3, 30-60% rapidly developed systemic infection. Progeny RNA recovered from systemically infected leaves in such infections contained neither of the starting deletion mutants but rather a single full-length RNA3 component with both genes intact. Nucleotide substitutions introduced into the coat protein deletion mutant as an artificial marker were recovered in the full-length progeny RNA, confirming its recombinant nature. Intermolecular RNA recombination in planta can, therefore, rescue a complete infectious genome from coinoculated mutants independently disabled for systemic spread. These results have implications for the repair of defective genomes produced by frequent natural replication errors, the possible emergence of newly adapted RNA viruses upon coinfection of new hosts, and further studies of RNA virus recombination.\r"

  ".U": "90175389\r", 
  ".W": "A procedure was developed for the per cell estimation of cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase activities in cultures and whole cell suspensions of murine epidermal keratinocytes (MEKs). Murine keratinocytes cultured in medium containing less than or equal to 0.04 mM Ca2+ can be induced to differentiate by raising medium Ca2+ concentrations to 1.2 mM. The per cell activities of the monooxygenases 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (7-ER) and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (7-EC) were elevated greater than or equal to 2090% and approximately 460%, respectively, within 13-24 hr of Ca2+ shift. These increases could be completely suppressed by supplementation of culture medium with actinomycin D or cycloheximide immediately prior to Ca2+ shift. After prolonged culture in low Ca2+ medium, some MEKs detached from the monolayer. These detached cells had the characteristics of differentiating MEKs but did not have elevated 7-EC or 7-ER activities. Percoll gradient centrifugation of freshly isolated dorsal skin MEKs was used to prepare four subpopulations that differed in their stages of terminal differentiation. 7-EC and 7-ER activities varied among these subpopulations and correlated with the degree of MEK differentiation. Specifically, the lowest and highest per cell activities (greater than 7-fold difference) were in the basal and most differentiated spinous cell populations, respectively. Collectively, the current studies demonstrate that in vivo P-450 activities are markedly different in proliferating and differentiating MEKs and suggest that constitutive P-450 expression may be modulated as a function of changes in Ca2+ concentration that occur during keratinocyte terminal differentiation.\r"

  ".U": "90175390\r", 
  ".W": "High-affinity receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2) are expressed on T cells following activation. These receptors are composed of both alpha and beta chains. Expression of alpha chains and, therefore, expression of high-affinity receptors are critically regulated at the level of transcription initiation. We have further dissected the regulatory elements involved in controlling transcription of the IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (IL-2R alpha) gene. The IL-2R alpha promoter contains a kappa B site and binding sites for additional nuclear factors within a 50-base-pair region (positions -290 to -240 relative to the major transcription start site). These include one upstream of the kappa B site and one similar to the c-fos serum response element (SRE), which is downstream of the kappa B site. Mutation of the kappa B site decreases IL-2R alpha promoter activity in MT-2 cells (a T-cell line that has been transformed with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I), but not in Jurkat cells (a T-cell leukemia line) that have been activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In contrast, mutation of a region upstream of the kappa B site decreases activity in PMA-induced Jurkat cells but increases activity in MT-2 cells. Mutation of the SRE-like site decreases activity in both cell types but the effect in PMA-induced Jurkat is more pronounced. Thus, these distinct cis-acting elements play different physiological roles in IL-2R alpha gene activation in MT-2 cells and PMA-induced Jurkat T cells. These studies provide direct evidence for a functionally significant SRE-like sequence in a gene other than c-fos and the actin genes and identify other elements that are critical for IL-2R alpha gene expression.\r"

Here, we report the use of oligonucleotide primers to amplify, by the polymerase chain reaction, and sequence the polymorphic second exon of the DQB locus from 11 species, spanning more than 40 million years of mammalian evolution. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that of the four human DQB allelic types (DQB1-B4), three (DQB1-3) were found in chimpanzee and gorilla and two (DQB3 and -4) were identified in the rhesus monkey, suggesting that some of these types are 5-20 million years old. The ratio of replacement to silent substitutions was calculated between members of the same allelic type from different species. These results suggest that the evolution of the DQB3 allelic type is more constrained than that of the DQB1 allelic type; both evolve more slowly than the DXB locus, a linked but presumably nonexpressed locus. Further, the clustering of allelic subtypes by species in the phylogenetic tree indicates that allelic diversification has occurred subsequent to the divergence of hominoids. Finally, some haplotype combinations of DQA and DQB alleles are common to several hominoid species and may have been maintained for at least 5 million years.\r"

Quantitative intensity measurements of single individual particles were possible. From these fluorescence data it has been possible to calculate the fraction of R18 dye molecules transferred from the virus to the cell. The redistribution of the lipid probe upon fusion at pH 5.0 had a t1/2 of 46 s, longer than expected for a free-diffusion model. The R18 loss was approximately twice as fast at pH 5.0 as at pH 5.1. No obvious delay until the start of fluorescence dequenching was observed after the pH changes, suggesting that activation processes are faster than the time resolution, 1-5 s, of the current method.\r"

Their effect is likely due to the production of neuronotrophic and/or supportive factors. Here we study the effect of intraocular transplant of SCs on the survival of rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after the intracranial section of the optic nerve. SCs were injected intraocularly in adult hooded rats. Surviving RGCs were retrogradely labeled with horseradish peroxidase applied to the proximal stump of the optic nerve. Results show that intraocular transplants of SCs promote the survival of a large number of RGCs for periods as long as 9 and 14 weeks after optic nerve section. In experimental retinae, surviving RGCs were 2- to 8-fold more numerous than in controls. This finding suggests that SCs are the source of factors that promote the survival of RGCs. Nerve growth factor is produced by SCs, and the intraocular injection of nerve growth factor has been previously shown to promote RGC survival. The rescuing effect of SCs on RGCs is greater than that obtained by intraocular injection of nerve growth factor. This greater effect may be due to the action of other neurotrophic factors produced by SCs or by transplanted SCs producing NGF in a sustained fashion.\r"

Our computations prove that the optimal weighting function for this summation is dome-shaped. The computations also show that (assuming a particular space constant for the correlation function) ganglion cell collecting area and cone density are matched at all eccentricities such that the signal/noise ratio improves by a constant factor.

Product accumulation is exponential with respect to time, indicating that newly synthesized cDNAs and RNAs function as templates for a continuous series of transcription and reverse transcription reactions.

  ".W": "The tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces characteristic reversible changes of cell shape in certain fibroblastic lines: motile lamellas are transformed into noncontractile narrow processes; simultaneously, the actin microfilament network of lamellas is locally disorganized. This reaction to PMA may be regarded as a prototype of reorganizations involving formation of stable cytoplasmic processes. Specific drugs, Taxol and Colcemid, were used to study the role of microtubules and vimentin-containing intermediate filaments (IF) in the development of PMA-induced reorganizations. PMA readily induced formation of noncontractile processes in Taxol-treated fibroblasts; these cells had a profoundly altered microtubular system but noncollapsed IF. A short (1 hr) exposure to PMA induced formation of processes in control cells but not in the Colcemid-treated cells, which had depolymerized microtubules and IF that collapsed around the nucleus. Longer (3-4 hr) exposure of the Colcemid-treated cells to PMA induced partial reversal of the IF collapse; those parts of the peripheral lamellas that contained IF were transformed into narrow noncontractile processes. It is suggested that the local interaction of IF with the actin system is an essential step in the formation of processes from lamellas. The microtubular system controls distribution of IF in the cytoplasm and thus plays an indirect role in the reorganization of the actin cortex.\r"

The possible association of these genetic factors with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (HLA and H-2) was investigated. Among unrelated adult male blood donors, HLA-B35 carriers have PMg (P less than 0.01) and EMg (P less than 0.0005) levels lower than those of noncarriers, while HLA-B38 carriers exhibit a significant (P less than 0.05) increase of both PMg and EMg levels when compared to the other individuals. Furthermore, HLA identical sibs have EMg values more similar than those of HLA different sibs. In the mouse, erythrocyte (P less than 0.001), plasma (P less than 0.001), liver (P less than 0.03), and spleen (P less than 0.04) Mg contents vary significantly according to H-2, with higher values being found in H-2k than in H-2q or H-2b congenic strains. However, non-MHC genes also have an influence on erythrocyte (P less than 10(-10], plasma (P less than 10(-10], spleen (P less than 10(-5], and kidney (P less than 10(-6] Mg contents as shown by differences between H-2 identical strains, which differ by the C3H and B10 genetic backgrounds. In conclusion, genetic factors controlling intra- and extracellular Mg levels are composed of at least three components: MHC (HLA and H-2)-associated genes, non-MHC genes, and tissue factors modulating the respective importance of the first two sets of factors. The mechanisms underlying this genetic system are discussed.\r"

Hybridization was seen on the satellite part of the short arm of chromosome 1R, where the Sec-1 gene has been genetically mapped, in approximately 8.5% of the cells analyzed. The clone cross-hybridized at a lower frequency to rye chromosome arms 1R (long) (4.4%) and 2R (short) (2.6%), where two additional rye storage-protein loci, Sec-3 and Sec-2, respectively, have been mapped. A fourth hybridization site was observed on the short arm of chromosome 6R at a frequency of 3.0%. The cross-hybridization is attributed to a combination of residual sequence homology between the protein loci and the low-stringency conditions used in in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization mapping, in combination with chromosome walking by using molecular techniques, is suggested as an excellent approach to physical mapping of chromosomes.\r"

We report here that weekly i.v. infusions of a macrophage-targeted preparation of human placental glucocerebrosidase in a child with type 1 Gaucher disease increased hemoglobin from 6.9 +/- 0.8 g/dl (+/- 1 SD) to 10.2 +/- 0.4 g/dl (+/- 1 SD) over a 20-week period. The platelet count also increased from a pretreatment value of 30,000 +/- 7000/mm3 (+/- 1 SD) to 54,000 +/- 11,000/mm3 (+/- 1 SD). Phagocytic activity in the spleen decreased during the period of enzyme administration, and there was radiographic evidence of skeletal improvement. These observations document objective clinical responses to enzyme supplementation in a patient with a sphingolipid storage disorder.\r"

This included a blood donor who was initially asymptomatic but subsequently developed AIDS-related complex and two neonatal transfusion recipients who developed AIDS. Isolates from brain and lung replicated to greater than 30-fold higher levels in primary monocyte cultures than did those from blood; no growth differences on primary lymphocytes were observed. Thirteen clones were obtained from seven isolates, and env sequences were determined. The predicted amino acid sequences among these clones differed by only 0.01% but differed by 15-27% when compared to previously sequenced isolates from other patients. The level of envelope amino acid sequence divergence noted among these isolates is considerably lower than that previously reported for other human immunodeficiency virus isolates. No differences in the envelope unique to lung or brain isolates compared to blood isolates were noted. This study provides evidence that mutations in the envelope may not be necessary for disease progression and that other portions of the viral genome may contribute to cell-specific tropism.\r"

The clone 1C11 was immortalized through the expression of the simian virus 40 oncogenes. 1C11 presents two states: an immature epithelial-like state (1C11 precursor) and a more differentiated state (1C11). After induction by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, almost 100% of 1C11 cells continue to divide and have acquired a neural-like phenotype. 1C11* cells coexpress several neural markers, such as synaptophysin (the membrane constituent of synaptic vesicles), the neuropeptide [Met5]enkephalin, and the neurotransmitter serotonin. 1C11* cells store endogenous serotonin and are able to synthesize serotonin from L-tryptophan and to catabolize it by monoamine oxidase B. Moreover, the cells take up serotonin by a carrier-mediated mechanism very similar to that of serotoninergic neurons. The expression of the simian virus 40 oncogenes, which promoted immortalization, does not therefore prevent further differentiation. This inducible cell line constitutes a valuable model for cellular and molecular studies concerning the physiology and the pharmacological modulation of the serotoninergic phenotype.\r"

The potencies of a series of natural and synthetic cannabinoids as competitors of [3H]CP 55,940 binding correlated closely with their relative potencies in several biological assays, suggesting that the receptor characterized in our in vitro assay is the same receptor that mediates behavioral and pharmacological effects of cannabinoids, including human subjective experience. Autoradiography of cannabinoid receptors in brain sections from several mammalian species, including human, reveals a unique and conserved distribution; binding is most dense in outflow nuclei of the basal ganglia--the substantia nigra pars reticulata and globus pallidus--and in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Generally high densities in forebrain and cerebellum implicate roles for cannabinoids in cognition and movement. Sparse densities in lower brainstem areas controlling cardiovascular and respiratory functions may explain why high doses of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol are not lethal.\r"

Recent evidence suggesting that DNA triplexes exist in vivo and showing their potential for chemotherapeutic applications has renewed interest in these triple-strand conformations. However, little structural information is currently known about these unusual nucleic acid forms. We have induced and stabilized triple-helical (dA)10.2(dT)10 with MgCl2 at neutral pH. UV mixing curves demonstrate a 1:2 (dA)10 to (dT)10 stoichiometry at suitable MgCl2 concentrations. Thermal denaturation profiles establish a melting mechanism characterized by the initial loss of the third strand, followed by dissociation of the remaining duplex. The circular dichroic spectrum of the triplex form is distinct from that of a duplex equimolar in (dA)10. NMR studies show that magnesium-induced triplex formation is accompanied by an upfield shift of several imino proton resonances present before stabilization of the triplex form with MgCl2 and the induction of new upfield imino proton resonances. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy measurements on both undeuterated and C8--H-deuterated (dA)10.2(dT)10 triplexes demonstrate dipolar contacts between resolvable imino proteins and both adenine C8--H and C2--H aromatic protons. Hence, MgCl2 stabilizes a triplex structure in which thymine N3--H imino protons are involved in both Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairing.\r"

  ".W": "Specific cell-surface receptors mediate the uptake of plasma proteins into growing oocytes of oviparous species, thereby forming yolk. Quantitatively the most important yolk precursors are the lipoproteins, very low density lipoprotein, and vitellogenin. We show that a single major chicken oocyte plasma membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa as determined by SDS/PAGE under nonreducing conditions is the receptor for both of these ligands. Binding activities for the two ligands copurified on ligand affinity matrices and were inhibited by the same antibody preparations, and the ligands competed with each other for binding to the 95-kDa protein. In addition to these biochemical and immunological lines of evidence for the identity of the vitellogenin receptor with the very low density lipoprotein receptor, genetic proof was obtained. We have previously shown that the mutant nonlaying \"restricted-ovulator\" hen carries a defect in the gene responsible for functional expression of the oocyte 95-kDa protein. Here we demonstrate that this single gene defect in the restricted-ovulator hen has detrimental consequences for the binding not only of very low density lipoprotein but also of vitellogenin to the 95-kDa receptor normally present in oocytes. The intriguing bifunctionality of this chicken oocyte membrane protein possibly relates to its crucial role in receptor-mediated control of oocyte growth.\r"

In homozygotes, injection of phenylalanine causes severe hyperphenylalaninemia and urinary excretion of phenylketones but not hypertyrosinemia. Severe chronic hyperphenylalaninemia can be produced when mutant homozygotes are given phenylalanine in their drinking water. Genetic mapping has localized the mutation to murine chromosome 10 at or near the Pah locus, the structural gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase. This mutant provides a useful genetic animal model affected in the same enzyme as in human phenylketonuria.\r"

In contrast to healthy T cells, the extent of substrate phosphorylation achieved in active SLE T cells (n = 8) was only 15% at 60 min in the 17.5-kDa substrate, 21% in the 23/25-kDa substrate, and 9% in the 33.5-kDa substrate. The rheumatic disease controls (rheumatoid arthritis; primary Sjogren syndrome; n = 8) exhibited a mean 72%, 124%, and 85%, respectively, of phosphorylation observed in healthy T cells. Because the only known mechanism by which cAMP acts is via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), these data raise the possibility of a defect at the level of this kinase in SLE T lymphocytes.\r"

Functional neuronal receptor was only formed when the two subunits alpha 4 and n alpha were coinjected, neither alpha 4 nor n alpha alone being effective. Responses to bath application of acetylcholine (AcCho) have been measured in voltage clamp. AcCho doses as low as 10 nM induce currents of up to 50 nA. Dose-response studies indicate a Kd of about 0.77 x 10(-6) M and a Hill coefficient of 1.5, thus predicting more than one AcCho binding site per receptor molecule. The current-voltage relationship of AcCho-induced currents presents a strong inward rectification. Responses to AcCho were compared to those of three other agonists: L-nicotine, carbachol, and 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP). Sensitivities to AcCho, nicotine, and DMPP are quite similar. Sensitivity to carbachol is much lower, but the currents are otherwise indistinguishable from those induced by AcCho. Five AcCho antagonists--neuronal bungarotoxin (kappa-bungarotoxin), tubocurarine (TC), hexamethonium bromide (Hex), decamethonium bromide (Dec), and mecamylamine (Mec)--have been tested. Neuronal bungarotoxin has no effect on the alpha 4/n alpha channel, whereas 2.5 microM TC reduces by half the current peak evoked by 1 microM AcCho. The block by TC is independent of membrane voltage. By contrast, the block of AcCho-induced currents by Hex or Dec is strongly voltage dependent, suggesting that these substances enter the channel. The block by Mec is detectable at concentrations as low as 100 nM when applied together with 1 microM AcCho and is voltage independent. Hex, Dec, and Mec are effective only when AcCho is present. While the effects of all other agents are fully reversible, the Mec block is persistent.\r"

  ".U": "90175424\r", 
  ".W": "The sided effects of H+ on Ca2(+)-stimulated K+ transport (the Gardos channel) were studied in human red blood cells. Cells were loaded with Ca2+ during energy depletion with the internal pH adjusted to desired levels prior to treatment with the anion-exchange inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), which inhibits pH equilibration across the membrane. This treatment provides a \"pH clamp\" whereby the internal and external H+ (H+i and H+o) concentrations can be varied separately. Channel activity was evaluated by measuring either net K+ loss or unidirectional 42K+ efflux from cells where SO2(-4) replaced Cl- on both sides of the membrane. When pHi was set at 7.4, decreasing pHo from values of 8.0 to 5.0 inhibited K+ efflux. This effect of H+o could be overcome by increasing K+o at all values of pHo. In addition, this effect of K+o could be separated from its effects on altering the membrane potential, indicating an interaction between K+o and H+o on the channel. A similar interaction was shown to occur between H+i and K+i. K+o is known to be required for activation of Ca2(+)-stimulated K+ transport, since the channel in cells preincubated in the absence of K+o (prior to exposure to Ca+i) becomes refractory to subsequent activation by Ca2+i and K+o. We found that H+o would not substitute for K+o in this regard nor would H+o inhibit the protective effect of K+o; in addition, H+ was not transported inward in exchange for K+i. Thus it would appear that there are two external sites where K+o interacts with the channel. One site is antagonized by H+o, whereas the second site is required for channel activation independent of H+ in the range studied. The inside of the channel would have, by an analogous argument, at least one site where K+i and H+i interact.\r"

  ".U": "90175425\r", 
  ".W": "Isoelectric focusing of the Mr 34,000 pregnenolone-binding protein (PBP) isolated from the guinea pig adrenal cortex has revealed multiple charge isoforms. Alkaline phosphatase treatment resulted in the disappearance of the pI 5.4 isoform associated with the appearance of pI 5.9 and pI 6.1 isoforms; this alteration in the charge-isoform pattern of the PBP correlated with a loss in pregnenolone-binding activity. This finding appears to be novel for intracellular steroid-binding proteins and has not been demonstrated for steroid receptors, a well-studied group of phosphoproteins. Resolution of the PBP by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis produced two radioactive peaks of [3H]pregnenolone in an equilibrium system, while only one peak was present in a nonequilibrium system, suggesting high- and low-binding affinity forms of PBP. Isoelectric focusing of highly purified PBP resolved multiple forms of Mr 34,000 proteins with pI values ranging from 6.4 to 5.2. Two of the Mr 34,000 charge isoforms were isolated, and each was used to generate polyclonal antibodies; both antisera were crossreactive against all forms of Mr 34,000 PBP. Western blot analysis revealed that the PBP was present in both the fasciculata and reticularis of the adrenal cortex, though the isoform patterns were not identical for the two zones. Additionally, the pregnenolone-binding activity was approximately 10-fold greater in the zona reticularis. In vitro alkaline phosphatase treatment of the PBP abolished pregnenolone-binding activity and caused an alteration in the charge-isoform pattern for PBP in the zona reticularis, where pregnenolone binding is high, to resemble the pattern found for the zona fasciculata, where pregnenolone binding is low. The results indicate that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation regulates pregnenolone-binding activity and influences the pattern of the PBP isoformation. The data further suggest that the pI 5.4 isoform may be the active steroid-binding molecule.\r"

  ".U": "90175426\r", 
  ".W": "The adenovirus E4 gene encodes a trans-activating function that can stimulate the E2 promoter. E2 promoter sequences required for E4 trans-activation are identical to those required for E1A trans-activation, and these principally are the E2 promoter binding factor (E2F) binding sites. Furthermore, full activation of E2F DNA binding activity requires both E1A and E4 action. Analysis of a series of mutant E4 viruses identifies open reading frame (orf) 6/7 of the E4 transcription unit as that required for activation of E2F binding activity. In addition, the assay of various E4 cDNAs demonstrates that the E4 orf 6/7 also is responsible for the trans-activation of E2 transcription. Translation of the E4 orf 6/7 mRNA, but not a control mRNA, in a reticulocyte extract generates an activity that can stimulate cooperative binding of E2F in vitro, consistent with recent in vivo assays that demonstrate a role for the E4 gene in E2F stable complex formation. This stimulation is due to a direct interaction of the E4 protein with E2F since an antibody that recognizes the E4 orf 6/7 polypeptide detects this E4 protein in the E2F-DNA complex. We conclude that the E4 orf 6/7 product interacts with the E2F factor altering binding to allow formation of a stable complex that results in a stimulation of transcription.\r"

One class has the even sex ratio, and the other has equal allele frequencies in the two sexes. Equilibria of the second class may exhibit linkage disequilibrium. The condition for external stability of these second-class equilibria to invasion by a new allele is that the appropriately averaged sex ratio near the equilibrium be moved closer to the even sex ratio than the average among the resident genotypes. However, invasion by a new chromosome depends on the recombination fraction in a way that appears to preclude general results about the evolutionary genetic stability of the even sex ratio in this situation.\r"

MiHAgs are allelic forms of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted self-antigens recognized by cytotoxic T cells and usually are defined immunogenetically. Although structurally not identified as yet, it is assumed that MiHAgs are internal cell antigens that are processed and then presented by MHC class I proteins similar to viral antigens. To define a MiHAg both molecularly and functionally, we took advantage of the allelic difference of the structurally characterized intracellular myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx) and investigated its antigenicity. Skin grafts from congenic Mx+ mice carrying the functional Mx1 gene were rejected by mice lacking a functional Mx1 gene (Mx- mice). In parallel, cytotoxic MHC class I-restricted effector T cells specific for Mx protein and the H-2Kk antigen (but not for several other allelic H-2 antigens) were strongly induced in Mx- mice immunized with spleen cells from interferon-treated Mx+ mice. These data show that allelic forms of cell internal proteins presented by MHC class I may act as MiHAgs.\r"

  ".W": "Three distinct gene products, the alpha and beta chains of glycoprotein (GP) Ib and GP IX, constitute the platelet membrane GP Ib-IX complex, a receptor for von Willebrand factor and thrombin involved in platelet adhesion and aggregation. Defective function of the GP Ib-IX complex is the hallmark of a rare congenital bleeding disorder of still undefined pathogenesis, the Bernard-Soulier syndrome. We have analyzed the molecular basis of this disease in one patient in whom immunoblotting of solubilized platelets demonstrated absence of normal GP Ib alpha but presence of a smaller immunoreactive species. The truncated polypeptide was also present, along with normal protein, in platelets from the patient's mother and two of his four children. Genetic characterization identified a nucleotide transition changing the Trp-343 codon (TGG) to a nonsense codon (TGA). Such a mutation explains the origin of the smaller GP Ib alpha, which by lacking half of the sequence on the carboxyl-terminal side, including the trans-membrane domain, cannot be properly inserted in the platelet membrane. Both normal and mutant codons were found in the patient, suggesting that he is a compound heterozygote with a still unidentified defect in the other GP Ib alpha allele. Nonsense mutation and truncated GP Ib alpha polypeptide were found to cosegregate in four individuals through three generations and were associated with either Bernard-Soulier syndrome or carrier state phenotype. The molecular abnormality demonstrated in this family provides evidence that defective synthesis of GP Ib alpha alters the membrane expression of the GP Ib-IX complex and may be responsible for Bernard-Soulier syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The defensive tail-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia californica, mediated by identified sensory neurons in pleural ganglia that form synapses on motor cells in pedal ganglia, can be sensitized by stimulating the animal with electric shock. The neurophysiological basis of this simple form of learning is thought to be the increased release of transmitter by the sensory neurons. Earlier work has focused on cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation as the cause of the presynaptic facilitation underlying short-term sensitization. Using physiological concentrations of Mg2+ during fractionation, we now find that, independent from cAMP, protein kinase C is translocated in sensory neurons by sensitizing stimuli. Translocation occurred after behavioral training of the animal and after application to isolated ganglia of serotonin or phorbol esters. Taken together with the neurophysiological evidence presented in the accompanying paper that phorbol esters can produce the facilitation, these biochemical results suggest that protein kinase C plays a role in producing the presynaptic facilitation that underlies short-term sensitization and dishabituation of defensive reflexes.\r"

  ".U": "90175433\r", 
  ".W": "Presynaptic facilitation of transmitter release contributes to behavioral sensitization and dishabituation, two simple forms of learning in Aplysia. This enhancement of transmitter release can be simulated by the facilitatory transmitter serotonin and has been shown to result from two types of mechanisms. The first facilitating process involves broadening of the presynaptic action potential in the sensory neurons of the reflex and is maximally effective when the synapse has not been depressed by repeated stimulation, as during sensitization. The second process is independent of changes in spike duration and can enhance release even when the synapse is quite depressed, as during dishabituation. Earlier work suggests that the first process is mediated by an increase in the intracellular level of cyclic AMP in the sensory neurons. We show here that release of free cyclic AMP from a photolyzable analogue introduced into sensory neurons can enhance release even at depressed synapses, indicating that cyclic AMP can activate the second as well as the first process. In addition, we find that phorbol esters, activators of protein kinase C, enhance release at depressed synapses. This is consistent with the report in the accompanying paper [Sacktor, T. C. and Schwartz, J. H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 2036-2039] that serotonin and sensitizing stimuli translocate protein kinase C from cytoplasm to membrane. Our findings suggest that the cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation system can mediate more than one facilitatory process and that both cyclic AMP-dependent kinase and protein kinase C may be involved in facilitation of depressed synapses.\r"

Recombinant soluble human CD4 (rCD4) was tested for its ability to inhibit SIVagm, an HIV-like virus that naturally infects African green monkeys, in order to define T cell surface receptors critical for SIVagm infection. The rCD4 was found to enhance SIVagm infection of a human T cell line by as much as 18-fold, whereas HIV-1 infection was blocked by rCD4. Induction of syncytium formation and de novo protein synthesis were observed within the first 24 hours after SIVagm infection, whereas this process took 4 to 6 days in the absence of rCD4. This enhancing effect could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed to rCD4. The enhancing effect could be abrogated with antibodies from naturally infected African green monkeys with inhibitory titers of from 1:2,000 to 1:10,000; these antibodies did not neutralize SIVagm infection in the absence of rCD4. Viral enhancement of SIVagm infection by rCD4 may result from the modulation of the viral membrane through gp120-CD4 binding, thus facilitating secondary events involved in viral fusion and penetration.\r"

  ".W": "We review here the 10-year experience at the University of Michigan with 35 patients with gastrin hypersecretion who underwent transhepatic venous sampling (THVS) for tumor localization. Since 1978 THVS has been done routinely in all patients with gastrinoma syndrome considered for operation. Thirty-one patients had proved gastrinomas--21 benign sporadic tumors and 10 tumors associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type-I (MEN I) syndrome. The correlation between the site of the maximal gradient and location of a sporadic tumor was poor. Overall sensitivity was only 35%, specificity 89%, and negative predictive value 89%. If gradients were regionalized to three areas--body and tail, gastrinoma triangle, and hepatic lobes--then sensitivity was 94%, positive predictive value 94%, and specificity 97%, with a negative predictive value of 97%. The maximal gastrin gradient above the mean for other values gave the greatest sensitivity and specificity. In MEN I syndrome, only four of eight patients with macroadenomas had their tumors correctly localized, a sensitivity of 50% and specificity and negative predictive value of 75%. In 19 patients who had operative localization of sporadic gastrinoma, computed tomography had a sensitivity of 31%, specificity of 66%, positive predictive value of 83%, and negative predictive value of 15%. Selective angiography was better, with a sensitivity of 29%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 100%. Regionalization to the triangle proved valuable for detection of microgastrinomas, as was measurement of hepatic vein gastrins for identification of intrahepatic tumors. In MEN I syndrome, if regionalization was achieved (50%), tumor resection appeared to offer hope of \"cure.\" We conclude that THVS is the best tool for tumor regionalization to the pancreatic tail and body, gastrinoma triangle, and hepatic lobes. It has allowed us to achieve surgical cure in 19 of 21 patients with sporadic gastrinomas and improvement in four of eight patients with MEN I syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The outcome of 29 patients who underwent lung resection for treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma from January 1976 to November 1988 was studied. Twenty-two patients underwent total resection for cure of all apparent metastatic disease, whereas seven patients did not undergo total resection. Of the 22 patients who underwent curative resection, the median survival was 11 months, with a 2-year survival of 13.6% and a 5-year survival of 4.5%. Four patients who underwent curative resection are currently alive and free of disease, with one patient surviving more than 10 years. The patients who underwent palliative resection had a median survival of 5 months, only one patient living longer than 10 months. The difference in survival of the patients who underwent curative resection compared with palliative resection was statistically significant. The thickness of the primary cutaneous malignant melanoma, the presence of regional lymph node metastases, the disease-free interval from primary diagnosis to metastatic pulmonary disease, and whether one or two metastatic nodules were removed during curative lung resection were not statistically significant in altering survival. These results demonstrate that although prolonged survival for metastatic melanoma is rare, lung resection in selected patients may be associated with long-term survival.\r"

Lymph node metastasis was also evaluated by DNA content and mitotic rate. According to the linear regression analysis, there were statistically significant correlations of mitotic rate with DNA variants such as the peak value, the mean value, and the frequency of cells with values exceeding tetraploid or hexaploid chromosome complement. There were significantly higher values for these DNA parameters in patients with lymph node metastasis compared with those without metastasis. Similarly, higher mitotic rates were observed in tumors with metastatic disease. Thus abnormal DNA fractions appear to be indicative of tumors with a high mitotic activity. The quantitative detection of the DNA abnormalities will provide pertinent biologic information required to predict the occurrence of metastasis in patients with gastric cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The role of emergency endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (NBD) in the management of severe acute cholangitis was evaluated by comparing the outcome of 15 patients who underwent the procedure as an initial treatment with that of 20 patients who underwent emergency surgery. Biliary sepsis was successfully controlled without complication in all 15 patients by the insertion of a 7F nasobiliary catheter through a limited papillotomy. Subsequent definitive elective treatment included endoscopic stone clearance (n = 6), common duct exploration (n = 8), and bili-enteric reconstruction (n = 1). Among the 20 patients who had surgical treatment, cholecystectomy (n = 11), cholecystostomy (n = 1), and transhepatic intubation (n = 1) were done in addition to common duct exploration. Although patients undergoing endoscopic NBD were significantly older (75.3 years vs 60.1 years; p less than 0.05) and more jaundiced (total bilirubin, 120.3 mmol/L vs 70.4 mmol/L; p less than 0.05), comparable morbidity (40% vs 65%) and mortality (6.7% vs 20%) was observed. Initial endoscopic NBD provides a safe and effective therapeutic option for the management of fulminant biliary sepsis. Among patients with complicated ductal anatomy, endoscopic NBD should first be attempted because, when successful, definitive reconstruction may be performed on an elective basis. The value of its routine application for all patients, however, remains to be validated by further clinical studies.\r"

Two ZES patients had undergone total gastrectomy, and the third had undergone subtotal gastrectomy before our study. A significant increase in plasma gastrin, from 23 +/- 5 pg/ml to 53 +/- 20 pg/ml, in response to intravenous epinephrine (40 ng/kg.min), was observed in the normal subjects. This response was completely abolished by beta-blockade. In the ZES patients, epinephrine (40 ng/kg.min) also resulted in an increase in the plasma concentration of gastrin. The basal and maximum concentrations of gastrin were 580 and 1680 pg/ml in patient 1, 145000 and 320000 pg/ml in patient 2, and 200 and 1800 pg/ml in patient 3, respectively. beta-Adrenergic blockade suppressed the epinephrine-stimulated gastrin release in these patients as well. Graded intravenous doses of epinephrine given to the ZES patients resulted in elevation of the plasma gastrin in a dose-dependent manner. Insulin hypoglycemia caused an increase in both plasma epinephrine and plasma gastrin in ZES patients and normal subjects. A significant correlation between plasma gastrin and epinephrine during insulin hypoglycemia was observed in both groups. Exercise, with use of a bicycle ergometer, resulted in an increase in plasma epinephrine. An increase in plasma gastrin with exercise was observed in the ZES patients, and this was also suppressed by beta-blockade. The results suggest that gastrinoma cells, like normal G cells, are equipped with beta-adrenergic receptors that regulate gastrin release.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the tolerance limit of the liver in the critically suppressed mitochondrial oxidation-reduction state, the arterial ketone body ratio (acetoacetate/3-hydroxybutyrate), which reflects hepatic mitochondrial oxidation-reduction potential, was measured 1319 times in 161 patients during the postoperative critical period. Because patients who showed arterial ketone body ratios between 0.40 and 0.25 had a higher incidence of postoperative complications than had those who showed ratios above 0.40, this was designated as the critical zone of the arterial ketone body ratio. When duration in the critical zone was less than 2 days, 90% of the patients were able to tolerate the condition and survive. By contrast, when an arterial ketone body ratio below 0.40 was prolonged for more than 5 days, there was a high incidence of multiple organ failure and a 100% mortality rate, with the average survival period after a 5-day suppression being estimated as 5.7 +/- 2.4 days. It is suggested that the arterial ketone body ratio in the critical zone must be returned to normal values within 2 days to obtain a good prognosis.\r"

Flow was determined according to two different indicators and three methods of analysis including indocyanine green dye clearance (HBFICG), galactose clearance (GC), and galactose clearance with splanchnic galactose gradient measurement (HBFGG). For normal subjects, these three analytic methods provided essentially identical results (HBFICG = 0.74 +/- 0.18, GC = 0.72 +/- 0.14, and HBFGG = 0.76 +/- 0.16 L/min-m2). With hepatic venous sampling, HBF in patients with sepsis was significantly higher than normal levels (HBFICG = 1.28 +/- 0.50 and HBFGG = 1.17 +/- 0.52 L/min-m2) (p less than 0.025), but HBF by the GC technique (0.89 +/- 0.41 L/min-m2), which uses peripheral venous sampling, was not significantly increased because of reduced splanchnic galactose extraction, which appears to be characteristic of sepsis. Thus HBF estimates based on peripheral venous sampling must be interpreted with caution in view of the reduced extraction fraction in sepsis. HBF in clinical sepsis tends to increase in response to this inflammatory stress.\r"

We studied cholecystokinin-stimulated pancreatic secretion in conscious rats before and after inducing acute pancreatitis with supramaximal administration of caerulein--5 micrograms/kg/hr intravenously for 6 hours. Marked hyperamylasemia developed in all rats immediately after administration of caerulein. Basal and cholecystokinin-stimulated pancreatic juice flow and protein (enzyme) secretion decreased significantly 24 hours after acute pancreatitis was induced even though plasma amylase returned to basal levels. We conclude that acute pancreatitis markedly impairs pancreatic secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Glutamine and alanine are dominant nitrogen carriers from skeletal muscle stores to splanchnic organs. In addition, these amino acids may also serve as a primary energy source for the gastrointestinal tract during injury. To investigate these contributions, we studied extremity amino acid efflux during hypocaloric dextrose feedings and during total parenteral nutrition in a population of normal volunteers (NL VOL) (n = 9), a group of patients with sepsis who had undergone laparotomy without bowel resection and were in the intensive care unit (ICU) (n = 7), and patients with sepsis after laparotomy (PT) (n = 2) who had recently undergone greater than 80% bowel resection. Circulating alanine and glutamine levels were significantly lower in the patients compared with NL VOL under both feeding conditions. The peripheral output of alanine was higher in the ICU group than in the NL VOL during hypocaloric feedings. Glutamine efflux, however, was independent of either the counterregulatory hormone or substrate background. By contrast, enterectomy was associated with a marked decrease of extremity glutamine efflux compared with NL VOL or the ICU patients who did not undergo enterectomy (-62 +/- 9 nmol/min/dl tissue in the PT vs -265 +/- 32 nmol/min/dl tissue in the NL VOL and -311 +/- 58 nmol/min/dl tissue in the ICU group) during the dextrose feedings; this difference persisted during subsequent total parenteral nutrition (+12 +/- 13 nmol/min/dl tissue in PT vs -178 +/- 56 nmol/min/dl tissue in the NL VOL and -287 +/- 81 nmol/min/dl tissue in the ICU group). These data suggest that distinct mechanisms regulate peripheral alanine and glutamine balance and that the gastrointestinal tract provides a feedback signal to peripheral tissues to maintain glutamine mobilization under both nonstressed and stressed conditions.\r"

It has been postulated but never demonstrated that a cutaneous thermal injury will result in increased small-intestinal permeability. In a standardized 20% body surface area full-thickness scald injury, with polyethylene glycol 3350 and horseradish peroxidase used as permeability probes, small-intestinal permeability was examined regionally in an everted intestinal sac model. In the normal animals, the upper (proximal) and lower (distal) small intestine were less permeable to these probes than the middle segment. Within 6 hours after the injury, an increase in the mucosal uptake and transmural permeability was seen in all three small-intestinal segments; the most dramatic increase in permeability occurred in the ileum, p less than 0.01. The maximum increase in permeability was seen at 18 hours, and permeability was normal by 72 hours after the injury. This increase in intestinal permeability may represent a transient failure of the intestinal barrier function and may allow absorption of potentially toxic macromolecules from the intestinal lumen into the portal circulation early after thermal injury. Absorption of these macromolecules, such as endotoxin, may be potentially harmful by direct toxic actions or potentially helpful by activation of the immune system.\r"

We studied risk factor profiles in a series of 102 consecutive patients with a lacunar infarct and 202 consecutive patients with a carotid artery-distribution infarct involving the cortex registered in the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project, a community-based study of first-ever stroke. The two groups did not differ in the prevalence of prestroke hypertension (defined in a number of ways) or in the prevalence of markers of sustained hypertension. The presence of atrial fibrillation and a history of myocardial infarction, particularly during the 6 weeks before the stroke, were significantly more common in the group with carotid-distribution infarcts involving the cortex. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of other accepted risk factors for ischemic stroke, including previous transient ischemic attack, cervical bruit, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, or cigarette smoking. Our results suggest that hypertension is no more important in the development of lacunar infarction than it is in the development of other types of ischemic stroke that are presumed to be due to atherosclerotic thromboembolism in a major cerebral artery. Our data support the autopsy evidence that cardioembolic occlusion is an unusual cause of lacunar infarction.\r"

This group comprised 8.5% of patients of all ages admitted for stroke, 2.3 times the proportion observed in the National Survey of Stroke. Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed in 46 young patients (41%); the main causes included aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, hypertension, and tumors. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was found in 19 young patients (17%); the majority were due to aneurysms. The remaining 48 young patients (42%) had cerebral infarction, the majority due to cardiogenic emboli and premature atherosclerosis. Mitral valve prolapse, the use of oral contraceptives, alcohol drinking, and migraine were infrequent sole causes of cerebral infarction in the absence of other risk factors. The case-fatality rate for this group of young patients with stroke was 20.4% compared with 23.9% for the National Survey of Stroke. Young adults with stroke deserve an extensive but tailored evaluation, which should include angiography and echocardiography.\r"

The autopsy material from the years 1925 to 1985 was analyzed to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke. The incidence of stroke was 198.3 per 100,000 inhabitants greater than 20 years of age. Mortality from cerebrovascular disease decreased significantly in both males and females from 1977 to 1985. Analysis of the pattern of cerebrovascular disease in the autopsy material from 1925 to 1965 demonstrated an overwhelming percentage of hemorrhagic stroke. In the years that followed, an inversion was noticed in the ratio of ischemic to hemorrhagic stroke. It should be assumed that the growing efficacy of antihypertensive therapy largely explains the decreasing incidence of stroke-induced mortality.\r"

New neurologic symptoms developed in four survivors (4%) and symptoms of cardiac ischemia in six (6%). No survivor who developed new cerebrovascular symptoms showed progression of carotid disease. These data provide useful elements for a rational approach to prevention of the atherosclerotic complications of hypertension.\r"

On the contrary, fibrinopeptide A levels had no prognostic significance among the nine patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Concentrations of beta-thromboglobulin, an index of platelet activation, were higher in the 27 stroke patients than in the 40 controls, but this index was not associated with stroke recurrence. Fibrinogen levels were not significantly higher in stroke patients than in controls. In a multivariate regression analysis of hemostatic and clinical variables, only fibrinopeptide A levels of greater than 4 ng/ml were significantly related to cerebral infarction. Our results support the role of hypercoagulability in the recurrence of ischemic stroke and may allow identification of subjects at high risk for it. If confirmed in more patients, our results could provide a rationale for clinical trials of anticoagulant therapy in such patients.\r"

Cerebral blood flow was measured using xenon-133, the electroencephalogram was recorded using silver-silver chloride epidural electrodes, and histologic examination was carried out after perfusion-fixation. In the baboons subjected to hypotension alone (mean arterial blood pressure of 28 mm Hg) cerebral blood flow was 28.5 +/- 5.0 ml/100 g/min, whereas in the baboons subjected to hypotension plus unilateral carotid artery occlusion it was 21.8 +/- 1.8 ml/100 g/min at a mean arterial blood pressure of 27 mm Hg. There was no ischemic damage in the former group, but in the latter group there was necrosis in the arterial boundary zones of three baboons and in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery in one. We conclude that, when combined with hypotension, unilateral carotid artery occlusion may lead to hemodynamic ischemia accentuated in the arterial boundary zones of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere.\r"

One to 4 days later, a closed cranial window was placed over the parietal cortex and baseline pial arteriolar responses and responses to topical application of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine (10(-6) and 10(-4) M) and acetylcholine (10(-4) M) were determined. We also sampled cerebrospinal fluid from under the window during baseline conditions and during application of the neurotransmitters, and we measured the concentrations of prostanoids (6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and prostaglandin E2) via radioimmunoassay. Pial arterioles in the chronic control group (n = 13) constricted by 20 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) in response to 10(-4) M norepinephrine and by 28 +/- 2% in response to 10(-4) M acetylcholine. In the chronic blood group (n = 14), pial arterioles did not constrict significantly in response to 10(-4) M norepinephrine but constricted normally (23 +/- 4%) in response to 10(-4) M acetylcholine.

We studied the effect of hyperglycemia on neuropathologic changes in a rabbit model of focal cerebral ischemia. Rabbits were randomized to receive saline (n = 12) or glucose (n = 12) infusions. The left anterior cerebral and left internal carotid arteries were clipped after the infusion began. After 6 hours of occlusion, the area of severe ischemic neuronal damage in the left neocortex and striatum on two standard sections of brain was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total area of the left cortex or striatum. The mean +/- SEM cortical area of severe ischemic neuronal damage was 22.1 +/- 2.8% in the glucose-treated rabbits and 34.0 +/- 4.6% in the saline-treated rabbits (p less than 0.05). The cortical area of severe ischemic neuronal damage was inversely correlated with plasma glucose concentration at the time of arterial clipping (p less than 0.05). We conclude that hyperglycemia is associated with decreased histologic neuronal injury in this model of focal cerebral ischemia and may be protective when cerebral ischemia occurs from a focal insult.\r"

Eicosanoids also modulate cerebrovascular tone under normal physiologic circumstances, but a similar role for platelet activating factor has not been investigated. Therefore, using 16 rats, we studied the effects of the platelet activating factor receptor blockers BN 52021 (10 mg/kg, n = 4 or 30 mg/kg, n = 2) and WEB 2086 (5 mg/kg, n = 6) on global cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen and compared them with the effect of indomethacin (10 mg/kg, n = 4). Neither antagonist altered cerebral blood flow (112 +/- 16 and 107 +/- 14 ml/100 g/min at baseline versus 108 +/- 16 and 105 +/- 18 ml/100 g/min after BN 52021 and WEB 2086, respectively). In contrast, indomethacin significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased cerebral blood flow from 106 +/- 8 to 69 +/- 4 ml/100 g/min. No treatment altered the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen compared with baseline. These data suggest that in normal rat brain, concentrations of platelet activating factor, unlike those of eicosanoids, are subthreshold and do not modulate cerebral blood flow or the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen.\r"

The middle cerebral artery of 21 Sprague-Dawley rats was occluded with a snare ligature for 1, 2, or 6 hours followed by 5, 4, or 0 hours of reflow, respectively (seven rats in each group). All animals were injected with neutral red for visual confirmation that the affected regions were reperfused. The brains were frozen in situ, and the concentrations of adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, glycogen, and lactate were determined in those areas corresponding to the normally perfused medial ipsilateral cortex, the perifocal region, and the ischemic focus. Values for the 6 hours' occlusion with no reflow group served as a control to demonstrate restoration of metabolite concentrations. In both groups with reflow, the levels of high-energy phosphates were greater than control, but this effect of reflow was primarily significant for the group with 1 hour's occlusion (p less than 0.05). The levels of glycogen and lactate provided additional evidence that the extent of metabolite restoration was graded; following 2 hours of occlusion, metabolite recovery was compromised (p less than 0.05). Our data strongly support the concept that the window of opportunity for effective treatment of focal ischemia by reperfusion is narrow (of short duration).\r"

Echocardiography in 12 patients demonstrated vegetations in one. Among the 20 patients, neurologic complications occurred in eight (40%), six of whom had mechanical valves (five mitral and one aortic). Infection with Staphylococcus aureus occurred in four of the eight patients (50%) with neurologic complications. Of the eight patients with neurologic complications, ischemic stroke was diagnosed in four, transient ischemic attacks in one, and intracranial hemorrhage in three. Prothrombin times at the time of the intracranial hemorrhage were 2.2, 1.5, and 1.3 times control in these three patients. Cerebral angiography done in four of the eight patients with neurologic complications failed to show mycotic aneurysms. Nine of the 20 patients (seven men and two women, mean age 66.8 years) died less than or equal to 90 days after the diagnosis of late prosthetic valve endocarditis. Half of the eight patients with neurologic complications died (three men and one woman, mean age 62.3 years), and all three patients with intracranial hemorrhage died. Our data suggest that the neurologic complications of late prosthetic valve endocarditis are more common with mechanical valves, particularly in the mitral position, and are associated with a high mortality.\r"

We describe a patient with fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage presumably caused by beta protein-type cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which was demonstrated immunohistochemically by using a monoclonal antibody to a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 8-17 of beta protein.

To determine whether such associations occur in nonreferred and unselected women with mitral valve prolapse, we measured blood pressure, heart rate, and norepinephrine response to standing in 13 volunteers with mitral valve prolapse and in 11 control subjects. Platelet alpha-adrenergic receptor quantity and affinity on standing also were determined in all persons. No significant differences were found between the groups in any of these measurements. Although small subsets of women with mitral valve prolapse may indeed have associated neuroendocrine epiphenomena and autonomic dysfunction, it is probably incorrect to generalize these findings to the vast spectrum of those with mitral valve prolapse.\r"

Human and animal birth defects have been associated with the use of the vitamin A analogue, isotretinoin, or Accutane, for acne treatment, although the association of such defects with vitamin A itself is unclear. The federal Food and Drug Administration is evaluating the health issues surrounding vitamin A and, together with the manufacturer, has developed restrictions and label warnings to ensure the appropriate use of Accutane. We also have evaluated these issues, with concerns about the possible teratogenicity of high vitamin A intake during pregnancy. Practitioners should be familiar with the possible hazard of excessive dosages of vitamin A and its analogues. Vitamin A daily doses of higher than 8,000 IU for pregnant woman are not necessary for good health and are not recommended. Foods high in beta-carotene can provide the necessary amounts of vitamin A and, in contrast to the synthetic analogues, their use has not been associated with vitamin A toxicity or teratogenicity in humans or animals.\r"

The study was designed so that normal learning would minimize any deterioration in the post-on-call test performance. Statistically significant deterioration occurred in 3 of the 4 tests after a night on call. Even physicians acclimated to sleep deprivation on a regular, every-third-or-fourth-night basis showed functional impairment. The results have implications for patient care under conditions where house staff are stressed by sleep deprivation and prolonged fatigue.\r"

Serum samples were collected before and for 24 hours after each aminophylline dose. Theophylline serum concentrations were determined using the Abbott TDx automated immunoassay system. Theophylline and its 1,3-dimethyluric acid metabolite were measured in 24-hour urine collections. Serum theophylline concentration versus time curves were plotted and pharmacokinetic parameters determined for each subject. None of the derived parameters differed as a result of piroxicam exposure. Theophylline metabolites, clearance, half-life, and volume of distribution were compared during the baseline and piroxicam phases and were found to be similar. It was concluded that piroxicam does not alter the clearance, distribution, volume, or metabolism of theophylline in healthy adult volunteers.\r"

No elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, or bilirubin was detected in the aminoglycoside and control groups. Alkaline phosphatase increased significantly in the aminoglycoside group (average elevation of 28 +/- 16 units/L on day 6), but no patient had an elevation greater than twice the upper limit of the normal range. We conclude that the abnormality in liver enzymes during aminoglycoside therapy is a mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase, probably with no clinical significance.\r"

Rare but severe skin reactions can occur and include the Stevens-Johnson syndrome and exfoliative dermatitis. Dermal reactions appear to be the most commonly reported adverse effect in children. Drug continuance following the development of a mild skin rash may be associated with the development of a more severe dermal reaction. This report summarizes a case involving a six-year-old white girl who developed exfoliative dermatitis confined to the feet following a course of oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for otitis media. Exfoliation is an uncommon cutaneous manifestation following sulfonamide use. Although usually a generalized process, it is unusual to find it confined to the feet. Unfortunately there is no useful diagnostic method that could specifically elucidate the cause of a dermatologic eruption. Available evidence suggest that TMP/SMX was the probable cause of our patient's rash. Adjunctive antihistamines and corticosteroids are often useful when pruritus is present. Severe reactions require vigorous supportive treatment.\r"

We have begun to examine the prevalence of chronic adverse effects and their effect on compliance using a pilot study of self-reported NAEs, antipsychotic drugs, and compliance patterns in a naturalistic setting. Twenty chronic psychiatric outpatients who had been continuously prescribed antipsychotic agents for a minimum of six months were interviewed. The major finding is the greater antipsychotic dose exposure among those with self-reported NAEs compared with those without NAEs (781 +/- 606 chlorpromazine-equivalent mg/d vs. 125 +/- 117, p less than 0.001). High-potency agents were prescribed for all of the patients reporting amenorrhea and/or galactorrhea, although the relationship between potency group (high vs. low) and total neuroendocrine effects was not significant. Self-reported compliance was not significantly related to neuroendocrine adverse effects. However, a trend toward the association of self-reported galactorrhea and noncompliance (p = 0.08) is noted. The implications of these findings and a suggested approach for their replication in a more powerful statistical analysis is discussed.\r"

The clinical pharmacist reviewed the culture and sensitivity data and the pattern of infectious disease over the six-month period prior to the initiation of the study and prepared a list of the most appropriate antibiotics based on clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness. He then joined the physicians on morning rounds to monitor therapy and help in the selection of the most appropriate drug regimen.

  ".W": "Accelerated atherosclerosis occurs in chronic renal failure. The role of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in chronic renal failure patients requiring dialysis has not been characterized. We studied 17 chronic dialysis patients requiring PTCA over a 6-year period. Their mean age was 60 years, four were diabetic, eight had severe hypertension, and seven had unstable angina. Angiographic success was achieved in 47 of 49 (96%) stenoses attempted, including multivessel PTCA in 12 patients. There was one procedural death, two non-Q wave myocardial infarctions following PTCA, and one additional in-hospital noncardiac death. The 15 survivors were asymptomatic on discharge (mean stay 11 days), but recurrent angina developed within 6 months in 12 patients. Angiography in 11 of these 12 patients demonstrated restenosis of 26 of 32 (81%) dilated sites. Repeat PTCA in six patients was followed by return of angina in four patients with restenosis in 11 of 12 sites. Bypass surgery was ultimately performed in four patients with long-term angina relief. During follow-up (mean 20 months), seven patients died (five from chronic renal failure, two cardiac deaths). Thus although PTCA in chronic dialysis patients is technically feasible and provides relief of angina, aggressive restenosis limits the long-term benefit. Coronary bypass surgery may be the preferred therapy for this unique patient group.\r"

Theoretically, such changes may be due to reversible or irreversible myocardial ischemia. Whether similar ST elevations can be recorded in patients with myocardial ischemia without infarction is unknown. To clarify this, right chest leads V3R to V7R were recorded during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 43 patients who had a total of 45 arteries dilated. Balloon occlusion of the right coronary artery caused transient ST elevation, whereas closure of the left anterior descending coronary artery or the left circumflex artery was associated with transient ST depression. These findings were 100% discriminative in leads V5R and V6R. Furthermore, ST elevation greater than or equal to 1 mm in one or more of leads V4R to V7R was seen only when the right coronary artery was occluded. Thus transient myocardial ischemia without infarction may cause ST elevation in the right chest leads and ST elevation greater than or equal to 1 mm in one or more leads V4R to V7R is seen exclusively with occlusion of the right coronary artery.\r"

This study documents rates of hospitalization, use of various treatment options, a case fatality in the state of Massachusetts during 4 of the first 5 years of this decade (1980, 1982, 1983, and 1984). The data base was that of the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium (MHDC), covering all hospital discharges in the state, a total of 3.8 million discharge records for this period. Of these, about 190,000 (5%) fell into two active symptomatic categories of CHD: chronic active coronary disease (CACD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Total hospitalization rate for these CHD categories increased by 17%; this was due both to an increased rate of hospital transfers (or readmissions) and to a larger cohort of patients under care. The case fatality rate for hospitalized CHD decreased approximately 16%, from 9.7% (1980) to 8.1% (1984). In CACD the frequency of coronary angiography (CA) rose; the use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) increased much faster than the rate of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with a resultant increase in PTCA as a fraction of total interventions. Similar findings were recorded for AMI, but with much more marked changes, the total intervention rate increasing almost twenty-fold from 1980 to 1984. The statewide mortality rate for hospitalized CHD patients remained essentially unchanged at 71 to 74 hospital deaths per 100,000 population.\r"

Vital status information was available at a mean of 86 weeks for the cohort as a whole, and 94 deaths were recorded. As noted in other angiographic series that included blacks, a high proportion of patients in this study had unobstructed coronary arteries (41%), and there was a preponderance of women (56%). Hypertension was present in 82% of the cases, whereas 68% of the sample had left ventricular hypertrophy as revealed by echocardiogram. The cumulative proportion of patients who were surviving at 5 years was 90 +/- 1 (+/- SEM), 79 +/- 4, and 70 +/- 4 for patients with no obstructive lesions, one-vessel disease, and multivessel disease, respectively. The survival rate at 3 years for patients who had undergone bypass surgery (N = 152) was only 82% (+/- 5%). Noninvasive univariate predictors of mortality included male sex, history of myocardial infarction, Q waves on electrocardiogram, exercise duration on treadmill stress testing, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Angiographic predictors included left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, the number of diseased coronary vessels, ejection fraction, and mean pulmonary artery pressure. Regression analysis showed an independent association for all the angiographic variables noted previously as well as for echocardiographically determined left ventricular hypertrophy. Survival rates for blacks with coronary artery disease in this series were considerably lower than those currently reported for whites, particularly for patients who underwent coronary bypass grafting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Coronary arterial diameter was measured by sonomicrometry proximal to the stenosis-producing hydraulic occluder so that the effects of a post-stenotic pressure drop were excluded. With no stenosis, heart rate increased (116 +/- 7 to 183 +/- 10 beats/min, p less than 0.001), aortic pressure increased (97 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 5 mm Hg. p less than 0.005), circumflex coronary blood flow increased (48 +/- 8 to 72 +/- 8 ml/min, p less than 0.001), and circumflex coronary diameter increased (3.82 +/- 0.29 to 3.93 +/- 0.27 mm, p less than 0.01). In the presence of a flow-limiting stenosis, heart rate increased (120 +/- 6 to 176 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.001), aortic pressure did not change significantly (95 +/- 4 to 92 +/- 4 mm Hg), circumflex coronary blood flow increased slightly (39 +/- 8 to 46 +/- 9 ml/min, p less than 0.005), and circumflex coronary arterial diameter did not change significantly (3.78 +/- 0.29 to 3.80 +/- 0.28 mm). The stenosis prevented the increase in aortic pressure, blunted the increase in circumflex coronary blood flow (24 +/- 4 versus 7 +/- 2 ml/min, p less than 0.005), and prevented the increase in circumflex coronary arterial diameter. Therefore normal coronary arteries dilated during exercise and a flow-limiting stenosis prevented exercise-induced coronary dilation proximal to the stenosis, possibly due to both the failure of aortic pressure to increase and less flow-induced endothelium-dependent dilation.\r"

A reduction in ST segment elevation by greater than or equal to 35% of the peak value of ST segment elevation within the initial 6 hours was used as an indirect indicator for early reperfusion of the infarct-related artery (IRA). IRA patency and collateral circulation were assessed by coronary arteriography performed at 1 month. LV volumes increased in patients with a persistent ST segment elevation within the initial 6 hours of infarction and in those with a totally occluded IRA without collaterals. However, LV volumes were unchanged in patients with early reperfusion and in those who had subtotally occluded IRA or who had collateral circulation. LV dilation (greater than or equal to 20% increase in end-diastolic volume) occurred less often when early reperfusion and angiographically patent IRA or collateral supply to the infarct zone were present. This prospective study indicates that residual flow to the infarct region may exert a beneficial effect on LV volume changes after acute MI.\r"

Acidified NaNO2 (12.5 mmol/kg/hr) was infused intravenously in cats starting 0.5 hour after occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, which was reperfused 1.5 hour following occlusion. Significantly lower plasma creatine phosphokinase activities were observed at all times beyond 3 hours for MI cats given NaNO2 + hSOD when compared with the other MI groups. The areas-at-risk expressed as percentages of the total left ventricular weights were not significantly different among any of the MI groups. However, the necrotic area expressed as a percentage of the myocardial area-at-risk was significantly lower in the MI + NaNO2 + hSOD-treated cats compared with all other MI groups. The NaNO2-treated group also produced a significant decrease in the necrotic area relative to the area-at-risk. Cardiac myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities indicated no significant difference in number of neutrophils attracted to the ischemic zone in the NaNO2 + hSOD-treated MI cats when compared with the other MI groups. Acidified NaNO2 + hSOD together exert significant protection on the myocardium subjected to ischemia and reperfusion injury. NaNO2 may act synergistically with hSOD to prolong the action of NO by scavenging free radicals that inactivate NO.\r"

  ".W": "Polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte activation is known to result in the production and release of oxygen free radicals and hypochlorous acid. Various clinical conditions are associated with PMN leukocyte stimulation. The present investigation deals with the effects of stimulated PMN leukocytes in the absence and in the presence of scavengers of oxygen free radicals (superoxide dismutase, catalase), hypochlorous acid quencher (methionine), and myeloperoxidase inhibitor (azide) on cardiac function and contractility; blood lactate, gases, and pH levels, blood and cardiac tissue malondialdehyde; and PMN leukocyte chemiluminescence activity in anesthetized dogs. Opsonised zymosan was used for stimulation of PMN leukocytes, and the effects were observed for 2 hours. The dogs were divided into four groups: group I, zymosan; group II, superoxide dismutase + catalase + zymosan; group III, methionine + zymosan; group IV, azide + methionine + zymosan. Zymosan produced a decrease in cardiac function and in indices of myocardial contractility and an increase in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. There was a decrease in blood pH and in PMN leukocyte chemiluminescense and an increase in the blood lactate and malondialdehyde. Superoxide dismutase plus catalase and methionine reduced the effect of zymosan on cardiac function and contractility and on blood malondialdehyde, lactate, and pH. The combination of azide and methionine did not prevent the deleterious effects of zymosan on cardiac function and contractility. Cardiac tissue malondialdehyde levels were lower in groups III and IV than in groups I and II which had values similar to each other. Methionine was superior to superoxide dismutase plus catalase in the prevention of the deleterious effects of PMN leukocyte stimulation on the various measured parameters. These results suggest that oxygen free radicals and hypochlorous acid are cardiac depressants and increase systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance in addition to causing tissue damage. Clinical situations with PMN stimulation may result in cardiac depression. The oxygen free radical scavenger and hypochlorous acid quencher may be beneficial in the counteraction of the deleterious effects of PMN leukocyte stimulation on the hemodynamic parameters and cellular integrity.\r"

One third of the patients showed an inconsistency between scintigraphic ischemia and ischemia ST depression. Age, sex, prior myocardial infarction, and diabetes mellitus were not related to SMI. Patients with SMI had less severe ischemia despite a higher peak double product compared to those with painful ischemia. Among 91 with prior myocardial infarction and exercise-induced ischemia, 51 with periinfarction ischemia had a higher frequency of SMI than did 14 with ischemia remote from the prior infarct zone despite similarities in the severity of ischemia. In conclusion, factors localized within ischemic myocardium such as less severe ischemia or adjacency to a prior infarct made SMI more prevalent.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty has been shown to be an effective means of reducing mitral valve gradient and increasing mitral valve area in patients with mitral stenosis. Most techniques currently employed for performing this procedure involve delivery of one or two balloon valvuloplasty catheters through the interatrial septum en route to the mitral valve orifice. To determine the morphology of the resultant atrial septal defect (ASD), particularly as a function of the technique employed, we performed a series of in vitro experiments designed to simulate a variety of technical approaches. Ninety-eight experiments in total were performed in 19 normal adult hearts obtained in the fresh, nonpreserved state at necropsy. Transseptal delivery and withdrawal of two conventional, elliptical balloon catheters through two, individual septostomy sites was found to produce the largest ASD (combined area of two defects = 21.4 +/- 2.2 mm2). The defect resulting from transseptal delivery and tandem withdrawal of two elliptical balloon catheters through a single septostomy site measured 14.8 +/- 1.1 mm2, significantly (p = 0.0043) smaller than that produced by two septostomies. Transseptal delivery and withdrawal of a single, segmentally inflating (Inoue) balloon catheter produced a defect of intermediate size (17.5 +/- 1.2 mm2). ASD size was exacerbated by improper balloon withdrawal compared with tandem withdrawal of two completely deflated balloon catheters. Simultaneous withdrawal of two completely deflated balloon catheters through the same septostomy site increased ASD size from 14.8 +/- 1.1 mm2 to 23.6 +/- 2.3 mm2 (p = 0.0004). Simultaneous withdrawal of two incompletely deflated balloon catheters further increased ASD size to 45.8 +/- 2.6 mm2 (p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study patient was first seen with paroxysmal tachycardias of normal QRS duration, complete right bundle branch block, and complete left bundle branch block. Electrophysiologic studies disclosed poor anterograde atrioventricular nodal conduction with a block proximal to His deflection that occurred at an atrial paced cycle length of 600 msec with no ventriculoatrial conduction. The tachycardias were inducible with two ventricular extrastimuli, had a His deflection that preceded each QRS complex and an HV interval identical to that during sinus rhythm, and revealed ventriculoatrial dissociation. Tachycardia with QRS patterns of right bundle branch block had a cycle 30 to 35 msec longer than tachycardias with either normal QRS duration or complete left bundle branch block. Tachycardias could be entrained by appropriate right ventricular pacing at rates slightly faster than the rate of tachycardia. Tachycardias could be terminated abruptly by an intravenous bolus of either adenosine triphosphate or verapamil.\r"

The location of the accessory pathway (AP) was determined by endocavitary electrophysiologic studies in all patients and the location was confirmed during intraoperative epicardial mapping in 28 of them. The ECGs were classified according to Gallagher's criteria and with Milstein's algorithm, whereas the VCGs were classified according to a new two-step algorithm. The presence of multiple accessory pathways and coexisting myocardial infarctions were major limitations in both the VCG and ECG classification procedures. In patients with a single accessory pathway, three AP localizations (right free ventricular wall, posterior, or left free ventricular wall) were identified with the first step of the VCG algorithm, with an overall sensitivity (96.5%), specificity (90.7%), and positive predictive values (80%) that were greater than those obtained with the ECG Milstein algorithm (77.1%, 91.5%, and 75%, respectively). The second step of the VCG algorithm made it possible to identify an AP location in one of the following sites: anterior right, lateral right, posterior right, posterior left, lateral left, or anterior left ventricle. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were greater for the second step of the VCG algorithm than for the ECG criteria proposed by Gallagher (43.6% versus 39.3%, 92.1% versus 87.4%, and 51.5% versus 33.3%, respectively). It was concluded that the VCG seems to be more specific and sensitive than the ECG in the identification of the preexcitation site and should be given preference in the initial evaluation of the WPW syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effects of radiofrequency energy applied in a bipolar fashion with single as compared with multiple sequential applications at the canine endocardium. In this closed-chest model, radiofrequency energy (750 kHz) was delivered between two adjacent poles of an electrode catheter. Single applications were performed at distinct sites in the left (n = 30) and right ventricles (n = 29) of 13 normal dogs. A multiple sequential technique, which enlarges the ablated endocardial surface, was applied in the left (n = 13) and right ventricles (n = 4) of seven normal dogs and six dogs with remote myocardial infarction. Single applications (199 +/- 200 joules) resulted in lesions with a volume of 0.12 +/- 0.06 cm3 (range 0.03 to 0.31 cm3) and an endocardial surface area of 0.29 +/- 0.15 cm2 (range 0.06 to 0.63 cm2). Changes at the catheter/tissue interface led to a rise in impedance, restricting further enlargement of the necrosis. Sequential delivery of radiofrequency energy between poles 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 of a quadripolar electrode catheter repeated 9 to 11 times in slightly different positions allowed a cumulative energy of 6571 +/- 3857 joules to be applied to the endocardium, resulting in a lesion volume of 0.84 +/- 0.38 cm3, with an endocardial lesion surface area of 3.7 +/- 1.2 cm2 (range 2.9 to 5.1 cm2). Histologically, all radiofrequency lesions were restricted to the endocardium/subendocardium with a small border zone of injury. Aggressive stimulation techniques did not induce ventricular tachycardia in any of the dogs before and 19 +/- 11.4 days after multiple sequential ablations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To study the physiologic role of human myocardial beta-2 adrenoceptors, the beta adrenoceptor subtype(s) involved in the effects of catecholamines in vitro on the force of contraction and in vivo on heart rate were characterized. In vitro on both isolated electrically driven right and left atrial and left papillary muscle preparations, isoprenaline and adrenaline caused positive inotropic effects via beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation. In the atria both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation increased contractile force to a maximum; in left papillary muscle, however, only beta-1 adrenoceptor stimulation maximally increased contractile force, whereas beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation caused only submaximal increases. Noradrenaline, on the other hand, caused a positive inotropic effect nearly exclusively via atrial and ventricular beta-1 adrenoceptor stimulation. In vivo in 10 healthy volunteers isoprenaline-induced tachycardia was antagonized with equal potency by the beta-2 adrenoceptor-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 and the beta-1 adrenoceptor-selective antagonist bisoprolol indicating that it is mediated by cardiac beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation to about the same degree. In contrast, exercise-induced tachycardia (that is mediated mainly by noradrenaline released from the neurons) was antagonized only by bisoprolol but not by ICI 118,551. It is concluded that in humans under normal physiologic conditions contractility and/or heart rate is regulated only by cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptors. In situations of stress, however, when large amounts of adrenaline are released from the adrenal medulla, stimulation of cardiac beta-2 adrenoceptors could contribute to additional increases in contractility, heart rate, or both.\r"

  ".U": "90177881\r", 
  ".W": "The relationship between transmitral Doppler blood flow velocities and atrial contribution to left ventricular (LV) filling was investigated in seven open-chest dogs. At LV filling pressures greater than 15 to 20 mm Hg, LV volume approaches a maximum. Thus we hypothesized that when LV pressure before the onset of atrial systole exceeds this level, the atrial contribution would decrease and the ratio between peak early (E) and atrial-induced (A) mitral velocities would increase. Atrial contribution was measured as LV diameter increase during atrial contraction expressed as a percentage of the total LV diameter change during diastole (sonomicrometry). When left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was progressively increased from 10 +/- 1 (mean +/- standard deviation) to 28 +/- 3 mm Hg by intravenous saline solution, the atrial contribution decreased from 34 +/- 14% to 8 +/- 10% (p less than 0.001). Concomitantly the A velocity decreased from 39 +/- 7 to 24 +/- 8 cm.sec-1 (p less than 0.01), and the E/A ratio increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 3.6 +/- 1.5 (p less than 0.001). The E/A ratio and the atrial contribution were constant until LVEDP exceeded 17 to 20 mm Hg, at which level marked changes in both parameters were noted. Thus when LV filling pressure was increased, the E/A ratio increased, indicating a filling shift towards early diastole. The reduced atrial contribution during increased preload was explained by the curvilinear shape of the LV pressure-volume curve. At markedly elevated filling pressures, near-maximum LV diameter was achieved before atrial contraction; hence the atrial contribution decreased and the E/A ratio increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To define the significance of laminar systolic tricuspid regurgitant (TR) flow, pulsed-wave and continuous-wave Doppler (PWD, CWD), and two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography (2-DE, M-mode) were performed in 68 patients with TR, which included five patients with tricuspid valvectomy. The pattern of TR flow (laminar versus turbulent), TR severity (the distance that the regurgitant flow extended into the right atrium [1+ to 4+ as measured by PWD]), the peak flow velocity of TR by CWD, the presence or absence and the amount of systolic tricuspid cusp separation by 2-DE, and the dimension of the right ventricle and the inferior vena cava by M-mode, were assessed. A laminar pattern of TR flow in systole was obtained in 21 patients, five of whom had undergone tricuspid valvectomy. Fourteen of 21 had visible tricuspid cusp separation in systole on 2-DE; of the seven who had no visible tricuspid cusp separation during systole, five had undergone tricuspid valvectomy. All 47 patients with a turbulent pattern of TR flow had no visible systolic tricuspid cusp separation. Severe 4+ TR was present in 14 of 21 (67%) patients with laminar TR flow and in 4 of 47 (9%) patients with turbulent TR flow (p less than 0.001). The peak flow velocity of TR in patients with laminar TR flow (2.0 +/- 0.7 m/sec) was lower (p less than 0.001) than in those with turbulent TR flow (3.1 +/- 0.7 m/sec).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Calcium antagonists are popular therapeutic agents in the treatment of systemic hypertension. Although these agents have similar antihypertensive efficacy, they have varied effects on left ventricular function at rest in hypertensive patients. The effect of different calcium antagonists on left ventricular function during exercise and on exercise performance in patients with hypertension, however, is less clear. Fifteen patients with essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure = 95 to 110 mm Hg) were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, single-blinded crossover study comparing nifedipine with verapamil for rest/exercise heart rate and blood pressure, exercise performance, and rest/exercise left ventricular function. Each drug was titrated to achieve resting diastolic pressures less than 90 mm Hg. All patients underwent maximal exercise testing and rest/exercise gated radionuclide ventriculography at the end of 3-week placebo, nifedipine, and verapamil treatment periods. Both calcium antagonists significantly reduced blood pressure at rest and during exercise compared with placebo. Neither calcium antagonist altered resting heart rate; however, both verapamil and nifedipine significantly reduced heart rate at maximal exercise. Verapamil but not nifedipine impaired left ventricular peak emptying rate and left ventricular peak filling rate during exercise but not at rest. Neither verapamil nor nifedipine, however, significantly altered rest or exercise global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared with placebo. There was a trend, however, for impairment in the LVEF response to exercise (delta LVEF) in the verapamil treatment group. Exercise capacity was not significantly altered by either calcium antagonist compared with placebo. Thus verapamil but not nifedipine impairs left ventricular function during exercise in hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
