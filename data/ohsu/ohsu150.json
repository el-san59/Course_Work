Acyclovir is the drug of choice in patients with infections due to herpes simplex viruses, including genital herpes, herpes encephalitis, and neonatal herpes, and infections due to varicella-zoster virus. Amantadine is the only drug currently available for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A, but an investigational drug, rimantadine, appears to be equally effective and less toxic than amantadine. Ribavirin is the most recently approved antiviral agent for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infections. Numerous antiviral drugs are being studied in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Although currently available drugs have improved our ability to manage a variety of viral illnesses, much needs to be learned about specific dosage guidelines based on the studies of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, potential adverse effects and viral resistance, and the role of combination therapy to optimize therapy.\r"

This review evaluates current, selected literature on antibiotic prophylaxis for colorectal surgery, presumptive antibiotic administration following penetrating abdominal trauma, and treatment of intraabdominal infections. Single-drug regimens with the newer, broad-spectrum agents are assessed and compared with combination regimens; specific regimens are recommended. Colorectal procedures require an antimicrobial agent with activity against both aerobes and anaerobes. Patients undergoing elective colorectal procedures can be adequately protected with an orally administered three-dose regimen of neomycin/erythromycin. Parenteral antibiotic administration is generally not necessary, but, cefoxitin is recommended for nonelective colorectal surgery. The risk of potential infectious complications following penetrating abdominal trauma without colonic perforation is less than with colonic perforation; however, antibiotic therapy that includes activity against aerobes and anaerobes is recommended for all types of penetrating abdominal trauma. Although cephalothin, cefamandole, or cefoxitin alone may be used in abdominal trauma without perforation of the colon, only cefoxitin is recommended as a single-drug alternative to the standard clindamycin/gentamicin regimen in trauma with colonic perforation. Single-drug therapy with cefoxitin or moxalactam can be used successfully as alternatives to the standard regimens of clindamycin/gentamicin or metronidazole/gentamicin in many patients with intraabdominal sepsis. Single-drug regimens reduce the risk of developing adverse effects and are cost-effective. However, if resistant organisms are suspected, or if the patient has been hospitalized for a prolonged period or has multiple organ failure, it may be necessary to supplement cefoxitin therapy with an antibiotic that will enhance coverage against gram-negative aerobes.\r"

It enhances respiration after both acute and chronic administration by acting as an agonist of peripheral chemoreceptors located on the carotid bodies. In comparison with traditional central-acting respiratory stimulants, almitrine has advantages of oral activity, prolonged duration of effect, and an improved adverse effect profile. Almitrine is generally well tolerated, with headache and minor gastrointestinal disturbances being the most frequently observed side effects. This investigational agent has been shown to increase arterial oxygen tension while decreasing arterial carbon dioxide tension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease both at rest and during exercise through increased ventilation and improved ventilation/perfusion matching. It may also prove useful in the treatment of nocturnal oxygen desaturation because of its ability to reduce the frequency and severity of nocturnal hypoxemia without impairing the quality of sleep. Additional research is needed to further define the role of almitrine in the relief of hypoxemia.\r"

Selection of one of the available slow-release potassium chloride formulations for inclusion in a hospital formulary or SMP exemplifies one of these therapeutic equivalency issues. To evaluate this issue, we studied 20 hypertensive adult patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/d to determine if there are significant differences between the administration of 24 mEq of Slow-K given as 8 mEq/tablet tid, and 30 mEq of K-Tab given as a 10 mEq/tablet tid. The study was conducted in a randomized, open-label, crossover design in which the two drug formulations of potassium chloride were compared over two four-week treatment periods. Results from this study indicate that 24 mEq of Slow-K and 30 mEq of K-Tab were equally effective in maintaining serum electrolyte concentrations, blood pressure measurements, and electrocardiogram evaluations within normal limits in all 20 hypertensive patients studied. Furthermore, no adverse effects were noted with either potassium chloride formulation, and patient acceptance, tolerability, and compliance to prescribed dosing regimens were similar for both products. Based on our findings, therefore, we conclude that 24 mEq of Slow-K and 30 mEq of K-Tab given three times daily as 8 mEq and 10 mEq tablets, respectively, are therapeutically equivalent.\r"

  ".W": "Islets of Langerhans consist of four major endocrine cell types assembled in a highly organized manner critical for their function. The molecular forces governing islet cellular architecture are not understood. We determined whether adult rat islet cells carry information necessary for orderly assembly. Dispersed cells from adult rat islets were maintained in static suspension culture for 6 days. During this time the cells reassociated to form numerous aggregates. These aggregates were approximately half the size of native islets with a commensurate reduction in DNA and insulin content. However, both cellular composition and organization were remarkably similar to that of adult rat islets, in which the beta-cells form a central core surrounded by a discontinuous mantle of non-beta-cells. Thus, immunoperoxidase staining showed that in the aggregates, just as in intact islets cultured in parallel, 26% of the cells were non-beta-cells and of these, 94% were clearly peripheral. Non-beta-cells were similarly found to be peripheral, with beta-cells located centrally, even when the ratio of non-beta-cells to beta-cells had been altered. This was achieved by sorting the two cell populations by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry, resulting in aggregates with 79% non-beta-cells and 21% beta-cells. Insulin release from the aggregates was stimulated approximately ninefold by raising glucose from 50 to 300 mg/dl, which was comparable to that found for intact islets. The spontaneous formation of isletlike aggregates displaying appropriate cellular architecture indicates that the signals (molecules) needed for such organization are intrinsic to islet cells and are still expressed by them in adult life.\r"

In our experiment, the underlying mechanisms of these reflexes were studied in conscious, freely moving rats bearing chronic catheters. A double-isotope technique was used to measure, under non-steady-state conditions, rates of total glucose appearance (total Ra), total glucose disappearance (Rd), gut glucose absorption (gut Ra), hepatic glucose production (HGP), and the metabolic clearance rate of glucose (MCRg). In random order, 1 wk apart, rats either spontaneously drank 1 ml of a 60% glucose solution or were given the same dose into the stomach via a chronic gastric catheter. Glycemia and insulinemia were lower when glucose was taken orally than when the same amount of the substrate was administered intragastrically. Total Ra after glucose administration was the same in both groups throughout the experiment. Despite lower insulin and glucose values, the increase in Rd was initially higher in the oral group than in the intragastric group. This was accompanied by initial higher MCRg values in the oral group than in animals that received the glucose load directly into their stomachs. We conclude that a series of reflexes elicited by oral glucose ingestion improve glucose tolerance by increasing the efficiency of glucose disposal in the early stages after a glucose load, with a smaller amount of insulin released.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of T-lymphocytes in the induction of insulitis and hyperglycemia in certain strains of mice treated with multiple subdiabetogenic doses of streptozocin has been a matter of controversy. To understand the role of T-lymphocytes, we treated thymectomized BALB/c ByJ mice with five daily doses of streptozocin (45 mg/kg) and determined the effect of treatment with monoclonal antibodies against T-lymphocyte subsets on the development of diabetes and insulitis. Hyperglycemia (mean glucose of 321 +/- 29 vs. 167 +/- 15 mg/dl in controls) and insulitis were induced in BALB/c ByJ mice given streptozocin. Thy1.2+, L3T4, and Lyt2+ cells were all identified within the islets of diabetic mice. There was a relative paucity of L3T4+ cells and an overabundance of Lyt2+ cells compared with the frequency of these cells found in lymphatic tissues or peripheral blood. Treatment with anti-L3T4 or anti-Lyt2 monoclonal antibodies caused a reduction in splenic T-lymphocyte subsets and attenuated the hyperglycemia to 212 +/- 14 and 197 +/- 16 mg/dl (P less than .001 and .01), respectively, compared with controls and prevented the insulitis induced by streptozocin. Our studies support the hypothesis that an immune response is important to the development of multi-low-dose streptozocin diabetes and indicate that treatment with monoclonal antibodies against the L3T4+ or Lyt2+ T-lymphocyte subsets can attenuate this process.\r"

Patients were studied during hyperglycemia and during normoglycemia, which was attained by Biostator-directed feedback insulin infusion. The experiments were performed in the fasted state and after a standardized breakfast. In IDDM (n = 6), basal levels of SLI were significantly higher than in nondiabetic subjects (n = 18). In IDDM, normalization of hyperglycemia was followed by a 40% decline in basal SLI (P less than .05). After the meal, SLI increased to the same absolute levels with or without feedback insulin treatment; however, the incremental response was 60% higher during feedback insulin treatment (P less than .05). Treatment also suppressed fasting and postprandial levels of glucagon, whereas gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) levels were unaltered. In four pancreatectomized patients, normoglycemia tended to lower plasma levels of SLI by 50% (P less than .1). After breakfast, an SLI response was noted during normoglycemia, whereas no significant effect of the meal was seen during hyperglycemia. We conclude that in IDDM and in totally pancreatectomized patients, administration of insulin with subsequent normalization of blood glucose is accompanied by a decline in plasma levels of SLI in the fasted state, whereas the apparent response to a meal is enhanced. These effects on plasma levels of SLI probably reflect to a major extent release of somatostatin from the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

To achieve good control, insulin was given twice daily together with a measured diet so that hyperglycemia and glucosuria were mild and infrequent, and HbA1 was comparable to normal. Retinal capillary aneurysms and other lesions developed during 60 mo of poor control (group PC) and were inhibited if good control was begun promptly within 2 mo (group GC). In group PGC, retinopathy was absent or equivocal at 2.5 yr of poor control and, surprisingly, was found to develop subsequently despite good glycemic control. Retinopathy in group PGC was greater at autopsy than at 2.5 yr and was greater than in group GC. The results indicate that retinopathy may be preventable but tends to resist arrest even in its incipient stages, before more than the first few aneurysms have appeared.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were compared in 12 HLA-identical siblings of insulin-dependent diabetics and nondiabetic controls. Only the maximum acute insulin response to intravenous arginine was lower in the siblings than in the matched controls (P less than .05); other measures of insulin secretion, including the acute insulin response to glucose or arginine, the second-phase insulin response to glucose, and the slope of glucose potentiation, were not significantly different. Insulin sensitivity, derived from an intravenous glucose tolerance test with a minimal-modeling technique, was lower in the siblings (P less than .01). In a large group of nondiabetic controls of various adiposity, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were inversely related. In view of the difference in insulin sensitivity between siblings and matched controls, a direct comparison of beta-cell function tests may be inappropriate, and the measures of insulin secretion were compared with those of nondiabetics when adjusted for differences in insulin sensitivity. This analysis revealed that all measures of insulin secretion were significantly lower in the siblings. We conclude that HLA-identical siblings of insulin-dependent diabetics show evidence of both insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function and that analysis of beta-cell function in relation to insulin sensitivity shows a greater frequency of beta-cell secretory abnormalities than previously appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "A covalent aggregate twice the size of insulin accounts for approximately 28% of total circulating insulin immunoreactivity in type I diabetic patients. These aggregates are probably covalent dimers of insulin and should contain unique epitopes distinct from the parent molecule. Therapeutic insulin contains a similar material and is the source of the circulating aggregate. Anti-aggregate antibodies were detected by binding-inhibition techniques in 9 of 29 long-term diabetic patients. These antibodies were directed against structures distinct from those of the parent molecule insulin monomer. All antibody-positive patients were men whose blood also contained antibodies to insulin monomer. We conclude that the blood of approximately 30% of insulin-using diabetic patients contains antibodies directed against epitopes unique to the insulin aggregates. Because insulin monomer and aggregates probably share a common primary amino acid sequence, the anti-aggregate antibodies are probably directed against conformational determinants. Further work is needed to determine whether such aggregates promote or accentuate the development of anti-insulin antibodies in certain genetically predisposed individuals.\r"

Despite this, portal plasma SLI levels are elevated in diabetic animals and normalized by insulin therapy. These findings comprise indirect evidence for SLI hypersecretion by the gut in untreated BB rats. This study was undertaken with isolated stomach perfusions to investigate directly the secretory status of gastric delta-cells in this diabetic model. Isolated stomachs of three groups of insulin-treated diabetic, untreated diabetic, and nondiabetic control rats were perfused in situ under basal and glucagon-stimulated (5 nM) conditions. Untreated diabetic BB rats exhibited significant enhancement of basal and glucagon-stimulated gastric SLI release. Insulin treatment reduced gastric SLI release to significantly subnormal levels. More than 95% of basal and stimulated SLI released in diabetic BB and normal control rats coeluted with synthetic somatostatin-14 on Sephadex G-50 columns. We conclude that basal and stimulated gastric SLI release is increased in untreated BB rats and is suppressed with insulin therapy, gastric delta-cell hyperfunction accounts for portal vein hypersomatostatinemia characteristic of untreated diabetic BB rats, and somatostatin-14 is the main molecular form of SLI released from normal and diabetic stomachs.\r"

[35S]methionine and [3H]fucose were injected into the dorsal root ganglion (L5) to label protein and glycoprotein, respectively. During the 4 h of transport, thigh temperature was maintained constant. Acute severe hypoglycemia (1.5 +/- 0.2 mM) was associated with a 36% decrease in the amount of aFC (2.3 +/- 0.7% in the test group vs. 3.6 +/- 0.8% in the controls), whereas transport velocity was unaffected. Prolonged hypoglycemia, obtained by pretreatment with insulin for 3 days, prevented the decrease in amount of aFC. In STZ-D rats, acute severe hypoglycemia (1.5 +/- 0.6 mM) produced a similar but less-pronounced decrease of aFC. We conclude that hypoglycemia is associated with alterations in axonal transport that could play a role in development of neuropathy. Prolonged hypoglycemia protects axonal transport against the effects of glucopenia, and an untreated diabetic state maintained for several days has a partially protective effect against episodes of hypoglycemia.\r"

Anti-virus antibodies (e.g., Coxsackie B1-6, mumps, cytomegalovirus), islet cell antibodies (ICAs), and HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DR were determined in 74 IDDM patients (38 males, 36 females) and in controls. Total IDDM incidence was 5.0/100,000, and the incidence for those less than 20 yr of age was 11.6/100,000. Anti-virus antibody frequency was not different in IDDM patients and controls. ICAs were present in 58% of IDDM patients at onset and in 30% after 12 mo, and complement-fixing ICAs were found in 39 and 17%, respectively. IDDM was significantly and positively associated with DR3/DR4 and negatively associated with DR2 and DR5. ICA frequency was significantly higher in DR3/DR4 heterozygote patients than in patients without DR3 and DR4. These results suggest that in this IDDM population viral etiology is not evident, ICAs offer only a partial pathogenetic explanation, and genetic and immunologic heterogeneity is evident.\r"

  ".U": "87219540\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown in a glucose-responsive insulin-secreting beta-cell line (HIT cells) that a cell membrane-depolarizing concentration of K+ causes an influx of extracellular Ca2+ that elevates the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and activates insulin secretion. To identify the cellular mechanisms that couple Ca2+ influx to exocytosis, studies of protein phosphorylation were conducted. HIT cells were loaded with 32P and stimulated with either 40 mM K+ or 19.4 mM glucose, both of which trigger the immediate release of insulin. Phosphoproteins were examined with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. With addition of 40 mM K+, after the rise in [Ca2+]i, proteins of Mr 17,500, 20,000, and 24,000 were rapidly and specifically phosphorylated. The 17,000-Mr protein showed maximum phosphorylation by 1 min, whereas phosphorylation of the 24,000- and 20,000-Mr proteins continued to increase at 5 min. Despite stimulating the immediate release of insulin, high glucose did not result in a change in [Ca2+]i or the phosphorylation of the three Ca2+-dependent phosphoproteins. Insulin secretion, the increase in [Ca2+]i, and phosphorylation of the proteins by 40 mM K+ was inhibited by 100 microM verapamil, an organic Ca2+-channel-blocking drug. The rapid phosphorylation of three proteins, after a rise in [Ca2+]i and the coordinate inhibition of insulin secretion and phosphorylation, are consistent with the hypothesis that Ca2+ enters the beta-cell through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, regulating insulin release by effects on protein phosphorylation. However, glucose activates the immediate release of insulin by another, as yet undefined, mechanism.\r"

We report a method for the purification of Ia-positive islet cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The isolated mononuclear cells appear of nonendocrine origin but contain vacuoles with partially digested secretory vesicles. Both insulin- and glucagon-immunoreactive granules were identified in these vacuoles of varying size and composition. It is suggested that at least part of the rat islet cells with class II antigen expression can exhibit phagocytotic properties leading to the uptake of fragments from damaged endocrine cells. This functional characteristic may implicate this particular islet cell type in the pathology of the endocrine pancreas in type I diabetes.\r"

Renal dysfunction was defined arbitrarily as an increase in creatinine or blood urea nitrogen, or both, to 1.5 and 50 mg/dl, respectively, in patients previously having normal renal function or a 50% increase in either creatinine or blood urea nitrogen in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. Twenty-six of the 102 patients had renal dysfunction before orthotopic liver transplantation. Sixty-eight of the 102 patients studied experienced an episode of renal impairment after orthotopic liver transplantation. Forty-nine of these episodes developed early, having occurred within the first 6 days. Late renal impairment occurred in 36 cases at 32 +/- 6 days after orthotopic liver transplantation. Using multivariate analysis, cirrhosis of a noncholestatic nature was found to be an independent predictor of early renal impairment. Trough blood cyclosporin A levels measured by radioimmunoassay were higher in those who experienced early renal impairment or late renal impairment than in those who did not (p less than 0.05). Several factors capable of adversely influencing renal function (nephrotoxic drugs, shock, and graft failure) other than cyclosporin A were present also in half of the patients who developed late renal impairment. Overall, 25 patients died. Multivariate analyses identified serious postoperative infection, graft failure, and preoperative renal dysfunction to be independent predictors of mortality.\r"

The properties of SMP, and in particular its relationship to another aspartic proteinase, cathepsin D, were examined in this study. Slow moving proteinase and cathepsin D were isolated, respectively, from gastric mucosa and human spleen. Antiserum specific to each proteinase was prepared in rabbits. Rabbit anti-SMP did not recognize cathepsin D, and conversely, anticathepsin D did not react with SMP. Immunohistochemical studies localized SMP to surface epithelial cells in both the fundic and pyloric gland areas of the stomach. In contrast, cathepsin D was found mainly in mononuclear cells in the lamina propria and in parietal cells. Slow moving proteinase exhibited considerably lower Km values for its interaction with two chromogenic substrates than did cathepsin D. An even greater distinction between the two enzymes was found with the protein inhibitor from Ascaris lumbricoides; the activity of SMP was inhibited very strongly, whereas that of cathepsin D was not affected. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, SMP consisted of two subunits with apparent molecular weights of 42,500 and 41,000. The last two properties characterize a less-well-known aspartic proteinase, cathepsin E. We conclude that SMP is not cathepsin D, but that it may be cathepsin E.\r"

Three preparations of a water soluble fraction (Frazer's fraction III, FIII) of partial peptic tryptic digests of wheat gluten had different effects in a direct (one stage) assay. Subfractions B and B2 caused migration inhibition of leucocytes from patients with treated coeliac disease but not of leucocytes from healthy volunteers or patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. This migration inhibition seems to be specific for gluten fractions because maize zein fraction B, beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin did not cause it. The sensitivity of coeliac leucocytes to fraction B is not related to factors present in coeliac serum as the migration of leucocytes from healthy individuals preincubated with coeliac sera was not inhibited. Puromycin diminished inhibition by fraction B, which was active at 1.2 micrograms/ml in an indirect (two stage) migration inhibition assay; this is consistent with a process involving elaboration of lymphokine(s). More highly purified fractions of B2, P1-P4 were prepared by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and showed differing potency in direct and indirect assays, with P4 being the most active fraction. Inhibition of migration by gluten derived peptides appears to result from the release of lymphokine by leucocytes specifically from coeliac patients.\r"

On increasing the pentagastrin infusion rate the inhibition was surmounted suggesting it was competitive in type. Nifedipine did not affect basal or Oxo meal stimulated gastrin concentrations in normal volunteers nor did it affect resting serum gastrin or calcium stimulated increase in gastrin in a single patient with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. These findings are consistent with the transmembrane flux of calcium ions being involved in basal and pentagastrin stimulated acid secretion in man.\r"

Fifty patients completed the trial. The patients were interviewed every third month. If symptoms indicated a relapse, endoscopy was done; and if an ulcer was found the maintenance trial was terminated. All remaining patients were endoscoped after one year. The accumulated relapse rate in the ranitidine group (36%) was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than in the placebo group (76%), as also was the antacid consumption (p less than 0.01). Four of the six ulcers found at the final one year endoscopy were asymptomatic. In all but two of the 26 patients with relapse of symptoms an ulcer was found at endoscopy. The patients that suffered a recurrence had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher maximal acid output than those without ulcer recurrence. The time needed for healing of the relapse ulcers (four or eight weeks) corresponded to that needed for healing of the preinclusion ulcers. It is concluded that ranitidine 150 mg at night significantly reduces the gastric ulcer recurrence rate, and that relapsing ulcers are similar to the initial ones in healing response.\r"

Cytomegalovirus infection was shown histologically, but the virus could not be cultured from the stool; no other gastrointestinal pathogens could be demonstrated. The patients were treated with a 14 day continuous infusion of Foscarnet 0.08 mg/kg/min (phosphonoformate, Astra Pharmaceuticals). One patient showed a partial response to therapy, but the cytomegalovirus colitis relapsed; the second patient had a symptomatic response only and the third patient died of non-cytomegalovirus opportunist infection while on treatment. Two other patients with biopsy proven cytomegalovirus ulceration of the oesophagus were seen, presenting with dysphagia, fever and weight loss. Invasive infection of the gastrointestinal tract with cytomegalovirus is now a major clinical problem in AIDS.

The evidence raised includes biochemical, physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral studies conducted in in vitro and in vivo systems, experimental models of hypertension, and humans with essential hypertension. While the compelling biochemical and pharmacological evidence in experimental animals clearly shows the presence of opioid peptides and their receptors in strategic sites of cardiovascular control and potent cardiovascular response to opioid peptides, opioid antagonists show no consistent blockade or reversal of hypertension in experimental animals or humans. One possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the vast redundancy in systems regulating blood pressure (i.e., the blockade of one system still leaves many other systems fully able to rapidly offset the eliminated system). Regarding the opioid system, the situation is much more complex, since some opioid receptors (mu-type) mediate pressor responses, while other receptors (kappa-type) mediate depressor responses. Therefore, nonselective opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naloxone), which block both types of receptors, can be devoid of any cardiovascular activity, while a selective mu-receptor antagonist or a selective and potent kappa-receptor agonist may produce the desired antihypertensive effect. A combination of both actions (i.e., a drug that is both a mu-antagonist and a kappa-agonist) might be even more advantageous. Until such compounds are developed, this hypothesis will be hard to prove.\r"

  ".W": "The suggestion has been made that the Okamoto strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) shares some features with a subgroup of patients with essential hypertension, called nonmodulators. One feature of nonmodulators is a renal blood flow response to angiotensin II (ANG II) that is blunted on a high salt diet; the blunted renal vascular response is corrected by converting enzyme inhibition. Renal blood flow (electromagnetic flowmeter) and pressor responses to graded ANG II doses (5-300 ng) were assessed in 24 SHR and 24 Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) ingesting 1.6% Na. In comparison to WKY, blood pressure was higher in SHR (155 +/- 4 vs 106 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), renal blood flow was lower (6.9 +/- 0.5 vs 8.2 +/- 0.4 ml/min/g; p less than 0.05), and the pressor response to ANG II was enhanced, (p less than 0.0005) but the renal vascular response was blunted (p less than 0.005). Captopril (1-30 mg/kg) reduced blood pressure more in SHR than in WKY but increased renal blood flow similarly in both strains. The blunted renal vascular response to ANG II in SHR was reversed by captopril, but inhibition of converting enzyme in the kidney did not parallel systemic inhibition. Maximum blockade of converting enzyme in the kidney appears to require a larger captopril dose than is required for systemic inhibition. These results suggest that the renal blood supply in SHR also shares some of the characteristics of nonmodulators and that the action of captopril on the renal blood flow probably reflects reversal of inappropriate intrarenal ANG II formation.\r"

  ".U": "87220843\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that administration of the serotonin releaser p-chloroamphetamine HCl produces a dose-dependent increase in renin secretion through a blood-borne renin-releasing factor. The present studies were designed to partially characterize this renin-releasing factor using an in vitro kidney slice method for the bioassay of renin-releasing activity. Plasma from p-chloroamphetamine-treated, nephrectomized rats was used to obtain the renin-releasing factor, which was fractionated by ultrafiltration into fractions of molecular weight ranges of 1000 to 5000, 5000 to 10,000, and 10,000 to 20,000. The molecular weight ranges of the renin-releasing factor was determined to be between 5000 and 10,000. Since previous studies have shown that lesions in the hypothalamus prevent the effect of p-chloroamphetamine on renin secretion, we tested whether a hypothalamic extract can release renin from kidney slices. Addition of extracts of boiled rat hypothalamic tissue to the kidney slices caused an increase in renin release. Addition of cerebellar extracts produced a smaller increase in renin release, whereas addition of pituitary extracts had no effect. Fractionation by ultrafiltration of bovine hypothalamic extract revealed that the fraction with a molecular weight range of 5000 to 10,000 possessed the highest renin-releasing ability. The 1000 to 5000 (molecular weight) fraction possessed a sizeable renin-releasing activity, but the 10,000 to 20,000 fraction had no renin-releasing activity. Both bovine hypothalamus fractions (molecular weights between 1000-5000 and 5000-10,000) and plasma fraction lost their renin-releasing activity after digestion with pronase, suggesting that the renin-releasing factor or factors are peptides. These results suggest that a renin-releasing factor originate in the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "Renal cortical slices obtained from male New Zealand rabbits were used to investigate the role of adenosine in the regulation of renin release. Isoproterenol produced a significant (p less than 0.01), twofold to threefold increase in renin release, that was both dose-dependent and time-dependent. Addition of either the l-phenylisopropyl or the N6-ethylcarboxamido derivative of adenosine attenuated this stimulation at concentrations as low as 10(-9) M or 10(-8) M, respectively. Higher doses of d-phenylisopropyladenosine (10(-6) M) or adenosine (10(-5) M) were necessary to significantly reduce the beta-adrenergic response (p less than 0.01). Inhibition was absent in slices preincubated with 10(-5) M 8-phenyltheophylline, a concentration that had no effect on either basal or stimulated renin release. The site of inhibition appeared to be distal to beta-adrenergic and prostaglandin receptors since l-phenylisopropyladenosine (10(-8) M) blocked stimulation by selective beta-adrenergic receptor agonists, prenalterol (10(-6) M) or salbutamol (10(-5) M), and by prostaglandin E1. These data suggest that adenosine and its analogues inhibit renin release and that this inhibition may be mediated by a receptor-dependent action on a common point in the pathway leading to release.\r"

After 4 weeks of captopril therapy alone, mean arterial pressure fell by 12 mm Hg, and with the addition of nifedipine to captopril for a further month, blood pressure fell by an additional 10 mm Hg. In a separate group of patients treated with the same doses, mean arterial pressure fell by 17 mm Hg with nifedipine treatment alone; when captopril was added to the nifedipine therapy for an additional month, mean arterial pressure fell by a further 11 mm Hg. These blood pressures were measured 2 hours after the last dose; however, there was less of a fall in blood pressure when it was measured 12 hours after the last dose. This study confirms that captopril and nifedipine have a marked additive effect on blood pressure in whichever order they are given, but it shows that the combination is relatively short-acting.\r"

The incidence of major complications was higher after operation (17%) than in those treated conservatively (4%). Patients who were treated more than one week after injury, however, had an inferior result with respect to power of plantarflexion after conservative management. It is therefore recommended that calcaneal tendon rupture is treated conservatively with a plaster in full equinus when it is diagnosed within 48 hours of injury, and by operation when diagnosis has been delayed for more than one week.\r"

The present work evaluates the results of axillo-axillary bypass in 33 patients who underwent this procedure in the past 13 years. There were 13 males and 20 females with a mean age of 61 years. The occlusive disease was present in the subclavian artery in 19 patients and in the right subclavian artery in 14 patients. Eleven patients presented with central nervous system symptoms and 10 patients complained of ischemic arm symptoms. The remaining 12 patients had both central neurological and upper extremity complaints. Twenty-one of these patients were followed for up to 5 years (mean follow-up 21 months). One patient died during the procedure from myocardial infarction (mortality of 3.03%). Patency of the bypass was determined by palpation of the graft pulse, doppler examination, and brachial arterial pressure determination. The patency rate, after 5 years, calculated by life table analysis, was 72%. In conclusion, axillo-axillary artery bypass can provide durable relief of symptoms with an acceptably high patency rate and low morbidity and mortality. It is the technique of choice in high-risk patients.\r"

The leading disturbances are obviously caused by air in the graft material and are not caused by the material itself. By squeezing the graft carefully between the thumb and forefinger, blood slowly penetrates the wall colouring it red. The squeezing is performed intermittently to avoid occlusion of the graft. Excellent flow registration is obtained after less than 2 min squeezing of the thin walled graft, while at least 5 min squeezing is necessary to obtain signals from thick walled grafts.

The signals were analysed to derive peak velocity (Vp), systolic velocity integral [an index of stroke volume or stroke distance (Sd)], and minute distance (Md; index of cardiac output = Sd X heart rate). Comparison was made with results obtained from 66 normal volunteers. The percentage change in stroke distance with exercise (% delta Sd) was significantly related to the resting ejection fraction (EF) calculated from left ventriculography (r = 0.84), and was below 6% (lowest value observed in normal volunteers) in all of the 23 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) whose EF was below 60%. No significant difference was observed in the % delta Sd between normal individuals and the 12 patients presenting with chest pain but who had normal coronary arteriograms. However, the % delta Vp, delta % Sd and % delta Md in the 50 patients with CAD were significantly lower than the normal individuals and the 12 patients with normal coronary arteriograms. Lower TAV measurements were observed with exercise, rather than at rest, with increasing number of coronary arteries with significant stenoses and the presence of history of myocardial infarction (linear trend p less than 0.003). These results suggest that Doppler recording of aortic blood velocity with exercise is a clinically useful non-invasive technique for studying LV performance in patients with CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prorenin, the enzymatically inactive biosynthetic precursor of renin, is secreted by the kidneys. However, the ovaries appear to be the source of the cyclical increase in plasma prorenin that occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle. In this study we examined the temporal relationship between changes in plasma prorenin and LH in normal women to determine whether ovarian prorenin secretion might be stimulated by LH. Blood was collected from nine normal women daily for 7 days in the midcycle period and from six of them every 8 h on 6 of these days. Time zero was taken as the highest plasma LH value. The initial rise in LH (-24 h) preceded the initial rise in prorenin (-8 h) and the LH peak preceded the prorenin peak by 8-16 h. These sequential increases in plasma LH and prorenin occurred in the presence of high plasma estradiol levels. While LH fell in parallel with estradiol, the prorenin peak was more sustained and plasma prorenin remained above baseline at 40 and 48 h, at a time when both estradiol and LH had reached a new basal level. These results suggest that gonadotropins stimulate ovarian prorenin release. The timing of the changes in plasma prorenin and its presence in high concentrations in ovarian follicular fluid suggest that prorenin may be involved in the process of ovulation. The results also suggest that changes in plasma prorenin may determine the activity of an ovarian renin system that functions independently of circulating active renin.\r"

The cells, isolated as single cells or small cell clusters, reaggregated to almost the size of islets by the fifth culture day and were maintained in vitro for more than 1 month. Morphologically (light and electron microscopies) they were intact throughout the culture period. Immunohistochemically more than 50% of the cells in each reaggregate contained insulin. Incubation experiments revealed that a low glucose concentration (15 mg/dL) was sufficient to produce maximal insulin release. In the absence of glucose, 1 microgram/mL glibenclamide increased insulin release. On the other hand, 5 mM theophylline and 10 mM arginine did not alter insulin release significantly. Theophylline, arginine, and glibenclamide did not have any stimulatory effect on insulin release in the presence of 50 mg/dL glucose. Perifusion experiments with 50 mg/dL glucose disclosed a biphasic pattern of insulin release, and no significant change in insulin release occurred when the glucose concentration in the perifusate was switched from 50 to 150 and then back to 50 mg/dL. These findings demonstrate that human insulinoma cells can be isolated and maintained in vitro and that the cells have abnormal sensitivity to glucose.\r"

When given hypertonic saline, the men had less hypoglycemia in response to insulin, both acutely and in the recovery phase (P less than 0.01), and released 34% more glucagon (P less than 0.05) than when they were water loaded. The total integrated ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and GH responses to hypoglycemia were similar after saline and water loading. After the saline load, the mean plasma vasopressin level rose from 11.0 +/- 2.2 (+/- SEM) to 20.9 +/- 2.9 pg/mL in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In contrast, after the water load, vasopressin levels were undetectable (less than 2 pg/mL) and they increased only to 2.6 +/- 0.4 pg/mL with hypoglycemia. There was a significant positive correlation between basal plasma vasopressin and nadir glucose concentrations and a significant negative correlation between basal plasma vasopressin and the integrated fall in glucose after insulin administration (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.025, respectively). The difference in the glycemic response to insulin may be related to the high vasopressin levels after saline loading, which could, either directly and/or through enhanced glucagon release, increase hepatic glucose production and thus limit the hypoglycemic response to insulin.\r"

We conducted this study to assess the effect of suramin on adrenal function and structure in a primate, the cynomolgus monkey. Five male monkeys were treated with suramin (800 mg/m2, im) once a week, for 5 weeks. Five other animals (controls) received saline. The treated animals had progressive elevations of plasma ACTH (P less than 0.05) and PRA (P less than 0.02) and decreased serum cortisol responses 30 min after the administration of synthetic ACTH (P less than 0.05) compared to controls. There was disruption of the architecture of the adrenal cortex, a diffuse inflammatory cell infiltrate, and thinning of the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata in the suramin-treated animals. We conclude that suramin is toxic to adrenal cortical tissue and might be useful in treating conditions with adrenal cortical hyperfunction, such as adrenal cortical carcinoma and Cushing's syndrome.\r"

Fasting serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, and bone Gla-protein (osteocalcin) levels, as well as urinary calcium, cAMP, and hydroxyproline excretion and the renal tubular threshold for phosphate were determined before and after 6 months of GnRH superagonist contraceptive treatment in 47 women, 22 of whom smoked more than 10 cigarettes daily. Before treatment the women who smoked had significantly higher serum phosphate concentrations and lower serum PTH concentrations than the women who did not smoke. Fasting serum calcium and the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio increased after treatment in all women, especially in the nonsmokers. The nonsmokers also had more pronounced increases in serum phosphate and osteocalcin concentrations. A decrease in serum PTH during treatment was confined to the nonsmokers. These results suggest increased bone resorption and turnover during GnRH agonist-induced anovulation and indicate that smoking habits should be taken into account in the evaluation of bone disease.\r"

In the chronically treated Graves' disease patients, the percentage of activated T cells (HLA-DR+ T cells) among total T cells was significantly higher in thyroid tissue than in peripheral blood, and the increase in percent activated T cells was also significant among both helper/inducer T cell (CD4+ cell) and suppressor/cytotoxic T cell (CD8+ cell) subsets. The percentage of activated T cells in peripheral blood was not significantly different between chronically treated hyperthyroid Graves' patients and normal subjects, whereas the percentage of activated T cells in the peripheral blood from untreated hyperthyroid Graves' disease patients was significantly higher than that in normal subjects or chronically treated hyperthyroid Graves' patients. The percentages of CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells among total T cells were not different between thyroid tissues and peripheral blood in patients with chronically treated hyperthyroid Graves' disease. When CD4+ were further divided into helper T cells (CD4+2H4- cells) and suppressor-inducer T cells (CD4+2H4+ cells) using two-color flow cytometry, the percentage of helper T cells among CD4+ cells was significantly higher in thyroid tissue than in peripheral blood, resulting in an increased ratio of CD4+2H4- cells to CD4+2H4+ cells. The percentage of CD4+2H4+ cells in peripheral blood, however, was not significantly different among untreated and chronically treated Graves' disease patients and normal subjects. From the findings of abnormalities in intrathyroidal T cell subsets, we suggest that the decrease in the function of suppressor T cells within the thyroids of Graves' disease patients may be due to a decrease in CD4+2H4+ cells within thyroid tissue.\r"

Immunoreactive CRH was detectable in the plasma of all normal subjects (mean +/- SD, 6.2 +/- 2.4 pg/mL; n = 15). Basal (0800-1000 h) plasma immunoreactive CRH levels were significantly lower in patients with Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal (2.8 +/- 1.1 pg/mL; n = 4) or pituitary adenomas (2.9 +/- 0.8 pg/mL; n = 5), in patients with hypothalamic hypopituitarism (3.2 +/- 0.9 pg/mL; n = 5), and in glucocorticoid-treated patients (3.9 +/- 1.9 pg/mL, n = 8). Basal plasma CRH levels were also low in patients with acromegaly (2.8 +/- 0.8 pg/mL; n = 14) and insulin-treated diabetic patients whose pituitary-adrenal function was normal (3.6 +/- 1.0 pg/mL; n = 12). In normal subjects plasma CRH levels increased after insulin-induced hypoglycemia; this response was abolished by the prior administration of dexamethasone. In contrast, basal plasma CRH levels were not affected by prior administration of metyrapone or dexamethasone. No evidence for diurnal variation in plasma immunoreactive CRH was found in normal subjects. In addition, in normal subjects oral glucose administration elicited a significant increase in plasma CRH (basal, 7.3 +/- 0.9 pg/mL; peak 30 min after glucose, 16.7 +/- 5.8 pg/mL; n = 5; P less than 0.05) without concomitant changes in ACTH. Gel filtration of extracts of pooled plasma from normal subjects revealed a major component of immunoreactive CRH in the position of synthetic rat CRH. Immunoreactive CRH-sized material had the same retention time as authentic rat CRH in a reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography system. The content of immunoreactive CRH in human placenta, pancreas, and adrenal gland was much larger than that in hypothalamus. These findings suggest that immunoreactive CRH is present in peripheral plasma; the increase in plasma immunoreactive CRH after insulin-induced hypoglycemia may reflect stimulation of hypothalamic CRH release; the increase in plasma immunoreactive CRH after glucose administration may reflect extrahypothalamic CRH release; and the lack of diurnal variation in plasma immunoreactive CRH together with the lack of suppression of CRH by dexamethasone suggest that basal plasma CRH is of extrahypothalamic origin.\r"

Parenteral delivery of levonorgestrel and 17 beta-estradiol by intravaginal ring (CVR) was compared with oral administration (OC) of norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol in the diet. LH secretion was suppressed in the CVR group compared to that in other groups, and the response in males was greater than that in either CYC or OC females (P less than 0.01). Elevated plasma PRL concentrations in the CVR group during the baseline period (P less than 0.05) together with their larger pituitary weights (P less than 0.01) suggested lactotroph hypertrophy or hyperplasia compared to other groups. The plasma GH response was similar in the male, CYC, and CVR groups, but plasma GH levels increased from -15 to 0 min before HRP injection in the OC group (P less than 0.001) and continued to be higher for 15 min after HRP compared to values in the other groups (P less than 0.001), suggesting a treatment effect. Neither plasma TSH nor T4 levels were different among the groups after HRP administration, but T4 was elevated (P less than 0.01) in the OC group due to increased T4-binding globulin. The greater ACTH response 15 min after HRP treatment (P less than 0.05) in the CVR group compared to that in the other groups was associated with greater adrenal weights of the CVR females (P less than 0.05), suggesting chronic tropic stimulation. However the adrenal steroid results did not support this interpretation. We conclude that the differences in pituitary hormone secretion during these studies could be attributed to the nature of the reproductive steroid environment.\r"

Obese men (n = 9) had higher AIRs to isoproterenol than lean men (n = 11) at basal glucose levels [52 +/- 9 (SEM) vs. 32 +/- 5 microU/mL; P less than 0.05], and the difference increased as the ambient glucose level was raised (at 230 mg/dL; 263 +/- 22 vs. 140 +/- 21 microU/mL; P less than 0.0008). The individuals' slopes of glucose potentiation of AIR to isoproterenol were positively correlated with their excess weight (r = 0.72; P less than 0.001). Similar results were found when arginine was used as the secretagogue in other men and in women; the slope of potentiation was positively correlated with excess weight in both men and women (both P less than 0.005), although the effect of excess weight on slope was 51% greater among men (P less than 0.03). An independent measurement of insulin sensitivity (the Bergman SI) was made in the women. The potentiation slope was inversely correlated with SI (P less than 0.0001), indicating that the effect of obesity on insulin secretion is correlated with insulin resistance. These results characterize one mechanism contributing to the hyperinsulinemia of obesity and highlight the importance of considering the prevailing insulin sensitivity when assessing islet function.\r"

The time course of enzyme conversion at 4 degrees C was greatly extended with half-conversion times of 6, 5, 5, and 6 d for the respective tissues. Increases in xanthine oxidase activity were accompanied by the appearance of a distinct new protein species with greater electrophoretic mobility. The oxidase from ischemic rat liver was purified 781-fold and found to migrate with a higher mobility on native gels than the purified native dehydrogenase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate profiles revealed the presence of a single major band of 137 kD for the native dehydrogenase, whereas the oxidase had been partially cleaved generating polypeptides of 127, 91, and 57 kD. Polypeptide patterns for the oxidase resemble those seen following limited in vitro proteolysis of the native dehydrogenase supporting a proteolytic mechanism for the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to oxidase in ischemic rat liver.\r"

Mean plasma somatostatin levels (SLI) increased from 11 +/- 2 pmol liter-1 to peak concentrations of 18 +/- 2 in six healthy male volunteers after a steak meal (P less than 0.05). Infusion of somatostatin inhibited hormone-induced exocrine pancreatic secretion and suppressed cerulein-stimulated pancreatic polypeptide (PP) secretion, but did not significantly change arginine-stimulated insulin and glucagon release at mean plasma somatostatin concentrations within the range seen after a meal. The amount of somatostatin released after a meal thus was of sufficient magnitude to inhibit exocrine pancreatic function and PP release. On the other hand, basal and arginine-stimulated glucagon and insulin secretions were not significantly affected by these plasma concentrations of intravenous somatostatin suggesting that the exocrine pancreas might be more sensitive to somatostatin than the islet cells. We conclude that somatostatin in concentrations within the range seen after a meal is a potent inhibitor of stimulated acinar cell function in man. The findings support the hypothesis that somatostatin acts as a true hormonal regulator.\r"

The immunoprecipitated molecules were identified as the LFA-1 alpha and beta chains by their comigration on SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and by sequential clearance experiments. Serum E27 did not immunoprecipitate LFA-1 from autologous cells, though LFA-1 molecules were present. In contrast, serum E27 immunoprecipitated LFA-1 from most but not all normal donor lymphocytes. Thus, serum E27 defines two serological phenotypes of LFA-1. 95% of normal individuals tested exhibited the LFA-1 phenotype precipitated by serum E27. Serum E27 appears to be directed at determinants of the LFA-1 alpha-chain and not the beta-chain since it immunoprecipitated LFA-1 molecules but not the Mac-1 molecules. Additional evidence for the alpha chain specificity was provided by immunoprecipitation of mouse-human heterohybridoma cells. LFA-1 was immunoprecipitated by serum E27 from mouse-human heterohybridoma cells expressing the human alpha-chain, not from a hybrid cell line expressing the human beta-chain. Together these findings demonstrate an antigenic polymorphism of the human LFA-1 alpha-chain molecule.\r"

Relapsed patients whose cell lines had c-myc DNA amplification survived a shorter period (median of 33 wk) than patients whose cell lines did not have c-myc amplification (median of 53 wk; P = 0.04). We conclude that myc family DNA amplification is more common in tumor cell lines established from treated than untreated patients' tumors, and c-myc amplification in treated patients' tumor cell lines is associated with shortened survival.\r"

At the lowest insulin level, the Michaelis constants (Ks:s) for glucose disposal in whole body (8.7 +/- 1.1 mM) and across forearm (7.4 +/- 1.4) mM) were compatible with a Ks determined in vitro for the transport system. At higher insulin levels, the apparent Ks increased significantly in whole body (16.2-37.7 mM) and across forearm (20.7-31.2 mM). We interpret the apparent increase of Ks by insulin to reflect a shift in the rate-limiting step from glucose transport to some step beyond transport.\r"

In contrast to its growth-promoting effects on normal myeloid progenitor cells, we found that GM-CSF unexpectedly inhibited the colony growth of U937 cells in agar culture. Furthermore, medium conditioned by recombinant GM-CSF(rGM-CSF)-treated U937 cells was found to exert an inhibitory effect on subsequent U937 colony growth that was partially due to the presence of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). By Northern blot analysis, rGM-CSF was shown to induce expression of the TNF gene in U937 cells and in T-lymphocyte-depleted, monocyte-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, rGM-CSF was observed to significantly enhance TNF secretion by monocytes stimulated with endotoxin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). These data suggest that some of the biological effects of GM-CSF may be amplified through the release of monokines such as TNF.\r"

When co-administered with a specific antigen, rIL-2 can enhance concentrations of murine IgM antibodies specific for the antigen by fivefold within 7 d of initial treatment. IgM antibodies that are induced after injection of rIL-2 include antibodies specific for J5, a cell wall core lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen that is shared by the different members of the Enterobactericeae family. We report here that mice pretreated with rIL-2 or immunized with J5 antigen 7 d before bacterial challenge were protected from septic death that is caused by intraperitoneal challenges with Escherichia coli. Optimal protection was provided by a combined J5 antigen and rIL-2 treatment. Acquisition of the rIL-2 and J5 antigen-induced protection against lethal bacterial infection coincided temporally with maximal serum IgM titers that also contained IgM antibodies specific for the J5 antigen. In passive immunization experiments, the affinity-purified IgM fraction in sera of rIL-2-treated animals was identified as necessary and sufficient for protection. The IgM-depleted serum had no protective effect. The nonspecific augmentation of host-defense mechanisms without the induction of endotoxin manifestations makes rIL-2 a potential candidate to any alternative LPS-containing vaccines for the prevention of bacterial infections by gram-negative organisms since the core LPS antigen is shared among gram-negative bacteria.\r"

By immunofluorescence ACE was not detectable in normal glomeruli. However, when kidneys were perfused with GtARbACE antibodies glomerular bound IgG was seven times higher than that of non-immune IgG and granular deposits of goat IgG were found on the endothelium of glomeruli and arteries. Rabbits injected intravenous for 4 d with GtARbACE antibodies showed on day 1 granular deposits of goat IgG on the glomerular endothelium; from day 3 to 24 there was gradual development of subepithelial deposits of goat IgG, rabbit IgG and C3. When GtARbACE antibodies were similarly injected into proteinuric rabbits there was formation of subepithelial granular deposits of goat IgG and ACE. The results document that a glomerular endothelial antigen is redistributed in vivo by a specific ligand, an event associated with formation of immune deposits. Furthermore, if the glomerular permeability is artificially increased, immune complexes shed from nonglomerular endothelia into the circulation can contribute to form subepithelial immune deposits.\r"

Responses of guinea pig tracheal rings to substance P were also markedly potentiated by phosphoramidon. The increase in tissue responsiveness by these inhibitors was relatively specific for substance P among several other spasmogenic peptides, including formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and the complement peptides C3a and C5a. The enhanced responses appear to result from a decrease in the rate of substance P degradation in the presence of neutral endopeptidase inhibitors. Specific binding of substance P to its receptor on bronchial membranes was increased by three- to fourfold in the presence of phosphoramidon. These data demonstrate an enhanced potential for substance P to contract lung tissues when degradation by a neutral endopeptidase-like enzyme is blocked.\r"

In this communication, we have developed a specific radiometric assay (which utilizes 3H-Factor IX and is sensitive to less than 1% of plasma level) for this inhibitor and have measured its activity in various disease states. Strikingly, the levels of this inhibitor were found to be normal in patients with advanced chronic hepatocellular disease but low in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). When endotoxin was used to induce DIC in rabbits, the levels of this inhibitor fell by 25-90%. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE), bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, and a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) all synthesized and secreted this inhibitor, whereas a promyelocytic cell line (HL-60) did not and a monocytic cell line (U937) appears to synthesize only small amounts. When ammonium sulfate-fractionated human plasma and serum-free conditioned media from both HUVE and HepG2 cells were electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gels, two activity peaks corresponding to Mr approximately 45,000 and Mr approximately 33,000 were eluted in each case. These observations suggest that (a) the inhibitor is consumed in DIC and that (b) endothelial cells (or other cells) synthesize sufficient amounts of this inhibitor in vivo to compensate for any decreased production by liver cells.\r"

The five monoclonal antibodies gave similar positive results with both techniques only in samples of ALL. J5 was positive in variable degrees by immunofluorescence in the majority of B cell disorders examined but this was not confirmed by immunoperoxidase. OKB-cALLA reacted in a similar way to J5 in both techniques, although with a lower percentage of cells by immunofluorescence. Nu-N1, Nu-N2, and VIL-A1 were mainly negative when tested by both immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase in B cell disorders other than ALL and therefore seemed to be more specific for the diagnosis of common-ALL.\r"

Correlation was assessed between the measured volume of the operatively removed spleens, their volumes as calculated from the ultrasound data, and their preoperative dimensions of length, circumference, and area on the scans. The relation of scan to volume was best defined by an equation V = 9.88A - 534, where V = volume of spleen (cm3) and A = area (cm2) on posterior scan. The mean percentage difference between calculated and actual spleen volume was 0.2 (SD 6.7)%. Average spleen density was established as 1.04 g/cm3. The formula was shown to be reliable in the range of splenic area c 73-450 cm2--that is, volume c 185-4000 cm3. This range includes the average normal sized spleens and the splenomegalies that are most often found in clinical practice. The formula is not valid when the spleen is smaller than normal. As the method depends on measurement of the spleen image shown by scintigraphs, it cannot be used when there is functional asplenia.\r"

Formolised yolk sac antigens made from L pneumophila serogroups 1, 6, and 7 were also used. Although antibodies were produced to several L pneumophila serogroups or Legionella species by individuals, there was no constant pattern, suggesting that the response is a characteristic of the infected individual and not of the infecting strain of Legionella. There is evidence that heat-killed antigen made from L pneumophila serogroup 7 may give unreliable results.\r"

Although each new retinoid is developed with the aim of maximizing specific therapeutic effects and minimizing toxicity, the fact remains that the major side effects of retinoid treatment are those of hypervitaminosis A syndrome. Optimal clinical utilization of new retinoids is best accomplished by an assessment of what is currently known about retinol absorption, metabolism and organ-specific effects, as well as by a thorough understanding of hypervitaminosis A syndrome.

Most patients with bullous pemphigoid demonstrate circulating autoantibodies reactive with an antigen located in the lamina lucida region of the basement membrane zone. Complement activation by these autoantibodies initiates influx and activation of mast cells along with other inflammatory cells. Tissue injury with damage and eventual destruction of the basement membrane occurs as a result of the release of inflammatory mediators. The final result is subepidermal blister formation. The course of bullous pemphigoid tends to be self-limited, and successful treatment is usually effected with systemic glucocorticosteroids.\r"

Vellus, nonvellus, and total hair counts were done in two 1-inch in diameter circular target areas in symmetric regions of the scalp and on each upper arm at regular intervals. All nine subjects had an increase in target nonvellus hair and a net loss of vellus hair in scalp target area treated with topical minoxidil. Concomitant UVL did not have a significant synergistic nor adverse effect on topical minoxidil-induced hair growth.\r"

Eleven patients were identified clinically as responders to inosiplex in terms of hair regrowth. Scalp biopsy results correlated well with drug therapy. Enhanced immune function was found in the majority of responding patients; however, statistical analysis of the results of the entire patient population revealed limited significant differences.

Preoperative aids include scar elevation and punch grafting of deep scars prior to dermabrasion. Retinoic acid can prime the skin for more rapid healing. Gas sterilization of electrical equipment eliminates cross-contamination between patients. Intraoperative improvements include regional block anesthesia of the face, staged narcotic administration and newer methods of facial prechilling, and criteria for the ambient air in the operatory. Gentian Violet staining of the face and use of microfoam tape to delineate the mandibular boundary of a dermabrasion are helpful. The use of a custom handle for the spray refrigerant, the safety of Turkish towels used for retraction, and the application of a sharp Buck's curette make the procedure simpler and more effective. Postoperative aids include the use of systemic steroids and the new biological dressings which simplify the postoperative recovery period.\r"

  ".W": "Over a 5 year period at three centers, 53 patients underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of a right coronary artery ostial stenosis. The procedure was successful in 42 patients (79%) and unsuccessful in 11, of whom 5 (9.4%) required emergency coronary artery bypass grafting because of abrupt closure. The right coronary ostial lesion had distinctive technical requirements to achieve success, including high pressure balloon inflation (10 +/- 4 atm) and the need for unconventional right coronary guide catheters. Technical factors that account for increased difficulty in these patients include: problems with guide catheter impaction and ostial trauma; inability to inflate the balloon with adequate guide catheter support; and need for increased intracoronary manipulation. The stenoses were quite discrete (4 +/- 5 mm) and calcified in the majority (40) of the 53 patients. Long-term follow-up (mean 12.5 months, range 4 to 60) of these patients demonstrated clinical recurrence of angina in 20 patients (48%) and angiographically proved restenosis in 16 (38%). Repeat coronary angioplasty was successful in three of six patients for relief of symptoms for over 6 months. In conclusion, angioplasty of the right coronary ostial lesion compared with nonostial dilation leads to a suboptimal early success rate; an apparent high risk of emergency bypass surgery; and a high restenosis rate. Careful assessment of the patient with this lesion and improved technology appear to be warranted.\r"

The cyclists had a larger left ventricular internal diameter on echocardiography (55.2 versus 47.9 mm; p less than 0.001) and a disproportionate increase in wall thickness relative to the internal diameter (0.48 versus 0.41; p less than 0.01), indicating a mixed eccentric-concentric type of hypertrophy. Left ventricular inflow Doppler velocimetry showed similar results in athletes and control subjects for peak flow velocities in the atrial contraction phase (30 versus 32 cm/s; p = NS) and in the early diastolic rapid filling phase (71 versus 67 cm/s; p = NS). The similar ratio of both velocities, that is, 0.43 in the cyclists and 0.49 in the control subjects, suggests that left ventricular distensibility is unaltered in cyclists. It is concluded that the left ventricular hypertrophy observed in cyclists is not associated with changes in ventricular stiffness, as estimated from left ventricular inflow Doppler velocimetry.\r"

  ".W": "In low flow states, underestimation errors occur when the Gorlin formula is used to calculate valve area. A model of valvular stenosis designed to examine changes in the hydraulic discharge coefficient (Cd) and coefficient of orifice contraction (Cc) may explain these errors. Unsteady flow was examined in a pulsatile pump model and in a dog model. Valve areas were calculated from pressure and flow data using: a modified form of the Gorlin formula (assuming constant values for Cd and Cc) and a corrected formula (with values of Cd and Cc obtained from steady state data). Valve area was also calculated using the continuity equation with velocity and flow data (constant Cc). Flow velocities were measured using a newly designed ultrasound Doppler catheter capable of resolving flow velocities of up to 5.5 m/s. Both the corrected formula and continuity equation were highly predictive of actual valve area (r = 0.99, slope or M = 0.96 and r = 0.99, M = 1.06, respectively). The modified Gorlin equation was less accurate and tended to underestimate valve areas (r = 0.87, M = 0.83). This underestimation was most notable at low rates of flow (Gorlin: r = 0.94, M = 0.53; continuity: r = 0.93, M = 0.81 and r = 0.94, M = 0.89, respectively) more accurately than the modified Gorlin formula (r = 0.69, M = 0.49). In patients with low cardiac output, hemodynamic formulas, such as the Gorlin formula, which assume a constant value for the hydraulic discharge coefficient (Cd), may be less accurate than formulas using either a corrected value of Cd or Doppler-determined flow velocity and mean systolic flow.\r"

Conventional pulsed, continuous wave and Doppler color flow systems were used to detect flow in tubing placed diagonally within the water and maintained by a continuous pump. After control periods of flow detection within the tubing, six different prosthetic valves were interposed on a stage between the transducer and the tubing. In comparison with control measurements, detection of flow within the tubing was impossible when the Doppler beam traversed the central occluding ball of the Starr-Edwards Silastic prosthesis by any modality. Marked reduction in the detection of the Doppler signal was noted for the Starr-Edwards stellite prosthesis with only slight improvement in the ability to detect the flow signals through the central occluding discs of the Bjork-Shiley, Hall-Kastor and St. Jude valves. In distinction to the other valves, the ability of Doppler ultrasound to detect flow behind the cusps of the Carpentier-Edwards heterograft was similar to that during the control period. An understanding of flow masking should improve the clinical utility of Doppler methods for investigating prosthetic valve dysfunction.\r"

During electrophysiologic study, the effect of propafenone on the effective refractory period of the accessory pathway was determined, as well as its effect during orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Propafenone caused significant increases in the accessory pathway refractory period, both in the anterograde direction (290 +/- 19 versus 474 +/- 50 ms, p less than 0.05) and in the retrograde direction (238 +/- 15 versus 408 +/- 44 ms, p less than 0.05). Complete anterograde accessory pathway conduction block occurred in four patients. Sustained AV reentrant tachycardia was inducible in 11 patients before administration of propafenone. Drug infusion during AV reentrant tachycardia promptly terminated arrhythmia in 10 of these 11 patients and caused slowing of AV reentrant tachycardia in the remaining patient. Before propafenone, sustained atrial fibrillation was inducible in six patients and nonsustained atrial fibrillation in four patients. After propafenone, no patient had inducible sustained atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, propafenone caused a marked decrease in peak ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. Eight patients have been treated with oral propafenone and followed up for 12 +/- 2 months. All have remained virtually free of recurrent arrhythmia and none has developed significant side effects. Propafenone is a very promising agent for emergency intravenous therapy as well as long-term oral therapy in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\r"

At least 50% of 56 randomly selected patients with asthma had positive intracutaneous reactions to these insect extracts, and at least 80% of the skin reaction positive patients had specific IgE antibodies. An immunochemical assay of these insect-related aeroallergens in the dust collected 18.6 m above ground revealed the presence in the air of insect-related particles less than 10 microns in diameter with two peaks a year, one in the spring (silkworm wing, 3.18 ng protein equivalent to that of the crude extract per cubic meter of air; caddis fly wing, 3.08 ng/m3; and chironomid whole body, 5.21 ng/m3) and one in the autumn (silkworm wing, 8.24 ng/m3; caddis fly wing, 4.74 ng/m3; and chironomid whole body, 18.19 ng/m3). Although we have no idea whether or not such peak values are enough to cause asthmatic symptoms, seasonal fluctuations of specific IgE antibodies to these insects appeared to be similar to those of atmospheric insect allergens measured by this method. These findings suggest that insects are widespread and common inhalant allergens.\r"

This methodology was applied to the evaluation and comparison of inhaled metaproterenol and albuterol. The effects of two different doses of each drug (one and two inhalations of albuterol and two and four inhalations of metaproterenol from commercially available metered-dose inhalers) were compared with a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 13 subjects. The effects of metaproterenol and albuterol declined at rates that were not significantly different. However, based on the effects on activity ratio at 30 minutes, each puff of metaproterenol was an estimated 0.37 times as potent as each puff of albuterol (95% confidence limits, 0.22 to 0.52). In recommended two puff doses, measurable effects of albuterol persisted longer than effects of metaproterenol. However, this appears to be because of a greater initial effectiveness of two puffs of albuterol rather than differences in the rates at which the effects of the two drugs declined with time. Airway responsiveness thus appears to be a useful tool for evaluating inhaled beta 2-agonists and designing beta 2-agonist dosing regimens.\r"

Theophylline was stopped 24 hours and other bronchodilators at least 8 hours before the study day. Patients were evaluated for 8 hours after dose by spirometry and were monitored for adverse effects. All doses of azelastine produced bronchodilation with 4 mg greater than 2 mg greater than placebo; higher doses did not increase magnitude or duration of effect. We conclude that azelastine produces significant bronchodilation of long duration. The optimal dose appears to be 4 mg for adolescent and adult patients with asthma.\r"

  ".W": "The role of brown adipose tissue in the development and maintenance of obesity has been a recent focus of research efforts. Brown fat serves as a heat-producing tissue, via nonshivering and diet-induced thermogenesis, because of a unique mechanism that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. The importance of these forms of thermogenesis to energy balance has been characterized in animal models of obesity; increased metabolic efficiency has been attributed to impaired heat production and compositional and functional alterations in brown fat. Although the possibility exists that human obesity may partly result from inadequate thermogenesis, evidence that the defect is related to brown fat is tenuous. Currently, the contribution of brown fat to metabolic rate in human beings has been estimated as minor. However, even if it is found that differences in brown fat cannot explain differences in corpulence, interest in the tissue will likely continue. Because of its ability to waste calories, the potential for manipulating body weight by stimulation of brown fat remains a promising field of investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Western cultural factors, such as high socioeconomic status, early age of menarche, and late age at first pregnancy, may be risk factors in the development of breast cancer. A strong positive correlation exists worldwide between fat consumption and breast cancer. Case-controlled studies also support an association of a high-fat diet and breast cancer. Animal studies using rats or mice have verified that fat is a promoter of breast cancer after exposure to a known chemical carcinogen. A high-fat diet resulted in a higher incidence of breast tumors than a low-fat diet. Recent rodent studies further suggest that a reduction in calories alone reduces breast cancer incidence. Furthermore, studies reveal that the 5-year survival is about 80% after appropriate therapy (surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy) for breast cancer, with early detection by self-examination as the first step to improve outcomes. Excision of the breast tumor (segmental mastectomy) and some surrounding normal tissue followed by radiation therapy can be as effective therapy for most small breast cancers as total or radical mastectomy. The authors strongly recommend obtaining medical evaluation for any lump or thickening in the breast and following good dietary practices.\r"

Yet both its origins and its interpretation, in terms of conventional measurements, have long been obscure. The gauge, formally known as the Stubs Iron Wire Gauge, was developed in early 19th century England. Developed initially for use in wire manufacture, each gauge size arbitrarily correlates to multiples of .0010 inches. This sizing system was the first wire gauge recognized as a standard by any country (Great Britain, 1884). It was first used to measure needle sizes in the early 20th century. Today it is used in medicine to measure not only needles, but also catheters and suture wires. However, owing to the potential confusion inherent in using a gauge system, the iron wire gauge is rarely used in manufacture of nonmedical equipment.\r"

These modifications include multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) therapy, charcoal hemoperfusion, and a new \"superactive\" charcoal (SAC). Recent literature suggests using initial charcoal therapy instead of ipecac as a first-line antidotal agent for many acute poisonings. The palatability of charcoal slurries has been enhanced by the addition of carboxymethylcellulose, sucrose, saccharin, chocolate syrup, or sorbitol. The new SAC has shown to adsorb 1.7 to 4 times the amount of substance tested compared with other activated charcoal preparations. Multiple-dose activated charcoal therapy has been shown effective in treating phenobarbital, digoxin, digitoxin, theophylline, and dapsone intoxications, among others. The problems associated with charcoal hemoperfusion therapy have been partially alleviated, and it is now alternative therapy for the seriously intoxicated patient.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac dysrhythmias are easy. Unlike the lung (which has formidable neuroendocrine, metabolic, and respiratory responsibilities), the heart is simple. It is an innervated muscular pump. A resting Purkinje or ventricular muscle cell membrane maintains a charge of about 90 millivolts. The five phases of a cardiac action potential are similar to the action potential in skeletal muscle, however, the cardiac action potential lasts a hundred times longer. When sodium specific \"fast\" channels and calcium specific \"slow\" channels open, positive ions rush into the myocardial cell, thus causing rapid membrane depolarization. In order to produce an action potential, some stimulus must decrease the membrane potential from -90 millivolts to \"threshold\" or -60 millivolts. Purkinje fibers do not have a stable phase for diastolic potential. These fibers continuously depolarize during diastole. Hypoxemia or hypokalemia may exacerbate this diastolic depolarization, thus promoting \"hyperexcitability\" or \"automatic\" ectopy. When myocardium is damaged, characteristically with myocardial ischemia, rapid conduction of cardiac impulses may be slowed dramatically. Very slow impulses may course through muscle such that by the time the activation wave front returns to the initiating site, this origin has had a chance to repolarize. This is the basis for re-entrant dysrhythmias. All cardiac dysrhythmias are automatic, re-entrant or both.\r"

  ".U": "87223862\r", 
  ".W": "The two primary goals in dysrhythmia therapy are: to control the ventricular rate (between 70 and 100 beats per minute) and to maintain sinus rhythm. Maintenance of sinus rhythm is definitely secondary. If a patient is hemodynamically unstable, but has a ventricular rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute, the trouble is almost certainly not due to the cardiac rhythm. Normal conduction velocity is fast. An impulse is transmitted by healthy Purkinje fibers at 2 to 3 meters per second. This means that the entire ventricle, when activated by the Purkinje system, is activated in 80 milliseconds. When a superventricular impulse is transmitted to the ventricles via the A-V node, the ventricle should be activated (depolarized) in less than 80 milliseconds. Conversely, if an impulse is generated at an ectopic ventricular site, it does not access the high velocity Purkinje system as rapidly. A ventricular origin beat (PVC) thus, takes longer to activate the entire ventricle. The QRS is, therefore, longer (or wider). A wide QRS signifies aberrant ventricular conduction. When a dysrhythmia originates above the A-V node, the therapy is pharmacologic A-V nodal blockade (verapamil). When a dysrhythmia originates below the A-V node, therapy is pharmacologic (Lidocaine) or electrical (cardioversion). If uncertain or a patient is unstable, cardioversion is always acceptable. Thus; with an unstable patient, proceed immediately to cardioversion; with a narrow complex tachycardia (superventricular) proceed to verapamil; and with a wide complex (ventricular) tachycardia give Lidocaine and proceed to cardioversion.\r"

Thirty-gauge needles cause less needle-puncture pain than any other needle. The force required to bend the 30-gauge needle irreversibly was lower than that for the other needles. Studies of the fluid dynamics of different needle syringe assemblies demonstrated that the flow rate can be limited by using large-size syringes (30 mL) and needles with the smallest internal diameter. On the basis of the results of this study, 30-gauge needles attached to 10-mL syringes are recommended for infiltration anesthesia, and 25-gauge needles with 10-mL syringes are advocated for regional nerve blocks. In infiltration anesthesia, the local anesthetic agent should be injected slowly into the subdermal tissue over a 10-second period. When performing regional nerve blocks, it is also advisable to inject the local anesthetic agent over a 10-second time interval.\r"

  ".W": "The population dynamics of myeloid and lymphoid lineages during bursa of Fabricius ontogeny were analyzed by immunofluorescence by using two monoclonal antibodies (mAb). CL-1 mAb reacts with all chicken hemopoietic cells, except mature erythrocytes. L22 mAb reacts with bursa and bursa-derived lymphocytes, with a minor subset of macrophages and with some cells of the thymic medulla. The staining of embryonic bursas by these antibodies helps to distinguish between two different lineages of hemopoietic cells: CL-1+/L22+ cells represent B lymphocytes and a minor subset of macrophages, while CL-1+/L22- cells correspond to most of the macrophages and to the granulocytes, which disappear at the end of the embryonic life. CL-1+/L22- as well as CL-1+/L22+ cells were first observed outside the bursal rudiment. This indicates that there is a pre-bursal segregation between these two hemopoietic lineages and that two different kinds of precursors colonize the bursal rudiment at about the same time (day 9 for CL-1+/L22- cells and days 9 or 10 for CL-1+/L22+ cells). Moreover our data show that the colonization of the bursal epithelium by hemopoietic precursors is a two-step phenomenon. The first cells which enter belong to the CL-1+/L22- lineage, express Ia-like antigens at a high level, are dendritic in morphology, and represent cells of the macrophage/dendritic cell lineage. They are responsible for the formation of the epithelial bud which are then colonized by a small number of lymphoid precursors which belong to the CL-1+/L22+ lineage. Quail-chick bursa grafting experiments were also performed and the grafts were examined for CL-1 (restricted to chicken hemopoietic cells) and L22 reactivity. These observations confirmed our previous findings about the kinetics of the colonization of bursal rudiment by hemopoietic precursors and give support for a pre-bursal segregation between two hemopoietic pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-reactive recognition of alloantigen by \"self + X\"-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) has been documented in a variety of systems. It has been shown previously that the H-2Kb-restricted CTL response of C57BL/6 (B6) mice to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection is partially cross-reactive on uninfected target cells expressing the H-2Kbm8 mutation. In this report, we describe the isolation and detailed characterization of such dual-reactive CTL. By employing EL4 tumor lines transfected with genes encoding various VSV proteins, we demonstrated that the majority of dual-reactive CTL recognize the internal N protein of VSV and are also reactive against uninfected bm8 targets. Although the response of normal B6 mice to bm8 stimulators shows no measurable cross-reactivity on VSV-infected targets, the response of VSV-primed B6 mice to bm8 stimulation is almost entirely cross-reactive, lysing VSV-B6 targets and uninfected bm8 targets roughly equally. Furthermore, about 70% of CTL clones isolated from such mice by bm8 stimulation are dual-reactive with respect to effector function. Analysis at the population and clonal levels with cold target competition and antibody blocking suggests that the bulk of dual-reactive CTL have a higher avidity for VSV-B6 targets than for bm8 targets. The extreme case of this is illustrated by a fraction of CTL clones, isolated and maintained on bm8 stimulators, which lyse VSV-B6 targets but do not lyse bm8 targets. One such CTL clone is shown to be specific for the bm8 antigen in proliferation assays. These results demonstrate that: the specificity of an alloreactive CTL response may be dramatically altered by previous antigenic encounters; and dual-reactive CTL display a significant difference in affinity of the CTL receptor-determinant interaction, depending on the target which is recognized.\r"

Allograft function and the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) were monitored serially.

The MLR of these patients' post-transplant peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) against cryopreserved donor cells was compared with that against cryopreserved normal third-party cells. In control experiments, the MLR of cryopreserved pre-TLI recipient PBML or fresh normal PBML were tested against the same panel of donor and third-party stimulator cells. Seven of the nine recipients showed a pattern of specific unresponsiveness to the donor cells more than 18 mo after transplantation. Preliminary attempts to identify antigen specific suppressor cells were unsuccessful. The pattern of unresponsiveness may indicate a state of specific immune tolerance to the allogeneic graft.\r"

After 8 days in the presence of 30 U/ml of G-CSF and in the absence of IL 3, the great majority of 32D C13 cells becomes positive for myeloperoxidase (a marker that appears at the promyelocytic stage of the granulocytic lineage) and progressively differentiates into lactoferrin-containing neutrophilic granulocytes. Myeloperoxidase mRNA rapidly increases after 24 to 48 hr of treatment with G-CSF, peaks at day 6 and is no longer detectable at day 9 and 12, paralleling the appearance of myeloperoxidase-positive promyelocytes and myelocytes in the culture. After 12 days, 100% of the cells terminally differentiate, and clonogenic assays in IL 3-containing semisolid media indicate that the whole population has irreversibly lost proliferative capability. By using varying concentrations of both murine IL 3 and recombinant human G-CSF, the cultures develop an heterogeneous population of cells representing all the differentiation stages of the myeloid lineage, and the relative ratios of immature proliferating precursors and terminally differentiated cells present in the cultures can be modulated by modifying the concentrations of IL 3 or recombinant human G-CSF. Isobolic curves indicate that IL 3 and G-CSF have an antagonistic effect on the proliferation of 32D C13 cells. Thus, these cells represent a simplified in vitro model of normal granulocytic differentiation whose extent may be modulated completely in the presence of serum by two well-defined growth and differentiation factors: IL 3 and G-CSF.\r"

The biochemical features of this factor called HILDA (human interleukin DA) and the DA-2 nonresponsiveness to several human T cell lymphokines and cytokines lead us to the conclusion that this 41,000 m.w. glycoprotein could not be likened to already known T cell lymphokines. Highly purified HILDA turned out to be a potent chemoattractant and activator of, respectively, mouse and human eosinophils. It also displayed burst-promoting activity on human marrow.\r"

The neutrophils were found to contain 160 ng beta 2m/mg protein. Approximately two-thirds co-located with the markers for specific granules and was released from intact cells during degranulation, whereas one-third of the beta 2m was located together with markers of the plasma membrane. This fraction was not further enriched during degranulation. These results indicate that beta 2m cannot be universally used as a plasma membrane marker as hitherto assumed, but beta 2m may serve as an indicator of neutrophil degranulation.\r"

  ".W": "Although bacteria and/or bacterial products have been shown to induce interferon (IFN) production in cells of the immune system, the ability of non-lymphoid cells to produce IFN in response to bacterial products and/or bacterial invasion is currently unknown. In this study we examined murine and human fibroblasts for their ability to produce IFN in response to challenge with the invasive bacteria Shigella flexneri and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. Both human and murine primary cell cultures produced high levels (500 to 1000 U/ml) of IFN-beta within 12 hr after Shigella invasion. The production of IFN appeared to be dependent upon bacterial invasion because no IFN was produced by cells pretreated with a non-invasive isogenic variant of S. flexneri. Furthermore, UV treated invasive S. flexneri, which lose the ability to invade cells, failed to induce IFN production in fibroblasts after bacterial challenge. In contrast to primary cells, most human and murine continuous cell lines did not produce IFN in response to Shigella invasion. The above results demonstrate that bacterial invasion of primary cultures of fibroblasts can induce IFN production. Taken together with previous findings, these results suggest that IFN may play an important front line host defense against invasive bacterial infections.\r"

When the spontaneous or mitogen-driven polyclonal responses were examined, all groups produced significant amounts of IgM and IgG; those with TPE produced extremely high levels. However, when in vitro parasite antigen-specific responses were examined, those with MF were unable to produce filaria-specific antibody either spontaneously or in response to PWM or parasite antigen; in contrast, patients with chronic lymphatic obstruction or TPE produced large quantities. Removal of neither adherent cells nor T8+ T cells affected the parasite-specific B cell anergy seen in those with MF. This absent or severely diminished capacity to produce antibody on parasite antigenic stimulation in patients with MF is likely responsible for the low levels of parasite-specific antibody seen in this most common clinical manifestation of bancroftian filariasis. Its inability to be reversed by the removal of \"suppressor elements\" suggests a state of B cell unresponsiveness to the parasite.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rHuTNF-alpha) against Meth A sarcoma. Meth A sarcoma cells were found to a) be relatively insensitive in vitro to rHuTNF-alpha, and b) express low numbers of TNF-alpha receptors. Intraperitoneally implanted Meth A sarcoma was insensitive to the antitumor effects of rHuTNF-alpha. In contrast, rHuTNF-alpha was highly efficacious against subcutaneously implanted Meth A sarcoma. Biodistribution studies with 125I- or 3H-labeled rHuTNF-alpha demonstrated that, after intravenous administration, the majority of the labeled rHuTNF-alpha localized in the kidney, lungs, and liver. Only low levels of radiolabel were found in subcutaneous Meth A implants. These results support the in vitro data on the low number of TNF-alpha receptors on Meth A sarcoma cells. The ability of rHuTNF-alpha to induce regression of established (7 days) subcutaneous Meth A implants, positively correlated with the degree of both macroscopic and microscopic tumor necrosis. In addition, recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-beta (lymphotoxin) and recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced similar levels of necrosis. Other lymphokines with known antitumor activities, recombinant human interferon-gamma, murine interferon-gamma, and human interleukin 1 alpha, failed to induce detectable necrosis of Meth A sarcoma. Mice which had rejected subcutaneous Meth A sarcoma implants after rHuTNF-alpha treatment and which were later challenged subcutaneously with Meth A sarcoma or other noncross-reacting chemically induced sarcomas were found to be specifically immune to Meth A sarcoma. In addition, low levels of cytotoxic antibodies reactive to Meth A sarcoma were detected in the sera of 21 of 30 Meth A immune mice. Histological evaluation of the hemorrhagic tumor necrosis induced by rHuTNF-alpha suggests that the primary lesion is vascular, possibly directly on the endothelial cells. The mechanisms involved in the generation of specific cell-mediated antitumor immunity in this model are at present unknown.\r"

However, the in vitro cytotoxic titers of these monoclonal reagents do not correlate with their immunosuppressive potency when injected in vivo. A relationship nevertheless seems to exist between immunosuppression and the isotype of anti-mouse Thy-1 antibodies, because among several anti-Thy-1 antibodies of mouse and rat origin, the only two found to cause immunosuppression in vivo belonged to the rat IgG2b and mouse IgG2a isotype. We show here that a quantitative positive correlation exists between an antibody-induced humoral effector mechanism and immunosuppression. We measured the uptake of the C1q complement subunit by polyclonal rabbit and rat anti-thymocyte globulin and also seven monoclonal anti-Thy-1 antibodies in an immunohistochemical assay or a radioimmunoassay. Immunosuppression was studied in a murine graft-vs-host and skin allograft model. Our results suggest strongly that a stable association between the C1 protein and a potential binding antibody is an essential prerequisite of antibody-dependent cell inhibition in vivo that suppresses the immunoresponse against strongly incompatible transplantation antigens.\r"

This mast cell disappearance is accompanied by ultrastructural evidence of loss of granule contents. In this study, we followed cutaneous mast cells in chronic GVHD over 9 mo by three methods: Light microscopy of toluidine blue-stained sections showed that mast cells not seen at day 42 reappeared between days 94 and 125, were supramaximal at days 146 and 164, and returned to normal levels at days 195 and 280. Double immunofluorescent staining of mast cells for the presence of surface IgE receptors and cytoplasmic granules (avidin) revealed IgE receptor-bearing cells that lacked avidin-binding granules at the time when mast cells were not apparent on light microscopy. By electron microscopy, reappearing mast cells have the morphology of immature dermal mast cells. Ultrastructural abnormalities of mast cells persist some 150 days after GVHD induction. The possible relationship of these mast cell changes to the development of dermal fibrosis in chronic GVHD is discussed.\r"

Analysis of the interaction of 125I-labeled gamma-NGF with C1-Inh by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography indicated that a covalent bond was formed between gamma-NGF and C1-Inh. The covalent bond was hydrolyzed by hydroxylamine, which suggested that the two proteins were linked via an acyl linkage. The formation of this complex was time dependent and required the proteolytic activity of the gamma-NGF.\r"

In normal specimens, T mast cells predominated in the mucosa (89%), with a mean concentration of 17,850 +/- 4,998 per mm3 (+/- SD, n = 16), whereas TC mast cells predominated in the submucosa (90%) with a mean concentration of 7,516 +/- 1,227 per mm3 (+/- SD, n = 16). The concentrations of T and TC mast cells in specimens of ileum from five patients with active Crohn's disease and of colon from three patients with active ulcerative colitis were not significantly different (p greater than 0.4) from normal values. Three patients with combined immunodeficiency disorders demonstrated a marked decrease in the concentration of the T mast cells in the intestinal mucosa, to 540 +/- 630, and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of T mast cells to 9%. Concentrations of TC mast cells were unchanged, both in the mucosa and in the submucosa. In three patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, a similar deficiency of the T mast cell type was observed in the ileal mucosa, with a mean concentration of 788 +/- 534 T mast cells per mm3, but not in the appendiceal and colonic mucosa of one of the three patients. These findings indicate a role for functional T lymphocytes in the development of the T mast cell type in humans, and suggest divergent pathways for development of T and TC mast cells.\r"

The dual epitope designation of group antigen 3,4 is based on absorption data using polyvalent rabbit antisera. Five monoclonal antibodies specific for the Y antigen, generated after immunization of BALB/c mice or LOU/C rats, were selected on the basis of ELISA by using well-characterized S. flexneri Y LPS and chemically defined glycoconjugates. Chemically defined LPS from all S. flexneri serogroups, synthetic oligosaccharides, and saccharides obtained by phage Sf6-mediated hydrolysis of the O-polysaccharide were used either as free haptens or glycoconjugates in Farr assays and ELISA titrations. Two different patterns of antibody specificities were seen: two monoclonal antibodies had combining sites recognizing the terminal nonreducing end of the O-polysaccharide complementary to the tetrasaccharide repeating unit; and three antibodies bound to intrachain determinants and had larger combining sites, possibly accommodating at least an octasaccharide. The precise specificity of these two general types of antibodies indicate that variant Y polysaccharide generates more than two O-factors.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether the difference between the rate of intracellular killing of Salmonella typhimurium by macrophages of salmonella-resistant CBA and salmonella-susceptible C57BL/10 mice also holds for other salmonellae and other bacteria species. After in vivo phagocytosis, the initial rate of in vitro intracellular killing of S. typhimurium phagetype 505, S. typhimurium phagetype 510, and S. typhimurium M206 by macrophages of CBA mice amounted always to approximately 1.7 times the value found for macrophages of C57BL/10 mice (p less than 0.001), indicating that the difference in killing efficiency between CBA and C57BL/10 macrophages holds for various strains of S. typhimurium. However, some other salmonella species, i.e., S. dublin and S. heidelberg, as well as E. coli 054 and 02K1+, Listeria monocytogenes EGD and L347, and Staphylococcus aureus were killed equally efficiently by macrophages of both mouse strains. These findings indicate that the difference between the rates of intracellular killing by macrophages of salmonella-resistant CBA and salmonella-susceptible C57BL/10 does not hold for several other bacteria species and thus might be specific for S. typhimurium. Subsequent experiments showed that the in vivo proliferation of S. typhimurium 510 in the first 2 days after i.v. injection was 2.0-fold to 3.0-fold higher in the spleens and livers of C57BL/10 mice than in those of CBA mice, whereas the in vivo proliferation of S. dublin and S. heidelberg was between 1.0-fold to 1.4-fold higher in the C57BL/10 mice. These findings suggest that the differences between the rate of in vitro intracellular killing of salmonella by CBA and C57BL/10 macrophages are reflected in differences in the rate of in vivo proliferation of these microorganisms in CBA and C57BL/10 mice. To gain insight into the involvement of the oxidative metabolism of CBA and C57BL/10 macrophages in the difference in the rate of intracellular killing of S. typhimurium, the O2 consumption and H2O2 release by resident peritoneal macrophages was determined. The amplitudes of the respiratory burst and the release of H2O2 was identical in macrophages of the two mouse strains after triggering by either preopsonized heat-killed S. typhimurium or phorbol myristic acetate. These findings indicate that the mouse species-associated difference in the intracellular killing of S. typhimurium is not caused by a difference in the oxidative metabolism of CBA and C57BL/10 macrophages.\r"

IC started to appear at low concentrations 1 mo after infection and increased between 3 and 5 mo post-infection. Antibodies to fibronectin appeared after the second month but were not detectable 30 days later. Antibody activity to creatine kinase was detectable at the fourth month and became significantly higher at 5 mo post-infection. Reinoculation with a dose similar to that used for primary infection caused a significant increase in all antibodies and IC. Dissociation products of IC formed after primary infection consisted predominantly of treponemal antibodies and antigens, whereas IC detected after reinfection consisted predominantly of antibodies and normal rabbit serum proteins. Antibodies to fibronectin and creatine kinase are considered autoantibodies, and the underlying mechanism responsible for their production in syphilis is discussed.\r"

In contrast, mice immunized with killed promastigotes s.c. develop exacerbated lesions after infection. Both groups of mice produce only a low level of specific antibody and no detectable cytotoxic T cells, but do have a strong antigen-specific DTH, which is adoptively transferable with Lyt-1+2-, L3T4+ T cells. Kinetic and histological studies revealed that mice immunized s.c. developed Jones-Mote hypersensitivity, peaking at 15 hr. with little mononuclear cell infiltration at the site of antigen administration; whereas mice that had recovered from infection developed tuberculin-type of reactivity, peaking at 24 to 48 hr, with intense mononuclear cell infiltration. Splenic T cells from recovered mice, when injected into the footpads of normal recipients together with live promastigotes, were able to retard lesion development; whereas T cells from s.c. immunized mice, when similarly transferred, accelerated disease progression. Antigen-specific culture supernatant of spleen cells from recovered mice also activated normal resident peritoneal macrophages to kill intracellular L. major amastigotes and tumor cells. Culture supernatants of spleen cells from s.c. immunized or normal mice were devoid of such activities. Part of the macrophage-activating potential can be inhibited by antibody specific for IFN-gamma. These results therefore demonstrate that whereas the Jones-Mote reaction is correlated with disease exacerbation, the tuberculin-type of DTH may be protective. Furthermore, in vivo immunity is directly related to the capacity of T cells to produce macrophage-activating factor.\r"

This response was absolutely dependent on the enzyme activity of the serine esterase, but was found to be independent of generation of the chemotactic complement split product C5a. At high doses of urokinase (greater than 2 X 10(-12) M), no cellular infiltration was observed. Injection of 2 X 10(-10) M urokinase i.p. led to the systemic desensitization of mice when challenged in the skin with a lower dose (2 X 10(-14) M) of urokinase. Urokinase desensitization did not alter the ability of mice to respond to the chemical chemotactic factor f-met-leu-phe or to respond to C5a-dependent chemotactic stimuli. Urokinase desensitized mice failed to demonstrate a chemotactic response to nerve growth factor, thrombin, plasmin, or factor X activating enzyme, all of which were chemotactic in non-urokinase pre-treated animals. The results of these studies indicate the presence of three physiologically independent inflammatory pathways in mice: independent of C5 and not influenced by pretreatment with urokinase, independent of C5 and inhibited by pretreatment with urokinase, and dependent on C5 and not influenced by pretreatment with urokinase.\r"

  ".W": "Functional and structural studies of the activated proteins of the complement system C4b and C3b have led to the identification of cleavage products resulting from the effect of the regulatory proteins, factor I, H, and C4b binding protein (bp). In this paper we report the results of studies that investigated the capacity of plasma or serum from a wide range of phylogenetic species to yield similar cleavage products. Sera and plasma from mammals, reptiles, amphibia, and fishes are capable of cleaving fluid phase human C4b and C3b, generating apparently the same fragments as observed using normal human serum: alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4 from the alpha' chain of C4b: and alpha-68, alpha-46, alpha-43, and alpha-30 from the alpha' chain of C3b. When C3b bound to a cell membrane is used C3c and C3dg are generated. The generation of these fragments from C3bi is a dose-dependent reaction. There is no correlation between the evolution of the species and the quantitative capability to degrade the substrates. Birds possess only a limited capability to degrade the alpha' chain of C4b and have no cleaving activity for C3b, whereas sera from more primitive vertebrate species (chondrichthyes and agnatha) fail to participate in the reaction. Contrary to other species, the proteins in fish serum or plasma responsible for the degradation of C4b and C3b show a unique requirement for Ca2+ ions. Magnesium and barium are less effective, and in their presence a 65,000 dalton intermediate product is observed. These results demonstrate that protein(s) displaying proteolytic activity for products of complement activation, probably related to I, H, and C4bp, are present in plasma of species whose evolution have preceded humans by 300 million years. Moreover, the recognition of human substrates and the generation of fragments identical to those produced by human serum suggests that human C4b and C3b share structural characteristics with their evolutionary ancestors in the serum or plasma of the species studied.\r"

M5 protein stimulated AdoMet synthetase activity, whereas PHA had a biphasic effect with an early inhibitory effect and a later stimulatory effect on AdoMet synthetase activity. S-Carbamyl-L-cysteine (SCC), an inhibitor of human lymphocyte AdoMet synthetase, reduced AdoMet levels and inhibited the blastogenic response of PB lymphocytes to both M5 protein and PHA. Inhibition of the response to M5 protein was stronger than that to PHA. However, the inhibitory effects of SCC were totally reversible by washing the cells. It is our hypothesis that such differences in the biochemical events triggered by specific antigen as opposed to a polyclonal mitogen may determine the direction of the functional differentiation of T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The nematode parasite Toxocara canis is found in all dog populations and poses a poorly defined health hazard to humans. We have studied excretory-secretory antigen (ES) and surface antigens of the infective larval stage which is tissue-invasive in mammalian hosts. Antigens were probed with a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies raised in mice to whole ES. Six of eight antibodies reacted with periodate-sensitive carbohydrate epitopes on ES molecules, and the remaining two (Tcn-3 and Tcn-6) recognized either peptide or periodate-resistant sugar determinants. By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, the anti-carbohydrate monoclonals each reacted with several distinct ES molecules, known from previously published work to possess contrasting biochemical properties. Tcn-3 and -6 were directed predominantly against 32,000 and 120,000 m.w. molecules, respectively. Iodinated surface antigens of similar m.w. were precipitated by each antibody after detergent solubilization, but only two clones (Tcn-2 and -8) were able to bind exposed sites on the epicuticle of intact Toxocara larvae. Significantly, these antibodies do not bind to newly hatched larvae, and their target antigens are poorly expressed until the second day of in vitro cultivation. The specificities of the monoclonals were further studied by cold antibody inhibition of radiolabeled monoclonal binding, and by a matrix of two-site binding assays. These data show that Tcn-2, -4, -5, and -8 recognize a related group of repetitive carbohydrate epitopes, whereas Tcn-1, -6, and -7 bind discrete determinants on the same molecules. These studies are being continued to define further the structure of antigenic Toxocara carbohydrates and to compare the diagnostic utility of carbohydrate and peptide antigens.\r"

This MAb reacts with a high molecular weight glycoprotein detectable in human breast carcinomas and human milk. In contrast, MAb F36/22 was prepared against the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, MAb 115-D8 against human milk fat globule membrane (HMFGM) and MAb Ca1 against the HEp-2 human laryngeal carcinoma cell line. These MAb have similar patterns of reactivity with normal tissues and tumors based upon immunoperoxidase staining. In the present study we have monitored reactivity of these MAb against DF3 antigen purified from human breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7, BT-20) and HMFGM. Solid phase immunoassays and immunoblotting demonstrate that MAb DF3, F36/22, 115-D8, and Ca1 all react with the same purified DF3 antigen. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis indicates that the DF3 antigen reactive with these MAb differs structurally in preparations from breast carcinoma cells and HMFGM. We also demonstrate that MAb F36/22 completely inhibits MAb DF3 binding in competitive blocking assays. In contrast, the results indicate that MAb 115-D8 and Ca1 only partially block MAb DF3 reactivity and the extent of this inhibition varies with DF3 antigen purified from breast carcinoma cells and HMFGM. Taken together, these findings with multiple MAb prepared against a variety of immunogens suggest that existence of a family of related but not identical high molecular weight tumor-associated glycoproteins.\r"

  ".W": "We detected in human colon extracts a 40 kDa protein(s) that specifically reacts with tissue-bound IgG obtained from the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis or CCA-IgG. Using the hybridoma technology, we developed monoclonal antibodies to this 40 kDa protein. The specific immunoreactivity of one of the monoclonal antibodies (7E12H12, IgM isotype) against the 40 kDa protein was demonstrated both by ELISA and by immunotransblot. Competitive binding experiments showed that CCA-IgG inhibits the binding of 7E12H12 to the 40 kDa protein, suggesting the recognition of common epitope(s) on the 40 kDa protein by the monoclonal antibody and CCA-IgG. 7E12H12 was used to determine cellular localization of the 40 kDa protein. Biopsy tissue specimens from colon, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, liver, pancreas, lungs, kidneys, salivary, and mammary glands were obtained. Tissue specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde or in 10% formalin. Sections were sequentially incubated with the hybridoma supernatant, biotinylated anti-mouse IgM, avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. An unrelated hybridoma supernatant was used as control. The monoclonal antibody exclusively recognized colonic epithelial cells both in the crypt and on the luminal surface. Immunoreactivity was present on the plasma membrane chiefly along the basolateral areas of the cells. Plasma membrane localization of the 40 kDa protein was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. All colonic mucosal biopsy specimens from both adult and fetal colon reacted with the monoclonal antibody. None of the biopsy specimens from stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, liver, pancreas, or non-gastrointestinal tissue reacted with the antibody, confirming the organ specificity of the 40 kDa protein. The interaction between this colonic epithelial membrane protein and the CCA-IgG may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.\r"

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor activity in the migration assay was closely correlated with antibody reactivity. Using this antibody called 1C5/B, we are now able to study the expression of MIF in situ. Here, we report on the detection of MIF in blood lymphocytes and skin of a patient with a leukemic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with the characteristics of Sezary syndrome. Ninety percent of the patient's Ficoll Hypaque-isolated peripheral white blood cells were of the helper phenotype. By conventional immunoperoxidase method, 94% reacted strongly positive with the antibody 1C5/B. In contrast, using the immunofluorescence method only 25% reacted positive. This indicates that the majority of the tumor cells did not express the molecule on their membrane but only in the cytoplasma. No other marker, such as interleukin 2 receptor, HLA-DR antigen, or interferon-gamma could be related to the expression of MIF. Also the cellular infiltrate in the skin was composed mainly of T helper cells and reacted positive with 1C5/B. As less than 3% of normal blood lymphocytes reacted with 1C5/B we suggest that the conversion to positivity may be a characteristic feature of the leukemic T-cell phenotype in Sezary syndrome.\r"

Since nodular malignant melanoma and Spitz nevus can show a remarkably similar light microscopic appearance, but may differ in behavior, we studied typical examples of these neoplasms to determine whether cytometric differences existed. Analysis of relative DNA content alone could not discriminate between these 2 entities in the 13 cases that we examined. However, Spitz nevi and nodular melanoma clearly differed in terms of maturation, which we defined as the difference between the mean nuclear size or mean nuclear DNA content of the uppermost and deepest melanocytes in each lesion. Maturation as defined by a decrease in mean nuclear DNA content proved highly significant (p less than 0.005). Only Spitz nevi showed a lesser DNA content in the deepest dermal cells as compared with upper dermal cells, suggesting that some Spitz nevi have an admixture of diploid and hyperdiploid cells in their upper portions, but mostly diploid cells in their deep portions. Only nodular melanoma showed higher mean DNA content in deep dermal cells as opposed to superficial dermal cells, suggesting that some nodular melanomas may either have clones of cells in their deep portions that have higher levels of ploidy, or more cells in the deep portion of melanomas may be in active phases of the cell cycle. Our study suggests that important cytometric differences exist between Spitz nevi and nodular melanoma, and that these could be exploited to develop cytometry into an adjunctive clinical technique.\r"

  ".W": "Eight daily intraperitoneal injections of endotoxin (LPS) induced hematologic abnormalities in mice like those previously observed with chronic inflammation, sterile abscess, and tumor bearing. By the ninth day, anemia, leukocytosis, hypocellularity of the bone marrow, and compensatory hemopoietic hyperplasia of the spleen had occurred. The suppressed hemopoietic recovery and impaired survival of mice with these abnormalities, after receiving an ordinarily sublethal dose of total body irradiation (600 cGy T.B.), confirmed their importance to the intact mouse and suggested that splenic hyperplasia was insufficient to compensate for a total body deficit of functional hemopoietic stem cells. Atrophy of hemopoietic tissue in the marrow with hyperplasia in the spleen implicated changes in the hemopoietic microenvironment to account for the different responses to endotoxin. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) serves as an important mediator of the inflammatory response and profoundly affects hemopoiesis. Previous studies had shown that low concentrations of PGE2 enhanced, and high concentrations suppressed erythropoiesis in vitro; therefore, we wondered whether stromal cells from the marrow's microenvironment produced more PGE2 in response to LPS than splenic stromal cells to explain the suppression of hemopoiesis in the marrow and its enhancement in the spleen. Indeed, synthesis of PGE2 in primary short-term cultures of adherent marrow stromal cells in response to LPS proved much greater than that observed in cultures of splenic stromal cells. Extending adherence times from 3 to 24 to 48 hours did not change the relationship. We believe that the results of our studies point to a role of PGE2 in the microenvironmental modulation of hemopoiesis in mice with activation of the inflammatory response.\r"

Children with both Werdnig-Hoffmann and Kugelberg-Welander disease showed positive N-CAM reactivity. There were however differences in the N-CAM expression profiles in these two sets of patients. All myofibres were positive for N-CAM in the Werdnig-Hoffmann patients. This included both the normal sized fibres and the atrophic fibres. In contrast only the atrophic fibres were positive in the Kugelberg-Welander patients. No reactivity was found associated with the large hypertrophic fibres. It is likely that in the Werdnig-Hoffmann patients the positive N-CAM reactivity reflects unstable innervation of myofibres that had been previously innervated. A similar mechanism may operate in the Kugelberg-Welander patients, but the innervation of the hypertrophic fibres is more stable as they are able to repress N-CAM expression. These results contrast with a lack of N-CAM expression found previously on muscle biopsies from adults with denervation disease.\r"

Mechanical ventilators deliver pressurized gas to the patient's lungs by using a pattern of volume and timing that is preset by the clinician. A weakness of existing control methods is their emphasis on maintaining adequate gas exchange while poorly accommodating the patient's efforts to reassume control of the delivery pattern. A method is proposed to control airway pressure within a breath by making it respond to measurements of volume. This method using pressure as a function of volume, or P(V) method, permits the patient to have transient control over flow rate and delivered volume. In addition, an adaptive controller is included that modifies the applied pressure during subsequent breaths; it assures an average flow rate and delivered volume at the levels prescribed by the clinician, when sustained changes occur in airway resistance, lung-thorax compliance, or breathing efforts. Analyses and computer simulations suggest that the P(V) method will be better than conventional volume ventilation in accommodating, within a breath, transient breathing efforts without long-term degradation of the prescribed delivery pattern. The P(V) method can restore the delivery pattern, using the adaptive controller, within a few breaths after changes occur in the patient's lung mechanics. We conclude that the P(V) method is feasible, that it may represent an improved method of patient ventilation, particularly during fighting or weaning from the ventilator, and that it warrants further investigation.\r"

  ".U": "87225107\r", 
  ".W": "The term soft tissue sarcoma refers to a large variety of malignant tumors arising in extraskeletal connective tissues that connect, support, and surround discrete anatomic structures. All visceral organs also contain a connective stroma that can undergo malignant transformation. Because of the histological similarities of this group of tumors and their relative rarity, treatment prescriptions for patients that have disseminated disease are most often uniform. In this study, we asked the question whether adding a third drug (cyclophosphamide or actinomycin D) to Adriamycin (Adr [Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH])-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)- imidazole-4-carboxamide (DTIC) would improve the response rate and/or survival. A unique feature of this cooperative group clinical trial was the mandatory pathology review of the histological material. All patients of the Southwest Oncology Group between June 1, 1976, and November 17, 1979, who had a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma with convincing clinical or biopsy-documented evidence of metastatic disease were eligible for the study. Patients were randomized to receive (1) Adr, 60 mg/m2 intravenously, day 1, and DTIC, 250 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (104 patients); (2) Adr and DTIC as in (1) and cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2, day 1 (112 patients); or (3) Adr and DTIC as in (1) and actinomycin D, 1.2 mg/m2, day 1, (119 patients). There was no statistically significant difference in response rates (33%, 34%, and 24%) (P = .25). Median durations of response were 31 weeks in the Adr-DTIC arm, 26 weeks in the cyclophosphamide-DTIC-Adr arm, and 23 weeks in the Adr-DTIC-Actinomycin D arm (P = .78). Median durations of survival were 37, 42, and 50 weeks, respectively. Again, no statistically significant differences were observed (P = .59). Toxicities from each of these treatment arms were formidable and were equivalent. Prognostic factor analysis showed a prognosis based on bone marrow reserve, sex, and pathology subtype favorable to patients.\r"

This program resulted in a complete remission (CR) rate of 81%, a 5-year survival of 75%, and 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of 52% for all patients. Analysis of potential factors affecting treatment outcome revealed a significantly better CR rate for patients with small cleaved cell type (97%) than for patients with mixed (73%) or large-cell (57%) histologies. The 5-year survival was significantly better for patients with small cleaved (91%) and mixed (84%) cell types than for large cell (40%). In addition, bulky abdominal disease and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significant adverse prognostic factors for CR and for survival. Toxicity was moderate. No secondary leukemias have occurred. This combined modality regimen resulted in prolonged remission and potential cure for over half of patients who achieved CR, and is particularly encouraging for those with follicular small cleaved and mixed histologies.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients with clinical stage II nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis (NSGCTT) were treated with primary chemotherapy followed by a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) in selected patients. The study population included 34 patients with retroperitoneal masses and elevated levels of serum biomarkers (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [BHCG] ), five with needle aspiration biopsy-proven retroperitoneal metastases but normal levels of biomarkers, and 11 in whom there were rising levels of serum biomarkers but no radiographic evidence of retroperitoneal metastases. Forty-eight patients (96%) achieved a complete response (CR), with a mean disease-free survival of 132 weeks (range, 55 to 273 weeks). Two patients developed recurrent disease. One died and one achieved a second CR with further therapy (48 + weeks). Postchemotherapy RPLND was required in 11 patients (22%). Patients with embryonal carcinoma had a lower frequency of RPLND (8%) than patients with teratomatous elements in their primary tumor [36%, P = .014]. To reduce the frequency of double therapy (surgery +/- chemotherapy), we propose individualized therapy. Patients presenting with clinical stage II embryonal carcinoma of the testis should receive primary chemotherapy. Patients with clinical stage II NSGCTT and teratomatous elements in their primary tumor continue to require an RPLND. Those patients with intermediate volume disease (greater than 2 cm less than or equal to 5 cm in maximum diameter) may be treated with an RPLND only. Patients with higher volume teratomatous elements (greater than 5 cm less than or equal to 10 cm in maximum diameter) are likely to require the combination of chemotherapy and surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant biliary tract obstruction (MBTO) due to either primary biliary tract cancer or metastasis to the porta hepatis is a common clinical problem. The most common metastatic tumors causing MBTO in order of frequency are gastric, colon, breast, and lung cancers. Radiographic diagnostic procedures should proceed in a cost-effective sequence from ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTHC), and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography with the goal of establishing the site of the biliary tract obstruction. The identification of the site of obstruction could be established by ultrasound 70% to 80%, CT scan 80% to 90%, PTHC 100%, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) 85%. Therapeutic intervention by radiographic decompression (PTHC or endoscopic prosthesis), surgical bypass, or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy may be selectively used based on (1) the site of obstruction; (2) the type of primary tumor; and (3) the presence of specific symptoms related to the obstruction. (\"Prophylactic\" biliary tract decompression to prevent ascending cholangitis is not supported by the literature in that the frequency of sepsis in the face of malignant obstruction is small (in contrast to sepsis associated with stone disease). Furthermore, PTHC with drainage as a long-term procedure is associated with a substantial frequency of sepsis and is unnecessary and possibly problematic as a preoperative procedure simply to reduce the bilirubin level. The use of radiation therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy for patients not deemed suitable for a surgical bypass because of the presence of proximal obstruction is an important alternative to PTHC.\r"

  ".W": "A recent report described a pattern of \"reverse redistribution\" on poststreptokinase 201Tl studies which was believed to be due to rapid washout of 201Tl from the infarct area related to reperfusion of the infarct vessel. We have also observed the phenomenon of rapid washout of 201Tl from the area of infarction in the absence of thrombolytic therapy. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that rapid washout of 201Tl from an area of infarction is an artifact of background subtraction usually employed in analysis of washout. A total of 61 patients with previous myocardial infarction who underwent cardiac catheterization and exercise 201Tl imaging were examined. Thallium-201 images were analyzed using a validated quantitative method employing interpolative background correction. Abnormally increased 201Tl washout was noted in 11 infarct segments in 10 (18%) patients. Infarct segments with rapid washout had significantly less initial uptake, and more severe associated wall motion abnormalities than infarct segments with normal washout. When quantitative analysis was repeated without background subtraction, no segments with rapid washout were observed. A phantom model was constructed to further test our hypothesis. The frequency of observed rapid washout was directly related to the severity of the initial defect and was entirely dependent upon utilizing background correction during the quantitative analysis. Our study suggests that rapid washout of 201Tl in an area of previous infarction reflects an artifact of background subtraction involved with standard quantitative analysis.\r"

This tetrasaccharide was subjected to an array of in vitro tests designed for the assessment of potential sugar substitutes before animal or human studies. beta-Fructosidase from yeast cleaved nystose at about 5% of the initial rate observed with sucrose. The terminal fructose was released first. Glycosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans #620 did not utilize nystose for the formation of a glucan-type polysaccharide. Anaerobic fermentation of nystose by a suspension of mixed dental plaque microorganisms and by S. mutans NCTC 10449 was about half as fast as with sucrose. Thin-layer chromatography at various reaction times with S. mutans NCTC 10449 indicated the terminal fructose as the site of first attack. Analyses for free monosaccharides confirmed these data because free fructose exceeded free glucose at early reaction times far more than would follow from the 3:1 ratio of fructose to glucose in the nystose molecule. High pressure liquid chromatography assays demonstrated lactic and acetic acids as the main fermentation products. Carbohydrases from human jejunal mucosa did not attack nystose. However, cecal anaerobic microorganisms of the rat fermented nystose rapidly into acids.\r"

At 21, 42, 63 and 84 d of age, chicks from each population were intubated with glucose (2 g/kg body wt) following a 24-h fast. Blood was collected at 20-min intervals up to 100 min postadministration. At all ages, the LW chicks were better able to clear glucose from their blood than were their HW counterparts, and the HL chicks exhibited intermediate responses. Impaired glucose tolerance in the HWs and HLs was not associated with insulin insufficiency; the HWs and HLs, in comparison to the LWs, exhibited higher plasma concentrations of insulin at 42 and 63 d of age and plasma insulin levels did not differ significantly among populations at 21 or 84 d of age. Plasma immunoreactive glucagon responses to glucose intubation were inconsistent at the different ages; however, concentrations were consistently higher in the HWs and HLs than in the LWs. It was concluded that excessive fat deposition in chickens selected for rapid growth is associated with increased concentrations of insulin and glucagon in plasma and perhaps insulin resistance.\r"

Target prothrombin time ratios were selected by the physicians. Study endpoints included: the time to reach a therapeutic prothrombin ratio, the time to reach a stable therapeutic dose, the number of patients transiently overanticoagulated, the number of bleeding complications, and the accuracy of the predicted maintenance dose, which was assessed at steady-state 10-14 days later. Computer-assisted dosing consistently out-performed the physicians: a stable therapeutic dose was achieved 3.7 days earlier (p = 0.002), fewer patients were overanticoagulated (10% versus 41%), and the predicted maintenance dose was in the therapeutic range in 85% of the computer-dosed patients versus 42% of the physician group (p less than 0.002). For physicians who did not routinely manage warfarin therapy, computer-assisted dosing improved the accuracy of dosing and shortened the time required to achieve a stable therapeutic dose.\r"

Throughout the observation period, patient serum potassium concentrations were significantly higher than normal, paralleled by a significant increase in plasma aldosterone concentration but with normal excretion fraction of sodium and potassium. There were no disturbances of acid-base balance. These findings may be accounted for by a persistent partial reduced sensitivity of the distal tubule to the action of aldosterone despite normal renal function. This alteration is usually mild, but may constitute a persistent metabolic risk despite successful surgical intervention.\r"

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were the most commonly isolated pathogens (22% of total). Patients given TMP-SMX had a significantly shorter time to \"last illness stool\" than did those given placebo, but no difference in number of unformed stools in 5 days was found between treatment groups. However, TMP-SMX significantly shortened the illness in patients with fever or many fecal leukocytes. When stool cultures positive for any bacterial pathogen or for enterotoxigenic E. coli were analyzed as separate groups, a significantly faster recovery was observed in patients given TMP-SMX. TMP-SMX is efficacious in the treatment of Mexican children with diarrhea and culture-proved bacterial infection or when the clinical signs and symptoms suggest bacterial enteritis.\r"

Evidence of the developmental nature of health cognition and HLOC was documented. Contrary to the effect of experience in formal learning, experience with chronic disease did not alter developmental progression in these health-related areas. Our results suggest that in communicating with children about illness, the pediatrician's approach should not be altered by an appearance of superficial sophistication that some children may acquire as part of their experience with chronic disease.\r"

A complete clinical, biochemical and radiographic assessment was made in each patient before biopsy. Only 1 biopsy (1.6 per cent) yielded tissue inadequate for evaluation, while another biopsy caused a renal artery pseudoaneurysm that ruptured and resulted in graft loss. In 27 of these 64 biopsies (42 per cent) the results differed from the pre-biopsy diagnosis and directly affected patient management, particularly the use of steroids. The remaining biopsy specimens were helpful to confirm uncertain clinical impressions, and allowed accurate counseling for patients and family. Biopsies were of special usefulness in separating acute rejection from complications, such as acute tubular necrosis, cytomegalovirus infections, recurrence of original disease, cyclosporin toxicity and acute superimposed-upon chronic rejection. Of 64 biopsies 22 (34.3 per cent) demonstrated the absence of rejection and 8 demonstrated chronic rejection (12.5 per cent), thereby averting the use of steroids in 46.8 per cent of the patients. All patients with evidence of severe small vessel disease and/or antibody-mediated rejection eventually lost the grafts, including 2 with cytomegalovirus glomerulopathy who also suffered such vascular changes. These data highlight the extreme usefulness of needle biopsy in the evaluation and management of renal allograft dysfunction.\r"

Of these patients 171 underwent simultaneous radical cystectomy for cancer, 60 had had a previous urinary diversion of another type and 19 had a neurogenic bladder. Our experience represents a series of expected complications and ongoing modification to the surgical technique. A total of 42 patients (16 per cent) suffered early complication resulting in an operative mortality rate of 2 per cent (5 of 250). One or more late complications necessitating 85 revisions occurred in 77 patients (31 per cent). The end result has been an overwhelming success tempered only by the need for reoperation. It is believed that the surgical modifications described will decrease further the incidence of late complications. The basic surgical premise as conceived by Kock remains a low pressure, high capacity reservoir with continent and nonrefluxing valves that can be constructed from ileum. The concept is sound and offers a genuine alternative to the patient who requires cutaneous urinary diversion.\r"

Adequate trials of this substance in a clearly defined organically impotent population are not available. We conducted a randomized, controlled study with partial cross-over of yohimbine versus placebo in 100 organically impotent men. The first phase of the study showed a positive response in 42.6 per cent of the patients receiving yohimbine versus 27.6 per cent in the placebo group. Although favorable to the test medication these values did not reach statistical significance (p equals 0.42). A similar pattern was noted in the second phase of the study. The over-all response rate of 43.5 per cent was consistent with a previous noncontrolled trial but it was much lower than previous studies. The response rate of organically impotent patients to yohimbine is at best marginal. Owing to its ease of administration, safety and modest effect it still is used in those patients who do not accept more invasive methods. Adrenoceptors are involved in the erectile process, although other neurotransmitter systems also are putative modulators of penile erection, including cholinergic, dopaminergic and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide pathways. It is beyond reasonable expectation that a single agent be of value for all cases of organic impotence. However, yohimbine has shown modest effectiveness at the doses used in this trial (18 mg. per day). Higher doses or a different route of administration may produce different effects.\r"

These antibodies react preferentially with human bladder tumors and transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) cell line 647V. We now report that monoclonal antibody E7 detected the presence of antigen in midgestational and third trimester amniotic fluids, and in urine of patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma. Western blot analysis showed that the antigen present in amniotic fluids consists of a sharp band with molecular weight greater than 200 kdaltons. A similar molecular weight pattern was seen with the solubilized membrane of 647V. A sensitive and convenient sandwich ELISA was developed and the urine of patients with bladder cancer was assayed for the presence of the E7 antigen. Antigen was detected in the urine of patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma but not in the urine of normal adults or in urine from patients with prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or benign prostate hyperplasia. An inhibition enzyme immunoassay was developed with monomeric forms of the E7 antibody and confirmed the presence of antigen in the urine of patients with TCC. We conclude that the E7 antigen is an onco-fetal antigen expressed in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.\r"

Power frequency spectrum analysis (PFSA) was done on continuous-wave Doppler signals in the common femoral artery of 86 limbs in 50 patients before and after postocclusive reactive hyperemia testing in an effort to differentiate hemodynamically significant from insignificant proximal occlusive disease, whether in isolation or in combination with hemodynamically significant distal disease. Limbs were assigned to four different categories according to their angiographic findings. With the use of a bandwidth at 50% peak amplitude (f50%) of 2000 Hz as the cut-off point between a positive and a negative examination, the test was 93% sensitive, 90% specific, and 92% accurate in distinguishing hemodynamically significant proximal lesions from hemodynamically insignificant lesions, regardless of distal disease. In addition, there exists a small group with significant disease at or close to the site of Doppler sampling, which produces f50% values of more than 3000 Hz. Diagnosis in this subgroup was much like that in carotid disorders. Finally, the predictive accuracy of standard noninvasive Doppler/segmental pressure measurement was compared with results of PFSA. In most patients, standard measurements were comparable; however, in the subgroup with hemodynamically significant proximal and distal disease, the PFSA technique accurately predicted hemodynamically significant proximal diseases in 93% of patients, where combined pressure/Doppler testing had an accuracy of only 61%. In all, spectrum analysis of common femoral artery velocity signals can greatly aid in determining the presence or absence of significant proximal disease in all situations.\r"

The present study involved 100 consecutive women with no known prior history of vascular disease, who responded to an advertisement for free evaluation of the venous status of their legs. The subjects, all of whom wore commercial support hose routinely, were screened for the presence of venous disease by means of Doppler ultrasonography, phleborheography, and a detailed history focusing on risk factors and unrecognized symptoms of venous disease. Photoplethysmography (PPG) was then used to evaluate the efficiency of venous return from the lower extremity with and without the support hose in place. Worsening of PPG results occurred in 43% of the women with commercial stockings in place, whereas 23% improved and 34% showed no change. Women 50 years of age and older had a somewhat higher tendency toward poorer PPG results while wearing the support hose. Furthermore, measurements in women who showed evidence of venous disease by an abnormality in one or more of the screening tests were significantly different from the overall group (p = 0.025): 61% exhibited worsening of PPG results when wearing stockings, only 14% showed improvement, and 25% were unchanged. These results suggest that the use of a commercial support hose may be particularly deleterious to older women and is contraindicated in those with evidence of venous disease in the lower extremity.\r"

This experience suggests the need to consider the possibility of proximal vein occlusion in selecting arteriovenous fistula sites and, rather than abandoning the fistula, allowing it to serve to protect patency of a proximal bypass.\r"

Twenty-one patients had received transplants--15 bone marrow recipients, five renal allograft recipients, and one liver transplant recipient--while the other ten were immunocompromised due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (six), hematologic malignancies (three), and systemic lupus erythematosus (one). They presented with one or more of the following syndromes: CMV pneumonitis (19), CMV of the gastrointestinal tract (six), CMV retinitis (seven), and CMV hepatitis (three). Seventeen (55%) of 31 patients demonstrated clinical improvement during ganciclovir therapy, with the best response seen in the transplant recipients. Viremia ceased in 14 (93.3%) of 15 patients after a mean of 4.7 days of therapy; viruria ceased in eight (53.3%) of 15 patients after a mean of 11 days of therapy. Ganciclovir plasma concentrations at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg/three times a day were as follows: mean peak, 16.04 mumol/L; mean trough, 2.38 mumol/L. Neutropenia occurred in 11 (35%) of 31 patients and in nine (60%) of 15 bone marrow transplant recipients. We conclude that ganciclovir exerted an antiviral effect against CMV and may play a role in the treatment of CMV disease in patients with depressed immunity, especially bone marrow and organ transplant recipients.\r"

Nutritional support should be strongly considered if the patient has evidence of malnutrition by nutritional assessment or has a high likelihood of becoming malnourished by virtue of severe, prolonged critical illness. General nutritional goals in the intensive care unit include maintenance of body weight and lean body mass. Proper nutritional therapy includes assessment of adequate caloric requirements and appropriate protein, carbohydrate, and fat composition of the nutritional support. Nutritional therapy should be closely monitored with body weight and nitrogen-balance measurements.\r"

This resulted in a significant reduction in the average number of lesions per subject that progressed (P less than .03) and the percentage of subjects with new atheroma formation (P less than .03) in native coronary arteries. Also, the percentage of subjects with new lesions (P less than .04) or any adverse change in bypass grafts (P less than .03) was significantly reduced. Deterioration in overall coronary status was significantly less in drug-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects (P less than .001).

Nutritional support, provided at approximately 30 nonprotein calories/kg and 0.21 g nitrogen/kg ideal weight, did not differ between groups. Despite greater nitrogen loss and muscle breakdown evidenced by increased 3-methylhistidine-to-creatinine ratio and loss of arm muscle area by study end in the 45% BCAA, no statistical differences were observed when nitrogen balance was compared by week and within stress level as defined by organ and infectious complications. It is likely the patients in the 45% BCAA experienced greater metabolic stress by study end. Serum prealbumin and day posttransplant to peripheral engraftment also did not differ between groups. The chances (power) of this study exceeded 85% in detecting a difference in nitrogen balance of 2.5 g during study week 1 and 4.0 g during week 2. The power during week 3 was 77% for detecting a difference of 4.0 g, and it is unlikely that the true difference exceeds this magnitude. Thus, we did not find any evidence that intravenous BCAA-enriched solutions improved nitrogen balance during the first month after marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "87226975\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, several investigators have demonstrated that the MN blood group precursor antigens Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T-Ag) and Tn-antigen (Tn-Ag) are expressed on the cell surfaces of several cancers, including urinary bladder cancer. T-Ag is composed of a specific carbohydrate chain, galactose-beta-1-3-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), which is specifically detectable through the immunohistochemical binding of peanut agglutinin (PNA). In normal cells, T-Ag is cryptic (cT-Ag) and can be unmasked by treatment with neuraminidase. Tn-Ag is composed of another carbohydrate chain, alpha-GalNAc-serine/threonine, and binds specifically to Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA). With the use of both these lectins, VVA and PNA, the presence or absence of Tn-Ag and T-Ag was examined in 24 specimens of normal bladder epithelium and specimens from 53 cases of human urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma of various histologic grades by staining paraffin sections by means of the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique. The correlation between the expression of these antigens and the patient's clinical course was then estimated. Out of 21 patients in whom the tumors expressed the phenotype Tn-Ag(+), T-Ag(+), or cT-Ag(-), 17 suffered from invasive recurrence. Although patients with tumors expressing the phenotypes T-Ag(-) and cT-Ag(+) have been reported to show a good clinical course, in our studies some of them showed a switch to invasive recurrence. Thus it was not possible to estimate the patient's clinical course only by the presence or absence of T-Ag and cT-Ag. The expression of Tn-Ag was then examined with the use of VVA. Of 38 cases expressing the phenotypes T-Ag(-) and cT-Ag(+), 6 had tumors that carried Tn-Ag; 5 of them suffered from invasive recurrence. These results indicated that the detection of Tn-Ag with the use of VVA in combination with the examination of T-Ag and cT-Ag is useful for estimating the degree of malignancy of bladder cancer and the patient's clinical course.\r"

For identification of NK cells, VEP 13 (DC 16) monoclonal antibody was used. The receptor for PNA lectin was shown exclusively after neuraminidase treatment of cells, and VEP 13 antigen was neuraminidase resistant. The majority of VEP 13+ cells showed coexpression of lectin receptors for PNA, LEN, and WGA. Our results suggested that VEP 13 antigen and PNA receptor are two distinct membrane structures, whereas there is some competitive binding between LEN as well as WGA lectin and VEP 13 antibody. In double-marker experiments using PNA and LEN lectin, the small fraction of VEP 13+ cells lacking receptors for these lectins was found. In spite of neuraminidase treatment of the cells, no binding of SBA and ASP was shown. These results indicated apparent heterogeneity of NK cells with respect to lectin receptor expression. WGA lectin, which bound to all VEP 13+ cells, could probably be useful for isolation of NK cells.\r"

  ".W": "Epithelial cell lines isolated from benign rat mammary tumors converted to elongated cells that showed some aspects of myoepithelial differentiation. This cellular conversion was blocked in cells isolated from malignant tumors. For investigation of the pathway of the conversion, a rat mammary epithelial cell line (Rama 25) that converted to elongated cells through a series of morphologically distinct intermediates was isolated. These intermediates formed a series in the order: Rama 25, Rama 25-I2, Rama 25-I1, Rama 25-I4, and elongated cells. These cell lines were examined for aspects of myoepithelial or mesenchymal differentiation with the use of a polyclonal antibody to type IV collagen and a keratin monoclonal antibody, LP34 (myoepithelial markers), or a polyclonal antibody to type I procollagen (mesenchymal marker) for cells grown on plastic or as tumors in nude mice. The more epithelial-like cell lines Rama 25 and Rama 25-I2 produced relatively small amounts of type IV collagen and did not stain with LP34 or anti-type I procollagen. The flatter, polygonal cell line Rama 25-I1 stained more strongly with the antibody to type IV collagen but did not stain with anti-type I procollagen. Rama 25-I1 cells, and to a lesser extent Rama 25-I4 cells in tumors, contained a network of cytoplasmic filaments that stained strongly with LP34. The elongated cells, Rama 25-I4 and Rama 25-floaters (Rama 25-FL), did not stain with LP34 in vitro but produced an extracellular matrix that stained with antibodies to both type I procollagen and type IV collagen. The results obtained with these marker proteins suggested that, in this series of morphologic intermediates, the myoepithelial phenotype was best expressed in Rama 25-I1 cells and to a lesser extent in 25-I4 cells. However, this phenotype was relatively unstable, converting to elongated cells, some of which have decreased myoepithelial and increased mesenchymal characteristics. Such a pathway may explain the mixed population of cells seen in some types of benign mammary tumor.\r"

Twenty-three children had bilateral renal involvement with at least five cysts (ADPKD), 28 children were classified as suspicious (SADPKD), and 103 children had no renal involvement (NADPKD) detected by ultrasound. Seventy-four percent of the ADPKD children had signs or symptoms compatible with the diagnosis of ADPKD, compared to 34% of the NADPKD and 36% of the SADPKD children (both P less than 0.05). Three of the 23 ADPKD children had elevated serum creatinines at the time of diagnosis, while all of the NADPKD and SADPKD children had normal renal function. Renal area by ultrasonography (width X depth) was greater among the ADPKD children compared to the SADPKD and NADPKD groups (P less than 0.05). On follow-up 30 of the 37 NADPKD children remained NADPKD, three were reclassified as SADPKD, and four progressed to ADPKD after 18 years of age. All of the NADPKD children had normal renal function on follow-up. Overall, 14 children had suspicious ultrasounds at some point with follow-up ultrasonography and ten (71%) progressed to ADPKD. All SADPKD children maintained normal renal function. Eight of 18 ADPKD children had progression of the disease manifested by development of hypertension and/or decreased renal function. Three children progressed to end-stage renal disease. Five ADPKD children were diagnosed before one year of age, two of them via prenatal ultrasonography.

In euglycemia, RPF was higher and calculated renal vascular resistance (RVR) lower in the hyperfiltering than the normofiltering group (P less than 0.05 for both variables), but filtration fraction (FF) was similar in all groups. During hyperglycemia, mean GFR rose significantly from 157 +/- 20 to 174 +/- 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (11.9%; P less than 0.05) in the hyperfiltering group only. There was no statistically significant change in mean GFR in the normofiltering diabetic (116 +/- 6 vs. 114 +/- 13 ml/min/1.73 m2) and the normal control groups (117 +/- 15 vs. 113 +/- 14 ml/min/1.73 m2). RPF and FF rose by 5.8% and 9.2%, respectively, in the hyperfiltering group only, with no change in the normofiltering or normal control groups. No change in RVR was found in any group. Total tubular sodium reabsorption was higher during euglycemia in the hyperfiltering diabetics (P less than 0.01), and rose significantly during hyperglycemia (P less than 0.05) in this group only. Overnight euglycemia did not remove the increased glomerular filtration and flow of hyperfiltering diabetics. Hyperglycemia further accentuated hyperfiltration by elevating renal plasma flow and filtration fraction.\r"

  ".W": "Compared to many forms of hypertension, vascular reactivity to angiotensin II (AII) is decreased in the early phase of two-kidney, one clip (2-K, 1C) renovascular hypertension (RVH). To determine the role of the AII receptor, we examined vascular responsiveness and 125I-AII binding to mesenteric artery membrane fractions after three weeks of 2-K, 1C RVH. Systolic blood pressure was 165 +/- 8 in RVH and 105 +/- 4 mm Hg in controls, P less than 0.001. Plasma renin activity was 4.2 +/- 0.6 in RVH and 1.4 +/- 0.5 ng AI/ml/hr in controls, P less than .001. The pressor response to exogenous AII was reduced by 40% in RVH. Since administration of a single dose of converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) did not normalize the response to exogenous AII, the decreased reactivity was not caused by receptor occupancy. 125I-AII binding to mesenteric arteries was equal to or greater in RVH than controls at all concentrations of AII. Scatchard analysis revealed an increase in the total number of binding sites (BMAX): 140.8 +/- 6.3 in RVH versus 91.7 +/- 6.5 fmol/mg in controls, P less than 0.01, while the apparent dissociation constant was unchanged. To determine if the increase in circulating AII caused these binding alterations, rats were either treated with CEI for three days; or unilaterally nephrectomized. Both of these manipulations reversed the decrease in vascular responsiveness as well as the increase in receptor number (BMAX = 136 +/- 13.4 in RVH vs. 94 +/- 9.4 fmol/mg in RVH + nephrectomy, P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three children received a total of 38 renal transplants (18 living related donor, and 20 cadaveric) after being on CAPD and/or CCPD (PDPD). Ten patients (12 transplants) were converted to hemodialysis pre-transplant in order to be free of the risk of peritonitis and off antibiotics, whereas 23 patients (26 transplants) were on PDPD at the time of transplant. The latter group of patients are described in greater detail. Within this group there was one episode of catheter colonization with Flavobacterium, and only three patients developed ascites post-transplant. Of the 26 transplants, catheters were removed at the time of transplant in the 13 LRD allografts but left in situ for a mean of 3.8 weeks in the 13 cadaveric transplant recipients. Peritoneal dialysis was required post-transplant in seven patients (two LRD recipients requiring a new catheter placement) without complications. Our policy of removing PD catheters at the time of transplant in LRD recipients and prior to hospital discharge in cadaveric transplant recipients has resulted in the avoidance of additional hospitalizations in 19 of the 26 transplants and avoided extra surgery in 11 of the 13 LRD transplants. We conclude that children who have been on PDPD are suitable candidates for renal transplantation and that the early removal of PD catheters, including removal at the time of transplantation in LRD recipients, is associated with a significant reduction in operative procedures for the patients.\r"

  ".W": "In experimental animals, a high protein diet has been shown to accelerate end-stage renal disease by inducing glomerular hyperperfusion. In this study, we found that intravenous administration of amino acid, used as one component of parenteral nutrition, to normal volunteers resulted in a significant increase in renal blood flow (from 517 +/- 29 to 754 +/- 60 ml/min) and glomerular filtration rate (from 106 +/- 6 to 165 +/- 12 ml/min) without altering systemic blood pressure, renal excretion of electrolytes, plasma renin activity, or plasma aldosterone concentration, and excretory rates of prostaglandins E2 were increased (from 665 +/- 61 to 1,034 +/- 153 pg/min). These amino acid-induced renal hemodynamic effects were abolished when the volunteers received a low sodium diet (20 mEq/day) for three days before the amino acid infusions. However, the hemodynamic effects were restored when the subjects receiving low sodium diets were pretreated with captopril. Under these conditions, amino acid infusions increased renal blood flow (from 388 +/- 11 to 597 +/- 27 ml/min) and glomerular filtration rate (from 80 +/- 4 to 118 +/- 9 ml/min). Reduction of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin in volunteers receiving a normal sodium intake was also capable of significantly decreasing the amino acid effects on renal hemodynamics. The results indicate that the renal hemodynamic effects of amino acid infusion are strongly influenced by angiotensin II and prostaglandin formation.\r"

Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated the distribution of peptide hormones in the tumor. This case illustrates two important points.

Secondary, it adds yet another case to the unusual group of patients described by Carney (Carney JA: Cancer 43:374-382, 1979).\r"

Of the 22 who were treated for 12 months the increment in height velocity was maintained in 13 (3.4[0.4] cm/yr). Withdrawal of clonidine for 6 months did not stop the stimulatory effect of the drug on linear growth in 6 children, but in the other 8 children height velocities fell to pretreatment levels or below. In a few children reinstitution of clonidine for 2-4 months resulted in a new increment in height velocity. A high height standard deviation score and low growth velocity before treatment were predictive of a good growth response to clonidine. Clonidine did not induce noticeable side-effects. It may be a useful form of therapy for children with CGD.\r"

HIV antibodies were detectable by all the assays within 2 months after onset of illness. RIPA and western blot were more sensitive than the other assays--all serum samples obtained at 2 weeks and after were reactive. In all cases, the first serum sample reactive by RIPA precipitated gp160 whereas, by western blot, antibodies to p24 were first recognised. This study shows the necessity of including gp160 and p24 in any assay to detect early antibody response in primary HIV infection. 5 patients were studied by virus isolation. During the 2 first weeks after onset of symptoms, HIV was demonstrated in cell-free plasma in all cases and, in 4 cases, also in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Samples obtained later contained demonstrable infectious virus in only 1 of 4 cases. Thus a phase of viraemia precedes the antibody response in symptomatic primary HIV infection.\r"

No serious adverse reactions occurred. Antibodies that reacted with P falciparum sporozoite antigens by enzyme-linked immunoassay developed in twelve of the volunteers. The highest antibody titres induced were similar to those resulting from lifelong natural exposure to sporozoite-infected mosquitoes. Postimmunization serum samples from a majority of volunteers mediated the circumsporozoite (CS) precipitation reaction and inhibited sporozoite invasion of hepatoma cells in vitro. Serum from the three volunteers who received 800 micrograms doses reacted with the surface of sporozoites in an immunofluorescence assay. Six immunised volunteers receiving a fourth dose of FSV-1 and two non-immunised controls were challenged by bites of mosquitoes infected from cultured P falciparum gametocytes. Parasitaemia did not develop in the volunteer with the highest titre of CS antibodies, and parasitaemia was delayed in two other immunised volunteers. This study confirms that human beings can be protected by CS protein subunit vaccines and provides a framework for the further development and testing of more immunogenic sporozoite vaccines.\r"

Prevaccination rotavirus neutralising antibody levels were high. 84/185 infants (45%) showed an increase in neutralising antibody titre after receiving rotavirus vaccine, compared with 20/91 (22%) unvaccinated infants. Clinical rotavirus infection was detected in 24/78 (31%) children in the rotavirus/oral polio group, 34/83 (41%) children in the placebo/oral polio group, and 23/92 (25%) children in the rotavirus/killed polio group, giving an overall vaccine efficacy of 33% (95% CI 4-53%). RIT 4237 did not appear to reduce the severity of clinical infections. Most cases (92%) were caused by rotaviruses with short RNA electropherotypes. Serological responses to rotavirus vaccination appeared unaffected by the concurrent administration of oral polio vaccine. Lower types 1 and 3 polio antibody levels were found in children who received oral polio and rotavirus vaccines but the differences were not statistically significant.\r"

The extent of the changes varied, but all eleven children followed up for more than 6 months from transplantation showed some of the changes. Patients treated with prednisone and azathioprine did not show any changes, clearly implicating cyclosporin in their aetiology. This dysmorphic syndrome along with the well-known hirsutism induced by cyclosporin may increase the risk of non-compliance with this immunosuppressive therapy.\r"

It was produced using a human laryngeal SCC as immunogen and screened using frozen section human tissue. Monoclonal antibody 17.13.Cl.10 faintly stains the basal layer of normal squamous epithelium, does not stain normal organ tissue other than myoepithelial cells, and reacts with few non-SCC tumors. It, therefore, may be a useful adjunct to standard histopathologic criteria for the diagnosis of SCC. It may prove helpful in the investigation of tumor-associated antigens. Despite major technical and immunologic problems, monoclonal antibodies to functional tissue-specific tumor-associated antigens have the potential to play a major role in imaging and in treatment in the future.\r"

Connective tissue changes secondary to other forms of treatment were apparent bilaterally and changes limited to the site of collagen injection were identified. There have been reports of persistence of injected collagen in the canine larynx at 1 year but this is the only study documenting persistence in a human subject. The implant appeared homogeneous and was easily distinguished from host collagen and the reactive fibrosis associated with particulate Polytef. These findings are similar to those observed in the canine model and suggest that there is persistence of injected collagen in the human larynx.\r"

Thirty-four patients had disease that had been refractory to primary chemotherapy, and 66 patients had had a complete remission with primary chemotherapy but later relapsed. Before autologous bone marrow transplantation and high-dose chemotherapy, the 66 relapsed patients had also received conventional salvage chemotherapy; 22 had had no response or had had disease progression (a response termed \"resistant relapse\"), and 44 patients had responded partially or completely (a response termed \"sensitive relapse\"). After high-dose therapy and bone marrow transplantation, the actuarial three-year disease-free survival was zero in the refractory group, 14 percent in the resistant-relapse group, and 36 percent in the sensitive-relapse group. Patients who had had a complete remission in response to initial chemotherapy had a higher disease-free survival rate than those who had not (P less than 0.001), and patients with sensitive relapse had a higher disease-free survival rate than those with resistant relapse (P less than 0.003). These results should be considered in the planning or interpretation of trials of salvage chemotherapy in adults with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Despite advances in the primary treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, relapse is common and treatment after relapse is unsatisfactory. Autologous bone marrow transplantation, although sometimes successful, has generally had disappointing results. We conducted a trial of such transplantation in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, using strict criteria in selecting patients; we included only those in whom disease was minimal after conventional treatment (nodal disease less than 2 cm and bone marrow involvement less than or equal to 5 percent on histologic examination) and whose tumor cells expressed the B1 antigen. Forty-nine patients meeting these criteria received cyclophosphamide and whole-body irradiation supported by transplantation of autologous bone marrow that had been treated in vitro with anti-B1 monoclonal antibody and complement. All patients had features of a poor prognosis, including relapse from primary chemotherapy, histologic conversion to more aggressive disease, and extra-nodal dissemination. Thirty-three patients had a history of bone marrow involvement--16 at the time that marrow was obtained. Hematologic and immunologic engraftment was achieved in all patients. Only two treatment-related deaths occurred, from venoocclusive disease of the liver and intracerebral hemorrhage, respectively. Disease-free remission without maintenance therapy has lasted from greater than 2 to greater than 52 months in 34 patients (median follow-up, greater than 11 months). These results are similar to those obtained in patients with advanced, high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with primary combination chemotherapy. This study demonstrates that autologous bone marrow transplantation has tolerable toxicity and high efficacy in a subset of patients who are otherwise incurable but still responsive to cytoreductive therapy. The results suggest a role for such transplantation in the treatment of selected patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with allergic rhinitis often have immediate symptoms after antigen challenge (the early-phase response), followed several hours later by a recurrence of symptoms (the late-phase response). Systemic glucocorticosteroids are known to inhibit the late-phase but not the early-phase response. We studied the effect of one week of pretreatment with topical (rather than systemic) glucocorticosteroids on the response to nasal challenge with antigen in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of 13 allergic patients who had previously had a dual response to nasal challenge. The patients were challenged with three 10-fold increments of allergen, producing an early response, and were then followed for 11 hours, encompassing the late response, before they were rechallenged with the lowest dose of allergen. We monitored their responses by means of symptom scores and measurements of the levels of histamine, tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase activity, and kinins in nasal lavages. Topical glucocorticosteroids significantly reduced both the symptoms and the levels of histamine, TAME-esterase activity, and kinins in the early, late, and rechallenge allergic reactions. The fact that, in contrast to treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids, prolonged pretreatment with topical glucocorticosteroids inhibited the early-phase response to antigen suggests that the route and duration of administration affect the mechanisms of action of the steroids. We conclude that inhibition of the early-phase as well as the late-phase response by topical glucocorticosteroids may provide an advantage over treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids in patients with allergic rhinitis.\r"

I performed a prospective controlled trial of endoscopic multipolar electrocoagulation for active upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Patients were considered for entry if they had a bloody nasogastric aspirate, melena, or hematochezia, and any of the following: unstable vital signs, a requirement of greater than or equal to 2 units of blood per 12 hours, or a drop in hematocrit of greater than or equal to 6 percent in 12 hours. Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive multipolar electrocoagulation or sham multipolar electrocoagulation if endoscopy revealed active bleeding from an ulcer (24 patients), a Mallory-Weiss tear (17), or a vascular malformation (3). The group receiving multipolar electrocoagulation did significantly better in terms of hemostasis (90 percent vs. 13 percent, P less than 0.0001), mean (+/- SE) transfusion requirements (2.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.9 U; P = 0.002), mean number of hospital days (4.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.1, P = 0.02), and percentage needing emergency surgery or another intervention (14 vs. 57 percent, P = 0.01). Although mortality was lower in the group receiving multipolar electrocoagulation (0 vs. 13 percent), this difference was not statistically significant. The mean cost of hospitalization for treated patients was less than half that for the controls ($ 3,420 +/- 750 vs. $ 7,550 +/- 1,480, P = 0.001). I conclude that multipolar electrocoagulation markedly improves the hospital course in patients with major, nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\r"

Over 43 months, 174 patients with active bleeding (n = 32) or stigmata of recent bleeding (n = 142) due to peptic ulcers were randomly assigned during endoscopy to either standard treatment with laser photocoagulation or therapy without photocoagulation. There were no significant differences in a number of outcomes between the group treated with laser photocoagulation and the control group. Continued bleeding or rebleeding was observed in 22 percent of the laser-treated group and in 20 percent of the control group. Urgent surgery was necessary in 16 percent of the laser-treated patients and in 17 percent of the controls. Laser-treated patients spent a mean of 41 hours in the intensive care unit, and controls spent a mean of 32 hours. The mean hospital stay was 12 days in the laser-treated group and 11 days in the control group. One death occurred in each group. When patients with active bleeding were analyzed separately, there was no significant difference in outcome, even though laser photocoagulation stopped active bleeding in 88 percent of cases. Among patients with visible vessels, rebleeding occurred in 5 of 14 (36 percent) who received laser treatment and 2 of 15 (13 percent) who did not. Laser treatment precipitated bleeding in four patients and duodenal perforation in one. We conclude that Nd:YAG-laser photocoagulation does not benefit patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic ulcers.\r"

Tryptase, a neutral protease selectively concentrated in the secretory granules of human mast cells (but not basophils), is released by mast cells together with histamine and serves as a marker of mast-cell activation. In 17 patients with systemic mastocytosis, concentrations of tryptase in plasma were linearly related to those of histamine (P less than 0.01). Eleven of the 17 patients had tryptase levels of 4 to 88 ng per milliliter, indicating ongoing mast-cell activation. In each of six patients who experienced corresponding anaphylactic reactions after penicillin, aspirin, or melon ingestion, a wasp sting, exercise, or antilymphocyte globulin injection, tryptase levels in serum ranged from 9 to 75 ng per milliliter, indicating mast-cell activation during each of these events. In contrast, serum tryptase levels were less than 5 ng per milliliter in all patients presenting with myocardial disease (n = 8, 6 with hypotension) or sepsis (n = 6, 3 with hypotension) and in the controls (n = 20). One patient had a myocardial infarction after anaphylaxis in response to a wasp sting and an elevated tryptase level of 25 ng per milliliter. Thus, the plasma or serum tryptase level is a diagnostic correlate of mast-cell-related events.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid nodules are present in up to 50 percent of adults in the fifth decade of life. Patients are often treated with thyroxine in order to reduce the size of the nodule, but the efficacy of thyrotropin-suppressive therapy with thyroxine remains uncertain. In this study, 53 patients with a colloid solitary thyroid nodule confirmed by biopsy were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive placebo (n = 25) or levothyroxine (n = 28) for six months. Before treatment, pertechnetate-99m thyroid scanning showed that 22 percent of the nodules were functional, 25 percent hypofunctional, and 53 percent nonfunctional. High-resolution (10-MHz) sonography was used to measure the size of the nodules before and after treatment. Suppression of thyrotropin release was confirmed in the levothyroxine-treated group by the administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone; thyrotropin release was normal in the placebo group. Six months of therapy did not significantly decrease the diameter or volume of the nodules in the levothyroxine group as compared with the placebo group. We conclude that the efficacy of levothyroxine therapy in reducing the size of colloid thyroid nodules is not apparent within six months, despite effective suppression of thyrotropin.\r"

We and others have shown that the promastigote form of all species of leishmania activates complement from non-immune serum and that this activation can result in parasite lysis. This work, as well as earlier in vivo studies, suggested that complement is an important component of host defence against leishmaniasis. We now present evidence that parasite complement fixation, in addition to increasing parasite phagocytosis, is required for the intracellular survival of leishmania in macrophages. We specifically show a strong correlation between parasite C3 fixation and intracellular survival. We attribute this survival, in part, to a decrease in the magnitude of the macrophage respiratory burst which is triggered by complement-coated, as opposed to uncoated, parasites.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibitors of the conversion of angiotensinogen to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II have considerable value as antihypertensive agents. For example, captopril and enalapril are clinically useful as inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. This has encouraged intense activity in the development of inhibitors of kidney renin, which is a very specific aspartic proteinase catalysing the first and rate limiting step in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin II. The most effective inhibitors such as H-142 and L-363,564 have used non-hydrolysable analogues of the proposed transition state, and partial sequences of angiotensinogen (Table 1). H-142 is effective in lowering blood pressure in humans but has no significant effect on other aspartic proteinases such as pepsin in the human body (Table 1). At present there are no crystal structures available for human or mouse renins although three-dimensional models demonstrate close structural similarity to other spartic proteinases. We have therefore determined by X-ray analysis the three-dimensional structures of H-142 and L-363,564 complexed with the aspartic proteinase endothiapepsin, which binds these inhibitors with affinities not greatly different from those measured against human renin (Table 1). The structures of these complexes and of that between endothiapepsin and the general aspartic proteinase inhibitor, H-256 (Table 1) define the common hydrogen bonding schemes that allow subtle differences in side-chain orientations and in the positions of the transition state analogues with respect to the active-site aspartates.\r"

It has been suggested that the development of leukaemia in patients with MDS may be related to chromosomal abnormalities or genetic alterations: somatic mutation of the N-ras gene is now considered to be a critical step in the genetic basis of human leukaemogenesis. Here we report that DNAs of bone-marrow cells from three out of eight patients with MDS contained an activated N-ras oncogene, as detected by an in vivo selection assay in nude mice with transfected NIH 3T3 cells. Molecular analysis revealed the same single nucleotide substitution at codon 13 in all three transforming N-ras genes. Each of the three patients showed a progression of the disease and a resulting leukaemic change within the following year. Our observation of the mutation at codon 13 in leukaemic cell DNAs from all three cases suggests that activation of the N-ras gene is important in the development of leukaemia in some MDS cases.\r"

  ".W": "The enzyme-catalysed transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP is an important reaction in a wide variety of biological processes. We demonstrate here the essential function of an aspartate group in the catalysis of phosphoryl transfer by Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase, and the minor role of an arginine residue. We have used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to replace two amino-acid residues which X-ray analysis has shown to be close to the transferred phosphoryl group and we have analysed the forward and back reactions of the mutant enzymes by steady-state kinetics. Changing Asp 127 to Ser reduced the turnover number by a factor of 18,000 in the forward direction and 3,100 in the back reaction, and the Michaelis constant for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in the reverse reaction by a factor of 45. This shows that this aspartate is a key residue in the rate enhancement by the enzyme, probably acting as a base in the reaction mechanism, and that it also destabilizes the product complex. Changing Arg 171 to Ser reduced the turnover numbers by about 3.4, showing that this arginine has only a minor effect on the catalysis.\r"

Receptors for these amino acids can be classified into at least three types on the basis of their agonists. Quisqualate-preferring receptors and kainate-preferring receptors are implicated in the mediation of synaptic transmission in many regions including the hippocampus and visual cortex, whereas N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-preferring receptors are thought to be involved in modulating synaptic efficacy, for example in longterm potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In the visual cortex of the cat and monkey, it is well established that synaptic plasticity, estimated by susceptibility of binocular responsiveness of cortical neurons to monocular visual deprivation, disappears after the 'critical' period of postnatal development. Here we report that during the critical period in young kittens, a selective NMDA-receptor antagonist blocks visual responses of cortical neurons much more effectively than it does in the adult cat. This suggests that NMDA receptors may be involved in establishing synaptic plasticity in the kitten visual cortex.\r"

One-third of the syrinxes demonstrated by MRI were either not adequately visualized or missed by myelography and/or computed tomographic scanning. Intraoperative ultrasound has been used to allow more precise operative approaches to the syrinx as well as to guide the exact placement of shunt tubes into syrinx cavities. A method has also been developed to allow intraoperative ultrasound of the spinal cord with patients in the sitting position.\r"

Because creative authors and their papers influence the scholarship and technical course of a discipline such as neurosurgery, the number of citations to an author or publication is a good measure of creativity (the production of original ideas that are lasting and eminent). The 10 authors who had the largest number of citations of papers, chapters, and books were Penfield (3228), Cushing (2588), Dandy (1732), Bailey (1061), White (968), Matson (932), Ingraham (651), Scoville (604), Davidoff (540), and Elsberg (414). The most cited book was Epilepsy and the Functional Anatomy of the Human Brain, by Penfield and Jasper, and the most cited paper was Scoville and Milner's \"Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions.\" Authors who wrote more papers were found to have a greater total number of citations for these papers, but did not average more citations per paper than less productive colleagues. Neurosurgeons with research experience were more productive but not more creative than were more clinically oriented authors. The 5-year creative peak of 7 of the 10 most creative neurosurgeons occurred after the age of 50. The subjects on which the 50 neurosurgeons wrote the most papers were central nervous system tumors, trauma, and the basic neurosciences; these subjects also were cited most frequently. The proximity of the date of publication to the period of citation analysis resulted in a moderately better chance of a paper being cited, but more recent papers did not average more total citations.\r"

One patient with bizarre ambulatory spells probably representing absence status was recognized by Charcot as an epileptic. This otherwise healthy young man, without a history of generalized epilepsy or hysteria, experienced multiple spells during which he suddenly became unaware of his surroundings, rambled throughout Paris and its outskirts, and had complex interactions with other people. As Charcot unraveled the diagnostic mystery, he traced the patient's wanderings and analyzed the differential diagnosis, treatment, and pathophysiology of these intermittent spells.\r"

Annual mortality rates stabilized at 0.5 to 0.6 cases per million (1.1 to 1.2 cases per million in Paris). Six percent of cases were familial. Although the frequency of CJD was related to population density, no contacts could be established among the great majority of patients. No association with socioeconomic factors, preceding trauma or surgery (excepting one iatrogenic neurosurgical case), or exposure to animal sources of infection was identified. Evidence from this and other epidemiologic studies suggests that CJD is a minimally contagious disease that may be principally acquired in early life from presymptomatic patients, asymptomatic carriers, or chance contamination by environmental sources. It is possible that CJD could also occur sporadically as a noncontagious disease by a mechanism akin to oncogenes in carcinogenesis.\r"
