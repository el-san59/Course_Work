Erythromycin is important in this regard as illustrated in the following case of a 16-year-old girl who developed theophylline toxicity while on therapy with both of these drugs. As well as the potential for theophylline toxicity, coadministration of these two drugs may result in subtherapeutic serum erythromycin concentrations. Thus, if at all possible, this practice should be avoided. If unavoidable, then serial serum theophylline concentrations should be monitored. The occurrence of this interaction is unpredictable. Thus the previous recommendation of decreasing the theophylline dosage by 25% to prevent toxicity during erythromycin therapy is irrational and should be avoided. Drug interactions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of theophylline toxicity.\r"

In Arizona, the Department of Health Services (ADHS) regulates the provision of ambulance service through a \"certificate-of-necessity\" (CON) process. Paramedic rescue services provided by municipalities are not, by statute, mandated to comply with these ADHS regulations. We review the way in which criteria for the determination of ambulance need were adopted by this state agency and the effects of their application in Tucson, Arizona. Approximately one million dollars and 5,500 unnecessary \"code 3\" (lights and siren activated) emergency vehicle trips were mandated by the ADHS need criteria, over a twelve-month period. We conclude that non-scientifically-derived regulatory criteria may conflict with prudent medical control of prehospital emergency medical services (EMS).\r"

This benign ECG phenomenon is noted in 1% to 2% of the adult population and generally occurs in the absence of myocardial disease. The ECG manifestations may mimic acute myocardial injury or pericarditis. Exercise and isoproterenol tend to normalize the RST segment elevation. The presence of \"early repolarization\" does not preclude diagnosis of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia by treadmill testing, and coronary vaso-occlusive lesions may be demonstrated in some patients with the early repolarization pattern on ECG. The presence of S-T elevation in a patient with chest pain of possible cardiac origin mandates hospitalization and cardiac monitoring even if the ECG may confirm to a classic pattern of early repolarization; in this context, the diagnosis of benign early repolarization is one of exclusion. Recognition of this clinical entity and the use of previous ECGs for comparison would in most cases forestall the administration of thrombolytic agents to patients with S-T segment elevation due to benign early repolarization.\r"

Of 308 patients studied, 118 (38%) had definite or equivocal infiltrates and were considered to have pneumonia. No single symptom or sign was reliably predictive of pneumonia. Cough was the most common symptom in patients with pneumonia (86%), but was equally common in those with other respiratory illness. Fever was absent in 36 patients with pneumonia (31%). Abnormal findings on lung examination, that is, rales, rhonchi, decreased breath sounds, wheezes, altered fremitus, egophony, and percussion dullness, were each found in fewer than half of the patients with pneumonia. Twenty-six patients (22%) with a completely normal chest examination had pneumonia. Abnormal vital signs (temperature greater than 37.8 degrees C (100 degrees F), pulse greater than 100/min, or respirations greater than 20/min) were 97% sensitive for the detection of pneumonia. These criteria retained their sensitivity when films were subjected to a second, blinded interpretation by a senior radiologist. We conclude that restricting chest roentgenograms to patients with at least one abnormal vital sign will detect almost all radiographically demonstrable pneumonia in adult emergency department patients.\r"

Moreover a calculation of the hospital treatment capacity in the region could serve as a guideline for estimation of the dimensions needed for the medical rescue capacity and medical transport capacity when planning how to deal with a disaster.\r"

An Emergency Physicians Questionnaire was used for data collection. Data revealed that the three greatest sources of satisfaction include 1) proficient use of skills, 2) variety and excitement, and 3) being a member of an effective team. Major stresses reported by emergency physicians were 1) patient load, 2) interaction with patients and families, and 3) lack of administrative support. A longitudinal study should be initiated to follow a sample of emergency physicians from the time of their internship throughout their careers as a means of identifying factors that lead to a satisfying practice of emergency medicine.\r"

The mutant genes were transfected into L cells, and RNA from clones expressing these Ag was used for analysis by RNase and S1 nuclease mapping techniques. The first intervening sequence of both class I genes contains several potential 3' splice acceptor sites. However, a clear preference for only one site was detected in each of the H-2Dd and H-2Kd mRNA. Examination of the endogenous H-Dd and H-2Kd class I transcripts in normal murine tissues and in tumors demonstrated that the alternatively spliced mRNAs were produced, but at a low frequency. Infection of transfected L cells or tumor lines with vesicular stomatitis virus altered the level of differentially spliced message in these cells.\r"

However, very little is known about the therapeutic potential of anti-Id antibodies in animals and men. In this study we explored the combination of anti-Id and chemotherapy in a murine tumor system for which we had previously generated protective anti-Id mAb. First, we investigated various protocols by using a protective anti-Id in active immunization. Mice preimmunized before tumor transfer and challenged again after tumor survived significantly longer. Next, we explored the use of soluble anti-Id as immunostimulator in tumor-bearing mice. Although this treatment did not induce long-term survival, it significantly increased survival time. Interestingly, this anti-Id effect was dose dependent, whereby large and small doses had no effect. Finally, stimulatory anti-Id therapy and cyclophosphamide (Cy) treatment was combined. Tumor bearing mice were given a single dose of Cy followed by different doses of soluble anti-Id. The optimal effect on tumor growth and survival was achieved with 80 mg/kg Cy and 10 micrograms/mouse of anti-Id, where 80% of mice survived longer than 100 days. These results provide guidelines for developing clinical protocols for cancer patients by using combination therapy of anti-Id and chemotherapy.\r"

[Ca2+]i was significantly elevated in PBL and purified NK cells bound to NK-sensitive K562 and HSB2 target cells, but not in those bound to NK-resistant MD1 B-lymphoblastoid cells. Thus, a) the ability of a target cell to elicit a Ca2+ flux response correlated with its sensitivity to lysis of NK cells, and b) adhesion alone was not a sufficient stimulus for response induction. Conjugates of NK cells bound to K562 target cells were sorted onto agarose-coated slides on the basis of relative NK cell [Ca2+]i and evaluated in 19-hr single cell agarose cytotoxicity assays. In contrast to those with basal levels of [Ca2+]i, NK cells with elevated [Ca2+]i bound more strongly to target cells, as judged by the stability of conjugates to sort-related shear forces (p less than 0.01), and more frequently killed the target cell to which they were attached (p less than 0.05). Temporal fluctuations in [Ca2+]i were observed in target-bound NK cells in both the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Thus, influx of extracellular Ca2+ and release of Ca2+ from internal stores both appeared to contribute to the NK cell Ca2+ flux response triggered by adhesion to appropriate target cells. These results support the hypothesis that such fluctuations in NK cell [Ca2+]i constitute an early signal flagging the occurrence of NK cell recognition.\r"

  ".W": "After the anterior chamber (AC) injection of trinitrophenol-coupled (TNP) spleen cells, it is observed that systemic delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to TNP are inhibited by Ag-specific suppressor T cells. We recently reported that suppression is initiated by viable TNP-coupled T cells within the inoculum and upon further analysis we found that these cells have the surface phenotype of CD4+ Ts inducer cells. We report here that treatment of these TNP-T cells with cycloheximide or cytochalasin-B before to AC injection abolishes suppression, whereas treatment with 2000 rad radiation does not. This indicates that protein synthesis and secretion are required to initiate suppression but proliferation is not. Further, we demonstrate the adoptive transfer of suppression by serum of AC inoculated animals. Detection of the component in serum in adoptive transfer assays, however, requires removal of the spleen before AC injection. We establish that the material in serum is a Ts cell product (T suppressor-inducer factor) based on three criteria: it is Ag specific, genetically restricted, and reactive with a mAb that specifically identifies these molecules. These results suggest that the signal leaving the eye to induce suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity is T cell derived and that molecules mediating immune regulation for this organ are made within the eye and transported via the serum to the spleen.\r"

However, little information is yet available regarding similar effects in vivo. We have developed an approach whereby TGF beta 1 can be administered locoregionally to the bone marrow via direct injection into the femoral artery. Our studies show that intrafemoral administration of a single bolus dose of TGF beta 1 potently inhibits the baseline and IL-3-driven proliferation of bone marrow cells. This inhibition is relatively selective for the earlier multipotential granulocyte, erythroid, megakaryocyte, and macrophage CFU progenitor cells since these are completely inhibited while the more differentiated CFU assayed in culture colonies are inhibited by about 50%. The inhibition of hemopoietic progenitor growth and differentiation is both time and dose dependent with the maximal effect on the marrow observed at 24 h with doses greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/mouse, and the effect is reversed at later times. A possible practical implication of these in vivo results could be the use of TGF beta 1 to protect stem cells in the bone marrow from the myelotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs.\r"

  ".W": "The density of MHC class I was determined on a murine thymoma cell line (R1), an H-2 negative variant (R1E), and R1E-derived cell lines in which H-2 expression was restored by transfection of various MHC class I genes (Db, Kb, and truncated Db) and/or a beta-2-microglobulin gene (beta 2-m; B2). Appreciable MHC class I expression was found on R1 cells and on the variants in which MHC class I expression was restored by transfection of Db/beta 2-m or Kb/beta 2-m genes. Only approximately 20% difference was observed between the number of Db molecules and Kb molecules on the R1E/B2/Db and on R1E/B2/Kb, respectively. However, specific insulin binding was significantly different between these lines. By using a computer assisted curve fitting program, the insulin binding data for R1 and R1E/B2/Db cell lines best fitted a two-site model (K approximately 6 x 10(-9) M for high-affinity sites and a 2 to 3 x 10(-7) M for low-affinity sites), whereas all other lines only expressed one type of insulin binding site. These sites were unrelated to IGF-I and IGF-II receptors. Cross-linking of 125I-labeled insulin demonstrated specific binding of the ligand to a Mr approximately 130,000 dalton band in all lines. In the R1E/B2/Db cells, insulin also cross-linked to cell membrane molecules with Mr approximately 48,000 and approximately 60,000 Da, which were identified by immunoprecipitation to be the H chain of MHC class I and the heavy chain of MHC class I plus beta 2-m, respectively. It is concluded that the insulin receptors in the cell membrane interact specifically with D-products of MHC class I and that class I molecules of MHC may have a crucial role in insulin receptor expression. This may reflect a more general nonimmunologic role of MHC class I.\r"

  ".W": "Human eosinophil granules contain several basic proteins including eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and major basic protein (MBP). ECP and MBP are potent helminthotoxins while EDN is less so. Both ECP and EDN possess neurotoxic and ribonuclease activities. A clone representing ECP mRNA was isolated from an eosinophil lambda ZAP cDNA library. The cDNA sequence codes for a preprotein of 160 amino acids and a protein of 133 amino acids, the amino terminus of which is identical to the known partial amino acid sequence of ECP. The ECP nucleotide sequence shows similarity to EDN, rat pancreatic ribonuclease, and human angiogenin; all are members of the ribonuclease gene superfamily. Although the deduced amino acid sequence of ECP shares identical active site and substrate binding site residues with EDN, angiogenin, and human pancreatic ribonuclease, the ribonuclease activity of ECP is 50 to 100 times less than that of EDN possibly because of the lack of a positively charged residue at human pancreatic ribonuclease position 122. The calculated isoelectric point (10.8), electronic charge (14.5), and cationic charge distribution of ECP are different from those of EDN but similar to those of MBP, which may account in part for the greater helminthotoxic activity of ECP when compared to EDN. These data suggest that ECP and EDN are derived from a common ancestral ribonuclease gene and that ECP has evolved into a potent helminthotoxin similar in some respects to MBP, while losing much of its ribonuclease activity.\r"

  ".U": "89309774\r", 
  ".W": "Prosolin is a major cytosolic protein (Mr 18400, isoelectric point 5.9) first reported in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. It is rapidly phosphorylated (15 to 30 min) in response to TPA treatment as an early event in a sequence that leads to cessation of cell proliferation and to differentiation of promyelocytes into monocytes. In our study we examined the expression of prosolin in human peripheral lymphocytes and investigated the effects of TPA treatment on prosolin phosphorylation and on lymphocyte proliferation. Prosolin was not expressed in resting PBL but was induced after 24 to 36 h of PHA stimulation, simultaneously with induction of DNA synthesis. In rapidly proliferating (IL-2 dependent) PBL prosolin was a major cytosolic component, comprising 0.5% of total cytosolic protein, of which approximately 28% was phosphorylated. Expression of prosolin decreased again when either mitogen-induced or IL-2-dependent proliferation diminished during extended periods in culture. Thus, expression of prosolin is correlated with periods when PBL are cycling through S-phase. TPA treatment of IL-2-dependent PBL at the peak of their growth caused phosphorylation of about two-thirds of preexisting unphosphorylated prosolin within 1 h. This was accompanied by cessation of cell proliferation, as indicated by measurements of TdR incorporation. Although TPA has well known mitogenic effects in lymphocytes during initial activation, this result shows that it exerts an antiproliferative effect in rapidly dividing PBL. It is suggested that increased phosphorylation of prosolin may be an initiating event in the antiproliferative response to TPA, which would occur only in proliferating lymphocytes expressing prosolin.\r"

This resulted in the isolation of a 10 kDa polypeptide with ECEF activity. Purified material from 21 different preparations enhanced eosinophil killing of antibody-coated Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula by a mean of 206% (increase from 13.2 +/- 7.9% to 40.4 +/- 20.2% of targets killed, p less than 0.0001). Activity was maximal at a concentration of 20 ng ECEF polypeptide/ml and half-maximal between 0.8 and 4 ng/ml. Antibody specific for the 10 kDa polypeptide precipitated ECEF activity from a crude preparation and, by Western blot analysis, reacted only with a 10 kDa species in that preparation. The following N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined for the purified polypeptide: Val-Lys-Gln-Ile-Glu-Ser-Lys-Thr-Ala-Phe-Gln-Lys-Ala-Leu- -Ala- Gly- -Lys-Leu....Computer search showed that this sequence is unrelated to other known protein sequences. Thus, the ECEF polypeptide is a newly defined monokine, with the ability to enhance eosinophil cytotoxic function in vitro. This monokine may be an important regulator of eosinophil function in inflammation in vivo.\r"

These mAb, which included one IgM and two IgG3, were studied in primary cultures of rodent hepatocytes inoculated with sporozoites of P. yoelii. These results confirm previous reports of the extended action of antibodies on Plasmodium falciparum after entering hepatocytes by producing a strong intrahepatocyte inhibitory effect in addition to the inhibitory effect on sporozoite entry. As with P. falciparum the intracellular effects on P. yoelii liver stages are only observed when the antibodies are present at the time the sporozoite enters the cell. While carrying out experiments on this phenomenon, it was discovered that, at lowered antibody concentrations, an increase in number of maturing liver schizonts occurs, with the increase or enhancement of infection reaching up to 150% of that of controls. It was also observed that there was an inverse relationship between the antibody concentration that was inhibitory and that which enhanced parasite infectivity.\r"

By an indirect ELISA technique, we selected 56 plasma samples with high anti-hTg antibody activity and used the IgG fraction isolated from these plasma to study the antigenic domains on the hTg molecule recognized by the natural anti-hTg aAb. A panel of 15 mAb, coupled to alkaline phosphatase and recognizing six regions (I to VI) on the hTg molecule, served to identify the domains recognized by the natural anti-hTg aAb using a competitive ELISA procedure. A total of 26 of the IgG fractions was found to interact with at least one of the regions defined by our battery of mAb. Region V was recognized by the majority of the IgG fractions. Interestingly, region II was rarely recognized by the same IgG fraction that reacted with region V. Inasmuch as we have previously shown that region II is mainly recognized by aAb in the serum of subjects with various thyroid disorders, we propose that recognition of region V reflects the normal physiologic state of the immune system with respect to the hTg molecule.\r"

C3F occurs at appreciable frequencies only in Caucasian populations and has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of certain diseases, such as partial lipodystrophy, IgA nephropathy, and Indian childhood cirrhosis. It has been shown that C3F differs from C3S with regard to isoelectric point as well as its ability to bind macrophages. The availability of a full-length cDNA probe for human C3 has made it possible to study the polymorphism at the genomic level. We have used RNA/RNA hybridization to demonstrate that the difference between C3F and C3S occurs in the C3d region. We subsequently used oligonucleotide-primed DNA amplification to show that C3F arises from a point mutation at codon 1216 converting a deoxyadenosine for a deoxyguanosine. The result of this point mutation at the translational level is the substitution of an asparagine residue in C3S for an aspartic acid residue in C3F. It is known that C3d contains the binding site for CR2 as well as the internal thioester site and multiple protease cleavage sites. The identification of the structural basis of the differences between C3F and C3S will assist our continuing studies of the mechanism of the functional differences between the two alleles and the disease associations of C3F. It also allows us to use DNA based techniques to allotype C3 in subjects with little or no C3 in their serum.\r"

All conjugates induced stronger antidextran antibody responses than the polysaccharide, and a fair proportion of these antibodies were IgG. However, there was a range of antigenicities. Consistently strong responses were obtained with conjugates that carried small dextran molecules (m.w. 1000 to 4000) coupled to the protein via the reducing end. Modification of such an \"optimal\" conjugate either by increasing the size of the saccharide to 40,000 Da, or by permitting multiple attachments of the saccharide molecule to the protein, reduced its antigenicity. Carbohydrate/protein ratios varying from 0.17 to 0.49 were associated with excellent antidextran responses.\r"

K/NK lymphocyte Fc gamma RIII, which plays a role in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, is an efficient signal transducing molecule, whereas neutrophil Fc gamma RIII, which plays a role in immune-complex clearance, seems less efficient in signal transduction. Neutrophil Fc gamma RIII has been reported to be a glycan-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein. Our studies suggest that K/NK lymphocyte Fc gamma RIII is protein-anchored rather than glycan-phosphatidylinositol-anchored. That is, K/NK lymphocyte Fc gamma RIII was resistant to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and surface expression of Fc gamma RIII was not affected on K/NK lymphocytes from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a disorder of hemopoietic stem cells resulting in deficient expression of glycan-phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Different membrane anchoring mechanisms of the Fc gamma RIII may account for different consequences of the ligand binding to two cell types.\r"

A ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), for at least one member of the CD18 complex has been identified. This molecule is inducible on many cell types including vascular endothelium and keratinocytes by inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, TNF, and IFN-gamma. ICAM-1 has been shown to mediate, in part, the in vitro adhesion of lymphocytes and neutrophils to endothelial cells expressing ICAM-1. In the present study we have shown that mAb's to the human CD18 complex and to human ICAM-1 cross react with rabbit cells and that both anti-CD18 and anti-CD11b but neither anti-CD11a nor anti-ICAM-1 mAb's inhibit neutrophil migration, an adhesion-dependent function, in vitro. Pretreatment of rabbits with anti-CD18 and anti-ICAM-1 but not anti-CD11a mAb inhibited by greater than 60% neutrophil migration into PMA-induced inflamed rabbit lungs. This effect of anti-ICAM-1 mAb on pulmonary neutrophil influx after PMA injection has important implications. Specifically, that ICAM-1 can function as a ligand for CD18 and can mediate, at least in part, the migration of neutrophils to inflammatory sites.\r"

Oxidant stress, in the form of alloxan or divicine, also enhanced serum levels of TNF in mice made sensitive to LPS by low-level infection with malaria, and then given i.v. LPS. Pretreatment with the iron chelator, desferal, or the free radical scavenger, BHA, inhibited TNF release in these animals. Less TNF was also detected in mice given desferal before LPS in the absence of exogenous radical generator.

The uptake of antibody during feeding leads to severe damage to the parasite. One of the responsible tick gut Ag has now been purified and characterized: the Bm86 Ag. It is a membrane-bound glycoprotein present in very low abundance in extracts of partially engorged adult female ticks. It has an apparent m.w. of 89,000, an isoelectric point of 5.1 to 5.6 and an affinity for wheat germ lectin. Microgram amounts of this Ag are able to induce effective protection in cattle against the parasite, as shown by the decreased survival of ticks on vaccinated cattle and a reduction in engorgement weights and egg laying capacity of the survivors. Antisera to the Ag react with the surface of digest cells in the tick gut. As a result of the reaction with antibody, the endocytotic activity of these cells, which is a critical step in bloodmeal digestion in this tick, is strongly and rapidly inhibited. A number of peptides from this Ag, produced by digestion of the reduced and alkylated protein with endoproteinase lys-C, have been sequenced. One peptide has significant amino acid sequence homology with the epidermal growth factor precursor and a second peptide has homology with a putative protective antigen from Plasmodium falciparum.\r"

We present the cDNA and genomic sequences of two rabbit defensins, macrophage cationic peptides MCP-1 and MCP-2. Their cDNA and genomic sequences are highly homologous, reflecting the homology between the two defensins (32 of 33 amino acids). The MCP genes are closely linked (within 13 kb) suggesting that they evolved by a recent tandem gene duplication. Their cDNA sequences indicate that the peptides are synthesized as 95 amino acid prepro-MCPs, consistent with their lysosomal location. The MCP genes are separated into three exons encoding distinct domains: the 5' untranslated region, the prepropeptide domain, and the mature defensin sequence. Fully developed polymorphonuclear leukocytes, short-lived phagocytes with limited capacity for protein and nucleic acid synthesis, contained MCPs but lacked MCP mRNA. MCP mRNA was found in bone marrow and spleen, organs which contained immature polymorphonuclear leukocytes. MCP and MCP mRNA were detected in lung macrophages, but not in macrophages from other organs, nor in monocytes, the putative macrophage precursors. In macrophages, the expression of MCPs appears to be a marker of lung-specific differentiation.\r"

  ".U": "89309861\r", 
  ".W": "This study examines the action of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on the synthesis of cholesterol sulfate in cultured normal and transformed human epidermal keratinocytes and assesses the antagonistic effects by retinoids and bryostatins on PMA action in relation to the multistep program of squamous differentiation. Treatment of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) with PMA induces terminal cell division (irreversible growth-arrest) and causes a time- and dose-dependent increase in the incorporation of Na2(35)SO4 into cholesterol sulfate, a marker for squamous cell differentiation. This stimulation in sulfate incorporation appears specific for cholesterol sulfate and is due to increased levels of cholesterol sulfotransferase activity. The increase in cholesterol sulfate accumulation parallels the increase in transglutaminase type I, another marker for squamous differentiation. Several transformed NHEK cell lines do not exhibit increased levels of cholesterol sulfate and transglutaminase type I activity after PMA treatment, indicating that they acquired defects in the regulation of squamous differentiation. Bryostatins 1 and 2, and several diacylglycerol analogues neither inhibit cell proliferation nor increase cholesterol sulfate synthesis or transglutaminase activity, indicating that these agents do not induce terminal differentiation. In contrast, the bryostatins block the increase in cholesterol sulfate and transglutaminase activity as well as the commitment to terminal cell division by PMA. Bryostatin 1 inhibits the commitment to terminal cell division and the accumulation of cholesterol sulfate significantly even when added 8 h after PMA administration. Retinoids inhibit cholesterol sulfate accumulation and the increase in transglutaminase activity by PMA but do not affect the commitment to terminal cell division. In summary, phorbol esters induce in NHEK cells a program of squamous differentiation. This process of differentiation consists of the commitment to terminal cell division and expression of a squamous phenotype. Expression of this phenotype is accompanied by an accumulation of cholesterol sulfate and increased cholesterol sulfotransferase activity. Bryostatins 1 and 2 and retinoic acid affect this differentiation process at different stages.\r"

Northern transfer analysis with poly(A)+RNA revealed the presence of specific mRNA transcripts for alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains of type IV procollagen as well as B1 and B2 chains of laminin. Laminin A chain mRNAs were not detected using the same RNA preparations. Quantitative estimates of the steady-state levels of type IV procollagen and laminin mRNAs indicated that they were of relatively low abundance, as compared with mRNA to type I procollagen. The expression of alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) collagen genes was high in fetal fibroblasts but was reduced to low, yet detectable, levels in cultures established from 3-d to 61-year-old individuals. In contrast, the laminin B1 and B2 chain mRNA levels showed little age-associated variation within the cultures examined. These results provide evidence for differential regulation of the expression of different basement membrane zone macromolecules during chronologic aging.\r"

  ".W": "The distributions of xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) and xanthine oxidase (XO) in subpopulations of murine keratinocytes differing in their stages of terminal differentiation were determined by enzymatic analyses. Keratinocytes were isolated from the skins of female SENCAR mice that had been treated 72 h earlier with either acetone or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The ratio of XO/(XD + XO) specific activities was used as an index of the XD to XO conversion. The XO/(XD + XO) ratios for basal cell, suprabasal cell, granular cell plus squamae, and horny sheet preparations isolated from acetone- or TPA-treated mice were 0.35, 0.35, 0.45, 0.75 and 0.28, 0.29, 0.58, and 1.0, respectively. Total XD + XO and XO specific activities in each subpopulation derived from TPA-treated mice were approximately twice the values measured in their control counterparts. Suspension culturing of basal cell keratinocytes in methylcellulose induced terminal differentiation and a conversion of XD to XO. The kinetics of keratin disulfide crosslinking and the XD to XO conversion were similar and preceded cornification. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the conversion of XD to XO occurs primarily during the later stages of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Furthermore, the increases in XO activity measured in epidermal homogenates after TPA treatment are due to TPA-dependent increases in 1) the relative proportions of keratinocytes undergoing differentiation, 2) tissue XD content, and 3) increased conversion of XD to XO.\r"

  ".W": "Cutis laxa is a genetically heterogeneous connective tissue disease that occurs in both inherited and acquired forms. The most apparent defect is loose, redundant, nonresilient skin, but systemic connective tissue abnormalities exist, especially in conjunction with the early onset or autosomal recessive variety. The elastic fiber shows morphologic alterations. We studied dermal skin biopsies and cultured skin fibroblasts from 6 patients with congenital forms of cutis laxa in an effort to correlate alterations in elastin morphology and metabolism. In general, ultrastructural analysis revealed occasional variance in collagen fiber diameter, whereas elastic tissue varied in content, appearance, and the proportion and manner by which elastin and microfibrillar component associated. Fibroblast cell lines comprised of normal donors from a similar age group produced an average of 35 +/- 10 X 10(3) tropoelastin molecular equivalents per cell per hour, as measured by an ELISA. Three of six cutis laxa cell strains were markedly (5-20-fold) reduced in tropoelastin production. Two of these cell strains had specifically reduced levels of tropoelastin production relative to total protein synthesis. Analysis of elastin specific messenger RNA levels indicated this reduced expression of tropoelastin was regulated at a pretranslational level. In other strains, diminished production of elastin did not appear to be the primary defect, underscoring the heterogeneous nature of cutis laxa at both the biochemical and ultrastructural levels.\r"

A decrease in the bound water content was observed when the stratum corneum was extracted using water, a mixed solvent of chloroform:methanol (2:1), or a 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) aqueous solution. However, extraction using a mixed solvent of acetone:ether (1:1) did not change the bound water content at temperatures above -20 degrees C. The lipids extracted by acetone:ether-extraction method consisted of sebaceous gland lipids, cholesterol, free fatty acids, and ceramides. In contrast, the lipids extracted by chloroform:methanol-extraction method contained more polar lipids such as sphingomyelin, which had the same amount of bound water in itself as that of the water-extracted stratum corneum. These results suggest that the polar lipids soluble in the chloroform and methanol mixture may contribute to enhance the bound water content. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the water-holding capacity of the stratum corneum is dependent on both the hygroscopic components such as the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) and the polar lipids, such as sphingolipids, existing in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum.\r"

To evaluate the regulation of the differentiation of epidermal cells by these agents, we have employed delipidized serum from which glucocorticoids and retinoids were removed. Thirty percent of SqCC/Y1 cells spontaneously expressed the terminally differentiated phenotype after 6 d in culture, as measured by the capacity to form detergent-insoluble cornified envelopes. Exposure of SqCC/Y1 cells to hydrocortisone at concentrations of 30, 100 and 300 nM produced a 25, 100, and 175%, increase, respectively, in the number of differentiated cells over untreated control cultures. Exposure of cells to retinoic acid at levels of from 3 to 300 nM caused a 24 to 85% decrease in the quantity of differentiated cells. Simultaneous treatment of SqCC/Y1 cells with hydrocortisone and retinoic acid resulted in mutual antagonism of cornified envelope formation. Treatment of SqCC/Y1 cells with a 1000-fold molar excess of retinoic acid did not directly alter the uptake of hydrocortisone, and a 100-fold molar excess did not directly inhibit the binding of the corticosteroid to its receptor. Pretreatment of cells for 48, 72, or 96 h with 100 nM retinoic acid decreased the binding of hydrocortisone to its receptor by only 20%, and only resulted in a small decrease in the total amount of hydrocortisone associated with cells 48 h after the addition of retinoic acid. These findings suggest that the antagonism between hydrocortisone and retinoic acid on the terminal differentiation of SqCC/Y1 is not expressed at the level of the corticosteroid receptor.\r"

In the present study, electron microscopy revealed that the heated or solvent-extracted tissue was characterized by cell-to-cell contacts that appeared to involve the chemically bound hydroxyceramides which constitute the corneocyte lipid envelope. It is proposed that the irreversible bonding between corneocytes that results from heating or lipid extraction results from interdigitation of the sphingosine chains belonging to those hydroxyceramides that are bound to the corneocyte protein envelope by the omega-hydroxyl function of the 30- and 32-carbon hydroxyacid moieties. Similar interdigitation of adjacent envelopes might be involved in natural stratum corneum cohesion, limited mostly to the periphery of corneocytes where the absence of intercellular lamellae allows the appropriate cell-to-cell contact.\r"

Recently, nontoxic synthesized low molecular weight proteinase inhibitors have been clinically available for the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation and pancreatitis. To determine if these drugs are useful aids to treat patients with pemphigus, we examined the effect of omega-guanidino ester analogues, i.e., 1) gabexate mesilate, 2) camostat mesilate, and 3) nafamostat mesilate, on experimental pemphigus acantholysis in both organ culture and neonatal BALB/c mice. Furthermore, the effect of plasma natural proteinase inhibitors (alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor) isolated from human plasma was similarly examined. Results revealed that synthesized low molecular weight inhibitors (drugs) were able to inhibit the induction of acantholysis in organ culture system, but had little or no effect on lesion formation in the neonatal mouse system. By contrast, alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor could completely inhibit acantholysis formation in mice. These findings implied a possible new therapeutic approach using proteinase inhibitors for patients with pemphigus.\r"

In the present study, the proliferative activity, as defined by Ki 67 monoclonal antibody (reactive with all actively cycling cells), has been determined by immunohistologic and morphometric methods in cutaneous melanocytic tumors. Quantitative morphologic features of Ki 67-positive and Ki 67-negative nuclei were separately assessed using computer-assisted image analysis. Comparing morphometric features and proliferative activity, the most significant correlation was found between mean nuclear volume and the percentage of Ki 67-positive nuclei in each lesion (linear regression analysis: r = 0.73; p = less than 0.05). On multidimensional discriminant analysis, tumors with high proliferative activity (more than 5 X 10(3) Ki 67-positive cells per mm3 tumor tissue) were detected at a specificity of 92% and a sensitivity of 75%. Within one lesion, Ki 67-positive nuclei showed an increase in nuclear volume (Wilcoxon test: p = less than 0.05), a more spheroid shape (p = less than 0.05), and a wider dispersion of nuclear volume values (Siegel-Tukey test: p = less than 0.05) than negative nuclei. Discriminant analysis on the basis of nuclear volume density functions facilitated an estimation of the proliferative state (resting or cycling) of a given nucleus. The results are consistent with increased cellular synthetic activity in highly proliferating lesions and particularly in actively cycling cells. The association of proliferative activity and quantitative nuclear features may be helpful in the interpretation of morphometric studies concerning melanocytic skin tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of skin to nanosecond-domain laser pulses affects the pigmentary system by a process called selective photothermolysis, in which melanosomes and pigmented cells are preferentially altered. Due to the broad absorption spectrum of melanin, this effect may occur with wavelengths that penetrate to vastly different depths within tissue, potentially producing different biologic responses. The effects of single near-ultraviolet (355 nm), visible (532 nm), and near infrared (1064 nm) pulses of 10-12 nsec duration were determined in guinea pig skin using gross, histologic, and electron microscopic observations. Threshold response in pigmented skin was a transient immediate ash-white discoloration, requiring 0.11, 0.20, and 1.0 J/cm2, at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, respectively. At each wavelength, melanosomes were ruptured within keratinocytes and melanocytes, with cytoplasmic and nuclear alterations. Delayed epidermal depigmentation occurred, followed by gradual repigmentation. Deep follicular cells were altered only at 532 and 1064 nm, which produced permanent leukotrichia. The action spectrum for threshold response was consistent with mechanisms implied by selective photothermolysis. These data may be useful for consideration of treatment for cutaneous pigmentation abnormalities or unwanted follicular pigmentation, or both.\r"

In normal skin, the protein was localized to the dermoepidermal junction zone below the basement membrane and was extractable from the papillary dermis after artificial epidermolysis. In SGRDEB skin, neither immunoreactive material below the basement membrane nor identifiable anchoring fibrils could be recognized and neither the tissue form nor the specific proteolytic fragments of type VII collagen were found in extracts of SGRDEB skin. Very low amounts of type VII collagen alpha-chains could be detected in cultures of SGRDEB-fibroblasts, whereas normal fibroblasts synthesized more of this collagen. These results suggest that a genetic defect in the correct synthesis, secretion, or in the molecular assembly of type VII collagen may underlie SGRDEB.\r"

To further characterize the induction response, in this study we have utilized highly specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) 1-7-1, 2-66-3, and 1-98-1 directed against highly purified rat liver P-450s induced by 3-methyl-cholanthrene, phenobarbital and ethanol, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of hepatic microsomes prepared from CCT-treated animals showed a significant increase in the coomassie blue stainable proteins in the P-450 region; however, this was not evident in epidermal microsomes. Immunoblot analysis of epidermal and hepatic microsomes with MoAb 1-7-1 revealed strong immunoprecipitin bands in both tissues. MoAb 2-66-3 showed significant immunoreactivity only with hepatic microsomes. Interestingly, CCT treatment resulted in suppression of immunoreactivity with MoAb 1-98-1 in hepatic microsomes. MoAb 1-7-1 and 2-66-3 exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effects in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activities induced by CCT application. MoAb 1-7-1 was substantially more effective in this respect. Epidermal and hepatic microsomes prepared from CCT-treated rats showed significantly greater metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene (BP). MoAb 1-7-1 and MoAb 2-66-3 inhibited BP metabolism in both the tissues. However, MoAb 1-7-1 was more inhibitory in this regard as compared to MoAb 2-66-3. These studies indicate that topical application of therapeutic CCT to the skin of neonatal rats results in induction of P-450 isozyme c in epidermis and isozymes b and c in liver, and that this induction is associated with the suppression of P-450 isozyme j in liver.\r"

The dose- and time-dependency of the drug effects on DNA synthesis was examined by 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA and by autoradiography. Electron microscopy was used to detect the target cell organelles of the drug. Azelaic acid decreased DNA synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 20 mM. The inhibition of DNA synthesis was already observed after 1 h of treatment, reached its maximum after 4 h, and was stable for 24 h. A complete reversibility of the inhibitory effects was observed within 2 h after discontinuation of the treatment, and, interestingly, a rebound effect occurred with a temporary increase of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, treatment with AZA reduced the RNA and protein synthesis of the cells. Electron microscopic evaluation of treated cultures showed early marked damage of the mitochondria, followed by dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). These alterations were completely reversible after discontinuation of the treatment. Our findings show that AZA exerts a dose- and time-dependent, reversible antiproliferative effect on keratinocytes, acting primarily on mitochondria and RER. The antiproliferative action of AZA could explain its beneficial effect in some skin disorders characterized by alteration of keratinocytic differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The permeability barrier of hairless mouse skin has been determined in vitro after exposure of the epidermal surface to volumes of acetone typically used in human in vivo skin penetration studies. It has been shown that the transport of tritiated water (when applied for limited 5-h periods) across hairless mouse skin is not affected by acetone treatments of approximately 15 microliters/cm2. Submersion of the membranes between aqueous donor and receptor phases for periods greater than 24 h, however, leads to significant and catastrophic barrier impairment. The acetone dose in the experiments reported is greater than that employed in vivo when the solvent is used to deposit a penetrant on human skin. We suggest, therefore, that acetone-mediated facilitation of percutaneous absorption in humans is unlikely. A further conclusion of this work is that in vitro solvent-deposition penetration experiments using hairless mouse skin should provide reliable transport information for at least 48 h postadministration. Although hairless mouse skin is more permeable than its human counterpart, in vitro measurements using the murine barrier should, therefore, provide useful and relevant guidelines for risk assessment calculations and bioavailability determinations.\r"

  ".W": "Cultures of HUT 102 lymphoblasts, comprised of near-diploid and hyperdiploid cells (11 and 22 pg of DNA/nucleus), were irradiated for 2 h by long wave ultraviolet light (UV-A) (2.1 mW/cm2), reacted for the same time in the dark with suprapharmacologic concentrations of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) (15 micrograms/ml) and exposed to 8-MOP and UV-A (PUVA) under identical conditions. Flow cytometric determinations of cellular DNA content and IdUrd incorporation indicated that UV-A irradiated cells incorporated IdUrd at the control levels and that the number of cells in S and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle likewise were identical to controls. The dark reaction of HUT 102 cells with 8-MOP has, however, resulted in a transient increase of IdUrd incorporation, but it has not affected cellular proliferation rates. On the other hand, no IdUrd incorporation was detected after PUVA. The analysis of the DNA content of intact and PUVA-exposed cultures showed that the number of near-diploid S-phase cells was greater 24 h after PUVA, whereas the number of hyperdiploid cells in all phases of the cell cycle had decreased. Under stated conditions the viability of HUT 102 cells and their cell cycle disturbances by PUVA are determined in part by the amount of DNA in target lymphoblasts.\r"

This has led to speculations that hyperoestrogenaemia might be a coronary risk factor. It is not clear why plasma levels of oestrogens should be elevated in coronary heart disease. To ascertain whether hyperoestrogenaemia might be present before the onset of a myocardial infarction, we performed a prospective study in 252 men above the age of forty who within the following 5 years suffered an AMI and, as controls, 526 men matched for age and coronary risk factors and 329 randomly selected men. Mean plasma concentrations of oestradiol and oestrone did not differ significantly between the groups. This suggests that hyperoestrogenaemia is not a coronary risk factor and thus, if present after the AMI, is more likely develop concurrently with the myocardial infarction.\r"

The procedure-combined mortality was 3.9% (13 out of 331 patients). The mortality was 2-3% during the first 3 years, 4-6% from the fourth to the seventh year, and 9-10% per year thereafter. Late deaths (n = 101) were caused by coronary heart disease (CHD) in 51% by cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in 17% and by other causes in 32% of the cases. The ratio of CHD to CVD deaths, 3:1, is similar to a normal population. The possibility of dying in a cerebrovascular accident is six-fold in untreated patients when compared to the results in this study. The combined incidence of fatal and non-fatal strokes during the first and fifth year was 3%, and otherwise 1-2%. The other manifestations of atherosclerosis, CHD, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease were combined with CVD in 68.5% of the cases. The frequency of CHD was significantly combined with elevated serum triglyceride, and apolipoprotein B concentrations, decreased serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations at the control examination, and frequency of hypertension. Therefore, it would be important to follow such patients and reduce the risk factors of CHD.\r"

With TX pacing the heart rate was 56% and the exercise tolerance 15% higher than with fixed-rate ventricular-inhibited (VVI) pacing during exercise. Holter ECG monitoring showed a physiological rate variability. Six patients (16%) have died during follow-up, and programming to the VVI mode was necessary in six patients (16%). The remaining patients were alive with a subjectively adequate TX function at the end of follow-up. Including the five patients who were on TX pacing at the time of death, satisfactory TX pacing was obtained in 84% of the patients. Although the TX pacemaker has been reliable and provides an adequate rate response during exercise, complaints of worsening angina pectoris and the somewhat complicated programming of the device are problems with the current models.\r"

In agreement with our previous findings, patients with pruritus had significantly (P less than 0.01) higher serum levels of PTH fragment 53-68 (m-PTH53-68) than patients without pruritus, 47.7 +/- 40.0 and 23.4 +/- 17.1 micrograms l-1 respectively. Serum concentrations of other substances including calcium, phosphate and magnesium did not differ between the two groups of patients. Intradermal injections of human PTH1-34 and PTH44-68 failed to evoke any acute or delayed cutaneous reactions in either patients or controls. Immunohistochemical investigations of skin biopsies from uraemic patients using several different antibodies against PTH were negative.

The hierarchical model consists of five modes of psychological and psychobiological functioning defined epigenetically. Research and theories of opiate addiction are classified as to their primary modal emphases. We then describe failures of self-regulation as particular vulnerabilities along the first three modes of the hierarchy. A measure of this construct, the Scale for Failures in Self-Regulation (SFSR), a projective measure that utilizes Thematic Apperception Test responses, is introduced for the study of opiate addicts. The SFSR was administered to normal and opiate-addicted subjects in order to examine the predictive and explanatory power of the hierarchial model. A multivariate analysis of variance showed the addicts to have greater difficulties in self-regulatory functioning than normal subjects. In terms of the hierarchical model, the implications of these findings for the questions of severity of illness, psychotherapy technique, and future research are discussed.\r"

The number of individuals in the sample qualifying for a lifetime diagnosis of an alcohol abuse-related disorder was quite high (47%), and there was a strong correlation between disorders of alcohol abuse and the use of other drugs. Other than alcohol, marijuana was the most frequently abused drug. Individuals who qualified for a diagnosis of an alcohol-related disorder were compared with those who did not on a variety of diagnostic and demographic variables. The authors conclude by suggesting that the high-risk rates of drug use-related disorders reported in this sample may be due to the preferential use of emergency services by schizophrenic patients with alcohol and drug abuse-related disorders.\r"

The substantia nigra was also studied in 14 cases of Down's syndrome, 13 of which had cortical Alzheimer pathology. Twelve (7.8%) of the controls aged over 60 years showed nigral Lewy bodies. There was mild nerve cell degeneration and/or an extranigral distribution of Lewy bodies, suggestive of presymptomatic Parkinson's disease. Twenty five (22.5%) of the Alzheimer's disease cases over 60 years showed Lewy bodies, but only 14 (14.0%) of these had mild nigral cell loss consistent with presymptomatic Parkinson's disease. No case of Down's syndrome had Lewy bodies. Counts of tangles and plaques in hippocampus, frontal and temporal cortex were lower in cases of Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies compared with those without, but cortical choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities were similar. This suggests that Lewy body degeneration in the nucleus basalis of Meynert contributes to the deficit of cortical ChAT, but not to the cortical Alzheimer pathology. The relatively small difference in the prevalence of Lewy bodies between controls and Alzheimer's disease could be explained by the additive effects of Lewy body and tangle pathology causing dementia, rather than a greater than chance association between Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.\r"

The range and frequency of clinical features contrast strikingly with previous reports. The majority of cases presented with classical levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease either alone (6 cases) or with mild cognitive impairment (3 cases); the remaining 6 cases presented with cognitive impairment alone. In time almost all patients developed both dementia and Parkinsonism. The dementia was cortical in type, but unusual in that most (12 cases) showed day-to-day fluctuation in severity at some point in their illness. These findings suggest that diffuse Lewy body disease is not rare, and that it presents in a range of ways from dementia with subsequent Parkinsonism to Parkinson's disease with subsequent dementia. The latter mode of presentation suggests that it should be considered as a significant pathological substrate of dementia in Parkinson's disease.\r"

At the lowest dose administered (0.25 mg tid), nine of the 10 patients improved with respect to rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor. At this dose there was one dropout because of severe orthostasis. Although there was a trend towards improvement in motor scores with the higher doses (0.5-1.0 mg tid), this was not statistically significant. At higher doses there were a total of four dropouts because of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension.

In contrast, offspring and patients with symptomatic chorea had preserved LLR which did not differ in amplitude or duration from normal controls. Additionally, the mean amplitude and mean duration of the Hoffmaan-reflex (HR) was found to be increased in patients with HD and their offspring but not in patients with other aetiologies. It is concluded (1) that the loss of LLR is not related to the choreatic hyperkinesia itself but to the degeneration of a hitherto poorly defined neuronal circuit in HD; (2) that among a variety of diseases presenting with chorea, the loss of LLR seems to be specific for HD; (3) that the testing of hand muscle reflexes in choreatic movement disorders is helpful for the differential diagnosis of early HD but not for the detection of gene carriers among offspring of patients with HD.\r"

The problem of the short available nerve segment of the intercostal nerves and the bizzare compound motor action potential (CMAP) of inconsistent latency while recording over the intercostal muscles, is overcome by applying recording electrodes over the rectus abdominis muscle and stimulating the nerves at two points at a fair distance away. With the use of multiple recording sites over the rectus abdominis, the motor points for different intercostal nerves were delineated. CMAP of reproducible latencies and waveforms with sharp take-off points were obtained. Conduction velocity of the intercostal nerves could be determined.\r"

The compound muscle action potentials were recorded bilaterally by surface electrodes applied to the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles. The latencies to the affected muscles were significantly prolonged. The appropriate root dysfunction was confirmed at operation or by the imaging techniques. It was concluded that surface stimulation of the lumbosacral roots by a magnetic coil is a potentially useful technique for the non-invasive evaluation of the function of the lumbosacral roots.\r"

After a mean period of follow-up of 22 years (range 18-26), only mild residual physical disabilities exist in each patient. These three cases illustrate (1) the need promptly to investigate children who present with focal seizures or whose EEG shows definite focal abnormalities, (2) the relevant investigations should include cranial CT or MRI in such cases and (3) that certain supratentorial tumours have a favourable outcome due to their benign biological behaviour rather than their location.\r"

Only 33% of patients had abnormal CS whereas 82% had abnormal VERs. There was no correlation between the degree of abnormalities in CS and VERs. There was no significant difference between CS determined in the vertical and horizontal orientation; however, examination in the vertical orientation increased the number of abnormalities detected by 2 (5%). We conclude that although CS, using the CLCG, is abnormal in a proportion of multiple sclerosis patients its detection is not clinically useful and is insensitive as a measure of subclinical optic neuropathy in multiple sclerosis.\r"

The authors review their surgical experience between 1975 and 1985 with 50 patients afflicted with symptomatic Chiari malformations. Any patient with associated myelomeningocele, tethered spinal cord, lipoma, or diastematomyelia was excluded from this series. Forty-one patients had Chiari I malformations, seven were classified as having Chiari II, and two as having Chiari III. The presentation of pediatric and adult patients was identical. Treatment was directed at the posterior fossa pathology. Seven patients with accompanying ventral bone compression underwent transoral decompression of the cervicomedullary junction, 42 had posterior decompressive procedures, and six received ventriculoperitoneal shunts. The posterior decompression included opening the outlet foramina of the fourth ventricle, occluding any communication between the spinal cord central canal and the obex, shunting the fourth ventricle, and placing a dural graft. Postoperatively, 20% of the patients are asymptomatic, 66% improved, and 8% stabilized; in 6% the disease has progressed in spite of multiple procedures. Preoperative signs that are predictive of a less favorable outcome include muscle atrophy, symptoms lasting longer than 24 months, ataxia, nystagmus, trigeminal hypesthesia, and dorsal column dysfunction (p less than 0.05, chi-square test). A model based on the presence or absence of atrophy, ataxia, and scoliosis at the time of the preoperative examination has been generated that allows prediction of long-term outcome at the 95% confidence level.\r"

All are methods of reversing the flow of blood from the external carotid artery system into the cortical branches of the MCA. As moyamoya disease advances, these operations alone will predictably not correct the deterioration in blood flow in the territory of the anterior cerebral artery. It was noted in a case of moyamoya disease with intraventricular hemorrhage that a burr hole, made in the frontal region for drainage purposes, induced marked neovascularization. Since then, similar frontal burr holes have been made in five juvenile cases of moyamoya disease; this procedure involved making a burr hole in both frontal bones and incising both the dura and the arachnoid membrane. In two cases a frontal burr hole in both frontal bones and incising both the dura and the arachnoid membrane. In two cases a frontal burr hole was placed simultaneously with EMS, and in the others the frontal burr hole was made following EMS. The clinical symptoms improved after the frontal burr hole was made, and dynamic computerized tomography revealed improved circulation in the frontal regions. Together with conventional surgical therapy for juvenile cases of moyamoya disease, this operation is considered beneficial both to the circulation in the frontal region and for the protection of frontal brain function.\r"

There was a striking similarity in mortality rates at both centers when comparing patients with the least severe head injuries and those with the most severe injuries according to the motor score of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS M). However, in the group with an abnormal but purposeful motor response (GCS M = 5), the mortality rate was 12.5% in New Delhi versus 4.8% in Charlottesville (p less than 0.01). The relative absence of prehospital emergency care and the delay in admission after head injury in New Delhi are cited as two possible causes for the differences in mortality rates in this subgroup of patients with \"moderate\" head injuries.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen free radicals such as superoxide radical and iron-catalyzed hydroxyl radical generated by the superoxide system have been implicated in the genesis of brain edema. Therefore, deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, could potentially be used to treat brain edema. To examine this hypothesis, vasogenic brain edema was produced in 48 cats by a cortical freezing lesion. The animals were separated into three groups: Group 1 comprised 14 cats that received no DFO and were sacrificed at 6 or 24 hours; Group 2 consisted of 12 cats that were treated with DFO (50 mg/kg/ml, intravenously) at 15 minutes before the lesion was made and 60 minutes later and were sacrificed at 6 or 24 hours; and Group 3 included 12 cats that were treated with DFO (50 mg/kg/ml, intravenously) at 15 minutes after the lesion was produced and 60 minutes later and were sacrificed at 6 or 24 hours. The effect of DFO on arterial blood pressure was also studied in the remaining 10 cats. Brain water content in eight sampling areas was measured by the specific gravity method. Blood-brain barrier disruption was assessed by spread of Evans blue dye with planimetry. Specific gravity values at 6 and 24 hours were significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 animals. Areas of Evans blue dye extravasation at 6 and 24 hours were significantly reduced in Group 2 relative to Group 1. Group 3 cats showed improvement in specific gravity values and Evans blue extravasation at 6 hours, but not at 24 hours. The iron chelator DFO prevented early development of brain edema; thus, this oxygen free radical scavenger may provide a foundation for a new therapy for brain edema.\r"

This study documents the light and electron microscopic features of posttraumatic syringes obtained from two patients who underwent surgical cordectomy. The syringes were lined largely by cell processes of astrocytes. Small regions near the caudal end were lined by flattened ependymal cells that lacked surface specializations. These were thought to represent remnants of the central canal ependyma. The ultrastructural appearance of the syrinx was similar to that of the communicating syringomyelia as well as the periventricular changes that accompany hydrocephalus. The authors conclude that the changes represent the nonspecific sequelae of a distensile force within the syrinx cavity.\r"

  ".W": "A new model of traumatic axonal injury has been developed by causing a single, rapid, controlled elongation (tensile strain) in the optic nerve of the albino guinea pig. Electron microscopy demonstrates axonal swelling, axolemmal blebs, and accumulation of organelles identical to those seen in human and experimental brain injury. Quantitative morphometric studies confirm that 17% of the optic nerve axons are injured without vascular disruption, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) studies confirm alterations in rapid axoplasmic transport at the sites of injury. Since 95% to 98% of the optic nerve fibers are crossed, studies of the cell bodies and terminal fields of injured axons can be performed in this model. Glucose utilization was increased in the retina following injury, confirming electron microscopic changes of central chromatolysis in the ganglion cells and increased metabolic activity in reaction to axonal injury. Decreased activity at the superior colliculus was demonstrated by delayed HRP arrival after injury. The model is unique because it produces axonal damage that is morphologically identical to that seen in human brain injury and does so by delivering tissue strains of the same type and magnitude that cause axonal damage in the human. The model offers the possibility of improving the understanding of traumatic damage of central nervous system (CNS) axons because it creates reproducible axonal injury in a well-defined anatomical system that obviates many of the difficulties associated with studying the complex morphology of the brain.\r"

  ".W": "In order to examine nerve regeneration under conditions in which the basal laminae of the glial limiting membranes (GLM) and blood vessels were preserved intact, the intraorbital segment of adult rat optic nerve was frozen locally. During the next 3 months, degenerative and regenerative changes in axons and glial cells were observed by light and electron microscopy. On the day after treatment, all the myelinated and unmyelinated axons in the central zone of the lesion were damaged. The astrocyte endfeet of the GLM as well as the blood vessels were extensively disrupted, while their basal laminae were preserved apparently intact as a continuous sheet. Three days after treatment, regenerating axons appeared in the central zone of the lesion. They contained various numbers of clear and dense-cored vesicles as well as some smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The regenerating axons gradually increased in number, especially beneath the pial and perivascular surfaces of the lesion, where an abundance of regenerating axons was found 3 months after treatment. A few of these axons were abnormally remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. In addition to this axonal regeneration through the intraoptic nerve compartment, fine regenerating axons were seen growing out through GLM into the pial connective tissue 3 weeks after treatment. Astrocyte endfeet of the GLM became irregular in contour, protruding in a fern-leaf fashion into the pial connective tissue. Fine naked axons grew out through these protrusions and subsequently increased in number, vigorously growing in large bundles both proximally and distally along blood vessels in the pial connective tissue. Bundles of regenerating axons extended as much as 1.5 mm from the site of the lesion 3 months after surgery. These bundles were covered by thin processes of pial or arachnoidal non-neuronal cells, and the regenerating axons remained unmyelinated. The above findings indicate that under well-nourished conditions, adult mammalian optic nerve exhibits considerable regenerative ability.\r"

To investigate whether formaldehyde-treated casein exerts this hypocholesterolemic effect in the same manner as soybean protein, rabbits were fed high or low cholesterol diets containing soybean protein, casein, formaldehyde-treated casein or a mixture of casein and formaldehyde-treated casein. Formaldehyde-treated casein was hypocholesterolemic when fed in a low, but not in a high, cholesterol diet. The hypocholesterolemic effect of soybean protein was independent of the amount of cholesterol included in the diet. In contrast to rabbits fed soybean protein, steroid absorption in those fed formaldehyde-treated casein did not differ from that in rabbits fed native casein. Furthermore, the absorption of phosphorus and nitrogen was lower in rabbits fed formaldehyde-treated casein than in those fed native casein, whereas the absorption found in rabbits fed soybean protein resembled that of their casein-fed counterparts. The diets containing soybean protein and formaldehyde-treated casein produced a comparable ratio of lysine to arginine in serum. The results presented in this paper indicate that the hypocholesterolemic action of dietary formaldehyde-treated casein does not resemble that of soybean protein.\r"

The amino acid pattern of the three insect meals indicated that methionine should be the first limiting amino acid for growing rats. In the rat bioassay, weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed graded levels of the five proteins in purified diets and the response (weight or nitrogen gain) evaluated as a function of nitrogen intake. The individual nitrogen intake-animal response results could be described by a series of curves using a four-parameter logistic model. The use of parameter sharing permitted the full range of responses to be described so that statistical differences between the dose-response curves could be identified. When used for either weight maintenance, nitrogen equilibrium, maximum weight gain or maximum nitrogen retention, the five protein sources could be ranked in the following order: LA greater than HCM greater than MCM = SP greater than TCM. Relative to lactalbumin, the value of all four protein sources decreased with increasing nitrogen intake. The low values obtained for TCM may have been related to factors other than protein quality. The results of this study indicate that some insect proteins are equivalent or superior to soy protein as a source of amino acids for growing rats.\r"

The three structurally unique types of cellulose used in the study were a commercial microcrystalline cellulose, a ball-milled cellulose, and an acid-swollen cellulose. The ball-milled cellulose and the acid-swollen cellulose were prepared from the microcrystalline cellulose starting material. Differences in structure between the types of cellulose were determined by X-ray diffraction measurements and by analysis of their in vitro enzymatic saccharification. The extent of fermentation of each type of cellulose within the rat intestinal tract was determined. Each of the three types of cellulose had a unique structure with respect to its measured crystallinity index and its rate of degradation in vitro by cellulase enzymes. The measured in vivo digestion coefficient for microcrystalline, ball-milled, and acid-swollen cellulose was 8.8, 12.2 and 20.3%, respectively. This represents a significant difference (P less than 0.05) in the extent of fermentation of the different structural types of cellulose within the rat intestine. The results demonstrate that modifying the structural properties of dietary cellulose can affect in vivo response.\r"

Four pigs from each diet were killed on d 17, 34, 48 and 66. From d 34 until slaughter 14 and 32 d later, all remaining pigs were fed the control diet ad libitum. High fiber resulted in significantly higher relative weight of the total gastrointestinal tract after 34 d and higher relative stomach weight up to d 48. Compared with the control diet, the high protein diet resulted in increased relative liver and kidney weights up to d 48. The number of proteolytic and cellulolytic bacteria increased in the colon contents of pigs fed a high protein or high fiber diet, respectively, but declined to below control values within 14 d of transferring pigs from the high protein or high fiber diet to the control diet. The results indicate that diet composition plays a more specific role in visceral organ hypertrophy than can be explained by the normal relative changes in organ size as body weight increases. Thus, high dietary fiber and protein may indirectly increase the animal's maintenance requirement by causing a repartitioning of nutrients from the edible carcass to the visceral organs.\r"

  ".W": "Rats administered excess nicotinamide and nicotinic acid were studied to determine the metabolic fate of pharmacological levels of these compounds. When a large amount of nicotinamide (500 mg/kg body wt) was intraperitoneally injected into rats, 32% of the dose was excreted as nicotinamide, 11% as N1-methylnicotinamide (MNA), 10% as nicotinuric acid, 5% as nicotinic acid, 3% as N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4-pyr) and 2% as N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2-pyr) during d 1 after the injection. Urinary excretion of these compounds gradually decreased with time and returned to normal by d 3. Urinary excretion of nicotinic acid and nicotinuric acid was observed only on d 1. When a large amount of nicotinic acid (500 mg/kg body wt) was intraperitoneally injected into rats, 55% of the dose was excreted as nicotinic acid and 15% as nicotinuric acid during d 1, and no excretion of these compounds was observed thereafter. The increase in excretion of nicotinamide, MNA, 2-pyr and 4-pyr was slight even on d 1. Excretion of nicotinic acid, nicotinuric acid, nicotinamide, MNA, 2-pyr and 4-pyr returned to normal levels on d 2. From these results, the different fates of excess nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are discussed.\r"

The experiment reported herein was performed to test this hypothesis. When a 10, 20 or 40% casein diet supplemented with 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4% L-methionine, respectively, was fed to rats, the urinary excretion of MNA decreased, and that of 4-pyr increased, as the level of dietary casein and methionine increased. Therefore, the ratio of (2-pyr + 4-pyr)/MNA increased with increasing dietary casein and methionine levels. When the limiting amino acids of casein or soy protein isolate were added to a low casein or low soy protein isolate diet, the urinary ratio of (2-pyr + 4-pyr)/MNA also increased. These results indicate that the increased urinary ratio of (2-pyr + 4-pyr)/MNA can serve as a biological marker for adequate amino acid intake.\r"

  ".W": "Adult cats with normal renal function were fed a nutritionally balanced, vitamin A-replete, experimental dry diet with or without ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) for 6 mo to study the effects of chronic dietary acidification on acid-base parameters and the metabolism of selected minerals. Dietary balance studies were performed monthly. Blood and urine samples were collected monthly to evaluate acid-base parameters, plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1.25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels. Ammonium chloride-treated cats had significantly lower blood and urinary pH, and lower blood bicarbonate concentrations. Treated cats also had higher blood ionized calcium concentrations, hypercalciuria and lower intestinal calcium absorption relative to baseline (prior to feeding the experimental diet) and to control cats. This resulted in the development of lower calcium balance in the first several months. PTH levels were unaffected by dietary acidification; however, 1.25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels were significantly decreased in treated cats. Treated cats had negative potassium balance during 5 mo of dietary acidification. Magnesium, sodium, and phosphorus balances were lower, but positive, in treated cats compared to control cats. Cats consuming the NH4Cl-supplemented diet had increased chloride balance. Thus, chronic dietary acidification with 1.5% NH4Cl produced chronic metabolic acidosis and lower or negative, calcium and potassium balance.\r"

Test meals fed to zinc-depleted and to zinc-adequate rats contained grain harvested from plants grown in nutrient solutions with varying amounts of zinc and selenium. Absorption of intrinsic 65Zn by zinc-depleted rats ranged from about 46 to 57% of the dose, and 65Zn absorption decreased as the selenium content of the grain increased. Absorption of intrinsic 65Zn by zinc-adequate rats ranged from about 21 to 26% of the dose, and 65Zn absorption was not affected by the amount of either zinc or selenium in the meal. Absorption of intrinsic 75Se ranged from about 43 to 52% of the dose in zinc-depleted rats and from about 35 to 48% of the dose in zinc-adequate rats. Absorption of intrinsic 75Se by zinc-adequate rats decreased as the zinc content of the grain increased. Relative to the absorption and retention by rats of intrinsic zinc and selenium in wholewheat grain, interactions occurred between natural forms of zinc and selenium at concentrations potentially encountered in wheat. Selenium had an antagonistic effect on zinc absorption by zinc-depleted rats, and zinc had an antagonistic effect on selenium absorption by zinc-adequate rats.\r"

Day-old chickens with limited vitamin A reserves, the progeny of marginally vitamin A-deficient hens, were fed purified diets containing either marginal (120 retinol equivalents/kg diet, ad libitum) or adequate (1200 retinol equivalents/kg diet, ad libitum or pair-fed) levels of vitamin A for a period of 10 wk. At 4 wk of age, half of the chickens in each group were infected intraocularly with the lentogenic, i.e., mildly pathogenic, La Sota strain of NDV. Within 1 wk of infection, plasma retinol levels in the infected, marginally vitamin A-deficient chickens showed a significant and persistent decrease compared to their noninfected counterparts fed the same diet. Moreover, infection with NDV resulted in increased rates of morbidity in the marginally vitamin A-deficient chickens compared with nondeficient chickens. The results of this study indicate that pre-existing marginal vitamin A status increases the severity of disease following NDV infection, and that infection with NDV reduces marginal plasma vitamin A levels to levels which can be regarded as deficient.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of Newcastle disease virus (NDV, La Sota strain) infection on vitamin A metabolism was investigated in chickens maintained on normal or marginal vitamin A intake. NDV, a virus of the Paramyxoviridae family that primarily affects epithelial tissue, was administered at 4 wk of age. Plasma levels of retinol, retinol-binding protein and, to a lesser extent, transthyretin were found to be significantly lower during both the acute and postacute phases of infection in chickens fed a diet marginally deficient in vitamin A compared to noninfected birds fed the same diet, while vitamin A content in liver was unaffected. However, in chickens fed adequate vitamin A, NDV infection did not influence the parameters measured. Levels of retinol-binding protein in liver were significantly increased by inadequate vitamin A nutriture, but infection partly reduced this increase. The results suggest that the reduced vitamin A status in marginally vitamin A-deficient chickens infected with NDV can be attributed to a combination of a direct effect of the virus on retinol-binding protein metabolism in liver and an increased rate of utilization and catabolism of retinol and retinol-binding protein by extrahepatic tissues.\r"

In an effort to isolate predictive factors, the records of 235 patients were analyzed to determine the pretreatment facial morphology, the amount of advancement, the amount of relapse, and the duration of relapse. No relationship was found between any of the measures of facial morphology and relapse. However, the amount of advancement, the amount of relapse, and the duration of relapse all were found to be strongly related. It was found that all patients shared a similar facial morphology, and thus no influence of facial form on relapse would be expected from this group. The relationships between advancement and relapse could be attributed to neuromuscular adaptation, which would be more prolonged and more extensive in instances of greater advancement, and thus give rise to relapse of greater extent and duration. It is therefore suggested that mandibular advancements of greater than 10 mm be fixed more rigidly and for a greater length of time than those of lesser magnitude.\r"

Nonspecific binding, defined using 2 microM (+)-butaclamol, was less than 10% of the total ligand bound at the Kd of the receptor for [125I]IBZM. Direct binding, competition and kinetic experiments indicated that [125I]IBZM bound to a homogeneous population of binding sites. The rank order of potency for inhibition of the binding of [125I]IBZM by antagonists and agonists was found to be consistent with the pharmacological profile expected of a D2 receptor. The affinities of [125I]IBZM for membrane-associated and detergent-solubilized binding sites were essentially identical (Kd congruent to 0.4 nM). This result contrasts with findings obtained in studies with [3H]spiroperidol, where a marked decrease in the affinity of the receptor for the ligand has been observed during detergent solubilization and purification of the receptor. The high selectivity, nanomolar affinity and high specific activity of [125I]IBZM and the results obtained in studies with detergent extracts suggest that [125I]IBZM will be a particularly useful ligand for studies of D2 receptors in the presence of detergents.\r"

  ".W": "The functional antidopaminergic potencies of the atypical antipsychotic drug thioridazine (THD), as well as its active metabolites mesoridazine (MES) and sulforidazine (SUL), were assessed by testing their blockade of the inhibitory effects of endogenous dopamine (DA) or apomorphine on the electrically evoked release of radiolabeled DA and acetylcholine (ACh) from perfused rabbit striatal slices. These functional comparisons (reflecting presynaptic and postsynaptic DA receptors, respectively) were correlated with potency estimations of these drugs in competing for D2 DA receptors (i.e., [3H]spiperone binding sites) in rabbit striatal homogenates. Similar orders of potency (SUL greater than MES much greater than THD) were found for blockade of pre- and postsynaptic DA receptors modulating DA and ACh release, respectively, as well as in competing for [3H]spiperone binding sites in the striatum. MES, SUL and haloperidol were 2 to 3 times more potent at DA release modulatory receptors than postsynaptic DA receptors. In contrast, THD was 8 times more potent at antagonizing the apomorphine-induced inhibition of DA release than against apomorphine's effect on ACh release. THD was virtually inactive in antagonizing the inhibition of ACh release induced when nomifensine was used to increase endogenous synaptic DA, despite significantly antagonizing these effects on DA release in the same slices. Together, these data indicate that: 1) MES and SUL are responsible for a significant part of the antidopaminergic effects attributed to THD; 2) THD should produce less cholinergic activation than other neuroleptics; and 3) that nonreceptor-mediated effects at high THD concentrations may mask effects due to receptor blockade.\r"

  ".W": "The anticholinergic properties of thioridazine (THD) and its metabolites mesoridazine (MES) and sulforidazine (SUL) were compared to the antimuscarinics atropine and quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB). THD, MES and SUL were virtually inactive in antagonizing the carbachol-induced inhibition of evoked ACh release from perfused rabbit striatal slices. This lack of effect was seen even when dopamine influences were abolished by treatment with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The lack of functional anticholinergic potency contrasted with the affinity of THD for muscarinic receptors measured as competition for [3H]QNB binding sites in striatal homogenates (Ki values: atropine, 2.7 nM; THD 14 nM; SUL, 66 nM; and MES, 90 nM). Both atropine and QNB blocked carbachol-induced inhibition of ACh release in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 values vs. 3 microM carbachol: 0.5 nM for QNB; 1.25 nM for atropine). THD, only 5 times less potent than atropine in competing for [3H]QNB binding sites, was inactive in antagonizing carbachol-induced ACh release. At very high concentrations (3-30 microM), THD, MES and SUL did enhance dopamine efflux and inhibit ACh release. In summary, the lack of effect of THD on release modulatory muscarinic receptors suggest that THD is selective for the M1 subtype. Because the M2 subtype is a small fraction of the total population in the striatum, it is not surprising that they would escape recognition in the QNB binding assays. These data suggest that inhibition of ACh release may contribute to the actions of THD only at very high doses, or when drug accumulation is abnormal.\r"

Plasma concentrations were measured 24 hr after dosage, and the EEG power spectrum was simultaneously computed by fast-Fourier transform to determine the percentage of total EEG amplitude occurring in the 13-30-Hz range. Low and high dose lorazepam did not differ significantly in distribution volume (1.89 versus 1.81 l/kg) or elimination half-life (11.5 versus 12.2 hr); clearance was slightly although significantly reduced at the higher dose (2.08 versus 1.88 ml/min/kg, P less than .005). EEG effects were of relatively slow onset, reaching their maximum change over baseline 30 min after infusion. The duration of action was prolonged, with the fraction of EEG activity in the 13-30-Hz range still significantly above baseline 8 hr after the 0.045 mg/kg dose. Five of these subjects received 0.15 mg/kg of i.v. diazepam in a companion study of identical design. EEG effects of diazepam were shorter than those of lorazepam, probably because of the more rapid and extensive decline in plasma diazepam concentrations in the postinfusion distribution phase. In addition, the onset of diazepam's effect was immediate. In male CD-1 mice that received i.v. diazepam (8.3 mg/kg) or lorazepam (3.3 mg/kg), the brain:plasma concentration ratio was maximal 2.5 min after dosage for diazepam, but equilibration was delayed at least 30 min after dosage for lorazepam. Thus the slow onset of action of lorazepam is probably attributable to slow entry into brain.\r"

This compound was characterized by its chromatographic and electrochemical properties and identified by mass spectroscopy and NMR as tryptamine-4,5-dione (4,5-DKT). In in vitro superfusion experiments, 10(-5)M 4,5-DKT significantly increased the basal 5-HT efflux from both rat hippocampal and striatal fragments. In contrast, 10(-5) M 4,5-DKT did not change the release of dopamine or its metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from striatal fragments. Continuous perfusion of 4,5-DKT did not modify the effect of KCl on either 5-HT or dopamine release from both brain areas. In in vitro incubation experiments, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M 4,5-DKT evoked 5-HT efflux from rat hippocampus in a dose-dependent fashion. When 10(-4) and 10(-5) M fluoxetine was incubated with 10(-6) M 4,5-DKT, it partially blocked 4,5-DKT-induced 5-HT release. Pargyline, at 10(-5) M inhibited significantly the 5-hydroxyin-doleacetic acid efflux, but did not modify the 4,5-DKT-stimulated 5-HT release. Incubation of 4,5-DKT with glutathione (GSH) and mercaptoethanol indicated that 4,5-DKT binds to sulfhydryl groups. An evidence of GSH-4,5-DKT conjugate was also observed after incubation of 4,5-DKT with a brain homogenate. The interaction of 4,5-DKT with GSH or mercaptoethanol was blocked effectively with N-ethylmaleimide. It is possible that sulfhydryl groups are involved in the mechanism of 4,5-DKT action on 5-HT release.\r"

Rats injected with gentamicin exhibited: 1) increased urinary excretion of the brush border membrane enzyme alanine aminopeptidase and the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase after the first injection; 2) increased total phospholipid and malondialdehyde but decreased catalase activity in the renal cortex; 3) elevation of serum creatinine and depression of creatinine clearance and 4) extensive proximal tubular cell necrosis all determined 24 hr after the last injection of gentamicin. Rats injected with gentamicin plus PAA also exhibited increased urinary excretion of alanine aminopeptidase not different in magnitude from that of rats injected with gentamicin alone, whereas N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase rose more slowly and returned to base line by day 4. Total renal cortical phospholipid was elevated to the same extent in the two groups. Malondialdehyde was not different from control and catalase activity was significantly less depressed in rats injected with gentamicin plus PAA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PCP and its related compounds produced a concentration-dependent depression of the monosynaptic reflex with a relative potency as follows: PCP = 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine greater than 1-(1-m-aminophenylcyclohexyl)piperidine much greater than 1-(1-m-nitrophenylcyclo-hexyl)piperidine approximately MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] much greater than (+)-N-allylnormetazocine. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate had no effect on the monosynaptic reflex. The depression of the monosynaptic reflex by PCP was antagonized by serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists (methiothepin, spiperone and ketanserin) but unaffected by noradrenergic (phentolamine and timolol), dopaminergic (chlorpromazine and pimozide) and cholinergic antagonists (atropine and mecamylamine). Whereas 5-HT and a putative 5-HT releaser, p-chloroamphetamine, also depressed the monosynaptic reflex, the blockade of monoamine uptake by imipramine did not. Furthermore, pretreatment of rats with desipramine and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine largely diminished the depression of the monosynaptic reflex by PCP and p-chloroamphetamine while enhancing the depressant action of 5-HT. These results suggest that PCP acts at sites located on presynaptic terminals of spinal serotonergic neurons, enhancing 5-HT release and thereby depressing the monosynaptic reflex.\r"

Subjects earned monetary reinforcement by correctly identifying the training drugs by letter code. Other subjective, behavioral and physiological measures were also collected. After training, subjects were tested for their ability to discriminate between the three drugs; generalization curves for the training drugs and three mixed agonist-antagonist test drugs (butorphanol, nalbuphine and buprenorphine) were then determined. In generalization testing both hydromorphone and pentazocine produced dose-related increases in drug-appropriate responses and in characteristic subjective effects measures. Butorphanol produced dose-related increases in identifications as pentazocine and in those subjective effect measures increased by pentazocine. Nalbuphine was not consistently identified as either pentazocine or hydromorphone and produced relatively flat dose-response functions on most of the subjective effect measures. At the three highest doses tested buprenorphine was identified in 50% of trials as hydromorphone and in 50% of trials as pentazocine in the discrimination measures and increased subjective effect scales which were characteristic of both hydromorphone and pentazocine. The results are most consistent with butorphanol having the stimulus properties of a kappa agonist and both nalbuphine and buprenorphine having the stimulus properties of partial mu agonists although the profiles of observed drug effects were complicated and not entirely consistent with a simple mu/kappa opioid receptor model.\r"

Plasma concentration was determined after the i.v. and i.p. administration of d10 and d0 drug and the bioavailability of the d10 was found to be 1.3 to 1.5 times the d0. The clearance of the d10 was also smaller than the d0. The d10, which is pharmacologically equivalent in vitro, is metabolized more slowly than the d0 in vitro. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic bioavailabilities exhibited comparable isotope effects, indicating that both responses are due to the actions of the parent drug.\r"

In the rat heart, PD 122860 increased left ventricular contractility, decreased coronary resistance and altered the shape of the electrocardiogram T-wave. All three effects were observed at comparable concentrations of PD 122860. The inotropic response to PD 122860 was reversed by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin and blunted by the Na+-Ca++ exchange inhibitor dichlorobenzamil. The effects of tetrodotoxin and dichlorobenzamil on the inotropic response to the reference Na+ channel stimulant veratridine were comparable to PD 122860, whereas tetrodotoxin and dichlorobenzamil had no inhibitory effect on the inotropic responses to the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin or the Ca++ channel stimulant BAY K 8644. PD 122860 selectively relaxed potassium-contracted aortic rings and inhibited [3H]nitrendipine binding to rat brain membranes, suggesting that the vasodilator activity of PD 122860 is due to Ca++ channel blockade. In contrast to BAY K 8644, PD 122860 did not contract partially depolarized aortic rings, suggesting an absence of Ca++ channel stimulant activity. PD 122860 is a racemic mixture and both the vasorelaxant and [3H]nitrendipine binding inhibitory activities selectively reside in the (+)-enantiomer [(+)-PD 122860]. In contrast, the inotropic response resides with both enantiomers of PD 122860. It is therefore concluded that PD 122860 represents a unique dihydropyridine derivative which possesses both Na+ channel stimulating and Ca++ channel blocking activities.\r"

The biliary output of [3H]MTX was shown to be related to the cholic acid-sensitive mechanism of hepatic uptake of [3H]MTX. In contrast, the biliary output of [3H]MTX was shown to be markedly stimulated by either unlabeled MTX or trimetrexate but not folic acid, demonstrating structural specificity for the biliary output of [3H]MTX distinct from the structural specificity shown for the hepatic uptake of [3H]MTX.\r"

The administration of quinelorane produced dose-related decreases in serum prolactin concentration of reserpinized, male rats and increases in serum corticosterone concentration of male rats. The minimum effective doses (MED) for these effects were 10 and 30 micrograms/kg i.p., respectively. Quinelorane induced increases in 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol-sulfate levels in the brain stem (MED, 30 micrograms/kg i.p.) and decreases in hypothalamic epinephrine levels (MED, 100 micrograms/kg i.p.) in male rats as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection methods. Quinelorane induced increases in extracellular ascorbic acid as determined by in vivo voltammetry in the nucleus accumbens and striatum of male rats. Quinelorane produced concentration-dependent suppression of K+-evoked release of acetylcholine from superfused caudate slices, with an IC50 of approximately 10(-8)M. Quinelorane administration produced dose-related increases in compulsive, contralateral turning in male rats with unilateral nigrostriatal lesions and increases in locomotor activity and stereotypic behavior in male rats. In dogs, quinelorane administration produced dose-related increases in emetic response with an ED50 of 7 micrograms/kg i.v.

  ".W": "Phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAPase) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of lung surfactant. This study compares the effects of prenatal exposure (gestational days 17, 18 and 19) to two drugs which enhance surfactant synthesis: dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg) and terbutaline (2 or 10 mg/kg). Maternal dexamethasone treatment did not cause an initial stimulation of lung PAPase but did eventually evoke a small increase after the 1st postnatal week. The effect was selective in that brain PAPase activity was generally unaffected; liver PAPase was stimulated during the early neonatal period only. Dexamethasone also prolonged the developmental period of peak reactivity of lung PAPase to beta developmental period of peak reactivity of lung PAPase to beta adrenergic stimulation (tested with acute isoproterenol challenge), which ordinarily accompanies genesis of alveoli in the 2nd to 3rd postnatal week. Significant growth retardation was present even at this low dose of dexamethasone. In contrast, maternal administration of the beta adrenergic agonist, terbutaline, resulted in a large increase in basal enzyme activity in the lung during the immediate perinatal period and enhanced the responsiveness to isoproterenol challenge. The effect of terbutaline was accompanied by little or no growth impairment. Thus, although prenatal administration of either glucocorticoids or beta adrenergic agonists can enhance lung PAPase activity and reactivity to stimulation, the two classes of drugs differ substantially in time course of effect and in the propensity to retard growth.\r"

Stimulus generalization curves for physostigmine were steep; complete generalization with physostigmine occurred only at the 0.1 mg/kg training dose. The muscarinic cholinergic agonists oxotremorine, pilocarpine and arecoline were evaluated for physostigmine-like discriminative effects. Oxotremorine generalized with physostigmine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg in four of six rats tested; partial generalization was engendered by this dose in the remaining two animals. Complete generalization with physostigmine was produced in only one of six rats treated with pilocarpine. However, pilocarpine (3.0-10 mg/kg) did engender some physostigmine-appropriate responding in all rats tested. Arecoline (1.0 mg/kg) produced primarily saline-appropriate responding in all animals tested. Neostigmine, eseroline and nicotine were tested for physostigmine-like discriminative effects in order to assess the specificity of the physostigmine cue. Eseroline (1.0 mg/kg), an opioid-like derivative of physostigmine, and neostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) engendered saline-appropriate responding. Similarly, nicotine failed to generalize with physostigmine at doses up to 1.0 mg/kg. The discriminative stimulus effects of physostigmine were sensitive to antagonism by atropine. Complete blockade of the stimulus effects of the training dose of physostigmine was produced by 1.0 to 3.0 mg/kg of atropine. In contrast, a 10-fold higher dose of the quaternary antagonist homatropine methylbromide was necessary to block the discriminative effects of physostigmine. The discriminative effects of physostigmine were not blocked or were only partially blocked by mecamylamine at doses up to 10 mg/kg. The results of these experiments suggest that the discriminative stimulus effects of physostigmine are selective and probably centrally mediated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous works supported the idea that the thick ascending limb of Henle was the target structure for glutathione (GSH) depletion effects. In order to obtain more evidence on this hypothesis, we compared GSH depletion effects with those of two loop diuretics: furosemide and ethacrynic acid. The submaximal tubular effects observed with furosemide were magnified when the kidneys were previously GSH depleted, but maximal tubular effects of furosemide were GSH independent. This last observation suggested that furosemide and GSH depletion have common sites or mechanisms of action. On the other hand, ethacrynic acid tubular effects were always magnified when the rats were GSH depleted. As it has been proposed that the renal actions of furosemide and ethacrynic acid are at least in part mediated by prostaglandins, another set of experiments was performed using indomethacin to examine the possible role of renal prostaglandins in GSH depletion effects. It was observed that indomethacin greatly improved tubular functions in GSH-depleted rats suggesting that an increase in prostaglandins levels should be involved in the renal defects observed during GSH depletion. All these data give additional support to the idea that the thick ascending limb cells may have a special sensitivity to the effects of GSH depletion probably mediated by prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we have analyzed a likely biochemical mechanism underlying the Ca++-sensitizing action of MCI-154 (6-[4-(4'-pyridyl)aminophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-3(2H)-pyridazinone hydrochloride), a novel cardiotonic agent, on the contractile protein system. MCI-154 (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) enhanced the tension development induced by -log molar-free Ca++ concentration (pCa) 5.8 in chemically skinned fiber from the canine right ventricular muscle in a concentration-dependent manner. At pCa 7.0, MCI-154 (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) markedly increased adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities of canine myofibrils and reconstituted actomyosin. In myofibrils and reconstituted actomyosin, MCI-154 (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) caused a parallel shift of the pCa-ATPase activity relation curve to the left without affecting the maximum activity, suggesting an increase in Ca++ sensitivity. MCI-154 (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) had little effect on actin-activated, Mg++, Ca++ and (K+, EDTA)-ATPase activities of myosin. Ca++ binding to cardiac myofibrils or purified cardiac troponin was increased by 10(-4) M MCI-154. These results suggest that MCI-154 enhances Ca++ binding to cardiac troponin C to elevate the Ca++ sensitivity of myofilaments and thus may cause a positive inotropic action in cardiac muscle. MCI-154 may provide a valuable tool for studying the molecular mechanism by which Ca++ regulates the contractile system.\r"

This current was studied with the patch clamp technique using isolated guinea pig and rabbit ventricular myocytes. Nicorandil (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) shortened the action potential duration without any significant change in the resting membrane potential. Under voltage clamp, nicorandil increased the time-independent outward current at potentials positive to -80 mV, and decreased the inward current at potentials negative to -90 mV. The drug did not affect Ca++ current activated upon depolarization from the holding potential of -30 mV, or did it influence delayed outward K+ current on repolarization. In rabbit myocytes, nicorandil did not increase the Ca++-sensitive and -insensitive transient outward K+ currents. When the ATP concentration of the pipette solution was reduced from 5 to 2 to 3 mM, nicorandil produced a large increase in outward current, which decreased slightly with time. The increased outward current was antagonized by raising the intracellular ATP concentration. Nicorandil increased the probability of opening of the ATP-sensitive single channel current without affecting its unitary amplitude. These results indicate that nicorandil activates the ATP-sensitive K+ current, which is responsible for shortening of the action potential duration.\r"

  ".W": "High-affinity binding sites for platelet-activating-factor (PAF) have been identified in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). The aim of this investigation was to assess their functional relevance by characterizing PAF-induced elastase release, an enzyme present in azurophilic granules. At 37 degrees C, maximal release (measured with a spectrofluorimetric method) was achieved with 0.3 microM PAF. PAF analogs (e.g. lyso-PAF, 2-O-methyl-lyso-PAF) and enantio-PAF, which exhibit poor PAF-like activity in binding studies, were very weak releasers of elastase. The degranulation induced by PAF was fully and competitively inhibited by RP 59227, a potent, d-enantiomeric PAF antagonist. This effect was stereoselective and specific inasmuch as this compound was 500-fold more potent than its l-enantiomer and was devoid of effects on the degranulation promoted by N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucine-l-phenylalanine or [5S,12R]hydroxyeicosa-6,14-cis-8,10-trans-tetraenoic acid. The PAF-induced elastase extrusion was enhanced by physiological concentrations of CaCl2 and MgCl2. For instance, 1 mM Ca++ increased by 200% the release produced by 100 nM PAF. The mechanism of this effect is probably related to the capability of Ca++ and Mg++ to enhance the maximum number of [3H]PAF binding sites in whole or lysed PMNs without affecting the affinity (Kd) of the ligand. An additional possibility is that these ions intervene at the level of the signal transduction system leading to degranulation. For a series of 22 known PAF receptor antagonists, belonging to different chemical families, there was a strong correlation (r = 0.95) between their ability to displace [3H]PAF and to inhibit the PAF-evoked elastase release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis of broad specificity of the hepatocellular bile acid uptake system(s) we investigated the kinetics and substrate specificity of Na+-dependent taurocholate uptake in basolateral (sinusoidal) rat liver plasma membrane vesicles in the presence and absence of bovine serum albumin. Bovine serum albumin selectively stimulated the Na+-dependent portion of taurocholate uptake and decreased its apparent Km from 46 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 3 microM, whereas it had no effect on Vmax (4.2 +/- 0.2 nmol.mg-1.min-1). Based on complementary analysis by Dixon- and Cornish-Bowden-plots the following compounds were identified as competitive inhibitors of Na+-dependent taurocholate uptake: cholate (Ki = 140 +/- 30 microM); taurochenodeoxycholate (Ki = 9 +/- 3 microM); chenodeoxycholate (Ki = 53 +/- 6 microM); progesterone (Ki = 110 +/- 30 microM); 17-beta-estradiol-3-sulfate (Ki = 28 +/- 4 microM); bumetanide (Ki = 440 +/- 85 microns); furosemide (Ki = 460 +/- 140 microM); verapamil (Ki = 65 +/- 35 microM); and phalloidin (Ki = 850 +/- 350 microM). In contrast, noncompetitive inhibition was found with bromosulfophthalein (Ki = 12 +/- 2 microM), cyclosporin A (Ki = 3 +/- 1 microM) and 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (Ki = 45 +/- 7 microM). These results support the concept of multispecificity of the Na+-dependent basolateral bile acid uptake system with respect to different bile acids and drugs. In addition, the findings provide further evidence for bile acids and bromosulfophthalein being taken up into rat hepatocytes by different transport systems, thus supporting the assumption of multiple basolateral organic anion \"carriers\" with distinct, yet partially overlapping substrate specificities.\r"

Control binding experiments were performed with membranes from human tissues rich in M1 (hippocampus), M2 (pons-medulla) and M3 (salivary gland) receptor subtypes. Competitive binding experiments with atropine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide did not reveal any tissue selectivity of these ligands. Pirenzepine, a selective M1 antagonist with 11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl] acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX116), a selective M2 antagonist, made it possible to characterize muscarinic subtypes. In hearts from the three species, the low affinity for pirenzepine and the high affinity for AF-DX116 were related to M2 receptors. In rat lung, the high affinity for AF-DX116 and the intermediate affinity for pirenzepine indicate M2 and M3 subtypes. Guinea pig and human lung tissues contain 48 and 67%, respectively, of muscarinic binding sites with high affinity for pirenzepine (M1). The second muscarinic receptor population in human lung might be classified as M3 in view of the cardioselectivity of AF-DX116, but the occurrence of M2 cardiac-type receptors could not be excluded. In guinea pig lung, both M2 and M3 subtypes might occur in addition to M1 receptors. Muscarinic stimulation led to the contraction of guinea pig and rat lung strips but did not significantly affect human lung strips. We suggest that presynaptic M2-muscarinic receptors modulated the M3-induced contraction in the guinea pig lung smooth muscle.\r"

Although removal of the C-terminal phenylalanine residue markedly reduced affinity for the rabbit adrenal cortical receptor, sequential additions of amino acids beginning with phenylalanine did not result in a molecule with significant receptor affinity until the hexapeptide stage was reached. Similar receptor affinities were obtained with the other two possible 6 amino acid fragments in the molecule. None of the possible pentapeptide fragments were active, as was also the case with representative 4, 3 and 2 amino acid sequences. Of the three hexapeptides, only the one containing phenylalanine as the C-terminal amino acid displayed agonist activity on the rabbit aortic strip. The other two behaved as competitive antagonists. These results indicate that 6 amino acids constitute the minimal receptor binding domain present in the angiotensin II molecule and that phenylalanine is crucial at the C-terminus for activating the receptor.\r"

Accumulation of cefodizime was against an electrochemical potential gradient via a saturable process (Km = 470 microM, Vmax = 174 nmol/ml of tissue per min) that was inhibited by metabolic inhibitors (KCN and 2,4-dinitrophenol), hypothermia, a sulfhydryl reagent (p-hydroxymer-curibenzoic acid) and anion transport inhibitors (probenecid and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene -2,2'-disulfonic acid). Accumulation of cefodizime was inhibited competitively by benzylpenicillin with an inhibition constant of aproximately 100 microM. Cefodizime inhibited competitively the accumulation of benzylpenicillin with an inhibition constant of approximately 500 microM. Kinetic analysis using 16 kinds of beta-lactam antibiotics also supported the view 1) that the transport system of cefodizime is shared by benzylpenicillin and 2) that these beta-lactam antibiotics are transported via a common transport system. These findings indicate that the major transport system of cephalosporin antibiotics in the rat choroid plexus is via a carrier-mediated active anion transport process. The affinity of beta-lactam antibiotics for this transport system in the choroid plexus may be a major factor in determining their pharmacokinetics in the cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

These effects were inhibited markedly by a prior 2-hr exposure of the cells to pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin also inhibited exocytosis induced by substance P, mastoparan and compound 48/80, but did not modify the secretory effect of the ionophore A23187. The transfer of rat peritoneal mast cells from balanced salt solution to calcium-free buffer led to a similar time-dependent decrease in their response to substance P and mastoparan. The concomitant absence of potassium from the calcium-free buffer enabled the mast cells to retain their secretory response. These data demonstrate identical dependency for calcium and monovalent ions of the secretory process elicited by substance P, mastoparan and compound 48/80. Pretreatment of mast cells with neuraminidase decreased the secretagogic effect of substance P, mastoparan and compound 48/80 without modifying the efficiency of the ionophore A23187. Thus, sialic acid residues might be involved in the initial binding of peptides and compound 48/80 to mast cells, which activate a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein and allows the increase in phospholipase C activity to induce exocytosis. This sequence of events might characterize the physiological pathway of mast cell activation by peptides, without necessarily requiring selective membrane receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The teratogenicity of phenytoin may be mediated through a reactive electrophilic and/or free radical intermediate which, if not detoxified, may interact with fetal cellular macromolecules and initiate teratologic effects. Glutathione (GSH) maintains cellular physiological processes and detoxifies xenobiotic reactive intermediates. The role of GSH in protection against phenytoin embryopathy was studied by altering GSH homeostasis using 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), an inhibitor of glutathione reductase. BCNU was administered to pregnant CD-1 mice on gestational day 12, in doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg/kg i.p., with or without phenytoin, 55 or 65 mg/kg i.p., given 4 and 24 hr after BCNU. BCNU alone in doses of 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg resulted in a dose-related increase in the incidence of resorptions, cleft palates and postpartum death (P less than .05), and in lowered fetal weight (P less than .05). Fetuses exposed to 50 mg/kg of BCNU had an array of gross abnormalities, and this dose was not used in subsequent studies. BCNU, 25 mg/kg, inhibited GSH reductase activity by 23% in the placenta (P less than .05) and by 30% in the embryo (P less than .05) at 4 hr after treatment. Embryonic, but not placental GSH reductase activity remained significantly inhibited at 24 hr after BCNU. A BCNU dose-related increase in the incidence of resorptions (P less than .0001) and postpartum death (P less than .05) was seen in groups treated with both BCNU and 65 mg/kg of phenytoin, compared to controls treated with either chemical alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of noradrenaline in the anxiogenic action of the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist methyl-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) was assessed in a drug discrimination procedure using yohimbine as the stimulus cue and a conflict procedure using a conditioned behavioral suppression paradigm in rats. The yohimbine cue was antagonized by clonidine (0.03-0.5 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.1-10.0 mg/kg). DMCM (0.1-0.7 mg/kg) only partially substituted for the yohimbine stimulus cue. However, DMCM, in a smaller dose (0.1 mg/kg), significantly shifted the dose-effect curve of the yohimbine cue to the left. This potentiating effect of DMCM on the yohimbine cue was antagonized by Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and by the type I benzodiazepine receptor agonist CL218,872. In the conditioned behavioral suppression paradigm, both clonidine (0.03 mg/kg) and diazepam (3 mg/kg) had an anticonflict effect by increasing responses in the conditioned fear period, whereas DMCM (0.1, 0.5 mg/kg) decreased the responses of rats in the conditioned fear period. This proconflict effect of DMCM was antagonized by muscimol (0.5 mg/kg), a type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, Ro 15-1788 (3 mg/kg) and clonidine (0.01 mg/kg). Our results suggest that the depressive effect of DMCM on the function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptor complex may cause increased noradrenergic activity, which may, in turn, be one of the anxiogenic mechanisms in DMCM.\r"

  ".U": "89311069\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of alpha adrenoceptor stimulation with noradrenaline were investigated in rat ventricular myocytes after blockade of beta receptors with propranolol (1 microM). At room temperature and low stimulation frequency (0.5 Hz), noradrenaline evoked a phentolamine-sensitive increase in contraction amplitude by 22%. The action potentials of myocytes were prolonged. When the sodium current was inactivated by depolarization in whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, noradrenaline caused a small, but highly variable increase in net inward current and shifted the current-voltage relation between -30 and -5 mV to the hyperpolarizing direction. These effects were absent when K+ currents were inhibited by Cs+ substitution. After inhibition of the Ca++ current with Cd++ (0.1 mM), noradrenaline decreased the peak transient outward current; it reduced the steady-state outward current in a concentration-dependent manner (pD2 value, 6.9), but had no effect on the amplitude of the transient component of outward current. Noradrenaline reduced holding current at -40 mV. The inward branch of the inward rectifier was not affected. The noradrenaline-induced changes in membrane currents were significantly smaller in the presence of phentolamine (10 microM). They are therefore considered to be mediated by alpha adrenoceptor stimulation. The reduction in outward currents can explain the prolongation in action potential duration which could contribute to the increase in contractility.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular recordings were made from rat locus ceruleus neurons in the slice preparation in vitro. Depolarizing synaptic potentials (DSP)2 elicited by electrical stimulation were typically 10 to 15 mV in amplitude and 200 msec in duration. Superfusion with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) or the 5-HT1 receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), produced an inhibition of the DSP. The maximal inhibition was 55 +/- 2% (mean +/- S.E.M.). The EC50 for 5-CT was 60 nM, whereas for 5-HT it was 12 microM. Cocaine (10 microM) shifted the 5-HT concentration-response curve to the left and the EC50 to 320 nM. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a selective 5-HT1A receptor ligand, also inhibited the DSP, but only produced about 65% of the maximal 5-CT or 5-HT response (EC50 = 50 nM). A relatively selective 5-HT1B ligand (65-fold 5-HT1B greater than 5-HT1A), 1-(m-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazine, acted as a full agonist (EC50 = 110 nM). None of these compounds had any effects on the membrane properties of the cell at the doses tested. The response to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin was antagonized by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist spiperone (1 microM). The estimated KD for spiperone was 16 nM. At this same concentration, however, there was no effect on the 5-CT-induced inhibition. The antagonist 4-(3-ter-butyl-amino-2-hydroxy-propoxyl)-indol-2-carbonic acid isopropyl ester (LM 21-009, 100 nM) was found to be a partial agonist producing a 26 +/- 4% inhibition of the DSP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The work was aimed at 1) characterizing the development of chronic tolerance to the respiratory effects of sufentanil in anesthetized and awake rats and 2) analyzing the influence that routes of administration of opiates can exert on tolerance development and expression. Tolerance was developed by infusing sufentanil s.c. with osmotic minipumps for 7 days; it was evaluated by injecting acute sufentanil while the minipumps were still maintained. When maximal depression attained was considered, dose-response curves were displaced to the right, the tolerance indexes being 7.3 and 2.6 in awake and anesthetized rats, respectively. No displacement was observed when acute sufentanil was injected i.c.v. and i.v., indicating lack of tolerance. However, several signs of tolerance were detected when the areas under the time-course curve of the effects were considered: faster and more complete recovery of the depression and flattening of the slope of the dose-area under the curve responses, even after i.c.v. and i.v. administration. The results indicate the need for distinguishing between development and expression of tolerance. Differential tolerance can be explained by considering tolerance expression as a deferred phenomenon. In addition, functional compensation stands as a factor of tolerance and as a mechanism responsible for dose-response curve flattening in tolerant subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was the classification of the receptors that mediate 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced responses in dog basilar artery. Isolated preparations from basilar artery of mongrel dogs denuded of endothelium were contracted by 5-HT in the presence of 6 microM cocaine. In the presence of either ketanserin or spiperone, concentration-effect curves for 5-5-HT became biphasic. The responses to low concentrations of 5-5-HT were resistant to blockade by either antagonist. The responses to high concentrations of 5-HT were antagonized by ketanserin and spiperone in a concentration-dependent and partially surmountable manner. The lack of complete surmountability was at least partially due to fade during the determination of the cumulative concentration-effect curves. The pKB values for the component of the 5-HT-induced contractions that was antagonized by ketanserin and spiperone were 9.4 and 10.2 (-log M), respectively. The findings are consistent with the assumption of an interaction of ketanserin and spiperone with 5-HT at 5-HT2 receptors. On the other hand, the response to low concentrations of 5-HT is not mediated through 5-HT2 receptors. This response is antagonized by phentolamine with an affinity approximately 10 times lower than its affinity to 5-HT2 receptors, but not by prazosin or benextramine. It is conceivable that the receptor that mediates the response to low concentrations of 5-HT belongs to the 5-HT1A-subpopulation as suggested recently.\r"

PF AP duration (APD) was increased by KT (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) and shortened at 10(-5) M. KT effect on APD was greater during stimulation at longer cycle lengths and KT induced early afterdepolarizations in two of six PF at [K+]0 = 2.7 mM. Maximum diastolic potential, AP amplitude and Vmax were not changed by KT. In VM, KT (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) prolonged APD; but 10(-5) M KT did not shorten APD, reducing the difference in APD between VM and PF. KT had no effect on slow response Vmax or amplitude but prolonged APD. To analyze whether changes in Na plateau current or transient outward current contributed to KT effects on APD, we used tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4-aminopyridine. TTX shortened APD and in its presence, KT (10(-5) M) induced no further shortening. In contrast, the effect of KT persisted in the presence of 4-aminopyridine. In six anesthetized, open chest dogs, KT prolonged the QT interval, but did not modify QRS duration and epicardial conduction time or induce arrhythmias. KT facilitated the onset of torsades de pointes during epicardial aconitine application.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All histopathologic measurements were conducted on rat sciatic nerves removed at 48 hr after the extraneural injection of one of three concentrations of the local anesthetic 2-chloroprocaine, procaine, etidocaine or lidocaine. All four drugs produced a concentration-dependent increase in every measure of injury assessed by light microscopy with computer-assisted morphometry of transverse 1-mu thick sections. Edema, lipid inclusions and fiber injury were seen predominantly in the subperineurial region and to a lesser degree in the central areas of nerve fascicles. Quantitative electron microscopic evaluation of Schwann cell injury indicated that the Schwann cells of unmyelinated fibers were more likely to undergo lysis after exposure to local anesthetics, whereas those of myelinated fibers were more likely to accumulate cytoplasmic lipid droplets. These quantitative data on the specificity of the regional distribution of nerve injury and of Schwann cell effects are consistent with a direct cellular toxicity of the local anesthetics; however, these results do not preclude a role for toxicity mediated indirectly by changes in the endoneurial environment.\r"

[3H]Metolazone bound saturably to rat kidney sections incubated in vitro with a dissociation constant (Kd) = 3.4 nM and binding site density = 0.14 pmol/mg of protein. Incubation conditions were used that excluded binding to low affinity sites and carbonic anhydrase. Pharmacological specificity of binding was consistent with labeling of physiologically relevant thiazide diuretic receptors, as identified in previous studies of [3H]metolazone binding to renal membranes. Autoradiographs obtained with tritium-sensitive film demonstrated that binding sites were limited to the renal cortex and were relatively sparsely distributed. Higher resolution autoradiography indicated that [3H] metolazone binding sites were localized in a highly specific manner over short lengths of tubular segments, which by their morphology and distribution most likely represented distal convoluted tubules. In the short sections of tubule that contained receptors, labeling was very dense and appeared to be more prevalent over luminal than peritubular surfaces. The intrarenal distribution of [3H]metolazone binding sites provides further evidence for their identity as thiazide diuretic receptors. These results are consistent with physiological studies demonstrating that the early distal tubule is the location of thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransport.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha and PGB2 on isolated rat aortic strips were studied in calcium-free 1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid buffer to explore the mechanisms of PG-induced smooth muscle contraction. In the absence of extracellular calcium, PGF2 alpha and PGB2 induced sustained contractions that were similar to those induced by activators of protein kinase C (PKC) or norepinephrine. These sustained contractions were apparently induced via a pharmacomechanical coupling mechanism because they could be elicited repeatedly in the absence of extracellular calcium and were not affected by changes in buffer concentrations of potassium, magnesium or phosphate. They depended on intracellular but not extracellular calcium because they were reversed by nitroprusside but not by nifedipine, verapamil or diltiazem. Contractions induced by combining either PG with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate or mezerein were consistent with the suggestion that PG-induced contractions were induced via a PKC-dependent mechanism. Moreover, both PGF2 alpha- and PGB2-induced contractions were inhibited noncompetitively by 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine at concentrations known to inhibit PKC but not myosin light chain kinase. These data, combined with those published from other laboratories, suggest that PGF2 alpha and PGB2 induce contraction of the rat aorta, at least in part, by activating PKC. However, PG-induced contractions did not require enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and apparently did not involve the mobilization of intracellular calcium by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The data thus suggest that PGs activate PKC via a novel mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of eleven 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists with varying selectivity for the 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) relative to the 5-HT1 binding site were assessed in rats responding under a differential-reinforcement-of-low rate 72-sec (DRL 72-s) schedule of reinforcement. Three drugs with a 1000-fold selectivity for the 5-HT2 binding site (ketanserin, ritanserin, pipamperone) increased the reinforcement rate and decreased the response rate similar to antidepressant drugs. The two drugs with roughly the same affinity for both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 binding sites (methysergide and metergoline) did not increase the reinforcement rate. The maximal increase in the reinforcement rate after 5-HT antagonist administration was positively correlated with the selectivity of the 5-HT antagonists for the 5-HT2 versus the 5-HT1 binding site. The increase in the reinforcement rate after administration of 5-HT antagonists was not correlated with the affinity of the 5-HT antagonists for the alpha-1 adrenergic, alpha-2 adrenergic, histamine-1 or dopamine-2 receptors. The 1000-fold selective 5-HT2 antagonist xylamidine, which does not pass the blood-brain barrier, did not increase the reinforcement rate or decrease the response rate. Thus, selective antagonism of central 5-HT2 relative to 5-HT1 receptors results in antidepressant-like effects on the DRL 72-s schedule. Furthermore, the specificity of the DRL 72-s schedule as a screen for antidepressant drugs was strengthened by the observation that the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, did not increase the reinforcement rate despite significant decreases in the response rate.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work in this laboratory has suggested that antagonist action of 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptors and agonist action of 5-HT1 receptors results in antidepressant-like effects (increased reinforcement rate and decreased response rate) in rats performing under the differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-sec schedule (DRL 72-s) of reinforcement. Serotonergic mediation of antidepressant drug effects on DRL 72-s behavior was assessed with a series of 5-HT agonists, and blockade of the effects of the antidepressant drugs clorgyline and fluoxetine (which presumably indirectly stimulate 5-HT1 receptors) was attempted in separate experiments with the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist methysergide and the 5-HT neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. Direct 5-HT1A agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine and the 5-HT precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan all increased the reinforcement rate. The 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C agonists m-chlorophenylpiperazine and 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine did not increase the reinforcement rate. The 5-HT2 agonist and 5-HT3 antagonist quipazine also did not increase the reinforcement rate. The monoamine oxidase inhibitor clorgyline and the 5-HT uptake inhibitor fluoxetine increased the reinforcement rate and decreased the response rate as seen with other antidepressant drugs on the DRL 72-s schedule. Methysergide antagonized the reinforcement rate increasing effects of both clorgyline and fluoxetine. Depletion of brain 5-HT with i.v.t. 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine blocked the antidepressant-like effects of clorgyline. These results suggest that central 5-HT1A receptors are involved in mediating the antidepressant-like effects of some drugs on DRL 72-s behavior. These results provide evidence that stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors lead to an antidepressant-like effect on the DRL 72-s schedule and implies that these two receptors may be important in mediating clinical drug effects in depression.\r"

In the present study, we used selective 5-HT and adrenergic antagonists to study the involvement of different receptor subtypes on the effects of m-CPP in conscious, freely moving rats. Hypoactivity and PRL responses were blocked by pretreatment with metergoline but not by pretreatment with other antagonists. BP increases were antagonized by ritanserin (0.1, 0.63 and 2.0 mg/kg) and ketanserin; metergoline, xylamidine or prazosin pretreatment had only partial effects on BP responses. HR increases were antagonized by yohimbine, pindolol, ketanserin and by the two higher doses of ritanserin. After pretreatment with the two higher doses of ritanserin, m-CPP decreased markedly BP and HR. These decreases were prevented by metergoline pretreatment. Norepinephrine and epinephrine responses were dose-dependently attenuated by ritanserin; naloxone pretreatment attenuated epinephrine but not norepinephrine responses. These data suggest that hypoactivity, PRL responses, and cardiodepressive effects of m-CPP are mediated by 5-HT1 receptors. It is likely that the hypoactivity and PRL responses of m-CPP are mediated by 5-HT1B receptors, and the cardiodepressive effects by 5-HT1A receptors. Increases in BP appear to be primarily mediated by stimulation of 5-HT2 receptors. Both adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms are involved in HR responses. The catecholamine responses to m-CPP appear to be partially mediated by 5-HT1C receptors and also by nonserotonergic mechanisms.\r"

New derivatives of XAC in which the primary amino group has been condensed to the gamma-carboxyl group of glutamic acid have been synthesized as prodrugs. These amino acid-XAC conjugates, which are considerably less potent than XAC in competitive binding assays at A1-adenosine receptors, are designed for selective enzymatic activation in the kidneys. The gamma-glutamyl xanthine derivatives are substrates for gamma-glutamyl transferase (EC 2.3.2.2) to generate an amine-functionalized xanthine. N-acetyl-gamma-L-glutamyl-XAC is not active in vivo, consistent with inability of renal acylase (EC 3.5.1.14) to hydrolyze the acetyl group, a prerequisite step for the production of XAC from this molecule. The xanthine derivatives, gamma-L-glutamyl-XAC and gamma-L-glutamyl-gamma-L-glutamyl-XAC are metabolized to XAC and produce a diuresis in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The type of catecholamine receptor involved in the regulation of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) level in chicken retina was compared to that regulating these parameters in the pineal gland. Systemic administration of apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist, resulted in marked inhibition of the nocturnal increase of retinal NAT activity and melatonin content. Apomorphine did not affect NAT activity or melatonin content of the pineal gland. In contrast, clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, inhibited the nocturnal rise in pineal NAT activity and melatonin content although being without effect on these parameters in retina. Apomorphine-induced inhibition of retinal NAT activity was blocked by spiperone, a D2-dopamine receptor antagonist, but not by antagonists of D1-dopamine, alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta adrenergic receptors. Systemic or intraocular injection of quinpirole, a D2-dopamine receptor agonist, in the middle of the dark phase of the light-dark cycle markedly reduced retinal NAT activity and melatonin level, whereas injections of SKF 38393-A, a D1-dopaminergic agonist, had no effect. The inhibitory effect of clonidine on pineal NAT activity was blocked by yohimbine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that NAT activity and melatonin content in chicken retina and pineal gland are differentially modulated in vivo by D2-dopamine and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, respectively. Despite the different types of receptors involved, both tissues may share a common pathway for catecholamine-mediated inhibition of melatonin biosynthesis, i.e., inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Sympathetic nerve stimulation causes a greater vascular response in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared to Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY), i.e., noradrenergic neurotransmission is enhanced in SHR. Prejunctional and/or postjunctional defects in the regulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission by endogenous prostaglandins could contribute to the increased responsiveness to sympathetic nerve stimulation in SHR. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the effects in SHR vs. WKY of inhibition of cyclooxygenase on vascular responses to periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS), norepinephrine (NE) and angiotensin II (ang II) in the in situ blood perfused rat mesentery. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, potentiated vascular responses to PNS and NE similarly in 16-week old SHR vs. age-matched WKY. However, in this age group, indomethacin enhanced responses to ang II more in SHR compared with WKY. To determine whether chronic exposure of the vasculature to high blood pressure might alter the physiological significance of prostaglandin-mediated regulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in vivo, additional studies were conducted in SHR and WKY that were 25 weeks old. In this age group, neither indomethacin nor ibuprofen, an alternative cyclooxygenase inhibitor, significantly potentiated responses to either PNS or NE in SHR, whereas in WKY both indomethacin and ibuprofen potentiated responses to PNS and NE. Also, in these older animals, indomethacin and ibuprofen enhanced responses to ang II equally in SHR vs. WKY. These findings indicate that in aging SHR prostaglandin-mediated regulation of vascular responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation becomes defective. This defect may contribute to the worsening of high blood pressure with age and may be involved in some of the vascular pathology associated with hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To help define the mechanisms involved in the handling of propranolol by normal and injured lungs, we studied the pulmonary extraction of [3H]propranolol in 23 unanesthetized sheep. Extraction of propranolol by normal lungs during a single circulation was characterized by 1) subsequent back-diffusion and pulmonary retention of the drug, 2) no evidence of saturable uptake or binding, 3) no effect of isoproterenol or imipramine, and 4) no effect of increasing cardiac output by treadmill exercise. In lungs damaged by oxygen toxicity, [3H]propranolol extraction decreased progressively to 63% of base line, paralleling progressive arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia. In contrast, [14C]serotonin extraction remained unchanged from base line. Our results suggest that in normal unanesthetized sheep, pulmonary extraction of propranolol occurs primarily by passive diffusion that is flow-limited. Also, lung injury induced by oxygen toxicity in sheep reduces the pulmonary extraction of propranolol. Indeed, in oxygen toxicity, the depressed extraction of propranolol is a more sensitive marker of lung injury than is serotonin extraction.\r"

Thirteen patients received 531 +/- 63 mg/day of thalidomide for 18.8 +/- 8.8 weeks; in 2 the dose was 300 mg/day during 62 and 65 weeks. Seven patients attained complete remission, 5 partial remission, and the last 3 no improvement at all. Remissions lasted 6 years in 1 patient, 2 years in 3, 1 year in one, and varied between 8 months and 8 weeks in 7. After relapse, 5 patients received a 2nd course of treatment and attained remission again. This lasted 24, 10, and 9 months in 3; two are taking 100 mg/day of thalidomide as a maintenance dose and remain asymptomatic after 36 and 30 months. The side effects were drowsiness, constipation, hard swelling of the lower limbs, erythema of the face and limbs with local pruritus or burning sensation, hair loss, cough, nasal obstruction, fever, and skin and mucosal dryness. In 8 patients there was mild eosinophilia (less than 10%) and in 2 leukopenia. A 33-year-old woman showed amenorrhea up to 2 months after stopping treatment. After a 2nd course of treatment, 2 patients developed peripheral sensory neuropathy, which resolved spontaneously in 6 months. We believe these findings justify controlled trials with this agent.\r"

We report 6 patients with the clinical association of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hyperthyroidism. Of interest, in 5 of the 6 patients (83%), we found an antibody directed against a microsomal extract of human thyroid gland which was different than previous microsomal antibodies in that it was a precipitating antibody; we have called it anti-Mic-1 antibody. We investigated the prevalence of this specific autoimmune reaction in 58 patients with idiopathic SLE, 30 with hyperthyroidism, 15 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 25 with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, 45 with rheumatoid arthritis, and 25 healthy controls. No control had anti-Mic-1 antibody. In addition, this antibody was shown to be organ specific. We suggest that patients with the combined association of SLE and hyperthyroidism may represent a different subset in the spectrum of SLE. The high prevalence of this antigen-antibody reaction in these cases may serve as a serological marker of this association.\r"

Three increased risk phenotypes with twice the expected frequencies or more were HLA-DR1,DR4; DR4 and DR4,DR5. Four \"protective\" phenotypes with half or less the expected frequencies were HLA-DR1, DR5; DR2; DR2,DR3 and DR3,DR7.

Moreover, the intensity of both T cell and B cell infiltration correlated significantly with disease activity. Within the group studied 3 previously described immunohistologic categories were identified. These categories could not be distinguished by clinical measurements, but did differ with respect to their capacity for spontaneous in vitro IgM RF synthesis by blood MNC. Our study provides evidence that a relationship does exist between the immunohistologic characteristics and disease severity in RA. Furthermore, the concept of distinct histologic categories of RA representing different immunopathogenic mechanisms is supported.\r"

They differed from patients with SLE in the absence of renal and central nervous system disease, and the lower frequency of DNA antibodies and depressed complement. They had a similar distribution of HLA antigens. Seven of the 22 patients evolved into SLE during the period of followup. There were no clinical or laboratory features which distinguished these patients from the remaining 15 with persistent latent lupus. Patients with latent lupus may represent a mild spectrum of SLE, and evolutionary phase of classic SLE, or a diathesis awaiting other provoking factors.\r"

Occurrence of a primary antiphospholipid syndrome has also been mentioned but not defined. We present 9 young patients who had at least 2 of the clinical manifestations that have been related to high titers of APLA, but had neither SLE nor other recognizable connective tissue disease.

Mesenchymal changes (Kupffer cell proliferation, portal tract infiltration) and parenchymal alterations (nuclear variability, ballooning, fatty infiltration) were very common without statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Slight periportal and/or portal fibrosis was present in 25% of patients without statistical difference between groups. Central fibrosis occurred in 13.5-12.5%.

Jaccoud's syndrome and/or tendinous laxity were not associated to an increased frequency of arthritis, corticosteroid therapy or a longer disease duration, but significantly associated with increased serum PTH levels secondary to chronic renal failure. Hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure should, therefore, be considered a potential factor contributing to the development of Jaccoud's syndrome and/or tendinous laxity in patients with SLE.\r"

We have investigated the effects of homogentisic acid (HGA), the metabolite accumulating in patients with alcaptonuria, on the in vitro proliferation of rabbit and human articular chondrocytes and human fibroblasts. Growth of these chondrocytes in monolayer decreased proportionally to increasing concentrations of HGA (0.001 mM to 1.0 mM). Substantial growth inhibition and morphologic abnormalities of chondrocytes were produced by a concentration of HGA (0.05 mM) similar to that found in serum of patients with alcaptonuria. Human fibroblasts required higher concentrations of HGA for a comparable degree of growth inhibition. The addition of ascorbic acid (0.57 mM) reduced this growth inhibition and prevented the morphologic changes.\r"

Patients with fibromyalgia had higher scores on 29 of the 32 statements. Patients with RA seemed appropriately concerned about health and the possibility of additional illness. By contrast, patients with fibromyalgia were more symptomatic and presented a more unusual and complex syndrome, raising the possibility of a somatoform disorder and also greater personal distress in these patients. On the basis of analyzing the scores of patients with RA, one can also conclude that physical illness alone is not sufficient to drive MMPI profiles into the abnormal range. Patients with fibromyalgia who have a similar degree of pain intensity compared with patients with RA (61.3 vs 60 on a scale of 100) have significantly more abnormal MMPI, and analysis of their MMPI suggest a more complex somatic syndrome and greater psychological disturbance.\r"

We investigated the role of MDR1 gene expression in lung cancer by performing RNA slot blot analysis in samples from a panel of 24 lung cancers, 10 corresponding nontumorous lung tissues, and 67 tumor cell lines of several histologic types. Almost all of the tumors, nontumorous lung tissues, and cell lines expressed low levels of MDR1 RNA. Relatively higher levels were found in only one type of lung cancer, a subgroup of non-small cell lung cancers expressing neuroendocrine markers. No evidence of MDR1 gene amplification or rearrangements was detected. We found no correlation between MDR1 gene expression in cell lines and (a) in vitro chemosensitivity of the cells, (b) prior therapy status of the patients, or (c) clinical response to therapy. We conclude that the clinical multidrug resistance of many lung cancers cannot be explained solely on the basis of expression of the MDR1 gene.\r"

We completed interviews for 230 men and 102 women with lung cancer and 597 men and 268 women controls, frequency-matched to the patients by age and sex. A quantitative dietary history assessed the usual intake of foods rich in vitamins A and C and carotenoids. A clear dose-dependent negative association was demonstrated between dietary beta-carotene and lung cancer risk in both sexes. After adjusting for smoking and other covariates, the men in the lowest quartile of beta-carotene intake had an odds ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.2) compared to those in the highest quartile of intake. The corresponding odds ratio for women was 2.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.1). No clear association was found for retinol, vitamin C, folic acid, iron, dietary fiber, or fruits. All vegetables, dark green vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and tomatoes showed stronger inverse associations with risk than beta-carotene. This observation suggests that other constituents of vegetables, such as lutein, lycopene, and indoles, and others, may also protect against lung cancer in humans.\r"

Expression of a 4.8-kilobase TGF alpha mRNA transcript was detected in nine of 18 tumors. No evidence was observed of any gross amplifications or major rearrangements of the TGF alpha gene in the breast carcinoma specimens. Biologically active and immunoreactive TGF alpha was measured in the pleural effusions or in the ascitic fluids from 37 noncancer and 63 cancer patients. The TGF alpha activity detected ranged from 0.2 to 26 ng/mL in most effusions from both groups. However, 29 of 63 (46%) of the effusions from cancer patients exhibited TGF alpha levels that were 6 ng/mL or higher, whereas only seven of 37 (19%) of those from noncancer patients exceeded this level (P less than .03). In particular, effusions obtained from breast cancer patients showed a significantly higher level of TGF alpha, compared with those from noncancer patients (P less than .001). Effusions from 14 cancer patients also contained elevated levels of two tumor-associated antigens, CEA and/or TAG-72, and within this group, nine also had elevated levels of TGF alpha.\r"

Low intake of salad vegetables and fruit and high intake of salt were clearly associated with stomach cancer development. No association was found with recent refrigerator use, but a halving of stomach cancer risk in subjects who had used a refrigerator for greater than or equal to 29 years persisted after allowance was made for recent diet. Risk was elevated in subjects who, when children, had lived in houses without a larder built specifically for the storage of food.\r"

In this study, we describe the effects of natural and recombinant TGF-betas on the growth and differentiation of a xenograft of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 in male athymic BALB/c mice. Subcutaneous, peritumoral injection of both forms of TGF-beta inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the growth of established human lung tumors. Histologically, tumors inhibited by TGF-beta appeared more differentiated, as judged by reduced mitotic activity and a predominance of highly specialized mucus-secreting goblet-like cell types. These findings suggest that TGF-betas can be useful in the development of novel, perhaps less cytotoxic, cancer therapeutic strategies.\r"

Utilizing the current weights from the Major Trauma Outcome Study, the predicted survival (TRISS) of the total group and of several subgroups was compared to the observed survival. The mean ISS was 29.3. The survival rate for the total group was 70.4%. For the 58.7% who required major operative intervention, the mean time of OR arrival to anesthesia induction was 8.5 minutes. Non-arrested, hypotensive blunt trauma victims requiring therapeutic laparotomy had a higher than predicted survival observed survival = 0.75 versus average TRISS = 0.55; p less than 0.0002) and therefore appeared to benefit from this technique.

In addition, partial-thickness burn wounds were covered with the HCD and the remaining burn wound was treated with silver sulfadiazine. The donor sites and burn wounds treated with HCD healed significantly faster than those covered with fine mesh gauze or silver sulfadiazine (p less than 0.001) and with less pain. The HCD and polyurethane film were equivalent. There were no clinical infections with the wounds that were occluded. The exudate collected beneath the DuoDerm and Op-site on donor sites was added to the tissue culture system and resulted in a modest increase in keratinocyte proliferation. However, the exudate from burn wounds under HCD resulted in a marked increase in cell proliferation (p less than 0.001).\r"

Animals were injected intraperitoneally at t = -36 and t = -24 hours with either cobra venom factor (20 units/kg/dose; n = 56) to delete circulating complement or with saline alone (n = 64). Rats within each subset were then subjected to either a 50% TBSA full-thickness scald burn or sham burn. Cardiac output (CO), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), stroke volume, and cardiac power as well as hematocrit and the change in per cent complement activity were determined at various time periods between 15 minutes and 25 hours after the burn. In normocomplementemic animals the burn produced a marked early (t = 3-6 hours) depression in CO and MAP with a rise in SVR. Over time the hemodynamics returned to normal (t = 12 hours) and eventually approached a hyperdynamic response (t = 24 hours). Serum hemolytic complement activity fell immediately and progressively after the burn, indicating significant complement activation. Complement depletion attenuated the early decline in CO and sharply lowered the rise in SVR in the early postburn period. In addition, complement depletion improved heart rate and stroke volume and appeared to preserve/enhance late (t = 24 hours) cardiac function. This study suggests that complement activation contributes to the depression in cardiac output in the early postburn period.\r"

Followup information for these patients was obtained from medical records at four local Level I trauma centers, death certificates, Medical Examiner's records, and police crime computer files. Of the 501 patients, 263 had medical followup including 148 patients with one trauma and 115 patients with recurrent trauma. Of these 263 patients, 200 (76%) were unemployed and 164 (62%) abused alcohol or drugs. From 1982-1987 142 out of 263 patients were involved in 133 crimes and 52 died. These data suggest that urban trauma is a chronic disease with a recurrent rate of 44% and a 5-year mortality rate of 20%.\r"

The mean age of this group was 32.9 years, with a mean burn size of 36% of total body surface area; 83% were male. Of the 594 patients, 23.7% died and 38.7% had documented inhalation injury. The mean number of red blood cell transfusions received was 19.7, with a range of 0 to 201. Two hundred fourteen patients (36%) had major infectious complications, defined as pneumonia or invasive burn wound infection. A cross-tabulation of predicted mortality, number of transfusions, and infectious complications revealed a significant positive correlation between transfusion number and infectious complications in patients with predicted mortalities between 10 and 70%. Per cent total burn, patient age, presence of inhalation injury, and number of transfusions were identified by discriminant function analysis as significant variables (p less than 0.05) in discriminating between patients with and without infections (85% accuracy). Logistic regression analysis confirmed the above findings, showing a relationship between the number of transfusions received and infectious morbidity which was independent of age or burn size, but no significant relationship between number of transfusions and mortality.\r"

This excluded any patient with clinically diagnosed tamponade or shock. Fifty-one patients underwent subxiphoid diagnostic pericardiotomy for suspected cardiac injuries. Forty patients were normotensive on presentation and 11 experienced transient hypotension. All patients were easily resuscitated in the Emergency Department. The time from admission to operation ranged from 20 minutes to 6 hours (average, 2.5 hours). Twelve patients (23.5%) had hemopericardium at the time of subxiphoid diagnostic pericardiotomy (SDP), and cardiac injury was confirmed at sternotomy in all. Two patients (16%) in the positive group were admitted with systolic blood pressures less than 100 mm Hg compared to nine (23%) in the negative group. One patient had a systolic to diastolic pressure gradient less than 30. Central venous pressures in this group of patients ranged from 8 to 23 cm H2O. Nine patients who had pericardial window solely on the basis of location of the injury had positive findings. All nine patients were normotensive on admission, had CVP's less than 12, and had no other overt clinical signs of injury. This represents an overall occult injury rate of 17.6%. At sternotomy, there were eight ventricular, two pulmonary artery, one aortic root, and one atrial injury, all repaired. Two patients in this group had associated abdominal injuries as did 11 in the negative group, all of whom required operation, and may have explained the hypotension in negative patients. There were no complications of SDP and all negative patients were discharged on the second hospital day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although electrocardiography (ECG) and creatinine phosphokinase isoenzyme (CPK-MB) determination have traditionally been used in determining cardiac injury, recent developments in two-dimensional echocardiography (ECHO) as a noninvasive diagnostic tool have led to its use in detecting structural cardiac damage following trauma. In an attempt to determine the occurrence and consequences of cardiac injury we prospectively evaluated 68 patients at one institution using ECHO, serial ECG, and serial CPK-MB determinations in the first 3 days following hospital admission. Patients were selected who had evidence of blunt chest injury on examination or by mechanism of injury. The mean age of the 68 patients was 36.3 +/- 19.6 years and the mean Injury Severity Score, 21.5 +/- 11.6. Forty-nine patients (72%) were found to have an abnormal ECHO, ECG, or CPK-MB (greater than 3%). Eighteen patients (26%) had abnormal ECHOs consisting of seven right ventricular contusions, three left ventricular contusions, three contusions of both chambers, four pericardial effusions, and one small ventricular septal defect. Only three contusions were associated with elevated CPK-MB and seven with abnormal ECGs. Abnormalities of ECG included 18 patients with S-T, T wave changes, axis shifts (11 patients), and bundle branch or hemiblocks (10 patients). No patient died or experienced serious morbidity as a result of their cardiac injury, including 12 patients who underwent surgical procedures with general anesthesia within 30 days of admission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89311565\r", 
  ".W": "Three hundred forty-three multiple trauma patients with major pelvic ring disruption were studied and subdivided into four major groups by mechanism of injury: antero-posterior compression (APC), lateral compression (LC), vertical shear (VS), and combined mechanical injury (CMI). Acetabular fractures which did not disrupt the pelvic ring were excluded. The mode of injury was: MVA, 57.4%; motorcycle, 9.3%; fall, 9.3%; pedestrian, 17.8%; crush, 3.8%. The LC and APC groups were divided into Grades 1-3 of increasing severity. The pattern of organ injury: including brain, lung, liver, spleen, bowel, bladder, pelvic vascular injury (PVASI), retroperitoneal hematoma (RPH) and complications: circulatory shock, sepsis, ARDS, abnormal physiology, and 24-hr total fluid volume administration were all evaluated as a function of mortality (M). As LC grade increased from 1 to 3 there was increased % incidence of PVASI, RPH, shock, and 24-hr volume needs. However, the large incidence of brain, lung, and upper abdominal visceral injuries as causes of death in Grade 1 and 2 fell in LC3, with limitation of the LC3 injury pattern to the pelvis. As APC grade increased from 1 to 3 there was increased % injury to spleen, liver, bowel, PVASI with RPH, shock, sepsis, and ARDS, and large increases in volume needs, with important incidence of brain and lung injuries in all grades. Organ injury patterns and % M associated with vertical shear were similar to those with severe grades of APC, but CMI had an associated organ injury pattern similar to lower grades of APC and LC fractures. The pattern of injury in APC3 was correlated with the greatest 24-hour fluid requirements and with a rise in mortality as the APC grade rose. However, there were major differences in the causes of death in LC vs. APC injuries, with brain injury compounded by shock being significant contributors in LC. In contrast, in APC there were significant influences of shock, sepsis, and ARDS related to the massive torso forces delivered in APC, with large volume losses from visceral organs and pelvis of greater influence in APC, but brain injury was not a significant cause of death. These data indicate that the mechanical force type and severity of the pelvic fracture are the keys to the expected organ injury pattern, resuscitation needs, and mortality.\r"

Negative local community attitudes toward all pharmacologic treatments, a strong focus on total abstinence by the recovering patient group, and self-elimination of poor candidates in this unselected population appear to be important factors in the poor acceptance of naltrexone.\r"

The vulnerabilities of the conventionally trained mental health therapist are contrasted with difficulties often seen among those whose training and primary experience base is in substance abuse treatment. Emphasis is given to the patient in denial and in early recovery and to the frustrations and power struggles common at those stages. The paper briefly addresses problems manifested by insulated treatment systems and other obstacles to open inquiry and dialogue among professionals.\r"

In this article the usefulness and psychometric characteristics of the Dutch version of the ASI are discussed. Overall, there was no evidence of a general relationship between the ASI ratings of problem severity. The severity ratings showed good concurrent validity, and subscales of selected items in each problem area of the ASI were demonstrated to have good internal consistency reliability. Regression analysis indicated that the ASI items accounted for a considerable proportion of the variance in the severity ratings, indicating a strong relationship between \"subjective\" rating and \"objective\" data. On the basis of the general concept of the ASI and the satisfactory psychometric characteristics, implementation of the instrument in The Netherlands is advocated.\r"

Approaches reveal a common mechanism underlying relapse that involves drug craving, recall of euphoria, environmental cues, denial, myths of being able to sell or use drugs, and painful affect states necessitating use of a multifaceted clinical technique. Empirical validation of a common mechanism underlying relapse establishes a typology of psychological and environmental determinants of relapse for crack cocaine smokers (N = 35) who relapse after hospital detoxification and return a second time. Major findings are that relapse follows a painful emotional state (40%), failure to enter arranged aftercare treatment (37%), or encounters with conditioned environmental stimuli (34%), and involves narcissistic psychopathology and denial (28.5%) and interpersonal stress (24%); 85.7% involve multideterminants. Case examples illustrate the role of multideterminants in relapse. The paper educates clinicians to the integrated theory and multifaceted clinical technique necessary for efficacious treatment of cocaine patients, while the typology predicts probable relapse situations.\r"

Four patients were ineligible and 6 were inevaluable for response but evaluable for toxicity. There were no complete and 9 partial responses among the 56 evaluable patients, for a response rate of 16 per cent. Median duration of response was 26 weeks, with a range of 8 to 50 weeks. Responses were observed predominantly in patients with lung and soft tissue metastases. Patients who had undergone nephrectomy did not show a better response rate than those who had not. Almost all patients had a flu-like syndrome, fatigue and anorexia. Other side effects included leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, liver function disturbances and neurotoxicity. Most of the side effects were World Health Organization grade 1 or 2; no grade 4 toxicity was observed. Antibodies against interferon developed in 6 patients during the course of treatment. However, there was no relationship between the appearance of antibodies and disease progression. The combination of recombinant interferon alpha-2a and vinblastine has modest but definite activity in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, although the role of vinblastine is unclear.\r"

However, upper limits of safety for these treatments have not been established. In an attempt to address this question a comparative study of effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on laboratory values between 2 stone centers, Munich and Tucson, using different treatment strategies 3 to 4 years apart was done to identify possible differing effects. Patient stone burdens were similar. However, Tucson patients received almost twice the number of shock waves. Both groups showed a significant decrease in hematocrit (by 8.7 per cent in Munich and 6.4 per cent in Tucson). Both groups had a significant increase in white blood count (14.5 per cent in Munich and 22.7 per cent in Tucson). In addition, both groups had increased serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase of 43.3 and 59.7 per cent, respectively. However, only the Tucson group showed increases in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase and total bilirubin in 51.5, 40.8 and 46 per cent of the patients, respectively. Further analysis indicated that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was associated with 2 significant short-term changes of blood or serum laboratory values: 1) those presumed to be dilutional from related infusions, rather than extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatments themselves and 2) those presumed to be related to cellular injury after high energy treatments. Elevated serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase and total bilirubin values of Tucson patients clearly were related to higher kilovolts and number of shocks or to treatments on the right side.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The most common reasons for electing an open operation were unsuccessful endoscopic stone manipulation, presence of anatomical obstruction in the intrarenal collecting system or ureter, morbid obesity and underlying medical problems precluding lengthy repeated endourological procedures. Over-all surgical results were excellent. Our study indicates that patients who presently require an open stone operation have complex calculous disease associated with a variety of anatomical and physiological problems. Despite this finding good results may be attained.\r"

One patient with reduced preoperative function required secondary nephrectomy. Three patients with normal function in solitary kidneys had unchanged postoperative function. In the remaining 26 patients preoperative function measured by diuretic renal scanning was compared to 6-month postoperative values. If split function changes of less than 5 per cent were considered insignificant, to allow for inherent statistical errors of renal scanning, preoperative function was decreased in 18 patients, improved postoperatively in 10 and remained the same in 8. In 8 patients preoperative function was normal and remained so postoperatively. Drainage improved in 22 of the 26 patients and was unchanged in 4. Analysis of functional change by Student's t test and the Wilcoxon paired sums test showed significant improvement in mean and median function (p less than 0.001), with the degree of improvement being greatest in patients with the most severely depressed preoperative levels. In addition to producing significant improvement in drainage in ureteropelvic junction obstruction, pyeloplasty arrests functional deterioration in almost every case and improves function significantly in the majority.\r"

  ".W": "The indwelling ureteral stent commonly is used to bypass 2 types of obstruction: 1) intrinsic obstruction usually due to stones or ureteropelvic junction abnormalities or 2) extrinsic compression, for example by retroperitoneal tumor. To determine the success of this intervention at 2 institutions the medical records of all patients undergoing cystoscopic placement of a stent for ureteral obstruction were reviewed. Procedures were classified by several parameters, including the type and location of the ureteral obstruction, indications for stent placement and success of the procedure. Stent failure was defined arbitrarily as clinical occlusion of the stent within 30 days of placement. X-rays were reviewed as available to measure stricture length and location in patients with extrinsic obstruction. Of the procedures at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where silicone stents are used almost exclusively, 23 perforated indwelling stents placed for intrinsic obstruction were uniformly successful. In contrast, of 24 stents placed for extrinsic obstruction 11 failed (p less than 0.0005). At Beth Israel Hospital, where polyurethane stents are used most commonly, all 21 perforated indwelling stents placed for intrinsic obstruction were successful, while 9 of 22 stents placed for extrinsic obstruction failed (5 within the first 24 hours of placement, p less than 0.0005). The only parameter that seemed to be a predictor of stent failure was luminal size, and this only in silicone catheters. The reasons for this surprising failure rate of internal stents in the face of extrinsic obstruction are not known but may be related to previous studies that describe a relationship among ureteral peristalsis, venting side holes and flow rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In selected patients with complex urinary incontinence augmentation cystoplasty and placement of an artificial genitourinary sphincter cuff can be combined successfully without increase in morbidity over that with either procedure performed separately.\r"

Revascularization was technically possible in 7 of 9 patients; 2 had inadequate central arteries. The penile brachial index initially was improved in all 7 patients, although 1 had an early occlusion at 2 months and 1 had a late occlusion at 4 years. Potency was improved initially in 6 of the 9 patients, with longer term improvement in 5 of 9 followed 1 to 8 years. Two patients remain potent currently. The advantages of this technique are a reasonably high technical success rate in selected patients, with improved initial potency in more than half. The disadvantages include technical difficulty, lack of clear-cut selection criteria and unknown long-term results.\r"

Criteria for study entry included a negative physical examination, chest x-ray, bipedal lymphogram, excretory urogram, abdomino-pelvic computerized tomography scan and serum alpha-fetoprotein. Followup consisted of frequent clinical examination, repeat lymphograms, abdominal computerized tomography scans, chest x-rays and serum markers. The purpose of this study was to determine the percentage of patients cured by orchiectomy alone, percentage who ultimately required therapy for occult metastases beyond the testicle, sites of relapse, factors predictive of relapse, and over-all cure rate and treatment morbidity. Of 81 patients followed for 3 to 43 months (median 19 months) only 3 had relapse at 3, 5 and 18 months after orchiectomy with nonbulky retroperitoneal disease: 1 patient had disease 17 months after salvage infradiaphragmatic radiation therapy, 1 had an increase in beta-human chorionic gonadotropin 11 months after radiation therapy, presumably due to occult nonseminoma, and he is receiving chemotherapy, and 1 has not yet completed treatment. Further followup is necessary to determine ultimate survival, since a risk for later relapse exists. However, to date it does not appear as if the outcome has been compromised when surveillance was applied in place of routine adjuvant radiotherapy.\r"

Patients were well matched between the 2 groups on all essential characteristics and risk factors at baseline. Owing to the strict selection criteria and aseptic measures used, the low incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections in the control group (1.8 per cent) compared to none in the cefoperazone group made conclusions and generalization limited due to sample size. In view of the extremely low infection rate it is doubtful that antibiotic prophylaxis had any beneficial role in this selected population.\r"

We reviewed the experience at our center with 28 patients who underwent laminectomy for spinal cord compression secondary to adenocarcinoma of the prostate between January 1980 and November 1985. Patient age ranged from 46 to 82 years (mean age 65.5 years). The most common presenting complaints were back pain (75 per cent), loss of sensation (68 per cent) and loss of bladder function (39 per cent in retention). Postoperatively, 22 patients (79 per cent) had improvement of the presenting complaints. Of the 13 bedridden patients at presentation 8 (62 per cent) were ambulatory postoperatively. Of the 11 patients in retention 6 (55 per cent) were able to void postoperatively. There was no perioperative mortality. Four patients required further surgery, 2 had postoperative pneumonia and there were 2 wound infections. The average postoperative life span for the 17 patients not surviving to last followup was 9.5 months (range 1 to 60 months). The management of prostate cancer patients who have back pain and/or neurological findings is discussed. We believe that the rate of palliation and improved quality of life that decompressive laminectomy can afford patients with spinal cord compression due to prostate cancer justify its use in patients medically fit for the procedure.\r"

We treated in this manner 33 renal and 8 ureteral stones in 25 renoureteral units of 22 children 4 months to 14 years old. No child required any other type of primary stone treatment during this period. Piezoelectric lithotripsy is painless and anesthesia was needed in only 11 children too young to cooperate. With a retreatment rate of 40 per cent, all stones were fragmented completely. After treatment only 48 per cent of the children had transient hematuria, which always subsided within 24 hours. Of the children 14 per cent required analgesics and 5 per cent had fever in the postoperative period. One child needed temporary nephrostomy drainage. Otherwise, the passage of stone debris was remarkably smooth and after 3 months 96 per cent of the renoureteral units were free of calculi. Evidence of soft tissue damage, such as skin ecchymosis, perirenal hematoma or retardation of renal growth, was not observed.\r"

In each case significant renal dysplasia was present microscopically and ultimately the kidney had to be removed. A retrograde pyelogram should be considered whenever a hydronephrotic kidney in an infant fails to visualize, and if this shows a long hypoplastic ureter that cannot be bypassed easily associated renal dysplasia should be suspected and consideration given to nephrectomy rather than pyeloplasty as the primary treatment modality.\r"

A woman with a pure 2,8-dihydroxyadenine ureteral calculus is reported, who represents the third reported case in the United States. Stones comprised of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine are difficult to distinguish from uric acid clinically, making sophisticated crystallographic analysis essential for accurate diagnosis. Treatment differs from that appropriate for uric acid lithiasis due to the limited solubility of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine at pH levels of less than 9. Prevention requires purine restriction and allopurinol.\r"

Liver function tests were performed every three months to detect early systemic metabolic changes. After sacrifice, the simian penises were perfused in situ and examined histologically with both light and electron microscopy. Papaverine resulted in an initially strong erectile response, but this was maintained throughout the length of the study in only two monkeys. In contrast, prostaglandin E1 resulted in tumescence that was maintained in all monkeys over the nine-month period. In addition, the papaverine group had elevated liver enzymes and significant histologic changes with loss of normal architecture on both light and electron microscopy. The other two groups showed only minimal histologic changes or none.\r"

The present study investigates the physiology and pharmacology of bladder regeneration at eight weeks after resection of a major part of the bladder body in rabbits. The following studies were performed on control and cystectomy bladders: 1) in vivo cystometry (prior to and four weeks after the operation, and before the sacrifice at eight weeks); 2) sequential muscle strip study (the strips were obtained by dividing bladder transversely into upper body, lower body, mid-bladder, upper base and lower base); and 3) in vitro whole bladder studies. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) grossly there was no regeneration of the bladder body; the cystometric capacity was increased slowly after the operation primarily due to increased size and capacity of the bladder base. 2) The contractile response of the subtotal cystectomized bladder body to field stimulation and bethanechol stimulation was less than the response of normal bladder body. 3) The contractile response to epinephrine showed that the ratio of alpha/beta adrenergic response was much greater in the cystectomy bladder than in the normal bladder. 4) In the whole bladder study, the intravesical pressure response to field stimulation was about the same in both groups, the response to bethanechol was less for cystectomized bladder, and the response to methoxamine was greater for the cystectomized bladder. 5) The ability of cystectomy bladder to empty in response to both field stimulation and bethanechol was impaired whereas the control bladder fully emptied to both field stimulation and bethanechol. In conclusion, over the eight week period following subtotal cystectomy the capacity increased via distention (and hypertrophy) of the bladder base area as opposed to regeneration of the bladder body.\r"

Therefore, we studied early pre-pubertal versus later pre-pubertal orchiopexy in a cryptorchid rabbit model. Male offspring were divided into four groups with six to nine rabbits in each group: 1) controls (CON); 2) shams undergoing sham operations at both three weeks and two months of life (SHAM); 3) cryptorchid on day 3 with orchiopexy at three weeks and sham operation at two months (O3W); 4) cryptorchid on day 3 with sham operation at three weeks and orchiopexy at two months (02M). All animals were sacrificed post-puberty at six months of age; the tests were fixed in situ by perfusion fixation, embedded in glycol methacrylate, and underwent morphometric analysis in a blinded fashion. The average seminiferous tubular diameter (STD) of the CON, SHAM, O3W, and O2M groups was 234, 160, 116, and 123 microns, respectively. The average testicular biopsy score count (TBSC) of the CON, SHAM, O3W and O2M groups was 9.0, 5.2, 3.5 and 3.5, respectively. There is no significant difference in STD or TBSC between the O3W and O2M cryptorchid groups, and values for both of these groups were significantly different from those of the SHAM group. In addition, a significant effect of sham operation was demonstrated. These results demonstrate no advantage of very early orchiopexy in this model, and are consistent with the clinical literature which, in general, shows reduced reproductive potential of a cryptorchid testis after orchiopexy.\r"

Seven days after denervation achieved by bilateral sacral rhizotomy, the capacity of the denervated bladder increased by 2.2 times as compared with the control (126.3 to 277.3 ml.), and wet weight also increased 4.3 times (3.6 to 15.3 gm.). After 30 minutes incubation in normal Krebs' solution the denervated bladder strips showed significantly increased amplitude of contractions to the cumulative acetylcholine addition than the control. After incubation in normal Krebs' solution for 30 minutes, muscle strips were washed three times with Ca-free Krebs' solution and incubated 30 minutes in this solution. Cumulative Ca2+ replenishment (0.5 to 10 mM) induced dose-dependent contractions of the detrusor muscle strips in Ca2+-free Krebs' solution, where the contractions were significantly stronger in the denervated detrusor muscle than in controls. Pretreatment with 10(-6) M verapamil (Ca-entry blocker) eliminated the enhanced Ca2+-induced contractions of the denervated detrusor strips, while 10(-6) M procaine (Ca-induced Ca releasing blocker) only partially inhibited them. After depolarizing the cell membrane with 40 mM KCl, the Ca2+-induced contractions of the control strips were markedly enhanced but those of the denervated strips were not. These results demonstrate the supersensitivity of the denervated detrusor muscle to Ca2+. We conclude that hyperpermeability of the cell membrane to Ca2+ influx through calcium channels is responsible for supersensitivity of the denervated detrusor muscle to Ca2+.\r"

In the other group of patients with growth negative urine cell cultures (15 patients) six patients (40%) developed a recurrence, three following a growth positive urine cell culture. In the group of 46 evaluable patients in this study, 25 patients developed a recurrence, 21 had at least one growth positive culture. The sensitivity is 84% (21/25). Of 33 patients with positive cultures 21 have had a recurrence (64%) while 12/33 (36.7%) are \"false positive.\" The false negative rate is 36.4% (four of 11 patients developed recurrences not preceded by growth positive urine cell cultures).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of using pulsed laser generated acoustic and plasma optical emission signals to monitor laser fragmentation of urinary stones was studied in vitro. A flashlamp pumped tunable dye laser operating at a wavelength of 504 nm. (coumarin green) was used as the laser source. Acoustic signals were recorded with a hydrophone which has a useful frequency response of up to 350 KHz. Plasma optical emissions were transmitted retrograde along the laser fiber and reflected through a beam splitter to an optical detection system consisting of a series of spectral filters (to transmit plasma radiation from 380 nm.-440 nm. and block any 504 nm. laser light) and a photomultiplier tube. Measurements of acoustic and plasma signals were taken from different urinary calculi, guidewires, catheters, blood, blood clots, bruised soft tissue and normal ureter. Signals were also obtained from stones placed in ureter of an ex vivo bovine urinary tract specimen. Results of monitoring both plasma and acoustic signals show that it is possible to determine, without direct vision, whether the laser is hitting stone, ureteral wall or lumen. Strong plasma and strong acoustic signals are produced by calculi; strong acoustic but no plasma signals suggest that the laser is hitting blood clot or bruised ureteral wall. Absent plasma and acoustic response indicate that the laser is discharging on normal ureter or in the lumen. These distinctions may allow clinical stone fragmentation without direct ureteroscopic vision.\r"

  ".W": "Radioligand receptor binding and autoradiography were used to characterize, localize and compare alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors and muscarinic cholinergic receptor populations in human benign prostatic hyperplastic tissue. The binding of selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 ligands, [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-UK 14,304, to homogenates of human central and peripheral prostate was saturable and of high affinity. Scatchard analysis produced an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.51 +/- 0.10 nM for alpha-1 adrenoceptors, and 2.34 +/- 0.40 nM for alpha-2 adrenoceptors. The mean densities, Bmax, of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors identified in the human adenomatous prostate were 65.9 +/- 12.9 and 36.1 +/- 7.0 fmoles/mg. protein respectively. Receptor autoradiography was used to examine the distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors [( 3H]-QNB), alpha-1 adrenoceptors [( 3H]-prazosin]), and alpha-2 adrenoceptors [( 3H]-rauwolscine) on consecutive sections of benign hyperplastic prostatic tissue. Although both subtypes of adrenoceptor were seen in the stromal component of the hyperplastic prostate, there was a substantial predominance of alpha-1 adrenoceptors. A densitometric computer-assisted analysis was performed on the autoradiographic slides to determine the mean ratio of specific alpha-1: alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the stromal compartment of the hyperplastic tissue. The ratio, expressed as % grain occupancy/unit area, was 3.9 +/- 0.75, which is in agreement with a functional alpha-1 adrenoceptor predominance shown in previous studies. Although sparsely distributed in the stroma, a dense alpha-2 adrenoceptor population was seen in association with blood vessels, and in close proximity to the base of some of the [3H]-QNB-labelled prostatic glandular epithelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Complete surgery, defined as radical inguinal orchiectomy with clear microscopic margins plus radical, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection with extirpation of all gross disease, was performed in 21 patients (75 per cent). All patients received chemotherapy and 20 received radiation therapy according to protocol. Of the patients 16 have survived for more than 5 years with no evidence of disease. Univariate analysis revealed that only the presence of parenchymal metastases at diagnosis (p less than or equal to 0.040) and unresectability (p less than or equal to 0.003) were significant predictors of fatal outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that unresectability was the most important predictor of mortality with an estimated relative risk of 5.8.\r"

  ".W": "The coexistence of ureteropelvic junction obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux was seen in 17 (14 per cent) of 147 consecutive patients undergoing pyeloplasty. These patients were analyzed to determine the therapeutic implications of this association. They fell into 3 clinical groups: group 1--primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction, group 2--ureteropelvic junction obstruction secondary to high grade reflux and group 3--pseudo-ureteropelvic junction obstruction. There were 11 patients in group 1. These patients had incidental low grade reflux. Pyeloplasty should be the initial procedure with use of a nephrostomy tube or Foley catheter postoperatively. Vesicoureteral reflux resolved spontaneously with linear growth in approximately half of the cases. There were 4 patients in group 2. The obstructive uropathy should be treated initially, since primary ureteral reimplantation may provoke acute ureteropelvic junction decompensation. There were 2 patients in group 3. Pseudo-ureteropelvic junction obstruction is suggested when pelvic dilatation on the voiding cystourethrogram suggests obstruction but drainage films or antegrade studies document good drainage. The recognition of pseudo-ureteropelvic junction obstruction is important to avoid surgery on a ureteropelvic junction that is not obstructed. Primary correction of the reflux is appropriate. However, it must be recalled that a fixed kink may rarely develop later leading to true secondary ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which will require surgical correction. We recommend that a voiding cystourethrogram be part of the routine evaluation of children with suspected ureteropelvic junction obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively studied 53 young children (45 less than 4 years old) between 1985 and 1988 with primary vesicoureteral reflux (grades I to V, 74 ureters). All patients had elevated bladder pressures during bladder filling and/or voiding on urodynamic evaluation, which sometimes were associated with abnormal perineal muscle activity. Baclofen, flavoxate, dicyclomine and diazepam were given individually or in combination for each type of dysfunction for 12 to 30 months. Reflux disappeared in 68 ureters (91.8 per cent) and it was downgraded in 6 (8.2 per cent). Urodynamic evaluation at the end of treatment revealed normal bladder pressures in 46 children (83.7 per cent of the ureters in which reflux resolved). Another group of 48 children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (grades I to IV, 67 ureters) seen between 1980 and 1985 was reviewed retrospectively. All patients had been treated with prophylactic antibiotics only. Reflux resolved in 53.7 per cent of the ureters, and it was downgraded in 19.4 per cent, unchanged in 22.4 per cent and upgraded in 4.5 per cent. Urodynamic studies performed in 1985 showed that all persistent cases of reflux in the retrospective group had urodynamic findings similar to those found in the prospective group. These data suggest that vesicoperineal incoordination as well as bladder instability can be important factors in causing and perpetuating reflux, and that medical treatment of these factors individually or in combination may affect therapeutic perspectives of this pathological condition.\r"

Reflux was eliminated successfully in 98 per cent of the 76 ureters treated by reimplantation and in 70 per cent of the 40 ureters treated endoscopically. Although the surgical morbidity of endoscopic surgery appears to be less than that of open surgery, the patients undergoing endoscopic surgery required more hospital admissions, more anesthetics and more micturating cystourethrograms than did those in the reimplantation group. It is concluded that subureteral polytetrafluoroethylene injection does not represent a satisfactory substitute for reimplantation.\r"
