  ".W": "Different types of pain patients used visual analogue scales (VAS) to rate their level of pain sensation intensity (VAS sensory) and degree of unpleasantness (VAS affective) associated with pain experienced at its maximum, usual, and minimum intensity. Women used the same VAS to rate their labor pain during early, active, and transition phases of stage I and in pushing (stage II). Consistent with the hypothesis that the affective dimension of clinical pain can be selectively augmented by perceived degree of threat to health or life, cancer pain patients and chronic pain patients gave higher VAS affective ratings as compared to VAS sensory ratings of their clinical pain, whereas labor patients and patients exposed to experimental pain gave lower VAS affective ratings compared to their VAS sensory ratings of pain. Affective VAS but not sensory VAS ratings of pain were considerably reduced when women in labor focused on the birth of the child as compared to when they focused on their pain. The results underscore the importance of utilizing separate measures of the sensory intensity versus the affective dimension of clinical pain and provide evidence that the affective dimension of different types of clinical pain is powerfully and differentially influenced by psychological contextual factors.\r"

Pain behavior was evaluated using a standard observation method and functional impairment was assessed using the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales. Data analysis revealed that pain and limitations in physical activities were the most common functional impairments and that the most frequently observed pain behavior was guarded movement. Predictive analyses indicated that disability support status and scores on a Pain Control and Rational Thinking factor of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) were predictive of functional impairment. Patients receiving disability support payments were much more functionally limited than those not receiving this financial support. Patients scoring high on the Pain Control and Rational Thinking factor of the CSQ were much less functionally impaired, walked a 5 m course more rapidly and moved from a standing to a sitting or reclining position more quickly than patients scoring low on this factor. The implications of these results for behavioral treatment of OA knee pain are discussed.\r"

Following the cognitive orientation theory, we hypothesized that beliefs concerning goals, norms, oneself, and general beliefs would predict the extent of improvement following acupuncture. Subjects were 30 Israeli chronic-pain patients (22 women, 8 men; mean age 41.6 years). They were administered a questionnaire assessing the 4 belief types, and control measures assessing personality traits, demographic variables, and pain characteristics. All underwent 4-6 acupuncture sessions. Improvement was determined by patient and physician ratings, and an index based on medication, subjective evaluations, and duration of resting. There were two follow-ups. Three improvement groups were defined: none (n = 8), slight (n = 12), and high (n = 10). These groups did not differ on any of the variables tested except the 4 belief types. A discriminant analysis with belief types as predictors enabled correct classification of the patients in 83% of the cases. A stepwise regression analysis showed that beliefs accounted for 85% of the variance. Discussion focuses on the nature of pain relief and the role of beliefs in disease.\r"

Control studies in barbiturate-anesthetized or spinal cord transected animals indicate that the dearth of WDR neurons was not just an artifact of the chronic recording technique. In those preparations WDR neurons represented 34% and 61% of the sample, respectively. Initial studies in which the effects of light barbiturate anesthesia on spinal dorsal horn neurons (n = 12) have been examined revealed that a 20 mg/kg dose of pentobarbital can, in some neurons (n = 4), unmask thermally evoked activity that was not present in the intact, drug-free animal. Responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were also enhanced following barbiturate administration. These changes resulted in a reclassification of neural type from low threshold in the intact, awake, drug-free animal to WDR in the anesthetized animal.\r"

The time-course and dose-response of associated inflammation and sensory abnormalities are described. Following intra-articular sodium urate rats reduce the weight placed on the paw of the treated hind limb and develop a limp in their gait. The ankle swells and becomes more sensitive to pressure and passive movements. Touch, pressure and thermal stimuli applied to the foot distal to the treatment produce decreased responses, presumably because active flexion movements are noxious. Joint pathology is reflected by tissue oedema and the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. However, there is no destruction or decrease in density of bone. It is proposed that this model of arthritis may have ethical and scientific advantages over adjuvant arthritis in the study of some aspects of the neural mechanisms of arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "Pain expression in neonates instigated by heel-lance for blood sampling purposes was systematically described using measures of facial expression and cry and compared across sleep/waking states and sex. From gate-control theory it was hypothesized that pain behavior would vary with the ongoing functional state of the infant, rather than solely reflecting tissue insult. Awake-alert but inactive infants responded with the most facial activity, consistent with current views that infants in this state are most receptive to environmental stimulation. Infants in quiet sleep showed the least facial reaction and the longest latency to cry. Fundamental frequency of cry was not related to sleep/waking state. This suggested that findings from the cry literature on qualities of pain cry as a reflection of nervous system 'stress', in unwell newborns, do not generalize directly to healthy infants as a function of state. Sex differences were apparent in speed of response, with boys showing shorter time to cry and to display facial action following heel-lance. The findings of facial action variation across sleep/waking state were interpreted as indicating that the biological and behavioral context of pain events affects behavioral expression, even at the earliest time developmentally, before the opportunity for learned response patterns occurs. Issues raised by the study include the importance of using measurement techniques which are independent of preconceived categories of affective response.\r"

Blood cultures were obtained in all; suprapubic or catheterized urine was obtained in 163 infants; CSF was collected successfully in 203 infants. Seventeen infants demonstrated positive blood cultures: 7 Streptococcus, 5 Staphylococcus, 3 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Bacillus subtilis and 1 diphtheroid infection. CSF obtained from 14 of those infants had normal examinations and sterile cultures. Factors associated with bacteremia were birth weight (P less than 0.01), gestational age (P less than 0.01), prolonged rupture of membranes (P less than 0.05) and leukopenia below 10 000/mm3 (P less than 0.05). In view of the negative CSF examinations in infants with positive blood cultures and the potential complications of lumbar puncture (hypoxia, trauma, infection, epidermoid tumor), the potential risks of CSF evaluation may exceed the assessed benefit for the infant with respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

Fevers have occurred, however, on Days 3 and 4 following vaccination. This study was conducted to determine whether febrile reactions could be eliminated and immunogenicity maintained by (1) giving smaller doses of vaccine or (2) vaccinating younger infants. Thirty-one children between 3 and 11 months of age received, in a randomized, double blind manner, either 10(4) PFU of vaccine virus, 10(3) PFU of vaccine virus or placebo. All recipients of the 10(4) PFU dose had a seroresponse; however, some degree of immunogenicity was lost with the smaller dose (10(3) PFU). Fevers were observed in recipients of both of the lowered doses of vaccine but the febrile reactions were related to the age of the vaccinee. No infant younger than 5 months of age experienced a temperature elevation, whereas the majority of children older than 5 months had fevers. Our data suggest that the lack of reaction in the younger infants correlates with the presence of prevaccination neutralizing antibody, presumably transplacentally acquired. We conclude that the rhesus rotavirus oral vaccine at a dose of 10(4) PFU is immunogenic and appears to be safe in young infants.\r"

Among children born in Sweden after April 1, 1975, tuberculosis occurred in 58 (57 unimmunized and one BCG-immunized), or 1.3 cases per 100,000 person years up to and including 1984. Eighteen of the 58 children were asymptomatic. Minor symptoms were reported in 13 and clinical illness in 27 children, 2 of whom developed meningitis and 1 of whom died of miliary infection. The relative increase of tuberculosis in the mainly unimmunized cohorts born in Sweden after April 1, 1975, compared with the mainly BCG-immunized cohorts born in Sweden in the period 1969 to 1974 was, by the end of 1984, estimated at 6.0 (95% confidence interval, 2.3, 16.1). Tuberculosis was about 10 times more common in non-BCG-immunized children born in Sweden of foreign parents than in those born of Swedish parents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine whether the use of continuous transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2) monitoring could reduce the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants receiving oxygen therapy. A total of 296 infants with birth weights less than or equal to 1,300 g were randomly assigned to a continuous monitoring or a standard care group. Infants in the continuous monitoring group had tcPO2 monitored continuously as long as they required supplemental oxygen, and infants in the standard care group had tcPO2 monitored only during the more acute state of their illness. Management of both groups was otherwise identical. Of 148 infants in the continuous monitoring group, 101 survived; of the 148 patients in the standard care group, 113 survived. Mean birth weights and gestational ages were similar for both groups. Duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy was also similar. The overall incidence of retinopathy of prematurity was 51% in the continuous monitoring group and 59% in the standard care group. As birth weight for infants greater than or equal to 1,000 g increased, a higher risk of retinopathy of prematurity developing was noted in the standard care group. Cicatricial retinopathy of prematurity developed in four infants in the continuous monitoring group and five in the standard care group. These results suggest that continuous tcPO2 monitoring may reduce the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity in infants with birth weights greater than 1,000 g but not in the smaller infants in whom this complication occurs more frequently and is more severe.\r"

  ".U": "87203219\r", 
  ".W": "In this prospective, longitudinal study, the relative impact of intracranial hemorrhage and prolonged mechanical ventilation on developmental progress during the first 18 months of life of infants weighing 1,200 g or less at birth was examined. A total of 159 surviving infants were divided into two groups: infants with and those without intracranial hemorrhage. These groups were then subdivided into groups of infants receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation (greater than 21 days) and those mechanically ventilated for 21 days or less, thus creating four subgroups. Group 1 (intracranial hemorrhage and prolonged mechanical ventilation) and group 3 (intracranial hemorrhage and no prolonged mechanical ventilation) showed no statistically significant differences for severity of intracranial hemorrhage, persistence of ventriculomegaly, or presence of periventricular leukomalacia. A repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated a main effect for prolonged mechanical ventilation on outcome as measured by the Bayley Mental Development Index and Bayley Psychomotor Development Index at 4, 8, 12, and 18 months of age (corrected for prematurity). Forward stepwise regression revealed prolonged mechanical ventilation to the best predictor of Bayley indexes at all ages except 4 months of age, for which the Psychomotor Development Index was best predicted by length of hospitalization. No main effect for intracranial hemorrhage was demonstrated, but the motor performance of infants with intracranial hemorrhage declined significantly with age. By contrast prolonged mechanical ventilation was associated with uniformly poor performance at every age and serves as a powerful marker for poor developmental progress during the first 18 months of life in infants weighing 1,200 g or less at birth.\r"

When the children were 3 years old, interviews with their mothers indicated that 3% had recurrent headaches and 9% had recurrent stomachaches. Children with recurrent stomachaches were more likely than those without recurrent stomachaches to have mothers who were emotionally depressed (P less than .01), had marital problems (P less than .05), and perceived their own health as poor (P less than .05). When maternal poor health was controlled, depression was still associated with their children having stomachaches (P less than .05). Prospectively collected data demonstrate that children with recurrent stomachaches did not have bowel difficulties when they were infants. Other psychosocial stresses and demographic factors were not associated with stomachaches. The only variable associated with recurrent headache was maternal depression. Children with recurrent headaches or stomachaches were more likely to have behavior problems, as measured by the Behavior Screening Questionnaire, than were children without these symptoms. The analysis presents new data on these common symptoms of childhood.\r"

Foods thought to be causing symptoms were evaluated by elimination of suspected foods, open challenges, and double-blind food challenges. Foods producing symptoms were reintroduced into the diet at 1- to 3-month intervals until the symptoms no longer occurred. Of the 480 children completing the study, 28% were thought to have symptoms produced during food ingestion, but in only 8% were these reactions reproduced (excluding fruit and fruit juices). During the first year of life 80% of the initial complaints occurred. The most striking finding was the brief duration during which reactions could be reproduced. The majority of foods were replaced in the diet within 9 months of their incrimination. A long list of foods was reported to produce many symptoms, but only a few foods reproducibly evoked gastrointestinal and skin symptoms, with respiratory symptoms being infrequent. Of great interest was that 75 children were reported to react to fruit or fruit juice, and 56 of these children had reproducible symptoms. This study has found that most food reactions occur during the first year of life, but rechallenge at regular intervals has shown that the food can be reintroduced into the diet by the third year without risk. Almost all reactions that were reproduced appear to be non-immunoglobulin E mediated.\r"

  ".W": "Since the 1970s, breast-feeding as the preferred method of infant feeding has increased in overall popularity. However, certain populations, particularly poor, young, black, and less-educated women, have been slow to adopt this method. This prospective study was undertaken to identify factors relating to the choice of infant-feeding method among inner-city adolescents. Two hundred fifty-four pregnant adolescents completed a questionnaire supplying information regarding attitudes toward and knowledge about breast-feeding, social support, personal experience, and other variables hypothesized to correlate with their choice of infant-feeding method. Of the total sample, 17% said they were \"probably\" or \"definitely\" going to breast-feed their babies. Analyses revealed adolescents most likely to intend to breast-feed were those who perceived more benefits to breast-feeding, who desired more knowledge about it, who were themselves breast-fed, who reported supportive social environments, and who perceived relatively fewer barriers to breast-feeding their infants. Specific interventions based upon these findings are proposed. We conclude that adolescent mothers are interested in breast-feeding their babies and that interventions are feasible to increase breast-feeding within this population.\r"

Magnetic resonance images are not histology specific, but with careful attention to the location of the abnormality, to the definition of the margins, and to the evaluation of involvement of adjacent muscle, bone, subcutaneous fat, and skin, the correct diagnosis can be strongly predicted in most cases. The ability of magnetic resonance to image in multiple planes aids in the evaluation of the extent of lesions and their relationship to adjacent structures. With magnetic resonance imaging, one can accurately predict the extent of abnormality, and there is great potential for the study of disease of soft tissues.\r"

Duration of postnatal weight loss was similar among all birth weight groups. Weight gain usually began between four and six days of age, and the rate of weight gain expressed as grams per kilogram per day was similar in all birth weight groups.\r"

Pediatric patients aged 2 years and less and pediatric intensive care unit patients received the greatest proportion of errant orders. Neonatal patients received the lowest rate of errant orders. The most common type of error was incorrect dosage, and the most prevalent type of error was overdosage. Antibiotics was the class of drugs for which errant orders were most common. Orders for theophylline, analgesics, and fluid and electrolytes, including hyperalimentation, were also frequently in error. In general, the error rate was greatest among physicians with the least training, but no physician group was error free. Involving pharmacists in reviewing drug orders significantly reduced the potential harm resulting from errant medication orders.\r"

The present investigation included neuromotor, cognitive, psychosocial, and medical evaluations of 67 hospitalized asthmatic children from 9 to 14 years of age, at risk for motor dysfunction. Mean scores from the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP) were similar to test norm means and were not indicative of neuromotor impairment. Scores of the BOTMP correlated significantly (P less than .01) with measures of child and family psychosocial adaptation but not with measures of cognitive ability, steroid dose at admission, or severity of asthma. Thirteen children had battery composite scores more than 1 SD below age means but did not demonstrate decreased IQ or increased steroid use, respiratory failure, seizures, or abnormal neurologic signs compared with the other 55 children. These results indicate that most severely asthmatic children, including many with histories of hypoxia and high-dose steroid use, do not demonstrate psychomotor impairments indicative of brain damage. It is concluded that neuromotor development in asthmatic children is associated with psychologic characteristics that influence adaptation to illness and activity level.\r"

One contained unmodified bovine milk protein (a ratio of whey proteins to caseins of 18:82); the other contained modified bovine milk protein (a ratio of whey proteins to caseins of 60:40). Both provided protein and energy intakes, respectively, of approximately 3.4 g/kg/d and 120 kcal/kg/d. Neither weight gain nor the rate of increase in length, head circumference, and skinfold thickness differed between the two groups. Nitrogen retention of the two groups also did not differ. Although BUN concentration and blood acid-base status did not differ, there were differences in the plasma concentrations of some amino acids. Plasma tyrosine concentration was higher in infants fed the casein-predominant protein, and plasma threonine concentration was higher in infants fed the whey-predominant protein. Neither plasma-free nor bound cyst(e)ine concentration differed between the two groups, but the greater cyst(e)ine intake of the whey-predominant group resulted in greater cyst(e)ine retention; this was accompanied by greater urinary taurine excretion, a reflection of greater taurine stores.\r"

Eight children with type I diabetes mellitus, hematuria, and hypercalciuria were observed in our clinic during a 1-year period. Two of these also had evidence of renal papillary necrosis. To assess the importance of hypercalciuria in the pathogenesis of hematuria in children with diabetes mellitus, we measured urinary calcium excretion in a large population of such patients. The calcium to creatinine ratio in the urine of diabetic children (0.21 +/- 0.01) was greater than that of nondiabetic children (0.12 +/- 0.01). A calcium to creatinine ratio of 0.28 was established as the upper limit of normal in our nondiabetic population, and 27% of the diabetic children were hypercalciuric on this basis. The diabetic children with hypercalciuria also had hyperphosphaturia and a urinary CaHPO4 X 2H2O molar ion product three times that found in the nondiabetic control population. These data suggest that many children with diabetes are at risk for renal damage due to hypercalciuria. Because hypercalciuria is more common in diabetic than nondiabetic children, it may play a previously unrecognized role in the renal disease associated with diabetes mellitus.\r"

Subsequently, the model was verified by using an independent set of available data on total insensible loss from naked infants who were not mechanically ventilated and who did not sweat. Under these conditions, the model was capable of correctly predicting the influence of ambient humidity, gestational age, and postnatal age, and in general, the predictions had a precision of +/- 14%, but they tended to underestimate insensible water loss by -16%. The straightforward algebraic form of the model makes it suitable for computerized calculations, which can be readily available at the bedside and quickly updated to account for changes in infant or environmental variables. The model is useful both for anticipating the abnormally large insensible water loss of the premature infant early in life and for computing expected changes in insensible water loss as a result of intentional manipulation of environmental factors, such as incubator temperature or supplemental humidification.\r"

The patient was a seven-day old premature, sick neonate in whom an aortic thrombosis developed following umbilical artery catheterization. Surgical thrombectomy could not be performed in this patient, and local thrombolytic therapy was not technically feasible. Systemic thrombolytic therapy failed to induce any noteable clinical or laboratory response, and the use of heparin failed to prevent thrombus extension. Experience with the use of fibrinolytic agents in neonates is limited. Local therapy has been variably effective, and systemic therapy has not been adequately investigated. The thrombotic phenomenon in neonates and the role of umbilical vessel catheterization as a cause are discussed in reference to this patient and suggestions are made regarding the management of similar cases.\r"

A prospective study was carried out in which 20 genital findings from three groups of girls (mean age 4.8 +/- 2.6 years) were analyzed. The three groups were (1) sexually abused girls (n = 119), (2) normal girls with no genital complaints (n = 127), and (3) girls with other genital complaints (n = 59). Group 1 was more likely than group 2 to have scars on the hymen or posterior forchette (9% v 1%, P = .002), increased friability of the posterior forchette (10% v 1%, P = .001), attenuated hymen (18% v 4%, P = .0003), and synechiae from the hymenal ring to the vagina (8% v 0%, P = .0009). Groups 1 and 3 were remarkably similar with the exception of erythema which was more common in group 3 (34% v 68%, P = .0001). Hymenal diameter was slightly greater in group 1 than 2 but not 3. Although genital findings distinguish some sexually abused girls from asymptomatic girls, many findings also occur in girls with other genital complaints, which suggests that many of these girls have also been molested or that vulvar inflammation may lead to some of these findings.\r"

Smoking is harmful to infants, children, and adolescents, and evidence is reviewed that passive smoking can have potent deleterious effects. Interventions with young adolescents based on social-psychologic theory have shown promise in changing smoking behavior and reducing smoking onset rates. Interventions are described, based on epidemiologic and etiologic data, that are appropriate for infants, children, adolescents, and parents. Interventions for parents should encourage cessation and the creation of a smoke-free environment for children. Interventions for children should emphasize the negative health effects of smoking and help them build an armamentarium against factors that promote experimentation with smoking. Interventions for adolescents should encourage them to remain nonsmokers in an environment of social pressure to smoke. The rationale for these strategies and methods of implementation in the pediatrician's office are described.\r"

Pediatricians need to be aware of whether these features of the \"athlete's heart\" occur in their patients, because such features may mimic those of cardiac disease. Fourteen prepubertal competitive male swimmers were evaluated by physical examination, ECG and echocardiogram, and findings were compared to those of a group of active but nontrained control boys. Lower resting heart rates and echocardiographic manifestations of chronic left ventricular volume overload were observed among the swimmers. These changes were not manifest on physical examination, however, and no significant ECG alterations were identified among the athletes. These findings indicate that, although features of the athlete's heart are present in children involved in endurance training, seldom will these findings simulate heart disease or be apparent on routine clinical examination.\r"

Much of the evidence associating chronic physical problems and mental health and adjustment problems has come from clinic-based studies and is often inconsistent in its conclusions. This paper reports the findings of the Ontario Child Health Study, an epidemiologic survey of 3,294 children 4 to 16 years of age in the general community, concerning the relationship of psychiatric disorders and social adjustment problems among children with chronic illness, medical conditions, and long-term disability in contrast to children free of chronic physical health problems. Age- and sex-adjusted risks for psychiatric disorders and social problems, compared with those for healthy peers, were calculated: children with both chronic illness and associated disability were at greater than threefold risk for psychiatric disorders and considerable risk for social adjustment problems. Children with chronic medical conditions, but no disability, were at considerably less risk: about a twofold increase in psychiatric disorders but little increased risk for social adjustment problems was observed. A relative underuse of specialized mental health services by children who might benefit supports the opinion that all physicians in the community who care for children with chronic health problems should become skilled in the recognition of existing or incipient mental health and social problems and familiar with preventive and treatment approaches that may lessen the excessive burden of psychosocial problems among those with chronic ill-health.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital cataracts and other ocular media opacities are a leading cause of preventable childhood blindness. Because of the importance of early recognition and treatment of congenital media opacities in newborn infants, we designed a study to determine the ability of relatively inexperienced examiners to detect such ocular abnormalities with either of two instruments. Eight third-year medical students examined eight children and young adults with ocular media opacities and eight age-matched normal subjects with an ophthalmoscope or a retinoscope. With respect to detection of abnormalities requiring referral to an ophthalmologist, there was an underreferral rate of 7% and overreferral rate of 5%. There was no significant difference between instruments. Based on an estimated incidence of congenital cataracts of 0.4%, the positive predictive value of this screening in the population of newborn infants is 18.7% and the negative predictive value is 99.96%. Therefore, overreferral is unavoidable in the effort to detect infants with congenital media opacities. We conclude that this examination can be easily taught and accurately performed with the readily available ophthalmoscope. The importance and technique of examining the red reflex should be stressed in the training of those caring for newborns.\r"

Results of a random-sample survey of 860 adolescents 16 to 19 years of age, in Massachusetts indicate that many adolescents are still misinformed or confused about AIDS and AIDS transmission. Of the adolescent respondents, 70% said they were sexually active (having sexual intercourse or other sexual contact) but only 15% of them reported changing their sexual behavior because of concern about contracting AIDS, and only 20% of those who changed their behavior used effective methods. Of both sexually active and nonactive adolescents, 8% did not know that AIDS is transmitted by heterosexual sexual intercourse. Psychoactive drugs other than alcohol and marijuana had been used by 13% of those responding, and 1% reported injecting drugs. Of those psychoactive drug users, 8% did not know that AIDS can be transmitted by injecting drugs. There was no significant difference in knowledge between the sexually active and nonactive adolescents concerning sexual behavior and AIDS transmission or between the drug users and nonusers concerning drug use and AIDS transmission. The majority of respondents knew a relationship exists between AIDS and blood, and other body fluids, but knowledge of the mode of transmission was limited. Hence, many adolescents, including those in the highest risk subgroups of sexually active or psychoactive drug users, did not know what sexual and drug precautions are needed to prevent transmission of the virus. School systems and health care providers should systematically educate this population about AIDS to counter the current misinformation and confusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Severe ischemia is indicated by paralysis, a late feature. Arterial embolism and acute thrombosis can be difficult to distinguish, and deep venous thrombosis may also be suspected in the differential diagnosis. To restore arterial flow, anticoagulation treatment with heparin (Lipo-Hepin, Liquaemin) is given and surgical embolectomy is performed. Heparin infusion is continued until the patient is ambulatory, and then warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin) is given over the long term. Fibrinolysis has also been used to treat acute arterial occlusion. Complications of embolism must be carefully guarded against, and additional procedures are sometimes necessary.\r"

Other congenital causes include lymphangiomas, cystic hygromas, dermoid cysts, and hemangiomas. Laryngoceles are acquired cysts that arise from an anatomic remnant, the laryngeal ventricle. Treatment for these neck masses is nearly always surgical removal.\r"

Reflex sympathetic dystrophy seems to be a common condition, but it is not widely understood and is probably underdiagnosed. It may be seen by primary care physicians as well as by specialists. Treatment is fairly simple. When pain with vasospasm is the presenting manifestation, use of a calcium channel blocker or prazosin (Minipress) in addition to physical therapy should be considered.\r"

Flexibility measures were correlated positively to one another; however, lumbosacral flexion measurements assessed by the modified Schober method correlated to the other flexibility measurements to a much lesser degree. Age, sex, and height affected ROM, as did obesity and the ratio of standing height to sitting height. The study findings indicate that spinal ROM covers a wide spectrum of values and is affected by many individual factors. Any attempts to determine what is normal, excessive, or diminished must take into account variations caused by age, sex, and other physical attributes.\r"

Thirty patients, with intracranial lesions and hemiplegia of 15 days' to 3 years' duration, were tested four times, consecutively. With the patients lying supine, the angle of flexion, at which the knee first reversed direction after the leg was dropped, was measured on each goniogram from the dynamometer chart recorder. The mean differences between the angles of reversal and the angles of maximum possible knee flexion (the relative angle of reversal) for the first through the fourth trials were 27.2, 27.0, 26.3, and 25.6 degrees, respectively. The relative angle of reversal did not differ significantly between trials. The mean difference between the largest and smallest relative angle of reversal for each of the subject's trials was 6.1 degrees. The intraclass correlation coefficient between the relative angle of reversal for the four trials was .96. Because the test variability was not significant and because the correlation between trials was high, the test may merit broader application to patients with intracranial lesions. Further investigation of variability across days and after treatments is advised.\r"

Patients were measured without controlling therapist goniometric placement technique or patient position during measurements. Repeated PROM measurements of shoulder flexion, extension, abduction, shoulder horizontal abduction, horizontal adduction, lateral (external) rotation, and medial (internal) rotation were taken of two groups of 50 subjects each. The intratester intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for all motions ranged from .87 to .99. The ICCs for the intertester reliability of PROM measurements of horizontal abduction, horizontal adduction, extension, and medial rotation ranged from .26 to .55. The intertester ICCs for PROM measurements of flexion, abduction, and lateral rotation ranged from .84 to .90. Goniometric PROM measurements for the shoulder appear to be highly reliable when taken by the same physical therapist, regardless of the size of the goniometer used. The degree of intertester reliability for these measurements appears to be range-of-motion specific.\r"

Three trials were recorded in each of the four positions. Data were analyzed by two-way analyses of variance for repeated measures. The results indicated that heart rate increased significantly from the sitting position to the bent-knee-inversion position (p less than .05). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (observed and corrected) and intraocular pressure (left and right) increased significantly from the sitting and standing positions to the bent-knee-inverted and straight-leg-inverted positions (p less than .01). Intraocular pressure also was significantly higher during straight leg inversion as compared with bent knee inversion (p less than .01).

An anatomical overview of the three components of the arch of the foot is presented, identifying the medial longitudinal arch as the arch mainly responsible for related structural problems throughout the lower limb. Deviations in the normal structure of the medial longitudinal arch produce unbalanced, functionally unstable conditions of the foot such as pes cavus or pes planus. Specific evaluation criteria for both pes cavus and pes planus are discussed, in addition to the adverse effects these two disorders have on weight bearing, force dissipation, and normal gait. Compensatory pronation associated with pes planus is one of the most common lower extremity disorders seen currently by physical therapists working in sports medicine, and its causes and related lower limb disorders are discussed. Most of these structural deformities can be corrected through the use of various orthotic devices. Specific guidelines are presented for using both soft and permanent orthoses, which offer the foot increased shock absorption and proper structural alignment.\r"

Data were collected by mail using a semantic differential test for measuring role perceptions and a questionnaire that included items related to job satisfaction and to demographic data. The return rate was 93%. At the time of data collection, the graduates had been employed for 12 to 18 months. The data on role perceptions were compared with data previously reported by Fincher Corb et al that had been collected on these same subjects when they entered the physical therapy education program and when they completed the program. Kendall's coefficient of concordance revealed significant differences (p less than .05) in three concepts relating to the professional role of the physical therapist and in one concept relating to self in that role. In each instance, the role perception score was lower after 12 to 18 months of employment. Job satisfaction scores were relatively high among the subjects. Spearman correlation coefficients calculated between job satisfaction and role perception scores revealed a positive and direct relationship between three role concepts and job satisfaction. Results of this study provide information about the professional socialization process in physical therapy.\r"

In our series, 80 percent (type I) of the major vascular pedicle arose from the thyrocervical trunk. In 20 percent (type II), the major pedicle arose separately from the subclavian artery. The regions perfused by the vascular trunk were further examined with microopaque and Prussian blue injections through the transverse cervical artery. Consistent areas of cutaneous staining as well as bony staining were noted over the shoulder, arm, and back and into the scapula itself. Experience with eight clinical applications of this osteomyocutaneous flap resulted in successful healing with an excellent aesthetic and functional result. Long-term follow-up was maintained on the patients for up to 36 months. Panorex radiographs and biopsies of the grafted bone were obtained on several patients. These disclosed evidence of bony remodeling and viable bone tissue. Tetracycline labeling also revealed evidence of active bony turnover.\r"

Techniques for sculpturing the masculine characteristics present in the foreheads of some females are discussed. The deformity has been divided into three subdivisions.

Palpebral fissure inclinations were recorded using anthropometric measurements preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Inclinations were reduced significantly by either technique; however, often the precise degree of the improvement was clear only from the measurements rather than from photographs. Complications of the transconjunctival approach were few, and there were no problems with wound healing and no ocular injury. Transconjunctival lateral canthopexy is a safe, effective method that avoids a potentially stigmatizing external scar.\r"

The indications for treatment have been stable anchorage of an external hearing aid or a facial episthesis, in the latter case to restore the facial contours after congenital disorders or status after trauma or cancer surgery. All implants have been inserted in a two-stage procedure, the first being anchorage of the titanium elements in the bone, the second, minimally 3 months later, being establishment of a permanent skin penetration. The outcome of every inserted implant has been analyzed. Only six implants failed to become integrated in bone and had to be removed. Five of these failures occurred in previously irradiated bone, where the success rate was estimated to 85.3 percent. In nonirradiated bone, 354 of 355 inserted implants became osseointegrated, i.e., anchored in bone in a stable manner. The soft tissues were without any adverse reactions in 92 percent of the 951 clinical observations, whereas potentially serious skin complications were observed in only 2.8 percent. Presently, the longest clinical follow-up is 8 years, and 37 implants have been followed for more than 5 years. We believe that this clinical material is the first in which an uneventful bone anchorage and skin penetration have been demonstrated in consecutively operated upon clinical cases. The implants used for anchoring an external hearing aid were also successful in the sense that the patients gained 15 dB (average) in hearing threshold and showed a significantly improved discrimination score. The implants inserted to hold facial epistheses resulted in considerably improved retention and a good cosmetic outcome for the patients.\r"

Since 1980, when suction lipectomy became the cornerstone of treatment, the results have been much better. As a result, current recommendations for treatment are as follows: If the gynecomastia is entirely due to fat, suction lipectomy alone is sufficient treatment. However, since suction will not remove breast parenchyma, those patients whose gynecomastia is due to parenchymal hypertrophy also require local excision of the parenchyma. Skin excision is rarely, if ever, necessary.\r"

This paper introduces the use of the laser for deepithelialization and illustrates its advantages in 44 consecutive patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty. Advantages are the precise removal of the upper dermis and epidermis--a true deepithelialization--with preservation of the lower dermis and pilosebaceous units. Associated decreased blood loss and more rapid operating time without an increase in complications makes this an attractive adjunctive technique with a wide variety of applications. No adverse effects or contraindications to the use of the CO2 laser for deepithelializing have been found.\r"

We employ an island whose long axis is directed toward the pressure sore, minimizing tension in wound closure. Skin overlying the greater trochanter is avoided. Previously undermined skin can be included in the flap. Fifty patients with ischial or sacral pressure sores have been managed by this technique. Superficial dehiscence occurred in 13 percent of patients, and deep dehiscence occurred in 10 percent. The dehiscence closed spontaneously in all but one patient. Forty-nine of the 50 patients experienced complete wound healing at the pressure sore site. The patients have been observed for an average of 20 months (range 3 to 38 months), with one recurrent pressure sore seen at 28 months postoperatively. The gluteus maximus musculocutaneous island flap has proven to be both reliable in healing and durable over the observed interval.\r"

The favorable results obtained by a preliminary study of subcutaneous implantation of amnion in our laboratory have led us to a prospective study to determine its value as a vascular graft. Tubed conduits of glutaraldehyde-treated amnion were hand constructed of varying diameters and lengths. They were employed as segmental interpositional grafts in experimentally created femoral and aortic arterial defects in Sprague-Dawley rats. Patency rates varied from 60 to 90 percent, with all grafts showing remarkable reendothelialization within 3 to 4 weeks postoperatively. Morphology, antigenic reaction, blood flow, and patency of the different experimental amnion grafts were evaluated and compared to appropriate controls.\r"

The free groin flap was used as a model in 27 white rabbits. The flap pedicle vessels were reclamped proximal to the anastomoses and areas of previous clamp application for periods of time varying between 30 minutes and 4 hours after 15 minutes of blood flow over these areas. A 100 percent patency rate was achieved despite the long periods of reclamping. Histologically, minor intimal damage was visible in the immediate period following anastomoses and clamping of the vessels. After 2 weeks, despite a thickened myofibroblastic intimal lesion, an intact endothelial layer was observed. No evidence of thrombosis could be demonstrated in either period. We postulate that vessels carefully treated and with technically well-performed anastomoses can be regarded as \"normal\" vessels after 15 minutes of blood flow over the anastomoses and clamp sites. We suggest that when required, microvascular clamps may then be reapplied without risk for prolonged periods of time despite static blood being in contact with these areas.\r"

The excellent correlation between diminished perception of vibration and increasing compartmental pressure suggested that 256 cycle per second (cps) vibratory stimuli may be useful clinically in determining the appropriate time for surgical intervention in the acute compartmental syndrome. In 12 adult male volunteers, elevated compartment pressures were created in the anterior tibial compartment of the leg. A decrease in perception to 256 cycle per second (cps) vibratory stimulus was the earliest sensory abnormality to occur with elevated tissue compartment pressures. Analysis of variance showed significantly that 256-cps vibration was the most reliable and earliest sensory modality to change at pressures of 35 to 40 mmHg. These clinical and experimental findings support the use of the 256-cps tuning fork as a noninvasive diagnostic test in the evaluation of the patient with suspected acute compartment syndrome.\r"

In the upper abdomen peritoneal reflections comprise 11 major ligaments and mesenteries. These are generally readily recognizable on computed tomographic scans by either their typical location and organ relationships or the landmarks provided by their major constituent vessels. These ligaments and mesenteries provide continuity of anatomic planes, which permits the spread of disease between intraperitoneal compartments, between extraperitoneal spaces, and between intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal localized sites.\r"

None of the nine patients with acute cholecystitis and false-negative angiograms had abscess or gangrene of the gallbladder. Use of radionuclide angiography may enable the prediction of the severity of acute cholecystitis, as nine of 25 patients with positive findings had either gangrenous cholecystitis or pericholecystic abscess.

A successful outcome was more likely if the interval between the last biliary tract surgery and balloon dilation exceeded 2 years. Stricture patency was more easily achieved in patients with primary ductal strictures than in those with biliary-enteric anastomotic strictures. Serious, procedure-related complications were encountered when strictures were dilated transhepatically; these included sepsis in 18 of 65 patients and bleeding due to arteriobiliary communications in seven. No serious complications occurred when strictures were dilated via a T tube track, making this the preferred route if available. Surgeons should be encouraged to leave T tubes in place if postoperative biliary stricture is suspected. Balloon dilation should be strongly considered in patients with benign postoperative strictures in whom surgical repair is difficult.\r"

Indications for splenectomy included trauma in eight patients, schistosomal (Bilharzial) portal hypertension in six, splenic artery aneurysm in one, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome in one. Studies were done within the 1st month and at various intervals up to 13 months after surgery. Implants in five of eight trauma patients were seen during the 1st month, and implants in seven of seven were seen after 6 months (one patient could not be followed up). Three of six implants in cases of portal hypertension were seen in the 1st month and four of four at 6 months (two patients were not followed up). In two of the five studies with denatured RBCs, Tc-99m tin colloid study was also done 48 hours later; in these cases denatured RBCs were more successful in showing the implants. The authors conclude that radioisotopic procedures are valuable in following up the viability of splenic implants. The \"take\" of splenic implants in patients with schistosomiasis is equally successful to that in trauma patients.\r"

Dogs were used as a model because of the similarities in the prostate between the two species and the ready availability of the canines. A retrograde transurethral approach was used for dilation. Balloon catheters, 8-20 mm in diameter, were used. Significant, long-lasting dilatation of the prostatic urethra was not accomplished until 20-mm balloons (or two 10-mm ones) inflated for 10 minutes were used. The animals were followed for up to 14 months. No deleterious histologic effects of dilation were identified within the urethra or prostate that could lead to stenosis of the prostatic urethra in later stages.\r"

The longest follow-up to date is 8 months. Patients were given topical anesthetics and mild sedatives, and dilation was performed with a 25-mm urethroplasty balloon catheter inflated at 3-6 atm for 10 minutes. All catheter manipulations were done with a guide wire and under fluoroscopic control. Significant resolution of symptoms of prostatism was seen in four patients. The unsatisfactory results in the last patient were believed to be caused by ineffectual dilation of predominantly middle lobe hypertrophy--a condition that is now regarded as a contraindication to dilation. This technique has promise to replace transurethral resection of the prostate as the treatment of choice for this common male ailment.\r"

Procedures related to nephrostomy tube placement included percutaneous nephrolithotripsy, tube changes, nephrostography, and stone fragment irrigations and retrievals. Staghorn calculi treatment with ESWL required the most procedures by radiologists (34% for partial staghorn and 56% for complete staghorn) compared with 3%, 8%, and 11% for calyceal, pelvic, and ureteral stones, respectively. In all, 8,478 radiologic examinations and procedures were performed pertaining to ESWL. This is approximately 35 studies per day. While this number may be high because it represents the early experience of the authors with ESWL, the impact on the radiology department can be substantial.\r"

Complications have been few so far and usually have been urinary obstructions or hemorrhages. Most fluid collections observed after ESWL are asymptomatic and their detection usually does not prolong hospitalization or alter therapy. In five patients out of 2,149 patient treatments symptomatic renal hematomas developed within a few hours after ESWL for renal calculi. In two of these patients the partial thromboplastin time was mildly prolonged. In four patients blood volume replacement was required to treat a falling hematocrit reading or hypotension. Diagnosis of the hematomas was initially made with sonography, although computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to further define the distribution and extent of retroperitoneal hematomas. Severe ipsilateral flank pain and rapid decrease in the hematocrit reading after ESWL strongly suggest significant bleeding from the treated kidney and require prompt radiologic confirmation and careful clinical treatment until there is evidence that the hemorrhage has stopped.\r"

However, film was more sensitive than digital images in the detection of abnormalities of the lung, including scar, interstitial lung disease, septal lines, and the presence of vascular catheters (P less than .05). These findings suggest that low-dose flying spot digital radiography of the chest, as performed with this specific prototype unit, is not adequate to replace film in the detection of abnormalities of the lung parenchyma.\r"

The presence of inferior wall and coronary artery disease was established with coronary angiography or from documentation of previous myocardial infarction. Supine and upright images were compared with use of receiver operating characteristic curves. In male patients diagnostic accuracy for identification of both inferior wall and coronary artery disease was improved through the use of the upright anterior image. In women, there was no significant difference in reader performance with upright and supine images. Upright anterior images should be routinely obtained in men in order to reduce the frequency of false-positive identification of inferior wall defects.\r"

The right ventricular volume index was 63 ml/m2 +/- 9 at end-diastole and 22 ml/m2 +/- 6 at end-systole. The left to right ventricular stroke volume ratio was 0.97 +/- 0.06, which was not statistically different from the theoretically expected ratio of 1. Interobserver and intraobserver measurements were closely correlated. Volume measurements were validated with two-dimensional echocardiography in five volunteers. Cine MR imaging allows reproducible three-dimensional measurement of right and left ventricular volumes with short imaging time and good temporal resolution.\r"

Numerous sequence combinations with varying repetition times (TR) and echo times (TE) were considered, and a triplet was selected consisting of long TR/long TE, short TR/short TE, and an opposed phase sequence with intermediate TR and TE. Correction to remove system-imposed intensity inhomogeneities was required for all images. Image standardization based on fat and pectoral muscle signals was necessary for intercase comparisons. Multispectral images obtained based on this analysis suggest the feasibility of intensity-based image classification.\r"

In most cases the accessory tissue was either bilateral or confined to the right side. When found on mammography, accessory axillary breast tissue should be recognized as a normal developmental variant rather than considered a pathologic lesion, although carcinoma can develop in the accessory tissue. A specific, radiography-aided diagnosis of accessory axillary breast tissue can eliminate unnecessary biopsy.\r"

Lateral cervical spine studies and computed tomography (CT) scans (21 patients) were analyzed.

Seven patients (26%) suffered initial neurologic sequelae in association with the C-2 injury. Nine patients had additional sites of fracture, including seven with associated C-1 ring disruption (26%). Extension of the fracture line into the transverse vertebral artery foramen led to vertebral artery injury and cerebellar embolization in one patient. Angiography may be necessary to detect intimal injury to the vertebral arteries when the fracture extends through the transverse foramina and to indicate the need for anticoagulation when clinically feasible.\r"

The mean ratio was 1.18 +/- 0.18 in patients with proved osteomyelitis, which was significantly higher (P less than .001) than that in patients with increased uptake resulting from soft-tissue infection (0.98 +/- 0.05). On the basis of a receiver operating characteristic curve, a ratio of 1.06 was selected as the cutoff for differentiating osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection. This method resulted in a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 92%, and an accuracy of 85%, and it appears to be more reliable than three- and four-phase scintigraphy, which are subjective and nonquantitative techniques.\r"

In this group, CT was superior to MR imaging for meniscus evaluation in 29.7% of the knees, equal to MR in 54.7%, and inferior to MR in 15.6%. Although surface-coil MR imaging shows great promise and has numerous advantages over more conventional techniques, this preliminary experience suggests that, at least with certain imaging equipment and techniques, CT may be slightly more efficacious than 0.5-T MR imaging in meniscus evaluation. However, further comparative studies at higher field strengths are needed before the relative roles of CT and MR imaging can be established.\r"

  ".W": "Volumetric rendering is a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) imaging that overcomes many of the drawbacks of currently available surface-rendering systems. Its application on the Pixar Imaging System in two cases of acetabular fracture was assessed to illustrate the features of the technique. The fast-computing architecture and large memory of this system allow rapid generation of a series of high-quality 3D images in each plane of rotation (x or spinal axis, z or somersaulting axis) that can be viewed as independent static images or as an animated real-time video loop. Editing to remove the normal contralateral hemipelvis enhances appreciation of acetabular abnormalities. Every pixel of computed tomographic data is preserved, allowing representation of both soft tissue and bone as translucent overlap. The presentation of data also allows detection of subtle abnormalities and features and minimizes the artifact generation common in surface-rendered images.\r"

Eighteen stents, 1 cm in length and 4 or 5 mm in diameter when fully expanded, were placed in atherosclerotic stenotic lesions in six rabbits. Luminal distention was consistently achieved. At 8 weeks follow-up, no luminal narrowing, stent migration, thrombus formation or branch vessel occlusion had occurred. Atherosclerotic neointimal proliferation occurred around the stent wires following placement, but did not cause significant luminal narrowing.\r"

The hospital mortality and amputation rate were 1.6% and 1.95%, respectively. The average age of the patients was 69.1 years and more than half of those treated had stage III or IV disease. A 6-year experience with local low-dose thrombolytic therapy has completely confirmed its efficacy and has led to improvements in technique, which are described. The doses of streptokinase and urokinase needed for a successful result have been substantially reduced and the duration of treatment shortened. The number of complications has also been reduced. Differential therapeutic considerations compared to vascular surgery are mentioned. The results should motivate a reconsideration of the diagnostic and therapeutic measures to be used in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusions.\r"

Meticulous radiographic delineation of the small structures in this region, coupled with endoscopic evaluation, provides detailed preoperative information regarding morphology and pathology. This information has led to more focused endoscopic surgical procedures, which have dramatically reduced patient morbidity. As a consequence, there is now worldwide interest among otolaryngologists in the radiologic definition of paranasal regional anatomy. For effective interactions between radiologist and otolaryngologist, the former must be prepared to render interpretations that address these \"microanatomic\" locales. This communication is directed at familiarizing the radiologist with these observations and concepts, considering both normal and disturbed anatomy with their attendant pathophysiologic and therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".W": "With the use of conventional spin-echo pulse sequences with a long repetition time (TR), the echo time (TE) and the number of echoes were varied to minimize cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow artifacts in a spine phantom and in cervical spines of three volunteers. The following echo trains were compared in both axial and sagittal planes with a TR of 2,000 msec: TE of 25, 80 msec (\"asymmetric\"); TE of 40, 80 msec (\"symmetric long TE\"); and TE of 20, 40, 60, and 80 msec (\"symmetric short TE\"). Variable degrees of even-echo rephasing of CSF flow artifacts were observed during sagittal but not axial imaging, depending on the echo train used. Even-echo rephasing was most complete with the symmetric short-TE echo train, less complete with the symmetric long-TE echo train, and absent with the asymmetric echo train. Switching the orientation of the phase and frequency encoding gradients and slightly modifying TR on the basis of the heart rate further improved image quality. The results suggest that a symmetric short-TE echo train may be used to provide velocity compensation (similar to that observed with rephasing gradients) on even echoes of conventional spin-echo pulse sequences during spine imaging.\r"

Peripheral gating was performed with either an infrared reflectance photoplethysmograph or peripheral arterial Doppler signal. The effects of effective repetition time, echo train, trigger delay, number of sections, and imaging plane on image quality were evaluated. Gated imaging of oscillatory CSF motion simulated constant-velocity flow and reduced CSF flow artifacts caused by cardiac-dependent temporal phase-shift effects. Velocity compensation on sagittal even-echo images with a symmetric short-echo time echo train reduced the remaining CSF flow artifacts caused by spatial phase-shift effects. Overall gated imaging time was not increased compared with nongated imaging and was reduced when improved image quality permitted the use of fewer excitations. These results suggest that the combination of CSF gating and flow compensation is clinically useful and efficient because it improves image quality without prolonging imaging time.\r"

Alternate theories postulating that a possible movement of the brain is involved in pumping CSF have not, to the authors' knowledge, been substantiated heretofore. In this study, in vivo, quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods were developed to show reproducible magnitudes and directions of CSF flow. Measurements were obtained with a new MR velocity imaging technique at high resolution (0.4 mm/sec), requiring 64 cardiac cycles per image. Twenty-five healthy volunteers and five patients were studied. Observations of pulsatile brain motion, ejection of CSF out of the cerebral ventricles, and simultaneous reversal of CSF flow direction in the basal cisterns toward the spinal canal, taken together, suggest that a vascular-driven movement of the entire brain may be directly pumping the CSF circulation. The authors describe what they believe to be the first observations and measurements of human brain motion, which occurs in extensive internal regions (particularly the diencephalon and brain stem) and is synchronous with cardiac systole.\r"

Tinnitus, ear pulsations, and diminished hearing were the most frequent symptoms. No patient had a second chemodectoma, and none of seven patients who were tested had elevated neuroendocrine compounds. Review of the radiographic examinations showed that direct coronal, thin-section computed tomography (CT) was the most sensitive means of demonstrating glomus tympanicum chemodectomas. Magnification angiography was also a sensitive diagnostic study, typically depicting a trapezoidal, hypervascular, middle-ear mass that appeared initially in the middle-to-late arterial phase and quickly disappeared in the venous phase. Differentiation from an aberrant internal carotid artery is critical to prevent arterial biopsy.\r"

Concomitant boost technique was used to reduce the overall duration of treatment from 7 to 5 weeks while maintaining the standard 70-Gy tumor dose. The first part of treatment consisted of conventional cobalt irradiation, 50 Gy delivered to the whole neck over 5 weeks. The accelerated schedule, carried out over 4 weeks, delivered an additional 1 Gy/day to the node through a circular and lateral electron beam field, for a total dose of 70 Gy to the enlarged node. In the case of an identified primary the tumor site was also boosted to the 70-Gy total dose. The rate of acute skin reactions was acceptable and there were no major mucosal complications. At the end of irradiation, 62% of patients experienced complete clinical regression; 41% subsequently had cervical recurrences. Early cervical fibrosis was limited to the over-treated area. The concomitant boost technique is a good way to accelerate irradiation without decreasing the total dose or increasing the immediate complication rate.\r"

The majority of proteins exhibit phosphorescence under normal solution conditions. Phosphorescence lifetimes from 0.5 millisecond to 2 seconds were observed in three-fourths of the proteins tested. The lifetime appears to correlate with relative isolation of the tryptophan indole side chain from solvent. With few exceptions, proteins in general can be expected to display a phosphorescence lifetime greater than 30 microseconds. This widespread characteristic of proteins has been largely overlooked because long-lived phosphorescence is highly sensitive to quenching by low levels of dissolved oxygen in solution. Protein phosphorescence offers a new time domain and a far wider dynamic range than has been used before for photoluminescence experimentation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms underlying the ontogeny of voltage-gated ion channels in muscle are unknown. Whether expression of voltage-gated channels is dependent on mitogen withdrawal and growth arrest, as is generally true for the induction of muscle-specific gene products, was investigated in the BC3H1 muscle cell line by patch-clamp techniques. Differentiated BC3H1 myocytes expressed functional Ca2+ and Na+ channels that correspond to those found in T tubules of skeletal muscle. However, Ca2+ and Na+ channels were first detected after about 5 days of mitogen withdrawal. In order to test whether cellular oncogenes, as surrogates for exogenous growth factors, could prevent the expression of ion channels whose induction was contingent on mitogen withdrawal, BC3H1 cells were modified by stable transfection with oncogene expression vectors. Expression vectors containing v-erbB, or c-myc under the control of the SV40 promoter, delayed but did not prevent the appearance of functional Ca2+ and Na+ channels. In contrast, transfection with a Val12 c-H-ras vector, or cotransfection of c-myc together with v-erbB, suppressed the formation of functional Ca2+ and Na+ channels for greater than or equal to 4 weeks. Potassium channels were affected neither by mitogenic medium nor by transfected oncogenes. Thus, the selective effects of certain oncogenes on ion channel induction corresponded to the suppressive effects of mitogenic medium.\r"

However, little is known about the relevant glycoproteins or how these transformation-related changes in oligosaccharide biosynthesis may affect the malignant phenotype. Here it is reported that a cell surface glycoprotein, gp 130, is a major target of increased beta 1-6-linked branching and that the expression of these oligosaccharide structures is directly related to the metastatic potential of the cells. Glycosylation mutants of a metastatic tumor cell line were selected that are deficient in both beta 1-6 GlcNAc transferase V activity and metastatic potential in situ. Moreover, induction of increased beta 1-6 branching in clones of a nonmetastatic murine mammary carcinoma correlated strongly with acquisition of metastatic potential. The results indicate that increased beta 1-6-linked branching of complex-type oligosaccharides on gp 130 may be an important feature of tumor progression related to increased metastatic potential.\r"

When the calcium ion concentration was lowered from 10 to 0 millimolar (that is, no added calcium), potassium channel activity, identified from its characteristic time course, disappeared within a few seconds and there was a parallel increase in resting membrane conductance and in the holding current. The close temporal correlation of the changes in the three parameters suggests that potassium channels lose their ability to close in the absence of calcium and simultaneously lose their selectivity. If potassium channels were blocked by barium ion before calcium ion was removed, the increases in membrane conductance and holding current were delayed or prevented. Thus calcium is an essential cofactor in the gating of potassium channels in squid neurons.\r"

  ".W": "There is abundant geographic variation in both morphology and gene frequency in most species. The extent of geographic variation results from a balance of forces tending to produce local genetic differentiation and forces tending to produce genetic homogeneity. Mutation, genetic drift due to finite population size, and natural selection favoring adaptations to local environmental conditions will all lead to the genetic differentiation of local populations, and the movement of gametes, individuals, and even entire populations--collectively called gene flow--will oppose that differentiation. Gene flow may either constrain evolution by preventing adaptation to local conditions or promote evolution by spreading new genes and combinations of genes throughout a species' range. Several methods are available for estimating the amount of gene flow. Direct methods monitor ongoing gene flow, and indirect methods use spatial distributions of gene frequencies to infer past gene flow. Applications of these methods show that species differ widely in the gene flow that they experience. Of particular interest are those species for which direct methods indicate little current gene flow but indirect methods indicate much higher levels of gene flow in the recent past. Such species probably have undergone large-scale demographic changes relatively frequently.\r"

  ".W": "The neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, appears on early embryonic cells and is important in the formation of cell collectives and their boundaries at sites of morphogenesis. Later in development it is found on various differentiated tissues and is a major CAM mediating adhesion among neurons and between neurons and muscle. To provide a molecular basis for understanding N-CAM function, the complete amino acid sequences of the three major polypeptides of N-CAM and most of the noncoding sequences of their messenger RNA's were determined from the analysis of complementary DNA clones and were verified by amino acid sequences of selected CNBr fragments and proteolytic fragments. The extracellular region of each N-CAM polypeptide includes five contiguous segments that are homologous in sequence to each other and to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, suggesting that interactions among immunoglobulin-like domains form the basis for N-CAM homophilic binding. Although different in their membrane-associated and cytoplasmic domains, the amino acid sequences of the three polypeptides appear to be identical throughout this extracellular region (682 amino acids) where the binding site is located. Variations in N-CAM activity thus do not occur by changes in the amino acid sequence that alter the specificity of binding. Instead, regulation is achieved by cell surface modulation events that alter N-CAM affinity, prevalence, mobility, and distribution on the surface. A major mechanism for modulation is alternative RNA splicing resulting in N-CAM's with different cytoplasmic domains that differentially interact with the cell membrane. Such regulatory mechanisms may link N-CAM binding function with other primary cellular processes during the embryonic development of pattern.\r"

The resulting three-dimensional model shows at least four projecting arms, arranged radially near the presumed interface with the 30S subunit. The projecting arms are positioned around a cleft, which turns into a tunnel with a length of 100 to 120 angstroms and a diameter of up to 25 angstroms.

The projections from auditory centers to the frontal cortex of the bat Pteronotus parnellii were examined because echolocating bats utilize auditory cues to guide their movements in space. An area in the frontal cortex receives a direct projection from a division of the auditory thalamus, the suprageniculate nucleus, which in turn receives input from the anterolateral peri-olivary nucleus, an auditory center in the medulla. This pathway to the frontal cortex bypasses the main auditory centers in the midbrain and cortex and could involve as few as four neurons between the cochlea and the frontal cortex. The auditory cortex is also a major source of input to the frontal cortex. This area of the frontal cortex may link the auditory and motor systems by its projections to the superior colliculus.\r"

  ".U": "87206203\r", 
  ".W": "A fundamental feature of the mammalian visual system is the nonuniform distribution of ganglion cells across the retinal surface. To understand the ontogenetic processes leading to the formation of retinal ganglion cell topography, changes in the regional density of these neurons were studied in relation to ganglion cell loss and the pattern of retinal growth in the fetal cat. Midway through the gestation period, the density of these neurons was only two to three times greater in the area centralis than in the peripheral retina, whereas shortly before birth this central-to-peripheral difference was nearly 20-fold. Age-related changes in the ganglion cell distribution were found not to correspond in time or magnitude to the massive loss of ganglion cells that occurs during prenatal development. Rather, the formation of ganglion cell density gradients can be accounted for by unequal expansion of the growing fetal retina-peripheral regions expand more than the central region, thereby diluting the peripheral density of ganglion cells to a greater degree. Nonuniform growth, in conjunction with differential periods of neurogenesis of the different types of retinal cells, appears to be a dominant factor regulating overall retinal topography. These results suggest that the differential regional expansion of the fetal retina underlies the formation of magnification factors in the developing visual system.\r"

Although this hypothesis has gained some acceptance, it has also been criticized because the use of only one cell lineage tracer was not a conclusive test of the hypothesis. However, the critical experiment, an assessment of the extent of mingling between two labeled clones in the same embryo, has now been performed. A model of the proposed arrangement of the ancestral cell groups in the 512-cell embryo predicted that the two clones would remain separate in 49% of cases and intermingle in 51% of cases. In fact, there was a bimodal distribution, in which separation of the clones occurred in 46% of embryos and extensive interclonal mingling was observed in 54%. These results are not compatible with hypotheses in which a unimodal distribution of mingling would be predicted but are consistent with the compartment hypothesis.\r"

Some observers argue that the American middle class is vanishing, but U.S. census income statistics show income inequality has not changed appreciably since 1947. A second controversy involves whether average living standards have risen or fallen since the major oil price increase of 1973-74. These controversies can be partially resolved by understanding the sharp slowdown in the growth of workers' wages which occurred after 1973 and the demographic trends which kept per capita living standards rising despite stagnant wages, including more working women and low birthrates.\r"

A mutant strain that is hypersensitive to the widely used anesthetic halothane was described earlier. The mutation is now shown to be an allele of unc-79. Other alleles of unc-79 are also associated with hypersensitivity to halothane. A strain with a mutation in a second gene, unc-80, is also hypersensitive to halothane. Nematodes bearing mutations in both unc-79 and unc-80 are slightly more sensitive to halothane than those bearing only one of these mutations. Mutations in a third gene, unc-9, suppress both unc-79 and unc-80. Nematodes bearing the suppressor mutations alone have normal sensitivity to halothane. These results show that sensitivity to halothane can be altered by mutations in several different genes.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages that rapidly enter injured peripheral nerve synthesize and secrete large quantities of apolipoprotein E. This protein may be involved in the redistribution of lipid, including cholesterol released during degeneration, to the regenerating axons. To test this postulate, apolipoprotein E-associated lipid particles released from segments of injured rat sciatic nerve and apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins from plasma were used to determine whether sprouting neurites, specifically their growth cones, possessed lipoprotein receptors. Pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, which can be stimulated to produce neurites in vitro, were used as a model system. Apolipoprotein E-containing lipid particles and lipoproteins, which had been labeled with fluorescent dye, were internalized by the neurites and their growth cones; the unmetabolized dye appeared to be localized to the lysosomes. The rapid rate of accumulation in the growth cones precludes the possibility of orthograde transport of the fluorescent particles from the PC12 cell bodies. Thus, receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake is performed by the apolipoprotein B,E(LDL) (low density lipoprotein) receptors, and in the regenerating peripheral nerve apolipoprotein E may deliver lipids to the neurites and their growth cones for membrane biosynthesis.\r"

Whether these two chromatin fractions are sequence-specific subsets of the spermatozoon genome is the question addressed in this report. Sequence-specific packaging would suggest distinct structural and functional roles for the nucleohistone and nucleoprotamine in late spermatogenesis or early development or both. After removal of histones with 0.65M NaCl, exposed DNA was cleaved with Bam HI restriction endonuclease and separated by centrifugation from insoluble nucleoprotamine. The DNA sequence distribution of nucleohistone DNA in the supernatant and nucleoprotamine DNA in the pellet was compared by cloning size-selected single-copy sequences and by using the derived clones as probes of nucleohistone DNA and nucleoprotamine DNA. Two clones derived from nucleohistone DNA preferentially hybridized to nucleohistone DNA, and two clones derived from nucleoprotamine DNA preferentially hybridized to nucleoprotamine DNA, which demonstrated the existence of sequence-specific nucleohistone and nucleoprotamine components within the human spermatozoon.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical coupling and dye coupling between pairs of rat hepatocytes were reversibly reduced by brief exposure to halogenated methanes (CBrCl3, CCl4, and CHCl3). The potency of different halomethanes in uncoupling hepatocytes was comparable to their hepatotoxicity in vivo, and the rank order was the same as that of their tendency to form free radicals. The effect of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) on hepatocytes was substantially reduced by prior treatment with SKF 525A, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450, and by exposure to the reducing reagent beta-mercaptoethanol. Halomethane uncoupling occurred with or without extracellular calcium and did not change intracellular concentrations of calcium and hydrogen ions or the phosphorylation state of the main gap-junctional protein. Thus the uncoupling appears to depend on cytochrome P-450 oxidative metabolism in which free radicals are generated and may result from oxidation of the gap-junctional protein or of a regulatory molecule that leads to closure of gap-junctional channels. Decreases in junctional conductance may be a rapid cellular response to injury that protects healthy cells by uncoupling them from unhealthy ones.\r"

  ".W": "The role of myosin in the contraction of striated muscle cells is well known, but its importance in nonmuscle cells is not yet clear. The function of myosin in Dictyostelium discoideum has been investigated by isolating cells which specifically lack myosin heavy chain (MHC A) protein. Cells were transformed with a vector encoding RNA complementary to mhcA messenger RNA (antisense RNA). Stable transformants have a dramatic reduction in the amount of MHC A protein, grow slowly, and generate giant multinucleated progeny, indicating an impairment in cytokinesis. Surprisingly, the cells adhere to surfaces, extend pseudopods and are capable of ameboid locomotion. The developmental sequence that is initiated by starving cells is severely impaired by the lack of myosin. The cells are unable to form multicellular aggregates normally and do not undergo subsequent morphogenesis. By changing the food source from liquid medium to bacteria, expression of the endogenous mhcA messenger RNA can be increased relative to expression of antisense RNA. When grown in this way, the transformed cells accumulate MHC A protein, remain mononucleate, and proceed through development normally.\r"

  ".W": "The phenomenon of homologous recombination, which allows specific gene conversion and gene insertion, can be a powerful system for the study of eukaryotic cell biology. Data are presented demonstrating that integration of a transfected plasmid by homologous recombination occurs in the motile eukaryotic cell Dictyostelium discoideum. A plasmid carrying a G418 resistance gene and the amino terminal half of the myosin heavy chain gene was used to transfect Dictyostelium. A large fraction of the resultant G418-resistant cells had the plasmid integrated into the single genomic copy of the heavy chain gene. These cells, which fail to express the native myosin but express the myosin fragment, are defective in cytokinesis and become large and multinucleate. In spite of the absence of native myosin, these cells, termed hmm cells, exhibit many forms of cell movement, including membrane ruffling, phagocytosis, and chemotaxis. The hmm cells can aggregate but are blocked at a later stage in the Dictyostelium developmental cycle. The hmm cells revert to the wild-type phenotype. Reversion of the hmm phenotype is due to excision and loss of the transforming plasmid. The revertant cells express native myosin, are G418 sensitive, and have a normal developmental cycle. These results constitute genetic proof that the intact myosin molecule is required for cytokinesis and not for karyokinesis.\r"

The myotube currents have a faster and more voltage-dependent macroscopic inactivation rate, a larger steady-state component, and a less negative steady-state inactivation curve than the neuronal currents. The myotube channels have a conductance of 12 to 16 picosiemens, whereas the neuronal channels have a conductance of 5 to 8 picosiemens. In addition, the myotube channel is affected by Shaker mutations, whereas the neuronal channel is not. Together, these data suggest that the two channels are separate molecular structures, the expression of which is controlled, at least in part, by different genes.\r"

Embryonic motor neurons from chick ciliary ganglion attached to both surfaces but grew extensive neurites only on the basement membrane. On cross sections of rolled amnion membranes, regenerating axons of cultured neurons were guided along pathways of basement membrane that were immunoreactive with an antibody to laminin. In addition, when rolled amnion membranes were implanted into a lesion cavity between the rat septum and hippocampus, cholinergic neurons extended axons through the longitudinally oriented implant into the hippocampus. Thus, this amnion preparation can serve as a bridge to promote axonal regeneration in vivo in damaged adult brain.\r"

Both enzymes showed typical characteristics of protein kinase C that responded to Ca2+, phospholipid, and diacylglycerol. The enzymes showed practically identical physical and kinetic properties and were indistinguishable from one of the several subspecies of protein kinase C that occurs in rat brain but not in untransfected COS 7 cells.

Expression of the mdr gene also reached high levels in regenerating rat liver 24 to 72 hours after partial hepatectomy.

Until recently, trauma care in the United States was delivered in a nonorganized, nonintegrated fashion, with trauma victims being transported to the medical facility closest to the scene of the accident. Many recent studies confirm an unacceptably high incidence--up to 75% in some studies--of preventable deaths in trauma victims treated under the nearest hospital system. This has resulted in the development of specialized trauma centers. The concept of a regional trauma center requires restrictive medical practice in which a limited number of hospitals and physicians provide care for those 5% to 12% of patients who are critically injured. The decision on whether to take a patient to the closest hospital or to the regional trauma center is a form of triage, with far-reaching consequences medically, ethically, and financially. Various triage instruments have been developed to try to identify those patients who would benefit from the resources of a trauma center, and to avoid overcrowding those centers with patients having less serious injuries. These triage tools are based on a combination of mechanism of injury, anatomic criteria, physiologic criteria, and co-morbidity factors.\r"

The hypercalcemia developed three to eight weeks after the patients were admitted to the hospital, when clinical improvement due to specific drug therapy for the infection was also evident. The abnormality persisted for three to seven weeks and subsided spontaneously. In each case, the serum level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D determined during the period of hypercalcemia (at the peak in three of the four cases) was low. This suggests that altered vitamin D metabolism is not the basis for hypercalcemia in all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis.\r"

A review of the eight-year trends in the pregnancy outcomes of teenaged mothers (less than 18 years old) indicated a significant decline (P less than .05) in the percentage of total South Carolina live infants born to teenaged mothers. While a significant increase in the teenage abortion ratio was detected, the proportion of total South Carolina pregnancies (estimated by the summation of live births, fetal deaths, and induced abortions) among teenagers significantly decreased. Compared to mothers 18 to 34 years old, teenaged mothers were nearly twice as likely to deliver prematurely, while one half as likely to receive adequate prenatal care. Their offspring were at increased risk of low birth weight and had increased fetal and infant death rates. Thirty percent of pregnancies in teenaged mothers were terminated by induced abortion, and 22% of the teenage pregnancies were to mothers aged 15 or younger, emphasizing the importance of not delaying discussions with teens of the issues of adolescent sexuality and contraception.\r"

The most important signs are an infant small for gestational age, with wrinkled skin, Potter facies, compression deformities of the limbs, and respiratory distress caused by pulmonary hypoplasia. The recurrence rate of kidney conditions implicated in OS depends on the severity of the condition in the previously affected sib. While absent or encysted kidneys (Potter types II and IV) are incompatible with life, chronic leakage of amniotic fluid may result in a viable infant who shows some signs of OS. The usual incidence of absent or encysted kidneys is 1 per 6,250 births. This rate was exceeded recently in northeastern Tennessee, in a clustering of cases for which no environmental causes are evident.\r"

This proves that the furcal nerve is an independent nerve root. Neurologic symptoms, suggestive of two roots being involved, are frequently due to furcal nerve compression.\r"

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and temperature remain normal. Radiologically, a distinct form of progressing osteolysis is present. This entity may present a difficult diagnostic problem and is usually diagnosed erroneously as a destructive osteomyelitis. Craig needle biopsy results are normal. Treatment consists of stabilization rather than antibiotic therapy and debridement. It is apparent that patients with spinal instability are to be considered \"at risk\" as further decompression may accelerate the instability, resulting in progressive osteolysis.\r"

Thirty-one (31%) had never had low-back pain; 44 (44%) had or were having mild low-back pain; and 24 (24%) had or were having severe low-back pain. Three chiropractors assessed 56 radiographic variables, which included determinations of disc space height, vertebral malalignments and subluxations, spondylosis, postural disturbances, relationships among pelvis and spine and other congenital or acquired abnormalities. Interobserver reliability measurements showed that 6 of the 56 variables analyzed produced a high interobserver reliability. Sixteen additional variables showed a fair interobserver reliability. Comparison of the observations made by the chiropractors and a radiologist showed minimal agreement except for disc space height assessments at L3-4 and L4-5. Few of the radiographic variables discriminated between the current or prior history of low-back and leg complaints, although a few variables (most notably disc space narrowing) were statistically associated with back or leg complaints (P = .025). The conclusion was reached that spinal radiographs, whether analyzed by measurements, by a radiologist, or by chiropractors, have minimal value in determining the presence or absence of low-back complaints and, in particular, have no value in epidemiologic studies.\r"

Commercially available stainless steel (control) pins and newly designed stainless steel experimental pins were evaluated. Cyclic loading tests and load-to-failure tests were performed. Of the many designs tested, one pin demonstrated an improvement in structural properties at the pin-bone interface compared with the control pin. Furthermore, the new pin design was more resistant to insertional torque reduction when subjected to cyclic loading after insertions at 4 and 6 in-lb. Both the control and experimental pins exhibited improved structural behavior at 8 in-lb of insertional torque compared to the currently recommended 6 in-lb.\r"

Bone union was confirmed during a mean postoperative period of 2 years and 2 months in seven patients by the disappearance of clear zones observed preoperatively in the disc space, and by continuity of the trabeculae in radiograms. One of the two patients in whom the procedure failed to unite the site of nonunion had received technically inadequate wiring with slight mobility at the wiring site; in the other patient, the grafted bone had collapsed and no sclerotic shadow of the nonunion site was seen at the time of surgery. Both patients underwent wiring after considerable intervals from the time of the initial anterior spinal fusion. We found that satisfactory bone union can be obtained for nonunion or delayed union following anterior cervical spinal fusion by interspinous wiring without further bone grafting if applied to properly selected patients.\r"

Nondestructive tests were performed in which the transverse deflection was recorded at various axial load levels. Southwell regression was used on the data to estimate the buckling loads. Attaching L-rods of 3.2-mm diameter did not increase the buckling load significantly, compared to the uninstrumented spine and thus were judged to be ineffective in halting the progression of a scoliotic curve. However, L-rods of 4.8-mm diameter increased the buckling load about four times and L-rods of 6.4 mm increased the buckling load about eight times.\r"

If reduction is obtained, then nonoperative treatment in the form of a halo thoracic apparatus may be the best method of treatment. Failure to obtain reduction with axial traction is an indication for open reduction and one-level posterior cervical fusion. Patients left in the displaced position and allowed to heal in that position usually develop late pain as a complication of this method of treatment.\r"

Twelve patients with myelomeningocele kyphosis, measuring an average of 124 degrees, were managed by posterior kyphectomy and segmental spinal instrumentation. After operation, the curves measured an average of 32.8 degrees. With a follow-up period, 6-57 months, only one patient lost correction. The loss of correction was secondary to rod failure. Straight midline incision, ignoring previous incisions, can be used to approach the spine without risk of increased wound complications. Adequate immediate stable correction can be achieved by kyphectomy and segmental spinal instrumentation with anterior fixation to the pelvis that thus allows the patient to proceed more quickly to an improved functional level.\r"

The annulus fibrosus could be divided into an inner and outer region. The main cell components of the annulus fibrosus were fibroblast-like cells in the outer region and chondrocytes in the inner region. The nucleus pulposus consisted of massively packed notochordal cells. The cartilage plates could also be divided into two zones: articular cartilage and growth cartilage containing chondrocytes. Postmortem degenerative changes proceeded from the peripheral to the central parts of the intervertebral disc, ie, showing degeneration of first the fibroblast-like cells, next the chondrocytes, and finally, the notochordal cells. The findings suggest that cells situated at the periphery predominantly depend on aerobic metabolism, whereas the cells situated more centrally depend on anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, postmortem changes of the nucleus pulposus were similar to age-related changes. The age-related changes or degeneration in the intervertebral disc appear to be related to deficiencies of nutrition or oxygen caused by changes in structures of the disc and the surrounding tissues.\r"

Significant positive logarithmic regressions were obtained, however, between the in vivo and in vitro measures of trabecular bone density and trabecular bone mechanical properties.

Twenty-three (36%) of 64 patients showed postoperative changes in curvature type and 9 (14%) had developed spinal deformity (kyphotic or meandering-type curvature). In two juvenile patients, the deformity developed soon after operation and spinal fusion was required to prevent neurologic complications. In the adult cases, contrary to the hitherto accepted concept, long-term follow-up revealed the tendency of the deformity to develop more frequently in OPLL cases than in CS cases. Mobility of the cervical spine was reduced considerably after laminectomy, both in CS and OPLL cases. There was no adult patient who required further operation for severe deformity or instability after laminectomy. Extensive laminectomy, even including the C2 lamina, seemed to have no adverse effect on the stability of the cervical spine.\r"

An early noninvasive test would be valuable since early operation yields better survival rates. We have used an in vivo rat model to study acute intestinal ischemia after occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). 31Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a noninvasive nondestructive technique, can detect the phosphorus metabolites most likely to be altered in ischemia: adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters. Furthermore, intracellular pH can be estimated from the pH dependent position of the Pi spectral line relative to PCr. A tourniquet was loosely placed around the SMA in five Wistar rats through a transabdominal approach to the retroperitoneum. The abdomen was immediately closed. A 20 millimeter MRS surface coil was placed on the abdomen and 31Phosphorus spectra were accumulated. The SMA was then occluded and additional 31Phosphorus spectra were taken for the next 75 minutes. Significant (p less than 10(-4) changes in the position and magnitude of the spectra lines occurred within 20 minutes; the Pi position indicates severe intracellular acidosis and rapidly increases to three times its original magnitude. The PCr line decreases in magnitude. In a similar experiment, occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) produced equivalent results. Occlusion of vessels other than the SMA or SMV not accompanied by transmural ischemia resulted in spectra unaltered from control. These findings support the application of phosphorus MRS to clinical studies.\r"

Cachectin was administered by intra-arterial infusion in two groups of beagle dogs at lethal (100 micrograms per kilogram) and sublethal (10 micrograms per kilogram) doses. The infusion produced serum cachectin levels (1 to 50 nanomoles per liter) similar to those achieved after experimental endotoxemia. The lethal response to cachectin was characterized by progressive hypotension, shock and death within three hours. Histopathologic findings included acute inflammation of the pulmonary interstitium, intravascular thrombosis with hemorrhagic necrosis, adrenal medullary necrosis and acute renal tubular necrosis. Cachectin infusion precipitated significant increases of plasma catecholamines, cortisol and glucagon in a dose response manner. Cachectin infused directly into the isolated hindlimb mediated reductions of skeletal muscle resting transmembrane potential and stimulated lactate efflux. Cachectin appears to occupy a crucial role in physiopathologic responses to infection, and likely participates in the mobilization of host energy stores, intravascular depletion and shock after lethal endotoxemia.\r"

Compared with a control group matched for age and parity, we found a significantly increased risk in the obese patient for gestational diabetes, hypertension, therapeutic induction, prolonged second stage of labor, oxytocin stimulation of labor, shoulder dystocia, infants weighing more than 4,000 grams and delivery after 42 weeks gestation. Certain operative complications were also more common in obese women undergoing cesarean section including estimated blood loss of more than 1,000 milliliters, operating time of more than two hours and wound infection postoperatively. These differences remained significant after controlling for appropriate confounding variables. We conclude that maternal obesity should be considered a high risk factor.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of splenectomy on hepatic regeneration after 70 per cent partial hepatectomy was studied in rats. Compared with nonsplenectomized rats, preliminarily splenectomized rats showed significantly increased weights of the liver in the early stage (up to four days) after hepatectomy and significantly promoted deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in the regenerating liver in terms of high levels of 3H-thymidine uptake, thymidine kinase activity and mitotic index in the residual liver 24 hours after hepatectomy. The splenic factor inhibiting hepatic regeneration, as previously suggested, was investigated by using primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. At 48 hours when the 3H-thymidine uptake by cultured hepatocytes reached maximum, the group containing a splenic extract showed significantly lower levels (p less than 0.005) of uptake than did the group without the extract and the group containing splenic venous serum also showed lower levels. This splenic factor was labile against heat and lost activity by trypsinization. Furthermore, gel filtration by the use of Sephadex G-75 column suggested the factor to be a protein-like substance with a molecular weight of 50,000 to 60,000. It is likely that a protein-like substance inhibiting hepatic regeneration after hepatectomy is present in the spleen.\r"

The patients examined were a mixed population comprising approximately 55 per cent symptomatic and 45 per cent screening patients. The over-all detection rate for cancer was 33.0 per 1,000 for all cancers and 7.6 per 1,000 for clinically occult cancers. For the 93 patients with clinically occult lesions, the yield ratio for biopsy for cancer was 36 per cent. The cost in Canadian dollars per diagnosis for occult carcinoma of the breast was $10,657. These results demonstrate the efficacy of xeromammographic examination of the breast in accomplishing early diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast. Xeromammography is an accurate and sensitive tool both for screening and assessment of symptomatic patients and is ideal for use in a private office setting.\r"

One hundred and eighty-seven patients with clinical signs of root compression underwent lumbar epidural steroid injection. Eighty-five of these patients had been told that an operation on the lumbar spine would be necessary. Over the ensuing one to three years, only 34 of these patients eventually required an operation upon the lumbar spine or an injection of chymopapain. Fifty-four per cent of the patients who were unimproved after epidural steroid injection were also unimproved after chymopapain whereas all patients who were improved, even transiently, after epidural steroid injection were improved after chymopapain injection. A statistical comparison of these two groups revealed the probability of these occurrences of 0.088. There was no correlation between outcome of open surgical procedures and response to epidural steroids. Epidural steroid injection may be a valuable aid to predicting the outcome of chemonucleolysis.\r"

These advantages were realized in this series of patients without delay in the operative procedure.

Previous studies from this laboratory have indicated its efficacy in preventing basilar artery contraction induced by serotonin. The animals treated with a subarachnoid perfusion of whole blood had a mean 30% reduction in vessel diameter over the control value. Groups that were treated with 0.5 mg/kg of lidoflazine and 1.0 mg/kg of lidoflazine and then perfused with whole blood in the subarachnoid space had reductions in control diameter of 2.8% and 6.8%, respectively. One group treated with 2.0 mg/kg of lidoflazine and then perfused with whole blood actually had an increase in diameter of 6.8% over the control value. Lidoflazine, when administered intravenously at a slow rate, will not adversely lower systemic blood pressure and can prevent the contraction of cerebral vessels when the stimulus for contraction is whole blood within the subarachnoid space.\r"

During a mean follow-up of 20 months (range: 6 to 44 months), varices recurred in three patients and enlarged in five others. This study suggests that variceal obliteration, a reduction in variceal diameter, the removal of the bleeding zone in the esophagus, and undetectable blood flow in residual varices all contribute to the prevention of variceal rebleeding; although these changes are not always permanent, the return to the preoperative state may take many years.\r"

  ".W": "A new approach consisting of sclerotherapy, embolization, and splenopneumopexy was designed to treat esophageal varices, which were caused by cirrhosis of the liver in 13 patients and by idiopathic portal hypertension in three. No serious complications occurred. Fifteen of the patients were well and without recurrent bleeding or encephalopathy during the 29-month follow-up period. One patient died of hepatic failure 4 months postoperatively. The varices either disappeared or were significantly improved. Placement of a portopulmonary shunt by splenopneumopexy is a safe, simple, and effective procedure for the resolution of varices that recur following sclerotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "87206624\r", 
  ".W": "From October 1981 to the end of 1984, 13 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and 17 with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) received fresh autografts of diseased parathyroid tissue into their subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. Because of previous surgery to treat hyperparathyroidism (HPT) (23%), concomitant thyroid surgery (26%), and a high proportion of multiglandular disease (73%), the patients were at high risk for HPT. During the follow-up period, hypercalcemia was diagnosed in five patients and successfully treated in four: by graft excision in two patients, by excision of a fourth gland from the neck in one patient, and with prednisolone in a patient with sarcoidosis. At follow-up (an average of 30 months after grafting), one patient had HPT and 29 others were euparathyroid. Parathyroid tissue can survive and function in adipose tissue, as was demonstrated by normocalcemia in 14 patients (whose only probable remaining parathyroid tissue had been transplanted into fat), by the demonstration that graft-dependent hypercalcemia could be eliminated by excision of the transplant, and by the demonstration of viable parathyroid tissue by microscopic examination of excised grafts. Autotransplantation of diseased parathyroid tissue into fat is simple and reliable. In cases of recurrent HPT, all or a portion of the graft can be removed while the patient is under local anaesthesia. If infiltrating growth occurs, broad excisions can be performed without sacrificing vital structures.\r"

  ".W": "After a mean follow-up period of 6.1 years, a series of 862 patients who had undergone surgery for suspected hyperparathyroidism were evaluated to determine the reasons treatment failed. Incorrect diagnosis was found to be the cause of failure in 27 cases (3%). In 89 patients who required reoperation to achieve euparathyroidism, the three major reasons for failure were inexperience with the surgical procedure (n = 37), abnormal localization (n = 36), and multiglandular disease (n = 39). In patients with monoglandular involvement, the disease never recurred. However, of the 41 patients with more than one enlarged parathyroid gland, 20 had persistent disease and 21 others had recurrent disease with a normocalcemic interval of 1.2 to 17 years. In general, recurrent hyperparathyroidism occurs more frequently than is usually realized and thus patients with multiglandular involvement require very long follow-up periods. Persistent monoglandular disease is largely avoidable.\r"

  ".U": "87206627\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that the generation of oxygen-derived free radicals during the reperfusion of injured tissue causes organ dysfunction. The mechanism apparently involves the xanthine oxidase (XOD) enzyme system, which becomes activated during reperfusion and generates oxygen-derived free radicals faster than their dismutation by naturally occurring superoxide dismutase (SOD). In this study, we measured the XOD and SOD activities of liver and kidney tissue in species used for organ preservation studies (rats, dogs, and human beings). We also measured the effect that up to 5 days of hypothermic preservation has on the activity of SOD and XOD in canine kidneys and expressed activities as the ratio of SOD to XOD; large ratios suggest lower susceptibility to oxygen-derived free radical damage. The SOD:XOD ratios for rat tissue were consistently lower (kidney = 2.7 X 10(4), liver = 8.9 X 10(3)) than for canine tissue (kidney = 7.0 X 10(5), liver = 4.1 X 10(4)) and human tissue (kidney = 1.1 X 10(6), liver = 6.4 X 10(5)). Canine kidneys perfused for 3 days showed no change in SOD:XOD ratio. After 5 days of perfusion, the SOD:XOD ratio decreased by 50% but was still quite large (5 X 10(5]. This high SOD:XOD ratio in canine and human tissues suggests that they may be less sensitive to oxygen-derived free radical damage than rat tissues.\r"

  ".W": "This prospective study evaluates the use of intraoperative flexible choledochoscopy in the detection and removal of additional stones after conventional bile duct exploration. The biliary system of 109 patients was examined with an Olympus CHF-B4 choledochoscope after conventional methods of exploration. Sixty-five patients had only common duct stones and 44 patients had intrahepatic stones with or without stones in the common duct. Additional stones were detected in 11 patients (16.9%) in the group with common duct stones; eight of these patients had their stones completely removed. Unsuspected residual stones were discovered by means of postoperative cholangiography in three more patients (4.6%); thus the total number of patients with residual stones was six (9.2%). Additional stones were detected in 39 patients (88.6%) in the group with intrahepatic stones. Of these, only 13 patients managed to be freed of stones with the use of the choledochoscope. A further 10 patients underwent liver resection to achieve stone clearance. Unsuspected retained stones were found postoperatively in seven of the 28 patients (25%) whose biliary systems were considered clear of stones. The overall number of patients with retained stones in the group with intrahepatic stones was 23 (52.3%). We concluded that intraoperative flexible choledochoscopy is useful in detecting intrahepatic stones left behind after conventional exploration. However, complete removal of the stones is difficult to achieve.\r"
