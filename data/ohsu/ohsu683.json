Patients in the first or second decades of life developed symptoms which included weight loss, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, constipation and diarrhoea, and urinary symptoms. The radiological features of the disease consisted of oesophageal aperistalsis, megaduodenum, and variable dilatation of the small and large bowel. Four patients had urinary tract involvement with dilatation of the ureters and/or incomplete bladder emptying. Two patients were severely affected and needed home parenteral nutrition and surgical treatment; others were symptomatic but remained well. The characteristic pathological abnormality was vacuolar degeneration predominantly affecting the longitudinal muscle. The disease in this family appears to be transmitted by autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.\r"

We used plasmids which were constructed so that the promoter or enhancer of interest initiated transcription of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Plasmids were introduced into primary rat hepatocytes in culture, into Hep G2 cells and other human and animal cell lines and into bone marrow stromal cells, and CAT activity was assayed after 48 hr. In primary rat hepatocytes, the highest CAT activity was obtained with plasmids carrying the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (pRSVCAT), or the SV40 early region promoter and enhancer (pSV2CAT). Hepatocytes carrying the murine cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (pUCRNmCMVX/HCAT) also had appreciable CAT activity. No CAT activity was detected in rat hepatocytes carrying pSVOCAT (a promoterless construct), pUCRNtKCAT (herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene promoter), pLPVCAT (lymphocytotrophic papovavirus promoter) and pHBV1CAT (hepatitis B virus enhancer and core gene promoter). Therefore, for future studies of gene transfer in primary rat hepatocytes, the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat or the SV40 early region promoter and enhancer can be effectively used to drive gene expression. Hep G2 cells carrying pHBV1CAT had high CAT activity. Hep G2 cells carrying pHBV2CAT (similar to pHBV1CAT, but with the hepatitis B virus sequences in reverse orientation with respect to the CAT sequences) and pHBV3CAT (similar to pHBV2CAT, but hepatitis B virus sequences are separated from the CAT sequences by about 700 bases) also expressed CAT activity, but not as strongly as with pHBV1CAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated in the normal rat the effects of intraportal endotoxin administration and the possible mediation of these effects by platelet-activating factor. Injection of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (10 and 25 mg per kg) in the rat resulted in rapid ascites formation, as well as systemic hypotension, hemoconcentration and acute erosions of the gastrointestinal mucosa. These effects were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with L652,731 and CF-3988, specific platelet-activating factor antagonists. Administration of 25 mg per kg endotoxin also resulted in significant elevations of platelet-activating factor biosynthesis in vitro by samples of duodenum, liver and lung. The effects of endotoxin were mimicked by intraportal infusion of platelet-activating factor (50 ng per kg per min), which induced ascites and gastrointestinal lesions. Platelet-activating factor reduced circulating plasma volume and increased peritoneal permeability to albumin as assessed by the ascites to plasma ratio of labeled albumin. These results, therefore, support a role for platelet-activating factor in mediating endotoxin-induced ascites and gastrointestinal erosions.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a serum parameter of collagen metabolism, serum procollagen type III peptide, correlated with hepatic collagen in a model of diet-induced fibrosis, rats were fed a control or cirrhogenic diet for 6 months and treated with either subcutaneous vehicle or the hepatoprotective prostaglandin 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (100 micrograms per kg) twice daily. Pair-fed rats from each group were killed after 2, 4 or 6 months. The value of serum procollagen type III peptide to body weight integrated over time (Kt) correlated linearly with hepatic hydroxyproline content (r = 0.97) at killing time t. Good correlations were also seen between Kt and histopathological assessment of aniline blue-stainable collagen (r = 0.93) and between the histopathology and hydroxyproline content (r = 0.97). Rats receiving 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 had lower values of all three parameters compared to rats receiving vehicle, confirming the previously demonstrated hepatoprotective effect of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. The excellent correlation between Kt and the two other traditional parameters of hepatic collagen suggest that sequential measurements of serum procollagen type III peptide can be used to predict alterations in liver collagen deposition in rats.\r"

It was surprising that only one liver protein-acetaldehyde adduct was found. In this report, we have tried to detect additional protein-acetaldehyde adducts by electroimmunotransblot with rabbit anti-hemocyanin-acetaldehyde adduct IgG and to further characterize the 37 kD liver protein-acetaldehyde adduct. Sensitivity of electroimmunotransblot increased 10- to 20-fold when alkaline phosphatase-linked antibody was used in place of horseradish peroxidase, but only one protein-acetaldehyde adduct band was detected in liver. Feeding rats the Lieber-DeCarli alcohol diet also did not produce more protein-acetaldehyde adduct bands in electroimmunotransblot. Addition of cyanamide, an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, to the AIN'76 alcohol diet greatly increased the intensity of the 37-kD protein-acetaldehyde adduct band on electroimmunotransblot but did not produce other bands. The 37 kD protein-acetaldehyde adduct decayed in vivo with a half-life of 4 days when alcohol was removed from the diet. The 37 kD protein-acetaldehyde adduct in liver is cytosolic. Its interaction with anti-hemocyanin-acetaldehyde adduct IgG was blocked by polylysine-acetaldehyde adduct and polytyrosine-acetaldehyde adduct. It could be removed by immunosorption with anti-hemocyanin-acetaldehyde adduct IgG-bound immunoresin. When immunoblotted with anti-alcohol dehydrogenase and anti-aldehyde dehydrogenase antibodies, the alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase bands in liver of alcohol-fed rats showed identical intensities before and after immunosorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of chronic ethanol feeding on hepatic lipid peroxidation, ascorbic acid, glutathione and vitamin E levels were investigated in rats fed low or adequate amounts of dietary vitamin E. Hepatic lipid peroxidation was significantly increased after chronic ethanol feeding in rats receiving a low-vitamin E diet, indicating that dietary vitamin E is an important determinant of hepatic lipid peroxidation induced by chronic ethanol feeding. No significant change was observed in hepatic non-heme iron content, but hepatic content of ascorbic acid and glutathione was increased by ethanol feeding. Both low dietary vitamin E and ethanol feeding significantly reduced hepatic alpha-tocopherol content, and the lowest hepatic alpha-tocopherol was found in rats receiving a combination of low vitamin E and ethanol. Plasma alpha-tocopherol was elevated after ethanol feeding, probably because of the associated hyperlipemia. Both the ratio of plasma alpha-tocopherol/plasma lipid and the red blood cell alpha-tocopherol were reduced by ethanol feeding. Furthermore, ethanol feeding caused a marked increase of hepatic alpha-tocopheryl quinone, a metabolite of alpha-tocopherol by free radical reactions. Ethanol feeding caused little changes of alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopheryl quinone content in mitochondria, whereas a striking increase in alpha-tocopheryl quinone was observed in microsomes. These data suggest that ethanol feeding causes a marked alteration of vitamin E metabolism in the liver and that the combination of ethanol with a low-vitamin E intake results in a decrease of hepatic alpha-tocopherol content which renders the liver more susceptible to free radical attack.\r"

  ".W": "L-Carnitine (16 mmoles per kg, injected intraperitoneally) is reported to protect mice against subsequent injection of ammonium acetate given at the unprotected LD100. The present studies in rats show a variable protective effect of L-carnitine (16 mmoles per kg) administered 1 hr prior to an LD100 dose of ammonium acetate. Survival ranged from 100% to 35%. In two experiments, protection was highly significant; in a third experiment, L-carnitine did not protect against death but did significantly prolong time to death. Although the cause of this variability is not known, the data establish the protective effect in rats of L-carnitine given 1 hr before ammonium acetate. D-Carnitine and deoxycarnitine, chemically related analogs unable to substitute for L-carnitine metabolically, are without protective effect. The protective effect of L-carnitine is short-lived and is, for example, completely lost if ammonium acetate is given 24 hr after L-carnitine administration. In contrast, the free carnitine content of brain rises slowly but continuously for at least 24 hr following a single dose of L-carnitine. The observation that protection from ammonia toxicity is not correlated with brain carnitine levels strongly suggests a major peripheral component to the protective effect. Chronically hyperammonemic (portacaval-shunted) rats were found to have significantly depressed total and free carnitine levels in blood compared to normal and sham-operated controls. The hypocarnitinemia, but not the hyperammonemia, was completely reversed in portacaval-shunted rats given drinking water containing 10 mM L-carnitine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Following the i.p. administration of [1-14C]-alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, 14CO2 exhalation reached a peak within 10 to 20 min and then declined exponentially, with a half-life of 14.3 min. Control animals exhaled 38.6% of the administered radioactivity within 1 hr. In functionally anhepatic animals, 14CO2 in breath amounted to 23% of that in control animals, indicating that alpha-ketoisocaproic acid decarboxylation reflects mainly hepatic mitochondrial function in vivo. Ethanol (3 gm per kg) significantly decreased alpha-ketoisocaproic acid decarboxylation (21.8% of the dose appearing in breath in 1 hr), probably due to the ethanol-induced shift in the NAD+:NADH ratio. In contrast, an uncoupler of mitochondrial respiration, sodium salicylate (375 mg per kg), increased the decarboxylation of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (56.3% of the dose recovered as 14CO2 in 1 hr). Mitochondrial damage induced by 4-pentenoic acid decreased the decarboxylation of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid but did not affect the microsomal metabolism of antipyrine. The present data indicate that the alpha-ketoisocaproic acid breath test provides a noninvasive estimate of hepatic mitochondrial function in vivo which, when applied to man, might yield clinically useful information.\r"

  ".W": "Pathological elevations of the plasma activities of liver enzymes are not simply related to the quantitative release of such enzymes from the liver. Several enzymatic indices, such as the well-known de Ritis quotient, may be determined by differences in the time course of hepatic enzyme release, rather than reflecting true differences in the released quantities of various enzymes. A more quantitative use of enzymatic data is hampered by the fact that the fractional catabolic rate constants for the elimination of enzyme activities from plasma are unknown. In the present study, three of these constants are estimated by comparison of the time-activity curves in plasma with the corresponding curve of a simultaneously released, more slowly eliminated reference enzyme. This method can be applied in patients with an acute short period of hepatic enzyme release. Values obtained for the cytosolic isoforms of lactate dehydrogenase, AST and ALT are: fractional catabolic rate constant (lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme 5) = 0.13 +/- 0.01 hr-1, fractional catabolic rate constant (cytosolic AST) = 0.088 +/- 0.016 hr-1 and fractional catabolic rate constant (cytosolic ALT) = 0.034 +/- 0.004 hr-1 (mean +/- S.E., n = 10). These values are much higher than the apparent disappearance rate constants, because of extravascular return of activity and tailing release of enzymes during the major part of the elimination phase. It is shown that these results are consistent with earlier published data on the disappearance rates from plasma of lactate dehydrogenase, AST and ALT after acute liver injury. Cumulative release of various cytosolic enzymes occurred in proportion to the corresponding activities in human control livers.\r"

Ursocholic, cholic, ursodeoxycholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, free and taurine-conjugated, were injected into the portal vein in dose response studies, using a nonrecirculating perfusion system. For all of the bile acids, the uptake process showed saturation. In addition, a nonsaturable component was apparent in bile acids provided with the lowest hydrophilicity values, as expressed by the lowest values of the water to octanol partition coefficient. The maximum uptake velocity increased with increasing values of the partition coefficient, which in turn were associated with 7-OH alpha to beta epimerization, the presence of 12-OH in alpha position and taurine conjugation. The ratio of maximum uptake velocity to Km (Km being the half-saturation constant) appeared to be markedly increased by taurine conjugation and by 7-OH alpha to beta epimerization, whereas it was reduced by the presence of 12-OH in alpha position.\r"

We examined the morphologies of 99 macroregenerative nodules in 44 cirrhotic livers with special emphasis on stainable iron. In 26 macroregenerative nodules (26%), stainable iron selectively accumulated within the macroregenerative nodules themselves, and little or no iron was found in the surrounding regenerative nodules. In nine macroregenerative nodules (9%), an appreciable amount of stainable iron was present in both the macroregenerative nodules and the surrounding regenerative nodules. In the remaining 64 macroregenerative nodules (65%), stainable iron was absent in both the macroregenerative nodules and the surrounding regenerative nodules. Hyperplastic hepatocellular foci were present within 19 (73%) of the 26 iron-accumulative macroregenerative nodules, one (11%) of the nine iron-positive macroregenerative nodules and 20 (31%) of the 64 iron-negative macroregenerative nodules. These findings suggest that iron-accumulative macroregenerative nodules are frequently associated with hyperplastic hepatocellular foci and should be included among the precancerous lesions in human hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Adult male and female rats were subjected to orthotopic liver transplantation, using donors from both the same and the opposite sex as the recipient. The animals were killed on the tenth postoperative day, and the livers were assayed to determine their cytosolic estrogen and androgen receptor content. Transplantation of a liver from a male donor into a male recipient, from a male donor into female recipient and from a female donor into a male recipient produced similar changes in the number of cytosolic estrogen and androgen receptors in hepatic cytosol. In all three situations, the estrogen receptor content in the cytosol of the transplanted liver was the same as that found in an unoperated male liver, and the cytosolic content of the androgen receptor was the same as that of an unoperated female liver. After transplantation of the liver from a female donor into a female recipient, the estrogen and androgen receptor content in the cytosol of the transplanted liver was the same as that of an unoperated female.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Reducing the size of a liver for use in a recipient smaller than the donor is one way to reduce mortality before orthotopic liver transplantation in children because of the scarcity of pediatric organ donors. In this report, we review the results of this approach over the past 2 years, during which we have used reduced-size orthotopic liver transplantation routinely in small children. Forty-nine children underwent orthotopic liver transplantation between September, 1986, and October, 1988; orthotopic liver transplantation with a whole organ (full-size orthotopic liver transplantation) was performed in 36 children, whereas 13 patients received reduced-size orthotopic liver transplantation. In two pairs of patients, the reduced grafts were obtained from single donors, using a \"split-liver\" procedure. All grafts were implanted in the orthotopic position following total recipient hepatectomy. The preoperative diagnostic categories were not significantly different between groups. Patients receiving reduced-size orthotopic liver transplantation were younger (1.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 4.4 +/- 4.6 years), and a higher percentage were in the intensive care unit prior to transplant (31 vs. 9%). Thirty of 36 (82%) patients receiving full-size orthotopic liver transplantation and 10 of 13 (77%) patients receiving reduced-size orthotopic liver transplantation are alive 3 to 27 months after transplantation. The rates of retransplantation were 24% for full-size orthotopic liver transplantation and 15% for reduced-size orthotopic liver transplantation. Despite the greater complexity of reduced-size orthotopic liver transplantation and the higher frequency of critically ill recipients selected for the procedure, the results of reduced-size orthotopic liver transplantation are comparable with full-size orthotopic liver transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Wedge liver biopsy specimens were taken at the beginning of the surgical procedure from 100 consecutive morbidly obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Histological abnormalities were found in almost all of the examined material (98 of 100), which ranged from mild fatty infiltration through inflammatory change and alcoholic hepatitis-like change to fibrosis and cirrhosis. The patients with abnormalities were divided into two groups: those with a single abnormality (n = 56) and those with two or more histopathological findings (n = 42). Age, excess body weight, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the group with more than one histopathological finding. In a discriminant function analysis, it was found that the preoperatively available measures of age, sex and excess body weight, as well as ALT and triglyceride levels, could discriminate between the two patient groups. A model which uses these variables has been described which correctly assigns the patients to their histology groups in 73% of the cases. This model could provide a useful noninvasive clinical tool for the preoperative evaluation of possible hepatic damage in morbidly obese patients in whom there is no other known cause of possible liver disease.\r"

  ".W": "A specific angiotensin II monoclonal antibody, KAA8, was used to examine the interaction between sympathetic function and angiotensin II in pithed rats. KAA8, at 5 or 50 mg/kg i.v., did not alter the mean blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, or heart rate responses to sympathetic neural stimulation (0.25-4.0 Hz) or to norepinephrine (0.3-3 micrograms/kg i.v.) but blocked significantly the hemodynamic responses to angiotensin II (0.03-1.0 microgram/kg i.v.) and to angiotensin III (0.3-10 micrograms/kg i.v.). KAA8 treatment also reduced the plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II from 2,880 +/- 475 pg/ml to an undetectable level. In contrast, captopril (5 mg/kg i.v.) and saralasin (10 or 50 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) inhibited the mean blood pressure and total peripheral resistance responses, but not the cardiac output and heart rate responses, to sympathetic neural stimulation and to norepinephrine. These results, which confirm previous findings by Kaufman and Vollmer (Kaufman LJ, Vollmer RR: Endogenous angiotensin II facilitates sympathetically mediated hemodynamic responses in pithed rats. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 1985;235:128-134), demonstrate that angiotensin II selectively potentiates the sympathetic vascular function in the pithed rat. However, our results suggest that circulating angiotensin II does not appear to interact with the sympathetic vascular function. It is speculated that in the pithed rat the sympathetic vascular response is enhanced by vascular-formed angiotensin II.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of increased arterial pressure lability after sinoaortic deafferentation remain unknown. We have shown previously in rats with chronic sinoaortic deafferentation (7-14 days after sinoaortic deafferentation) that ganglionic blockade significantly reduced mean arterial pressure and arterial pressure lability. The present study investigated the possibility that lability is related to the level of arterial pressure. Rats were instrumented chronically and heart rate and mean arterial pressure were sampled every 5 seconds in the conscious, freely moving state. Graded sustained increases in pressure (+10 to +82 mm Hg) produced by constant infusion of angiotensin II, phenylephrine, or vasopressin did not affect lability (standard deviation of 30-minute sampling period); whereas, graded hypotension (-10 to -70 mm Hg) produced by infusions of adenosine, nitroprusside, or nisoldipine appeared to reduce lability. Analysis of covariance and orthogonal polynomial curve fitting demonstrated a significant correlation between the decrease in mean arterial pressure and the decrease in lability produced by nisoldipine but not by adenosine or nitroprusside. Lability does not appear to be solely dependent on the level of arterial pressure because lability was reduced by adenosine when pressure was maintained at control levels by simultaneous infusion of phenylephrine. We conclude that 1) arterial pressure lability is not influenced by elevation of arterial pressure but can be reduced when pressure is lowered by certain vasodilators and 2) pressure alone does not appear to be the major determinant of lability because it can be attenuated by vascular smooth muscle relaxants even when pressure is maintained.\r"

There was a concomitant significant rise in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, from 125 +/- 2/74 +/- 2 to 140 +/- 4/84 +/- 3 mm Hg. After micturition, sympathetic activity and blood pressure returned toward initial values. It is concluded that 1) increased sympathetic outflow contributed to the rise in blood pressure, 2) there is a vesicovascular response mediated by sympathetic vasoconstrictor neurons in humans corresponding to mechanisms observed in animals, and 3) the described functional relation between bladder distension and sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity probably plays a role in clinical conditions such as autonomic dysreflexia in humans with cervical spinal cord lesions and nocturnal micturition syncope.\r"

The current study tested the hypothesis that an impairment in cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex function exists in SHR-S before NaCl loading. The reflex response to volume expansion was compared in SHR-S, NaCl-resistant SHR (SHR-R), and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on a normal NaCl diet. Conscious, free-moving SHR-S, SHR-R, WKY, and Sprague-Dawley rats were volume expanded with whole blood to 15% of blood volume within 6 minutes, and mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity were recorded. Heart rate and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity decreased significantly in SHR-R, WKY, and Sprague-Dawley rats after volume expansion. In contrast, in SHR-S neither heart rate after volume expansion nor lumbar sympathetic nerve activity was significantly different from levels before volume expansion. The blunted reflex response of heart rate and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity to volume expansion suggests impaired cardiopulmonary volume receptor function in SHR-S. This likely contributes to NaCl-induced hypertension in SHR-S on a high NaCl diet.\r"

We studied 910 white male medical students who had their blood pressure and pulse rate measured before and during a cold pressor test in the years 1948-1964. Hypertensive status (requiring drug treatment) was ascertained by annual questionnaires in the 20- to 36-year follow-up period. An association was observed between maximum change in systolic blood pressure and later hypertension, with a cumulative incidence of hypertension by age 44 of 6.7%, 3.0%, and 2.4% for a change in systolic blood pressure in the upper, middle two, and lowest quartiles, respectively (Kaplan-Meier, p less than 0.02). After adjustment for study entry age, Quetelet Index, cigarette smoking, pretest systolic blood pressure, and paternal or maternal history of hypertension in a Cox model, the association persisted. The excess risk associated with systolic blood pressure reactivity was not apparent until the population aged some 20 years and was most apparent among those in whom hypertension developed before age 45 (relative risk = 2.5, 95% confidence intervals = 1.47, 4.71 for a 20 mm Hg change). Diastolic blood pressure and heart rate changes were not associated with later hypertension. These data suggest that persons prone to later hypertension manifest an altered physiology at a young age.\r"

  ".U": "90035290\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the acute effect of ethanol on the hypotensive response to clonidine in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. When administered during the hypotensive response to clonidine, ethanol not only reversed the response but also caused a slight but significant short-lived pressor effect. The maximal hypotensive effect of graded doses of clonidine was significantly (p less than 0.05) attenuated by a dose of 1 g/kg ethanol, which resulted in a peak blood ethanol concentration of 54.2 +/- 6.3 mg/dl. The data strongly suggest the adverse effect of ethanol on the hypotensive response to clonidine is ethanol mediated and that their antagonistic interaction is both reversible and reproducible because: 1) an equal volume of saline had no effect on the hemodynamic responses to clonidine and 2) crossing over ethanol and saline treatments on days 2 and 3, which allowed longitudinal comparisons, showed that the effect of ethanol was similar both in naive rats (day 1) and in rats that were pre-exposed to ethanol (day 3). Whether this negative effect of ethanol also involves other antihypertensive agents that do not act primarily by a central nervous system mechanism was investigated. The same dose of ethanol had little or no effect on the hypotensive response to hydralazine, suggesting the negative effect of ethanol is selective to centrally acting antihypertensive agents. Although the mechanism by which ethanol reverses the hypotensive effect of clonidine is not known, it is possible that it involves an ethanol-evoked increase in plasma catecholamine levels, which are known to be decreased by clonidine. That ethanol did not reverse the hypotensive effect of hydralazine, which is also known to be associated with increased plasma catecholamine levels, supports this notion. The findings of the present study may explain, at least in part, why regular use of alcohol is associated with an inadequate control of blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients who are regular consumers of alcohol.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to compare age-related changes in endothelium-dependent vascular responses in both hypertensive and normotensive rats. Aorta from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) aged 4-6 weeks (young), 3-6 months (adult), and 12-25 months (old) were examined for relaxation to acetylcholine, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), and sodium nitroprusside. Rubbed (endothelium denuded) aorta from all groups displayed neither relaxation nor contraction to acetylcholine. Maximal relaxation responses to acetylcholine were reduced progressively with increasing age in unrubbed aorta of both SHR and WKY rats. In addition, acetylcholine caused not only dose-dependent relaxations at lower concentrations but also increases in tension at higher concentrations in unrubbed aorta of old WKY rats as well as adult and old SHR. However, indomethacin completely inhibited the tension development. As a result, aorta treated with indomethacin demonstrated similar acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxations in all groups. The thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor (E)-7-phenyl-7-(3-pyridyl)-6-heptanoic acid (CV-4151) partially but significantly depressed the increases in tension in aorta of old WKY rats. The degrees of endothelium-dependent relaxations to ATP and endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were almost similar in all groups. These findings suggest that the release of or vascular responsiveness to endothelium-derived relaxing factor in the aorta is well maintained through senescence in both strains and that, in the aorta of not only SHR but also old normotensive WKY rats, the endothelium releases contracting factors that may be thromboxane A2 and other vasoconstrictor prostanoids.\r"

This has been attributed to the stabilizing action of calcium on the ionic permeability of the cell membrane. It is unknown whether this phenomenon is exclusively mediated by extracellular calcium or through associated changes in intracellular calcium. To examine this, we exposed rat aortic smooth muscle cells in culture to different calcium concentrations and studied their effects on the resting membrane potential and intracellular calcium activity. The resting membrane potential was dependent on the extracellular potassium concentration. Exposure to reduced extracellular calcium concentrations (0.25 and 0.5 mM) caused a steep and reversible depolarization of the membrane potential, but intracellular calcium, measured with fura 2-AM, was not reduced below that measured in control conditions (1.8 mM). Atomic absorption spectrophotometric measurements did not indicate a measurable gain in cell sodium after reduction of extracellular calcium levels. We conclude that extracellular calcium controls the resting cell membrane potential of vascular smooth muscle through a mechanism that is independent of cytosolic Ca2+ activity.\r"

There was also a significant association between sodium and slope (increase) of blood pressure with age across population samples. The weight of evidence from animal-experimental, clinical, intervention, and epidemiological data favors a causal relation. INTERSALT data from 52 centers in 32 countries permit an estimate of effect on average population blood pressure of lower sodium intake. Based on the sodium-blood pressure association in individuals, it was estimated that a habitual population sodium intake that was lower by 100 mmol/day (e.g., 70 vs. 170 mmol/day) would correspond to an average population systolic pressure that was lower by at least 2.2 mm Hg. This size difference in systolic blood pressure in major US and UK population studies is associated with 4% lower risk of coronary death and 6% lower risk of stroke death in middle age. If habitual diet is both lower in sodium and higher in potassium with lower alcohol intake and less obesity, INTERSALT data estimate average population systolic pressure would be lower by 5 mm Hg. This was calculated to correspond to a 9% lower risk of coronary death and a 14% lower risk of stroke death. INTERSALT cross-population data also suggest that, with a 100 mmol/day lower sodium intake over the life span, the average increase in population systolic pressure from age 25 to 55 years would be less by 9 mm Hg, corresponding at age 55 to a 16% lower risk of subsequent coronary death and 23% lower risk of stroke death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Probably a decrease in blood volume caused by ultrafiltration, and acetate are both involved, while refilling from the interstitium acts as a compensatory mechanism. An osmotically induced transcellular fluid shift to intracellular might reduce the refilling capacity. This study investigated the effect of ultrafiltration on blood volume, blood pressure and refilling. The role of acetate and blood volume decrease in hypotension was established and intra- and extracellular fluid changes were calculated. Blood volume decrease depended on ultrafiltration: at high ultrafiltration rates refilling failed, apparently more so at high acetate plasma levels. An isolated blood volume decrease did not lower blood pressure. Concomitant high acetate levels caused hypotension and also seemed to reduce refilling. Nearly all refilling fluid came from the extracellular compartment. Only high dialysate sodium concentrations gave rise to an intracellular loss.\r"

Nine patients with chronic or acute renal failure presented severe metabolic alkalosis (MA). Hemodialysis (HD) proved virtually ineffective and the MA persisted. Physiological saline solution was adopted as the main component of the PD fluid for the treatment of MA. By this method, Cl- can be shifted from PD fluid to extracellular fluid (ECF) and HCO3- from ECF to PD fluid by ionic gradient. Therefore, pH and base excess (BE) of these patients both improved to the normal range after several fluid exchanges. The lowering effect of BE (delta BE/L) ranged from 0.99 to 2.6. Hyposaline and normo-osmol solution (Na+ 70 mEq/L) were used for one patient with hypernatremia and consciousness disturbance. Serum (S)-Na decreased from 170 to 138 mEq/L, and consciousness became almost clear with the use of 15 L of PD fluid. Hypersaline solution (Na+ 190 mEq/L) was used for two patients with hyponatremia (S-Na 113 and 121 mEq/L). S-Na rose to within the normal range after 16 and 9 L in the two cases. A fluid mixed with distilled water, 10% NaCl and 7% NaHCO3 (HCO3 34-68 mEq/L) was used to treat lactic acidosis in two patients. By this method, HCO3- can be shifted from PD fluid to ECF and lactic acid from ECF to PD fluid. Two patients recovered from prolonged shock, and pH was corrected by 10 L and 4 L, respectively. PD should be considered for application in other diseases besides renal failure.\r"

To assess its reliability we employed mass balances and urea clearances to study 15 hemodialysis treatments divided in several parts. The mass balances clearly indicated urea disequilibrium. In the first phases of dialysis, urea extraction, measured by dialysate collection, was lower than the corresponding change in urea pool, whereas in the later phases the opposite occurred. On account of this lack of equilibrium, clearances bases on the Co/Ct ratio (K2) are less reliable than standard clearances derived from total dialysate collection (K1): in the first quarter of dialysis, K2 is greater than K1 (p less than 0.01), while in the 3rd and 4th quarters it is lower. The comparison of clearances in a cumulative way showed a significant fall in K2 (p less than 0.01) while K1 remained stable. From a practical point of view, aberrations induced by non monocompartmental urea behaviour are negligible, and do not invalidate the usefulness of the single-pool Gotch model in clinical practice. However, at least in experimental work, the limits of urea kinetic formulas must be taken into account.\r"

An experimental model of rat heart cardioplegia and transplantation comprising heart arrest for three hours at 20 degrees C was used. The number of hearts performing strong contractions after cardioplegia with iso-oncotic oxyhemoglobin prior to transplantation was close to the results with histidine-buffered cardioplegic solution according to Bretschneider. Comparative biochemical model experiments in vitro confirmed that the positive effect of oxyhemoglobin was due predominantly to its buffering capacity. The role of oxygen transport to tissues by hemoglobin was limited only to the first minutes of cardioplegia since neither recirculation nor reoxygenation took place in the present experimental setting.\r"

In this respect, a study has been made of granulocyte elastase to establish the influence of haemodialysis membranes on the release of this serine proteinase. Plasma levels of granulocyte elastase were determined as a complex with its natural inhibiter, alpha 1-proteinase. This elastase - alpha 1 proteinase (E- alpha 1 Pi) inhibitor complex was measured by a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay. The membranes evaluated were Cuprophan (15-11, Travenol) and polysulphone (F40, Fresenius). Samples were taken from patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis, before the start of dialysis, after 15 and 90 minutes and again at the end of dialysis (4 h). This investigation clearly demonstrates the different response of the dialysers, and on correcting for surface area, the end-dialysis level of E-alpha 1 Pi remained significantly greater for the Cuprophan membrane. The results support the view that the release of granulocyte elastase is a relevant parameter for inclusion in membrane compatibility assessment.\r"

In the present study we analysed whether similar oxidative damage is seen in the serum from hemodialysis patients and whether the serum fatty acid pattern is affected. No evidence was found of oxidative damage in the serum during hemodialysis, serum concentrations of MDA and VIT E remaining constant before and after dialysis. No change was observed in serum pattern of PUFA, particularly linoleic acid. We therefore assume that the oxidative damage described in uremic patients is mainly intracellular.\r"

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was added to 50 ml of saline containing 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 0.3% saponin. Platelet mean particle volume (MPV) was observed continuously for 200 seconds by a continuous mean particle analyzer model CC-108 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). Initial MPV (Vo, fl) was 7.12 +/- 0.89 and 7.68 +/- 0.56 respectively for the control and HD patients (p less than 0.05), and maximum MPV (V1) was 9.80 +/- 1.06 and 9.78 +/- 0.83, respectively (n.s.). The time of start of swelling (seconds) was 51.2 +/- 14.6 and 63.4 +/- 15.6 (p less than 0.05) and the time of V1 was 110.4 +/- 15.3 and 112.3 +/- 16.1 (n.s.), respectively. The expansion rates (V1/Vo) were 1.38 +/- 0.05 and 1.27 +/- 0.06, respectively (p less than 0.01). The low expansion rate means that the platelet is less responsive to saponin in HD patients, and this may be related to the cholesterol concentration in the platelet membrane and membrane flexibility. This new method offers a useful way of obtaining information about the platelet.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma concentration of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) was determined before, during and after hemodialysis in 28 patients with chronic renal failure. Pi plasma concentration decreased rapidly when hemodialysis was started but did not fall below normal levels during continued dialysis. These changes of Pi concentration were fitted to a model of Pi kinetics in which Pi delivery to plasma is a nonlinear function of the extracellular Pi concentration. In separate in vitro studies, erythrocytes from six subjects with normal renal function and from 14 patients with chronic renal failure were incubated in homologous plasma with various amounts of Pi added. All other factors known to affect the Pi shift between intra- and extracellular fluid compartments (pH, calcium concentration) were kept constant. The relation between Pi concentration in plasma used for incubation and in red cells after 1h incubation suggested a mechanism in which a high plasma concentration results in movement of Pi into red cells where Pi is stored most probably in glucose esters. At low Pi plasma concentration Pi is delivered to plasma at a rate which cannot be explained solely by passive movement of intracellular Pi to plasma but requires additional generation from intracellular storage forms. The generation and delivery of Pi in patients and in their erythrocytes indicate a simple cell-mediated Pi homeostasis counter-acting abnormal fluctuations of plasma Pi.\r"

The left ventricular function curve (LVFC) was drawn by plotting left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) against left atrial pressure (LAP). The coronary artery was occluded under a pump-on (ON group) or pump-off (OFF group). After reperfusion, measurements were repeated and changes in the LVFC caused by ischemia were compared in both groups. The gradient of the LVFC was significantly reduced by ischemia (107 +/- 15 ml/beat----80 +/- 14, n = 13) but not in the ON group. LVSW under normal preload did not significantly change in either group. This suggests that the LVAD preserved cardiac reserve against ischemic damage.\r"

We used a needle-type glucose sensor to study the kinetics of glucose transfer across the membrane of one such device. The glucose transfer was found to be dependent on the flow rate of the circulating medium, which suggests the involvement of an ultrafiltration flux across the membrane. The glucose concentration was heterogeneous within the cell compartment. This heterogeneity, and the delay in transmission of changes in glucose concentration from the circulating medium to the cell compartment, can be ascribed to the large volume of the compartment. The design of these bioreactors should therefore be modified, in order to meet the requirements of glucose transfer kinetics of a bioartificial pancreas.\r"

Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), bleeding time (BT), plasma fibrinogen levels, FDP and general blood cell examination (CBC) were measured pre and post DFPP. Heparin levels in plasma were lower than 1 (IU/ml) under the dosage of heparin nearly 40 IU/kg/h of heparin administered during DFPP. APTT before DFPP (36.5 +/- 8.2 sec) was nearly double the post-DFPP value (61.4 +/- 12.2 sec). In two patients who were given 30 IU/kg/h of heparin during DFPP, clotting occurred in the DFPP circuit. In conclusion, the optimized dosage of heparin was 40 IU per kg of body weight per hour during DFPP.\r"

The carotid lesion was asymptomatic in 64% of cases, 24% of the patients experienced previous transient cerebral ischemia and 12% of the patients had a history of completed stroke. Hospital mortality was 7.3%. Neurological deficit occurred in 7.3% but functional impairment was not permanent. Late results have been obtained for 76 survivors at a mean postoperative interval of 29 months. Five year life table survival rate was 86%. Follow-up showed that 3 patients (4%) have died and that 3 patients (4%) experienced a late neurologic event (one TIA; two strokes) but none of these events involved the cerebral cortex on the side of the carotid endarterectomy. The cumulative 5 year stroke free survival rate is 91%. We conclude that combined carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting can be done with an acceptable mortality rate in these critically ill patients and that the postoperative incidence of neurological events is low.\r"

From the opening of our institution in November 1984 until March 1988 5443 open-heart procedures were performed. In 116 patients of 3540 consecutive coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) candidates simultaneous carotid endarterectomy (TEA) was carried out because of hemodynamically relevant stenosis of one or both carotid arteries; 50 patients were neurologically symptomatic with TIA's and amaurosis fugax preoperatively. Sixty of 66 patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis had either a morphologically severe stenosis of the carotid artery or multifocal occlusive disease of the extracranial supraaortic arteries. Prior to carotid-TEA cardiopulmonary bypass was inserted with mild hypothermia maintaining a beating heart for pulsatile body perfusion. An intraluminal shunt was only used in patients with bilateral carotid stenosis. Intraoperative EEG-monitoring was carried out to detect cerebrovascular insufficiency. In 108/116 patients no neurological complications were observed, but 6/116 patients had transient minor neurological symptoms. Two of 116 patients sustained a severe neurological deficit with hemiplegia and one of them died on the 21st postoperative day. Based on these data we conclude that patients requiring carotid TEA and CABG should be operated upon simultaneously using cardiopulmonary bypass for both procedures.\r"

The systemic atrioventricular (A-V) valve was replaced in 2. There was one operative death, giving a mortality rate of 8%. None of the patients developed complete heart block. The ejection fraction of the systemic ventricle was impaired (29-38%), particularly after ventriculotomy of this chamber. Surgical repair of intracardiac defects associated with c-TGA currently can be performed with acceptable risk, and de Leval's method for VSD closure is recommended; but the possibility of the postoperative development of systemic ventricular dysfunction and A-V valve regurgitation necessitates careful follow-up.\r"

The infection was localized sufficiently to allow reconstruction without valve replacement in 9 patients (60%). Extensive annular and tri-leaflet infections (2 pts.) or significant residual regurgitation (2 pts.) prohibited reconstruction in four patients. In the remaining two patients, the relatively low intracardiac pressures allowed isolated tricuspid or pulmonary valvectomy (1 each). The single hospital mortality (6.7%) resulted from a missed secondary lesion during reparation. Late recurrence or replacement in the valvuloplasty group was 0 in 9 patients (0%) while late replacement or death from infection occurred in 2 of 5 patients (40%) in the valvectomy and replacement groups. Right-sided endocarditis is frequently amenable to reconstruction without late recurrence. Its advantage is in establishing satisfactory hemodynamics without prosthetic replacement. Alternatively, isolated valvectomy can be occasionally performed. Simultaneous or staged prosthetic replacement is frequently required for early (associated left-sided infection) and late (right-sided dilation) hemodynamic reasons.\r"

The adherence per unit area for staphylococci was least for monofilament polypropylene (Prolene), 3 times higher (p less than 0.05) for braided polyester (Mersiline) and greatest (10 times, p less than 0.005) for braided polyester sutures coated with polybutylate (Ethibond). Mean values for the adherence of streptococci were low for all the sutures. Sutures pretreated with human plasma showed a 12-37% increase in bacterial adherence. The cell surface hydrophobicity, surface charge and the haemagglutinating property of bacteria did not correlate with their adherence property. In view of these observations, it is suggested that: (a) the preferential adherence of staphylococci to intra-cardiac sutures may be one of the explanations for its being the commonest cause of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, (b) there is a need for a careful selection of sutures used in cardiac surgery and (c) the described in vitro assay for bacterial adherence may be used for monitoring the development of better designed sutures and the effect of incorporation of antibiotics in the sutures.\r"

All types of open heart procedures had approximately the same rate of infection except for left ventricular aneurysm repair plus coronary artery bypass grafting, which had a sternal wound infection rate of 5.8% (p less than 0.01). The use of single and double internal mammary artery grafts did not increase the rate of sternal wound infections. Treatment outcome was available for 39 patients. Twenty-eight patients were initially treated with debridement and closed mediastinal irrigation, which had a failure rate of 42% and a mortality rate of 35%. Six patients were initially treated with debridement, open packing, and muscle flap closure of the sternal wound. No deaths or treatment failures occurred in this group. The mortality and failure rates for the open treatment method were significantly better than for the closed treatment method in the initial treatment of sternal wound infections (p less than 0.05). These data, as well as a review of the literature, suggest that the open method is superior to the closed method in the initial treatment of deep sternal wound infections.\r"

During the DSA procedure complications occurred in two patients without serious consequences and bleeding at the puncture site was not observed in any patient whether mobilised at 24 or only 2 hours.

There was marked right ventricular hypertension in the banded animals. The hearts from all twelve animals were examined grossly and microscopically. There was endothelialization of all patches with no aneurysm formation. Measurements revealed that most patches had become oval shaped. There was no difference in patch size changes between banded and non-banded animals. The patches showed no significant size change in the longitudinal plane (average from 20.8 mm to 20.3 mm, 6.3% change); however, there was a significant decrease in the transverse size (20.8 mm to 17.3 mm, 16.0%) (p less than 0.001). The change in patch size was probably due to reshaping to conform to the longitudinal ventriculotomy and caused no narrowing. In this study, glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium appeared to be satisfactory for right ventricular outflow enlargement. Favorable qualities include ease of handling, hemostasis, and no aneurysm formation.\r"

Pseudointima from the mid portion of each type of graft was studied with light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An ocular micrometer was used to determine the thickness of the pseudointima. A trilaminar cytoarchitecture resembling the wall of a medium-sized artery existed in the pseudointima. This was characterized by an inner cellular layer, outer fibrocollagenous layer, and multi-interlamination of cells and glycosaminoglycan in the middle layer. The cellular inner layer was thickest in the knitted and thinnest in the woven 200 porosity. A zone of acellularity separated the luminal cells from the underlying myoblasts and myofibroblasts. Specificity of varying types of cell distribution occurred in the pseudointima. Myoblasts and myofibroblasts were located near the lumen while fibroblasts and mesenchymoid cells were situated near the graft. The luminal cells had the combined features of endothelial cells and myofibroblasts. Collagen and glycosaminoglycans were the dominant extracellular matrix. Despite the difference of fluid permeability in high porosity woven and knitted dacron grafts, the pseudointima was well formed and revealed no striking general cytoarchitectural difference between these two types of grafts.\r"

Serum elastase, neutrophil elastase and alpha-1-antitrypsin (A-1-AT) were determined in 20 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Neutrophil proteolytic activity was significantly lower the day of surgery and on postoperative day 6 while serum proteolytic activity was significantly higher the day of surgery and on postoperative day 6 compared to preoperative values. If increased serum proteolytic activity increases the chance of rupture of an AAA, then the release of neutrophil elastase may provide a mechanism whereby asymptomatic AAAs rupture after unrelated elective surgery.\r"

The purpose of this study was to correlate clinical evidence of vascular disease with the presence of the circulating immune complexes. Thirty-three patients suffering from Buerger's disease (EO), 20 patients suffering from atherosclerosis (AT) and 20 normal controls (Norm) were studied. All were male, heavy smokers, and age-matched. Five techniques were used: direct nephelometry, nephelometry with protamine, two polyethyleneglycol precipitation methods (PegIgG and PegC4), and an immuno-enzymatic C1q fixation test (C1qE). The results seem to confirm the presence of circulating immune complexes in peripheral arterial disease in young men who are heavy smokers, particularly those suffering from EO.\r"

One graft, occluded at 14 months, was salvaged with thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous angioplasty, and is patent 7 months post intervention. Occlusion occurred in 3 grafts at 1 day, 7 days and 4 months, respectively. Reasons for reduced patency of cryopreserved grafts are related to destruction of the cellular components and fibrosis as a result of the cryopreservation and poor distal run-off present in these patients. Due to lower patency as compared to autogenous vein grafts, cryopreserved veins should be reserved for limb salvage when no autogenous vein is available for revascularization.\r"

Ages ranged from 80 to 97 with a mean of 84 years. The procedural mortality rate was 3.1%. Cumulative life table survival rates for these patients were at 1 year, 92%; at 2 years, 76%; and at 3 years, 76%. The cumulative life table limb salvage rates were 92%, 88%, and 83% at the same intervals. Of the patients who died during the follow-up periods, 79% still had their previously-threatened limb intact. The results in these patients, as well as those from other series, support an aggressive policy of arterial reconstruction for elderly patients with limb-threatening ischemia.

Bound 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid was transferred into an acid-resistant membrane compartment at the rate of 0.9-1.0 pmol/10(6) cells per h. This folate appeared in the cytoplasm at the same rate. Furthermore, cytoplasmic 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid became polyglutamated at the rate of 0.6-0.7 pmol/10(6) cells per h. As soon as intracellular 5-methyltetrahydrofolate reached 5-7 pmol/10(6) cells, however, cytoplasmic accumulation was markedly inhibited even though the folate receptor remained functional. Therefore, the acute regulation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid accumulation appears to be achieved by controlling the movement of the vitamin from the receptor into the cytoplasm of the cell.\r"

Our results confirm that while ligation of surface immunoglobulin (sIg) receptors by antigen analogues (e.g., F(ab')2 goat anti-human IgM) does not lead to CD23 expression, this stimulus markedly enhances CD23 expression induced during antigen specific Th-B cell interaction or by rIL-4. Utilizing a panel of monoclonal anti-human IgM antibodies, we observed a positive correlation between the capacity of a particular antibody to synergize with rIL-4 in CD23 expression and with B cell growth factor in B cell proliferation; suggesting that synergy in CD23 expression reflects the transduction of a functionally important signal via the sIg receptor. We next assayed analogues of the \"second messenger\" molecules, released during inositol lipid hydrolysis, for their capacity to amplify CD23 expression. These studies showed that protein kinase C (PKC) activating phorbol esters and the synthetic diacylgylcerol analogue, DiC8, synergize with either Th cells or rIL-4 in CD23 expression, while under no experimental condition does increasing B cell [Ca2+]i with ionomycin enhance CD23 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that activation of B cell PKC is the crucial biochemical event that primes antigen-activated B cells to respond more vigorously to interaction with Th cells and/or their soluble products.\r"

The type I somatomedin receptor (SR) expressed in these cells may mediate the growth effects of these peptides. We have examined the role of this receptor on human breast cancer growth with a monoclonal antibody (alpha-IR-3) that blocks the receptor binding domain and inhibits IGF-I-induced growth. alpha-IR-3 inhibited clonal growth in vitro and blocked the mitogenic effect of exogenous IGF-I in both MCF-7 and MDA-231 breast cancer cell lines. Antibody-induced blockade of the type I SR also inhibited the estrogen-independent MDA-231 cells growing in vivo in nude mice, but growth of the estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells was unaffected. IGIs are important growth regulators of MDA-231 breast cancer cells. Blockade of this growth stimulatory pathway may provide a new treatment strategy.\r"

In osteoarthritic cartilage from dogs subjected to transection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), CMGP is cleaved to major immunoreactive fragments with apparent molecular weights of 65,000 and 75,000 after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. In the present study, using immunolocation analysis, a monoclonal antibody to CMGP did not react with serum from 8 of 12 dogs before ACL transection but did react with serum from seven of these animals 4 wk after surgery and with serum from 10 dogs at sacrifice, 8-14 wk after ACL transection. Serum from four dogs reacted with the monoclonal antibody before ACL transection. Serum from two dogs was negative at all time points. Immunolocation studies using a polyclonal antiserum to CMGP were performed in seven of these dogs and produced results identical with the monoclonal antibody in four dogs. In contrast, analysis of serial serum samples from three dogs with cartilage atrophy revealed no evidence of CMGP at any time point. These data suggest that CMGP may be a serum marker for osteoarthritis in this canine model.\r"

We investigated platelets from a patient with mild bleeding time prolongation, but otherwise normal coagulation data.

Labeling her platelets with 125I or 3H and analysis by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography showed normal levels of glycoproteins Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, and IV. However, there were significantly decreased incorporations of both radioactivities into a 61-kD membrane glycoprotein (GP), which was identified as GPVI from its mobility on unreduced-reduced, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Sugiyama et al. (1987. Blood. 69: 1712) reported that the serum from an idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patient contained an antibody against a 62-kD platelet protein. Our patient's platelets lacked the antigen for the ITP patient's antibody, demonstrating that the ITP serum contains a specific antibody against GPVI. The patient's parents' platelets contained approximately 50% the normal amount of GPVI, but still had normal collagen-induced aggregation and adhesion. The patient's platelets did not bind to types I and III collagen fibrils. Our results suggest that GPVI functions as a collagen receptor.\r"

This study used free-flow micropuncture to investigate bicarbonate reabsorption by surface nephron segments in a rat model of diuretic-induced alkalosis compared to control. The proximal and distal nephron of the alkalotic animals had higher values for both delivered load to and absolute reabsorption from these segments. The proximal tubules of alkalotic and control animals had similar values for the slopes of the linear regression of delivered load vs. reabsorption and for the bicarbonate tubular fluid to plasma (TF/P) ratio at the late proximal tubule. By contrast, the corresponding analysis for the distal segment of alkalotic animals revealed a greater slope (0.98 vs. 0.81, P less than 0.003) and a smaller bicarbonate TF/P ratio at the late distal tubule (0.10 vs. 0.16, P less than 0.006). The data indicate that augmented bicarbonate reabsorption by both the proximal and distal nephron contributes to maintaining the alkalosis of this model. The data suggest primary stimulation of bicarbonate reabsorption in the distal nephron and load-dependent reabsorption in the proximal tubule.\r"

Addition of VPF to cultures of vascular endothelial cells in vitro unexpectedly stimulated cellular proliferation. VPF promoted the growth of new blood vessels when administered into healing rabbit bone grafts or rat corneas. The identity of the growth factor activity with VPF was established in four ways: (a) the molecular weight of the activity in preparative SDS-PAGE was the same as VPF (Mr approximately 40 kD); (b) multiple isoforms (pI greater than or equal to 8) for both VPF and the growth-promoting activity were observed; (c) a single, unique NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was obtained; (d) both growth factor and permeability-enhancing activities were immunoadsorbed using antipeptide IgG that recognized the amino terminus of VPF. Furthermore, 125I-VPF was shown to bind specifically and with high affinity to endothelial cells in vitro and could be chemically cross-linked to a high-molecular weight cell surface receptor, thus demonstrating a mechanism whereby VPF can interact directly with endothelial cells. Unlike other endothelial cell growth factors, VPF did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation or promote growth of other cell types including mouse 3T3 fibroblasts or bovine smooth muscle cells. VPF, therefore, appears to be unique in its ability to specifically promote increased vascular permeability, endothelial cell growth, and angio-genesis.\r"

Extraadrenal tissues can clear circulating progesterone and progesterone sulfate by 21-hydroxylation to DOC and DOC-sulfate. It has previously been established that such extraadrenal 21-hydroxylase activity is widely distributed in adult and fetal tissues, but it has not been known if extra-adrenal 21-hydroxylation is mediated by the same P450c21 enzyme found in the adrenal. We examined human RNA from fetal adrenal, liver, kidney, lung, brain, heart, skin, spleen, testis, and placenta by solution hybridization to human P450c21 probes transcribed from cloned human P450c21 cDNA, followed by nuclease protection and acrylamide gel electrophoresis. No P450c21 mRNA was detectable in any extraadrenal tissue. The sensitivity of the assay would have detected P450c21 mRNA at 0.01% of its abundance in the human fetal adrenal. Similar experiments in rats showed no P450c21 mRNA in brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, testis, ovary, or uterus. These results clearly demonstrate that one or more enzymes other than the classical adrenal 21-hydroxylase are responsible for human and rat extraadrenal 21-hydroxylation.\r"

By adsorbing virus to a solid surface (microcentrifuge tubes or antibody coated microparticles) followed by proteinase K digestion, as little as three viruses per 200 microliters serum may be directly detected by PCR without nucleic acid extraction. The sensitivity is dependent on the surface area of the adsorptive surface and is increased by having antibodies on the adsorptive surface. The nucleic acid sequence of the amplified DNA fragments may be directly determined by the dideoxy method. Of 24 plasma samples from HBsAg+ volunteer blood donors, HBV DNA was detected in 7 by dot blot assay, 7 by liquid hybridization, and 9 by PCR. PCR detected DNA in every sample that was positive by another assay. Analysis of serial samples of two patients with acute self-limited hepatitis B found detectable HBsAg and pre-S2 antigenemia before HBV DNA by the PCR method.

At 1,000 microM copper for 1 h, there was a general reduction of protein synthesis, and no recognizable changes in cellular ultrastructure. Incubation of cells with 200 microM zinc acetate before exposure to copper, raised the LD50 for confluent cells to 1,250 microM copper chloride, improved protein synthesis, and increased synthesis of a 10-kD protein, apparently metallothionein. The mitigation, by zinc, of copper's toxicity may in part be mediated through induction of this protein in the hepatocyte.\r"

Maximal epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding was reduced in fibroblasts from three unrelated patients with leprechaunism (Ark-1, Can-1, and Minn-1) compared with control (0.8-2.2%/mg protein vs. 5.5%/mg protein). This was due to a decrease in receptor affinity in Ark-1 and Can-1 and a decrease in receptor number in Minn-1. In all cell lines, EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation was also decreased to 18-60% of control, whereas EGF internalization and degradation was normal. Sphingosine (40 microM), a protein kinase C inhibitor, increased EGF receptor affinity twofold in control cells and six- to nine-fold in cells of leprechaunism. However, sphingosine did not enhance EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation in either the controls or the patients' cells. By contrast, only one of the three cell lines of patients with the type A syndrome demonstrated a decrease in EGF binding and all demonstrated normal or near normal EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. These data indicate that in patients with leprechaunism, there are functional abnormalities of the EGF receptor, as well as of the insulin receptor, that may contribute to the severity of the syndrome. These data also suggest a role for the insulin receptor in maintaining normal EGF receptor function in these cells.\r"

Compared with the NaCl instillation, LTB4 caused a large increase in lavage total cells (NaCl = 6.8 +/- 1.0 X 10(6) vs. LTB4 = 26.4 +/- 5.0 X 10(6), P less than 0.01), most of which were PMN (NaCl = 12.2 +/- 4.6% vs. LTB4 = 55.7 +/- 6.0%, P less than 0.001). In contrast, there was only a small increase in lavage total protein, and the lavage total protein correlated weakly with lavage total cells and PMN. The production of superoxide anion by the lavage PMN in response to phorbol myristate acetate was similar to that of peripheral blood PMN. The migration of lavage PMN was normal toward the chemotactic peptide FMLP, but reduced toward LTB4 and zymosan-activated human serum. Morphometric analysis using transmission electron microscopy indicated a selective loss of small granules in the lung neutrophils as compared with peripheral blood neutrophils. The data indicate that in the normal human lung, LTB4 can recruit active PMN into the airspaces without causing a significant change in the protein permeability of the epithelial barrier.\r"

We recently observed a patient with propoxyphene overdose in whom marked QRS widening was reversed by lidocaine. The reversal is apparently paradoxical as both agents block the inward sodium current (INa). We examined possible mechanisms of the reversal by measuring INa in rabbit atrial myocytes during exposure to propoxyphene and the combination of propoxyphene and lidocaine (60 and 80 microM, respectively). Propoxyphene caused use-dependent block of INa during pulse train stimulation. Block recovered slowly with time constants of 20.8 +/- 3.9 s. Block during lidocaine exposure recovered with time constants of 2-3 s. During exposure to the mixture, block recovered as a double exponential. The half time for recovery during exposure to the mixture was 1.6 +/- .9 s compared with a half-time of 14.3 +/- 2.9 s during exposure to propoxyphene alone. During pulse train stimulation, less steady-state block was observed during exposure to the mixture than during exposure to propoxyphene alone when the interval between pulses was greater than 0.95 s. Both drugs compete for a common receptor during the polarizing phase. The more rapid dissociation of lidocaine during the recovery period leads to less block during the mixture than during exposure to propoxyphene alone. The experiments suggest a mechanism for reversal of the cardiac toxicity of drugs which have slow unbinding kinetics.\r"

  ".W": "Leukocyte-induced DNA damage may partially account for the known association between chronic inflammation and malignancy. Since elucidation of the chemical nature of leukocyte-induced DNA damage may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying leukocyte-induced DNA damage and the carcinogenesis associated with inflammation, the present study was undertaken to characterize the chemical modifications that occur in DNA exposed to stimulated human neutrophils. Calf thymus DNA was exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated neutrophils in the presence or absence of exogenously added iron ions. DNA samples were subsequently hydrolyzed, derivatized and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring. A variety of base modifications including cytosine glycol, thymine glycol, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine, 8-hydroxyadenine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine, and 8-hydroxyguanine were identified. The yield of these various base products was increased by the addition of iron ions. Specifically, in the presence of physiologic quantities of iron ions, approximately 7 of every 1,000 DNA bases were modified. Addition of the superoxide anion scavenger, superoxide dismutase, the hydrogen peroxide scavenger, catalase, the hydroxyl scavenger, dimethylsulfoxide, or the iron chelator, deferoxamine, to DNA mixtures containing PMA, neutrophils, and iron ions, greatly decreased the yield of the damaged DNA base products. Our results indicate that stimulated human neutrophils can damage each of the four bases in DNA. It is likely that hydroxyl radical, generated via an iron catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction, mediates neutrophil-induced DNA base damage, since: (a) the chemical structure of neutrophil-induced DNA base damage is consistent with a hydroxyl radical-mediated mechanism, (b) hydroxyl radical generated via ionizing radiation in aqueous solution produces DNA base modifications that are identical to neutrophil-induced DNA base modifications, (c) iron ions increase neutrophil-induced DNA base damage, and (d) iron chelators or scavengers of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl radical decrease neutrophil-induced DNA base damage.\r"

These agents included propylthiouracil (PTU) (300 mg/6 h X 5 d), dexamethasone (DEX) (2 mg/6 h X 5 d), and thyroxine (T4) (3.0 mg load and 0.3 mg/d X 5 d). [125I] rT3 clearance rates and rT3 production rates were then determined. Increased serum rT3 levels and rT3/T4 values occurred with both PTU and DEX as compared with control, while T4 increased serum rT3 but did so without changing rT3/T4 values. The rT3 clearance rate was significantly decreased by PTU without altering production rate, while DEX increased the rT3 production rate without altering the rT3 clearance rate. T4 administration did not change rT3 clearance but proportionately increased rT3 production. These responses indicate that circulating rT3 predominantly originates from a non-PTU inhibitable deiodinase enzyme system located in extrahepatic tissues. This enzyme system appears to have a high capacity and low affinity for T4 and can be stimulated by DEX administration.\r"

  ".W": "Using a [35S]methionine labeling/immunoprecipitation technique, we have previously shown that cultured skin fibroblast from three patients with short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency each synthesize a normal-sized (41 kD) variant SCAD in an amount comparable to that of normal cells. In the current study, these same cell lines were reexamined with immunoblot analysis. In one cell line (YH2065) no SCAD protein was detectable. In the other two deficient cell lines, the amount of variant SCAD was similar to, or only slightly less than, normal. These results suggested that SCAD-YH2065 is labile. In the pulse-labeling experiments, labeled SCAD was readily detectable for at least 30 h in a normal control and two other SCAD-deficient cell lines. In contrast, the labeled SCAD band in YH2065 cells was barely detectable at 6 h and undetectable at 20 h. [35S]Methionine-labeling in the presence of rhodamine 6G demonstrated that SCAD-YH2065 was synthesized as a 44-kD precursor and imported normally into mitochondria, as were the normal SCAD and two other variant SCADs, excluding the possibility that SCAD-YH2065 is a truncated precursor that cannot be imported into mitochondria. These results indicate that the mutations responsible for SCAD deficiency are heterogeneous, and emphasize the importance of using both radiolabeling and immunoblotting when evaluating such genetic defects at the protein level.\r"

  ".W": "Two polymorphic forms of Fc receptor III (FcR III) are expressed on human neutrophils. These differ with respect to their apparent molecular masses after digestion with N-glycanase, and with respect to their reactivity with MAb Gran 11 and alloantisera which recognize determinants (NA1 and NA2) of the biallelic neutrophil antigen (NA) system. To determine the molecular basis for this polymorphism we isolated RNA from neutrophils of NA1NA1 and NA2NA2 homozygotes and synthesized corresponding cDNAs. cDNAs encoding FcR III were then amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. The cDNA that encodes FcR III on NA1NA1 neutrophils differed from the cDNA that encodes FcR III on NA2NA2 neutrophils at five nucleotides, predicting four amino acid substitutions. As a result, NA1 FcR III has only four potential N-linked glycosylation sites as compared with six in NA2 FcR III. The amino acid substitutions and differences in the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites probably account for the different forms of neutrophil FcR III observed after digestion with N-glycanase and for the antigenic heterogeneity of this receptor.\r"

The patient's serum pattern precipitated multiple proteins keratinocytes antigens), but not the 130,000- and 85,000-dalton polypeptides characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris.

Compared with the younger patients ( less than 40 years), older patients (greater than or equal to 60 years) had superficial spreading melanomas that were, on average, of greater thickness, level, and diameter. Younger patients were more likely than older patients to show evidence that their melanomas arose from preexisting nevocytic nevi. There was no difference in the 10-year survival between groups when melanomas were matched by thickness. Thus it is as important to perform periodic total cutaneous examinations in the elderly as it is in younger persons, and age alone should not determine management strategies.\r"

The clinical symptoms fulfill many of the hallmarks of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II, including autosomal recessive inheritance, onset of symptoms in childhood, and mutilating acropathy. A high urinary excretion of sphingomyelin and lecithin suggests that the pathogenic mechanism may be a disorder of phospholipid metabolism.\r"

The diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by a strongly positive Mantoux test result (1:10,000 dilution) and by clearing of lesions after antituberculosis therapy. The histologic features were varied but were predominantly those of a vasculitis with a paraseptal and lobular panniculitis. Although it was not possible to fulfill the required criteria for diagnosing tuberculosis in these lesions, we believe there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the hypothesis that erythema induratum is a true tuberculid.\r"

New foci of leukoplakia, however, appeared in 10 patients after 3 months. Of the 16 patients who received acyclovir therapy, 12 had a clinical regression, although recurrences were noted in all patients after 3 months. Three patients had resolution of pain while taking acyclovir; in two the pain recurred after acyclovir was discontinued. No spontaneous remissions of the leukoplakia occurred in the 15 patients who refused therapy. We conclude that surgical excision is effective in patients with symptomatic oral hairy leukoplakia.\r"

Melanoma type and anatomic location were significant predictors of contiguous nevomelanocytic proliferations when considered alone. After adjustment, however, only melanoma type significantly predicted the presence of a contiguous histologic evidence of a precursor nevus than was nodular melanoma (odds ratio, 11.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 86.6) and were almost 22 times more likely to be associated with a nevus than was lentigo maligna melanoma (odds ratio, 21.45; 95% confidence interval, 2.8 to 162.4).

The Commission was directed to coordinate the Academy's diverse public and professional educational and screening activities related to skin cancer. Among the mandates of the Commission was the organization of a clearinghouse of current educational materials on skin cancer for health care providers and consumers. This complication is considered to be especially significant now because of increased effort by dermatologists to encourage physician visits and routine patient self-examination for early detection of skin cancer. The national and international campaigns to increase awareness of the harmful effects of the sun have generated much excellent educational information. Some audiovisual material, notably slide sets, will be especially helpful to meet increasing demand on dermatologists to present lectures to local consumer groups. This listing should facilitate ordering of these materials. Because of the lag time between preparation of this document and its publication, cost and availability data may have changed. The compilation will be updated periodically and printed in the Journal. The ongoing development of new educational materials requires continuous updating. It is hoped that readers who become aware of new relevant material will send this information to the author, in care of the Communications Division at the Academy offices in Evanston. International materials will be included in the next compilation.\r"

The stratum corneum of severely damaged skin was often compact and laminated, or gelatinous, and sometimes contained vesicles full of proteinous material. These vesicles arose from the enlarged and distinctly cellular-thick stratum lucidum. Sometimes there was no clear transition between the stratum lucidum and corneum. In the malpighian layer, cell heterogeneity, vacuolization, dysplasia, and zonal necrosis were common. The number of Langerhans cells was reduced in sun-damaged epidermis. The dermis had the usual disparate degrees of elastotic changes, with the formation of amorphous masses and the occurrence of fiber breakdown (fibrorhexis and fibrolysis). Macrophages among the elastotic masses contained coarse granules. When stained by means of the hematoxylin and Lee technique, the elastotic masses in the papillary dermis were pink or red but those in the mid dermis stained lilac to blue; all other elastic fibers stained pink or red. We found reticulin fibers predominantly around the elastotic masses and in areas of fibrorhexis and/or fibrolysis; a delicate collagenous fiber scaffolding supported the elastotic masses.\r"

Through the use of chart reviews and a retrospective questionnaire, various factors (sex, age, history of eczema/atopy, occupation) were examined in these two patient groups. Mycosis fungoides developed in 30% of the patients in the parapsoriasis group. Nineteen percent of patients in the mycosis fungoides group had worked in industry. Once the clinical diagnosis of mycosis fungoides was considered, an average of four biopsy specimens were needed to establish the diagnosis. The average interval from the initial visit to the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides from examination of biopsy specimens was 22 months. These findings support further the view that large plaque parapsoriasis represents an important precursor of mycosis fungoides. A designation of premycosis fungoides would emphasize this relation more than the term parapsoriasis.\r"

Most cells, including foam cells, showed a positive reaction for the macrophage marker MAC387. Diffuse, sparse T cells and focal perivascular B cell nodules were identified. Electron microscopic examination showed histiocytes and lysosome-rich cells with myelin bodies. All patients are alive and well. We believe that we have identified a form of adult subcutaneous xanthogranuloma syndrome that can be initially confusing and lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.\r"

  ".U": "90037785\r", 
  ".W": "Fifteen cases of cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia were studied immunohistologically with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies to determine their immunoarchitectural composition and to determine whether immunologic criteria recently proposed to identify lymphoma ever occur in benign skin lesions. All lesions were composed of T cells, polytypic B cells, macrophages, and Langerhans cells. Although only six cases containing lymphoid follicles were recognized in routinely stained sections, an additional five were identified in immunoperoxidase-stained sections. These follicles were of both the primary and secondary types and contained dendritic reticulum cell networks. The immunophenotypic features of these follicles were similar to those of reactive follicles in lymphoid organs and contrasted sharply with those reported previously for follicular lymphomas. Helper T cells were predominant in 11 cases. With regard to proposed criteria for T cell lymphoma, we did not detect loss of pan T cell antigens CD2, CD3, CD5, or BF-1, nor did we find populations of T cells with abnormal co-expression or loss of subset antigens such as CD4-8- or CD4+8+. Two cases in which relatively sparse infiltrates were present, however, were moderately CD7-deficient. This finding suggests that the CD7 criterion for cutaneous T cell neoplasia be modified in this situation. As observed previously, Leu-8 antigen deficiency was a common, nonspecific finding. With regard to proposed criteria for B cell lymphoma, we did not detect populations of B cells that were immunoglobulin-negative, nor did we observe preferential loss of one or more B-lineage antigens, histocompatibility complex-associated antigens, or lymphocyte function-associated antigens. We also did not identify any CD5+ B cells. On the basis of a comparison of our current data with prior studies of cutaneous lymphomas, we conclude that the immunologic findings recently proposed as general criteria for the differentiation of lymphoma from lymphoid hyperplasia are, in fact, applicable to cutaneous lymphoid lesions.\r"

Except for functional impairment of the lungs caused by an underdeveloped thorax that resulted from pressure of the thickened thoracic fascia, there was no involvement of the viscera or muscles and no immunologic abnormalities. The most important finding was markedly thickened fascia. This hereditary connective tissue disorder has all the characteristics of the tight-skin mouse.\r"

Circulating CD4+/CD8+ cell ratios were normal in five patients and reduced in one patient.

We present demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings of 50 patients with psoriatic erythroderma seen at our day-care center during a 9 1/2-year period. Precipitating factors included administration of systemic corticosteroids and the excessive use of topical steroids, phototherapy complications, severe emotional stress, and preceding illness. Treatment options are discussed on the basis of an average follow-up period of 34 months. There appears to be a certain subgroup of patients with highly unstable psoriasis for whom appropriately planned therapeutic regimens are essential.\r"

The cell/collagen-coated membrane was used to cover a superficially dermabraded vitiliginous area. Clinical repigmentation, though incomplete, was evident in three of four patients in 4 weeks. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were performed on the grafted areas (involved and uninvolved controls). These studies demonstrate the reappearance of melanocytes and melanosomes within the grafted area. All three patients who were successfully repigmented retained their pigment at 1 year follow-up. Further investigation of this promising treatment for vitiligo is warranted.\r"

Their application is a simple outpatient procedure involving no discomfort for the patient. In contrast to autografting, no biopsy is necessary, and growth of newborn keratinocytes in cultures is more rapid than that of adult cells. Use of cultured allogeneic cells offers immediate graft availability and the possibility of stockpiling and preserving the graft for future use. Cultured epidermal allografts may be valuable in accelerating healing by second intention in surgical wounds, as well as being a helpful addition to chronic ulcer management. In venous disease, the outcome is at least comparable to other forms of skin grafting. Ulcers due to connective tissue disorders fared less well and deep chronic ulcers (down to fascia or tendon) were not significantly improved by cultured allograft application. Surprisingly, patient age did not influence outcome.\r"

  ".W": "We report an ultraviolet B (UVB) protocol that achieves essentially complete depletion of Langerhans cells (LC) from human skin, while leaving the skin clinically intact. Sixteen human volunteers of skin types II and III were exposed to 144 mJ/cm2 of UVB each day for 4 successive days, on a 2-cm-diameter circle of buttock skin. In each case the irradiated skin showed redness and mild edema but no vesiculation or ulceration. One hour after the last exposure a 4-mm punch biopsy was taken from the center of the irradiated site. The epidermal sheet from each sample was separated and exposed to CD-1 antibody (12 samples) or HLA-DR antibody (4 samples) and the density of LC was assessed by immunofluorescence light microscopy. In each case the epidermal LC population was severely depleted to less than 20 cells/mm2, from a baseline of approximately 565 cells/mm2, and in many cases no morphologically normal LC remained. This simple protocol thus provides intact human skin completely depleted of LC. Such skin will provide an appropriate model for the in vivo study of the immune function in human skin deprived of its epidermal antigen-presenting capacity.\r"

Human in vivo 31P spectroscopy utilizing a skin coil designed in our laboratory can have clinical applications in cutaneous surgery and clinical dermatology, and will facilitate understanding of the pathophysiology of skin disease. In vitro experiments with fresh human skin indicate that complete utilization of phosphocreatine is followed by utilization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules during ischemia. These experiments also suggest that the majority of phosphocreatine in human skin is localized in epidermal and papillary dermis.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the relation between treadmill exercise testing and ambulatory St segment monitoring in the detection of ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease, and to assess whether standard medical therapy affects any such relation, 277 patients with stable angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease were studied with treadmill exercise testing and 48 h ambulatory ST segment monitoring. One hundred forty-six patients (52%) were studied while receiving no routine antianginal therapy, and 131 (48%) while receiving standard medical therapy. In 187 patients (67%) the exercise test was positive for ischemia. During 11,964 h of ambulatory monitoring, 881 episodes of ischemia (645 [73%] silent) were recorded, of which 809 (92%) occurred in patients with a positive exercise test. The mean heart rate at the onset of ischemic episodes during ambulatory monitoring was significantly less than that at the onset of 1 mm ST segment depression during exercise testing (94.5 versus 105.9 beats/min, p less than 0.0001). However, the frequency of ambulatory ischemic episodes was strongly related to a positive exercise test (p less than 0.001), and this relation was similar for both silent and painful ischemia (p less than 0.0001 for both) and in patients who were and were not receiving therapy (p less than 0.0001 for both). The total duration of ischemia was similarly related to a positive exercise test (p less than 0.0001). Only one patient with a negative exercise test had frequent (greater than 5/day) episodes of ischemia on ambulatory monitoring and had documented coronary artery spasm. Thus, exercise testing identifies the majority of patients likely to have significant ischemia during their daily activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The design was retrospective, with a 2 year mean follow-up period. The study group consisted of 1,747 predominantly male in-patients and outpatients referred for exercise testing at a 1,200 bed Veterans Administration hospital. The main result was that the mortality rate was significantly greater (p = 0.02) among patients with abnormal ST segment depression than in patients without ST depression. The presence or absence of angina pectoris during exercise testing was not significantly related to death. The prevalence of silent ischemia was not significantly different among patients categorized according to myocardial infarction or diabetes mellitus status, but was directly related to age. It is concluded that, in patients with an ischemic ST response to exercise testing, the presence or absence of angina pectoris during the test does not alter the risk of death. The prevalence of silent ischemia during exercise testing is not statistically different among patients with recent, past or no myocardial infarction or with insulin-dependent or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

The cold pressor test induced vasodilation of 8.9 +/- 5.7% in all 77 analyzed vessel segments of the group with normal arteries (p less than 0.01). In contrast, in patients with coronary artery disease, the 52 analyzed stenotic segments were constricted by -12.1 +/- 9.5% (p less than 0.01), the 57 analyzed vessel segments with luminal irregularities were constricted by -8.9 +/- 5.2% (p less 0.01) and 40 (85%) of 47 angiographically normal segments also were constricted by -7.0 +/- 4.9% (p less than 0.05). Preserved vasodilating capability was demonstrated by intracoronary nitroglycerin in all analyzed segments. In nine patients with normal coronary arteries, the analyzed vessel segments were dilated in response to both the cold pressor test and intracoronary acetylcholine by 10.9 +/- 5.4% and 13.4 +/- 4.7%, respectively. In contrast, in all 13 patients with coronary artery disease, vasoconstriction of identical vessel segments by -9.1 +/- 3.7% and -23 +/- 10.4%, respectively, was observed after both the cold pressor test and intracoronary acetylcholine. Intracoronary propranolol did not significantly affect either the vasodilative response in 11 normal coronary arteries (11.3 +/- 4.4% before and 8.6 +/- 4.3% after beta-blockade) or the vasoconstrictor response in 8 atherosclerotic coronary arteries (-11.4 +/- 4.6% before and -14.6 +/- 5.3% after beta-blockade). The dilation of normal and the constriction of atherosclerotic coronary arteries with cold pressor testing exactly mirror the response to the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine. Endothelial dysfunction in coronary atherosclerosis resulted in a loss of normal dilator function and permitted vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic stimulation. Thus, coronary vasomotion of large epicardial arteries in response to sympathetic stimulation by the cold pressor test in humans is intimately related to the integrity of endothelial function.\r"

We studied 83 consecutive patients treated with angioplasty of occluded (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial [TIMI] grade 0 or 1 flow) infarct-related arteries. Seventy patients had unsuccessful intravenous thrombolytic therapy and subsequently had rescue angioplasty and 13 patients had direct angioplasty without prior thrombolytic therapy. Forty-six patients had occlusion of the right coronary artery and 37 of the left anterior descending coronary artery. These two patient groups were similar with respect to age, percent of men, history of prior myocardial infarction, known cardiac risk factors and elapsed time from onset of chest pain to reperfusion. Angioplasty was initially successful in achieving TIMI grade 2 or 3 flow in 87% of right coronary artery occlusions and 92% of left anterior descending artery occlusions (p = 0.47). At 1 week follow-up catheterization, vessel patency was 63% for right coronary and 85% for left anterior descending infarct-related arteries (p = 0.03). Patients with right coronary artery occlusion had a higher incidence of life-threatening complications during angioplasty than did patients with left anterior descending artery occlusion (p = 0.002) including, respectively: 1) the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 16% versus 0% (p = 0.02), 2) sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation requiring electric cardioversion in 9% versus 3% (p = 0.33), and 3) sustained hypotension requiring inotropic agents or balloon pump therapy in 11% versus 3% (p = 0.16).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Surgical valve replacement was considered unsuitable in 79% of cases. A multiple balloon technique was utilized in 119 patients (95%). Valvuloplasty produced significant changes in peak pressure gradient (87 +/- 38 to 32 +/- 17 mm Hg), mean pressure gradient (70 +/- 26 to 30 +/- 13 mm Hg) and valve area (0.6 +/- 0.2 to 1.0 +/- 0.3 cm2). Complications included: in-hospital mortality in 10% (6 of 13 deaths in moribund patients), neurologic deficit in 3% and myocardial infarction in 2%. Arterial repair was required at 12 (4%) of 325 entry sites. Multivariate analysis identified severe congestive heart failure, preprocedure left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output as the only independent variables significantly affecting mortality. The cumulative probability of survival at 12 months was 62 +/- 6% and, excluding non-cardiac deaths, was 77 +/- 5%. At a mean of 12 +/- 4 months' follow-up, 55 of 72 patients were symptomatically improved; 10 patients with symptom recurrence underwent repeat valvuloplasty and 5 had valve replacement. Cardiac catheterization was repeated in 12 symptomatically improved patients, 9 of whom had valve restenosis. These data indicate that aortic valvuloplasty should be considered a palliative therapy for elderly patients with symptomatic calcific aortic stenosis who are poor surgical candidates.\r"

Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography was performed in all patients before and 24 h after valvuloplasty. In 19 patients (short-term group) repeat studies were performed at 3 (n = 2) and 6 (n = 17) months. Left ventricular relaxation, chamber stiffness and filling were assessed in 16 patients (immediate post-valvuloplasty group) before and immediately after valvuloplasty by simultaneous micromanometer left ventricular pressure tracings and echocardiograms. Immediately after valvuloplasty, relaxation was slightly impaired in the immediate post-valvuloplasty group, as reflected by the isovolumic relaxation time constant (56 +/- 26 to 68 +/- 39 ms; p less than 0.01) and maximal negative dP/dt (2,063 +/- 640 to 1,767 +/- 495 mm Hg/s; p less than 0.001). The chamber stiffness constants and diastolic filling dynamics were unchanged immediately after valvuloplasty. Twenty-four hours after valvuloplasty, patients without mitral regurgitation (n = 24) showed increases in the peak early filling velocity (72 +/- 31 to 83 +/- 28 cm/s; p less than 0.05) and peak early to atrial filling velocity ratio (0.8 +/- 0.6 to 1.0 +/- 0.7; p less than 0.05). However, in patients with mitral regurgitation (n = 20), the diastolic filling dynamics were not significantly changed. In the short-term group at the 3 to 6 month follow-up period, patients without mitral regurgitation (n = 12) showed striking increases compared with pre-valvuloplasty values in the peak early filling velocity (66 +/- 21 to 93 +/- 31 cm/s; p less than 0.02), peak early to atrial filling velocity ratio (0.6 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.4; p less than 0.02) and early time-velocity integral (9 +/- 4 to 16 +/- 6 cm; p less than 0.002). In patients with mitral regurgitation (n = 7) decreases occurred in the peak early filling velocity (123 +/- 32 to 106 +/- 28 cm/s; p less than 0.05) and peak early to atrial filling velocity ratio (1.5 +/- 0.7 to 1.1 +/- 0.6; p less than 0.05). Functional class in hospital improved after valvuloplasty (3.1 +/- 1.0 to 2.6 +/- 0.9; p less than 0.001) and correlated modestly with the percent decrease in Doppler-derived peak gradient (rs = 0.41, p less than 0.02) and mean gradient (rs = 0.36, p less than 0.05), but did not correlate with changes in aortic valve area, left ventricular ejection fraction or diastolic filling variables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Six orthotopic transplant patients (1.3 +/- 0.8 years postoperative) were age matched with six atropine-treated normal subjects. Simultaneous two-dimensionally targeted left ventricular echo-cardiograms and calibrated carotid pulse tracings were recorded. Left ventricular contractility was assessed with use of heart rate- and load-independent end-systolic indexes. Studies were performed at baseline and during dobutamine infusion with and without beta-adrenergic blockade with use of propranolol; effects were assessed during afterload changes generated by the alpha 1 agonist methoxamine. There were no differences in baseline contractility or reserve between transplant patients and normal subjects. The heart rate response to dobutamine was greater for transplant patients (p less than 0.001). In both groups, the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of dobutamine were ablated by propranolol. Dobutamine plus propranolol (unopposed alpha 1 effect) did not change mean systemic pressure in transplant patients while markedly raising mean systemic pressures in normal subjects (36 +/- 18 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). In addition, during initial challenge with methoxamine, the transplant patients required 60% more alpha 1 agonist than did the normal subjects (p less than 0.001) to obtain a pressor effect. In summary, transplant patients who were previously in severe heart failure have normal left ventricular inotropic response to beta 1 activation and blockade, exaggerated chronotropic response to dobutamine and reduced sensitivity to stimulation with alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists. These findings are consistent with a differential response of adrenoceptors to long-term stimulation after cardiac transplantation.\r"

To determine the changes in pulmonary hemodynamics after heterotopic cardiac transplantation, postoperative right heart pressures were serially measured in five patients who underwent this operation for end-stage congestive heart failure accompanied by severe secondary pulmonary hypertension and elevation in calculated pulmonary vascular resistance. Hemodynamics were compared with those of a matched group of 10 orthotopic cardiac transplant recipients. Preoperatively, pulmonary artery mean and wedge pressures, pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary pressure gradient (pulmonary artery mean minus wedge pressure) were significantly higher in the heterotopic group. Postoperatively, significant improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics occurred in both groups and, by 12 months, the pulmonary artery mean pressure, wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary pressure gradient were similar in the two groups. These findings suggest that pulmonary hypertension secondary to congestive heart failure, even when severe and associated with a high pulmonary vascular resistance, is to a great extent reversible.\r"

Before aneurysmectomy, 75 patients (Group 1) had no clinically recognized coronary disease, 47 patients (Group 2) had suspected or overt uncorrected coronary artery disease (history of prior myocardial infarction, angina or a positive stress test) and 9 patients (Group 3) had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty. The 30 day operative mortality rate was 3% (2 of 75) in Group 1 and 9% (4 of 47) in Group 2 (p = 0.15). According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, estimated survival 8 years after aneurysmectomy was 59% (expected rate 68%, p = 0.29) in Group 1 versus 34% (expected rate 61%, p = 0.01) in Group 2. The cumulative incidence rate of cardiac events at 8 years was 15% and 61%, respectively, for patients without and with suspected/overt coronary artery disease (p less than 0.01). Using multivariable proportional hazards analysis, uncorrected coronary artery disease was associated with a nearly twofold increased risk of death (hazard ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 3.00) and a fourfold increased risk of cardiac events (hazard ratio 3.71, 95% confidence interval 1.79 to 7.69). These population-based data support an aggressive life-long approach to the management of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the clinical value of transesophageal Doppler echography in the diagnosis of dissecting aortic aneurysm, both transesophageal and conventional echograms were performed in 22 cases of dissecting aortic aneurysm. Of the 22 patients, 17 underwent angiography; 8, X-ray computed tomography; 4, both; and 12, surgery. The performance of each method was assessed in the following four segments: A, ascending aorta; B, aortic arch; C, thoracic descending aorta; and D, upper abdominal aorta. The results by angiography were presumed to be correct. In the group of 17 patients who underwent angiography, the rate of correct detection of an intimal flap using the transesophageal approach was 100% in all four segments, significantly better than detection by the conventional approach (segment A, 65%; segment B, 47%; segment C, 35%; segment D, 53%) (p less than 0.01), and the rate of correct detection of the entry sites using the transesophageal approach was 100%, significantly better than that by conventional approach (42%) (p less than 0.05). X-ray computed tomography was not capable of detecting the site of entry in all cases. The presence of thrombus, aortic regurgitation and pericardial hemorrhage were all revealed clearly by the transesophageal approach, and the results were partly proved by other methods. In conclusion, transesophageal Doppler echography provides a rapid and accurate method of diagnosing and evaluating dissecting aortic aneurysm and permits prompt initiation of appropriate treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Tricuspid regurgitation severity was assessed preoperatively with Doppler color flow mapping and these assessments were compared with surgical findings in 90 patients undergoing mitral or aortic valve replacement, or both. Group I (n = 52) required tricuspid valve annuloplasty because tricuspid regurgitation was judged intraoperatively to be severe; in Group II (n = 38), tricuspid valve annuloplasty was not performed because tricuspid regurgitation was judged intraoperatively not to be severe. With use of the apical four chamber and parasternal short-axis imaging planes, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation by Doppler color flow mapping was assessed by comparing the maximal area of tricuspid regurgitant signals with the right atrial area taken in the same frame in which the maximal tricuspid regurgitant signals were noted. This ratio was found to be greater than or equal to 34% (mean 50.2 +/- 11.8%) in 50 (96%) of 52 patients in Group I and less than 34% (mean 27.5 +/- 6.9%) in 36 (95%) of 38 patients in Group II (p less than 0.001). The maximal diastolic tricuspid anulus diameter measured with the same two-dimensional imaging planes was greater than or equal to mm/m2 body surface area (mean 26.7 +/- 5.2 mm/m2) in 46 patients (88%) in Group I and less than 21 mm/m2 (mean 17.8 +/- 2.5 mm/m2) in 36 patients (95%) in Group II (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous coronary rotational angioplasty was attempted in 12 patients. The procedure was performed with a flexible rotating shaft with an abrasive tip, varying in diameter from 1.25 to 3.5 mm, tracking along a central guide wire. Among the 12 patients (mean age 58 years), 4 had a stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery and 8 a stenosis in the right coronary artery. After the guide wire crossed the stenosis, the abrasive tip was slowly advanced and several passes across the stenosis were made. The residual stenosis was measured with computerized automatic quantitative coronary angiography. Success was defined as a reduction of percent stenosis by greater than 20%. If residual stenosis remained significant (greater than 50%), the procedure was completed by balloon dilation. The device could not be inserted in 2 of the 12 patients. Five of the 10 patients underwent rotational angioplasty alone, and 5 had the procedure completed by balloon dilation. The stenosis was significantly enlarged from 0.56 +/- 0.31 mm to 1.26 +/- 0.28 mm. The outline of the vessel appeared smooth and regular. There were no complications related to the procedure and all patients were free of symptoms when discharged 2 to 3 days after the procedure. Thus, coronary rotational angioplasty is a simple and safe procedure allowing marked dilation of the narrowed segment. However, long-term follow-up is required for further evaluation.\r"

All patients had paroxysmal (seven patients) or chronic (three patients) atrial fibrillation and were referred for catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction. Treadmill exercise testing with measurement of expired gas exchange and respiratory flow was performed before ablation and 4 weeks after pacemaker implantation, with the pacemaker programmed to both the fixed-rate VVI and rate-modulating minute ventilation VVIR pacing modes in random sequence. The relation of pacing rate to oxygen consumption (VO2), expired carbon dioxide concentration (VCO2), respiratory quotient, tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute ventilation was determined during exercise in the rate-modulating minute ventilation pacing mode. Pacing rate was highly correlated with minute ventilation (r = 0.89), respiratory quotient (r = 0.89), VCO2 (r = 0.87), tidal volume (r = 0.87), VO2 (r = 0.84) and respiratory rate (r = 0.84). The mean exercise duration increased from 8.3 +/- 2.8 min in the fixed rate pacing mode to 10.2 +/- 3.4 min in the rate-modulating, minute ventilation mode (p = 0.0001). The maximal VO2 increased from 13.4 +/- 3.4 to 16.3 +/- 4.1 cc/kg per min (p = 0.0004).

The cohort was classified into two groups on the basis of survival at 3 months. Group 1 consisted of seven patients who died at less than or equal to 3 months of age, and Group 2 consisted of the nine surviving patients. Comparing Groups 1 and 2, the respective incidence rates of morphologic features that correlated with early death (p less than 0.05) included tethered distal attachments of the anterosuperior tricuspid leaflet (86% versus 11%), right ventricular dysplasia (86% versus 0%), left ventricular compression by right heart dilation (71% versus 11%) and the area of the combined right atrium and atrialized right ventricle being greater than the combined area of the functional right ventricle, left atrium and left ventricle (57% versus 0%) measured in the apical four chamber view. Right ventricular dysplasia was present in all patients with marked right atrial and atrialized right ventricular enlargement, in 86% of patients with tethered anterior leaflets and in 83% of those with left ventricular compression; 86% of patients with right ventricular dysplasia had tethered distal attachments. In conclusion, echocardiography defines morphologic features in the fetus and neonate that are highly predictive of death by 3 months of age.\r"

During the 35 month period ending in December 1987, 30 children, aged 14 days to 13 years, underwent balloon angioplasty of unoperated aortic coarctation, with a resultant reduction in mean coarctation gradient from 44 +/- 20 to 10 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). On the basis of results of 6 to 30 months' follow-up catheterization data in 20 children, the patients were classified into group A (13 patients with good results; gradient less than or equal to 20 mm Hg and no recoarctation on angiography) and group B (7 patients with fair or poor results; gradient greater than 20 mm Hg with or without recoarctation on angiography). Measurements of the aorta at five sites (the ascending aorta, isthmus, coarcted segment and descending aorta distal to the coarctation and at the level of the diaphragm) were made in two angiographic views, corrected for magnification and averaged. A standardized diameter of the aorta at the five locations was calculated for each case before angioplasty and at follow-up study, and variance of the diameter was then determined. The variance of standardized aortic measures (0.233 versus 0.287) was similar (p greater than 0.05) in both groups before angioplasty, whereas at follow-up study (0.057 versus 0.129) they were different (p = 0.01). There was a greater percent improvement at follow-up study (0.233 versus 0.057) in the group with good results than in the group with fair or poor results (0.287 versus 0.129).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "From September 1976 to August 1988, 205 patients with mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (Kawasaki disease) were evaluated; 29 were suspected of having coronary artery abnormalities because of either abnormalities on echocardiography (n = 21), congestive heart failure (n = 3), prolonged fever (n = 3) or cardiac arrest (n = 2). All 29 underwent cardiac catheterization and 22 were found to have coronary artery abnormalities. An additional 4 patients were diagnosed solely by autopsy; therefore, 26 patients (12%) in this series had coronary artery abnormalities. The clearance of contrast medium from the coronary arteries after aortography was significantly prolonged in patients with coronary artery aneurysms as compared with that in a control group (p less than 0.001). All patients exhibited delayed clearance of contrast medium on the initial aortogram as compared with that on follow-up studies (p less than 0.01). Of the 22 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery abnormalities, 19 had right and 20 had left coronary artery involvement; the majority had diffuse involvement of both vessels. In 15 patients who underwent follow-up catheterization 6 months to 7 years after initial study, complete resolution was observed in only 37% of affected coronary artery segments. In four patients, three of whom were asymptomatic, severely stenotic or occluded coronary artery segments were found on late catheterization. Coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in two of these patients. Echocardiography did not detect any of these stenoses. Although echocardiography is important for initial diagnosis and serial evaluation, angiography is essential to fully define the nature and extent of coronary artery lesions, particularly if stenosis is present.\r"

To assess the inotropic effect of nicardipine in humans independent of its vasodilator effect, equihypotensive doses of intravenous nitroprusside (mean infusion rate 65 +/- 13 micrograms/min) and nicardipine (mean dose 5.2 +/- 0.4 mg) were administered to 15 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV, radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction 0.15 +/- 0.02). Left ventricular micromanometer pressure and simultaneous radionuclide left ventricular volume were obtained at baseline, during nitroprusside infusion, during a second baseline period and during nicardipine infusion. Heart rate did not change significantly with either nitroprusside or nicardipine. Mean systemic arterial pressure decreased by an average of 21 mm Hg with both drugs. A greater decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure occurred with nitroprusside (27 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than with nicardipine (27 +/- 2 to 23 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased significantly only with nitroprusside. Cardiac index increased from 1.8 +/- 0.1 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 liters/min per m2 (p less than 0.05) with nitroprusside and to a greater extent from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.1 liters/min per m2 (p less than 0.01) with nicardipine.

These devices could be made even more acceptable if they were smaller, had increased longevity and the surgical procedure for implantation was less invasive. Reducing the energy requirements for internal defibrillation with use of a nonthoracotomy system would make all of these goals achievable. Monophasic and double and single capacitor biphasic waveforms were compared in 14 anesthetized dogs (25.5 +/- 2.2 kg) with use of a nonthoracotomy lead system that has previously been shown to distribute the delivered voltage throughout the heart more equally. Cathodal catheter electrodes were placed in the right ventricular apex and outflow tract. The anodal electrode was a large cutaneous R2 patch placed over the left side of the chest. The mean energy requirement for defibrillation when a single capacitor biphasic waveform was used was significantly less (6.4 +/- 2.6 J) than that for either the double capacitor biphasic or the monophasic waveform (18.0 +/- 8.0 and 17.4 +/- 8.0 J, respectively) of the same duration. Unexpectedly, the leading edge voltage for the phase I of the single capacitor biphasic waveform was significantly less (266 +/- 51 V) than that for either the double capacitor biphasic or the monophasic waveform (336 +/- 76 and 427 +/- 117 V, respectively). In conclusion, in large dogs, defibrillation is possible at low energy levels with a single capacitor biphasic waveform.\r"

Methoxamine (4 mg) increased the mean arterial pressure by 50 +/- 12% (mean +/- SE) (n = 5, p = 0.001). Phenylephrine (0.2 mg) increased mean arterial pressure by 82 +/- 14% (n = 5, p = 0.004). In protocol 2, isolated blood-perfused hearts were injected with incremental doses of these drugs in the ascending aorta in amounts approximately equal to the concentrations injected in the intact rabbits. Methoxamine (2 mg) reduced isovolumic peak systolic left ventricular pressure by 43 +/- 9% (n = 7, p = 0.003), whereas phenylephrine (0.1 mg) increased the isovolumic pressure by 24 +/- 9% (n = 7, p less than 0.05). These responses indicated an enhanced contractile state with phenylephrine and a reduced contractile state with methoxamine. Pretreatment with propranolol blunted the effect of phenylephrine on isovolumic pressure (n = 6, p less than 0.02). In protocol 3, cross-circulation experiments allowed study of the effect of these drugs on isovolumic left ventricular pressure in the isolated heart and simultaneously on the systemic arterial pressure in the intact anesthetized rabbit (support rabbit).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Left circumflex coronary artery occlusion was produced in anesthetized open chest dogs. Of 40 dogs studied, 22 were normotensive and 18 had chronic hypertension produced by a single kidney renal clamp procedure. Recordings of electrograms and extrastimulus testing were performed in endocardial and epicardial sites in both normal and ischemically damaged zones documented by triphenyltetrazolium chloride. In the hypertrophy group, there was greater endocardial to epicardial conduction delay in ischemic zones, mean +/- SEM 57 +/- 4 ms versus 31 +/- 2 ms in the normotensive group (p less than 0.05). Also, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was inducible in seven of eight dogs with hypertrophy and in none of eight normotensive dogs surviving to 3 h. Entrainment and several observations during induction were consistent with reentrant ventricular tachycardia. To exclude hypertension alone as an etiology of tachycardia, five normotensive dogs without inducible monomorphic tachycardia remained unchanged during hypertension produced with low doses of phenylephrine or descending aortic occlusion. Thus, the electrophysiologic response to ischemia is altered in hypertrophied myocardium, which predisposes to rapid sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of these descriptors of intracoronary thrombosis is associated with the syndrome of prolonged rest angina. The coronary angiograms of 50 patients with prolonged rest angina without myocardial infarction (group I) and 42 concurrent patients with stable angina (group II) were reviewed without knowledge of the clinical syndrome. Patients with prior myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery were excluded, as were patients with important aortic stenosis. Each coronary artery stenosis in a major epicardial vessel was evaluated for the presence or absence of intracoronary thrombus (defined using standard criteria), complex lesion morphology (defined as the presence of haziness, a smudged appearance or irregular lesion margins) and eccentricity, and the frequency of each of these findings in groups I and II was compared. Intracoronary thrombus was present significantly more often in group I patients (42%) than in group II patients (17%) (chi 2 5.77; p less than 0.02). Complex lesion morphology was also present significantly more often in group I (44%) than in group II (14%) patients (chi 2 8.17; p less than 0.01). Either standard criterion for intracoronary thrombus or complex morphology was present in 70% of group I but only 21% of group II patients (chi 2 19.7; p less than 0.001). These results support a strong association of the angiographic descriptors of intraluminal thrombosis with the clinical syndrome of prolonged rest angina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The utility of exercise echocardiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease has been demonstrated in populations consisting largely of men with a high prevalence of disease. To determine the diagnostic value of exercise echocardiography in women, 57 women who presented with chest pain were studied with coronary cineangiography and echocardiography combined with either treadmill (n = 38) or bicycle exercise (n = 19). Significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% reduction in luminal diameter) was present in 28 (49%) of 57 patients, including 16 (84%) of 19 who had typical angina, and 12 (32%) of 38 who had atypical chest pain. The overall sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography were both 86%. Exercise echocardiography correctly determined the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in 32 (84%) of 38 patients who had atypical chest pain and in 17 (89%) of 19 who had typical angina (p = NS). The exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) was nondiagnostic in 17 patients (30%) who had rest ST segment depression or ST depression with exercise that could also be induced by hyperventilation or changes in position. The correct diagnosis was made by echocardiography in 14 (82%) of 17 patients with a nondiagnostic exercise ECG. In conclusion, exercise echocardiography has a clinically useful level of sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary artery disease in women. The technique provides diagnostic information in women presenting with atypical chest pain and in those who have a nondiagnostic exercise ECG.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of the adenosine receptor blocker aminophylline on exercise capacity in patients with effort ischemia and documented coronary artery disease has been previously documented. In this study the effect of aminophylline on effort electrocardiographic (ECG) alterations and chest pain was tested in eight patients with syndrome X (anginal chest pain on effort, ischemic ECG changes during exercise, positive dipyridamole test, normal epicardial coronary arteries on angiography and absence of coronary spasm after ergonovine). After double-blind, randomized intravenous infusion of aminophylline (6 mg/kg body weight over 15 min) or placebo (20 ml of saline solution over 15 min), the eight patients with syndrome X underwent an upright bicycle exercise stress test on 2 consecutive days. After aminophylline, there was an increase in effort tolerance (aminophylline 7.7 +/- 1.2 min of exercise versus placebo 5.6 +/- 0.9, p less than 0.01) paralleled by an increase of the rate-pressure product (mm Hg x beats/min x 1/100) at 0.1 mV of ST segment depression or at peak exercise (aminophylline 278 +/- 55 versus placebo 230 +/- 24, p less than 0.05). Aminophylline provoked the abolition of ECG signs of ischemia in all eight patients. Thus, at a dosage that should effectively inhibit adenosine receptors, aminophylline infusion exerts a beneficial effect on exercise-induced chest pain and ischemia-like ECG changes in syndrome X. This effect occurs possibly through the prevention of myocardial flow maldistribution elicited by inappropriate adenosine release during effort in the presence of increased coronary resistance at the level of small intramural coronary arteries. This study, however, does not document the ischemic nature of effort-induced pain and ECG alterations in syndrome X.\r"

None of the patients had critical (greater than 50% luminal diameter reduction) organic coronary stenoses. Coronary diameters were measured by computerized quantitative arteriography during control, spontaneous spasm and ergonovine-induced spasm and after intracoronary nitrates were given. During spontaneous spasm, the luminal diameter of spastic and both proximal and distal nonspastic coronary segments was significantly reduced from control values, 64.2%, 13.2% and 14.8%, respectively. Average diameter reduction of unrelated arteries was 12.3%. Ergonovine, which was also administered to four patients, provoked focal spasm at the same site as spontaneous spasm. During intravenous ergonovine, luminal diameter of spastic segments was reduced by 91.5%, that of nonspastic proximal segments by 17.8% and that of nonspastic distal segments by 11.5%. Luminal diameter of unrelated arteries during ergonovine-induced spasm was reduced by 17.7%. Constriction of spastic segments was greater during ergonovine-induced spasm (p less than 0.05), whereas the extent of diameter reduction of nonspastic segments was not significantly different during spontaneous spasm and ergonovine-induced spasm. Intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate dilated spastic and nonspastic coronary segments to a similar extent from control (20.7%, 18% and 16.5%, respectively; p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities of skeletal muscle have been described in patients with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Eleven patients with dilated and eight with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without overt symptomatic skeletal myopathy underwent extensive neuromuscular studies. Quantitative electromyography showed abnormal reduction of motor unit potential duration, indicative of myogenic myopathy, in four patients (36%) with dilated and in three (37%) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Values were 21% to 40% (mean 28%) lower than those in age-matched normal control subjects. The presence of normal nerve conduction velocities and of normal motor unit fiber density in all patients indicated lack of neurogenic abnormalities. Skeletal muscle biopsy was performed in five patients with dilated and in four with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In all nine patients light and electron microscopy showed central hyporeactive cores, selective atrophy and mitochondrial abnormalities of type 1 fibers but not of type 2 fibers. The degree of impairment of left ventricular function in patients with electromyographic abnormalities was similar to that of those without (percent fractional shortening at two-dimensional echocardiography 21 +/- 9 versus 25 +/- 10, ejection fraction at angiography 39 +/- 13% versus 42 +/- 13% and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 21 +/- 6 versus 21 +/- 8 mm Hg) as well as symptom duration (9 +/- 4 versus 12 +/- 8 months). Thus, subclinical electromyographic alterations indicative of myogenic myopathy are frequent in patients with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and are unrelated to the degree of impairment of left ventricular function. The concomitant histologic alterations, characterized by selective type 1 atrophy, are similar to those observed in congenital and idiopathic myopathies, but different from those described in secondary heart failure.\r"

Patients in group 1 (n = 164) achieved adequate exercise end points, defined as positive exercise electrocardiograms or greater than or equal to 85% of maximal predicted heart rate. Patients in group 2 (n = 108) had submaximal exercise. The SPECT thallium-201 images showed perfusion defects in 74%, 88%, and 98%, respectively, of patients with one, two and three vessel coronary artery disease in group 1, compared with 52%, 84% and 79%, respectively, of such patients in group 2 (p less than 0.05). Perfusion defects showed partial or complete redistribution consistent with ischemia in 56%, 80% and 88%, respectively, of patients with one, two and three vessel coronary artery disease in group 1 compared with 35%, 58% and 56%, respectively, of such patients in group 2 (p = 0.08, less than 0.03 and less than 0.001, respectively). Of 58 patients with normal coronary angiograms or less than 50% diameter stenosis, 36 (62%) had normal SPECT images. In a separate group of 131 patients with less than 5% pretest probability of coronary artery disease, the specificity was 93%. The sensitivity of exercise SPECT imaging in group 1 was higher than that of ST segment depression (p less than 0.001). Thus, the level of exercise affects the results of SPECT thallium imaging in the localization and evaluation of the extent of coronary artery disease and the detection of ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to critically evaluate the usefulness of postexercise regional myocardial thallium-201 clearance for identifying disease in individual coronary arteries. Exercise and redistribution planar imaging studies were performed in 114 subjects, including 19 normal volunteers and 95 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization (70 with and 25 without greater than or equal to 50% narrowing in one or more coronary arteries). Thallium clearance was measured from predefined myocardial regions corresponding to the left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary arteries and was expressed as the percent decrease in activity at 4 h, assuming monoexponential clearance. In regions perfused by a normal or insignificantly diseased coronary artery, mean 4 h clearance was 58.9 +/- 9.4% for normal volunteers, 43.1 +/- 15.5% for catheterized patients without coronary artery disease and 36.3 +/- 24.9% for catheterized patients with coronary artery disease (p less than 0.001 patients with coronary artery disease versus normal volunteers). Clearance from normal regions was significantly associated with two measures of exercise performance: percent of predicted maximal heart rate achieved (r = 0.49) and exercise duration (r = 0.35). In regions perfused by a stenotic coronary artery, mean clearance was lower (31.1 +/- 19.8%) but was not significantly different from that in normal regions in the same patients. Clearance from diseased regions was also associated with maximal exercise heart rate (r = 0.28) and exercise duration (r = 0.41), but not with percent coronary artery stenosis (r = 0.02). After taking exercise performance into account, the number of diseased vessels or the presence or absence of disease in a given vessel had little influence on regional thallium clearance. Although measurement of regional post-exercise thallium clearance may help to identify stenotic coronary arteries in selected patients, variability related to exercise performance and other physiologic and technical factors greatly limits the clinical usefulness of absolute thallium clearance measurements.\r"

The 60 reports included 62 distinct study groups comprising 12,030 patients who underwent both tests. Both technical and methodologic factors were analyzed. Wide variability in sensitivity and specificity was found (mean sensitivity 81% [range 40% to 100%, SD 12%]; mean specificity 66% [range 17% to 100%, SD 16%]). All three variables found to be significantly and independently related to sensitivity were methodologic (the exclusion of patients with right bundle branch block, the comparison with another exercise test thought to be superior in accuracy and the exclusion of patients taking digitalis). Exclusion of patients with right bundle branch block and comparison with a \"better\" exercise test were both significantly associated with sensitivity for the prediction of triple vessel or left main coronary artery disease. Adjustment of exercise-induced ECG changes for changes in heart rate was strongly associated with the specificity for critical disease (partial R2 = 0.436, p = 0.0001).\r"

  ".W": "In animals, baroreflex sensitivity is inversely related to the likelihood of ventricular fibrillation during myocardial ischemia. After myocardial infarction in human patients, reduced baroreflex sensitivity is associated with increased mortality. A reduced standard deviation of normal RR intervals over a 24 h period is also associated with reduced survival after myocardial infarction. Therefore, 32 normotensive men who had survived their first myocardial infarction were studied to define the relation between baroreflex sensitivity assessed with phenylephrine injection and three Holter electrocardiographic measures of tonic vagal activity: the percent of successive normal RR intervals greater than 50 ms, the root mean square successive difference of normal RR intervals and the power in the high frequency energy of the normal RR interval power spectrum. Correlations among the Holter measures of heart period variability were greater than or equal to 0.94, indicating that these measures are so strongly correlated that any one of them can be used to represent the others. Baroreflex sensitivity showed weaker correlations with the three Holter variables (0.57 to 0.63), indicating that the Holter measures did not accurately predict baroreflex sensitivity. Baroreflex sensitivity showed a stronger correlation with the three Holter variables during the night than during the day. Baroreflex sensitivity and tonic vagal activity reflected by Holter variables were reduced more in patients with inferior myocardial infarction than in those with anterior infarction. The relative utility of baroreflex sensitivity and Holter measures of tonic vagal activity in predicting sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction needs to be evaluated in a large prospective study.\r"

  ".W": "Transmural myocardial infarction in dogs produces denervation of sympathetic nerves in viable myocardium apical to the infarct that may be arrhythmogenic. It is unknown whether sympathetic denervation occurs in humans. The purpose of this study was to use iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a radiolabeled guanethidine analog that is actively taken up by sympathetic nerve terminals, to image noninvasively the cardiac sympathetic nerves in patients with and without ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Results showed that 10 of 12 patients with spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias after myocardial infarction exhibited regions of thallium-201 uptake indicating viable perfused myocardium, with no MIBG uptake. Such a finding is consistent with sympathetic denervation. One patient had frequent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia induced at exercise testing that was eliminated by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Eleven of the 12 patients had ventricular tachycardia induced at electrophysiologic study and metoprolol never prevented induction. Sympathetic denervation was also detected in two of seven postinfarction patients without ventricular arrhythmias. Normal control subjects had no regions lacking MIBG uptake. This study provides evidence that regional sympathetic denervation occurs in humans after myocardial infarction and can be detected noninvasively by comparing MIBG and thallium-201 images. Although the presence of sympathetic denervation may be related to the onset of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias in some patients, it does not appear to be related to sustained ventricular tachycardia induced at electrophysiologic study.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, concern for the protection of health care employees and health care recipients has led to increasing awareness of transmitted infections. However, it is evident that damage of barrier methods of controlling infection can occur and go undetected. In a prospective study conducted from January 13, 1989 through February 15, 1989, 100 sequential pairs of gloves (200 gloves) worn during routine pediatric cardiac catheterizations were evaluated for punctures. A control group of 25 pairs of unused physicians' gloves was also evaluated for the presence of spontaneous leakage. In the 25 pairs of unused gloves (50 gloves), no punctures were detected, whereas in the 200 gloves worn during the catheterization procedures, punctures were found in 38 gloves or 19% (p less than 0.001). When comparing the frequency of punctures with respect to the digits, 81% of the punctures were detected within the thumb and index finger of the gloves. In the majority of instances, physicians describe stopcock manipulation as the cause of the punctures. Implication of the stopcock as a possible mechanism for glove damage can be isolated to the stop mechanism on the stopcock pivot. Although surgeons' gloves are worn in many procedures besides surgery, no previous studies have defined the incidence of glove punctures during these procedures. Recommendations include a redesign of the stopcock as a protective measure and immediate change of latex surgeons' gloves whenever damage is suspected.\r"

However, the clinical value of the nondipolarity of the QRST area map, a marker of nonuniform ventricular repolarization, has not been fully studied in myocardial infarction. The nondipolarity of the QRST area map (residue), the ratio of minimized deviation by an optimal dipole to the total measured potentials, was quantitatively studied in relation to susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction. The residue of the QRST area map was higher in 59 patients with myocardial infarction than in 44 normal subjects (25.0 +/- 9.0 versus 17.8 +/- 3.3%, p less than 0.01). Seventeen patients with ventricular tachycardia in the chronic phase (greater than 10 days) of myocardial infarction showed higher residue in their QRST area map (34.5 +/- 10.3%) than that in 29 patients without ventricular tachycardia throughout the study (22.7 +/- 6.7%) or that in 13 patients with ventricular tachycardia only in the acute phase (21.2 +/- 7.5%). QRST area maps with a residue greater than or equal to 25% (mean + 2 SD of normal subjects) identified patients with ventricular tachycardia in the chronic phase of myocardial infarction with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 71%. These results suggest that quantitative assessment of the nondipolarity of the QRST area map is clinically useful for identifying susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia in the chronic phase of myocardial infarction.\r"

In 24 of the 35 cases, absence of a significant left ventricular-aortic gradient (less than or equal to 10 mm Hg) was documented at initial cardiac catheterization. In 11 patients, a left ventricular-aortic pressure gradient was not obtained or not sought in the absence of clinical evidence of an obstructive lesion. In each case, discrete subaortic stenosis was not noted on angiography. Associated lesions included ventricular septal defect in 7, patent ductus arteriosus in 12, coarctation of the aorta in 8, pulmonary stenosis in 3, atrioventricular canal in 2 and miscellaneous lesions in 3 cases. The 35 patients had documentation of subvalvular aortic stenosis 3 months to 19 years after their initial study based on repeat catheterizations in 26, echocardiography in 6 or discovery at surgery in 3 cases. There were eight children with coarctation and no left ventricular-aortic gradient who developed significant subvalvular stenosis at a median of 2 years 9 months after initial cardiac catheterization. Of 30 patients with associated lesions, 23 had surgical intervention before development of subvalvular aortic stenosis, but only 5 of 17 patients with ventricular septal defect had surgical repair or palliation specifically for the interventricular communication before development of subvalvular aortic stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pulmonary to systemic flow ratio averaged 2.8 +/- 0.8 and right ventricular/left ventricular peak pressure ratio was 0.96 +/- 0.12.

On two separate days, 3 weeks apart, patients were administered either oral azelastine, 8.8 mg, or matched placebo. Four hours later they inhaled via nebulizer, a dose of allergen (grass pollen or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) that had previously been demonstrated to produce a 25% fall in FEV1. Plasma-histamine concentrations and FEV1 levels were measured at intervals during the subsequent 8 hours. After placebo, allergen inhalation produced rapid bronchoconstriction in all subjects with a maximum mean fall in FEV1 at 30 minutes of 22.8 +/- 3.4% from the postsaline baseline value. Five subjects also developed a late bronchoconstriction response with a fall in FEV1 of greater than 15% from postsaline baseline value between 2 and 8 hours after challenge. Azelastine reduced the bronchoconstrictor response during the first 10 minutes and produced a maximum mean fall at 30 minutes of 21.2 +/- 4.4% from the postsaline baseline value. Azelastine had a marked inhibitory effect, reducing the maximum mean fall from 23.9 +/- 6.3% to 9.6 +/- 3.9% from the postsaline baseline value. Analysis of the area under the FEV1 response time-course curves revealed that azelastine reduced the early response (first 2 hours) by 32.5% (p less than 0.05) (all subjects) and reduced the late response (2 to 8 hours) by 70.2% (p less than 0.05) (n = 5).

Retrospective studies have indicated that patients segregate into two categories based on skin test reactions: single positive skin test to MC only and multiple positive skin tests. These two populations differed in age, personal and family history of atopy, levels of both IgE and total MC-specific IgE (sIgE), and symptomatology. It has been speculated that the subjects with only a single positive skin test may actually be nonatopic and develop an IgE response to MC because of some peculiarity of the antigen. In a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we tested the efficacy of immunotherapy (IT) with MC extract in 51 subjects, 12 single positive skin tests and 39 multiple positive skin tests, to determine if these differences indeed exist and if IT is equally effective in both groups. We failed to demonstrate significant differences in age, sex, MC sIgE, total IgE, initial immediate cutaneous response, initial late cutaneous response, or personal or family history of atopy. IT was equally effective in both groups of subjects with no significant differences noted in response to MC sIgE, MC sIgG1, MC sIgG4, or with suppression of the late cutaneous response. In addition, we found that suppression of the late cutaneous response correlated significantly with cumulative dose of MC extract, postseasonal level of MC sIgG1 and MC sIgG4, and improvement of symptomatology. Suppression of the late cutaneous response may be a clinically useful parameter to follow in monitoring patients during IT. Caution is advised because this procedure may result in systemic reactions.\r"

However, extensive immunologic cross-reactivity was demonstrated among legume antigens on Immunoblot and Immunodot-blot analyses and prick skin tests. The proteins of six legumes (peanut, soybean, lima bean, pea, garbanzo bean, and green beans) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with sera from six legume-allergic patients. Multiple IgE-binding bands were identified in each legume lane by the sera from each of these legume-allergic patients. In vitro cross-reactivity did not correlate with clinical hypersensitivity. All the legumes studied (except green bean) had a prominent band at 20 kd. Numerous proteins and protein subunits can be identified in each of the legumes (16 peanut, 21 soybean, 23 lima bean, 25 pea, 22 garbanzo bean, and 11 green bean protein bands) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it appears that legume-allergic patients' sera may recognize multiple similar fractions from each legume. A second in vitro test was performed in which the six legume extracts were bound directly onto nitrocellulose paper. These \"legume\" Immunodot blots were probed for specific IgE-binding activity with sera from 62 patients with positive legume prick skin tests. The legume Immunodot blots again demonstrated extensive clinically irrelevant cross-reactivity. However, this test may prove useful as a simple technique for screening food-specific IgE with minimal quantities of sera.\r"

Atopic children and young adults living in houses with high levels of Der p I and Der f I (greater than or equal to 2000 ng/gm of dust) were found to have significantly higher serum IgE levels to Dpt and Df (p less than 0.0001) compared to patients with low mite-allergen exposure. Washed leukocytes of 55 atopic children and 14 control subjects were investigated for in vitro histamine release to serial dilutions of Der p I; 86% of highly exposed (greater than or equal to 10,000 ng/gm) children demonstrated positive histamine release in response to Der p I compared to 17% in the group with very low exposure (less than 400 ng/gm). There was a positive correlation between basophil sensitivity (rs = 0.6; p less than 0.0001) and reactivity (rs = 0.54; p less than 0.0001) to Der p I and mite-allergen exposure. The relative risk for sensitization in the highly exposed group versus the group with very low exposure was sevenfold to 32-fold increased. We conclude that high concentrations of mite allergen (greater than or equal to 2000 ng/gm) increase the risk of specific sensitization in atopic children and young adults and thus may facilitate allergic airway disease.\r"

Varying but small numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, and plasma cells were found in patients and healthy subjects. The possible role of CD4+, CD8+, and HLA-DR+ cells in the nasal mucosa is discussed with regard to the pathogenesis of nasal polyps.\r"

Both patients had low serum immunoglobulin levels, low peripheral B cell and T4 subclass of lymphocytes, and reversed T4/T8 ratio. One of the patients had excessive suppressor activity. Two of the asymptomatic members of the family (the father and one brother) had also low T4/T8 ratio that was not associated with excessive suppressor activity. No linkage between the disease inheritance to HLA could be observed. A study of the T cell helper activity to an antigen, the response to which is regulated by an HLA-linked gene, suggested a defect in the immune response of the two patients and their asymptomatic brother with immunologic disorders. Treatment with cimetidine of the patient with excessive suppressor activity led to an improvement in his clinical state, reduction in suppressor activity, temporary effect on his proliferative response capacity to mitogens, and an increase in the antigen-specific helper activity.\r"

There was a significant release of histamine and leukotriene E4 into the BAL fluid in all the patients after challenge. Inhalation challenge with methacholine in six patients with nonoccupational asthma and inhalation challenge with plicatic acid in two subjects without asthma did not result in the release of mediators in the BAL fluid. These studies provide direct evidence that plicatic acid-induced bronchoconstriction was accompanied by increased levels of histamine and leukotriene E4 release, whereas a nonimmunologic induction of bronchoconstriction did not induce such local mediator release. BAL may provide a useful means of studying the pathogenesis of occupational asthma caused by exposure to low-molecular-weight compounds.\r"

BHR (provocative dose of methacholine, less than or equal to 7.8 mumol, causing a 20% fall in FEV1) was present in 125 children (25.3%). Atopy (skin wheal, greater than or equal to 4 mm diameter) was present in 157 children (32%). BHR associated with atopy demonstrated a constant age-related frequency in the 7- to 15-year-old children that was influenced by a family history (FH) of asthma (FH, 50%; no FH, 34%; p = 0.051). BHR not associated with atopy demonstrated a marked decreasing frequency with age from 25% in 5- to 7-year-old children to 3% in 13- to 15-year-old children and was uninfluenced by an FH of asthma. We conclude that the differences in the frequency of BHR with age, together with the genetic influence on BHR associated with atopy, compared with the findings in nonatopic children, indicate distinct heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of BHR in these Tokelauan children. These differences may be important for understanding the relationships between nonspecific BHR, atopy, and asthma in children.\r"

HRA-N caused dose-related histamine release from human basophils (5% to 22% net) and from isolated human cutaneous mast cells (3% to 28% net). Equivalent amounts of histamine were released from human basophils, RBL cells, and cultured mouse P cells exposed to HRA-N (16.3 +/- 3.4%, 12.2 +/- 1.2%, and 15.5 +/- 2.5%, respectively; p was not significant). Intradermal injections of HRA-N also caused chlorpheniramine-inhibitable blueing in vivo in rat and guinea pig skin. In general, supernatants that were active on RBL cells also induced histamine release from human basophils, although the magnitude of response to individual HRA-N preparation varied among basophil donors. HRA-N is stable to boiling and filters at a molecular weight greater than 1000 daltons. Boiling enhances HRA-N, suggesting the presence of a heat-labile inhibitor of HRA-N. These data suggest that HRA-N is a heat-stable factor that causes histamine release from human basophils and human cutaneous mast cells, that HRA-N is active across species lines both in vivo and in vitro, and that HRA-N acts maximally to induce histamine release under physiologic conditions.\r"

Occasionally, other diagnostic procedures are required. The diagnosis is often difficult in domestic exposures, such as humidification and air conditioning systems. A careful environmental history is essential, and at times the physician must inspect the patient's environment personally. In most cases, the diagnosis is established if (1) the history and physical findings and pulmonary function tests indicate an interstitial lung disease, (2) the x-ray film is consistent, (3) there is exposure to a recognized cause, and (4) there is antibody to that antigen. In other exceptional circumstances, bronchoalveolar lavage may help. Biopsy is rarely needed. Special environmental studies and identification of new antigens require research facilities. Provocation tests are research procedures, not necessary for the diagnosis, and not needed in contested workmen's compensation adjudications.\r"

Findings from a survey of a sample of entry-level Plan IV/V Programs, Coordinated Programs in Dietetics, and dietetic internships randomly selected from The American Dietetic Association's 1988 Directory of Dietetic Programs indicate that the growth and development of handicapped infants and their nutrition care are underexposed in most didactic and experiential components of the education of entry-level dietitians. A working group of nine nutritionists with expertise in both dietetic education and nutrition care of handicapped children met at a national conference and recommended competencies that they thought would enable entry-level registered dietitians to join interdisciplinary teams working with handicapped infants and their families. Registered dietitians on the team that prepares the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) can strive to ensure that infants are well nourished and therefore more responsive to the other therapies proposed in the plan.\r"

Mean daily dietary intakes were well below the RDAs for folacin (76% RDA), magnesium (81%), iron (59%), and zinc (48%). In addition, more than one-third of the cyclists failed to consume 67% of the RDA for the following micronutrients: pyridoxine, folacin, cobalamin, vitamin E, magnesium, iron, and zinc. Hemoglobin (135 gm/L), hematocrit (0.39), and albumin (45 gm/L) values were all normal, although most hemoglobin values were in the lower 50% of normal range. Foods such as meats, poultry, fish, beans, peas, and nuts were low or absent from the diets of most athletes.

Demographic information and responses to a shortened version (36 items) of the National Dairy Council's Nutrition Achievement Test 4, developed for junior and senior high school students, were obtained from 205 male recruits. Although nutrition knowledge among Navy recruits was relatively comparable with that of U.S. school students, findings indicated that nutrition education is indeed needed. Only 2% of recruits answered 90% of the questions correctly. Forty percent answered half or more of the nutrition questions incorrectly. Questions answered incorrectly by more than 50% of recruits involved: (a) how one assesses nutrient needs and whether those needs are being met, (b) the four major food groups and recommended servings, and (c) effects of alcohol and drugs on nutritional status. Recruits who received higher grades in high school, got into less trouble in high school, were older, and were Caucasian had higher nutrition knowledge. Detailed information regarding nutrition misconceptions should help the Navy develop focused nutrition education materials.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to identify the research activities that were part of dietetic internship and coordinated undergraduate programs. Data about required research courses, research-related experiences, curriculum competencies, student publications, and faculty needs were obtained from 79 dietetic internship and 46 coordinated undergraduate program directors. Research courses were required in 60% of the programs and most often included basic statistics and review of the literature. Attendance at research conferences and observation of research dietitians were the most frequent learning experience activities. A wide variety of research projects were required by 71% of the programs, but there were few student opportunities to participate in faculty-sponsored research. The ability to evaluate literature critically, knowledge of research concepts, and application of research findings to dietetic practice were the most frequently cited competency statements. Less than 2% of graduates in a 3-year period had published in professional journals. Faculty members believed they needed more time, money, educational materials, professional development, and access to research facilities to improve the research component of the program. These findings suggest that research competencies may need to be prioritized differently in view of changing needs in dietetic practice.\r"

  ".W": "Improvements in diabetes knowledge, psychosocial functioning, and metabolic control were assessed following a six-week diabetes education program for older male patients (aged 65 to 82 years) and their spouses. Before and after the program, scored questionnaires were administered to patients and their wives regarding knowledge, quality of life, stress, family involvement in diabetes care, and patient involvement in social activities. The patients were again assessed six months later. Results were compared to those of younger adult male patients (aged 28 to 64 years). The older patients significantly increased their knowledge of diabetes (P less than .05), and to an extent equal to that of younger individuals. Reduction in stress correlated with their increase in knowledge (r = 0.9; P less than .05) and their improved diet-related quality of life (r = 0.7; P less than .02). A decrease in stress was still evident six months after the program P less than .01). Perceived quality of life for areas requiring greater life-style modification (diet and exercise) increased (P less than .01), and was maintained at six months. In contrast, younger patients reported decreases in perceived quality of life (P less than .05). Older patients with participating spouses, compared to those without, showed greater improvement in knowledge (P less than .02), increase in family involvement (P less than .05), less stress (P less than .02), and improvement in metabolic control of diabetes (P less than .001). The program increased spouses' knowledge and perceived involvement in the care of their diabetic partners (P less than .01). This study suggests that diabetes education is an effective intervention for elderly patients and their spouses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
