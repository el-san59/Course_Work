  ".W": "A new method of water nebulization for high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) using a coaxial saline infusion is described. A bench study was performed to investigate how alteration of the HFJV variables affects humidity using this method of humidification. The variables examined included the water flow rate (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 ml/min), cannula OD 2.1 mm (14 ga) and 1.4 mm (17 ga), ventilation rate (60, 80, 100, and 120 beat/min), inspiratory/expiratory (I/E) ratio (0.25, 0.67, and 1.5), and driving pressure (600, 900, 1200, and 1500 torr). Increasing water flow rate increased humidity. Humidity decreased with increased driving pressure, I/E ratio, and cannula OD. Humidity is not much affected by ventilation rate.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that large-bore iv tubing sets provide greater in vitro flow rates than conventional sets currently utilized for the administration of normal saline. The study was conducted in two parts. First, flow rates were measured using a conventional iv tubing set under gravity and 300 mm Hg of pressure, and four large-bore iv tubing sets under gravity. Additional measurements were made after attaching various catheters and sheaths ranging in size from 14 ga to 9 Fr. Five trials were conducted for each combination. Second, we measured the amount of time taken in a mock drill by 28 randomly chosen anesthesiology residents and staff to load a unit of packed RBC into a pressure infusor bag, inflate to 300 mm Hg, and deflate to ambient pressure. Data were analyzed for individual tubing sets as a whole and individual catheter-tubing set combinations, using the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni adjustment. Statistically significant (p less than .03) differences in flow rates were noted between the conventional set under gravity compared with both the pressurized conventional set and the large-bore tubing sets under gravity. There was no statistical difference in flow rates between pressurized conventional iv sets and large-bore iv sets. Mean time necessary for the 28 anesthesiology staff and residents to pressurize and deflate a conventional tubing set was 65 sec/bag of packed RBC. We conclude that a considerable amount of time can be saved by utilizing large-bore iv tubing sets instead of conventional pressurized sets during massive volume resuscitation. Clinical trials are indicated to corroborate these results.\r"

Of 2420 patients registered in New Zealand (1968 to 1970), 131 were under 40 years of age and 2289 were over 40 years of age. The annual average incidence of treatable colorectal cancer in patients under 40 years of age was 2.36 per 100,000 and 82.93 in patients over 40 years of age. There were predominantly more females in both age groups with colonic tumors, 50:44 (female:male), and 759:652 (female:male). The rectal tumor male-to-female ratio of 1:0.68 in those over 40 years of age was reversed in those under 40 years of age (1:2.08). There was no significant difference in the subsite distribution of colorectal cancer between the two groups. There was a higher proportion of Stage 1 tumors in those under 40 years of age and a correspondingly higher proportion of Stage 2 tumors in those over 40 years of age. The overall crude and relative five-year survival rates for patients under 40 years of age were both 60 percent, whereas the crude rate for older patients was 42 percent, with a corresponding relative rate of 53 percent. Ten-year survival rates were generally higher in younger patients. From this study, there was no evidence to suggest that younger patients (less than 40 years old) with colorectal cancer had worse prognoses and did not survive as long as older patients (40 years and over).\r"

Duration of treatment ranged from one week to 66 months (median, 12 months).

In Group II, steroids were withdrawn or reduced in 12 (63 percent) patients and three patients required colectomy. Side effects necessitating withdrawal of azathioprine occurred in 12 patients (hematologic effects, 6 patients; gastrointestinal effects, 4 patients; other effects, 2 patients). Two patients required a reduced dose of azathioprine because of leukopenia. The authors conclude that azathioprine is a valuable therapeutic option in selected patients with ulcerative colitis.\r"

To this end, the topographic relations of the rectosigmoid junction were investigated in specimens from 39 human cadavers. Although these relations varied, in all cases the rectosigmoid was located intraperitoneally and was distal to the promontory of the sacrum. Examination of muscle specimens under the dissecting microscope revealed conspicuous bands of longitudinal fibers, with curved interconnections between the longitudinal and circular muscle coats. The rectosigmoid junction is not a true sphincter, although in functional terms it can be regarded as such.\r"

Temporary ileostomy may, however, be a source of significant complications. The first 21 patients in the authors clinic were operated upon using covering loop ileostomy in ileoanal operations. These patients had no anastomotic or pouch complications, but there were complications, especially with the closure of the ileostomy. Therefore, a trial of one-stage operations in ileoanal anastomosis was started. Ileoanal anastomosis without ileostomy was performed on 25 consecutive patients. All the patients were operated upon for ulcerative colitis. There was one patient with pelvic abscess who needed diverting ileostomy. Thus, the early failure rate in patients operated upon without ileostomy was 4 percent. There were many other complications among these patients, but no other relaparotomy was needed. The complication rate was not different in patients operated upon without ileostomy compared with the authors first 21 patients operated upon with ileostomy (60 and 52 percent, respectively). Patients with one-stage operation needed a significantly shorter mean hospital stay than patients with two-stage operation (13.6 days and 25.3 days, respectively; P less than 0.001). The use of corticosteroids appears not to be a contraindication for one-stage operation, because there were significantly more patients using corticosteroids in the one-stage group compared with the two-stage group (92 and 62 percent, respectively; P less than 0.05).\r"

The population was broken down into two groups, one group that had polyps at the second examination and one group that did not. This study determined which factor(s) were significant among this population in distinguishing whether new polyps would be found at one year follow-up. The authors found that among the many variables studied, only polyp multiplicity was significant in predicting polyp recurrence. More than one polyp found at index colonoscopy led to a significant chance of having a new polyp after only one year. Also, it was demonstrated that these \"new\" polyps were unlikely to have been \"missed\" polyps from the initial colonoscopy. Because of the shifting location, smaller size, and fewer instances of histologic atypia in these polyps compared with those at index examination, the authors believe that polyps found after one year may be assumed to have arisen de novo. Finally, the authors show that a significant number of polyps occur beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscope (approximately 60 cm). The authors recommend that patients who have polyps undergo a colonoscopic examination. When patients are re-evaluated after having colonoscopic neoplastic polypectomy, they should undergo repeat colonoscopy.\r"

Nine patients are presented who had severe perianal Crohn's disease, which eventually required abdominoperineal excision of the anorectum. In all nine patients, it was secondary manifestations of anal Crohn's disease that precipitated proctectomy, such as high fistulas, strictures, and rectovaginal fistulas. These secondary phenomena, especially fistulas caused by cavitating ulceration, become self-perpetuating by the mechanical effect of feces being forced into the tract. During the same period, 17 patients required rectal excision by abdominoperineal resection, where perianal disease was incidental to severe colorectal disease. There is a tendency for excessive delay before advising surgery for severe perianal disease. An attempt should be made to identify patients with a poor prognosis to avoid unnecessarily prolonged morbidity. Assessment of the exact nature of the anal lesion and assessment of Crohn's disease activity are important in making this decision.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic resection is the only curative therapy currently available for colorectal cancer metastases to the liver. However, concern over high morbidity and mortality of the procedure has limited referral of patients for resection. The authors report on 58 patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal metastases at the National Cancer Institute between the years 1976 and 1985. Thirty-two patients underwent a major hepatic resection, and 26 patients underwent one or more wedge resections. Mean anesthesia time was 448 minutes, mean estimated blood loss was 3663 ml, and mean hospital stay was 17.5 days. Operative mortality was 3 percent, and morbidity was 62 percent. Using a grading scale for complications, 24 percent of patients had inconsequential complications, 16 percent had moderate complications, and 19 percent had severe complications. Complications were clearly related to extent of procedure. Factors that correlated best with morbidity were high blood loss and trisegmentectomy. The authors conclude that while hepatic resection can carry a high morbidity, much of this morbidity is minor and operative mortality is low. Recent improvements in anesthesia, improved resection technique, and a better understanding of hepatic anatomy have made possible correspondingly lower morbidity and mortality rates. Careful selection of patients can make hepatic resection a safe procedure.\r"

Physiologic testing demonstrated improved sensation in those patients with a preserved anal transition zone. Functional results were not significantly improved, although there was a trend toward improved continence and discrimination in those with the anal transition zone preserved. Although the results are early and are not conclusive from the clinical standpoint, they are certainly encouraging and may justify continued use of this technique.\r"

Using both methods, rectal sensation was assessed in 13 healthy control women and 26 women with severe idiopathic constipation. Balloon distention in the rectum revealed an elevated sensory threshold (16.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 30.4 +/- 3.1 ml air, controls vs. patients, P = 0.018) and volume required to elicit a call to stool (61.1 +/- 9.1 vs. 97.5 +/- 6.4, P = 0.003) in subjects with severe constipation. The maximum tolerated volume was similar in the two groups. Rectal mucosal electrosensitivity was then tested using a bipolar ring electrode supplying a constant current. This demonstrated an elevated sensory threshold in the constipated subjects (16.3 +/- 3.0 vs. 27.4 +/- 2.1 mAmps, P = 0.005). There was a significant correlation between the sensation thresholds for balloon distention and electrical stimulation for the entire subject group (r = 0.39, P = 0.01). Two other patients with severe constipation after suspected extrinsic nerve damage were also studied and demonstrated a markedly abnormal electrical sensory threshold. Electrical testing avoided the variables inherent in balloon distention and was well tolerated, accurately quantifiable, and reproducible. The raised threshold to electrosensory mucosal testing suggests the presence of a rectal sensory neuropathy in patients with severe idiopathic constipation.\r"

At admission, the ulcer was painless, measuring 4 to 5 cm in diameter and showing detachment and a slightly papillomatous aspect at the edge but without induration of the base. Microscopic examination revealed cutaneous ulceration with a well-developed inflammatory response, a few small vessels with intraluminal thrombosis or necrotizing walls, and isolated microscopic granulomata. No infectious disease was detected. The diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis was made six months later, when the disease was clinically evident in three principal sites: upper airways, lung, and kidney. At that time, serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies were detected with indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. There has been an excellent response to immunosuppressive therapy. Review of the literature revealed no similar reports.\r"

Chronic indwelling catheters were inserted into the external jugular vein (EJV) or the hepatic portal vein (HPV) and attached to osmotic minipumps, which were used to infuse pulses of ovine (o) PRL (4/day of 2 h each, total dose = 20 micrograms/day) for 14 days. The rats were hypophysectomized 2 days after catheterization, and given daily sc injections of estradiol + progesterone in oil (2 micrograms and 5 mg/day, respectively) plus twice daily ip injections of porcine GH (50 micrograms/injection) from days 2-13. They were killed on day 14. Controls received the sc and ip hormone injections but were given solvent infusion into the EJV or the HPV instead of oPRL. Infusion of the oPRL into the EJV did not promote mammary L-A growth more than did infusion of solvent into either the EJV or the HPV. By contrast, infusion of the same dose of the hormone into the HPV caused a significant stimulation of the L-A growth. Serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels were measured by RIA in the rats given the same hormone injections with either intrahepatic infusion of solvent or oPRL, but terminated 7 days after the start of infusion. Intrahepatic delivery of oPRL was not more effective at elevating serum IGF-I concentrations than was the infusion of solvent. These results indicate that the liver may participate in the mammotrophic actions of PRL and serum IGF-I is not responsible for this effect.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the bombesin-like peptides, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin-C (NMC), and the ranatensin-like peptides, neuromedin-B (NMB), neuromedin-B30 (NMB30), and neuromedin-B32 (NMB32), on pituitary GH and PRL release was studied in perifused anterior pituitary aggregate cell cultures from 9- to 12-week-old male rats cultured in serum-free defined medium supplemented with 0.05 nM T3 and 4 nM dexamethasone (DEX). All peptides stimulated PRL and GH release. GRP and NMC stimulated hormone release in a concentration-dependent manner between 0.1-10 nM. NMB was slightly more potent than NMB30 and NMB32, but was significantly less potent than GRP and NMC. The magnitude of the PRL response to GRP and NMC inversely correlated with that of the GH response. Cultures with relatively low PRL response levels displayed high GH responses, whereas the opposite was found in cultures with high PRL response levels. The stimulatory actions of GRP, NMC, and NMB were blocked by the bombesin receptor antagonist Leu13 psi (CH2NH) Leu14-bombesin, supporting the specificity of the findings. Addition of 1 nM estradiol (E2) to the culture medium provoked an impressive (4- to 10-fold) increase in the magnitude of the GH response to NMC without changing the EC50 value (0.5 nM). In contrast, E2 significantly decreased the stimulation of GH release by rat GH-releasing factor. In the E2-treated aggregates 3 nM NMC stimulated GH release to a comparable extent as 0.1 nM GRF. 5 alpha-Dihydrotesterone (10 and 100 nM) and DEX (80 nM) also enhanced the GH response to NMC, but to a much smaller extent than E2. E2 had also a stimulatory effect on the PRL response to NMC, particularly in cultures with a low intrinsic PRL response. The PRL response to NMC was decreased by DEX and slightly augmented by 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. It is concluded that bombesin- and ranatensin-like peptides have a stimulatory effect on GH and PRL release at the pituitary level. Since their action on GH release is strongly potentiated by E2 and much less so by glucocorticoids, these peptides clearly distinguish their activity and specificity from that of the protagonist releasing factor GH-releasing factor, suggesting a role in sex-related differences in GH release or in the control of GH secretion during sexual maturation.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were directed toward understanding the cellular actions of inhibitor drugs that affect steroidogenesis and cholesterol transport. We investigated the microfilament inhibitor cytochalasin-D, the microtubule inhibitor colchicine, the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine, and the inhibitor of acidic vesicle function nigericin. We found that all of these compounds caused dose-dependent inhibition of progesterone synthesis in the MA-10 cells. Each compound also inhibited (Bu)2cAMP-stimulated pregnenolone synthesis, indicating that each inhibited a fundamental process required for steroidogenesis. Each compound was next evaluated for inhibitory actions on cholesterol transport to and from the plasma membrane. On the basis of inhibitor sensitivity, two different categories of cholesterol transport were defined. Transport of newly synthesized or low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol from the cell interior to the plasma membrane was inhibitor insensitive. Plasma membrane cholesterol internalization, however, was sensitive to all of the inhibitors and did not result because of any drug effect on the acyl-coenzyme-A-cholesterol acyl transferase. Cycling of cholesteryl ester-derived cholesterol through the plasma membrane appeared to occur before its use for steroidogenesis. Thus, inhibition of plasma membrane internalization would prevent utilization of both plasma membrane cholesterol and cholesteryl ester-derived cholesterol, the two major substrate sources for steroid hormone synthesis. Consistent with this interpretation was the finding that inhibition of plasma membrane cholesterol internalization by each inhibitor paralleled the inhibitor's effect on steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "90228223\r", 
  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide found in a variety of hypothalamic loci which is frequently colocalized with catecholamines. It is also secreted into hypophyseal portal vessels. The injection of NPY into the third ventricle (3V) lowered plasma GH levels in conscious, freely moving male rats. To determine the physiological significance of the hypothalamic inhibitory action of the peptide, highly specific antiserum directed against NPY was injected into the 3V of conscious rats. 3V injection of the antiserum evoked a significant elevation of plasma GH within 2 h on comparison to values in normal rabbit serum-injected, ovariectomized rats. The difference increased and reached a maximum at 6 h after injection. On the other hand, there was no effect of the antiserum in ovariectomized, estrogen, progesterone-blocked rats. Intraventricular injection of the anti-NPY serum also caused a significant elevation of plasma GH within 2 h in normal male rats and the increases above values in normal rat serum-injected control animals became even more significant at 3 and 4 h. To determine the mechanism by which NPY lowers GH after its intraventricular injection, its effect on the release of somatostatin (SRIF) from median eminence fragments incubated in vitro was examined. NPY stimulated SRIF release with a highly significant effect at a concentration of 10(-9) M. Borderline stimulation was observed at doses as low as 10(-11) M. The curve was bell-shaped with a declining release at 10(-8) M and 10(-7) M. The releasing action of NPY was blocked by either the alpha 1-receptor blocker, prazosin (10(-6) M), or the beta-receptor blocker, propranolol (10(-6) M), but was not affected by the alpha 2-receptor blocker, yohimbine (10(-6) M). We conclude that NPY has a physiologically significant inhibitory action within the hypothalamus to suppress GH release in ovariectomized female and intact male rats by stimulation of SRIF release by alpha 1 and beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured rat somatotrophic cells have been useful models for the study of thyroid hormone action. A consensus of previous reports has indicated that approximately 0.2 nM T3 results in 50% occupancy of T3 nuclear receptors as well as half-maximal stimulation of several T3 responses. To characterize the nature of thyroid hormone responses in GC cells, we studied in detail the T3 dose relationships between nuclear receptor occupancy and three thyroid hormone responses (cell growth, GH production, and T3 nuclear receptor regulation). The dose response to T3 for each parameter was unique, and none was identical to the dose response for receptor occupancy. Respective T3 concentrations and percentage of T3 nuclear receptor occupancy resulting in 50% of the maximal response for GC cell growth were 0.05 +/- 0.02 nM and 15 +/- 3% (four experiments), 0.15 +/- 0.04 nM and 27 +/- 3% for GH production (three experiments), and 2.1 nM and 69% for down-regulation of T3 nuclear receptors (two experiments). We conclude that the dose response for occupancy of the T3 nuclear receptor covers a wide range of T3 concentrations. Within the wide dose-response range for nuclear occupancy a spectrum of biological responses are regulated by distinct thyroid hormone dose ranges. These data suggest that the impact of T3 nuclear receptor occupancy on T3 responses might be variable and that the mechanisms involved may be clarified through studies in GC cells.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of oxytocin (OXT) on progesterone (P) and androstenedione (A) release of porcine luteal cell cultures. The present study examines whether OXT modulates P, A, or estradiol (E2) release of so-called small luteal cells (SLC) or of granulosa-derived large luteal cells (LLC). To ensure clean Percoll-gradient separation of the 2 cell types, corpora lutea not older than 6 days were used. SLC, but not LLC, responded to human (h)CG (6 ng/ml) with increased P and A, but not E2, release. When OXT was added to the culture system, both basal as well as hCG-stimulated P release of SLC, but not of LLC, were dose dependently reduced. In contrast, E2 production of SLC and LLC was significantly stimulated by OXT whereas A release of SLC cultures, but not of LLC, was inhibited in response to OXT. In the presence of a specific OXT-antagonist, this inhibitory effect of OXT on P release was abolished, indicating a specific receptor-mediated effect of OXT on porcine luteal cells. When E2 was added to the culture medium, a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on P release of SLC was demonstrated. The presence of the E2 receptor antagonist monohydroxy-tamoxifen in the culture system prevented the E2-induced increase of P release of SLC. E2 was able to counteract dose dependently the OXT-induced inhibition of P release in SLC cultures. These results suggest that OXT may have a dual function in young corpora lutea. The reduction of P and A production can be interpreted as a luteolytic effect of OXT. The simultaneous increase of E2 production, however, may also point to an indirect luteotropic effect since E2 was shown to stimulate luteal P release and to counteract OXT-induced inhibition of P release excessively.\r"

This system functions like an artificial capillary, allowing diffusion of intraluteally secreted substances into the lumen of the dialysis system and administration of hormones into individual CL and simultaneous measurement of the response. After surgery the sows are fully awake and unrestrained. In the present study the in vivo release rates and secretion dynamics of progesterone (P) and oxytocin (OXT) were investigated. The dialysis system was implanted at day 2-4 of the estrous cycle, and dialysis experiments were performed throughout the next 3 days. Fractions were collected at 30 min intervals, and the concentrations of P and OXT were measured by RIA. Three major observations were made: Spontaneous intraluteal secretion of P and OXT occurred in a pulsatile manner. OXT secretion episodes in individual CL often coincide, indicating a simultaneous release from many CL of one ovary but also from the CL located in the contralateral ovary. OXT episodes also often coincide with P pulses; statistical evaluation revealed a significant correlation between P and OXT secretion. Intraluteal application of OXT stimulated luteal P and estradiol (E2) release in a dose-dependent manner. E2 added to the perfusates was also stimulatory to P release. The stimulation of P release by OXT could be antagonized by prior treatment of the CL with tamoxifen. We demonstrate for the first time in vivo the secretion of OXT from porcine CL. The microdialysis system enabled us to collect samples at the site of steroid and peptide release, i.e. within the intact luteal tissue. Our results suggest a stimulatory effect of OXT on P release from young and middle-aged CL and are in marked contrast to the previously demonstrated inhibitory effect of OXT on P release when luteal cells were cultured in vitro. A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that OXT stimulates intraluteal release of E2, which is a powerful P releasing hormone, overcoming the direct inhibitory effect of OXT. This suggestion is substantiated by the observation that E2, when added to the perfusion medium, indeed stimulated P release.\r"

Under defined culture conditions, total specific [3H]estradiol (E2) binding in intact cells attained apparent equilibrium within 3 h after E2 had been varied from 5 to 250 pM. Thereafter, at each concentration of E2 studied, estrogen receptor (ER) levels were constant for up to 6 additional h. We have characterized a single high affinity E2 binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd alpha) of 0.01-0.05 nM E2. The binding capacity of the alpha-site is approximately 5-8 fmol/micrograms DNA, corresponding to approximately 20,000 receptors per cell. In extensive studies, we have seen no evidence for positive cooperative E2 binding. The Hill coefficient was never significantly (95% confidence level) greater than 1. Data are also presented which indicate that [3H]E2 exogenously added to the extracellular medium is in simple equilibrium with the intracellular compartment and the ER. When saturation analyses were conducted using medium that contained BSA, increased concentration of serum protein increased the apparent Kd of E2 for the receptor. No effect was observed on either the shapes of the binding curves or on the calculated Hill coefficients. Furthermore, dose correlations between E2 binding and stimulated response(s) indicated that the ER in these cells was biologically active, which was a major advantage of this culture system over freshly dispersed cells or cytosolic extracts.\r"

The noradrenergic system, an important regulator of LH release, exhibits age-related alterations in the pattern of neurotransmitter release. In addition, the density of alpha 1-receptors changes in intact old rats. To determine whether age-related changes in the pulsatile pattern of LH secretion are associated with declines in the densities and/or a loss of diurnal rhythm of alpha 1-receptors, we measured the density of alpha 1-receptors at various times of day in young, middle-aged, and old ovariectomized rats. By middle-age, mean concentrations of alpha 1-receptors decline in the median eminence and suprachiasmatic nucleus. By old age, mean concentrations of alpha 1-receptors decline in all regions of the hypothalamus examined but not in the dorsal lateral septum. In addition, the diurnal rhythms in alpha 1-receptors, which occur in the medial preoptic nucleus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus of young rats, are lost by middle-age. These data indicate that progressive alterations in the mean concentrations and diurnal rhythms of alpha 1-receptors occur with age in brain regions important for the regulation of reproductive functions and may contribute to the age-associated deficits in LH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibitors of calmodulin [trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, pimozide, and calmidazolium N-(6-aminohexyl)5-chloro-1-napthalenesulphonamide (W7)] and calmodulin antibodies were used to investigate the role of calmodulin in the response of Y-1 mouse adrenal cells to ACTH, with particular reference to events in the plasma membrane. In whole cells it was found that two responses (production of steroids and cAMP) to two stimulating agents (ACTH and forskolin) were inhibited by trifluoperazine at concentrations consistent with those involved in binding of the inhibitor to pure calmodulin (10-25 microM). The steroidogenic responses were also inhibited by the three other inhibitors of calmodulin (chlorpromazine, calmidazolium, and W-7). Trifluoperazine and pimozide (1-500 microM) did not inhibit binding of an [125I]ACTH analog to highly purified plasma membranes of Y-1 cells or to the cells themselves. With Y-1 plasma membranes it was found that trifluoperazine, pimozide, W-7, and calmodulin antibodies inhibited the increase in adenylate cyclase activity in response to ACTH, but not the cyclase responses to cholera toxin or forskolin. Moreover, the effect of cholera toxin on the ADP-ribosylation of specific membrane substrates was independent of the presence or absence of endogenous and/or exogenous Ca2+/calmodulin. The response of adenylate cyclase to ACTH was also decreased in plasma membranes from which calmodulin was removed by washing, and exogenous calmodulin partly reversed this decrease. Anti-calmodulin immunoglobulin inhibited the stimulation of adenylate cyclase produced in plasma membrane by ACTH, but was without effect on the responses to cholera toxin and forskolin. Exogenous calmodulin partly reversed the inhibition of stimulation by ACTH of adenylate cyclase produced by the antibody. It is concluded that calmodulin influences the events taking place in the plasma membrane in response to ACTH, after the binding of the hormone to its receptor and before the action of the G protein (Gs). That is, calmodulin is involved in coupling the occupied receptor to Gs. The effects of inhibitors of calmodulin in whole cells must involve some additional effect(s) requiring the intact cell.\r"

  ".W": "The fetal zone of the human fetal adrenal (HFA) gland is established to have decreased 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 4-5 isomerase (3 beta HSD) activity compared to the neocortex or definitive zone. 3 beta HSD activity, however, can be induced in primary cell culture through treatment with ACTH. Therefore, the HFA with two distinct steroidogenic zones with differences in 3 beta HSD activity as well as the capacity to increase 3 beta HSD activity in response to ACTH provides an excellent model to study the regulation of this enzyme. The presence of 3 beta HSD in the fetal and neocortex zones of the HFA was examined using a polyclonal antibody raised against purified human placental microsomal 3 beta HSD. After homogenates of the fetal and neocortical zones of the HFA were electrophoresed on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted, the presence of the 3 beta HSD protein with a molecular size of 45 kDa could be demonstrated only in the neocortical zone. ACTH treatment (greater than 2 days) of fetal and neocortical zone explant cultures produced increases in cortisol secretion associated with the respective levels of immunodetectable 3 beta HSD protein. Cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were the respective principal steroid products of neocortical and fetal zone explants. After ACTH treatment, immunodetectable 3 beta HSD was induced to a greater magnitude in the neocortex. These findings provide evidence that the lack of 3 beta HSD activity in the fetal zone, previously considered to be the result of the presence of an endogenous inhibitor, is due to an absence of the protein in this portion of the gland. The lack or minimal expression of 3 beta HSD in the fetal zone of HFA may be due to the action (or lack thereof) of a tissue-specific factor regulating the synthesis of 3 beta HSD.\r"

The cDNA was inserted into a modified pCMV vector and expressed in COS-1 monkey kidney tumor cells. The expressed protein was similar in size to human placental microsomal 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5----4isomerase, as detected by immunoblot analysis, and catalyzed the conversion of 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone to 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, pregnenolone to progesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone to androstenedione. Transfected COS cell homogenates, supplemented with NAD+, very efficiently oxidized 5 alpha-androstan-3 beta,17 beta-diol to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone and, upon addition of NADH, reduced 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone to 5 alpha-androstan-3 beta,17 beta-diol. Thus, the dehydrogenation/isomerization steps of steroid biosynthesis can be catalyzed by a single polypeptide chain, which can metabolize all of the major physiological substrates.\r"

Three oligonucleotide probes to regions of the preprorelaxin molecule were used for hybridization to detect RLX message and gave similar results. Northern analysis showed a single 1-kilobase RLX transcript at all three stages of the reproductive cycle studied. The intensity of the RLX hybridization signal was greatest in pregnancy and varied during the cycle. The signal in ovaries from day 3 cyclic animals increased by day 13 and declined on day 19. However, the hybridization signal at midcycle was only 2% of that during pregnancy. After parturition on day 2 of lactation, RLX message was still detected in the ovary, although at reduced levels compared with those during the cycle and pregnancy. In situ hybridization results showed hybridization to RLX mRNA in luteal tissue on day 13 of the cycle, but not on day 3 or 19. An increased hybridization signal was observed on days 40, 60, and 90 of pregnancy, with a decline on day 2 of lactation. Control sections incubated with labeled heterologous probe or preincubated with excess unlabeled probe did not hybridize. These results indicate a good correlation between the relative concentrations of RLX transcript and immunohistochemical results previously reported in the corpus luteum of the sow. In addition, they demonstrate that the RLX gene is expressed in luteal tissue, not only in pregnancy, but also in the cycle and early lactation.\r"

Whole testis, tubular fraction, nontubular fractions, and Sertoli cells cultured in vitro or enriched in vivo by irradiation were used. The results demonstrate that high affinity, low capacity T3-binding sites are localized only in Sertoli cells; the binding specificity and affinity (Kd ranges from 0.8 +/- 0.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.4 nM) do not change significantly with the age of the animals and are comparable to those observed for T3 receptors in other mammalian tissues. In the whole testis, the concentration of receptors changes during gonadal development, being maximally expressed in the fetus (154.3 +/- 8.1 fg T3 bound/10(6) nuclei) and from 1 (203.4 +/- 10.9 fg T3 bound/10(6) nuclei) to 5 (185.3 +/- 15.1 fg T3 bound/10(6) nuclei) days of postnatal life, decreasing significantly at 15 and 20 days (65.4 +/- 2.0 and 57.9 +/- 1.9 fg T3 bound/10(6) nuclei, respectively) and being virtually absent in the adult. The same change in receptor concentration was found in Sertoli cells obtained by different techniques. This ontogenetic profile coincides with the pattern of Sertoli cell proliferation and differentiation, thus suggesting a role of thyroid hormones in the regulation of growth and maturation of the somatic cells of the seminiferous epithelium.\r"

Male rats bearing indwelling tail artery cannulae subjected to 120-min IMO reached peak PRL secretion in 5-20 min. HEM of 25% elicited a significant rise of PRL levels. A posterior cut in the MBH, performed without damaging the serotonergic fibers from the brain stem, attenuated the PRL response to 25% HEM, whereas the PRL elevation due to IMO remained unaffected. An anterolateral cut around the MBH eliminated both the IMO- and HEM-induced stimulation of PRL. Posterior lobe denervation reduced by about 27% the PRL response to IMO and eliminated the response to HEM. These results suggest the following conclusions. The neural structures located posteriorly to the MBH are involved in the transfer of signals triggering PRL secretion due to hypovolemia. Intact anterolateral pathways to the MBH and stalk-median eminence region are essential for the PRL-releasing activity under both stimuli. The posterior lobe may be an important link in the PRL stress response in male rats.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of human cells and biological fluids have been shown to produce or contain insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-specific binding proteins (BPs). The existence of these BPs in serum and conditioned medium of cell and organ cultures has complicated radioligand assays for measurement of IGFs. Various strategies have been proposed to avoid interference of BPs with these assays, including acid-ethanol precipitation of BPs and acid-gel filtration. Many of these procedures are time consuming, exhibit low recoveries, and do not completely eliminate BP artifacts. In this study we have investigated interference of inhibitory IGF-BP (In-IGF-BP) purified from bone cell-conditioned medium in an IGF-II RRA and IGF-I RIA and developed methods to neutralize In-IGF-BP artifacts in IGF assays. In the IGF-II RRA, purified In-IGF-BP competed for [125I]IGF-II binding to H-35 cells in a dose-dependent manner and, thus, increased the apparent value for IGF-II in the medium. Fifty percent inhibition of [125I]IGF-II binding to H-35 cells was seen at 12.2 and 5.7 ng/ml unlabeled IGF-II and IN-IGF-BP, respectively. In-IGF-BP also competed for [125I]IGF-I in the IGF-I RIA; however, the interference was much less in the IGF-I RIA compared to the IGF-II RRA. Fifty percent displacement of [125I]IGF-I binding was seen at 0.25 and 5 ng/ml unlabeled IGF-I and In-IGF-BP, respectively. Our approach to eliminate BP artifacts was as follows. We knew that In-IGF-BP showed comparatively equal binding affinities with both IGF-I and IGF-II, and binding of these ligands to cell receptors (IGF-II) and antibodies (IGF-I) was very specific (2% and 0.5% cross-reactivity for IGF-I and IGF-II, respectively). Therefore, in the IGF-I RIA we blocked the In-IGF-BP artifacts by adding an excess of IGF-II, and in the IGF-II RRA we blocked the In-IGF-BP artifacts by adding an excess of IGF-I. By incubating purified In-IGF-BP with different amounts of IGF-I, we found that 30-min preincubation of 5 ng In-IGF-BP with 10 ng IGF-I completely blocked BP artifacts in the IGF-II RRA. Similarly, preincubation of In-IGF-BP with IGF-II blocked BP artifacts in the IGF-I RIA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Receptor levels increased from 1.74 +/- 0.14 x 10(4)/cell (sham-operated) to 3.60 +/- 0.31 x 10(4)/cell (hepatectomized; P = 0.002), with no change in affinity of IGF-II binding (Ka = 6.4 x 10(9) M-1). As previously reported, receptor levels increased in cells plated at low density, but this effect was decreased in cells from hepatectomized rats (80% increase) compared to that in cells from control rats (300% increase). Serum IGF-I levels decreased 50% 24 h after partial hepatectomy (P less than 0.001), but returned to normal levels by 48 h. However, IGF-I synthesis was not decreased in hepatocytes isolated 24 h after partial hepatectomy, suggesting that decreased serum levels are due to decreased liver mass. Circulating IGF-II levels were not altered by partial hepatectomy, and IGF-II production was not detected in hepatocytes from sham-operated or hepatectomized rats. Transforming growth factor-beta is thought to terminate hepatocyte proliferation upon complete liver regeneration. In hepatocytes from sham-operated or hepatectomized rats transforming growth factor-beta totally blocked DNA synthesis, but had no effect on elevated IGF-II receptor levels after partial hepatectomy. Concomitant with increased IGF-II receptor levels, hepatocytes from hepatectomized rats were more sensitive to IGF-II stimulation of DNA synthesis. [3H]Thymidine incorporation in the presence of epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml) was stimulated 66% by IGF-II (300 ng/ml) in control cells compared with 220% in cells from hepatectomized animals. These results suggest that IGF-II and the IGF-II receptor may play a role in liver regeneration.\r"

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mRNA for uncoupling protein (UCP), BAT lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, and 5'D activity were measured at the conclusion of the study. A temperature of 0 C produced large rises in 5'D and LPL activities and a similar large increase in UCP mRNA within the 12-h exposure period. When 5'D activity was inhibited with iopanoic acid, mRNA for UCP was reduced, while LPL activity was unaffected. The results show that the optimal production of mRNA for BAT UCP depends on the availability of T3; however, T3 is not required for the cold-induced activation of LPL activity in BAT.\r"

Synthetic overlapping peptides of the alpha-subunit of hCG were prepared by solid phase techniques and tested in a standard in vitro rat Leydig cell bioassay. Three regions in the alpha-subunit (alpha 1-15, alpha 30-45, and alpha 71-85) were found to stimulate testosterone production. All three regions correlate with inhibition of hCG binding to ovarian receptors, but subtle differences exist between the binding sites and effector sites. These data indicate that the glycoprotein alpha-subunit has intrinsic bioactivity.\r"

The protein product of rPL-II mRNA has been characterized, and the protein products of the rPLP-A mRNA were recently identified. The mol wt of a nonsecreted nonglycosylated rPLP-B protein would be 27,145 based on the mRNA sequence. The present study is the first to report the identification of the rPLP-B protein. Antiserum was generated against a chemically synthesized oligopeptide inferred from a specific region of the rPLP-B cDNA. Three or four distinct proteins synthesized and secreted by rat basal zone explants (day 15 gestation) showed cross-reactivity with the rPLP-B antiserum. The relative mol wt of these immunoreactive proteins is approximately 30,000, with a pI varying from 6.1-6.6. De novo synthesized rPLP-B proteins were not secreted by the explant tissue in the presence of tunicamycin, suggesting that the proteins are glycosylated. These data are consistent with the presence of one potential N-glycosylation site derived from the rPLP-B mRNA sequence. The rPLP-B antiserum showed no cross-reactivity with proteins identified using antisera against rPLP-A, rPL-II, or human pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein. Immunocytochemical studies were carried out using paraffin sections from placentas of day 14 and 17 pregnant rats which were treated with anti-rPLP-B, followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex. These experiments show perinuclear staining, which was localized in basophilic cytotrophoblast cells, confirming previous in situ mRNA hybridization studies. Although no physiological role has been established for rPLP-B, the synthesis and secretion of this protein by cells in contact only with maternal circulation suggest a hormonal role.\r"

Oviductal epithelium and cervical epithelium expressed ER on the day of birth in CD-1 mice. Glandular ontogeny in the uteri of CD-1 animals was also advanced by 3 days compared to that of BALB/c mice. These observations reconcile the conflicting reports of ER ontogeny in the neonatal mouse. More importantly, these results confirm our earlier observations, indicating that the cells lining uteri of 2- and 4-day-old BALB/c mice lack ER at a time when estrogen induces their proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "To study the physiological regulation of the iodothyronine 5'-deiodinases (I-5'D), we have examined the effects of some thiol blockers and of thyroid status on I-5'D activities both in vitro and in vivo. At low (less than 5 mM) concentrations of dithiothreitol, propylthiouracil (PTU) inhibited I-5'D in the brain, pituitary, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) of hypothyroid rats (which contain predominantly the type II activity); the patterns of inhibition in these tissues were essentially similar, with a Ki of about 174 microM at 250 microM dithiothreitol. Hydroxyethyldisulfide was a strong inhibitor of the type II enzyme, with relatively little effect on the renal enzyme at both high concentrations (micromolar) of T4, i.e. predominantly type I activity, and low concentrations (nanomolar) to T4, i.e. both type I and low Km activity. Preincubation of cerebral microsomes with PTU, followed by removal of excess PTU, resulted in 70% inhibition of I-5'D activity in cerebral microsomes at 5 mM dithiothreitol; the corresponding inhibitions of the renal enzyme at high and low substrate concentrations were 66% and 48%, respectively. Specific binding of PTU to renal and cerebral microsomes was diminished by hydroxyethyldisulfide, but not by T4, suggesting that PTU binding was not dependent on substrate interaction. Administration of PTU in vivo (1 mg/100 g BW, ip; 1 h before killing) resulted in approximately 80% inhibition of I-5'D activity in renal microsomes at high T4, and 50-70% inhibition in pituitary, BAT, and renal microsomes at low T4, but no inhibition was observed in brain microsomes. HPLC analyses revealed a PTU content of 35-65 nmol/g wet wt in the pituitary, BAT, liver, and kidney, but no PTU was detected in the brain, suggesting that PTU may be excluded by the blood-brain barrier. Maintaining hypothyroid rats on 1 microgram T4/100 g BW.day for 5 days enhanced renal type I and low Km I-5'D with restoration of serum T3 to normal levels, although the type II I-5'Ds from all sources were severely depressed. A supraphysiological dose of T4 depressed all three I-5'Ds. The data indicate that the I-5'Ds are regulated in a qualitatively similar fashion.\r"

  ".W": "Marrow ablation in long bones induces an increase in osteogenesis in distant skeletal sites. To test the role of marrow regeneration in this phenomenon, rat mandibular condyles were evaluated histomorphometrically during postablation healing of tibial marrow and after inhibition of healing. Ten days after removal of tibial marrow all bone formation parameters in the condylar subchondral bone were markedly elevated, indicating an enhanced osteoblastic activity. The thickness of the cartilaginous zone of calcification was also augmented. These changes were absent when postablation healing was inhibited in the tibia and after massive liver injury. Extensive periosteal injury induced only a slight increase in osteoblast activity. Except for a fall on day 7, the [methyl-3H]thymidine labeling index in the condylar cartilage and oral mucosa remained at control levels 3-18 days after ablation. These findings imply that stimulation of cell proliferation has only a secondary role in the skeletal response to marrow ablation. It is concluded that the systemic increase in osteogenesis occurs preferentially during marrow regeneration and is not a nonspecific skeletal reaction to tissue injury. Apparently, the systemic osteogenic response is mediated by circulating factors produced by the healing marrow; conceptually it is related to other instances where local repair in extraskeletal sites is accompanied by generalized alterations in respective tissues.\r"

  ".U": "90228272\r", 
  ".W": "The distribution of calcium in isolated bovine pituitary secretory granules was studied by atomic absorption. The total granule calcium (in 26 preparations) averaged 14.5 nmol/mg protein, or 21.2 +/- 1.6% of the total pituitary homogenate calcium. Incubation of granules with KCl resulted in calcium release (78% at 15 mM and 100% at 50 mM, for example). Calcium release was also pH dependent, with greater release at acidic pH values; it was not influenced by either 500 microM strontium or 500 microM lanthanum. Release was augmented by reduced glutathione (GSH), with significant release observable at thiol levels as low as 10 microM. In addition to GSH, cysteine also stimulated release; mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were less potent. Interestingly, the disulfides cystine and oxidized glutathione also stimulated calcium release. Since the latter compounds are known to inhibit hormone release from granules, calcium and protein release appear to be regulated independently. A number of dihydropyridines were tested as potential blockers of calcium release from granules. Nimodipine inhibited basal calcium release at high concentrations and potently inhibited GSH-stimulated calcium release, with an apparent Ki in the 10-20 nM range; it also inhibited K(+)-stimulated release but to a lesser extent. Nimodipine, however, did not significantly influence protein or hormone release. GSH-stimulated calcium release was also inhibited by nifedipine, and this inhibition was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that by nimodipine. Nisoldipine and nitrendipine, however, displayed no significant inhibition. In summary, it appears that the release of secretory granule calcium in vitro is independent of protein release. Thiols and some disulfides stimulate calcium release, and its inhibition by dihydropyridines suggests that granule membranes may contain specific ion channels. The role of granule calcium in the cell remains to be defined.\r"

Computer analysis resolved 681 spots, with mol wt ranging from 10-105K and isoelectric points ranging from 4.0-8.0. Fourteen spots were abundant (greater than or equal to 2000 parts/million), with the remainder occurring in limited abundance (150-2000 parts/million) in both clones. Only 28 proteins were radiolabeled at significantly different rates by G2 and C12 cells under basal conditions. The high degree of similarity in the identity and relative abundance of proteins synthesized by these distinct subclones suggests that minor changes in the levels of specific intracellular proteins may have major effects on the osteoblastic phenotype. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] or triamcinolone acetonide treatment induced qualitative and quantitative changes in the synthesis of specific subsets of proteins, including induction of novel proteins, complete repression of proteins synthesized under basal conditions, and significant increases or decreases in the levels of others. 1,25-(OH)2D3 significantly altered the levels of 13 proteins in G2 cells and 28 proteins in C12 cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhanced the synthesis of two proteins (no. 304 and 2506) in both subclones. The remainder of the proteins affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 were unique to the subclone. With the exception of protein 304, the changes induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 differed from those induced by triamcinolone acetonide, suggesting that unique proteins modulate the osteoblastic phenotype in response to these steroids.\r"

  ".W": "The thyroid hormone T3 produced a very rapid and transient increase in 45calcium uptake by freshly isolated rat heart slices, which was seen already 15 sec after the addition of the hormone, reached a maximum at 30 sec, and then progressively declined and returned to control values after 10 min. This effect of T3 was independent of extracellular calcium, concentration related (evident at a physiological concentration of 10 pM, reached maximum of about 75% above control at 1 nM, and was smaller at greater concentrations), and thyroid hormone specific, as judged from the order of potency of several thyroid hormone analogs: L-T3 greater than L-T4 greater than or equal to D-T3 greater than 3'-isopropyl-3,5-L-diiodothyronine greater than D-T4 greater than 3,5-L-diiodothyronine greater than r-L-T3 greater than D,L-thyronine. The inorganic calcium channel blockers La3+, Cd2+, and Mn2+ inhibited, in a concentration-related fashion, basal and T3-induced increases in 45Ca uptake in the cardiac slices. The organic calcium channel blockers verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem were without effect, indicating that in the quiescent cardiac slice the effect of T3 on 45Ca uptake is independent of sarcolemmal depolarization. Additional studies demonstrated that the stimulatory effect of T3 on 2-deoxyglucose uptake by the cardiac slices required extracellular calcium and was inhibited by the calcium channel blockers La3+, Cd2+, and Mn2+. The present study provides conclusive evidence for two central issues: that calcium is the first messenger for the prompt, plasma membrane-mediated action of thyroid hormone to increase cellular sugar uptake, and that thyroid hormone produces an acute increase in calcium uptake by the heart, an effect that is demonstrable at physiological concentrations and is thyroid hormone specific and, therefore, points to a physiological relevance for this action.\r"

Novel radioiodinated ligands for the detection of neurohypophyseal hormone receptors, with a high specific radioactivity and affinity, enabled the selective detection of OT receptors in the thymus and vasopressin (VP) receptors in the spleen. OT receptors were detected in thymic membrane preparations and on thymocytes, which had a ligand selectivity similar to that of uterine OT receptors. AVP receptors of the V1 pressor type were present in a splenic membrane preparation. Specific AVP-binding sites, probably of the V1 type, were also present on splenic lymphocytes. Binding sites for AVP and OT could not be detected on mononuclear cells in peripheral blood of the rat. This study demonstrates that the use of the newly developed radioiodinated AVP and OT receptor ligands, with high specific radioactivity and affinity, enables the selective characterization of receptor sites for the neurohypophyseal hormones, even in the thymus, where previously no binding sites could be detected.\r"

  ".U": "90228280\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that the change in transuteroplacental cortisol (F)-cortisone (E) metabolism in vivo from preferential reduction (E to F) at midgestation to oxidation by term (F to E) does not occur in baboons in which the production or action of estrogen have been blocked. Moreover, because the administration of androstenedione (delta 4A) to baboons increased estradiol (E2) production at midgestation and induced a pattern of F-E metabolism similar to that at term, we suggested that estrogen regulates placental F-E interconversion. The present study was designed to ascertain whether estrogen regulates the activity of the placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta HSD) enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of F to E. Placentas were obtained on day 100 (n = 10) and day 165 (n = 10) of gestation (term = day 184) from untreated baboons, on day 100 from animals (n = 7) treated with delta 4A between days 70-100 of gestation, and on day 165 from animals in which placental estrogen was decreased by fetectomy (n = 5) on day 100 of gestation. Tissue was homogenized in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and microsomal fractions (105,000 x g) incubated (37 C; 2 min) in buffer containing 2.7 mM NAD+ and 0.03-1.0 microM [3H]F. Serum concentrations of E2 (nanograms per ml) in untreated baboons on day 100 (0.7 +/- 0.2) were 3-fold lower than those at term, increased (P less than 0.05) by delta 4A treatment (2.4 +/- 0.3), and decreased (0.12 +/- 0.01; P less than 0.05) by fetectomy. The specific activity (picomoles of E per min/mg protein) of placental 11 beta HSD in untreated baboons at midgestation (134 +/- 17) was increased (P less than 0.01) 3-fold by delta 4A treatment. Enzyme activity at term (148 +/- 29) was similar to that at midgestation, but markedly decreased (P less than 0.01) by fetectomy (16 +/- 4). Placental capacity to oxidize F to E (micromoles per min/placenta) in untreated baboons was 3-fold greater (P less than 0.01) at term (88 +/- 15) than at midgestation and was markedly reduced (P less than 0.01) by fetectomy (3 +/- 1). Collectively, these findings indicate that the activity of the placental 11 beta HSD enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of F to E is increased in baboons in which placental estrogen production was elevated at midgestation and decreased in animals when estrogen formation was inhibited by fetectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the present study the effects of systemically and centrally administered Ang II on the baroreflex control of HR were investigated in conscious, chronically prepared rabbits. Baroreflex curves (HR vs. mean arterial pressure) were generated with iv infusions of phenylephrine or nitroprusside. Background infusion of Ang II at 10 ng/kg.min increased mean arterial pressure from 77.3 +/- 3.0 to 94.3 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) without changing HR [212.1 +/- 7.2 to 218.0 +/- 9.8 beats/min (bpm)] and shifted (reset) the baroreflex curve with phenylephrine to a higher pressure level (P less than 0.001) without changing its slope (-1.40 +/- 0.40 to -1.65 +/- 0.46 bpm/mm Hg; P = 0.4). Background infusion of an equipressor dose of phenylephrine did not shift the baroreflex curve or change its slope. Ang II also shifted the baroreflex curve with nitroprusside to a higher pressure level (P less than 0.01), but again the slope was not significantly changed (-2.30 +/- 1.25 to -1.51 +/- 0.52 bpm/mm Hg; P = 0.2). Background intraventricular infusion of Ang II at 1 ng/kg.min had the same effects as iv infusion of Ang II at 10 ng/kg.min; the curve was shifted to a higher pressure level (P less than 0.001), but the slope was not changed (-0.76 +/- 0.47 to -1.143 +/- 0.48 bpm/mm Hg). Intravenous infusion of Ang II at 1 ng/kg.min had no effect on the baroreflex. The resetting of the baroreflex with phenylephrine by iv Ang II (10 ng/kg.min) was not blocked by propranolol: atropine markedly reduced the baroreflex response to phenylephrine in both the absence and presence of Ang II. These results indicate that in conscious rabbits, Ang II resets the baroreflex control of HR, but does not change its sensitivity. This effect apparently results from an action of Ang II on the brain that is mediated by withdrawal of vagal tone to the heart. The resetting of the baroreflex by Ang II can explain the ability of the peptide to increase arterial pressure without decreasing HR.\r"

The specific activity of the [125I]T4 in the fetal tissues was lower than in maternal T4 pools. The extent of this change allows evaluation of the net contribution of maternal T4 to the fetal extrathyroidal T4 pools. At 21 days of gestation, near term, this represents 17.5 +/- 0.9% of the T4 in fetal tissues, a value considerably higher than previously calculated. The methodological approach was validated in dams given a goitrogen to block fetal thyroid function. The specific activities of the [125I]T4 in maternal and fetal T4 pools were then similar, confirming that in cases of fetal thyroid impairment the T4 in fetal tissues is determined by the maternal contribution. Thus, previous statements that in normal conditions fetal thyroid economy near term is totally independent of maternal thyroid status ought to be reconsidered.\r"

  ".W": "Gallbladder bile contains nucleation-promoting activity that binds to concanavalin A. The activity was found in gallbladder bile from cholesterol gallstone patients but also in gallbladder bile from patients without stones and patients with pigment stones. Bile from patients with multiple cholesterol gallstones contained high concanavalin A-binding nucleation-promoting activity. The activity was much lower in bile samples from pigment stone patients, patients without stones and patients with a solitary cholesterol stone. Serum contained very little activity and no concanavalin A-binding nucleation-promoting activity could be demonstrated in gallbladder mucosa. This suggests that concanavalin A-binding nucleation promoter is produced in the liver or bile duct epithelium. The activity was fully resistant to digestion with pronase but was heat labile and could be destroyed by prolonged incubation with a mixed glycosidase preparation indicating that sugar residues are important for this activity. On a Superose 12 gel permeation column, promoting activity eluted in two major peaks at apparent molecular weights of 150 +/- 30 kD (n = 5) and less than 5 kD respectively. The mobility on the column was not influenced by pronase digestion. The factor with the higher molecular weight could be isolated further by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the apparent molecular weight of the glycoprotein was 130 kD. In conclusion, gallbladder bile contains nucleation-promoting activity that binds to concanavalin A. The activity is increased in bile from patients with multiple cholesterol gallstones and could therefore play an important role in the pathogenesis of gallstone disease.\r"

We therefore analyzed rat gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities in liver, bile and serum during intrahepatic cholestasis induced by a single dose of alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate (20 mg/100 gm body weight) and during extrahepatic cholestasis after bile duct ligation. At days 1 and 2 after alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate ingestion, we saw a fivefold and a 60-fold increase in serum and bile gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities, respectively. These increases were associated with a decrease in hepatic gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity and of corresponding mRNA. Simultaneously, necrosis of the biliary epithelium appeared in portal tracts. From day 2 to day 14, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in bile and serum progressively returned to basal levels; in the liver, cholangiolar proliferation was mild and was associated with moderate elevation of the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity and of its corresponding mRNA. In extrahepatic cholestasis, a 10-fold increase in serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity was detected between day 0 and day 14. This increase was associated with major cholangiolar proliferation and with a progressive rise in hepatic gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity and in specific mRNA; in bile, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity was slightly elevated. In these two models of cholestasis, histochemically detected gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity was largely predominant in biliary cells. We found no significant induction of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in hepatocytes. These results suggest that in these two models of cholestasis, the increase in serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity is of biliary cell origin and does not originate from hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because surgery is often performed on jaundiced patients, it is not altogether surprising that the incidence of perioperative complications is higher in such patients than in nonjaundiced ones. In this study we assessed the potential synergistic effects of anesthesia and jaundice on cardiovascular responsiveness of chronic bile-duct-ligated dogs. Responsiveness to norepinephrine, angiotensin II and isoproterenol was determined before and after chronic bile-duct ligation or sham-operation while the dogs were conscious or under halothane, fentanyl or pentobarbital-sodium anesthesia. These data have shown that halothane- and barbiturate-induced anesthesia do not alter mean arterial blood pressure in unoperated dogs when compared with conscious dogs before laparotomy. Furthermore, these two agents did not modify the pressor, dilator and positive inotropic responses to intravenous infusions of norepinephrine, angiotensin II and isoproterenol. Fentanol, however, reduced mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate without influencing responsiveness to the three vasoactive agents. Blunted responsiveness in the chronic bile-duct-ligated dogs to the three vasoactive agents was observed without any marked changes in mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate. The same blunted responses observed in the conscious, chronic bile-duct-ligated dogs were also seen in the anesthetized, chronic bile-duct-ligated dogs. Halothane caused a marked hypotensive effect in the chronic bile-duct-ligated dogs that was not seen in the sham-operated dogs. Conscious and anesthetized sham-operated dogs responded in the same manner as the conscious and anesthetized dogs before ligation. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The goals of our study were to define the composition of hepatic cyst fluid and to determine whether hepatic cysts secrete in response to intravenously administered secretin. We percutaneously punctured five hepatic cysts and one proximal renal cyst from six subjects with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and one solitary hepatic cyst from a subject without autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Most fluids had an electrolyte composition similar to serum. Fluid from all hepatic cysts had glutamyltranspeptidase concentrations above those found in serum [( cyst]/[serum] = 4.93 +/- 5.92), contained secretory component (the epithelial receptor for polymeric IgA) and had glucose concentrations less than 15 mg/dl. Fluid from both hepatic and renal cysts of subjects with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, but not from the subject with the solitary hepatic cyst, demonstrated extensive changes in the electrophoretic mobility of several serum proteins. Initial intracystic pressures ranged from 16 to 40 cm H2O, were reduced 57% to 97% after aspiration of a portion of cyst fluid and were held constant during the secretion study. Within 8 min of the intravenous administration of secretin, secretion of fluid increased in two of three hepatic cysts and in the renal cyst. The electrolyte composition of cyst fluids was not altered by secretin. These data suggest that hepatic cystic epithelium has functional characteristics of biliary epithelium and that secretion by both hepatic and renal cysts may be hormonally regulated.\r"

At the end of 6 wk culture, cell mass measured 9.6, 14.7 and 13.2 gm, respectively. Amounts of ferritin from these cell masses were 0 (undetectable), 0.89 and 2.27 micrograms/gm of cells. To study the effects of iron deprivation of hepatoma cells, three human hepatoma cell lines (PLC/PRF/5, Hep G2 and Hep 3B) were incubated in tissue culture medium mixed with graded amounts of an iron-chelating agent, desferoxamine, for 48 to 96 hr at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2. Over 50% cell death in PLC/PRF/5 cells and 30% to 50% cell death in Hep G2 and Hep 3B cells were observed 48 to 72 hr after exposure to desferoxamine. Addition of ferric citrate partially reversed the cytotoxic effect of desferoxamine. On the other hand, viability of control cells, human diploid cell line (WI 38), was not affected by desferoxamine. Even after 96 hr exposure to desferoxamine, cell death was only 2% to 4%. These results suggest that (a) iron enhances tumor cell growth, (b) iron induces increased ferritin synthesis by tumor cells in vitro and (c) iron depletion causes tumor cell death but has little effect on normal human diploid cells. These findings should be considered when designing treatment of patients with hepatoma. Iron oversupply in patients with cancer might enhance tumor growth and adversely affect cancer therapy. Iron chelation with desferoxamine might have a place in the treatment of patients with hepatoma in conjunction with other anticancer agents.\r"

  ".U": "90228905\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta has a specific stimulatory effect on collagen formation by hepatic lipocytes, a cell type believed to be a major source of extracellular matrices in the liver. Because monocytes and macrophages are the known sources of transforming growth factor beta, Kupffer cells--resident macrophages in the liver--may also play an important role in liver fibrogenesis by releasing this cytokine and stimulating lipocyte collagen production. The present study tested this hypothesis using Kupffer cells and hepatic lipocytes isolated from a rat model of alcoholic liver fibrosis. Kupffer-cell-conditioned medium derived from the rat liver with alcoholic fibrosis, but not that from pair-fed control animals, significantly stimulated the net collagen formation of lipocytes isolated from the alcohol-fed, pair-fed control and chow-fed animals. Acidification of the Kupffer-cell-conditioned medium potentiated this effect threefold to fourfold, indicating the presence of a latent form. Fractionation of the Kupffer-cell-conditioned medium by high-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration revealed the major peak of the stimulatory activity corresponding to the molecular weight between 20 kD and 30 kD. It was completely inhibited by anti-transforming growth factor beta IgG. Furthermore, Northern blotting and hybridization of Kupffer-cell messenger RNA from alcohol-fed rats with 32P-labeled transforming growth factor beta complementary DNA demonstrated the presence of 2.5 kb messenger RNA for this cytokine. We conclude that: (a) Kupffer cells isolated from the rat liver with alcoholic fibrosis express and release transforming growth factor beta; (b) that this cytokine is largely responsible for the Kupffer-cell-conditioned medium-induced stimulation of collagen formation by hepatic lipocytes; and (c) that this may represent a possible molecular mechanism of lipocyte stimulation during alcoholic liver fibrogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies to the human asialoglycoprotein receptor (anti-h-ASGPR) were studied with a solid-phase ELISA in the sera of 421 patients with inflammatory liver diseases, 288 patients with various other disorders and 31 controls. Anti-h-ASGPR were found predominantly in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (44 of 88, 50%) and were closely related to inflammatory activity. In a subpopulation of these patients with untreated, biopsy-proven active disease or relapse, 15 of 17 were positive (88%). In contrast, only 11 of 204 patients (5.3%) with viral hepatitis were anti-h-ASGPR receptors-positive (chi 2 analysis; p less than 0.001). We also compared the occurrence of anti-h-ASGPR with antibodies to rabbit and rat asialoglycoprotein receptors in 352 sera. In contrast to the anti-human asialoglycoprotein receptor antibodies (3 of 107), anti-rabbit- or anti-rat-asialoglycoprotein receptor antibodies were found in 21 and 28 of 107 cases of viral hepatitis, indicating that different epitopes were recognized by these sera. In various other diseases anti-human asialoglycoprotein receptor antibodies were rarely found. Some sera from patients with connective-tissue diseases (8 of 73) and primary or secondary liver malignancies (6 of 55) exhibited anti-h-ASGPR. In autoimmune chronic active hepatitis the presence of anti-human asialoglycoprotein receptors did not correlate to other established autoantibody systems. Thus we conclude that anti-human asialoglycoprotein receptor antibodies can serve as diagnostic markers for inflammatory active cases of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. Immune reactions to the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which is expressed on the hepatocellular membrane as a liver-specific antigen, might contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.\r"

Sera from 12 patients with \"classical\" autoimmune chronic active hepatitis contained autoantibodies recognizing many human hepatocyte plasma membrane polypeptides in the 15 to 220 kD range. Many of these autoantibodies titrated beyond 1:80,000 and some may be potentially \"pathological.\" In particular, one band with an apparent molecular weight of 60 kD was a dominant and consistent finding in all patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis by immunoblotting. Serum absorption studies showed this band to be predominantly liver-specific. Control sera from patients with chronic persistent hepatitis, nonhepatic autoimmune disease and normal healthy subjects possessed low titer reactivity that most likely represented \"natural\" autoantibodies. Anti-human hepatocyte plasma membranes in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis consisted of all three immunoglobulin isotypes (G,M and A) and their presence was not caused by nonspecific reactions as a consequence of hypergammaglobulinemia. Autoantibodies were shown to be specific by virtue of their absorption and exhaustion on titration. Many were directed at species nonspecific determinants, however, some autoantibodies recognized human-specific polypeptides. The majority of anti-human hepatocyte plasma membranes appeared to be organ-specific as sera from patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis reacted only weakly with polypeptides of kidney plasma membranes. Of the activity detected, few bands corresponded with those obtained using polypeptides of human hepatocyte plasma membranes. Our results show that patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis possess an array of liver-specific autoantibodies to polypeptide subunits of human hepatocyte plasma membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fat-storing cells were identified with a polyclonal anti-desmin antibody. Cellular proliferation was assessed by labeling S-phase cells with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine. Injection of galactosamine hydrochloride was associated with conspicuous hepatocyte necrosis and parenchymal granulocyte influx in the first 24 hr. Thereafter, mononuclear inflammatory cells predominated, mainly T lymphocytes and macrophages, with maximal numbers at 48 hr. The majority of T lymphocytes were CD8-positive cells and were located in the portal tracts and parenchyma. CD4-positive T cells were scarce and confined to the portal tracts. Proliferation of fat-storing cells paralleled hepatocyte regeneration with maximal values after 48 to 72 hr. The temporal relationship between infiltrating mononuclear cells, mainly T lymphocytes of CD8 phenotype and macrophages, fat-storing cell proliferation and hepatic regeneration suggests pathophysiological interactions between these cell types in liver injury in the rat after galactosamine hydrochloride administration.\r"

Coagulative-type perivenular and midzonal necrosis and periportal microvesicular fatty change were the predominant morphological features throughout all lobules of the liver, in contrast to periportal necrosis described in the only previous case report with biopsy. Differences in zonal necrosis caused by the same drug are not typically seen in man experiencing direct or indirect intrinsic hepatotoxicity. However, experimental models have shown cocaine to have this ability, dependent on enzyme induction or inhibition, sex and dose.

Immunohistochemical studies were performed to answer the question whether Mallory body formation and cytoskeleton alterations finally lead to cell death or are reversible phenomena. Chronically griseofulvin-intoxicated mice killed at different stages of recovery on a normal diet served as experimental animals. It could be shown that (a) Mallory bodies are very durable structures and are found for up to 6 mo after griseofulvin withdrawal as a result of persistence and neoformation; (b) new Mallory bodies can appear even several months after cessation of griseofulvin feeding; (c) Mallory body formation and cytoskeletal changes by themselves do not lead to irreversible cell damage; (d) the cytoskeletal changes are reversible within 7 mo after griseofulvin withdrawal; (e) a dissociation between disappearance of Mallory bodies and restoration of a regularly immunostained cytoplasmic cytokeratin meshwork is observed.\r"

  ".U": "90228914\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that glucagon contributes to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension by increasing portal blood flow. This study examined this issue by assessing the hemodynamic effects of a pharmacological dose of glucagon (1 mg, intravenously) in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension (n = 10) and in subjects without significant liver disease (controls = n = 5). Patients with cirrhosis had much higher glucagon levels than control subjects (875 +/- 167 vs. 186 +/- 25 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and showed blunted hemodynamic responses after glucagon administration. This occurred despite greater circulating glucagon levels, probably because of a significant prolongation of the plasma half-life of exogenously administered glucagon (4.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.1 min, p less than 0.1). Control subjects had marked increases in heart rate (+ 19% +/- 4%, p less than 0.01), cardiac index (+ 16% +/- 4%, p = 0.01) and arterial pressure (+ 10% +/- 3%, p less than 0.05), but corresponding changes in patients with cirrhosis (+ 7% +/- 1%, + 6% +/- 1%, and + 6% +/- 2%, respectively) were significantly less pronounced (p = 0.05), and there was a negative correlation between basal glucagon levels and the response of heart rate to glucagon injection (r = -0.804, p less than 0.001). Resistance to the systemic effects of glucagon in cirrhosis may thus be caused by a down-regulation of vascular glucagon receptors. In addition, glucagon administration caused a significant increase in portal pressure (from 18.1 +/- 1.1 to 19.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), as well as in azygos blood flow (from 0.54 +/- 0.03 to 0.64 +/- 0.04 L/min, + 19% +/- 4%, p less than 0.02), reflecting increased portocollateral blood flow. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that glucagon is one of the factors contributing to the splanchnic vasodilatation and increased portal pressure of cirrhosis.\r"

Portal pressure and gastroesophageal collateral (azygous) blood flow are similar in patients with cirrhosis with or without a history of variceal bleeding. However, acute increases in these parameters in individual patients might predispose them to variceal rupture. Fifteen patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension were evaluated to test the hypothesis that ethanol intake acutely increases portal pressure or gastroesophageal blood flow and is a possible risk factor in variceal hemorrhage. A 10% solution of ethanol in 5% dextrose in water was infused intravenously at a rate sufficient to raise the blood-alcohol level to 100 mg/dl over 30 min. Eight patients received ethanol 5% dextrose in water; seven patients received a placebo (5% dextrose in water alone). Ethanol did not produce a significant change in wedged hepatic-vein pressure, free hepatic-vein pressure, azygous blood flow, mean arterial pressure or heart rate compared with the effects of 5% dextrose in water alone. Acute administration of ethanol does not increase portal pressure or gastroesophageal blood flow. It is unlikely that acute ethanol ingestion is a risk factor for variceal hemorrhage.\r"

Administration of a noncomatogenic dose of methanethiol through inspired air or injection into the upper colon resulted in an elevation of the concentrations of methanethiol mixed disulfides in serum (protein--S--S--CH3 and X--S--S--CH3, X yet unknown) and in urine (X--S--S--CH3). The concentrations of methanethiol mixed disulfides proved to be a relative measure of exposure to methanethiol. The levels of volatile sulfur compounds methanethiol, dimethylsulfide and dimethyldisulfide in the air expired by rats exposed to a noncomatogenic dose of methanethiol through the colon were also elevated. Rats with acute hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver ischemia also showed elevation of methanethiol mixed disulfide levels on challenge of methanethiol through the colon or inspired air, but to a significantly smaller extent than did the corresponding sham-operated rats. This suggests that the liver is at least partly responsible for formation of methanethiol mixed disulfides. No additional toxic effects were observed in the rats with ischemic livers on methanethiol exposition when compared with normal rats, suggesting that the liver does not play an essential role in methanethiol detoxification. Metabolism of methanethiol by blood to sulfate, for example, might be more important. In rats with acute hepatic encephalopathy caused by liver ischemia and in dogs suffering from hepatic encephalopathy resulting from chronic liver disease, large and significant increases in ammonia levels were measured. However, the mean levels of methanethiol mixed disulfides in rats and dogs with hepatic encephalopathy were not different from the mean normal levels in these animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acute myocardial uptake of digoxin was measured at a constant paced heart rate (75 beats/min) for 30 min after an intravenous bolus injection of 500 micrograms of digoxin in 14 patients with ischemic heart disease. Myocardial digoxin content, determined by serial measurement of aortocoronary sinus digoxin concentration gradients and coronary sinus blood flow, was expressed relative to coronary sinus blood flow at rest and correlated with simultaneous hemodynamic and electrocardiographic changes. Myocardial digoxin uptake was extensive (4.1 +/- 0.7% of total injected dose at 30 min) and prolonged, with rapid initial uptake (75.3 +/- 6.6% of maximum at 3 min), followed by a variable phase of slower accumulation. Peak left ventricular positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) increased progressively (p less than 0.01), with a similar time course to that of myocardial digoxin accumulation; maximal change was 18.5 +/- 4.7% at 27 min. The ratio of inotropic effect to myocardial digoxin content did not vary significantly over the period of the experiment. However, peak inotropic effects in individual patients were not significantly related to peak myocardial digoxin content. The spontaneous PR interval increased transiently, with a peak increase of 5.9 +/- 1.8% (p less than 0.05) 12 min after digoxin administration. It is concluded that after intravenous bolus administration, 1) peak effects of digoxin on atrioventricular (AV) conduction occur early, whereas positive inotropic effects increase progressively for greater than or equal to 27 min; and 2) digoxin accumulation in the human myocardium is prolonged and is a determinant of inotropic effects, but not of prolongation of AV node conduction.\r"

An abnormal signal-averaged ECG was seen in 15% of patients in Group 1 and 21% of those in Group 2 (difference not significant). The number of ventricular premature complexes/h was lower in Group 1 than in Group 2: 2.58 +/- 1.63 versus 7.91 +/- 10.75 (p less than 0.01). However, complex arrhythmias (greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature complexes/h or ventricular tachycardia) were equally common in Groups 1 and 2 (20% versus 22%, respectively). Their prevalence was similar in patients with or without an abnormal signal-averaged ECG (29% versus 18%, respectively, in Group 1 and 27% versus 21%, respectively, in Group 2). Comparison between patients with (n = 26) or without (n = 20) angiographic patency of the infarct-related coronary artery after thrombolysis showed no significant difference in the prevalence of an abnormal signal-averaged ECG (8% versus 25%, respectively) and complex ventricular arrhythmias (19% versus 20%, respectively). These data suggest that thrombolysis does not affect the prevalence of complex ventricular arrhythmias and an abnormal signal-averaged ECG or their relation after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Follow-up study until death or the present ranged from 6 months to 24 years (median 11 years) from diagnosis and from 6 months to 22 years (median 7 years) from the onset of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation was present in 6 patients at the time of diagnosis, whereas it developed subsequently in 46. The acute onset of arrhythmia was associated with a change in symptoms in 41 (89%) of the 46. After initial treatment of acute atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm was restored in 29 (63%) of the 46 patients; 43 (93%) of the 46 returned to their original symptom class. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that shorter duration of arrhythmia and amiodarone therapy were the most powerful predictors of return to sinus rhythm. Sinus rhythm was maintained during a median follow-up period of 5.5 years in 22 of the 29 patients in whom it was restored after initial therapy. During follow-up study, 25 of the 52 patients were treated with conventional therapy alone and 7 with amiodarone alone. Amiodarone therapy was associated with maintenance of sinus rhythm, fewer alterations in drug therapy, fewer embolic episodes and fewer attempted direct current cardioversions (during a shorter follow-up period).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether the correlation is better with Doppler indexes of left ventricular diastolic function, 34 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (M-mode echocardiographic end-diastolic dimension greater than 60 mm, fractional shortening less than 25%, increased E point-septal separation) were studied. Patients were classified into two groups according to functional class. Group 1 consisted of 16 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I or II; group 2 included 18 patients in functional class III or IV. Left ventricular dimensions, fractional shortening, left ventricular mass, meridional end-systolic wall stress, peak early and late transmitral filling velocities and their ratio, isovolumetric relaxation period and time to peak filling rate were computed from pulsed wave Doppler and M-mode echocardiograms and calibrated carotid pulse tracings. Right heart catheterization was performed in 20 of 34 patients. No differences were observed between groups with regard to age, gender distribution, heart rate, blood pressure and M-mode echocardiographic-derived indexes of systolic function. Peak early filling velocity (72 +/- 13 versus 40 +/- 10 cm/s, p less than 0.001) was higher and atrial filling fraction (27 +/- 4% versus 46 +/- 8%, p less than 0.001) was lower in group 2 than in group 1.

Acute but vague symptoms were reported by 11 of the 13 patients; skin findings of purple toes or livedo reticularis and renal dysfunction were present in 12 patients, 5 of whom required dialysis. Blood pressure elevation occurred in all 13 patients, eosinophilia in 9 of 10 and elevated sediment rate in 5 of 6. Death occurred within 6 months in three patients. Two distinct patterns were observed: mild (five patients) and severe (eight patients). Compared with the severe pattern, patients with mild cholesterol embolization had early symptoms less frequently (two of five versus eight of eight), less severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.7 versus 7.4 mg/100 ml), less of an increase in blood pressure (22 versus 34 mm Hg) and later development of skin lesions (14 versus 6 weeks). Baseline blood pressure and development of eosinophilia were comparable in both groups. The presentation of cholesterol embolization is often subtle and may go unrecognized, particularly in its mild form. As vascular interventions increase in elderly atherosclerotic and hypertensive patients, so too will the incidence of this disorder.\r"

A left to right shunt through the created atrial communication was present in 28 patients (19%) after valvuloplasty. The pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was greater than or equal to 2:1 in 4 patients and less than 2:1 in 24. Univariate predictors of left to right shunting after valvuloplasty included older age (p less than 0.01), lower cardiac output before mitral valvuloplasty (p less than 0.01), higher New York Heart Association functional class before valvuloplasty (p less than 0.05), presence of mitral valve calcification under fluoroscopy (p less than 0.01) and higher echocardiographic score (p less than 0.05). Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the presence of mitral valve calcification (p less than 0.02) and lower cardiac output (p less than 0.02) as the independent predictors of a left to right shunt through the atrial communication after balloon valvuloplasty. Follow-up (10 +/- 1 months) of patients with an atrial septal defect after valvuloplasty showed that 1) 6 patients died (3 in the hospital and 3 at 2, 16 and 18 months, respectively, after valvuloplasty); 2) an atrial septal defect was demonstrated in 3 of 6 patients who underwent mitral valve replacement (6 +/- 0.8 months after valvuloplasty); and 3) 13 patients were in functional class I, 2 patients were in class II and 1 patient was in class III at 13 +/- 1 months after valvuloplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Severe autonomic failure is usually characterized by both supine hypertension and orthostatic hypotension. Inadequate preload reserve, insufficient arterial resistance and abnormal cardiac performance have been postulated to contribute to the hypotension. To clarify these mechanisms, left ventricular performance and contractility were assessed using radionuclide ventriculography and systolic pressure-volume relations when supine and with graded head-up tilt in 11 patients with autonomic failure. Results were compared with those of 12 normal subjects, using phenylephrine infusion for pharmacologic afterload augmentation after autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol. In a subset of four patients with autonomic failure, systolic pressure-volume relations were similar by both the tilt and phenylephrine methods. In autonomic failure, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and stroke volume decreased with progressive degrees of tilt (p less than or equal to 0.007 for each). The supine radionuclide ejection fraction and cardiac output were similar to those of normal subjects (69% versus 68% and 5.4 versus 4.9 liters/min, respectively, p = NS). However, the slopes of the pressure-volume relations and the supine pressure/volume ratio in autonomic failure were much greater than normal (8.8 versus 2.5, and 6.3 versus 3.6 mm Hg/ml, respectively, p less than or equal to 0.04 for both). The baseline total peripheral resistance was greater than normal (24.9 versus 17.4 mm Hg.min-1/liter, p = 0.01), but the resistance at maximal tilt failed to increase (20.8 +/- 6.1 units). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were lower than normal. Thus, patients with autonomic failure had hypercontractile left ventricular performance when assessed by pressure-volume relations, and their hearts were well matched to the elevated peripheral resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90229605\r", 
  ".W": "Although intraatrial reentry has been traditionally listed as a mechanism for supraventricular tachycardia, few reports describing the clinical features of this arrhythmia exist. Nineteen patients with a clinical history of sustained supraventricular tachycardia were diagnosed as having intraatrial reentrant tachycardia. Seventeen (89%) patients of the 19 had underlying structural heart disease and 17 had echocardiographic evidence of atrial enlargement; the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 51 +/- 16%. A history of concomitant atrial fibrillation or flutter was present in 13 patients (68%). The mean atrial cycle length during tachycardia was 326 +/- 57 ms (range 260 to 460). Fourteen patients had 1:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction during tachycardia, of whom 50% had an RP'/RR' ratio greater than 0.5. Intravenous adenosine (dose range 37.5 to 150 micrograms/kg) and verapamil (dose range 5 to 10 mg) had no effect on atrial tachycardia cycle length in 13 of 14 and 9 of 9 patients, respectively, despite induction of second degree AV block. Type 1a antiarrhythmic drugs achieved long-term suppression of intraatrial reentrant tachycardia in only 6 patients, whereas amiodarone (326 +/- 145 mg/day) was successful in 11 patients during a 32 +/- 20 month follow-up period. The remaining two patients and one patient who later developed amiodarone toxicity either progressed to (n = 1) or had (n = 2) catheter-induced high grade AV block and were treated with long-term ventricular pacing. It is concluded that intraatrial reentrant tachycardia is often associated with structural heart disease, particularly of types that cause atrial abnormalities, but left ventricular dysfunction is not a requisite finding. Other arrhythmias are frequently observed in these patients. This arrhythmia responds poorly to type 1a antiarrhythmic drugs, but is effectively treated with amiodarone. Catheter ablation of the AV junction offers a therapeutic option for patients who are refractory to medical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Early reperfusion has the potential for salvaging ischemic myocardium at risk for infarction. To test the ability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging to differentiate between stunned and infarcted myocardium early after reperfusion, 16 mongrel dogs underwent transient occlusion of the left anterior descending artery or a diagonal branch for 30, 60 or 180 min followed by reperfusion. To identify the area at risk for infarction and to assess the extent of hypoperfusion and reperfusion, two-dimensional and contrast echocardiography were performed at baseline study, during coronary occlusion and at three separate times during reperfusion (before NMR imaging, immediately after NMR imaging and 12 to 14 h later). Wall thickening in the control and ischemic zones and the circumferential extent of abnormal wall motion were analyzed at each time point using short-axis echocardiograms. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 tesla was performed 2 to 3.5 h (mean 2.7 +/- 0.5) after reperfusion. Short-axis, multislice spin-echo images (TE 26 and TE 60) were obtained. Signal intensity was measured in the control and ischemic areas and expressed as a percent difference compared with normal myocardium. All dogs demonstrated a significant decrease in wall thickening and abnormal wall motion before and after NMR imaging. Seven of the eight dogs with infarction had an area of increased signal intensity on TE 60 images. The mean percent difference in signal intensity compared with adjacent normal myocardium was 127 +/- 68% (p = 0.002). None of the eight dogs without infarction had a visually apparent change in signal intensity on TE 60 images (mean percent difference versus control area 13 +/- 11%), despite regional systolic dysfunction documented by echocardiography at the time of imaging. The area of increased signal intensity correlated with infarct size (r = 0.69), although overestimation by NMR imaging occurred. The area of increased signal intensity did not correlate with the extent of echocardiographic contrast defect during coronary occlusion (risk area). This study demonstrates that NMR imaging can be applied early after coronary reperfusion to assess the potential for recovery of dysfunctional myocardium. In addition, by using a TE 60 multislice spin-echo imaging sequence at 1.5 tesla, quantification of the extent of infarction also may be possible.\r"

  ".W": "Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) and programmed ventricular stimulation were serially performed in 12 dogs (3 weeks of age) after experimental anteroapical myocardial infarction. At electrophysiologic study, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia was induced in seven dogs on at least one occasion. Of a total of 39 electrophysiologic studies, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was induced in seven studies and ventricular fibrillation in eight studies. In the remaining studies, no ventricular arrhythmia could be induced with triple ventricular extrastimuli. There was considerable day to day variability in the response to programmed stimulation and the results of the signal-averaged ECG. The signal-averaged QRS complex was significantly longer in dogs with inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (61 +/- 5 versus 57 +/- 3 ms, p = 0.02), had a lower terminal QRS amplitude (24 +/- 20 versus 46 +/- 33 microV, p = 0.04) and a longer late potential duration (19 +/- 4 versus 15 +/- 3 ms, p = 0.003) compared with that in animals with no inducible ventricular arrhythmia. Late potentials were defined as a total QRS duration greater than 58 ms, a terminal QRS amplitude less than 20 microV and a late potential duration greater than 18 ms. Using this definition, late potentials were seen in two distinct phases--immediately after coronary ligation and then beyond the first 72 h after infarction. The appearance of late potentials coincided with a change in arrhythmia inducibility from no ventricular arrhythmia to initiation of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. There is a close relation between inducibility of ventricular tachycardia in experimental canine myocardial infarction and the appearance of late potentials on the surface ECG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Because myocardial reperfusion injury may be caused by various blood constituents, a transient period of blood-free reperfusion was evaluated in closed chest dogs subjected to a 90 min angioplasty balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In the treated group (n = 13), the balloon remained inflated for an additional 15 min while the infarct vessel was perfused with an acellular oxygenated perfluorochemical emulsion (Fluosol). The balloon was then deflated, permitting blood reperfusion. In the control group (n = 13), the balloon was deflated after 90 min of coronary occlusion. One week after infarction, the area at risk was defined in vivo by monastral blue dye staining, and the area of myocardial necrosis was assessed using triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining with histologic confirmation. Major determinants of infarct size, including rate-pressure product, area at risk and severity of myocardial ischemia (assessed by the extent of ST segment elevation during coronary occlusion), were not significantly different in the two groups. Treated dogs demonstrated a 47% reduction in infarct size expressed as a percent of the area at risk compared with control dogs (27.0 +/- 4.4% versus 50.8 +/- 4.4%, p less than 0.01). Treated dogs also demonstrated a superior global left ventricular ejection fraction (57.5 +/- 2.5% versus 51.0 +/- 2.2%, p less than 0.05) and anterolateral (regional) ejection fraction (32.6 +/- 3.6% versus 19.8 +/- 3.9%, p less than 0.05) compared with values in control dogs assessed by contrast ventriculography after 1 week of reperfusion. It is concluded that a transient period of blood-free reperfusion with an oxygenated perfluorochemical reduces reperfusion injury in a canine model of myocardial infarction.\r"

The effects of angioplasty on arterial morphology, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (3H-thymidine incorporation) and lipid metabolism (14C-oleate incorporation) were studied in renal arteries of 24 male mongrel dogs. Balloon-dilated (identified by Evans blue dye accumulation) and adjacent normal arterial segments were collected 90 min and 2, 5 and 14 days after the procedure. The immediate vascular response was endothelial cell denudation and platelet accumulation. Two weeks after angioplasty, healing of the luminal surface by \"endothelial-like\" cells, mild smooth muscle cell proliferation and an angiogenic response with capillary growth into the media were observed. DNA synthesis was increased in balloon-dilated segments at day 5 compared with adjacent nonballoon-dilated artery. This increase in DNA synthesis persisted in the 2 week postangioplasty segments. Additionally, angioplasty produced both quantitative and qualitative changes in arterial lipid synthesis. The most dramatic change was an increase in sterol esterification that was apparent as early as 90 min after angioplasty; the change persisted through day 5 but diminished toward baseline by day 14. Angioplasty-induced alterations of arterial metabolism parallel aspects of the atherogenic process and may be involved in the pathogenesis of postangioplasty reocclusion, particularly in the presence of additional risk factors, such as hyperlipemia.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the spectrum and associated anomalies of double inlet ventricle (single ventricle), echocardiographic data of 50 patients with double inlet ventricle were reviewed and compared with the data obtained by cardiac catheterization, cardiac surgery and autopsy. Standard echocardiographic planes were used to determine the cardiac anatomy and the size of the interventricular communication. Double inlet by way of two perforate valves was found in 44 patients. In 42 of the 44 patients the dominant ventricular morphology was of the left ventricular type (double inlet left ventricle); in 13 of these 42 patients stenosis of one atrioventricular (AV) valve was found. Double inlet right ventricle and double inlet indeterminate ventricle were each found in one patient. Double inlet by way of a common AV valve was found in six patients, all of whom had atrial isomerism. The diagnosis of double inlet ventricle was accurate by two-dimensional echocardiography in all 44 patients. A restrictive interventricular communication was shown in 13 patients and a nonrestrictive communication in 17 patients by cardiac catheterization. Patients with a restrictive interventricular communication had a significantly smaller interventricular communication area normalized by the body surface area (mean +/- SD 1.21 +/- 0.53 cm2/m2) than did those with a nonrestrictive interventricular communication (2.33 +/- 0.71 cm2/m2) (p less than 0.01). Infants with an aortic anomaly had a significantly smaller interventricular communication area (1.35 +/- 0.65 cm2/m2) than did those without an aortic anomaly (2.57 +/- 0.76 cm2/m2) (p less than 0.05). Echocardiography provides an accurate noninvasive diagnosis in patients with double inlet ventricle, offering reliable information about the restrictive interventricular communication.\r"

  ".W": "Because comprehensive normal data and the effect of observer variability for echocardiographic evaluation of regional left ventricular wall motion are not available in children or newborns, left ventricular wall motion was assessed by measuring regional area change. The study group comprised 55 infants and children with a normal heart: 15 neonates (greater than 1 week to less than 1 month old), 10 infants (greater than 1 month to less than 1 year old) and 30 children, 10 each in the age group greater than 1 year to less than 5 years, greater than 5 to less than or equal to 10 years and greater than 10 years. A combination of parasternal, apical and subcostal two-dimensional echocardiographic views was applied. After planimetry of an end-systolic and end-diastolic frame, the left ventricle was divided into eight equal segments and the percent area change calculated. Both a fixed reference and a floating system correcting for translation and rotation were applied. Intraobserver variability for percent area change measurements was 2.8 +/- 0.9% and 3.8 +/- 1% for observers 1 and 2, respectively. The mean interobserver difference of regional percent area change was 4.7 +/- 1.8%. Normal values for the eight anatomic segments were established in each echocardiographic imaging plane. The overall results were independent of the type of reference system utilized. The subcostal views yielded different results from their parasternal counterparts, probably because of differing imaging planes. These normal values establish a data base in the pediatric age range that can be used to detect abnormal segments in children at risk for developing regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities.\r"

Fourteen patients had undergone a two-stage and seven patients a primary repair. Twenty patients were found to have echocardiographic images adequate for wall motion analysis. The results of these studies were correlated with thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scans. Left ventricular wall motion was assessed by measuring regional area change in parasternal and apical views. After planimetry of an end-systolic and an end-diastolic frame, the ventricle was divided into eight equal segments and the percent area change was calculated. Both a fixed reference and a floating system correcting for translation and rotation were applied. The measurements in the patient group were compared with normal age-matched values previously obtained in 55 normal infants and children. Wall motion abnormalities, found in seven patients, were located at the apex in three, at the inferior septum and anterolateral wall in one and the inferior, anterolateral and lateral walls in one patient each. All had a myocardial perfusion defect in a corresponding anatomic location. One patient with a small reversible perfusion defect at the basilar septum had normal regional wall motion. The sensitivity of detecting impairment of myocardial perfusion was 0.95. Wall motion abnormalities were found only in patients who had undergone a two-stage repair. Echocardiographic wall motion analysis can be used as a screening method to identify patients with suspected myocardial ischemia after the arterial switch operation.\r"

Results were compared with those of 28 age-matched normal control subjects. At rest, the cardiac index, stroke index and systolic blood pressure were comparable in both groups, but increases with exercise were smaller in the patients with a Fontan circulation. The heart rate at rest was higher in the Fontan group, but this difference disappeared as soon as exercise started. To determine whether there are limitations intrinsic to the Fontan circulation at these levels of exercise, the 10 best performers were compared with 10 age-matched control subjects; no differences were found in cardiac index, stroke index, heart rate or blood pressure at any exercise level. Analysis of the determinants of cardiac output showed that at the other end of the spectrum poor performance after a Fontan operation did not result from inadequate levels of heart rate, but from an inability to increase or maintain stroke volume. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that impairment of ventricular contractility, only when severe, predicted limited performance. There was no evidence of increased afterload, particularly in the poor performers. Therefore, ventricular filling, which is determined primarily by the pulmonary vascular bed, appears to be a major determinant of functional result after a Fontan repair.\r"

The diameters of the proximal coronary arteries measured at autopsy in 20 patients with complete transposition who had or had not undergone surgery were directly comparable with values determined in normal hearts by two-dimensional echocardiography. The values showed a linear increase with age, weight and length of the patients despite different branching patterns of the coronary arteries. Although there was right ventricular hypertrophy in all cases, the orifices of the right and left coronary arteries did not show any significant difference in diameter. Histologic examination and measurement of the arteries also revealed findings comparable with those in normal hearts. These findings suggest a relatively constant developmental pattern of the proximal coronary arteries despite different hemodynamics between the concordantly connected heart and the heart with complete transposition. In contrast, the functional significance of the stiff and slitlike orifices of the coronary arteries and their comparatively small diameters in relation to the ventricular wall thickness in four hearts studied after the arterial switch procedure for transposition merit further investigation.\r"

The initial ultrasound study defined a ventricular septal rupture in 43 patients and severe isolated mitral regurgitation in 7 patients (5 with papillary muscle rupture and 2 with severe papillary muscle dysfunction). All 50 patients had subsequent confirmation of the diagnosis by either cardiac catheterization or surgical inspection, or both. Two-dimensional echocardiography alone directly visualized a septal defect in only 17 (40%) of the 43 patients with ventricular septal rupture. In all 43 patients the mitral valve appeared normal on imaging. In six of the seven patients with isolated mitral regurgitation, two-dimensional echocardiography correctly demonstrated the structural abnormality of the mitral valve (five with flail anterior leaflet and one with posterior leaflet prolapse). The addition of Doppler color flow mapping greatly improved the diagnostic information in both patient groups. In all 43 patients with ventricular septal rupture, Doppler color flow mapping demonstrated both an area of turbulent transseptal flow and a diagnostic systolic flow disturbance within the right ventricle. In the seven patients with isolated papillary muscle rupture or dysfunction, Doppler color flow mapping not only demonstrated the presence of mitral regurgitation in all cases, but also identified the specific mitral leaflet abnormality by defining the direction of the regurgitant jet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the healthy elderly group, two of the 12 subjects (16.7%) had measurable TNF levels and four (33.3%) had elevated IL-1 levels. Of the 61 ambulatory elderly patients, 31.1% had serum that contained TNF and 22.9% had IL-1. Similar proportions were found in 127 nursing home patients. None of the common diseases examined in this study nor any commonly used medications were associated with increased serum cytokine levels. Patients with weight loss of more than 5 lbs were less likely to have elevated serum TNF and IL-1 levels compared to the rest of the group.

  ".W": "Menopause marks the beginning of a stage of life characterized by an increased susceptibility to diseases such as coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. It was therefore hypothesized that early age at natural menopause would lengthen the duration of the postmenopausal stage of life and thereby result in an earlier age at death. This study investigated the relations between age at natural menopause, duration of postmenopausal life (ie, life expectancy at menopause), and age at death (ie, age at menopause plus life expectancy at menopause). Data were derived from a study of 5,287 naturally postmenopausal Seventh-day Adventists observed during 1976-1982. Life expectancy was estimated by a mathematical model that used mortality ratios from the study and mortality rates from the US general population. For natural menopause before the age of 47 years, each one-year decrease in age at menopause was associated with a 0.53-year increase in postmenopausal life (P = .04) and a 0.47-year decrease in the age at death (P = .04). For natural menopause at the age of 47 years and older, however, each one-year decrease in age at menopause was associated with a 0.99-year increase in postmenopausal life (P = .03) and only a 0.01-year decrease in the age at death (P = .85). Overall, these findings argue against the possibility that the association between age at menopause and age at death in this study was due to the relation of age at menopause to the duration of postmenopausal life.\r"

  ".W": "Clostridium difficile causes pseudomembranous colitis and is responsible for 20% to 25% of cases of postantibiotic diarrhea. In an earlier study, nursing-home patients with C. difficile infection were noted to have a high mortality rate. Because most of these infected patients had been treated with antibiotics, it was not clear whether this high mortality rate was associated with C. difficile infection or simply with antibiotic treatment. A prospective study was carried out to determine the rate of postantibiotic C. difficile colonization and risk factors for infection in patients in a 233-bed long-term care facility, as well as to determine whether C. difficile infection is associated with increased mortality. During a six-month period 150 courses of antibiotics were prescribed for 108 patients. Stool specimens were collected from 36 (33%) patients following the first course of antibiotic treatment, and 12 (33%) were infected with C. difficile. Risk factors for infection included ward location and stool incontinence. Age, body-mass index less than or equal to 18 kg/m2, and diagnoses of dementia and pressure scores tended to be associated with infection, but not significantly. Early mortality rates did not differ, but 12-month mortality for the infected patients was higher (83% vs 50%, P = .05). Therefore, we conclude that postantibiotic C. difficile infection serves as a marker of death in nursing-home patients, one that can be differentiated from the risk of antibiotic treatment alone. This increased death rate may be related in part to clinically unrecognized pseudomembranous colitis or, alternatively, to absorption of C. difficile toxins or even endotoxin from the gut lumen into the systemic circulation.\r"

In human adults, low levels of plasma DHEAS have been correlated with a high mortality rate. In rodents, dehydroepiandrosterone, the precursor of DHEAS, has exhibited antidiabetic, anticarcinogenic, neurotropic, and memory-enhancing effects. We have now measured plasma DHEAS in 50 independent community men age 55-94 and in 61 nursing home men age 57-104. Mean DHEAS was significantly lower in the nursing home men than in the community men. Plasma DHEAS was subnormal (less than 30 micrograms/dL) in 40% of the nursing home residents and in only 6% of the community subjects. In both groups, DHEAS was inversely related to age. In the nursing home men, additionally, plasma DHEAS was inversely related to the presence of an organic brain syndrome and to the degree of dependence in activities of daily living. Plasma DHEAS was subnormal in 80% of the nursing home men who required total care. There was no significant correlation between the plasma concentrations of DHEAS and testosterone, or between plasma DHEAS and one-year mortality rate.\r"

We studied an influenza prevention protocol in a 98-bed community nursing home (96% female; mean age = 87.4 years). Fifty-five residents received amantadine when influenza A was confirmed. Although no further influenza cases were diagnosed, 22% experienced adverse events. Dose in mg/kg/day was significantly higher in the group experiencing adverse events (2.24 +/- 0.98 vs 1.76 +/- 0.35; P less than .01). Amantadine concentrations in 32 residents ranged from 128-5,810 ng/mL. Six residents had amantadine concentrations greater than 1,000 ng/mL. Seventy-eight percent would have qualified for further dose reduction on the basis of estimated creatinine clearance. The results suggest that adverse events may be an important problem with the 100 mg/day dose, and this dose may be excessive for influenza prophylaxis in many nursing home residents.\r"

Incontinent dementia patients had greater impairment of cognitive function and more frequent behavioral problems than did patients without incontinence. Burden scores were higher among caregivers of incontinent patients, but multiple regression analyses indicated that factors other than incontinence contributed more to perceived burden. Follow-up interviews revealed that incontinence had played an important role in most decisions to institutionalize among caregivers of patients who were placed in a nursing home between interviews; it rarely, however, was the primary reason. The majority of incontinent patients still residing in the community were being managed by nonspecific techniques such as diapers and toileting schedules. These data emphasize the need to educate community caregivers of dementia patients in the appropriate management of incontinence and the need for further research on methods of effectively targeting assessment and treatment strategies to this patient population.\r"

Patients did not have a myocardial infarction within the last two years or congestive heart failure and had calculated creatinine clearances (CrCl) between 35 and 75 mL/min/70 kg. Ten patients had urine collections that permitted computation of the ratio between the renal clearance of procainamide and CrCl (PA/CrCl) and the renal clearance of n-acetyl-procainamide (NAPA) and CrCl (NAPA/CrCl). The average steady-state procainamide and NAPA concentrations increased 55% and 36%, respectively, during cimetidine treatment (P less than .01). Twelve patients experienced mild to severe symptoms of what may have been procainamide toxicity. Apparent procainamide oral clearance decreased 41% while patients received cimetidine (P less than .01). PA/CrCl and NAPA/CrCl ratios decreased by 33% and 21%, respectively, during cimetidine therapy (P less than .05). Cimetidine therapy given to older male patients taking procainamide can cause steady-state concentrations of procainamide to rise to toxic levels. Patients prescribed this combination should be monitored carefully for adverse side effects.\r"

Their reasons for taking the examination were primarily to obtain credentials but also frequently to improve their ability to care for older people.

After injection of CsA (20 mg/kg/day from day 0 to 20) we observed a significant suppression of the normal maturation of the TCR2 (alpha beta TCR) cells in their transition from cortical CD4+CD8+ thymocytes to the mature single positive cells in the thymus medulla. The TCR3 subpopulation, a distinct form of alpha beta-like TCR in chickens, was inhibited from initially developing within the cortex by CsA, indicating that the TCR3 subpopulation is functionally distinct from the TCR2+ cells. In contrast, the maturation and peripheral emigration of TCR1 (gamma delta TCR) cells was unaffected by CsA treatment. Mature splenic T cells sorted for either TCR1+ or TCR2+ subsets were equally sensitive to CsA blockade of Con A-stimulated mitogenesis, indicating that there is no inherent difference in CsA sensitivity between these sublineages. Furthermore, no difference was detected in the expression of class II MHC Ag in thymi of birds treated with olive oil vs CsA. Inasmuch as the mechanism of CsA action appears to involve inhibition of TCR initiated signal transduction for lymphokine synthesis, these data indicate that a similar signaling is involved in thymic repertoire selection for TCR2. The lack of an effect on TCR1 cell maturation suggests that the TCR1 repertoire may not undergo selection in the thymus as do TCR2+ cells.\r"

In this report, we have further studied HIV+ individuals with this selective Th defect, and demonstrate that defective in vitro CTL responses to FLU can be restored by costimulation with FLU + ALLO. In contrast, HIV+ patients who have lost Th responses to ALLO were unable to correct CTL responses to FLU by this costimulation procedure. These findings indicate that intact Th responses to ALLO can be used in vitro to provide Th signals necessary to activate the T effector cell response to a potential pathogenic virus. Our results raise the possibility that a program of in vivo coimmunization with ALLO plus antigens of potential pathogens (including HIV) can be useful in HIV+ patients exhibiting selective defects in Th function. Furthermore, this approach could be incorporated in vaccine trials aimed at enhancing immunity to HIV in patients who have been infected previously with this virus.\r"

Recipient mice were lethally irradiated and challenged with bone marrow cells (BMC) from C.B-17 +/+ (+/+) donors. Radioisotope 125IUdR incorporation was assessed 5 to 7 days after transfer to determine the extent of engraftment. Some groups received BMC in which the T cells were removed by treatment with antibody and C. In addition, some groups received BMC from T cell-deficient C.B-17 scid/scid (SCID) mice to determine the postulated need for donor T cells in hematopoiesis and engraftment. In a model system that distinguishes between possible host NK cell and radioresistant T cell-mediated rejection of marrow allografts, it was determined that the absence of donor T cells in a marrow graft does not affect engraftment in syngeneic recipients. However, both host NK cell and radioresistant T cell rejection was markedly enhanced when SCID BMC or BMC from C.B-17 +/+ donors that had T cells removed by antibody and complement were infused into irradiated allogeneic recipients. Furthermore, the addition of alloreactive thymocytes as a source of T cells could abrogate this increased susceptibility of the BMC to host rejection mechanisms. As determined by histology and 59Fe uptake, the addition of thymocytes resulted in enhanced erythropoiesis. These results suggest that the increased incidence of marrow graft failure when BMC depleted of T cells are used is a result of active rejection by host effector cells and that the adverse effect of marrow T cell depletion can be reversed by the addition of thymocytes.\r"

We present here a molecular analysis of the effects of this variability on human T cell recognition of HIV-1 gp120. Synthetic peptides representing a defined CD4+ human T cell epitope in gp120 were used to survey gp120 molecules from various HIV-1 strains for the capacity to be recognized in the context of a single human MHC molecule, DR4. Variation affected recognition at two levels. For some strains, variation in this epitope was sufficient to alter the interaction of Ag receptors on gp120-specific human T cell clones with peptide-DR4 complexes on APC. In the case of two strains, the natural variation was sufficient to prevent the critical initial interaction between the relevant gp120 peptides and DR4 on the APC. However, these strains were highly divergent from the reference strain. Thus it is encouraging to note that the range of natural sequence variation in this T cell epitope falls, for the most part, within the range of peptide sequences that can be accommodated by the relevant human MHC molecule.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we have studied the mechanism of human B lymphocyte adhesion to fibronectin and to proteolytic fragments of this protein. B cells adhered to fibronectin and to a 38-kDa fragment, derived from the A chain, containing the Hep II domain and most of the type III connecting segment, IIICS, of fibronectin. Cells did not bind to an 80-kDa fragment containing the RGD adhesive sequence of fibronectin. Attachment to fibronectin or to the 38-kDa fragment was not affected by the 80-kDa fragment, the GRGDSPC synthetic peptide, or by a mAb specific for the alpha chain of the RGD-dependent fibronectin receptor, alpha 5 beta 1. However, B cell adhesion to fibronectin was inhibited by the synthetic peptides CS-1, comprising the first 25 amino acids of IIICS and B12, containing the sequence LHGPEILDVPST of CS-1 (residues 14-25). Moreover, this sequence was shown to be sufficient to induce stable cell adhesion when coated on plastic surfaces. A mAb specific for the alpha-subunit of the alpha 4 beta 1 integrin, completely inhibited B cell attachment to B12, CS-1, 38 kDa, and fibronectin coated substrata. These data clearly indicate that adhesion of B lymphocytes to fibronectin is exclusively mediated by the interaction of alpha 4 beta 1 with residues 14-25 of the IIICS region in fibronectin. Therefore this interaction constitutes an alternative pathway of adhesion to fibronectin, independent of RGD and alpha 5 beta 1.\r"

  ".U": "90229723\r", 
  ".W": "The E2 component (acetyltransferase) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is the major mitochondrial autoantigen recognized by autoantibodies in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Previous work, using only a partial length rat liver cDNA clone of PDH-E2, demonstrated that the immunodominant epitope was localized to the lipoic acid binding site. Human PDH-E2, in contrast to rat PDH-E2, has two lipoic acid binding sites. By using a full length human cDNA for PDH-E2, and by preparation of multiple overlapping recombinant fragments, we have determined that three autoreactive determinants are present on human PDH-E2: two cross-reactive lipoyl domains, and an area surrounding the E1/E3 binding region. The dominant epitope was localized to the inner lipoyl domain whereas the outer lipoyl domain only showed a weak cross-reactivity, and only 1/26 PBC sera reacted weakly to the E1/E3 binding region area. By probing recombinant fusion proteins expressed from small restriction fragments of the inner lipoyl domain, we have found that a minimum of 75 amino acids (residues 146-221) were required for detectable autoantibody binding, and that 93 amino acids (residues 128-221) were necessary for characteristically strong antimitochondrial autoantibody recognition. Such a requirement for a large region suggests the possibility that a conformational autoepitope may be recognized. In addition, we have found that absorption of PBC sera with the purified mammalian PDH complex does not remove reactivity against Escherichia coli Ag. The possible implications for such results are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "HIV-1-specific cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) is a form of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in which HIV-1-specific antibodies arm NK cells directly to become cytotoxic for targets bearing HIV-1 antigenic determinants. This non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic activity is present in early stages of disease and declines markedly with disease progression. To understand the cellular and humoral factors contributing to the reduction in this activity, the conditions under which maximal arming of cells occurs was examined in vitro. With the use of a large patient cohort, a strong positive correlation was found between the capacity of a serum to direct lysis in standard ADCC assays and its ability to arm NK cells. Patients with minimal HIV-1-specific ADCC-directing antibodies exhibited low levels of CMC and were unable to arm normal effector cells in vitro. The lack of sufficient ADCC-directing antibodies was found to be one cause of defective CMC in some patients. Unlike asymptomatics, only a weak positive correlation was found between arming and ADCC with sera from AIDS patients, indicating that a factor other than absolute HIV-1 specific antibody titer was responsible for decreased CMC in this patient population. Another group of patients was found to have diminished CMC despite the presence of antibodies in the serum that were fully capable of arming normal effector cells to become cytotoxic for gp120-expressing targets. When compared with those of normal individuals, lymphocytes from seropositive patients mediated significantly reduced levels of cytotoxicity in ADCC and arming assays with the use of a high titered HIV-1-specific serum. In both assay systems, the magnitude and frequency of dysfunction in antibody-dependent cytolysis was found to be greater among AIDS patients than among asymptomatic individuals. The demonstration of both cellular and humoral defects in the ability of seropositive individuals to manifest ADCC reactivities strongly suggests that HIV-1 infection may significantly compromise the effectiveness of this potentially important cytolytic reactivity in vivo.\r"

We have examined the ability of TGF-beta 1 to regulate isotype specific Ig secretion by murine spleen B cells. TGF-beta 1, in the presence of rIL-2, induced a synergistic 10-fold or greater increase in IgA secretion by LPS-stimulated spleen B cells. TGF-beta 1 alone had little to no effect on IgA secretion. In contrast, TGF-beta 1, with or without rIL-2, markedly inhibited IgG1 and IgM secretion under the same conditions. The costimulatory activity of TGF-beta 1 and rIL-2 on IgA secretion was seen in cultures of surface IgA negative B cells and was inhibited by anti-TGF-beta 1 antibody in a dose dependent manner. Vicia villosa agglutinin non-adherent Peyer's patch T cells, which secrete IL-2, also synergized with TGF-beta 1 and could substitute for the activity of LPS and rIL-2 on the IgA response. Finally, IL-5 added after 2 days of culture, but not at the beginning of culture, synergized with TGF-beta 1 on the IgA response. These studies indicate that TGF-beta 1 can interact with other lymphokines and selectively modulate the IgA response.\r"

Cytotoxic effector cells generated during an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction were previously shown to express the human p55 IL-2 receptor subunit, whereas resting cells do not express this receptor peptide. In this study, we asked whether Pseudomonas exotoxin or bismuth-212 (an alpha-particle emitting radionuclide) coupled to the anti-IL-2 receptor mAb, anti-Tac, were able to selectively eliminate alloresponsive cells generated during an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. After assembly, anti-Tac immunoconjugates retained their binding integrity, specificity, and selectivity. Deletion of alloresponsive cells was shown by the removal of alloproliferating cells as assessed by quantitating cell recovery and by measurement of thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA. Both toxin and radionuclide immunoconjugates eliminated established cytotoxic effector cells generated in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, while leaving intact the PHA-inducible mitogenic response of the nonactivated cells. The addition of excess anti-Tac blocked all of the effects of these cytotoxic reagents. The therapeutic reagents in vitro were most effective when added just prior to the peak of the alloproliferative response, when receptor expression would be close to maximum. Thus, anti-Tac conjugated either with toxin or radionuclide is effective in vitro in specifically eliminating cytotoxic effector cells.\r"

The cytotoxic activity in the culture medium reached maximum levels approximately 4 days after the cell culture was initiated. The constitutive production of the factors was not influenced by depletion of serum from the medium or by the addition of either phorbol ester or bacterial endotoxin. The factor has a Mr greater than 10 kDa, and its cytotoxicity was abolished by anti-serum against murine TNF. Northern blot analysis with the use of cDNA probes to murine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and lymphotoxin (LT, TNF-beta) showed high levels of TNF-mRNA in the pre-B cell lines, lower levels in the mature B cell lines and no TNF-mRNA in the myeloma cell lines. LT mRNA was present in pre-B cell lines, at a much lower concentration in only one of the B cell lines, and was not present in three other B lymphomas or in the myelomas tested. The results show a positive correlation between the presence of TNF and/or LT mRNA and the 51Cr-releasing activity present in the cell culture medium. Our data indicate that TNF and LT can be produced by murine B cells and that the synthesis of these cytokines may be restricted to certain differentiation stages of the B cell lineage.\r"

  ".U": "90229731\r", 
  ".W": "A negative influence of IL-4 on the IL-2-induced B cell proliferation and differentiation has recently been reported. In this study, we have further investigated a role of IL-4 on human tonsillar B cell proliferation and IL-2R expression. IL-4 enhanced Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 strain (SAC)-induced B cell proliferation, reaching the peak on day 3. However, from day 4, IL-4 inhibited IL-2-induced proliferation. In the cross-linking study, IL-4 enhanced the density of 125I-IL-2-binding protein at low affinity binding condition (2 nM of 125I-IL-2) in SAC-activated B cells. However, IL-4 blocked the enhancement in the density of 125I-IL-2-binding proteins induced by IL-2, from day 3, in both high (50 pM of 125I-IL-2) and low affinity binding conditions, suggesting that IL-4 is able to block IL-2-induced IL-2R up-regulation. This was confirmed by a binding study: B cells that cultured for 3 days with SAC plus IL-2 expressed an average of 180 +/- 20 high affinity receptors/cell with a Kd of 12 pM and 5800 +/- 500 low affinity receptors/cell with a Kd of 980 pM. By coculturing with IL-4, high affinity receptors were almost undetectable and the expression of low affinity receptors was reduced by more than 80%. IL-4-mediated inhibition of IL-2-induced IL-2R expression does not seem to be due to the direct interaction between IL-4 and cell surface receptors, inasmuch as preincubation of cells with IL-4 for 60 min at 37 degrees C did not alter the binding of 125I-IL-2 to cells previously cultured for 3 days with SAC plus IL-2. These data suggest that IL-4 has a capacity to block the up-regulation of the high as well as low affinity IL-2R-induced by IL-2 in normal human B cells, and could provide a possible explanation for the decreased responsiveness of B cells to IL-2 in the presence of IL-4.\r"

  ".W": "The complete nucleotide sequence of murine complement receptor type 2 (CR2) was determined from two overlapping cDNA clones derived from a lambda gt11 library of late pre-B cell origin. Comparison of the predicted sequence of the 1014 amino acid murine homolog with that of human CR2 revealed marked evolutionary conservation. The murine molecule was 65% identical to human CR2 overall, lacking a single repetitive sequence variably present in man. The 15 approximately 60-75 amino acid short consensus repeats (SCR) that constitute the entire extracellular domain of murine CR2 were 53 to 81% identical to and could be directly aligned with the human protein. As reported, the cytoplasmic tail shared 79% amino acid identity with human CR2, whereas that of the transmembrane was only 33%. Murine CR2 contained 16 potential N-linked glycosylation sites of which 6 were conserved, 4 altered, and 6 lost during human evolution. The hydropathicity profile of the two molecules was nearly colinear with some variation in the N-terminal region of the first repeat, as well as within the sixth and twelfth repeats. RNA blot analysis revealed a approximately 4.0 to 5.0 kb message in murine B lymphocytes, which was absent in T lymphocytes (thymus and spleen), liver, brain, lung, kidney, and heart. A method was devised to more precisely compare the repeat structures. An identity matrix analysis suggests that human ancestral CR2 evolved before divergence of the rodent and primate branches of the evolutionary tree through a series of predictable gene duplications, possibly giving rise to the precursor of human CR1 and murine CRY. The marked structural similarity between the human and murine receptors suggests functional conservation as well.\r"

  ".W": "A human E membrane protein that inhibits lysis by the purified human C5b-9 proteins was isolated and characterized. After final purification, the protein migrated as an 18- to 20-kDa band by SDS-PAGE. Elution from gel slices and functional assay after SDS-PAGE (nonreduced) confirmed that all C5b-9 inhibitory activity of the purified protein resided in the 18- to 20-kDa band. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C digestion of the purified protein abolished 50% of its C5b-9 inhibitory activity, and removed approximately 15% of the protein from human E. Western blots of normal and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria E revealed an absence of the 18- to 20-kDa protein in the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria E cells. The identity of this E protein with leukocyte Ag CD59 (P18, HRF20) was confirmed immunochemically and by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. A blocking antibody raised against the purified protein reacted with a single 18- to 20-kDa band on Western blots of human erythrocyte membranes. Prior incubation of human E with the F(ab) of this antibody increased subsequent lysis by the purified human C5b-9 proteins. Potentiation of C5b-9-mediated lysis was observed when erythrocytes were preincubated with this blocking antibody before C5b-9 assembly was initiated, or, when this antibody was added after 30 min, 0 degrees C incubation of C5b-8-treated E with C9. Chicken E incubated with purified CD59 were used to further characterize the mechanism of its C-inhibitory activity. Preincorporation of CD59 into these cells inhibited lysis by C5b-9, regardless of whether CD59 was added before or after assembly of the C5b-8 complex. When incorporated into the membrane, CD59 inhibited binding of 125I-C9 to membrane C5b-8 and reduced the extent of formation of SDS-resistant C9 polymer. The inhibitory effect of CD59 on 125I-C9 incorporation was most pronounced at near-saturating input of C9 (to C5b-8). By contrast, CD59 did not inhibit either C5b67 deposition onto the cell surface, or, binding of 125I-C8 to preassembled membrane C5b67. Taken together, these data suggest that CD59 exerts its C-inhibitory activity by limiting incorporation of multiple C9 into the membrane C5b-9 complex.\r"

Under physiologic salt concentrations, however, dsDNA and ssDNA bound preferentially to CLR and not to GR. The binding of dsDNA to C1q was not affected by heat inactivation of C1q or its exposure to pH 4.45, which abolished the binding of heat-aggregated human IgG (AHG) with C1q. The preincubation of the solid-phase C1q with AHG did not decrease the binding of dsDNA or ssDNA to the solid-phase C1q. These results indicate that the major sites for binding DNA to C1q are located in the CLR of C1q and are not overlapping with those for AHG or immune complexes.\r"

Both PAF and methoxy-PAF increased monocyte cytotoxicity toward WEHI 164 cells with a maximal increase in cell killing at 100 pM to 1 nM. Methoxy-PAF was slightly, but significantly, more potent than PAF for increasing cytotoxicity. PAF and methoxy-PAF increased monocyte release of TNF two- to three-fold above control release with no difference in their potency. Methoxy-PAF increased cell-associated TNF maximally after 2 to 3 h of incubation and increased TNF release maximally after 5 to 18 h of incubation. PAF induced release of the neutrophil granule enzyme beta-glucuronidase with maximal net release of 15 to 20% at 100 nM PAF whereas methoxy-PAF did not induce release of beta-glucuronidase. Similarly, 10 nM PAF induced 30% platelet aggregation whereas methoxy-PAF induced aggregation only at 1000-fold higher concentrations. Analysis of PAF and methoxy-PAF metabolism by monocyte and serum acylhydrolases indicates that methoxy-PAF is substantially more resistant than PAF to degradation by these enzymes. These observations indicate that methoxy-PAF activates monocytes selectively and suggest that this phospholipid or a related compound could be used for in vivo immunotherapy.\r"

The maximum in vitro T cell proliferative response was obtained by stimulating immune lymphoid cells with 20 nM of the enzymatic S1 subunit. When the T cell proliferative response of murine lymphoid cells with different MHC backgrounds was tested, only mice bearing the H-2d haplotype were high responder to the S1 subunit. To determine T cell epitopes on the S1 subunit, the proliferative response of BALB/c immune lymphoid cells to several synthetic S1 peptides was measured. Only the peptide containing amino acid residues, 65-79, was recognized by BALB/c lymphoid cells and was confirmed to contain a T cell epitope by generating S1 specific BALB/c T cell line. By using this T cell line, the response of BALB/c mice to the S1 subunit as well as to peptide 65-79 was shown to be restricted to the I-Ad sublocus of class II Ag. Finally, we showed that lymph node cells of mice immunized with peptide 65-79 respond to the native S1 subunit.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of murine T cell recognition of the pre-S(2) region of the hepatitis B surface Ag (HBsAg) identified high (H-2b,d,q), intermediate (H-2s,k), and low to nonresponder (H-2f) haplotypes. However, these studies utilized the y subtype of HBsAg. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of viral subtype on T cell recognition of the pre-S(2) region and to identify specific T cell recognition sites in a panel of H-2 congenic strains. Immunization with pre-S(2) containing HBsAg particles of the d and y subtypes indicated that T cell recognition of the pre-S(2) region is predominantly subtype-specific in murine strains of eight different H-2 haplotypes. Furthermore, the B10.M strain (H-2f) classified as a T cell nonresponder to the y subtype of the pre-S(2) region responds efficiently to the d subtype, indicating that pre-S(2) responder status can be subtype-dependent as well as subtype-specific. Studies using a truncated pre-S(2) polypeptide and synthetic peptides illustrated that the C-terminal sequence (p148-174) of the pre-S(2) region is the dominant focus of T cell recognition in multiple murine strains. Specifically, 17 distinct T cell recognition sites were defined within the C-terminal half of the pre-S(2) region. The fine specificity of T cell recognition of the pre-S(2) region was dependent on the H-2 haplotype of the responding strain. T cell recognition of all 17 sites was subtype specific, which is consistent with the fact that the C-terminal sequence is highly polymorphic between the d and y subtypes of the pre-S(2) region. Lastly, it was shown that the ability of synthetic peptides to elicit T cells cross-reactive with the native pre-S(2) region was variable and depended on the nature of the immunizing peptide. The pre-S(2)-containing HBsAg vaccines currently in clinical trials are composed of ra single subtype, either d or y. The results of this study suggest that both subtypes should be incorporated to increase the frequency of T cell responders to the pre-S(2) region, and to insure Th cell memory relevant to infection with hepatitis B virus of either the d or y subtypes.\r"

  ".W": "One purpose of this study was to examine the influence of viral subtype on in vivo antibody production to the pre-S(2) region of the hepatitis B surface Ag. Immunization with hepatitis B surface Ag particles containing the pre-S(2) region of the d or y subtypes identified the B10.M (H-2f) strain as an antibody nonresponder to the pre-S(2) and S regions after immunization with the y subtype, but as an antibody responder to the pre-S(2) and S regions after immunization with the d subtype. Both the S region and pre-S(2) region-specific antibody responses emanated from pre-S(2)/d-specific Th cell function because B10.M mice are T cell nonresponsive to the S region of both subtypes. Although responder/nonresponder status of the B10.M strain was dependent on the pre-S(2) subtype used for immunization, the anti-pre-S(2) antibody produced was totally cross-reactive on both subtypes. This is consistent with the conserved nature of the dominant pre-S(2) antibody-binding site and the highly polymorphic nature of the pre-S(2) sequence that represents the focus of T cell recognition. These data suggest that, to fully benefit from the inclusion of pre-S(2) region sequences, third generation hepatitis B virus vaccines should contain both the d and y subtype sequences of the pre-S(2) region to increase the frequency of pre-S(2) and S-specific antibody responses and to insure Th cell memory relevant to both viral subtypes. A second purpose of this study was to \"design\" a synthetic pre-S(2) immunogen based on combining the dominant B and T cell recognition sites into a single peptide. A composite peptide consisting of the dominant T cell recognition sequence p151-174 positioned N-terminal to the dominant B cell site p133-143 (i.e., p151-174(133-143] yielded an effective pre-S(2) synthetic immunogen. Interestingly, the orientation of the T and B cell determinants and the context of the T cell site within the larger composite peptide influenced both antibody fine specificity and T cell fine specificity.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism and cellular targets of mononuclear cell depletion were investigated in strains of mice susceptible or resistant to lethal infection with a virulent street rabies virus (SRV). Significant depletion was evident in the thymus of all infected animals at approximately 5 days postinfection and subsequently involved the spleen and lymph nodes in mice developing clinical signs of rabies. Immunofluorescent analyses of lymphocyte subsets in depleted spleens revealed that cell losses were non-selective since the relative proportions of K+, Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, and Lyt-2+ cells remained unchanged. Diminished expression of I-A membrane glycoproteins on spleen lymphocytes was noted, however, perhaps reflecting reduced availability of I-A-inducing lymphokines. Adrenal hormone toxicity was identified as the cause of mononuclear cell depletion in that mice adrenalectomized before SRV infection showed no evidence of lymphoid depletion. The failure of adrenalectomy to alter anti-rabies antibody responses or SRV lethality also indicates that involution of the lymphoid system is a consequence and not a cause of genetically controlled host susceptibility to SRV. The mechanism of adrenal gland stimulation in rabies-infected mice appears to involve a virus-induced dysfunction in the pituitary gland rather than a stress response to paralysis-induced starvation, based on results of kinetic studies on weight loss, appetite depression, and paralysis in these animals and previous reports of pituitary infection during rabies disease. The relationship of these observations to current theories on rabies virus pathogenicity is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The murine Cr2 gene encodes at least two related proteins. The first of these is predicted to include 1408 amino acids from a transcript including 4224 coding nucleotides. This protein is predicted to contain 21 60-amino acid repeats plus those residues encoding transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions for a total peptide m.w. of 155,307. The first six of these repeats are similar to human CR1 in sequence and organization. The second protein is encoded by an alternatively spliced Cr2 transcript that is lacking those sequences which encode the first six 60-amino acid repeats of the larger protein. This second, smaller protein, encoded by a transcript of 3096 coding nucleotides, is predicted to include 15 60-amino acid repeats, plus the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. This smaller protein contains 1032 amino acids for a peptide m.w. of 113,328. This second protein is extremely homologous in size and sequence to human CR2. Both proteins share the same signal sequence for membrane insertion. DNA sequence analysis, RNA protection studies and genomic phage mapping indicate the transcripts which encode these proteins are derived from the Cr2 gene via alternative splicing.\r"

Characterization of the clones revealed that the human IL-7 gene contains six exons, distributed over more than 33-kbp. An 18 amino acid insert found in human IL-7, for which no counterpart has yet been demonstrated in murine IL-7, is exactly encoded by exon 5 of the human gene. Clones were also isolated containing 5' flanking sequences and the first four exons of the murine IL-7 gene. RNase protection studies of murine IL-7 mRNA, as well as the sequences of 5'-terminal murine IL-7 cDNA clones obtained by anchored polymerase chain reaction cloning, indicate that the murine IL-7 gene initiates transcription at multiple sites within a 200-bp region. This region, and the sequence upstream of this region, appears to lack transcriptional regulatory sequences commonly found in eukaryotic promoters, including the TATA and CAAT sequences. However, the region lies within a CpG island, and contains potential recognition sequences for the \"helix-loop-helix\" class of DNA binding proteins.\r"

  ".U": "90229758\r", 
  ".W": "The MHC contains many class I genes other than those known to present peptides to T lymphocytes. These additional class I genes vary between species and their functions are unknown. Genes involved in Ag presentation, HLA-A,B,C in humans, are highly diverse whereas other class I genes are of much more limited diversity. We have studied alleles of a gene, HLA-AR, that is closely linked and structurally related to HLA-A; properties consistent with these two loci having been formed by a gene duplication. Compared to HLA-A the diversity in HLA-AR is much less, and does not focus on residues of a putative Ag recognition site. However, the structure of HLA-AR alleles closely resembles those encoding Ag-presenting molecules, although the presence of one or two deleterious mutations prevents these alleles being active in Ag presentation. These results suggest HLA-AR derives from an Ag-presenting locus that became inactivated, possibly as a result of positive natural selection due to changing demands on T cell immunity. Thus absence of diversity may sometimes correlate with loss rather than preservation of function in class I MHC genes.\r"

  ".W": "We performed functional assays on polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes from 21 patients with advanced cancers, before, during, and after IL-2 administration. Of these, 19 were treated with high dose bolus IL-2 infusions (10(5) U/kg every 8 h) and 2 patients received low dose continuous infusions of IL-2 (250 U/kg/h). Five of six patients studied after IL-2 therapy had a decrease in their PMN chemotactic response to FMLP after bolus IL-2 (mean 8 doses) or, after the 4th day of continuous infusion IL-2 (pre-IL-2 values of 82% +/- 17% to 45% +/- 1% post-IL-2, p2 less than 0.004) compared with normal control values. In 8 of 10 patients studied, PMN capacity to oxidize intracellular dichlorofluorescein dye, an indirect measurement of O2- production in response to PMA stimulation, decreased after IL-2 administration (pre-IL-2 mean dichlorofluorescein oxidation (by channel number) 243 +/- 128 vs 3-day post-IL-2 87 +/- 86, p2 less than 0.02). Furthermore, a marked decrease in Fc gamma R III (Leu-11, CD16) expression was observed in 12/13 patients' PMN studied after IL-2 therapy (mean percent of PMN population with positive FcR expression was 81.1 +/- 15.4% pre-IL-2 which decreased to 56.0 +/- 30.5% post-IL-2, p2 less than 0.001). Other PMN surface markers (My4, My7, ICAM-1, LFA1, LFA3, Mac1) did not change significantly. PMN-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity did not change after IL-2 therapy (only 4/15 patients demonstrated more than 50% reduction in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). PMN phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus was also not significantly altered by IL-2 administration in six patients studied (pre-IL-2, 99 +/- 17% vs 111 +/- 28% post-IL-2, p2 greater than 0.2). We conclude that the systemic administration of IL-2 by intermittent or continuous administration is associated with marked changes in PMN function and cell surface receptor expression. These alterations may contribute to the apparent increased susceptibility to bacterial infection observed in these patients.\r"

As a result of this phenomenon, the analysis of peripheral blood specimens and solid tissues is often necessary before a definitive interpretation of postmortem toxicological analyses is possible.\r"

Hair and nail samples from human and canine sources and hair samples from mule deer, white tail deer, cat, moose, elk, antelope, caribou, raccoon, and goat were studied. Parrot and goose feathers were also analyzed. Keratins are polymorphic, and species differences are known to exist. Proteinaceous extracts of deer and antelope antlers and bovine and rhinoceros horn were prepared by solubilizing 10 mg of horn sample in 200 microL of a solution containing 12M urea, 74mM Trizma base, and 78mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Extraction took place over a 48-h period. A 25-microL aliquot of extract was removed and incubated with 5 microL of 0.1 M DTT for 10 min at 25 degrees C. Keratins were then separated by isoelectric focusing (IEF) on 5.2% polyacrylamide gels for 3 h and visualized using silver staining. At least 20 bands could be observed for each species studied. However, band patterns differed in the position of each band, in the number of bands, and in band coloration resulting from the silver staining process. Horn from two species of rhinoceros was examined. For both specimens, most bands occurred in the pH range of 4 to 5. Although similar patterns for both species were observed, they differed sufficiently to differentiate one from the other. As might be expected, the closer two species are related phylogenetically, the greater the similarity in the IEF pattern produced from their solubilized keratin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A single dose (60 mL) of a water-soluble contrast compound (amidotrizoate + meglumine) was given orally after initial clinical examination and drug detection in urine. Thereafter, roentgenograms were performed daily after spontaneous passage until obtaining two packet-free stools and negative views. Roentgenograms showed packages when performed at least 3 h after the ingestion of the contrast compound. Sensitivity and specificity of the method with respect to the detection of residual packets in the body, assessed by subsequent examination of stools, was good and did not diminish as the number of packages decreased during the time spent in ward. No side-effects were observed. We conclude that oral administration of a water-soluble contrast compound is an easily performed, efficient, and safe method for the nonsurgical management of cocaine body-packers.\r"

Blacks were overrepresented to double their proportion in the general population. Almost all cases were known asthmatics, and many had received previous emergency care. Most fatalities occurred at night and did not demonstrate any seasonal variation. The onset of the fatal attack was apparently very rapid in most cases, with many engaged in routine activities and few surviving any length of time in hospital or having sought treatment earlier. Our data reveal a significant increase in sudden death in previously well asthmatics in Wayne County in the 1980s. Similar increases in deaths as a result of asthma have been noted previously in other countries for reasons that remain unclear.\r"

Recent rapid developments in the field of sleep-disorders medicine have resulted in greater understanding of a variety of sleep-related behaviors, and formal sleep-behavior monitoring techniques have permitted their documentation and classification. Sleep-related violence can be associated with a number of diagnosable and treatable sleep disorders, including (1) night terrors/sleepwalking, (2) nocturnal seizures, (3) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep-behavior disorder, (4) sleep drunkenness, and (5) psychogenic dissociative states occurring during the sleep period. Potentially violent automatized behavior, without consciousness, can and does occur during sleep. The violence resulting from these disorders may be misinterpreted as purposeful suicide, assault, or even homicide. Sleep-related violence must be added to the list of automatisms. A classification system of both waking and sleep-related automatic behavior is proposed, with recommendations for assessment of such behavior.\r"

Our purpose was to identify those factors correlated with certified class action lawsuits involving issues related to mental health services. Twenty-one states were involved in such litigation. Only the presence of psychiatric hospitals operated by the department of corrections correlated with the presence of certified class action lawsuits involving mental health services.

Blood ethanol concentration was 135 mg/dL (0.135% w/v) and urine ethanol was 249 mg/dL (0.249% w/v). Methocarbamol concentrations were: blood, 257 micrograms/mL; bile, 927 micrograms/L; urine, 255 micrograms/L; gastric, 3.7 g; liver, 459 micrograms/g; and kidney, 83 micrograms/g. The combination of ethanol and carbamates is contraindicated since acute alcohol intoxication combined with carbamate usage can lead to combined central nervous system depression as a result of the interactive sedative-hypnotic properties of the compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Fatal fat embolism is usually thought of as a sequel to long-bone fracture, although cases secondary to soft tissue injury and atraumatic conditions have been infrequently reported. In this case of a two-year-old child-abuse victim who sustained multiple blunt traumatic injuries without skeletal fractures, pulmonary and systemic (brain and kidney) fat emboli were identified. At autopsy, all thoracic and abdominal viscera were intact; cranial contents exhibited only diffuse symmetrical petechial hemorrhages of the white matter. Because of the severe and widespread nature of soft tissue hemorrhage, and the absence of a grossly discernible cause of death, fat embolism was suspected. Using a combination of frozen section with oil red O staining and formalin-fixed osmium stained tissues, the immediate cause of death was determined to be diffuse fat embolism. Review of the literature reveals a pathophysiologic basis for fat embolism in the absence of fracture, both as a consequence of an acute increase in local pressure at the site of trauma and an alteration of the emulsification of blood lipids during shock. In light of these findings, we present this case to remind the forensic science community to consider fat embolism as the cause of death in cases of blunt-force injury without fracture.\r"

  ".W": "Adult male rats were fed a purified diet containing rice bran or wheat bran with or without a marine fish oil to investigate the possible effects of such dietary combinations on lipid metabolism. Plasma and hepatic triacylglycerols and hepatic lipogenesis were lowered significantly by feeding fish oil with rice bran but not with wheat bran. Plasma cholesterol and hepatic cholesterol synthesis were significantly lower in animals fed fish oil with either bran. Liver microsomal free cholesterol was significantly lower in rats fed rice bran alone than in all other groups. Hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity was significantly higher in the two groups fed rice bran than in the two groups fed wheat bran. Fish oil significantly decreased hepatic LDL receptor activity and increased hepatic high density lipoprotein (HDL) binding activity with wheat bran but had no significant effects on these parameters when added to the rice bran diet. However, when the data for all groups were pooled, there was a significant negative correlation between hepatic HDL binding activity and LDL receptor activity. Cecal volatile fatty acids were significantly higher in rats fed rice bran, were unaffected by adding fish oil to either bran diet and did not appear to mediate any of the effects of the brans and fish oil on plasma lipids and hepatic lipid metabolism. The combination of rice bran plus fish oil therefore appears to have more beneficial effects on lipid metabolism than wheat bran plus fish oil.\r"

We hypothesize that the mechanism may involve induction of peroxisomes, with subsequent generation of hydrogen peroxide, and that vitamin E may protect against barrier function loss by preventing the induction of peroxisomal enzymes. To investigate this hypothesis, we exposed cultured endothelial cells to 0 or 90 mumols/L linoleic acid [18:2(n-6)], with or without 25 mumols/L supplemental vitamin E, for 5 d. The induction of peroxisomes by linoleic acid exposure was determined by measuring cellular peroxisomal beta-oxidation and catalase activity. Vitamin E alone had no effect on beta-oxidation or catalase activity, whereas linoleic acid exposure significantly increased both compared with control values. Vitamin E supplementation prevented induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and catalase activity by 18:2. In contrast, cell enrichment with vitamin E had no effect on 18:2-induced accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid-like droplets. These results confirm our hypothesis that the protective effects of vitamin E against fatty acid-mediated endothelial cell injury may be due in part to the ability of vitamin E to prevent the induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes and thus the formation of excess hydrogen peroxide.\r"

The studies took into account the methylxanthine contents of tea and cocoa as well as the poor digestibility of cocoa nitrogen. Balance measurements indicated that all three food sources significantly increased fecal nitrogen excretion relative to methylxanthine-matched control diets (p less than 0.01). In the case of cocoa, virtually all the increase could be attributed to the poor digestibility of cocoa protein itself (estimated to be only 28-30% of total N in cocoa powder). There appeared to be no other effects. With extracts of tea and carob, however, the increased excretion of N in feces resulted either from a decreased digestibility of other dietary protein, through interaction with their polyphenols, or from a stimulation of the excretion of endogenous (body) nitrogen. With respect to the latter possibility, a preliminary investigation with the stable isotope of nitrogen (15N) showed that tea produced a marked increase in the excretion of endogenous nitrogen. These studies, therefore, indicate that foods rich in polyphenols have varying effects on N excretion in feces and that, in the case of tea at least, the loss of endogenous nitrogen may be a major contributing factor.\r"

Rats were fed a nonfiber diet or a diet containing approximately 5% of one of the following fibers: apple pectin, lambda-carrageenan, locust bean gum, gum xanthan, guar gum or sodium (Na) alginate. Pancreatic-bile secretion was found to be elevated in rats fed for 2 wk the highly viscous polysaccharides, sodium alginate, locust bean gum, gum xanthan and guar gum. The polysaccharides may have interfered with the digestion and absorption of nutrients, resulting in a decreased digestibility and an enlargement of digestive organs. When alginic acid and calcium alginate, insoluble polysaccharides that did not contribute to viscosity, were given to rats, they had no effect on pancreatic and biliary secretion compared with sodium alginate. The results demonstrate that consumption of viscous indigestible polysaccharides leads to changes in the exocrine pancreatic-biliary function and may depress the process of digestion and absorption. Rats may compensate for the inefficiency of digestion and absorption with a hyperplasia/hypertrophy of digestive organs and an increased secretion of digestive juice.\r"

  ".W": "The incorporation of [2-3H]mannose into dolichyl phosphate mannose and glycoproteins is markedly reduced in livers of vitamin A-deficient hamsters. To determine whether vitamin A deficiency selectively alters the level of mannose incorporation into sugar phosphates and sugar nucleotides, we studied the in vivo incorporation of [2-3H]mannose, [5-3H]glucose, and [4,5-3H]galactose into sugar phosphates and sugar nucleotides. Male hamsters fed either a vitamin A-depleted or a retinoic acid-supplemented (3 micrograms/g) diet were used at 4, 6 and 8 wk of age; the animals were killed at various time points after an intraperitoneal injection of the radiolabeled sugar. A two- to threefold increase in the amount of [2-3H]mannose was found in liver of hamsters fed a vitamin A-depleted diet for 4 wk, resulting in enhanced incorporation into mannosyl-phosphate and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) mannose. As deficiency progressed, there was a smaller increase in [2-3H]mannose and a significant decrease in [3H]mannose-phosphate and GDP-[3H]mannose, suggesting a decreased mannose kinase activity. [5-3H]Glucose-labeled livers showed no difference in the total uptake of the label or its incorporation into uridine diphosphate glucose and galactose-phosphate during the 8-wk study. However, the synthesis of glucosyl-phosphate was reduced by 50 to 90% at 6 and 8 wk of deficiency, suggesting an impaired gluco-kinase activity. In hamsters injected with [4,5-3H]galactose only [3H]glucose was found within 5 min in the free sugar fraction. In contrast, as much as 70% of the label in the sugar phosphate and sugar nucleotide fraction remained as [3H]galactose even at 60 min. These effects on sugar, sugar phosphate and sugar nucleotide formation in part may explain the effects of vitamin A deficiency on glycoconjugate biosynthesis.\r"

Fresh, heparinized human plasma and [3H]biotin were incubated in 5% CO2, 95% N2 at 37 degrees C. After reaching equilibrium, free biotin was separated from bound biotin by centrifugal ultrafiltration (1500 x g for 60 min) using membranes with a molecular weight cutoff of 30,000. In a sample from a single individual, we detected a mean retentate:ultrafiltrate ratio of 1.20 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD, n = 14 determinations). In a group of 10 healthy adults, the mean retentate:ultrafiltrate ratio was 1.17 +/- 0.02; thus, approximately 8% of the biotin in the combined pool of free and reversibly bound biotin is bound. No consistent change in retentate:ultrafiltrate ratio was detected for total biotin concentrations ranging between 500 fmol/mL and 2 nmol/mL, but the ratio decreased to 1.1 at 400 nmol of biotin per mL. Thus, the biotin-binding system of human plasma appears to be a low affinity, high capacity system. A similar biotin-binding system was detected in experiments with purified human serum albumin. These results provide evidence that the majority of added [3H]biotin does not bind to plasma protein under physiologic conditions. To the extent that added [3H]biotin can be assumed to reflect reversible binding of endogenous unlabeled biotin, we infer that endogenous, reversibly bound biotin can account for no more than one-tenth of the increase in biotin detected after acid hydrolysis of plasma.\r"

In this study, a comprehensive assessment of milk was performed to identify and quantify greater than 95% of the flavins in this food. Riboflavin and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) were the predominant flavins in all milk samples; 10-(2'-hydroxyethyl)flavin was next most common. The latter is potentially an antivitamin that may exert its effect at either the absorption or utilization level. Therefore, the presence of this analog should be considered when evaluating the riboflavin efficiency of milk. The large quantity of FAD indicates that precautions against underestimating FAD are warranted when determining total flavin content by fluorescence. This is particularly important because the fluorescence of FAD at pH 7.0 is only 10-20% of that for riboflavin. The presence of 7 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin (7-hydroxymethylriboflavin) in milk was ascertained by extensive testing. Traces of 8 alpha-hydroxyriboflavin (8-hydroxymethylriboflavin) were also detected. These metabolites may serve as indicators of cellular biochemical activity.\r"

In experiments 1 and 2, chicks killed at intervals after the addition of excess Zn (500 mg/kg as ZnO) to a purified diet containing 70 mg Zn/kg showed a rapid increase in plasma Zn concentration that reached a plateau within 1 h. The pancreatic soluble Zn level increased linearly for 24 h, but then its rate of accumulation diminished. The same pattern of accumulation was shown by pancreatic metallothionein (MT), which correlated highly with pancreatic Zn; that is, MT-associated Zn consistently accounted for 70 to 80% of pancreatic Zn. Plasma amylase activity started to increase 8-10 h after Zn introduction and reached a maximum by 24 h. Two critical levels of pancreatic soluble Zn (1 and 2.7 micrograms Zn/mg of protein, respectively) were observed at which amylase activities increased in the plasma and decreased in the pancreas. In experiment 3, feeding excess Zn reduced the incorporation of [3H]leucine into pancreatic amylase protein. This was associated with a reduction of tracer incorporation into total pancreatic proteins, that is, the fraction that is precipitable by trichloracetic acid (TCA). In experiment 4, the enzyme (or potential) activities of the exportable Zn-containing enzymes procarboxypeptidases A and B and ribonuclease were not affected by excess Zn intake, indicating the selective nature of the effect of excess Zn on pancreatic function.\r"

Measurements of fractional zinc absorption were made in 9 of the 15 subjects by a dual-isotope technique using 65Zn and 51Cr (as nonabsorbable fecal markers). Fractional zinc absorption was 0.22 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SEM) after the standard meal, 0.23 +/- 0.06 with added milk and 0.22 +/- 0.03% with the added calcium phosphate supplement. The corresponding values for 65Zn retention in 15 subjects 12 d after dosing were 0.10 +/- 0.01% for all treatments. No significant effect of milk or calcium phosphate supplementation was observed on either 65Zn absorption or retention. We conclude that increased milk consumption with meals has no detrimental consequences on zinc nutriture in elderly women.\r"

  ".W": "To test for their osteogenic stimulating capacity, charged beads were implanted into cranial or mandibular defects, used as an onlay on the nasal bone surface, or injected into femoral medullary cavities of young adult rats. One month later, negatively charged beads were found to have stimulated extensive bone formation resulting in closure of craniofacial defects, a new layer of bone on the nasal bone surface, and a bead-bone lattice within marrow cavities of long bones. Positively charged beads were nonosteogenic, but elicited a pronounced fibroblastic response in the craniofacial skeleton. Positively charged beads were found associated with multinucleated giant cells at all implantation sites. Uncharged beads failed to elicit formation of new bone and were associated with connective tissue that was less cellular and less organized than was seen with positively charged beads. It was concluded that beads that have ben chemically treated to confer either a negative or positive surface charge, when placed in contact with bone, evoke osteogenesis or formation of dense connective tissue, the response depending on the surface charge of the bead. The mechanism(s) by which the charged beads foster the osteogenic or fibroblastic response is not clear. The use, however, of alloplastic materials with charged surfaces in repair and augmentation of bone, and in wound repair, warrants further investigation.\r"

The implants were removed with the surrounding soft tissues and processed for histologic evaluation. This revealed that soft tissue inflammation was mild at each time interval. There was a decreased response at 6 months in ND rats and a persistent inflammatory reaction in ID rats. Collagen maturity and fibroplasia increased within ND rats, whereas the ID rats showed a marked delay in collagen maturity and density. No osteogenesis was observed in any specimen. Dystrophic calcification was observed at the HA-tissue interface in 37% of ND and 59% of ID specimens. It was concluded that HA elicited a greater inflammatory response in ID than in ND rats when implated subcutaneously.\r"

Pokeweed mitogen stimulation of peripheral mononuclear cells from newborn infants, normal adults, and patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis indicated that the ability to make C3NeF is apparently present in everyone from the time of birth. In addition, C3NeF appeared to express a single or very limited idiotope (21/21 isolates). The data also suggest that the elaboration of C3NeF may approximate an antibody response after immunization. Thus the C3NeF fraction of the total IgG or IgM produced in culture by pokeweed mitogen-stimulated mononuclear cells from normal neonates and adults, as well as from patients, was in the range of the production of specific antibody. Further, both IgG and IgM C3NeF produced by cells from these normal individuals, including newborn infants, had an affinity for antigen (10(8) to 10(9) L/mol) that was also in the range of specific antibody. Most of the autoantibody molecules (5/7) from serum were IgG3; two B cell clones producing C3NeF were CD5-negative. These experiments indicate that unmutated germline genes are used in the production of C3NeF and that a limited spectrum of antiidiotypic antibodies regulate its production.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between complete deficiency for either isotype of the fourth component of complement, C4A or C4B, and glomerulonephritis was initially examined in white patients from Kentucky with either IgA nephropathy or Schonlein-Henoch purpura. Subsequently, C4B deficiency was found to be associated with IgA nephropathy for pediatric patients followed in Cincinnati, Ohio. We later reported that at least 60% of the original patients from Kentucky were related to at least one other patient with the disease. This finding raised the possibility that the C4 phenotype frequencies for these patients may have been biased by the fact that they were based on a sample of related patients. In our study, C4 phenotyping was performed for 52 related and 63 unrelated patients from Kentucky, 81 unrelated patients from the Mid-South region of the United States, and 39 unrelated patients from the Puglia region of southeastern Italy. In addition, data from patients with IgA nephropathy from Spain were available for comparative studies. Neither C4A deficiency nor C4B deficiency was significantly increased for groups of unrelated patients from the Mid-South, Italy, Spain, or Kentucky in comparison with regional control subjects. In fact, C4A and C4B deficiencies did not occur in any of the Italian patients. With the exception of C4A.6, frequencies for the most common C4A and C4B alleles did not differ among the unrelated patient and control groups from Kentucky and the Mid-South. In addition, no significant differences in C4A and C4B allelic frequencies were observed in comparisons of pediatric patients (diagnostic biopsy before age 18 years) and adult patients with IgA nephropathy in either U.S. population. Italian control subjects had a significantly lower frequency for C4A null alleles in comparison with control subjects from both Kentucky and the Mid-South; a significantly higher frequency of C4B null alleles was found among Kentucky control subjects than in Mid-South, Italian, and Spanish control samples. The importance of recognizing the ethnic background of study subjects and of eliciting a good family history to minimize unsuspected sampling of related patients should be considered in future disease association studies.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-one pediatric patients with acute renal allograft rejection were treated with the monoclonal antibody OKT3. In 24 cases, increased doses of steroids followed by a polyclonal antithymocyte globulin were ineffective in reversing the rejection episode. Twenty-eight patients completed the prescribed minimum 10-day treatment course, with effective rejection reversal in 22. Three patients failed to complete the course of therapy: one because of leukopenia that developed after the first dose, one because of a clotted graft, and another because of symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection. The overall success rate of OKT3 for rejection reversal was 74%; however, 55% of recipients had rebound rejection, and 85% of patients had detectable anti-OKT3 antibodies after completion of the course of therapy. Ten patients were treated with a second course of OKT3, and in eight of these patients, rejection was at least temporarily reversed. The starting dose of OKT3 for second-course therapy was the same as that used during first-course therapy, but in five cases the dose was increased during the course because of inadequate therapeutic response. Seven of these patients lost their grafts a mean of 6.5 months after completion of second-course therapy. We looked for anti-OKT3 antibody in nine recipients after completion of a second treatment course and found it in all nine. Our observations regarding a second treatment course with this monoclonal antibody preparation suggest that although rejection reversal may be observed, ultimate graft survival is poor and anti-OKT3 antibody formation is enhanced.\r"

An excess frequency of the F allotype has been implicated in a number of disease states, including some forms of glomerulonephritis. These associations have been explained by functional differences between C3S and C3F. We examined several complement functions, using purified preparations of C3S or C3F. The C3S allotype was 1.3 times more efficient than C3F in a hemolytic assay employing sensitized sheep erythrocytes; this difference was shown to arise from a slightly more efficient deposition of C3F on the cell surface. These differences are trivial and of much less magnitude than the functional differences between C4A and C4B. There were no differences between allotypes in their ability to be converted to inactive C3b (C3bi) by complement factors H and I or by CR1 and factor I. No significant differences were seen between the allotypes and their ability to support solubilization of preformed immune complexes.\r"

  ".W": "With the exception of C3 nephritic factor, autoantibody formation has not been commonly associated with membranoproliferative nephritis (MPGN). We measured autoantibodies (nephritic factors) to the C3 convertases C3bBb (NFa) and C3bBbP (NFt), which result in fast and slow C3 activation, respectively, and to a neoantigen on C1q fixed to a solid phase (spC1q) in sera from 29 patients with MPGN type I, 26 with type II, and 28 with type III. Autoantibody formation was common in all MPGN types. An autoantibody to a C3 convertase neoantigen was identified in more than 75% of the hypocomplementemic MPGN sera tested. Anti-C3bBb (NFa) was present in 81% of patients with MPGN type II but was rarely found in either type I or type III. Anti-C3bBbP (NFt) was common in both MPGN I and III. Anti-spC1q was present in 74% of patients with type I and in 38% and 48% of types II and III MPGN, respectively. Patients with MPGN types I, II, and III had one and two serum autoantibodies detected significantly more frequently than did a group of healthy subjects. The presence of any one autoantibody was not specifically associated with the presence of any other autoantibody. The results indicate that multiple autoantibody formation is common in all MPGN types. MPGN II, and possibly MPGN I, tend to form more specific autoantibodies.\r"

  ".W": "We explored the possibility that standard infant formulas designed as the sole source of nutrients for small, rapidly growing infants may not be equally suitable for older, larger, and less rapidly growing infants who obtain a portion of energy intake from beikost. Our approach was to consider the probable nutrient intakes of a 6-month-old hypothetic infant receiving 80% of energy intake from a standard formula and 20% from beikost, and nutrient intakes of a 10-month-old hypothetic infant receiving 50% of energy intake from a standard formula and 50% from beikost. The assortment of beikost items consumed by infants is moderately high in protein and low in fat. Calculated nutrient intakes of the 10-month-old hypothetic infant were compared with intakes of infants of similar age in two national surveys. We conclude that standard infant formulas designed for young infants are reasonably well suited to meeting the nutrient needs of infants during the latter half of the first year of life.\r"

The mean duration of preenrollment antimicrobial therapy was 4.8 days. For comparison we studied 66 children with newly diagnosed acute otitis media. Respiratory viruses were isolated from middle ear fluid or from the nasopharynx, or both, significantly more often in the patients unresponsive to initial antimicrobial therapy than in the comparison patients (68% vs 41%, p less than 0.05). Viruses were recovered from the middle ear fluid in 32% of the study patients and from 15% of the comparison group. Bacteria were isolated from the middle ear fluid of four (18%) children in the study group; one child had an isolate resistant to initial antimicrobial therapy. All four children with bacteria in the middle ear fluid had evidence of concomitant respiratory virus infection. Our results indicate that respiratory virus infection is often present in patients with acute otitis media unresponsive to initial antimicrobial therapy, and may explain the prolongation of symptoms of infection. Resistant bacteria seem to be a less common cause of failure of the initial treatment.\r"

Two children died; 32 of the remaining 39 children were reviewed clinically, electrophysiologically, and with computed tomography between 5 and 38 months after the illness. The electrophysiologic data obtained during the illness were not found to alter the acute-stage management. Focal or generalized suppression, demonstrated on the electroencephalogram, was associated with a poor outcome. Cerebral infarction and edema, demonstrated by computed tomography of the head, were predictive of a poor outcome, but enlarged ventricular and subarachnoid spaces and increased subdural effusions were of no predictive value. Neither computed tomographic scans nor electrophysiologic data were better indicators of neurologic prognosis than the clinical examination.\r"

Breast-fed children remained free of diarrhea for a longer time than non-breast-fed children (p less than 0.0005). The diarrhea attack rate caused by C. jejuni for non-breast-fed infants was significantly greater (p less than 0.005) than that in the breast-fed group. Secretory IgA milk antibody titers against glycine acid-extractable antigen of C. jejuni were high in colostrum, decreased during the first month of breast-feeding, and generally persisted throughout lactation. Human milk consumed by children in whom Campylobacter diarrhea developed did not contain secretory IgA antibodies to the glycine acid-extractable common antigen of Campylobacter. This study shows an association between Campylobacter antibodies in human milk and prevention of diarrhea caused by Campylobacter.\r"

  ".W": "We present a novel condition, designated as a primary disorder of vigilance, that has symptoms which overlap those of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Vigilance is the state of being watchful, awake, and alert. When vigilance is lost, the individual has difficulty sustaining attention. The most obvious evidence of lowered vigilance is motor restlessness (fidgeting and moving about, yawning and stretching, talkativeness, or a combination of these) to improve alertness when sitting or standing still or when involved in tasks requiring continuous mental performance. When prevented from being active to stay awake, persons with lowered vigilance will stare off, daydream, show minor hyperactivity, and finally may fall asleep. They will also have decreasing attention to current activities and usually avoid or lose interest in structured or repetitive activities (complaining of boredom and monotony). The primary disorder of vigilance (for which criteria have been established) is a dominantly inherited condition with onset in early childhood and worsening symptoms with age. Persons with the primary disorder of vigilance have a remarkably kind and caring temperament. When untreated this disorder can cause chronic failure at school and work, but when properly recognized it responds well to treatment with stimulant medication and schedules that avoid sameness and repetition.\r"

Tissue aluminum accumulation was assessed by serial measurements of plasma aluminum levels, from the increment in plasma aluminum after a standardized deferoxamine infusion, and from quantitative histomorphometry of bone and measurements of total bone aluminum content. Initial mean plasma aluminum levels were 0.61 +/- 0.32 mumol/L, (normal 0.30 +/- 0.04 mumol/L), and values were less than 0.92 mumol/L during the follow-up of 20 +/- 8 months. Plasma aluminum levels increased from 0.59 +/- 0.18 to 0.88 +/- 0.22 mumol/L after a single dose of deferoxamine. The histochemical stain for bone aluminum was negative for all patients, and the bone aluminum content was 0.27 +/- 0.22 mmol/kg dry weight (normal 0.08 +/- 0.04 mmol/kg dry weight). Thus the infant formula Similac PM 60/40 can be safely used in infants with chronic renal failure.\r"

Treatment was started between 21 and 33 days of life, maintained for 4 weeks, and was well tolerated. All the patients had low baseline serum erythropoietin levels. After rHuEpo therapy, the number of reticulocytes increased from a mean baseline count of 75 x 10(9)/L to 95, 141, and 165 x 10(9)/L on days 7, 10, and 14 of therapy, respectively. Correction or stabilization of the anemia was observed in six of seven patients, whose estimated total erythrocyte volume increased by 49% during therapy (vs a predicted increment of 18% in the absence of rHuEpo). In one patient, however, the hematocrit declined during the treatment, and in three of the responders a secondary fall in hematocrit was noted either during therapy or after its discontinuation. Serum iron and ferritin levels rapidly decreased after the initiation of rHuEpo therapy, and in most patients transient early thrombocytosis and late neutropenia were observed. These data suggest that rHuEpo may correct or stabilize the anemia of prematurity. Its effects, however, may be limited by a variety of factors, among which iron availability probably plays an important role. Controlled studies will be needed to confirm these preliminary observations.\r"

The dose of amphotericin B was serially increased from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg/day in 10 infants but was decreased from 0.8 to 1.0 to 0.5 mg/kg/day in three infants. Amphotericin B concentrations were not detectable in infants receiving 0.1 mg/kg/day. Amphotericin B cerebrospinal fluid concentrations were 40% to 90% of serum values obtained simultaneously. Serum concentrations after oral administration of 5-fluorocytosine (dose 25 to 100 mg/kg/day) were detectable in all infants. We found extreme interindividual variability for the half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance for both drugs. Four infants had minimal elimination for both drugs between doses, a finding that correlates with rises in serum creatinine (greater than 0.4 mg/dl, 40 mumol/L) and blood urea nitrogen (greater than 10 mg/dl, 3.6 mmol/L). We recommend that the dose of amphotericin B given on the first day of treatment be greater than the usual testing dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day. We also recommend an initial 24-hour dosing interval for amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine. Serum drug concentrations may need to be monitored in high-risk, low birth weight infants.\r"

A follow-up of this cohort of infants at 3 and 6 years of age is now reported. Factors predicting adiposity, measured by body mass index at 3 years of age, were pressure of suckling, with high-pressure sucking (denoting a vigorous feeding style) associated with greater adiposity, and time of introduction of solid food, with delayed introduction of solid food or breast-feeding longer than 5 months, or both, being associated with greater adiposity. Predictive factors at 6 years of age were adiposity at birth, with greater adiposity at birth predicting greater fatness at 6 years, parental education, with less education associated with fatness, and a prolonged period of breast-feeding with delayed introduction of solid food. These factors accounted for 40.4% of the variance in adiposity at 3 years of age and 31.2% at 6 years. The effects of social learning on body mass index, indicated by parental educational level, appear to strengthen over time, whereas the effects of the vigorous feeding style wane.\r"

Before the establishment of a high school-based clinic, an anonymous needs assessment survey was completed by 600 adolescents (grades 9 to 12). Sociodemographic information was obtained and questions were asked about physical and sexual abuse, health-related behaviors and habits, and suicide attempts. Thirteen percent of the adolescents had been maltreated: 5.2% reported prior physical abuse, 5.4% sexual abuse, and 2.7% both physical and sexual abuse. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to clarify how previous abuse was related to adolescent risk-taking behaviors and suicide. Students with a history of physical abuse were three times more likely than non-abused peers to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes, almost twice as likely to use illicit drugs, six times more likely to self-induce vomiting, and five times more likely to attempt suicide. A student with a history of prior sexual abuse had a three and one-half times greater chance of being sexually active and was more than three times more likely to attempt suicide. These data on a nonclinical, nondeviant population of adolescents indicate that physical or sexual abuse in childhood may have a significant impact on adolescent health risk behaviors and suicide attempts.\r"

A standardized format was used to collect drawings, administer the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and gather background data on medical, developmental, and child-rearing issues. Seven alleged sexual abuse victims and one comparison child spontaneously drew genitalia (p = 0.02, one-tailed Fisher Exact Test, estimated relative risk 7.96). No differences in drawing maturity (Draw-A-Man score) were identified, although Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores were higher in comparison children (82.1 vs. 91.0, p less than 0.01). Neither drawing genitalia nor history of alleged sexual abuse were significantly associated with histories of medical problems, enuresis, encopresis, urinary tract infection, or child-rearing practices related to sleeping, nudity, bathing, sexual abuse education, or exposure to sexually explicit materials. The similar patterns of child-rearing practices in both samples should make professionals cautious in attributing allegations of abuse to specific child-rearing practices. This study confirms our previous report that the presence of genitalia spontaneously drawn on a child's drawing of a human figure is associated with alleged sexual abuse.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of the different sensitivity of Purkinje and myocardial fibers to strophanthidin was studied in these tissues isolated from the same hearts. Membrane potentials, force and, in some experiments, intracellular sodium activity were recorded under conditions that vary the sodium load in the absence and presence of strophanthidin. Strophanthidin (0.1-0.3 microM) increased force in percent terms more and at a faster rate in Purkinje than in myocardial fibers. Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 2 microM) markedly reduced whereas high [Na]o (176.6 mM) and veratridine (0.2 microM) potentiated strophanthidin inotropy in Purkinje but not in myocardial fibers. The rate of force development was augmented by high [Na]o and veratridine in Purkinje fibers but in myocardial fibers this effect was absent with high [Na]o and smaller with veratridine. Strophanthidin increased the action potential duration at plateau level in Purkinje and decreased it in myocardial fibers. The effects of TTX, high [Na]o and veratridine on the action potential were more pronounced in Purkinje than in myocardial fibers. TTX decreased far more and adding strophanthidin increased intracellular sodium activity (aiNa) less in Purkinje fibers. Strophanthidin increased aiNa to a similar extent in the presence of high [Na]o and veratridine in the two tissues. Thus, changes in Na influx modify the action potential duration, force and strophanthidin inotropy more in Purkinje than in myocardial fibers. This greater sensitivity of Purkinje fibers to strophanthidin does not appear to be related to a larger increase in aiNa, but rather to the changes in action potential (and consequent changes in calcium influx).\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics and neurochemical effects of repeated fenfluramine administration in rats (1-24 mg/kg s.c., b.i.d. for 4 days) were examined with respect to dose dependence, regional specificity and time course of recovery. Fenfluramine administration resulted in parallel increases in plasma and brain concentrations of the drug and its metabolite, norfenfluramine, which were dose-related but nonlinear. Doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg fenfluramine increased brain serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid with no significant effects on 5-HT uptake sites. Higher doses of fenfluramine (4-24 mg/kg) reduced all three brain 5-HT markers with maximal decreases (80%-90%) occurring at 12 mg/kg. High-dose (24 mg/kg) fenfluramine administration led to larger decreases in 5-HT markers in neocortex, striatum and hippocampus than in hypothalamus, brain stem and spinal cord. Following 80% to 90% reductions of the 5-HT markers in neocortex and hippocampus at 18 hr after drug treatment, 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid returned to control levels by 4 and 16 weeks, respectively, but 5-HT uptake sites initially recovered more slowly, with a 25% reduction still evident at 8 months. At this time 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were again reduced. Fenfluramine administration produced dose-dependent and biphasic effects on brain dopamine markers. Increases in homovanillic acid levels were apparent at 2 hr, whereas decreases in the levels of dopamine, homovanillic acid and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were evident at 18 hr post-treatment. Norepinephrine levels were only decreased by doses of fenfluramine greater than or equal to 4 mg/kg. Fenfluramine administration did not cause long-term alterations in dopamine or norepinephrine uptake sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, the thromboxane receptor antagonist, daltroban, (30 mg/kg/day i.p.) or vehicle was administered to rats for 3 weeks starting 2 weeks after partial renal ablation (right uninephrectomy and ligation of approximately two-thirds of the blood supply to the left kidney). Renal ablation was associated with proteinuria and increased systolic blood pressure. Neither the proteinuria nor the hypertension was affected by daltroban administration. Histological examination of the remaining kidney demonstrated no beneficial effect of daltroban. In a second study, it was determined that, 2 weeks after renal ablation, urinary thromboxane excretion was significantly increased, and subsequent administration of daltroban for 2 weeks resulted in significant blockade of the effects of the thromboxane mimetic, U46619. In a third study, enalapril (50 mg/l in the drinking water) resulted in a significant attenuation of the proteinuria, hypertension and glomerular lesions associated with partial renal ablation. The data indicate that enalapril, but not daltroban, protects against the development of renal disease associated with reduced renal mass.\r"

Moreover, the tricyclic derivatives antagonized muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity with similar potency in the corpus striatum and heart, and there was good agreement between the affinities of the tricyclic derivatives when measured by radioligand binding and by antagonism of the adenylate cyclase response.

Recently, we have shown that butoxyacetic acid (BAA) is the proximate hemolytic agent and that inhibition of alcohol or aldehyde dehydrogenases protected rats against BE-induced hemolytic anemia. In the present investigations, the kinetics of 14C-BE metabolism and clearance were studied in control adult (3-4 months old) and old (12-13 months old) male F344 rats and in adult male F344 rats treated with pyrazole, cyanamide or probenecid. Our results showed that the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic clearance (Cls) of BE were dose-dependent. In contrast, there was no effect of dose on half-life (T1/2) or volume of distribution (Vd) of BE. These results also showed that there was no age effect on T1/2, Vd or Cls of BE. However, Cmax and AUC of BE increased as a function of age. Also, analysis of variance indicated no significant interactions (P less than or equal to .05) between dose and age in relation to BE kinetics. As expected, inhibition of BE metabolism by pretreatment of rats with pyrazole or cyanamide resulted in a significant increase in the T1/2 and AUC of BE, whereas it caused a significant decrease in the Cls. Furthermore, pyrazole had no effect, whereas cyanamide had decreased Vd of BE. Analysis of the toxicokinetic parameters of BAA revealed that T1/2, AUC and Cmax of BAA were directly related to the age of the rats and the dose of BE administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DPDPE and DAMGO were used as selective agonists for delta and mu subtypes of opioid receptors, respectively, whereas U50,488H [trans-(+-)-3,4-dichloro-N-Me-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl]-benzene-acedamid+ ++ e- methanesulfonate] and U69,593 [(5 alpha, 7 alpha, 8 beta)-(-)-N-methyl-N-(7-(1-pyrrolidiny)-1- oxa-spiro-(4,5)-dec-8-yl]-benzeaneacetamide] were used as selective agonists at the kappa-opioid receptor. When added to the serosal medium of intact tissues, DPDPE, DAMGO, U50,488H and morphine, but not U69,593, produced a concentration-dependent reduction of basal transmural potential difference and short-circuit current (Isc), and an increase in tissue conductance. DPDPE was 41-, 341- and 476-fold more potent than DAMGO, U50,488H and morphine, respectively, in producing these effects, although all these compounds were equiefficacious. DPDPE, but not DAMGO, U50,488H or U69,593, caused a similar effect on basal Isc when added to the mucosal medium. Naloxone produced a rightward shift in the concentration-effect curve for DAMGO and DPDPE, yielding distinct Ke values for naloxone of 9.7 +/- 0.5 and 42.9 +/- 7.9 nM, respectively. In contrast, ICI 174,864, a delta-selective antagonist, blocked the Isc response induced by DPDPE but not DAMGO. The Isc response of U50,488H, however, was neither blocked nor reversed by naloxone or ICI 174,864, nor blocked by norbinaltorphimine, suggesting that the response was not mediated via opioid receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Baroreflex responses consisted of reflex bradycardia elicited during pressor responses to methoxamine and reflex tachycardia during depressor responses to sodium nitroprusside. As we have shown previously, all reflex heart rate responses were initially smaller in 15-month-old than in 5-month old rats. Osmotic minipumps filled with saline or verapamil (100 micrograms/kg/day) were connected to cannulas in a lateral ventricle or femoral vein and, after 6 days, baroreflexes were recorded again. Control infusions of either saline intracerebroventricularly or verapamil intravenously were ineffective. In contrast, intracerebroventricular infusions of verapamil attenuated reflex heart rate responses to methoxamine or sodium nitroprusside differently in the two age groups: both reflex tachycardia and bradycardia were attenuated in 5-month-old rats; however, in 15-month-old rats only reflex bradycardia was reduced, whereas reflex tachycardia was unaffected. The selective reduction of reflex tachycardia in 5-month-old, but not in 15-month-old, rats suggests that intracerebroventricularly infused verapamil affects central baroreflex regulation differently depending on age.\r"

  ".W": "Some tertiary antimuscarinic amines related to oxotremorine were compared with atropine and scopolamine for their ability to block physostigmine-induced hypertension and acetylcholine-induced hypotension in rats. These cardiovascular responses are mediated via muscarinic receptors in the brainstem and on the vasculature, respectively. In urethane-anesthetized rats, physostigmine (77 nmol/kg i.v.) increased mean arterial pressure 40 +/- 5 mm Hg. One hour later, each rat received a single dose of antimuscarinic, then a second bolus of physostigmine 10 min later. Linear regression analysis of antagonist dose-percent inhibition curves showed that all the agents inhibited physostigmine's pressor effect, thus indicating an ability to antagonize brain muscarinic receptors. BM-5 and BoK-1 were estimated to be equipotent with atropine, all having 50% inhibitory doses (ID50) in the 1.5 to 1.8 mumol/kg range. BR-370 and DKJ-21 were 3- and 30-fold less potent, respectively, than atropine in this assay, while scopolamine was the most potent (ID50: 0.039 mumol/kg). In contrast with atropine and scopolamine, the oxotremorine analogs possessed selective central antimuscarinic effects and were completely unable to antagonize the peripheral depressor response. Like atropine, only BM-5 showed significant tachycardiac effects, which suggested that this agent possessed affinity for myocardial muscarinic receptors. These findings support the concept that congeners of oxotremorine behave as centrally selective antimuscarinics at doses which have low peripheral antimuscarinic activity in vivo. This unique pharmacological profile makes them novel probes to study central cholinergic muscarinic mechanisms in cardiovascular regulation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the secondary mediators responsible for the cardiac effects of C5a. Recombinant human C5a (rhC5a) caused dose-dependent tachycardia, slowing of atrioventricular nodal conduction, a short lasting increase followed by a prolonged decrease in left ventricular contractility, and coronary vasoconstriction. These changes were associated with the release of histamine, thromboxane A2 and adenosine into the coronary effluent. Our data indicate that the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of rhC5a are mediated by histamine release and consequent activation of H2-receptors, the coronary-vasoconstricting effect is due to thromboxane release and the negative dromotropic effect is associated with adenosine release. Furthermore, the decrease in contractility caused by rhC5a is likely to result from the H1-mediated negative inotropic effect of histamine compounded by the ischemic conditions created by the coronary vasoconstricting effects of thromboxane A2 and, perhaps, leukotrienes. Our findings demonstrate that C5a has marked cardiac effects at concentrations approximating those attained in vivo in a multitude of pathophysiological conditions in which complement is activated, including myocardial infarction. Thus, anaphylatoxins may play a role in the development of ischemic cardiac dysfunction.\r"

Physical characteristics of these reflex receptors differ and thus they may respond differently to polar and neutral cardenolides. Our purpose was to determine the effect of progressive i.v. infusion of either ASI-222, a polar aminocardenolide agent, or digoxin, a neutral cardenolide, on cardiac sympathetic, efferent vagal, and carotid sinus nerve activity. Digoxin or ASI-222 were infused into anesthetized dogs at dose rates which caused cardiac arrhythmias in about 2 hr. Nerve activities were monitored and recorded by a system of differential amplifiers and by a digital storage oscilloscope. Infusion of ASI-222 progressively reduced sympathetic nerve activity (approximately 55%) through the toxic dose; sympathetic nerve activity remained depressed even through the onset of cardiac arrhythmias. Digoxin also depressed cardiac sympathetic nerve activity but only at intermediate dose levels; sympathetic activity rose near the toxic dose. Digoxin increased both carotid sinus and vagal efferent nerve activity with progressive doses. In contrast, ASI-222 did not alter carotid sinus and efferent vagal nerve activity. In summary, digoxin activates carotid sinus baroreceptors; ASI-222 does not. Digoxin and ASI-222 produce different profiles of changes in cardiac autonomic nerve activity and appear to differ in autonomic reflex receptor interactions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA) on muscarinic receptor downregulation and internalization in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells were determined. Downregulation was assessed by measuring [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to intact cells. PMA alone did not induce muscarinic receptor downregulation but instead decreased markedly both the rate and final extent of downregulation induced by the agonist carbachol. The specificity of various analogs for inhibiting carbachol-induced downregulation indicated involvement of protein kinase C. Furthermore the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine prevented the inhibitory effect of PMA on downregulation. In contrast, staurosporine did not inhibit agonist-induced downregulation. Neither agonist-induced downregulation nor the inhibitory effect of PMA were blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis is not required for these effects. Muscarinic receptor internalization was assessed both by sucrose density gradient centrifugation assays of receptor subcellular distribution and by measuring binding of the hydrophilic radioligand N-[3H]methylscopolamine to intact cells at reduced temperature. PMA did not induce muscarinic receptor internalization but rather inhibited internalization induced by the agonist carbachol. Together these results suggest that activation of protein kinase C leads to inhibition of an agonist-induced increase in the rates of muscarinic receptor internalization and degradation that are presumably responsible for receptor redistribution and eventual downregulation.\r"

  ".W": "Despite comparable alcohol consumption, not all women who drink excessively give birth to children with fetal alcohol effects or the fetal alcohol syndrome. Various maternal factors may be important in this regard. For example, two recent animal studies found that maternal age was an important risk factor in regard to alcohol's adverse effects on pregnancy. Specifically, alcohol produced greater maternal and fetal toxicity in older and middle-age mothers than in younger cohorts. An age-related difference in maternal blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), despite comparable alcohol administration, may have been the major factor. That is, older mothers may achieve higher BACs or take longer to eliminate alcohol from their blood, resulting in greater maternal and fetal toxicity. The present study was conducted to investigate this possibility. Dams were of three age groups: 2 1/4, 3 3/4 and 5 1/4 months old. Alcohol (3.5 g/kg p.o.) was administered twice daily at a 6-hr interval from gestation days 11 to 19. Blood samples were obtained on gestation day 19 at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hr after each injection. The data showed a progressive increase in peak BACs and a prolonged presence of alcohol with increasing maternal age. It was subsequently hypothesized that age-related differences in percent body water content might account for these effects, and we tested for this possibility. While age-related differences in body water content were found, administering alcohol doses on the basis of body water content did not equate BAC curves across the maternal age groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

NO was quantified using a sensitive and specific ozone redox-chemiluminescence detector. Endogenously produced NO was detected in the headspace gas of bovine vascular endothelial homogenates supplemented with superoxide dismutase and an NADPH regenerating system, which had been incubated at 0 degrees C for 3 hr. An identical system incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 hr did not produce NO. Both superoxide dismutase and an NADPH regenerating system were required for observing endogenous NO production from endothelial homogenates. Among the various endothelial subcellular fractions tested, only the 1000 x g supernatant manifested significant generation of endogenous NO. Addition of 1.4 mM L-arginine (but not D-arginine, L-citrulline or L-lysine) resulted in significant enhancement of NO production from the 15,500 and 210,000 x g pellet fractions. L-arginine did not stimulate NO production from either homogenates or subcellular fractions of coronary vascular smooth muscle cells. Exogenously added calcium or magnesium was not required for NO generation in the 210,000 x g pellet stimulated with L-arginine, whereas L-canavanine (1.4 mM) and SKF 525-A (0.1 mM) significantly inhibited NO production with this preparation. Analysis of the enzyme marker data from various subcellular fractions suggests that the endothelial NO-generating enzyme system is membrane-bound and might be associated with the plasma membrane.\r"

Different CGRPs identified above produced a concentration-dependent fall in the resting tension of the IAS. CGRP II (human) was most potent, while [Tyr0]-CGRP (rat) was the least. The fall in IAS tension caused by CGRP II (human) was not modified by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, beta adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin. In contrast to the other CGRP analogs, [Tyr0]-CGRP 28-37 (rat) produced no significant effects on the resting tension of the IAS. However, the fragment caused significant rightward shifts in the concentration-effect curves of different CGRP analogs examined on the IAS. [Tyr0]-CGRP 28-37 (rat) was found to be almost equipotent in antagonizing the inhibitory effects of CGRP (rat) and [Tyr0]-CGRP (rat), but was approximately 12 and 4 times more potent in antagonizing the responses of CGRP I (human) and CGRP II (human), respectively, as compared to that of CGRP (rat) and [Tyr0]-CGRP (rat). Calcitonin, on the other hand, caused a rise in the IAS tension by its action directly at the smooth muscle and this was not modified by [Tyr0]-CGRP 28-37. Thus, we conclude that: 1) CGRP causes a fall in the resting tension of IAS by its action directly at the smooth muscle; 2) [Tyr0]-CGRP 28-37 (rat) may serve as an antagonist of CGRP responses and 3) CGRP and calcitonin produce opposite actions on the resting IAS tension by the activation of their own receptors at the smooth muscle cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To study the epigenetic regulation of beta adrenergic receptor subtypes, we examined the effects of phorbol esters on beta adrenergic receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, which express both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes. Pretreatment of intact 3T3-L1 cells with the protein kinase C activator phorbol dibutyrate caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in subsequent cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation mediated by the beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. This effect was selective for beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated responses because there was a potentiation of cAMP accumulation caused by other activators such as prostaglandin E1, forskolin or cholera toxin. The inactive phorbol, alpha-phorbol dibutyrate was ineffective at 1 microM in attenuating isoproterenol stimulation, and 25 nM of the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine blocked the effects of phorbol ester on beta adrenergic agonist responses. Stimulation of cAMP accumulation by isoproterenol occurred through a greater proportion of beta-2 adrenergic receptors in phorbol dibutyrate-treated cells than in control cells. This was demonstrated using the beta-1 adrenergic selective antagonist ICI 89.406 and the beta-2 adrenergic selective antagonist ICI 118.551 to inhibit competitively isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Beta-2 adrenergic receptor number and subtype in these cells are regulated by glucocorticoids and butyrate. Decreasing the proportion of beta-1 adrenergic receptors and concomitantly increasing beta-2 adrenergic receptors with either glucocorticoids or butyrate decreased the ability of phorbol ester pretreatment to attenuate cAMP accumulation by isoproterenol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of plasma protein binding displacement on brequinar pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, tumor distribution and antitumor efficacy were evaluated. Sodium salicylate and ibuprofen increased the percentage of free brequinar in serum in vitro, in proportion to their added concentrations. Sodium salicylate also altered the pharmacokinetics of i.v. brequinar in rats when adminstered i.v. or p.o. at 10- or 50-fold higher doses than brequinar. At the highest salicylate/brequinar dose ratio, significant increases were observed for terminal half-life, mean residence times in the body and tissues, systemic clearance, distribution clearance, the volume of the central compartment and volume of distribution at steady state. Neither salicylate nor ibuprofen increased brequinar concentrations in lung and muscle specimens from rats, 4 or 24 hr after dosing. Tumor, lung and muscle brequinar concentrations in mice were also unaffected by coadministered sodium salicylate, 4 or 24 hr after a single i.v. brequinar dose. In rats infused for 48 hr with brequinar or brequinar plus salicylate, salicylate increased the percentage of free brequinar in plasma and lungs, but total brequinar concentrations were reduced. Antitumor efficacy was evaluated by measuring the survival times of mice implanted with L1210 leukemia cells. Salicylate-treated mice had a similar brequinar dose/response profile as mice not coadministered salicylate. Ibuprofen also did not increase brequinar's antitumor potency.\r"

The average number of drinks constituting each peak was significantly greater for the heavy and moderate drinkers than for the occasional drinkers (P less than .05). The interval between successive peaks in alcohol consumption averaged 4.6 (+/- 0.8) days for the occasional drinkers, 3.2 (+/- 0.2) days for the moderate drinkers and 3.6 (+/- 0.17) days for the heavy drinkers but these differences were not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was performed to determine the subtypes of histamine receptors that are involved in the electrophysiological, inotropic and biochemical responses to histamine in isolated rabbit papillary muscles. Histamine increased force of contraction and shortened action potential duration (APD) in a concentration-dependent manner. The former was antagonized by chlorpheniramine, a H1-antagonist, whereas the latter was blocked by cimetidine, a H2-antagonist. However, even when H1-receptors were blocked entirely by chlorpheniramine, histamine still produced a positive inotropic effect, an effect which was antagonized by cimetidine. On the other hand, when H2-receptors were eliminated by cimetidine, histamine caused a H1-receptor mediated APD prolongation. Carbachol attenuated the decrease in APD but not the increase in force of contraction caused by histamine. Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels both were elevated significantly by histamine. The increase in cyclic AMP level induced by histamine was abolished by cimetidine, but not altered by chlorpheniramine, whereas the converse was true for the increase in cyclic GMP level. Additionally, histamine produced a significant stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis as measured by [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation, although its extent was far less than that produced by carbachol. The phosphoinositide response to histamine was blocked by chlorpheniramine. These data suggest that H1- and H2-receptors coexist in rabbit ventricles. Stimulation of H1- and H2-receptors with histamine independently sets off the biochemical responses linked specifically to the respective subtypes of histamine receptors. On the other hand, the inotropic and electrophysiological responses to histamine are governed predominantly by H1- and H2-receptors, respectively, and this results in an apparent restriction of the expression of the responses mediated by another subtype.\r"

Prolonged incubation with carbachol attenuated phospholipase C responsiveness to muscarinic agonists and decreased the number of cell surface mAChR, as measured by binding of N-[3H] methylscopolamine to neuronal monolayers. When neurons were exposed to carbachol for 15 min, 40% of the mAChR lost from the membrane domain was recovered in the cytosol; a decrease of the total neuronal receptors was detected following an incubation with the agonist lasting longer than 15 min. Both 8-Br-cyclic AMP and forskolin neither affected N-[3H]methylscopolamine binding to cell monolayers or did they prevent the agonist-mediated mAChR desensitization. 8-Br-cyclic GMP also failed to decrease mAChR number. Pertussis toxin failed to prevent the homologous desensitization of mAChR under conditions that blocked the agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP formation. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-12, 13-acetate induced a concentration-dependent decrease of N-[3H]methylscopolamine binding to neuronal monolayers. However, the protein kinase C inhibitors sphingosine and the ganglioside monosialosyl-gangliotetraglicosylceramide inhibited the 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-12,13-acetate-induced but not the agonist-induced desensitization of mAChRs. Furthermore, incubation with muscarinic agonists failed to translocate protein kinase C from cytosol to plasma membranes, as measured by binding of the phorbol ester [3H]-4-beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate to neuronal monolayers. In corticostriatal neurons the agonist-induced desensitization and internalization of mAChR involves neither protein kinase C and protein kinase A activation nor changes in cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP content.\r"

Inactin-anesthetized rats, responses to B-HT 933 (20 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) were compared in the chronically denervated kidney with responses in the contralateral innervated kidney. Plasma vasopressin concentration was maintained at high physiological levels by constant infusion of arginine vasopressin (170 pg/kg/min, i.v.). Control rats received arginine vasopressin and saline only. Arterial pressure and heart rate were decreased significantly by B-HT 933 (12 mm Hg and 80 beats/min. respectively). Glomerular filtration rate was not altered in innervated or denervated kidneys, whereas renal blood flow was decreased slightly, but significantly, in denervated but not innervated kidneys. B-HT 933 increased urine flow and total and fractional sodium excretion significantly in innervated kidneys but not in denervated kidneys when compared with control animals. Urine osmolality was also decreased significantly in innervated kidneys, but remained hyperosmotic to plasma. The data indicate that, in the presence of fixed levels of arginine vasopressin, chronic renal denervation prevented the natriuretic and diuretic effect of B-HT 933 in anesthetized rats. These results suggest that central and/or peripheral effects of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor activation were involved in producing natriuresis in the innervated kidney by decreasing renal sympathetic nerve influence on tubular sodium reabsorption.\r"

Under constant pressure conditions, the arrest of coronary flow and the reduction of ventricular contraction during global ischemia were readily reversible and quickly returned at reperfusion. During ischemia, however, a diastolic contracture developed, which was slowly reversible upon reperfusion. The calcium antagonists studied appeared to delay and diminish in a concentration-dependent way the diastolic contracture during ischemia. Furthermore, they accelerated the reduction of this contracture at reperfusion. Nifedipine, bepridil and quaternary bepridil showed a 100 to 1000 times higher potency in accelerating the recovery of the diastolic contracture during the reperfusion phase than in reducing the development of diastolic tension during the ischemic period itself, whereas verapamil hardly discriminated these two phases. When the hearts were reperfused with nifedipine under constant flow conditions, reduction of the diastolic contracture during ischemia could still be observed, but the accelerated reduction of end-diastolic pressure during reperfusion was no longer present. The results are discussed in relation to the energy saving, negative inotropic activity of the drugs before the ischemic period and the strong coronary vasodilation, which seems to be involved in the protective activity of the drugs, especially during reperfusion.\r"

Intracellular recordings were made from cornus ammoni-1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices. Responses to eltoprazine were compared with 5HT-induced responses. Superfusion with 5HT induced a dose-dependent hyperpolarization of the membrane accompanied by a resistance decrease. Eltoprazine evoked membrane changes that were similar to but much weaker than those induced by 5HT. Both the 5HT- and eltoprazine-evoked membrane hyperpolarizations were largely suppressed in the presence of spiperone. The eltoprazine-induced effects persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium and also when haloperidol and phentolamine were added to the medium, indicating that the small agonistic effects of eltoprazine are not due to an indirect activation of dopamine or alpha adrenergic receptors. Superfusion with eltoprazine furthermore resulted in a marked reduction of the response to concomitantly applied 5HT. Dose-response curves for 5HT were shifted to the right in the presence of eltoprazine, while the maximal response was diminished. Hyperpolarizations induced by baclofen, which presumably activates the same K+ conductance as 5HT, were not significantly reduced by eltoprazine. Our data, added to the previously demonstrated high affinity of eltoprazine for 5HT1 sites, suggest that in the hippocampal cornus ammoni-1 area eltoprazine acts as a partial 5HT1 agonist with a relatively low intrinsic activity but a considerable potency to suppress hyperpolarizing responses to 5HT.\r"

These tetrodotoxin-sensitive responses, which were mediated by release of one or more tachykinins, were inhibited by adenosine analogs in a concentration-dependent manner. The rank order of potencies of the analogs as inhibitors of the responses to cholecystokinin octapeptide was N6-cyclopentyladenosine greater than 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine much greater than 2-phenylaminoadenosine (CV 1808). Schild analysis of the antagonism of the presynaptic inhibitory effects of 5'-N-ethylcarbocamidoadenosine and N6-cyclopentyladenosine on cholecystokinin octapeptide-stimulated responses using the A1 selective antagonists 1,3-dipropyl-8-(4-sulfophenyl)xanthine and 1,3-dipropyl-8-(cyclopentyl)xanthine yielded linear isoboles with unit slopes indicating competitive antagonism. The affinity of the antagonists for the receptor site(s) involved in inhibition of tachykininergic transmission was similar to those established previously for cholinergic transmission. The rank order of potency of adenosine analogs as inhibitors of the field-stimulated responses was such that N6-cyclopentyladenosine = 5'-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis performed on lysates of isolated myenteric nerve endings demonstrated the presence of substance P and neurokinin-A. Neurokinin-B was undetectable. These studies indicate that adenosine receptor(s) on myenteric nerve endings are coupled negatively to tachykinin release and that they are probably identical to those involved in the modulation of acetylcholine release.\r"

Mechanical parameters were determined from the contraction and relaxation phases under isotonic and isometric conditions in order to assess contraction, relaxation, contraction-relaxation coupling and load sensitivity of relaxation. The peak power output Emax was determined from the force-velocity relationship. At 10(-6) M, a slight positive inotropic effect was observed, probably related to modifications in cross-bridges kinetics. Negative inotropic effects were observed with 10(-5) and 10(-4) M chlorpromazine. At 10(-5) M, shortening of the isometric relaxation and decrease in R2 = (+dF.dt-1max)/(-dF.dt-1max) suggest that chlorpromazine also diminishes myofilament Ca++ sensitivity. Emax was increased at 10(-6) M (19 +/- 5%, P less than .05), but decreased at 10(-5) M (-28 +/- 10%, P less than .05) and 10(-4) M (-82 +/- 2%, P less than .05). Modifications in the force-velocity relationship at 10(-4) M indicated that lowering myocardial performance by chlorpromazine was associated with a low muscle efficiency from a thermoenergetic point of view. At all concentrations, chlorpromazine impaired the isotonic relaxation and load sensitivity of relaxation. At 10(-4) M, muscle contracture and slowed isometric relaxation were probably due to \"calcium overload.\" These results showed that chlorpromazine finely modulates intrinsic cardiac energetics and mechanics by acting on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, myofilament Ca++ sensitivity and cross-bridges kinetics, according to the level of load and chlorpromazine concentration used.\r"

The effects of cyclosporine binding to lipoproteins were investigated in vivo by the intracarotid injection technique of Oldendorf in the rat. The brain extraction of cyclosporine was related inversely to the lipoprotein concentration in the injected solution, allowing estimation of nKa in vivo: high-density lipoprotein, 2.25 +/- 0.59; low-density lipoprotein, 0.62 +/- 0.13; and very low-density lipoprotein, 0.57 +/- 0.14 liters/g. This showed that brain uptake occurred from the free drug pool and possibly from a small part of the originally lipoprotein-bound pool of cyclosporine, at least for low-density lipoprotein-bound cyclosporine. These results allow the calculation of an index of the unbound plasma cyclosporine fraction.\r"

Two M1-mediated responses elicited by McN-A-343 were studied: relaxation of the isolated rat duodenum and inhibition of twitch contractions in rabbit was deferens. A comparison was made with the affinity of McN-A-343 as an antagonist (KB) of acetylcholine-induced contraction in rat duodenum. Results showed that McN-A-343 displayed similar affinities as an agonist and as an antagonist: -log KA were 4.68 and 5.17 in duodenum and vas deferens, respectively, vs. -log KB of 4.96 in duodenum, indicating that the ability of McN-A-343 to selectively stimulate M1 receptors is not based on a greater affinity for this subtype. In both preparations examined, McN-A-343 reached maximum effect through occupation of a fraction of the total available receptors (approximately 30% in duodenum, approximately 80% in vas deferens), implying that occupation of M1 receptors is translated into effect in a highly efficient way.\r"

  ".W": "The transport mechanisms of beta-lactam antibiotics in the rat kidney and liver were studied with an in vivo tissue-sampling single-injection technique using [3H]benzylpenicillin [( 3H]PCG) as a substrate. Concentration-dependent uptake of [3H]PCG was observed in the kidney, and the in vivo kinetic parameters were estimated as follows: the maximum uptake rate (Jmax) was 6.88 mumol/min/g of kidney, MIchaelis constant (Kt) was 1.39 mM and nonsaturable first-order rate constant (kd) was 0.414 ml/min/g of kidney. The uptake of [3H]PCG was inhibited by organic anions but not by organic cations. Several beta-lactam antibiotics also reduced the uptake of [3H]PCG. Furthermore, the organic anion, probenecid, and beta-lactam antibiotic, cefpiramide, showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect. These results suggest participation of an organic anion transport system in uptake of beta-lactam antibiotics across the renal plasma membrane. Saturable uptake of [3H]PCG was also observed in the liver and Jmax, Kt and Kd were estimated to be 3.62 mumol/min/g of liver, 3.59 mM and 0.223 ml/min/g of liver, respectively. The in vivo influx rate calculated from Jmax/Kt in the liver was 1.01 ml/min/g of liver and was close to the in vitro value, 1.54 ml/min/g of liver, estimated previously from isolated hepatocytes. Although dipeptides and organic cations showed no effect on the hepatic uptake of [3H]PCG, probenecid significantly reduced its uptake. Several beta-lactam antibiotics also reduced the uptake of [3H]PCG by the liver. These features of the hepatic uptake of beta-lactam antibiotics through an organic anion transport system are in agreement with the previous results obtained in isolated hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At endogenous plasma alpha-KG concentration, 2.3 mM plasma lithium caused an increase in the fractional excretion of alpha-KG, whereas 4.6 mM plasma lithium led to a net secretion of alpha-KG. The micropuncture data indicate that this secretion occurred between the late proximal and the distal tubule, i.e., in the pars recta and/or in the loop of Henle. When plasma alpha-KG concentration was elevated, the two doses of lithium used inhibited the reabsorption of alpha-KG both in the proximal tubule and in the pars recta and/or the loop of Henle. Renal arteriovenous measurements reveal that, at low plasma alpha-KG concentrations, lithium caused a significant decrease in both the renal uptake of alpha-KG and the peritubular transport of this organic anion. These results suggest that the alpha-KG secreted in the pars recta and/or the loop of Henle was synthesized within the renal cells of the latter segments and not transported from the blood to the tubular lumen. At higher plasma alpha-KG concentrations, both the peritubular transport and the renal reabsorption were reduced by lithium.\r"

Thus, PAF-acether could be a possible mediator of the reduction of GFR and RPF in ischemic-induced acute renal failure (ARF). We have assayed the effect of inhibiting the interaction of PAF-acether with its receptor using two specific PAF-acether antagonists, BN-52021 and alprazolam, on the evolution of the GFR and RPF, in the experimental model of ARF induced in rats by clamping the left artery for 60 min. In addition, we have measured arteriovenous differences in PAF-acether concentration, as well as PAF-acether content in glomeruli from rats with ARF pretreated or not with BN-52021. In metabolic cage studies, plasma creatinine increased more in the untreated than in the BN-52021-treated group, whereas creatinine clearance was higher in treated than in untreated rats. In acute clearance experiments, after renal artery clamping, untreated rats showed a marked oliguria and reduction of the inulin clearance (greater than 99%), which showed no recovery 90 min after clamp release, whereas GFR reached values above 0.1 ml/min in the rats treated with BN-52021 or alprazolam, with clearly significant statistical differences. Results of p-aminohippurate clearance were similar to those of GFR. Glomeruli from rats with ARF had greater amounts of PAF-acether than glomeruli from normal rats, whereas glomeruli from BN-52021-treated rats with ARF produced intermediate amounts. These results provide evidence for a role for PAF-acether in the genesis of this model of experimental ARF.\r"

In vitro, abecarnil inhibited the binding of the BZ [3H]lormetazepam to rat cerebral cortex membranes with an IC50 value of 0.82 nM in comparison to 56 nM for DZP. The ability of abecarnil to displace [3H]lormetazepam was enhanced 1.24-fold in the presence of 30 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid; the corresponding value for DZP was 2.8-fold. DZP and abecarnil were equally effective in enhancing the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate to rat cortical membranes. In vivo, abecarnil exhibited a 3- to 6-fold higher affinity to forebrain BZ receptors than DZP. Abecarnil was from 2 to 10 times more potent than DZP in most rodent tests of anxiolytic activity, and in reducing locomotor activity in mice and rats thoroughly habituated to the test chamber. However, in rats newly exposed to a novel cage, abecarnil was less potent than DZP in reducing locomotor activity. In tests of motor coordination, abecarnil, in contrast to DZP, showed no or only weak activity, and in potentiating the effects of ethanol and hexobarbital on motor performance abecarnil was 4 to 25 times less potent than DZP. Abecarnil antagonized the effects of BZs in the chimney and loss of righting reflex tests, but not in the rotarod test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The exact mechanism by which these changes occur has not been identified fully, nor have the effects of the drug on the renal microcirculation been studied adequately. In this study, we examined the effect of intrarenal amphotericin B infusions (0.05 mg/kg/min) on glomerular hemodynamics in the anesthetized rat. Amphotericin B did not affect systemic blood pressure and slightly increased hematocrit (5%), but significantly decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate by 40 and 35%, respectively. Glomerular micropuncture revealed decreases in single nephron plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (from 142 +/- 12 to 89 +/- 14 and from 35.3 +/- 2.2 to 22.8 +/- 2.8 nl/min, respectively). These changes were due to significant increases in pre- and postglomerular resistances (from 1.91 +/- 0.17 to 3.95 +/- 0.38 and from 1.30 +/- 0.10 to 2.08 +/- 0.12 10(10) dyn.sec.cm-5, respectively), and to a significant decrease in the glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient which fell from 0.043 +/- 0.008 to 0.032 +/- 0.009 nl/(sec.mm Hg). These results provide further insight into the mechanisms of the acute renal effects of amphotericin B, and suggest possible mediators that may be involved in these effects.\r"

The anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant actions of abecarnil have been evaluated in mice, rats, gerbils and baboons. Abecarnil raised the threshold for tonic electroconvulsions in mice after corneal but not after auricular application, had no effect on maximal electroshock-induced tonic convulsions triggered by either method, protected mice against the tonic hindlimb extension in PTZ-, picrotoxin- and 3-mercaptopropionate-induced seizures and blocked clonus after PTZ, DMCM (methyl-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-9H-pyrido-(3,4-b)-indol-3-carboxylate) and 3-mercaptopropionate. Abecarnil had no effect on convulsions induced by bicuculline and strychnine. Furthermore, abecarnil blocked kindled seizures after chronic administration of PTZ and FG 7142 (beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methylamide) and protected mice and rats against limbic convulsions induced by pilocarpine. Severity and afterdischarge duration of amygdala-kindled seizures were reduced in rats treated with abecarnil. Abecarnil also antagonized selectively convulsions induced by i.c.v. administration of kainate, but not those triggered by N-methyl-D-aspartate or quisqualate. In genetic models of reflex epilepsy, abecarnil was effective against sound-induced convulsions in DBA/2 mice, against air blast-induced generalized seizures in gerbils and against myoclonus in baboons Papio papio. The anticonvulsant effect of abecornil in a PTZ seizure model in mice was potentiated by ethosuximide, whereas no significant potentiation was found with diazepam, clonazepam, diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital.

Autonomic reflexes can attenuate diltiazem's actions and could alter their frequency-dependence. We evaluated the effects of four steady-state drug concentrations in each of seven dogs with intact autonomic tone, six with muscarinic blockade (atropine) and eight with combined muscarinic and beta adrenergic blockade. Diltiazem depressed atrioventricular nodal function less in autonomically intact dogs than in the other two groups. The concentration-response relationship for increases in Wenckebach cycle length (compared to intact dogs) was twice as steep among dogs with muscarinic blockade (P less than .001) and three times as steep with combined blockade (P less than .001). For an equal dose of diltiazem, the slope of drug-induced refractory period prolongation vs. pacing cycle length was similar (-0.20 +/- 0.11%/msec, mean +/- S.D.) in intact dogs compared to atropinized dogs (-0.21 +/- 0.10%/msec) and dogs with combined blockade (-0.24 +/- 0.14%/msec). Amplification of diltiazem's actions by the rapid atrial rate during atrial fibrillation was associated with increases in mean RR interval which were 8.3 times as large as changes in refractory period produced by the drug at slow heart rates. We conclude: 1) autonomic reflexes reduce diltiazem's effect for any given plasma concentration; 2) changes in vagal tone can play an important role in the autonomic response to diltiazem; and 3) despite altering the magnitude of diltiazem's effects, autonomic mechanisms do not prevent frequency-dependent drug action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The profile of drug metabolizing activities with imipramine, diazepam, hexobarbital, lidocaine, p-nitroanisole and androstenedione as substrates in old (27-month-old) male rats was almost identical to that in young or old female rats, indicating that neonatal androgenic imprinting of drug metabolism in male rats was erased in senescence. Castration of adult (9-month-old) male rats caused a decrease in drug metabolism, but did not result in complete feminization of the profiles of drug metabolism as was observed in old male rats, indicating that neonatally imprinted male pattern of drug metabolism was still retained in the absence of testosterone in adult male rats. Testosterone administration restored completely male-level activities in castrated adult rats, but caused only a partial recovery in old male rats. It is proposed that senescence associated feminization of the drug-metabolizing ability of the male rat liver may be in part due to the decrease in testosterone levels in old age and in part to the loss of neonatal imprinting.\r"

Our neurochemical experiments focused primarily on the striatum; however, quantitative autoradiography was used to measure D-1 and D-2 DA receptors in both cell body and terminal regions of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways. After receiving eight once-daily injections of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), rats remained behaviorally sensitized for 1 week. This repeated treatment with cocaine induced two changes consistent with increased dopaminergic transmission. Postsynaptic D-2 DA receptors were selectively increased in nucleus accumbens one day after termination of the repeated cocaine administration; however, these receptors returned to control levels one week after cocaine administration had been terminated. In contrast, amphetamine-stimulated [3H] DA release from striatal slices was increased in rats receiving repeated cocaine injections, but this increase was not apparent until 1 week after the drug administration had been terminated. While neither of these two changes is sufficient to explain cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization, both are consistent with increased dopaminergic responsiveness and may contribute to sensitization.\r"

The highest concentrations of P 450 IIB1/B2 were found in the lung and in the duodenum; pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase activity was closely correlated with the amounts of P 450 IIB1/B2 in the different organs. P 450 IIE1 was present in liver, kidney and lung, whereas EH was found in liver, intestine and kidney. In humans, P 450 IIIA4 was detected in all tissues investigated; the highest concentrations were found in liver and intestine. The P 450 IIIA4 level was closely correlated with that of erythromycin demethylase and pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase activities. P 450 IIC8-10, IIE1 and IID6 were expressed in liver and intestine, P 450 9 in liver and kidney and P 450 IA2 in liver. EH was identified only in liver, intestine and kidney. In both species, concentrations and total amounts of P 450 isoenzymes and EH were much lower in all extrahepatic tissues than in the liver. Conversely, glutathione-S-transferase-pi was abundant in human intestine and colon compared to liver. Glutathione-S-transferase-mu polymorphism was confirmed in all tissues investigated. This extensive study showed that the pattern of (iso) enzymes was different in all tissues studied; consequently, xenobiotic metabolism would appear to be very different in each type of tissue.\r"

Muscarine (3-100 microM) increased the rate of spontaneous action potentials; it also caused a membrane depolarization and, in voltage-clamp, an inward current. Concentration-effect curves to muscarine were shifted rightwards by pirenzepine (0.03-1 microM) with an estimated KD of 14 nM. The inward current caused by muscarine was voltage-dependent. Between about -50 and (-)-65 mV it was associated with a decrease in membrane conductance, but between -70 and -110 mV it was unaccompanied by any change in membrane conductance. Muscarine was without effect on the action potential afterhyperpolarization, or on a slowly developing inward current evoked by step hyperpolarizations of up to 20 mV from -45 mV. Muscarinic depolarizations or inward currents were reduced reversibly or abolished by a low calcium (0.25 mM)/high magnesium (10 mM) solution. It is concluded that muscarinic excitation of dopaminergic neurons is mediated by M1-like receptors.\r"

In the rostral ventrolateral medulla, clonidine binds not only to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors but also to specific imidazole sites. In order to determine whether a putative imidazole receptor mediates the hypotensive action of clonidine, a series of compounds was tested 1) in vitro for binding affinity at imidazole and alpha-2 sites and 2) in vivo for ability to lower arterial pressure and heart rate when microinjected directly into the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Hypotensive potency was correlated with affinity at imidazole sites (r = 0.84), but not with alpha-2 affinity (r = -0.05). The bradycardia elicited by this series of compounds also correlated with affinity at imidazole receptors (r = 0.89), but not with alpha-2 affinity (r = 0.10). Furthermore, the imidazole idazoxan selectively reversed the fall in arterial pressure elicited by clonidine, whereas SKF-86466, an alpha-2 antagonist which is not an imidazole, failed to attenuate clonidine's action. An imidazole receptor in the rostral ventrolateral medulla appears to mediate the central hypotensive actions of clonidine and related centrally acting imidazoles and may participate in the regulation of arterial pressure and heart rate.\r"

The respective permeability-surface product values were 0.755 +/- 0.152, 0.647 +/- 0.180, 0.329 +/- 0.05 and 0.035 +/- 0.011 ml/min/g. The rank order of brain extraction did not correlate well with the drugs' lipophilicity determined by octanol-buffer partition coefficient. For example, L-365,260 had the highest octanol/buffer partition coefficient, but the lowest brain extraction. Plasma protein binding significantly decreased the uptake by the brain but to a lesser extent than that predicted from the unbound drug fraction in vitro, suggesting that drug binding to plasma protein did not limit the transport of drug through the blood-brain barrier. For one compound, L-364,718, the extraction ratio and permeability-surface product values were increased markedly in CC1(4)-induced hepatic injury. Other disease states, uranyl nitrate-induced renal failure and streptozotocin-induced diabetes, had no apparent effect on the uptake of the compounds tested. The effect of disease state on the brain uptake of drug appeared to be dependent on the type of disease and the type of drug studied.\r"

For comparative purposes and to extend results obtained by others in previous studies, [3H]ACh binding to membrane preparations derived from rat brain and from the electric tissue of Torpedo californica also was characterized. In each case, specific [3H]ACh binding (KD values of about 10 nM) could be fit by linear Scatchard and logit-log curves (slope of the latter of about 1.0) indicating that binding occurred to a single class of noninteracting sites, except that a better fit to PC12 cell membrane binding data was obtained using a two-site model. Quantitation of high-affinity binding sites for [3H]ACh and radiolabeled alpha-bungarotoxin and studies of unlabeled toxin competition for [3H]ACh binding indicated that toxin and agonist sites on TE671 cell or Torpedo membranes were closely related, but that toxin and agonist sites had limited or no physical overlap on PC12 cell or rat brain membranes. Generally, drugs of the bisonium and bis-choline series were more effective inhibitors of [3H]ACh binding to TE671 cell or Torpedo membranes, but nicotine and cytisine interacted with PC12 cell or rat brain sites with highest affinity. These results suggest that nicotinic agonists bind with high affinity to specific, membrane-bound sites on presumptive nicotinic ACh receptors expressed on each of these preparations. Moreover, the data are consistent with structural heterogeneity of these nicotinic receptor sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

LTD4 (0.1-3 micrograms/kg i.v.), in contrast, increased arterial blood pressure, lowered cardiac rate and produced little change in arterial blood leukocyte count. Continuous infusion of LY255283 [(1-(5-ethyl-2-hydroxy-4-(6-methyl-6-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)- heptyloxy)phenyl)ethanone] (0.33 mg/kg/min i.v.), a selective LTB4 receptor antagonist, resulted in near complete inhibition of leukopenic, hypotensive and tachycardic responses to LTB4 (3 micrograms/kg i.v.) challenge over a 6-hr test period. Persistent antagonism of canine LTB4 receptors was associated with high circulating levels of LY255283 that were bound extensively to plasma proteins. In subsequent experiments, myocardial infarct size was measured following 1 hr of occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery and 5 hr of reperfusion in control dogs infused with vehicle, and in dogs receiving LY255283 (0.33 mg/kg/min i.v.). Drug and vehicle were infused continuously beginning 15 min before coronary artery occlusion. LY255283 treatment essentially did not alter base-line cardiovascular parameters or myocardial oxygen demand when alterations were compared to time-related changes observed in control dogs. LY255283 infusion also did not alter the degree of myocardial ischemia or the intensity and duration of cardiac arrhythmias associated with coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Resultant infarct sizes were 43 +/- 5% of the left ventricle placed at risk in control dogs and 32 +/- 5% in dogs given LY255283; this difference was not statistically significant. The extent of left ventricle placed at risk was similar between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Chronic intrathecal infusion of the highly selective mu agonist, [NMPhe3, D-Pro4]morphiceptin produced a rapid onset of tolerance to the drug in the analgesic test. However, membrane prepared from the spinal cords of the rats chronically infused with a low dose of the drug showed no statistically significant change in the number of mu or delta receptor binding sites. In addition, membrane prepared from rats challenged with a single high-dose bolus injection of [NMPhe3, D-Pro4]morphiceptin did not produce alterations in the receptor binding number. If the chronically treated rats were challenged with an acute bolus dose of [NMPhe3, D-Pro4]morphiceptin, there was a significant decrease in the number of binding sites. The reduced binding site number was observed for the mu ligand but not for the delta ligand. A similar decrease of receptor binding can also be achieved by chronic infusion of the drug at high doses. Scatchard plot showed a decrease of maximum mu binding sites in the membranes prepared from the combined chronic infusion-acute injection treated rats. Brain tissue from the same rats showed no change in the number of mu and delta receptor binding sites, indicating that the down-regulation of mu receptors was confined to the spinal cord only. Morphine did not induce receptor down-regulation by acute, chronic or combined treatments. These results suggest that in the rat spinal cord, tolerance can be induced without apparent receptor down-regulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, in the prostate of the treated rats, despite reductions in the activity of heme oxygenase and that of enzymes of heme biosynthetic pathway, biotransformation of benzo(a)pyrene and ethoxyresorufin and cytochrome P-450 concentration were not altered. cis-Platinum treatment (7 days) also decreased markedly the serum and testicular testosterone levels (50-70%). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 25 IU/100 g/day for 7 days) given to the treated rats (7 days) caused a 5- to 15-fold increase in the serum and testicular testosterone levels and reversed the spectrum of the aforementioned inhibitory effects of cis-platinum on heme metabolic enzymes. The response of the testis and prostate drug metabolic activities to hCG treatment also differed. In the testis of cis-platinum-treated rats, the inhibited AHH and 7-ERDE activities were reversed by hCG treatment and cytochrome P-450 concentration returned to the control level. In the prostate, however, hCG treatment neither changed AHH and 7-ERDE activities nor the concentration of the microsomal cytochrome P-450. In addition, in the testis the pattern of response of AHH and 7-ERDE activities to hCG was dissimilar; whereas 7-ERDE activity returned to the normal level, AHH activity surpassed the normal activity and reached a near 2.5-fold increase over the control value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The dithiothreitol (10 mM) eliminated the potentiation of both adrenergic neurotransmission and PGE synthesis but did not alter the depression of purinergic neurotransmission. In contrast, pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 3 hr) eliminated the depression of purinergic neurotransmission but had no effect on adrenergic neurotransmission or PGE synthetic responses to angiotensin II. The results are consistent with the existence of at least two transduction pathways for angiotensin II, one enhancing adrenergic neurotransmission and PGE synthesis and the other depressing purinergic neurotransmission.

Ang II infusion (125 ng/min i.p. for 12 days) in rats drinking 0.15 M NaCl resulted in severe hypertension accompanied by proteinuria, reduction of urinary creatinine excretion and augmentation of urinary TxB2 excretion and TxB2 release from aortic rings and renal cortex slices. In saline-drinking rats undergoing Ang II infusion, the concomitant administration by gavage of UK 38485 (100 mg/kg/day) or SC 41156 (25 mg/kg/day) reduced serum and urinary TxB2 and TxB2 release from aortic rings and/or renal cortex slices, but it was without effect on the development of hypertension. In contrast, concomitant infusion of SQ 29548 (4.2 mg/24 hr s.c.) significantly attenuated the increase of blood pressure produced by the infusion of Ang II in saline-drinking rats. This effect of SQ 29548 may be the consequence of blockade of the actions of one or more endogenous eicosanoids that increase blood pressure by a mechanism(s) involving interaction with TxA2 receptors. This implies that pressor eicosanoids play a contributory role in the development of severe Ang II-salt hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "90230176\r", 
  ".W": "Evidence is provided in this manuscript that ethanol acts directly on neurons in the medial septal area (MSA). Initially, the electrophysiological characteristics of MSA neurons in freely moving rats were characterized and found similar to that observed in rats anesthetized with urethane, but not chloral hydrate. Therefore, urethane was used to evaluate the effects of ethanol in anesthetized rats. The conclusion that ethanol influences neural function in the MSA is based on electrophysiological data that ethanol (0.75-3.0 g/kg i.p.) suppresses neural firing of medial septal cells in urethane-anesthetized as well as in unanesthetized rats in a dose-related fashion. Concurrent with the suppression of firing rate, the rhythmic bursting pattern of activity of MSA neurons is disrupted by ethanol. The changes observed in the MSA could not be attributed to an indirect action of ethanol on afferents from the lateral septum to the MSA, because ethanol did not alter neural activity of cells in the lateral septum. These data indicate that ethanol does not have a common action on all neurons. Neural activity in the MSA recovered from the acute action of ethanol at a time when blood ethanol levels were near maximal, indicating an acute tolerance to this effect of ethanol. The time course of change in neural activity in the MSA was highly correlated with the time course of a measure of behavioral sedation, but not the hypothermia produced by ethanol. Thus, the work in this manuscript supports the view that ethanol has selective actions on MSA neurons in the rat septal area and that these actions may influence the behavioral sedation induced by ethanol.\r"

Both patients had a dramatic improvement in the hematuria immediately postoperatively and 1 with prolonged followup has no urological disability. We suggest that this procedure be considered for management of severe hemorrhagic cystitis as an alternative to more aggressive surgical therapies, such as formal urinary diversion with cystectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental bladder outlet obstruction in cats was produced by surgical placement of a silastic cuff around the urethra. Two sizes of cuff were used to produce either moderate or severe obstruction. The following is a summary of the short-term effects on bladder function. Obstruction induced a significant increase in the in vivo voiding pressure, in proportion to severity of the obstruction. There were no significant differences between control and obstructed cats in bladder mass, response of the isolated whole bladder to field stimulation or bethanechol, response of isolated bladder strips to field stimulation, bethanechol and ATP, or muscarinic receptor density in the bladder body. Although there were no differences in bladder mass between control and obstructed bladders, the hydroxyproline concentration of the severely obstructed bladders was significantly reduced. Creatine phosphate concentration was also significantly reduced in obstructed bladders. Although all whole cat bladder preparations displayed spontaneous contractile activity during in vitro cystometry, the obstructed bladders had a greater amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions with a lower volume threshold. In addition, the obstructed bladders had a greater tetrodotoxin-resistant contractile response to field stimulation. These results suggest that the obstructed cat bladder can compensate for increased outlet resistance without induction of bladder hypertrophy or significant functional changes, as seen in both rat and rabbit.\r"

  ".W": "Rats were subjected to infravesical outflow obstruction for six weeks. The bladder function was followed by cytometrical and in vitro investigations and by recordings of micturition pattern before and after removal of the obstruction. Cytometrical investigations showed that outflow obstruction for six weeks induced a bladder instability. Further, in the presence of obstruction the micturition pressure was large as was the bladder capacity and the rats had residual urine. After removal of the obstruction the bladder function rapidly normalized. The bladder instability disappeared within one week, bladder capacity decreased as did the micturition pressure. Moreover, only a minor amount of residual urine was present post-obstruction. In vitro investigation showed that the response to carbachol and to electrical stimulation was similar in normal and obstructed bladders. However, after removal of the obstruction a supersensitivity to carbachol as well as to electrical stimulation had developed. Obstructed bladders showed a markedly decreased response to substance P. The sensitivity to substance P was rapidly enhanced post-obstruction and after four days the response was restored to the control level. The present study shows that the bladder function in rats with infravesical outflow obstruction rapidly normalized after removal of the obstruction. The disappearance of the bladder instability despite the developed supersensitivity to muscarinic receptor stimulation supports the opinion that the bladder instability is not of muscarinic origin.\r"

I.V.) diabetic male rats underwent cystometrographic (CMG) and electrophysiologic evaluations under urethane anesthesia (1.2 gm./kg.) to determine whether the neural pathways to the urinary bladder are altered in these animals. Diabetic rats (n = 6) in comparison to controls (n = 8) had significantly greater micturition volumes (3.0 +/- 0.8 ml. vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4 ml., p less than 0.001), bladder compliances (0.51 +/- 0.15 cm. H2O/ml. vs. 0.12 +/- 0.09 cm. H2O/ml., p less than 0.001) and bladder weights (225.2 +/- 21.4 mg. vs. 112.2 +/- 18.0 mg., p less than 0.01). No differences were noted in: 1) the thresholds or conduction velocities of axons in the bladder postganglionic nerves, 2) transmission in the major ganglion or 3) the latencies for firing in the supraspinal parasympathetic reflex pathway to the bladder. However, the supraspinal reflex, which was facilitated by bladder distension in 38% of control rats, was not facilitated in any diabetic rats. Another apparent difference in diabetic rats was the absence of spinal reflex response which was noted in 38% of control animals. This study confirmed that CMG changes in STZ-induced diabetic rats are similar to those observed clinically in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy, and in addition raise the possibility that these changes are produced by a defect in autonomic reflexes. It is also clear that alterations of the micturition reflex pathway in diabetic rats are distinct from those associated with another type of enlarged, abnormal bladder induced by bladder outlet obstruction.\r"

  ".U": "90230345\r", 
  ".W": "Serotonin is a biogenic amine that can exert multiple effects on smooth muscle, including smooth muscle of the genitourinary tract; effects that may be species dependent. The present study using isolated tissues documents potent contractile responses to serotonin in canine bladder smooth muscle. Contractile responses to serotonin in canine bladder could be mimicked by alpha-methyl serotonin, a selective 5HT2 receptor agonist. In fact, although alpha-methyl serotonin was slightly less potent as a contractile agonist relative to serotonin, the contractile response to alpha-methyl serotonin was more persistent as evidenced by a greater recovery time to resting force following washout. In contrast, the 5HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT and the 5HT3 selective agonist, 2-methyl serotonin, did not markedly contract canine bladder. These data establish that contractile responses to serotonin in the canine bladder are mediated by activation of 5HT2 receptors. We further demonstrated that the 5HT2 receptor antagonist, LY53857, potently inhibited the contractile response to both serotonin and alpha-methyl serotonin in the canine bladder consistent with agonist activation of 5HT2 receptors. In contrast to the potent response to serotonin observed in the canine bladder, rat bladder preparations did not markedly contract in response to serotonin, alpha-methyl serotonin, 8-OH-DPAT, or 2-methyl serotonin. Thus, these studies reinforce the marked species variability in responsiveness to serotonin and indicate that contraction to serotonin in the canine bladder is mediated by activation of the 5HT2 receptor.\r"

Fresh human surgical explants incorporated radiolabeled DNA precursors [H3)thymidine or deoxyuridine) in 97% of 38 patient specimens (18/19 bladder, 3/3 prostate, 2/2 testis, 13/14 renal), after being maintained for three to 13 weeks/passage, with several specimens reaching their sixth passage (20 months). Control cellular DNA incorporation ranged from five to 90% (#cells labeled/#cells evaluated), with median labeling for bladder 30%, prostate 80%, testis 90%, and renal 80%. Original histopathologic classification was maintained in all cases. Tumor volume and glucose consumption were other measurable parameters. Seventy-three surgical specimen cultures were treated with chemotherapeutic agents after a minimum of four weeks in culture. Single agent exposures were 24 hours at 1X and 10X reported peak plasma concentrations. Combination agents were sequenced as in current clinical protocol for bladder tumors and fourteen day continuous fluorodeoxyuridine (FdURD) exposure for renal tumors. Sensitivity was found in 1/2 prostate and 1/10 renal tumors to Adriamycin, 8/15 bladder and 1/2 testis tumors to cisplatin, 11/28 renal tumors to FdURD and 6/16 bladder tumors to MVAC combination chemotherapy. This culture system offers the advantages of in vivo-like solid tumor growth, a high culture success rate, longevity in culture, maintenance of the primary histopathology and reproducible chemosensitivity response.\r"

Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to varying lengths of bilateral testicular ischemia. Group I underwent normothermic ischemia for two, four, and six hours. Likewise, Group II underwent similar time periods of ischemia, however, after thirty minutes of normothermic ischemia the scrotum of each animal was placed into an ice bath maintained at 4C. Two weeks postoperatively, bilateral orchiectomy was performed. Histology of the testes of the two groups was compared. Neither group revealed significant destruction of the germinal epithelium after two hours of ischemia. Group I revealed only 25% preservation of the germinal epithelium at four hours and only 8% preservation at six hours of ischemia. In contrast, Group II which received ice showed 90% preservation of germinal epithelium at four hours and 85% preservation at six hours of ischemia. We conclude that external ice application significantly preserves seminiferous tubules at four and six hours of ischemic injury in the rat testicle.\r"

We examined the effects on survival of this cell line caused by verapamil, which has been shown to reverse multi-drug resistance in vitro in other neoplastic cell lines. Both MGH-U1R and MGH-U1, the non-resistant parent cell line, were treated with varying concentrations of doxorubicin alone, verapamil alone, or both drugs simultaneously, all for one hour. Cells were then grown in drug-free medium for 10 days, stained, and counted. Standard survival curves were calculated. Verapamil alone had no significant cytotoxicity. Verapamil at concentrations of 16 micrograms./ml. and 32 micrograms./ml. decreased the IC50 of doxorubicin for MGH-U1R by a factor of 2.5. Using H3-verapamil, we also examined the systemic and local absorption of this drug resulting from intravesical verapamil administration in rabbits. All animals were treated for one hour, and multiple serum samples were drawn during treatment. Verapamil was found in high concentrations in the mucosa, less in the adventitia, and was absent in venous blood. Verapamil effectively reverses resistance to doxorubicin of MGH-U1R in vitro. The intravesical use of verapamil appears to be safe, and may prove to be a useful adjunct in the intravesical therapy of some bladder tumors.\r"
