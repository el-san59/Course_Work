  ".W": "The rat ovary receives sympathetic innervation from the superior ovarian nerve (SON) and the plexus nerve (OP). To examine the possibility of a direct adrenergic mechanism controlling ovarian receptor distribution during the onset of puberty, we have studied the acute (48-h) effect of unilateral nervotomy (combined section of SON and OP nerves) on ovarian LHRH and beta-adrenergic receptor concentrations and distribution using both radioreceptor assays and in vitro autoradiography. Ovarian LHRH receptor concentration increased sharply between 12 and 20 days of age. At this time receptors were mostly associated with follicles and interstitial cells, whereas at 37 days of age, when a measurable loss in the receptor concentration was observed, light and diffuse autoradiographic labeling of receptors was also found in the corpora lutea. Complete removal of adrenergic input to the gland produced a sharp decrease in LHRH-binding activity within the denervated ovary at each time interval studied, with no effect in the innervated contralateral gland. Autoradiographic data also revealed a decrease in both the number of labeled follicles and the intensity of the labeling. beta-Adrenergic receptor concentration increased progressively between days 12 and 27, reaching a peak value at 37 days of age. Labeling was very weak at 12 days of age and increased progressively at 20 and 27 days of age. At this time, receptors were mostly localized by autoradiography in the interstitial cells, while at 37 days of age corpora lutea were strongly labeled. Ovarian beta-adrenergic receptors showed a marked drop when acutely deprived of their neural tone, as illustrated by the 2- to 3-fold decrease in receptor-binding capacity within the denervated gland. The autoradiographic data also showed marked changes in beta-adrenergic receptor distribution, specially at 37 days of age. At this time, the labeling of corpora lutea was markedly decreased in denervated ovaries. The present results clearly demonstrate that complete removal of ovarian adrenergic tone produces a profound decrease in the concentrations of LHRH and beta-adrenergic receptors within the ovary, although it cannot be excluded that peptidergic factors also arriving via the SON and OP could have some influence on the regulation of these receptors. The results support the concept of a direct involvement of the central nervous system in ovarian function. They also suggest that during ovarian development a neural efferent system might be involved in the adjustment of ovarian responsiveness to stimulation by the gonadotropins via changes in receptor content and/or distribution in the different ovarian compartments.\r"

Congestive heart failure in the hamster produced a significant increase in plasma IR-ANF, a significant decrease in atrial IR-ANF, and a marked increase in ventricular IR-ANF. The HPLC pattern of IR-ANF was of the high mol wt type in atria and ventricles of control and cardiomyopathic animals. High mol wt forms of ANF appeared in the plasma of animals with severe congestive heart failure, but not in controls. Severe congestive heart failure produced a tremendous increase in the size of the Golgi complex, with a decrease in the number and size of secretory granules in atrial cardiocytes. Ventricular cardiocytes also showed a less marked increase in the size of the Golgi complex. Secretory-like granules indistinguishable from lysosomes were present in about 1% of ventricular cardiocytes of control hamsters; in hamsters with severe congestive heart failure, secretory granules, identical to those of atrial cardiocytes, were present in greater number in about 20% of ventricular cardiocytes. Immunocytochemistry (immunogold technique) revealed that secretory granules containing IR-ANF are not present in control ventricular cardiocytes but are localized in relatively large number in about 20% of ventricular cardiocytes in hamsters with severe congestive heart failure. These results suggest that the increased IR-ANF levels (including the high mol wt forms) in animals with congestive heart failure may come from hypersecretion of both atrial and ventricular cardiocytes.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, the role of dopamine and TRH in suckling-induced PRL release was investigated. Bupropion, a dopamine reuptake blocker, increased hypophysial stalk dopamine levels and inhibited suckling-induced PRL release. A short period of suckling, thought to induce a transient decrease in hypothalamic dopamine release, led to higher PRL levels following an iv injection of TRH than in rats which had not nursed their young for a short period after 4- to 6-h separation. These results, in combination with previous data, suggest that a decrease in hypothalamic dopamine release is important for suckling-induced PRL release. Increased PRL release may be in part due to an augmented hypothalamic release of TRH. Since serotonergic mechanisms seem involved in TRH release, lactating rats were treated with drugs acting on serotonergic pathways. Parachlorophenylalanine and pizotifen did not alter suckling-induced PRL release. Methysergide, a serotonin receptor blocker, prevented this PRL release when administered ip but not when injected into the lateral brain ventricle. Since methysergide is converted peripherally into metabolite(s) with dopamine agonistic activity, its effect on suckling-induced PRL release may be due to this action, rather than to its action on serotonin receptors. Thus, these data do not indicate that serotonergic mechanisms are important for suckling-induced PRL release. Passive immunization against TRH inhibited suckling-induced PRL release, indicating that TRH is a hypophysiotropic mediator of this PRL release.\r"

The effects of electrical stimulation of the hypothalamic periventricular nucleus (PE) on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-induced PRL and TRH-stimulated TSH secretion were studied using pentobarbital-anesthetized male rats bearing indwelling cannulae in the right atria. The animals were implanted in the PE with bipolar concentric stimulating electrodes 1 week before the experiments began. The effects of a bolus injection or a continuous infusion of SRIF-14 (iv, 7.6 or 10 nmol/100 g BW, respectively) on the PRL or TSH release induced by VIP or TRH were also examined. Electrical stimulation of the PE significantly enhanced VIP-induced PRL release 19 min after the bolus injection of VIP (from 29.3 +/- 7.2 to 59.7 +/- 14.9 ng/ml, P less than 0.05). A bolus injection of SRIF had a similar effect and increased the PRL response to VIP (from 29.3 +/- 7.2 to 114.7 +/- 22.4 ng/ml, P less than 0.01). Continuous infusion of SRIF did not decrease the stimulatory effect of VIP on PRL release; on the contrary it significantly increased the PRL response to a first VIP injection (10 min after the onset of SRIF-14 infusion) over that observed after a second administration of VIP. Neither electrical stimulation of the PE nor the bolus SRIF-14 injection modified basal PRL secretion. Electrical stimulation of the PE slightly but significantly increased the TSH response to a bolus injection of TRH, but had no effect on the basal TSH release. In contrast, both the bolus injection and the continuous infusion of SRIF-14 significantly and persistently inhibited the TRH-stimulated TSH release. These results suggest that 1) SRIF does not inhibit VIP-induced PRL secretion in vivo but rather enhances it through some unknown mechanism; 2) SRIF inhibits TRH-stimulated TSH secretion.\r"

All regions of the central nervous system previously recognized to contain TRH showed hybridization. Hypophysiotropic neurons in the medial parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus showed more intense hybridization than anterior parvocellular division cells, suggesting regional differences in expression. In addition, regions not previously recognized to contain TRH in neuronal perikarya by immunocytochemistry showed specific hybridization for pro-TRH mRNA. These include cells in the olfactory bulbs, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and anterior commissural nucleus. Only a single hybridizing band was observed on Northern blots of RNA extracts of the periaqueductal gray and reticular nucleus, identical to that seen in extracts of the paraventricular nucleus. The appearance of pro-TRH mRNA in neurons not previously recognized to contain TRH but which contain the prohormone suggests that non-TRH peptides within the TRH precursor may be preferentially expressed in certain regions of the brain.\r"

In common with other TGases thus far identified, testicular TGase is calcium dependent. A concentration-dependent relationship was observed between decreasing TGase activity and increasing concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide and bacitracin, inhibitors of TGase, and the TGase substrate monodansylcadaverine. Although NEM at all concentrations tested had no effect on [125I]human (h) FSH-receptor binding, dissociation of [125I]hFSH from its receptor was enhanced when [125I]hFSH-receptor complexes were formed in the presence of NEM. Dissociation of [125I]hFSH from its receptor also increased in the presence of bacitracin or monodansylcadaverine. Reduced TGase activity always paralleled increases in hormone-receptor dissociation. The inverse relationship between TGase activity and [125I]hFSH-receptor dissociation observed in this study suggests that TGase activity may be involved in the interaction of FSH with its receptor and that protein cross-linking (via peptide bond formation) may be a mechanism whereby some FSH-receptor complexes are stabilized in the bovine testis.\r"

  ".U": "87246413\r", 
  ".W": "Free radicals have been implicated in many pathological processes, including ischemia, inflammation, and malignancy. Since a reduction in extrathyroidal outer ring monodeiodination of T4 and rT3 occurs in virtually all systemic illnesses, we have studied the effect of free radicals on iodothyronine (T4 and rT3) 5'-monodeiodinating activity (MA) of liver tissue in vitro. Rat liver microsomes or homogenate were preincubated in Tris buffer for 30 min with a free radical-generating system (FRGS) and then incubated with T4 (2.5 microM) or [125I]rT3 (0.4 nM) and dithiothreitol (DTT; 5-20 mM with T4 and 20-150 mM with [125I]rT3) in the same buffer for 10 or 30 min. T3 generated during incubation was quantified by RIA of ethanol extracts of the incubation mixture. 125I generated from [125I]rT3 was quantified after precipitation of the incubation mixture with trichloroacetic acid or by paper chromatography. Free radicals caused 55% or more reduction in hepatic T4 MA and 44% or more reduction in rT3 MA in various experiments. The inhibition of hepatic rT3 MA after incubation with FRGS persisted despite removal of FRGS and washing of microsomes preincubated with FRGS before studying the MA. However, inclusion of DTT (1-60 mM) during preincubation of tissue with FRGS prevented the FRGS-induced inhibition of rT3 MA. Depletion of the iodothyronine substrate did not occur when FRGS inhibited T4 and rT3 5'-monodeiodination. Free radical scavengers, i.e. superoxide dismutase (600 IU/ml), catalase (300 U/ml), tocopherol (10 mg/ml), thiourea (0.15 M), and tert-butanol (0.15 M), all significantly reduced the inhibition of hepatic rT3 MA caused by FRGS. The FRGS-induced inhibition of hepatic T4 MA was reduced by the same doses of tocopherol, thiourea, and tert-butanol, but not by superoxide dismutase or catalase. Since free radicals may effect tissue damage by lipid peroxidation and since the latter results in generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) as a by-product of the reaction, we studied MDA by its reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid. Incubation with FRGS caused an approximately 100-fold increase in MDA formation in liver microsomes. Serum MDA was significantly higher in 16 NTI patients than in 8 normal subjects and also higher in turpentine oil-injected rats [an experimental model of nonthyroidal illness (NTI)] than in saline-injected control rats. The data suggest that generation of free radicals may contribute to the reduced extrathyroidal 5'-monodeiodination of T4 and rT3 in NTI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies were directed at the question of whether polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB; Aroclor 1254) and polybrominated biphenyl (PBB; Fire Master BP-6), when administered in the diets of female Sprague-Dawley rats over long periods of time (5-7 months) and at low dosages (0, 1, 5, 10, and 50 ppm), would depress the thyroid. By examining serum T3 and T4, kinetics of T4 metabolism, and in vivo thyroid response to exogenous TSH injections, an estimate of the degree of hypothyroidism was made, and abnormalities in T4 disappearance from serum were encountered. Serum T3 and T4 levels were greatly suppressed in a dose-related manner by PCB or PBB treatment. There was a diminished response of serum T3 and T4 to TSH injection in rats pretreated with PCB or PBB (5 and 10 ppm), the exception being T3 in the 5 ppm PCB treatment group. Had the PCB and PBB treatment-induced suppression of T4 and T3 been on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, the response of the treated rats to exogenous TSH might have exceeded that of controls; however, the opposite occurred. Disappearance of injected doses of L-[125I]T4 diminished as treatment concentrations of PCB or PBB increased. Disappearance slopes (r = 0.98) and fractional turnover rate constants (k) were decreased (t1/2 was lengthened) at each treatment level compared to the control values. The T4 distribution space (per 100 g BW) was expanded with increasing dosage by as much as 8-fold in the 50 pmm PCB treatment group. T4 MCRs were not increased by PCB or PBB treatment; thus, decreases in serum T3 and T4 were not caused by increased catabolism. T4 production rates were decreased at all treatment levels, but maximally 6-fold by 50 ppm PCB treatment. Together these data indicate that PCB-PBB-induced decreases in serum T3 and T4 result primarily from direct damage to the thyroid rather than any enhanced hepatic or other peripheral catabolism per se. Expanded T4 distribution space demonstrated that nonthyroid damage was also an important factor in reducing serum T4. Cell membrane damage associated with PCB-PBB intoxication may have expanded pools for T4 dilution. The findings are consistent with reported histological and ultrastructural damage caused by PCB and PBB. It also appears that TSH plays little role in PCB-PBB-induced hypothyroidism.\r"

Cultures were treated for 2 days with steroids and then challenged with LHRH for 4 h. B inhibited LH secretion, increasing the EC50 for LHRH from 1.40 to 4.96 nM. The reduction in LH release was accompanied by an increase in cell LH, so that the total amount of LH present in the cultures was unchanged. The EC50 for the effect of B on LH secretion was 0.57 microM. B increased the total amount of FSH present in the cultures. At high concentrations of B (10-100 microM), this effect was associated with an increase in FSH secretion. Testosterone inhibited LH secretion in both the absence and the presence of B. B had no effect in the presence of maximal concentrations of testosterone but augmented the inhibitory effect of lower concentrations. Estradiol (E) stimulated LH secretion in both the absence and the presence of B. However, the stimulatory effect of E was reduced by B, so that cultures treated with both B and E secreted no more LH than untreated cultures. B inhibited the LH secretory responses to Ca2+ influx and protein kinase C activation but did not affect the response to arachidonic acid, suggesting that the mechanism of B action may involve an inhibition of arachidonic acid release. Together these results indicate that the inhibitory effects of stress on reproduction are mediated at least partially by the inhibitory effects of B on LH secretion.\r"

To investigate whether a more prolonged suppression of LH release during the early luteal phase could result in a sustained suppression of progesterone, 10 monkeys were treated with 3 consecutive daily injections of 300 micrograms LHRH antagonist/kg beginning on days 0 (n = 2), 1 (n = 1), 2 (n = 1), 3 (n = 2), 4 (n = 2), and 5 (n = 2) after the LH surge. When the antagonist was administered on the day of the LH surge, serum concentrations of bioactive LH were still elevated on the following day, but then fell to low levels. Serum progesterone concentrations were subnormal in these monkeys for the next 10 days, but recovered toward the late luteal phase. In the 8 monkeys receiving antagonist starting between days 1-5 after the LH surge, serum concentrations of bioactive LH were suppressed to near the detection limit of the assay for 4 days after the first injection. Seven of the 8 monkeys demonstrated a progressive decline in serum progesterone concentrations to undetectable values which remained for the duration of the luteal phase. In the remaining monkey the decline in progesterone was less marked; this animal presented a normal progesterone profile 3 days after the last antagonist injection. Premature menses occurred in all 8 monkeys; the next ovulation occurred 18.9 +/- 0.3 days after the last antagonist injection. To test luteal function after antagonist treatment during the early luteal phase and to mimic the rescue of the corpus luteum during a fertile cycle and assess the contraceptive effects of antagonist, hCG in daily doses of 30, 60, 90, 180, and 360 IU was administered starting on day 7 of the luteal phase to monkeys previously treated with three daily injections of 300 micrograms antagonist/kg during the early luteal phase. Control monkeys received hCG injections alone. In the controls, hCG administration elevated serum progesterone concentrations to 15-20 ng/ml. In three monkeys in which antagonist administration did not commence until day 5 or 6, hCG overcame the suppressive effect of the antagonist. However, in seven monkeys in which antagonist administration began on days 1-4, hCG caused only a small progesterone rise (maximal range, 1.8-4.9 ng/ml), about 20% of that observed in control monkeys receiving hCG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes a nuclear binding assay (NB assay) which measures not only the presence of a steroid receptor in a tissue, but also the quantity of that receptor which is biologically active or functional, i.e. able to bind to nuclear acceptor sites. The assay involves the isolation viable cells from tissues and their incubation with an excess of radiolabeled steroid to encourage the activation and nuclear binding of all cellular receptors. The nuclei are isolated under conditions that remove unactivated (unbound) steroid-receptor complexes. This NB assay demonstrates, in both animal and human steroid target tissues, a saturable, tissue- and steroid-specific, and temperature- and time-dependent nuclear binding of radiolabeled steroids. These properties support a receptor-dependent nuclear binding of steroids. This assay is reproducible and requires relatively small amounts of tissue. The patterns of nuclear binding of the progesterone receptor, achieved with the assay in the avian oviduct model system, are shown to correlate with the nuclear binding of progesterone in vivo, the ability of the steroid to alter transcription, and the expression of a specific gene product, the protein avidin. The assay has been used to identify the existence of nonfunctional steroid receptors in endometrial and breast carcinomas. Therefore, this NB assay combined with the standard charcoal/hydroxylapatite methods of quantitating total cellular receptors should provide a means of assessing changes in the regulation of the biological activity of steroid receptors. Further, the assay should be useful to assess the ability of steroid analogs to properly activate their respective receptors for subsequent nuclear binding.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were undertaken to determine if the content of prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase (PGS) was regulated in rat ovarian follicles in a time-, tissue-, and dose-dependent manner. For quantitation and localization of the enzyme by immunoblot and immunofluorescent analyses, respectively, a polyclonal antibody to highly purified (95%) ovine seminal vesicle PGS [mol wt, (Mr), 72,000] was generated in a rabbit, and an immunoglobulin G fraction of the antiserum was purified by elution from a PGS affinity resin. Soluble cell extracts were prepared from: 1) small antral (SA) and preovulatory (PO) rat follicles before and at selected time intervals after exposure to increasing doses (0.25-10.0 IU) of hCG, 2) granulosa and thecal cells of these same follicles, and 3) granulosa cells of hypophysectomized (H) rats before and after treatment with estradiol (HE), estradiol and FSH (HEF), and 10 IU hCG. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that the content of PGS (Mr, 72,000) was low (negligible) in granulosa and thecal cells of SA and PO follicles, was induced preferentially (approximately 15-fold) in granulosa cells between 1 and 7 h after hCG treatment (0.5, 2.0, or 10 IU), and declined between 12-24 h after administration of 10 IU hCG, reaching undetectable amounts in corpora lutea isolated 48 h after hCG treatment. PGS (Mr, 72,000) was also induced by 10 IU hCG in granulosa cells of HEF rats, but was low in granulosa cells of H, HE, and HEF rats. In contrast, prostacyclin synthase was present in granulosa cells of preantral (H and HE rats), SA, and PO follicles, was not induced by hCG, and was highest in thecal cells. Immunofluorescent analyses confirmed both the tissue-specific localization and induction of PGS in granulosa cells of rat PO follicles treated with 10 IU hCG and the subcellular fractionation analyses showing that the PGS that was induced by hCG was localized primarily to a membrane (plasma membrane?) fraction of granulosa cells. Immunofluorescent data also demonstrated immunoreactive PGS in the vascular tissue of the rat corpus luteum but not in the luteal cells. Results of these studies document unequivocally that the synthesis of prostaglandins that is increased by LH/hCG in rats preceding ovulation is associated with an increased PGS content, that induction of the induced enzyme is transient, and that the enzyme is primarily localized to granulosa cell membrane fractions.\r"

T3 produced a dose-dependent increase in the specific activity of pyroglutamyl peptidase I after 3 days of exposure. The EC50 for T3 was 5 X 10(-10) M. The specific activity of prolyl endopeptidase was unaffected by exposure to T3. The increase in pyroglutamyl peptidase I activity was dependent upon the time of exposure of the cells to this hormone. A maximal effect occurred at 72 h. The stimulation of pyroglutamyl peptidase I by T3 was totally blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that this enzyme is induced in GH3 cells by T3. The effect of T3 on the two TRH-degrading enzymes was also studied in the ACTH-secreting cell line AtT20. T3 had no effect on these enzymes in the AtT20 cell, suggesting that the effect of T3 on pyroglutamyl peptidase I may be cell specific. These studies indicate that the induction of pyroglutamyl peptidase I by T3 may contribute to the negative feedback regulation of T3 levels.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma membrane samples prepared from corpora lutea (CL) of control and prostaglandin F2 alpha-treated rats were incubated with radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine for 90 min at 40 C with 1 mM CaCl2 to test for the presence of phospholipase A2 activity. At the end of the incubation period, labeled arachidonic acid cleaved from the 2 position of the phospholipid moiety had accumulated to 10.7 +/- 2.4% (mean +/- SE) of the initially added radioactivity in the prostaglandin F2 alpha-treated samples, with 3.7 +/- 1.2% appearing in the controls. Arachidonic acid production was inhibited by calcium chelation and by the phospholipase A2 inhibitor bromophenacyl bromide, indicating heightened activity of phospholipase A2 in CL plasma membranes undergoing regression. Unexpectedly, radiolabeled lysophosphatidylcholine was produced in regressed membrane samples at a similar rate, suggesting the induction of phospholipase A1 activity as well. To determine if the membrane rigidification that occurs with regressed membrane samples under the same incubation conditions is caused by the hydrolysis products of phospholipase activity, fluorescence polarization experiments with the probe trans-parinaric acid were conducted. Washing of incubated membrane samples with fatty acid-free BSA, which selectively removes free fatty acids and lysophosphatides from the bilayer, resulted in a restoration of the fluidity to levels recorded at the onset of the incubation. These results suggest that the previously described decreases in CL plasma membrane fluidity and hCG binding in vitro during luteolysis are caused by a synergistic effect of calcium ion and hydrolysis products of phospholipase A activity.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical and spectrophotometric studies of second messenger pathways transducing TRH signals in clonal pituitary (GH) cells have shown that TRH induces rapid turnover of phosphoinositides and changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ as well as activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and secretion of PRL. Here we have used classical microelectrode and contemporary patch pipette recording techniques under current-clamp conditions to compare the effects of TRH receptor-coupled stimulation with direct activation of PKC on the excitability of GH3/B6 cells. With high resistance microelectrodes TRH induced a complex sequence of changes in membrane properties consisting of an initial 20- to 30-mV hyperpolarization associated with an increase in membrane conductance lasting less than a minute, followed by several minutes of low amplitude fluctuations and action potential activity superimposed on a modest increase in input resistance. Active phorbol ester induced a slowly developing hyperpolarization of about 5 mV and a modest increase in input resistance, followed by several minutes of low amplitude fluctuations and spontaneous action potential activity. Both the peptide- and phorbol ester-evoked changes in excitability were attenuated or completely lost during patch recordings in the whole cell mode. Dilute aqueous lysates of the clone restored various phases of the electrical response. The low amplitude fluctuations and action potential activity phase could be induced by either TRH or phorbol ester if the cells were dialyzed with intracellular electrolyte containing PKC and at least 50 nM Ca2+. These results demonstrate that the phosphoinositide/PKC circuit activated by TRH in clonal pituitary cells has electrically detectable effects on cell excitability, and these help to explain TRH's actions on electrical activity.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were undertaken to evaluate the effects of cysteamine (CSH), cystamine (CS-S), N-acetyl-cysteine, D-penicillamine, and a major metabolite of CSh, taurine, on plasma PRL levels in normal and estrogen-primed hyperprolactinemic rats. Both CSH and CS-S caused a marked decrease in plasma PRL concentration in hyperprolactinemic rats. The effects of CSH and CS-S lasted for at least 6 h but returned toward pretreatment levels 24 h later. In normal rats a fall in basal plasma PRL concentration was not readily observed but after stimulation with TRH or metaclopramide, PRL secretion elicited by these stimuli was markedly inhibited by CSH and CS-S. The response to TRH or MCP 24 h after treatment with CSH was variable with CS-S appearing to cause an unexpected increase in PRL release in response to TRH or metaclopramide. The structurally related compounds, taurine, N-acetyl-cysteine, and D-penicillamine did not cause any reduction of plasma PRL levels in hyperprolactinemic rats. This may be due, in the case of taurine, to a loss of the free sulfydryl group, in the case of N-acetyl-cysteine, a change in basicity because of a carboxyl group and derivatization of the amino group and D-penicillamine, again a change in basicity due to a free carboxyl group as well as an altered structural relationship between the free amino and sulfydryl groups. These studies indicate that CSH and CS-S by possible reduction to CSH cause a reversible depletion in plasma PRL in normal and hyperprolactinemic rats. Because both substances inhibit different receptor-mediated stimuli, their mechanism of action is likely to be mediated at a common locus involved with the synthesis and release of PRL.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of two types of steroidal contraception on the extent of coronary, aortic, carotid, and iliaco-femoral atherosclerosis was assessed in 57 cynomolgus macaques with moderate diet-induced hyperlipoproteinemia. Thirteen animals were treated with an intravaginal ring that released 17 beta-estradiol and levonorgestrel. Fifteen females were treated with an oral contraceptive (OC) composed of ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel. Fifteen females received placebo vaginal rings, and 14 males were untreated. The contraceptive treatments resulted in similar large reductions in plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. Neither treatment influenced the prevalence of coronary artery atherosclerosis. However, treatment with the contraceptive vaginal ring was associated with increased extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis (plaque size) relative to untreated females, whereas treatment with the OC was not. The contrasting effects of the two treatments could not be explained by differences in total plasma cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or blood pressure. The results suggest that the greater estrogenic influence associated with the ethinyl estradiol-containing OC resulted in inhibition of coronary artery atherosclerosis despite a pronounced progestin-induced lowering of plasma HDL cholesterol concentration and, further, that hormonal balance may have a marked influence on the relationship between plasma lipids and atherogenesis.\r"

The data indicate (1) whereas most ovulations occurred on or before day 3 after hCG treatment, when the \"step-up\" dose regimen was employed additional follicles had ruptured on days 4 and 5; (2) a \"step-down\" protocol for hMG therapy may better synchronize follicular rupture and reduce susceptibility to delayed ovulations compared with a \"step-up\" dose regimen; and (3) under hMG stimulation, few follicles would rupture spontaneously (without hCG or luteinizing hormone treatment).\r"

There were no significant differences in arterial pH and [HCO3-] between CO2 and air treatment groups, whereas arterial pCO2 and pO2 were significantly increased in the CO2 treatment group. We found that the duration of pneumoperitoneum, irrespective of type of gas used, was negatively correlated with success of embryonic development. These findings necessitate that more attention be given to the gas used for creation of a pneumoperitoneum during egg retrieval for in vitro fertilization and an attempt be made to minimize duration of the pneumoperitoneum.\r"

On the 28th day or 15 to 20 days after menstruation for subsequent cycles, during maintenance of D-Trp-6-LH-RH therapy, a usual gonadotropin regimen was carried out in 33 cycles. Human menopausal gonadotropins obtained follicular maturation in all cycles. However, there was never the growth of a single dominant follicle but always of several follicles. Human chorionic gonadotropin then induced ovulation in 31 cycles (94%). Luteal phase was normal in 28 and inadequate in 3 of the 31 ovulatory cycles. Hyperstimulation, generally mild to moderate but rather severe in 2 cycles, was constant. Five pregnancies were obtained. The overall pregnancy rate was 15% per cycle and 17.8% per normoovulatory cycle. This study showed that an associated treatment with an LH-RH analog enables gonadotropins to achieve ovulation regularly with an encouraging number of pregnancies but at a risk of hyperstimulation.\r"

Two groups of 52 patients were randomly selected to commence ovarian stimulation on either day 2 or day 4. The mean +/- standard deviation day of the LH surge was 11.0 +/- 0.9 for day 2 and 12.2 +/- 0.9 for day 4 (P less than 0.001), and the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration was 10.7 +/- 1.2 for day 2 and 11.4 +/- 0.9 for day 4 (P less than 0.02). The two groups also differed significantly in the mean number of days of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) administration (day 2, 7.4 +/- 2.7, versus day 4, 6.3 +/- 2.5), and the mean number of vials of hMG administered (day 2, 10.4 +/- 3.2, versus day 4, 8.1 +/- 2.9). However, the mean estradiol level on the day of the LH surge or hCG administration, the number of oocytes collected and fertilized, the number of embryos transferred, and the pregnancy rates were not significantly different. In conclusion, the day of the LH surge or hCG administration can be influenced by the day of initiation of ovarian stimulation, and the initiation of ovarian stimulation around day 4 of the menstrual cycle is clinically more efficient than initiation of follicular development early in the follicular phase.\r"

Early follicular phase responses showed four patterns: type 1 consisted of a delayed follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) peak and was seen with severe hypothalamic suppression (n = 4); type 2 consisted of a brisk and dominant FSH peak on the first day of treatment, and occurred with mild to moderate hypothalamic suppression (n = 19); type 3, which consisted of an FSH peak accompanied by an immediate and exaggerated luteinizing hormone (LH) rise, occurred with mild PCOS and some cases of HCA (n = 5); and type 4, in which LH levels were high to begin with and neither FSH nor LH levels rose with GnRH, occurred with severe PCOS (n = 2). Exaggerated estradiol responses within 24 hours of therapy were seen in eight cycles: in four cases no ovarian abnormality was apparent; in three cases a dominant follicle was already present; and in one case ovarian hyperstimulation was diagnosed ultrasonographically. With standard human chorionic gonadotropin luteal phase support, luteal phase defects were rare with HCA but common with PCOS.\r"

A 55% reduction (range, 38% to 84%) in uterine volume assessed by ultrasound was obtained. The greatest reduction (30%) was apparent within the first treatment cycle regardless of whether treatment was started in the early follicular or the luteal phase. Fibroid regression was inversely correlated with urinary estrogen concentration. Treatment was well tolerated and only one subject withdrew from the study before its scheduled completion. Following cessation of therapy, ovulatory menstruation returned within 3 months in the majority of the subjects, but this was accompanied by a rapid regrowth of the fibroids. This medical approach to the management of fibroids merits further investigation but as yet cannot be regarded as an alternative to surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone were measured throughout the luteal phase in 21 anovulatory patients who developed ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) during menotropin induction of ovulation. The pattern of PRA in hyperstimulated cycles is characterized by a midluteal peak, which declines to normal in the late luteal phase in nonconceptual cycles, whereas a sustained elevation of PRA occurs in conceptual cycles. Midluteal PRA is significantly (P less than 0.001) elevated in patients with OHSS compared with controls. In the mild form of the disease, the median of PRA is 7.5 (range 6 to 11) ng angiotensin I (AI)/ml/hr, significantly higher than the median for controls, 3.0 ng AI/ml/hr (range, 1.4 to 5). In moderate OHSS, PRA was 24.5 (range, 10 to 40) ng AI/ml/hr, whereas, in the severe form of OHSS, PRA was 55.0 (range, 29 to 95) ng AI/ml/hr. A significant correlation (P less than 0.05) was demonstrated between PRA and either progesterone or 17 beta estradiol (E2). The renin-angiotensin cascade is implicated in new vessel formation. Angiogenesis itself is associated with a rapid increase in capillary permeability. The recent demonstration of high plasma renin-like activity in human follicular fluid and the present observation of high PRA in patients with OHSS may imply that the locally active renin angiotensin system, through induction of new vessel formation and increase in capillary permeability, may have a casual relationship to the ovarian enlargement and extracellular fluid accumulation that are the hallmarks of OHSS.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-five adolescents with menstrual irregularities persisting since menarche were studied and the data analyzed in relation to gynecologic age. In each year, in the premenstrual phase, luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), and androstenedione (delta 4A) values were higher than those of adults. Estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), progesterone (P), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEAS) gradually increased up to adult values correlating with gynecologic age. By ultrasound, nearly half the ovaries were multicystic and ovarian volume was greater than that of adults in each gynecologic year. When the data were classified as ovulatory or anovulatory, ovulation appeared to be a dynamic process characterized by ovaries similar to those of adults and by increasing hormonal levels correlated to gynecologic age. By contrast, in anovulatory cycles, mean T, delta 4A, and LH values were stable in each year and constantly higher than in ovulatory cycles and adult controls. These findings suggest that, despite persistent irregular cycles, some adolescents normalize all endocrine and ovarian parameters toward maturity, while subjects with persistent irregular anovulatory cycles maintain marked hyperandrogenism, increasingly high LH values, and enlarged multicystic ovaries.\r"

An increase in clinical implantation was noted with a reduction of transfer volume and proportion of air, with 34% of laparoscopies being followed by clinical pregnancy over the last 18 months. No difference in the rate of clinical pregnancy was noted relative to uterine depth or position. The high rate of multiple implantation (47%) suggested a high level of embryo quality. The success rate was attributed to a strong ovarian, human menopausal gonadotropin stimulation, accurate timing of human chorionic gonadotropin, a high oocyte retrieval rate, meticulous laboratory technique, atraumatic, high-fundal transfer of embryos, and initiation of embryo cryopreservation.\r"

  ".W": "A major problem in standardization of the islet cell cytoplasmic antibody (ICA) assay is variation in sensitivity of the different human pancreas substrates used in individual laboratories. To circumvent this problem, we have developed an assay that utilizes Wistar-Furth rat pancreas as substrate, an anti-islet monoclonal antibody (A2B5) to identify islets and fluorescein-conjugated protein A to identify patient autoantibodies. Sera from 85 control subjects, 27 type I diabetics, and 17 subjects at high risk for developing type I diabetes were assayed in parallel with our standard ICA assay on human pancreas substrate and with Wistar-Furth rat pancreas as substrate. Two sera from control subjects (2 of 85) were ICA positive with rat pancreas compared to 1 of 85 with human pancreas substrate. Sera from 11 of 27 type I diabetics and 15 of 17 sera from high-risk subjects were ICA positive with either rat or human pancreas substrate. A correlation between the specific islet fluorescence readings on human and rat pancreas sections was found with sera from high-risk and control subjects. Furthermore, end-point titers of an ICA-positive serum were identical with both assays. Finally, incubation of an ICA-positive serum with glycolipids, extracted from either human or Wistar-Furth rat pancreas, blocked subsequent ICA binding. These findings suggest that Wistar-Furth rat pancreas expresses an identical or similar autoantigen to human pancreas.\r"

The strategy of air contrast barium enema alone had the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio. Rigid sigmoidoscopy combined with barium enema had a lower cost-effectiveness ratio than primary colonoscopy, but the strategy of primary colonoscopy could have an equal or better ratio depending on assumptions about test costs and the benefit of removing benign polyps. The primary colonoscopy strategy is both more effective and less costly than the combination of flexible sigmoidoscopy and barium enema. The optimal strategy will vary with local factors, and with the perspective of the decision-maker.\r"

Increasing doses of URO-EGF progressively raised the two hour collection of metaphases and intestinal weights. Intravenous infusion of URO-EGF was also effective in restoring cell proliferation when it was infused after the intestine had become hypoproliferative. beta-urogastrone/human epidermal growth factor administered through an intragastric cannulae thrice daily had no significant effect on intestinal weight or crypt cell production rate or metaphase collection.

  ".W": "There is evidence that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has an action in the inner medullary collecting duct. In addition, the prehypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rat has an intrinsic tendency toward less natriuresis than the Dahl salt-resistant (R) rat has when challenged with ANF. To test the hypothesis that renal papillary collecting tubule cells from prehypertensive S rats might be genetically less responsive to ANF, S and R cells were grown in culture and studied for responsiveness to ANF by measurement of cyclic nucleotide responses. There was a concentration-dependent effect of ANF on renal papillary collecting tubule cell synthesis of intracellular cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in both strains. However, the S cells were hyporesponsive compared with the R cells (p less than 0.002, by analysis of variance). Likewise, in response to Na nitroprusside, the S cells were hyporesponsive compared with the R cells as measured by intracellular cGMP accumulation (p less than 0.03, by analysis of variance). Arginine vasopressin stimulated intracellular cAMP equally in both strains. Also, ANF equally enhanced intracellular cGMP in glomerular mesangial cells from S and R rats, indicating possible specificity of the reduced responsiveness to ANF to the distal nephron of S rats. Plasma ANF levels had a slight tendency to be higher in prehypertensive S rats than in R rats (p = 0.088, by t test). These results suggest that the papillary collecting duct of Dahl S and R rats may differ in guanylate cyclase activity. This difference may partially explain the impaired natriuretic responses of S rats and could represent a factor contributing to the development of salt-sensitive hypertension.\r"

In the present study, we have found that this relaxant response can be converted to a contractile response by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. Contraction was dose-dependent and was blocked by the B1 receptor antagonist [Leu8]des-Arg9-bradykinin, with a pA2 value obtained by Schild regression similar to that reported for relaxation in the absence of indomethacin. Des-Arg10-kallidin (ED50 = 5.0 +/- 0.9 X 10(-9) M) was 16 times more potent than des-Arg9-bradykinin (ED50 = 8.1 +/- 0.8 X 10(-8) M) in contracting the indomethacin-treated artery and was also blocked by [Leu8]des-Arg9-bradykinin. In contrast, only 13 out of 24 indomethacin-treated vessels contracted in response to bradykinin, which had only one tenth and one 160th the potency (ED50 = 9.9 +/- 1.8 X 10(-7) M) of des-Arg9-bradykinin and des-Arg10-kallidin, respectively. B1 kinin receptor-mediated contraction in the presence of indomethacin was unaffected by the dual cyclooxygenase-lipoxygenase inhibitor BW 755c. These results indicate that des-Arg-kinins can stimulate both relaxation and contraction of the phenylephrine-precontracted rabbit mesenteric artery through stimulation of B1 kinin receptors. The relaxation is dependent on the release of prostaglandins, while the contraction may represent a direct effect.\r"

The erythrocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and humans with untreated essential hypertension were examined and compared with their normotensive counterparts, and electron spin resonance spectra were obtained for a fatty spin-label agent (5-nitroxy stearate) incorporated into the erythrocyte membranes. The value of outer hyperfine splitting (2T' parallel) was significantly higher in erythrocytes of SHR and humans with essential hypertension than in erythrocytes of normotensive controls (at 37 degrees C: SHR, 56.14 +/- 0.51 gauss [G], n = 8; Wistar-Kyoto rats, 52.22 +/- 0.86 G, n = 4, p less than 0.01; humans with essential hypertension, 56.94 +/- 0.27 G, n = 11; normotensive subjects, 55.44 +/- 0.36 G, n = 8, p less than 0.01). The order parameter (S) was also increased in the hypertensive rats and humans compared to their respective normotensive controls. When calcium was loaded to erythrocytes with calcium ionophore A23187 (0.9 microM) and CaCl2 (1.0 mM), the parameters of the spectra were increased. These changes were more prominent in the hypertensive groups than in the normotensive controls. These results revealed that the erythrocyte membranes of the hypertensive subjects tolerated different spin motions than those of the normotensive controls in the electron spin resonance study and that membrane fluidity might be decreased in hypertension. Additionally, calcium loading to erythrocytes caused the reduction of membrane fluidity. Therefore, it is suggested that an abnormality of calcium handling at the cellular level might affect physical properties of the biomembranes in hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effect of cardiogenic gas mixing on gas exchange we measured arterial tension of O2 (PaO2) and arterial tension of CO2 (PaCO2) during 3- to 5-min breath holds (BH) before and after infusing 50 ml of saline into the pericardial space (PCF) of seven anesthetized, paralyzed, mechanically ventilated dogs. During BH the ventilator was disconnected and a bias flow of 50% O2 at 4-5 l/min was delivered through the side ports of a small catheter whose tip was positioned 1 cm cephalad of the carina. Paired runs, alternately with and without PCF, were performed in triplicate in each dog. Initial PaO2 was similar for control runs [81 +/- 3 mmHg (SE)] and PCF runs (78 +/- 3 mmHg; P greater than 0.1). After 3-min BH, PaO2 in PCF runs (33 +/- 3 mmHg) was less than that in control runs (58 +/- 4 mmHg) (P less than 0.001). In contrast, the pattern of PaCO2 during BH did not differ with PCF. After 3-min BH, PaCO2 was 49 +/- 3 mmHg with PCF and 49 +/- 2 mmHg in the control runs (P greater than 0.7). In two dogs, repeated 50-ml reductions in lung volume, produced by rib cage compression, did not alter the time course of PaO2 during BH. Although cardiac output decreased slightly with PCF, hemodynamic changes due to PCF were unlikely to account for the observed fall in PaO2. Our results indicate a substantial effect of cardiogenic gas mixing on O2 uptake when tracheal gas is O2 enriched during breath holding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87250089\r", 
  ".W": "The intrinsic relationship between ventilation (VE) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) is described by the modified alveolar ventilation equation VE = VCO2 k/PaCO2(1-VD/VT) where PaCO2 is the partial pressure of CO2 in the arterial blood and VD/VT is the dead space fraction of the tidal volume. Previous investigators have reported that high-intensity exercise uncouples VE from VCO2; however, they did not measure the PaCO2 and VD/VT components of the overall relationship. In an attempt to provide a more complete analysis of the effects of high-intensity exercise on the VE-VCO2 relationship, we undertook an investigation where five subjects volunteered to perform three steady-state tests (SS1, SS2, SS3) at 60 W. One week after SS1 each subject was required to perform repeated 1-min bouts of exercise corresponding to a work rate of approximately 140% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Two and 24 h later the subjects performed SS2 and SS3, respectively. This exercise intervention caused PaCO2 during SS2 and SS3 to be regulated (P less than 0.01) approximately 4 Torr below the control (SS1) value of 38.8 Torr. Additionally, significant alterations were noted for VCO2 with corresponding values of 1.15 (SS1), 1.10 (SS2), and 1.04 (SS3) l/min. No changes were noted in either VD/VT or VE. In summary, it seems reasonable to suggest that the disproportionate increase in VE with respect to VCO2 noted in earlier work does not reflect an uncoupling. Rather the slope of the VE-VCO2 relationship is increased in a predictable manner as described by the modified alveolar ventilation equation.\r"

  ".W": "Lung volume changes during CO2 inhalation and exercise were compared in seven human subjects. Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) normalized by vital capacity (VC) was used as an index of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). Work loads tried were 30, 60, and 90 W and inspired CO2 concentrations were 3.5 and 5.0%. Exercise at 30 W led to a significant decrease in EELV, by 7% VC (P less than 0.005), with no further change at higher levels of exercise (P greater than 0.1). Both 3.5 and 5.0% CO2 inhalation resulted in an increase in EELV that was not statistically significant (3% VC, P greater than 0.1). A possible linkage of this different EELV behavior to breathing pattern was tested. The tidal volume-inspiratory duration curve shifted to a higher volume region during exercise compared with CO2 inhalation. Consequently, the volume-time threshold characteristic was better described by an end-inspiratory lung volume-inspiratory duration plot, resulting in a common relationship under these two different stimuli. These results suggest that the depth and rate of breathing in humans can be affected by not only phasic but also tonic components. A decrease in functional residual capacity or EELV was peculiar to exercise and should be associated with increased mechanical efficiency compared with CO2 inhalation. Theoretical predictions based on work of breathing optimization via a decreased EELV seemed to be capable of explaining isocapnic exercise hyperpnea in conjunction with proportional control of arterial CO2 tension.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that the polyamines, a family of low-molecular-weight organic cations with documented regulatory roles in cell growth and differentiation, are mediators of chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling. Relative to room air controls, chronically hypoxic animals (inspired O2 fraction = 0.1; 21 days) exhibited higher pulmonary arterial pressures (measured in room air), thicker medial layers in pulmonary arteries of 50-100 microns diam, increased hematocrits, and right ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, lung contents of the polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were greater in hypoxic animals than in controls. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of polyamine synthesis, attenuated the hypoxia-induced elevations in lung putrescine and spermidine content and blunted the increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and medial thickness. Neither the increased hematocrit nor right ventricular hypertrophy associated with chronic hypoxia were abrogated by DFMO. In addition, DFMO failed to influence vasoconstrictor responses provoked by acute hypoxic ventilation in isolated, buffer-perfused rat lungs. These observations suggest that depression of polyamine biosynthesis with DFMO blunts the sustained increase in pulmonary arterial pressure by attenuating hypoxia-induced medial thickening.\r"

We measured collateral resistance (Rcs) before and after periods of elevated airflow using a wedged bronchoscope technique. As flow rate increased, Taw dropped and postchallenge Rcs rose. A significant negative correlation was found between Taw recorded during challenge and Rcs observed 5 min after challenge. Repetitive dry air challenge produced similar changes in Rcs and Taw. However, responses to warm moist air were significantly lower than consecutive responses to dry air. Taw was significantly lower during dry air challenge than during moist air challenge. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg) and atropine (1 mg/kg) reduced responses to dry airflow challenge. Indomethacin did not affect Taw during the challenge, whereas atropine reduced the fall in Taw. We conclude that temperature correlates negatively with peripheral lung tone 5 min after dry air challenge. This correlation holds under conditions where airflow is increased, air is humidified, or atropine is administered. The dissociation between Taw and physiological response after indomethacin likely reflects a decrease in mediators released during challenge.\r"

Propranolol (PROP, 80 mg twice daily), atenolol (ATEN, 100 mg once a day) and placebo (PLAC) were administered in a randomized double-blind design. In both subject groups both drugs attenuated the increases in VT associated with increasing work rate. CO2 production (VCO2) was not changed by either drug during submaximal exercise but was reduced in both subject groups by both drugs during maximal exercise. The relationship between minute ventilation (VE) and VCO2 was unaltered by either drug in both subject groups due to increases in breathing frequency. In trained subjects VT was reduced during maximal exercise from 2.58 l/breath on PLAC to 2.21 l/breath on PROP and to 2.44 l/breath on ATEN. In untrained subjects VT at maximal exercise was reduced from 2.30 l/breath on PLAC to 1.99 on PROP and 2.12 on ATEN. These observations indicate that 1) since VE vs. VCO2 was not altered by beta-adrenergic blockade, the changes in VT and f did not result from a general blunting of the ventilatory response to exercise during beta-adrenergic blockade; and 2) blockade of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors with PROP caused larger reductions in VT compared with blockade of beta 1-receptors only (ATEN), suggesting that beta 2-mediated bronchodilation plays a role in the VT response to heavy exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of normobaric hyperoxia on carotid body chemosensory function in the cat were studied. The hypothesis was that carotid body chemosensory function would be affected by chronic exposure to 100% O2 at sea level. It was based on the assumptions that carotid body tissue is exposed to high PO2 because of its high blood flow and that its O2 chemosensing mechanism is sensitive to O2 radical-induced reactions. Twelve cats were exposed to 100% O2 for 60-67 h, and 10 control cats were maintained in room air at sea level. They were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal), and chemosensory afferents from a cut carotid sinus nerve were isolated and identified. The responses of single or a few clearly identifiable chemoreceptor afferents to isocapnic hypoxia and hypercapnia during hyperoxia and to the bolus injections of cyanide, nicotine, and dopamine were studied. We found that chronic hyperoxia severely blunted or eliminated the O2-sensitive response of the carotid chemoreceptors while augmenting the hypercapnic response. The response to cyanide but not to nicotine and dopamine were attenuated. Thus the hypoxic and hypercapnic responses that normally interact were separable. The lack of the cyanide response was consistent with the lack of the hypoxic response, suggesting a possible shared mechanism of carotid chemoreceptor response. Qualitatively normal responses to dopamine and nicotine indicated that the respective receptors were relatively intact after chronic exposure to hyperoxia and that the sensory nerves themselves were not affected by the prolonged O2 exposure.\r"

Subjects rebreathed a mixture of 8% CO2-92% O2 and commenced breath holding after reaching an alveolar plateau. At all volumes, regular rhythmic contractions of inspiratory muscles, followed by means of gastric and pleural pressures, increased in amplitude and frequency until the breakpoint. Expiratory muscle activity was more prominent in some subjects than others, and increased through each breath hold. Increasing lung volume caused a delay in onset and a decrease in frequency of contractions with no consistent change in duty cycle and a decline in magnitude of esophageal pressure swings that could be accounted for by force-length and geometric properties. The effect of lung volume on the timing of contractions most resembled that of a chest wall reflex and is consistent with the hypothesis that the contractions are a major source of dyspnea in breath holding.\r"

These impair the precision of characterizing nonsteady-state gas exchange kinetics during exercise. We quantified the effects of this noise on the confidence of estimating kinetic parameters of the underlying physiological responses and hence of model discrimination. Five subjects each performed eight transitions from 0 to 100 W on a cycle ergometer. Ventilation, CO2 output, and O2 uptake were computed breath by breath. The eight responses were interpolated uniformly, time aligned, and averaged for each subject; and the kinetic parameters of a first-order model (i.e., the time constant and time delay) were then estimated using three methods: linear least squares, nonlinear least squares, and maximum likelihood. The breath-by-breath noise approximated an uncorrelated Gaussian stochastic process, with a standard deviation that was largely independent of metabolic rate. An expression has therefore been derived for the number of square-wave repetitions required for a specified parameter confidence using methods b and c; method a being less appropriate for parameter estimation of noisy gas exchange kinetics.\r"

Intravenous injections of arachidonic acid and PGH2 caused dose-related increases in transpulmonary pressure and lung resistance and decreases in dynamic and static compliance. OKY 1581 significantly decreased airway responses to arachidonic acid but not to PGH2. Sodium meclofenamate, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, abolished airway responses to arachidonic acid but had no effect on airway responses to PGH2. OKY 1581 or meclofenamate has no effect on airway responses to PGF2 alpha, PGD2, or U 46619, a thromboxane mimic. In microsomal fractions from the lung, OKY 1581 inhibited thromboxane formation without decreasing prostacyclin synthesis or cyclooxygenase activity. These studies show that OKY 1581 is a selective thromboxane synthesis inhibitor in the cat lung and suggest that a substantial part of the bronchoconstrictor response to arachidonic acid is due to thromboxane A2 formation. Moreover, the present data suggest that airway responses to endogenously released and exogenous PGH2 are mediated differently and that a significant part of the response to exogenous PGH2 may be due to activation of an endoperoxide/thromboxane receptor, since responses to PGH2 are blocked by the thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 29548.\r"

Ignoring CO2 effects can produce up to a 6.4% error in estimates of O2 consumption, and errors due to water vapor effects can exceed 100%. Techniques are presented for minimizing potential errors and for measuring CO2 and water vapor concentrations with an O2 analyzer so that potential errors can be eliminated.\r"

Four cross-unions were Type 1 (distal intra-articular part of the radius and ulna); fourteen, Type 2 (middle third or non-articular part of the distal third of the radius and ulna); and ten, Type 3 (proximal third of the radius and ulna). Type-1 cross-union occurred rarely, but it developed most commonly after closed reduction of a fracture. Types 2 and 3 typically followed severe local trauma and delayed open reduction. Bone fragments left in the interosseous space and bone screws that broached the opposite part of the cortex were common findings. Seventeen cross-unions were excised. Three of the four Type-1, none of the ten Type-2, and two of three Type-3 cross-unions recurred. The results after excision of Type-2 cross-unions in our series were far better than other results that have been previously reported.\r"

Three of the four Type-2 cross-unions were excised; one of them recurred. Type-3 cross-unions occurred equally after closed or open reduction of a fracture. Three patients with a Type-3 cross-union had excision of the radial head. The only patient who did not have a recurrence of the cross-union also underwent insertion of a prosthesis for the radial head. The results after resection of a cross-union appear to be better in the adult than in the child, although the number of patients in this and other studies is too small to allow firm conclusions.\r"

Cultures of material and specimens of tissue that were taken intraoperatively were positive in four hips. The mean functional rating of the hip was 62 points preoperatively and 85 points at final follow-up. Thirty-one patients had a good result; one had to have a revision because of loosening of a component. Six patients had reactivation of the disease that was controlled satisfactorily by chemotherapy alone or in combination with debridement of sinus tracts without removal of the prosthesis. There was a major difference in the percentage of recurrences in patients who had inactive disease for less than ten years (six of fifteen patients) compared with those who had inactive disease for more than ten years (no patients). Total hip arthroplasty appears to be a safe procedure for patients who have quiescent tuberculosis as well as for patients who have active tuberculosis of the hip when there is no gross evidence of active infection.\r"

To our knowledge, no descriptions of the fracture pattern of these injuries and the surgical technique for treating them are available, and surgical results with this fracture have been disappointing. Discontinuity of the fibula as a result of comminution makes accurate assessment of fibular length and rotation impossible if the fibula is reduced first. Anatomical stabilization of the talus beneath the tibia is achieved by reduction and fixation of the medial malleolus. The fibular malleolus is then anatomically positioned in the lateral articular facet of the talus and fixed in this position. The osseous discontinuity of the fibula is grafted with bone. Clinical and radiographic results of the technique were highly satisfactory after a mean length of follow-up of thirty-four months.\r"

From the 7th to the 14th day after OVR, 9 women received DXM (2.25 mg/day) and 13 women received placebo (control women). Plasma FSH and LH concentrations were measured before OVR and daily from the 7th to the 14th day after surgery. In addition, the FSH and LH responses to exogenous GnRH (10 micrograms, iv bolus dose) were determined in all DXM-treated women and in 5 control women on the 7th and 14th days after surgery. Plasma gonadotropin levels increased similarly in all women on the 7th day after OVR. DXM administration significantly limited (P less than 0.001) the progressive rise of basal LH and FSH levels from days 7 to 14. DXM treatment also blunted (P less than 0.005) the OVR-induced increase in the responsiveness of both LH and FSH to exogenous GnRH. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids inhibit the secretion of both gonadotropins at the pituitary level in ovariectomized women.\r"

LH secretion (assessed as area under the curve) decreased 35% and 21%, and cortisol increased 37% and 90%, 1-3 h after single iv injections of 200 and 500 micrograms oCRH, respectively (P less than 0.05 vs. pre-CRH control period; n = 4-7/dose). Single injections of 200 and 500 micrograms hCRH, respectively, resulted in 35% and 24% decreases in LH and 40% and 79% increases in cortisol secretion (P less than 0.05). Injections of 100 micrograms oCRH and hCRH elicited significant (P less than 0.05) increases in cortisol release (37% and 31%, respectively), but did not affect LH secretion. A 5-h infusion of hCRH (100 micrograms/h) reduced LH levels (23%, 49%, 59%, 61%, and 62% during the first through the fifth hour, respectively; P less than 0.05 for hours 2-5). FSH secretion also decreased during the hCRH infusion (26%, 33%, 42%, 46%, and 49% during the first through the fifth hour, respectively; P less than 0.05 for hours 3-5), while cortisol increased 76%. These data demonstrate that exogenous CRH administration results in inhibition of LH and FSH secretion in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated CRH levels could contribute to decreased LH and FSH secretion and, thus, disruption of reproduction function under conditions of stress in primates.\r"

  ".W": "Six children with short stature and partial GH deficiency in response to two pharmacological tests received GHRH for 12 months (10 micrograms/kg X day, sc) each evening. Twenty-four-hour GH secretion was studied before and after 3 and 12 months of treatment, and GHRH tests (2 micrograms/kg, iv) were done before and after 6 months of treatment. Plasma somatomedin-C was measured before and after 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. Statural growth was measured at 3-month intervals. Mean growth velocity increased from 4.2 to 8.6 cm/yr, with a good result in five children and no response in the other. The growth response was substantial during the first 3 months. It was maintained during the following 6 months, and then decreased during the last 3 months. The peak plasma GH level in response to GHRH increased from 34.5 +/- 14.2 (+/-SD) ng/mL before treatment to 47.8 +/- 3.4 ng/mL after 6 months of treatment. Twenty-four-hour GH secretion increased in all parameters at 3 months (maximum peak, area under the curve, integrated concentration, and number of peaks) and at 12 months (with the exception of the maximum peak). Nycthemeral secretory profiles became normal, with reappearance of secretory pulses in two children, slight increases in three children, and no change in one child. Plasma somatomedin-C levels rose from 0.8 +/- 0.3 U/mL before treatment to 2.0 +/- 1.0 U/mL at 3 months, then decreased to 1.3 +/- 0.6 U/mL at 12 months. These results indicate that GHRH administered by sc injection for a 1-yr period stimulated growth and GH secretion. However, a decrease in activity was noted during the last 3 months of treatment. Tests for anti-GHRH antibodies were positive in the only child who did not respond to treatment.\r"

After a mean treatment period of 1.14 yr (range, 0.6-1.75 yr) we did not find a reduction of predicted adult height [difference, -0.5 +/- 3.5 (+/- SD) cm according to Bayley and Pinneau's tables (P = NS) and +0.2 +/- 2.5 (+/- SD) cm according to the method of Tanner (P = NS)]. Mean peak plasma GH concentrations after TRH administration before and during bromocriptine were 51.5 +/- 49.4 and 58.5 +/- 50.7 mU/L, respectively. The wide range of the GH values may be explained by physiological variation in this age group. After ingestion of 2.5 mg bromocriptine a significant increase in plasma GH occurred within 3 h in six adolescents tested. Our results do not support the concept that bromocriptine may reduce predicted adult height in tall adolescents by decreased GH secretion or acceleration of skeletal maturation.\r"

The mean serum T3 resin uptake value and T3, FT4, and FT3 concentrations in the PT patients were significantly lower than those in the GD patients. The mean serum T4-binding globulin concentration [20.2 +/- 4.2 (+/- SD) microgram/mL] in patients with PT did not differ significantly from those in patients with GD (18.0 +/- 2.6 micrograms/mL) and normal euthyroid women (21.9 +/- 4.0 micrograms/mL). The serum T3 to T4 (nanogram per microgram) ratio was higher than 20 in 14 GD patients, but lower than 20 in all patients with PT, whereas the individual serum FT3 to FT4 ratio values considerably overlapped in the 2 groups. In patients with PT, FT4 correlated well with T4 at various times during the clinical course. These findings indicate that the elevation in serum FT4 in patients with PT is mostly due to the increase in circulating T4 levels, whereas GD patients also have some diminution in T4 binding. The serum T3 to T4 ratio, but not the FT3 to FT4 ratio, may be helpful for differentiation between the two diseases.\r"

In the presence of adequate metabolic substrate the maximum rates of Na+ pumping and lactate production saturated at 60 and 12 nmol/1 cell per h, respectively. Under physiological conditions pump and \"leak\" Na+ fluxes were similar in MAJ and normal cells. Since internal Na+ was lower in MAJ than in normal cells (Nai+ approximately 2 and 8 mmol/1 cell, respectively), we conclude that the reduction in cell Na+ allows the Na+/K+ pump in MAJ cells to operate at lower fraction of maximum capacity and to compensate for the increased number of pumps.\r"

AII was infused (125 ng/min i.p.) for 12 d via mini-osmotic pumps in four groups of rats: group I, intact rats not treated with caffeine (n = 9); group II, intact rats treated with caffeine (0.1% in drinking water, n = 9); group III, rats previously sympathectomized with 6-hydroxydopamine, but not treated with caffeine (n = 10); and group IV, rats previously sympathectomized with 6-hydroxydopamine and treated with caffeine (n = 10). Chronic low-dose AII infusions slowly elevated systolic blood pressure in all groups. Caffeine greatly augmented this slow-pressor response to AII in intact animals; however, caffeine failed to enhance AII-induced hypertension in sympathectomized rats. Caffeine pretreatment did not enhance the rapid-pressor response to acute intravenous infusions of AII. We conclude that caffeine augmented the slow-pressor effect of chronic low-dose infusions of AII via a mechanism that involved the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

Some rats were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin before transplantation. A month after transplantation the blood flow of the grafts was measured by a microsphere technique. Autotransplantation to streptozotocin-diabetic rats of approximately 500 islets did not revert the hyperglycemia, and the blood flow of these grafts was approximately 25% of that in the normoglycemic-transplanted rats. However, in insulin-treated diabetic rats the blood flow of the pancreatic graft was similar to that in the normoglycemic rats. The present results suggest that the blood flow in transplanted islets is markedly diminished by hyperglycemia and that this can be enhanced by insulin administration.\r"

A decreased insulin immunostaining was detected in islets from the splenic rat pancreas after 1.5 h of glucose stimulation. By contrast, immunofluorescence changes became apparent in islets from the duodenal pancreas only after greater than 3 h of hyperglycemia. In both cases, the immunolabeling of central B cells decreased before that of peripheral B cells. Similar changes were seen following in vivo stimulation of insulin secretion by glibenclamide. At the ultrastructural level, hyperglycemia decreased the volume density of B cell secretory granules and increased that of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. These changes were also detected earlier in central than in peripheral B cells and earlier in splenic than in duodenal islets. The data show that B cells form a heterogeneous population in vivo.\r"

Glucuronidation rates for 6 alpha-hydroxylated bile acids were 10-20 times higher than those of substrates lacking a hydroxyl group in position 6. The highest rates measured were for hyodeoxy- and hyocholic acids, and kinetic analyses were carried out using these substrates. Rigorous product identification by high-field proton nuclear magnetic resonance and by electron impact mass spectrometry of methyl ester/peracetate derivatives revealed that 6-O-beta-D-glucuronides were the exclusive products formed in these enzymatic reactions. These results, together with literature data, indicate that 6 alpha-hydroxylation followed by 6-O-glucuronidation constitutes an alternative route of excretion of toxic hydrophobic bile acids.\r"

Each induces a [Ca2+]i transient which peaks in 2 min and then falls either back to baseline (angiotensin II) or to a plateau (norepinephrine and histamine). The [Ca2+]i transient is due to the mobilization of Ca2+ from a caffeine-sensitive, intracellular pool. An elevation of [K+] to 35 mM leads to a monotonic sustained rise in [Ca2+]i which depends entirely on extracellular Ca2+, but an increase to 100 mM leads to a [Ca2+]i transient from the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Atrial natriuretic peptide does not alter basal [Ca2+]i nor inhibit the [Ca2+]i transient induced by either histamine or angiotensin II, but blocks that induced by norepinephrine, and blocks the plateau phase induced by either histamine or norepinephrine. The peptide inhibits the contractile response to all three agonists and to K+.\r"

Addition of two agonists to platelets loaded with aequorin also enhanced the observed rise in cytoplasmic ionized calcium ([Ca2+]i) in response to the second agonist if the agonists were added within 20 s of each other. Enhancement of aggregation and secretion required that an increase in [Ca2+]i (as indicated by aequorin but not necessarily indo-1) followed the first agonist, but not that the [Ca2+]i remain elevated until addition of the second agonist. Enhancement was not prevented by aspirin, ADP scavengers, or chelators of extracellular Ca2+. We conclude that a rise in [Ca2+]i induced by a first agonist \"primes\" platelets for an augmented functional response to a second agonist, which is not, however, determined by the [Ca2+]i at the time of addition of the second agonist.\r"

CDA was maintained in rats infused with DX. VE expanded plasma volume (25%), maintained glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but did not correct CDA despite increased fractional delivery of total CO2 (tCO2) out of the proximal tubule (36 +/- 2%) as compared with VE/CON (24 +/- 4%; P less than 0.05). In contrast, CC corrected CDA despite volume contraction (-16%) and lower GFR than CC/CON; proximal tCO2 delivery in CC/CDA (29 +/- 4%) did not differ from VE/CDA. CC was associated with an increment in tCO2 excretion. The data strongly suggest that maintenance and correction of CDA are primarily dependent upon total body chloride and its influences on intrarenal mechanisms and not on the demands of sodium or fluid homeostasis.\r"

Pathological findings included increased numbers of skeletal muscle mitochondria (many with proliferated, concentric cristae), cardiomegaly, fatty infiltration of the viscera, and spongy encephalopathy. Mitochondria from liver and muscle biopsies oxidized NADH-linked substrates at rates 20-50% of controls, whereas succinate oxidation by muscle mitochondria was increased. Mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity (complex I, assayed as rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidase, NADH-duroquinone reductase, and NADH-cytochrome c reductase) was 0-10% of controls, and NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity was 25-50% of controls in the mitochondria and in skin fibroblasts. Activities of other electron transport complexes and related enzymes were normal. Familial deficiency of a component of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) proximal to the rotenone-sensitive site thus accounts for this disorder.\r"

Serum-sensitive N. gonorrhoeae stimulated C-dependent chemotaxis when opsonized with IgM, but not IgG, however, serum-resistant strains, taken as a whole, failed to promote chemotaxis when opsonized with either isotype. IgM titers in NHS against lipooligosaccharide (LOS) antigens from individual serum-sensitive, but not serum-resistant strains, correlated with the magnitude of chemotaxis generated by the corresponding opsonized strains (r = 0.99). Western blots demonstrated that IgM and IgG from NHS recognized different antigenic determinants on LOS from serum-sensitive gonococci. IgM from NHS immunopurified against serum-sensitive LOS accounted for two-thirds of the chemotaxis promoting activity present in whole serum. IgG titers in NHS against LOS antigens from individual serum-resistant strains also correlated with magnitude of chemotaxis generated by the corresponding opsonized strains (r = 0.87), although most opsonized serum-resistant strains did not generate significantly higher magnitudes of chemotaxis than controls. In contrast, a serum-resistant isolate from a patient with disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) stimulated chemotaxis when opsonized with IgG obtained from the patient's convalescent serum. By Western blot, convalescent IgG antibody recognized an additional determinant on serum-resistant LOS not seen by normal IgG.\r"

Physiological increments in plasma insulin but not glucose increased the fractional activity of glycogen synthase. The ED50: s for insulin stimulation of whole body and forearm glucose disposal were similar and unaffected by glycemia. Glycogen synthase activation was exponentially related to the insulin-mediated component of whole body and forearm glucose disposal at each glucose concentration. Neither insulin nor glucose changed glycogen phosphorylase activity. These results suggest that insulin but not the rate of glucose disposal per se regulates glycogen synthesis by a mechanism that involves dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase but not phosphorylase. This implies that the low glycogen synthase activities found in insulin-resistant states are a consequence of impaired insulin action rather than reduced glucose disposal.\r"

  ".U": "87251797\r", 
  ".W": "Vasomotility of normal and stenosed coronary arteries was studied at rest and during supine bicycle exercise in 10 patients with classical exercise-induced angina pectoris receiving 1 mg intracoronary propranolol before the exercise test (propranolol group). Normal and stenotic coronary lumen areas were determined from biplane coronary arteriograms using a computer-assisted system. Measurements were performed at rest, after 1 mg intracoronary propranolol, during supine exercise (89 W for 3.4 minutes) and 5 minutes after 1.6 mg sublingual nitroglycerin administered at the end of the exercise test. The results were compared with previously obtained data on the effect of dynamic exercise on coronary lumen area in 12 patients receiving no medication (control group) and in 6 patients receiving 0.1 mg intracoronary nitroglycerin before the exercise test (nitroglycerin group). In the control group, coronary stenosis area decreased during exercise to 71% of levels at rest (p less than 0.001) whereas normal coronary lumen area increased to 123% of control (p less than 0.01). In the propranolol group both normal (113%, p less than 0.05 versus rest) and stenotic coronary lumen area (122%, p less than 0.05 versus rest) increased during exercise. A similar increase in both normal and stenotic areas was observed during exercise after pretreatment with 0.1 mg intracoronary nitroglycerin (123%, p less than 0.01 and 114%, p = NS versus rest). Sublingual administration of 1.6 mg nitroglycerin at the end of exercise increased coronary stenosis area to 145% (p less than 0.01 versus rest) in the propranolol group and to 115% in the control group (p = NS versus rest). It is concluded that intracoronary administration of propranolol does not potentiate coronary vasoconstriction of the epicardial vessels at rest and during exercise. In contrast, intracoronary propranolol prevents exercise-induced stenosis narrowing either because of reduced myocardial oxygen demand with a lower coronary blood flow resulting in a smaller transstenotic pressure gradient and, thus, a smaller flow-induced fall in stenosis distending pressure; or because of \"local\" beta-receptor blockade with unopposed distal arteriolar alpha-receptor tone, resulting in a higher poststenotic pressure and, thus, in a greater stenosis distending pressure; or because of a local anesthetic effect of propranolol with a decrease in calcium influx to the coronary smooth musculature.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with mitral stenosis, valve orifice calculations using pulmonary capillary wedge pressure as a substitute for left atrial pressure may overestimate the severity of disease. Previous studies have shown that mitral valve area determined from transseptal left atrial pressure measurements exceeds that area derived from pulmonary wedge pressure measurements. This is probably due to pulmonary venoconstriction, which is reversed by nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin, 0.4 mg, was administered sublingually to 20 patients with mitral valve disease during preoperative cardiac catheterization using the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure as the proximal hydraulic variable. At the time of a peak hypotensive effect, 3 to 5 minutes after nitroglycerin administration, the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 23 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) to 19 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). The mean diastolic transmitral pressure gradient (12.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg before and 11.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg after nitroglycerin; p = NS) and cardiac output (4.0 +/- 0.3 to 4.1 +/- 0.3 liters/min; p = NS) did not change significantly. Nevertheless, the hemodynamic mitral orifice area, calculated using the Gorlin formula, increased from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.1 +/- 0.2 cm2 (p less than 0.05). In 12 patients with isolated mitral stenosis, without regurgitation, the mitral valve orifice area after nitroglycerin was 0.4 +/- 0.2 cm2 larger than it was before drug administration (p less than 0.05). Administration of nitroglycerin during evaluation of mitral stenosis eliminates pulmonary venoconstriction, which raises the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure above the left atrial pressure in some patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In neither were the left-sided Mahaim connections components of a tachycardia and their presence was incidental. In two of four with nodoventricular connections, associated atrioventricular (AV) node conduction and coexistent posteroseptal accessory pathways were found. One of these had the unusual finding of a right-sided Mahaim connection arising from a \"fast\" AV node pathway. In only one patient did the tachycardia incorporate the Mahaim connection. In this patient, anterograde conduction during tachycardia occurred over a right nodoventricular connection whereas retrograde conduction occurred through a concealed right free wall Kent connection. Two patients had fasciculoventricular connections that were associated with either septal (one patient) or left free wall (one patient) Kent connections. The latter also had evidence of enhanced AV node conduction. This report is unique in that it describes in detail two patients with left nodoventricular connections (Mahaim) inserting in or near the left posterior fascicle. Combined Kent and Mahaim connections, present in the six patients, appear to occur in approximately 5% of patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Precise identification of bypass connections critical for reentrant circuits is essential for intelligent application of treatment options.\r"

Slow pathway conduction was inversely related to the preceding sinus cycle length and fast pathway conduction was determined by the Hs-A interval (measured from the His potential due to slow pathway conduction to the onset of the subsequent atrial electrogram). Major determinants of sustained simultaneous anterograde fast and slow pathway conduction during sinus rhythm were 1) a retrograde unidirectional block in both fast and slow pathways, and 2) a critical conduction delay in the slow pathway and a long enough Hs-A interval to allow sequential conduction of impulse from both pathways. Flecainide was successful in preventing recurrences of the tachycardia by eliminating slow pathway conduction during long-term follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "Recent clinical studies indicate that disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) may have a direct effect on inflammatory cells because the drug reversed various changes in leukocyte function, such as increased membrane-receptor expression and enhanced cytotoxic capacity observed in peripheral white blood cells from subjects with asthma undergoing allergen-inhalation challenge. In the present study, we have demonstrated that DSCG, at low concentrations (a concentration of drug required to produce 50% inhibition, approximately 10(-8) mol/L) and in a time-dependent fashion, directly inhibited the activation in vitro of human neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. Peripheral blood leukocytes were incubated with the synthetic chemoattractant, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (at an optimal concentration of 10(-8) mol/L), and activation was assessed by measuring increases in the percentages of complement and IgG (Fc) rosettes as well as the enhanced capacity of these cells to kill target organisms (schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni). DSCG at a concentration of 10(-7) mol/L totally inhibited both the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced enhancement of complement and IgG rosettes, as well as increased schistosomular killing. These observations indicate that DSCG directly inhibits the secretory properties of inflammatory cells and that in turn might have important implications in modulating mechanisms contributing to the inflammatory component of asthma and allergic disease. It may also help to explain why compounds with considerably greater mast cell stabilizing properties than DSCG have been so disappointing when they are evaluated clinically.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in subjects with asthma is increased 40 to 60 minutes after challenge with ultrasonically nebulized water. This study reveals that increased responsiveness to methacholine is abolished by administration of cromolyn sodium before the water challenge. The mean dose of methacholine (95% confidence limits) inducing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was 1.10 mumol (0.43 to 2.80). The PD20 after water challenge was 0.42 mumol (0.17 to 1.01) that was significantly lower (p less than 0.005) than that observed for the initial challenge. Administration of cromolyn before the water challenge abolished this increased responsiveness to methacholine. The mean PD20 was 1.32 mumol (0.47 to 3.68) that was not significantly different from that measured for the initial methacholine challenge. Methacholine responsiveness was unchanged when challenge was performed 40 to 60 minutes after cromolyn alone or after methacholine itself. We conclude that cromolyn abolishes the increased responsiveness to methacholine and probably does so by inhibiting the release of mediators.\r"

After crossover, each group received the opposite treatment for the final 8 weeks. FEV1, FVC, and provocation concentration of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) were determined monthly and peak expiratory flow (PEF) daily throughout the study. A significant increase in FEV1, FVC, and PEF (p less than 0.01) was observed after BDP treatment was started, and likewise, in the second period, an increase in both FEV1 and PEF (p less than 0.05) was observed. The total effect on logarithm-natural (Ln) (PC20), i.e., the mean effects of the two periods, was also significant (p less than 0.01). SCG, however, was most effective when it was used as the first drug, indicated by a significant increase in FVC in the first period (p less than 0.05). Neither in the first nor in the second period did SCG treatment influence the Ln (PC20) value positively, and the SCG treatment administered in the second period could not maintain the improvement in the pulmonary function (i.e., FEV1, FVC, and PEF) obtained initially with the BDP treatment. When the effect of BDP on FEV1, FVC, PEF, and Ln (PC20) was compared to the effect of SCG in the first 8-week treatment period, no significant difference was observed (p greater than 0.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of 12 patients, a larger dose (300 mg bid) was evaluated for its suppression of titrated skin tests to histamine and compound 48/80 to determine whether this regimen might result in greater suppression while it maintained the freedom from side effects of the presently recommended dose. In seven patients, skin test suppression by these two doses of terfenadine each administered for 3 days, was compared to that produced in an earlier study by 3 days of treatment with chlorpheniramine (8 mg three times a day). The 300 mg bid terfenadine regimen produced significantly greater skin test suppression (p less than 0.05) than the currently recommended 60 mg bid dose. There was no significant difference in side effects between the two doses, and neither active treatment regimen produced more side effects than placebo treatment. Both doses of terfenadine suppressed cutaneous reactivity significantly more than had chlorpheniramine. It is concluded that the presently recommended dose of terfenadine produces submaximal skin test suppression and that further studies are needed to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of larger doses of terfenadine in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.\r"

However, this mode of nutrition therapy is not without problems. Aside from mechanical and other metabolic complications, a peculiar metabolic bone disease has been reported to occur in some HTPN recipients. The disease, characterized by abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, often results in osteomalacia, bone pain, and fractures. Reports of approximately 50 cases of metabolic bone disease have been published by centers in the United States and Canada. Factors that have been implicated as possible causes include infusion of excess vitamin D, aluminum, calcium, protein, or glucose; cyclic vs. continuous TPN administration; and the patient's previous nutritional state. Although removal of vitamin D or aluminum from the TPN solution and discontinuation of TPN altogether have been associated with improvement in symptoms, histology, and laboratory values, no single factor has been identified as the cause of this troubling phenomenon.\r"

We observed a 66% decrease in basal TRH release by incubated rat hypothalami with aging. Thyroid hormone-responsive hepatic alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) and malic enzyme (ME) levels in aged rats did not differ from 5-month-old controls in spite of a significant fall in serum thyroxine (T4) levels with aging. Other results suggest that these particular indicators of thyroidal status should not change in the aging rat because serum T3 is maintained in the normal range. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels, which normally rise when serum T4 levels decline, did not change with aging. These data suggest that gradual loss of the essential TRH stimulation of TSH release with aging may be compensated for by a decline in T4 inhibition of TSH release at the pituitary.\r"

Precise enumeration of transferred cell populations in recipient organs was performed by limiting dilution analysis. The results obtained confirm previous findings on the short life-span of IL 2p cells. They also demonstrate that: the transferred populations containing IL 2p were capable of continuous renewal and expansion in the host; IL 2p cell expansion, a transient event that takes place predominantly in lymph nodes, is much reduced when injected cells are depleted of recent thymus migrants; in steady-state conditions, IL 2p T cells do not lose their self-renewal ability and maintain population sizes by continuous cell production and death in peripheral pools. The self-renewal capacity, the expansion potential of peripheral IL 2p T cells and, in particular, of recent thymus migrants may allow extensive post-thymic modulation of peripheral T cell specificities, suggesting that post-thymic selection may have a major role in the establishment of the available and actual mature IL 2p T cell repertoire.\r"

When the clone was stimulated with the antigen and irradiated spleen cells, the clone expressed an adequate amount of IL 2R on the surface in flow cytometric analysis. On the other hand, the clone expressed the receptor only poorly, being stimulated with B cell APC. The findings were confirmed by Western blot analysis on the clone solubilized by Nonidet P-40 and also by fluorescent antibody technique on the fixed clone. 24-2C.3 clone stimulated with B cell APC was also suggested not to secrete IL 2R in culture medium. In dot blot hybridization analysis performed with cDNA probe, however, 24-2C.3 clone stimulated with B cell APC was shown to express a comparable amount of IL 2R mRNA to the clone stimulated with whole spleen cells as APC. The mRNA expressed in the clones stimulated with B cells and with spleen cells could not be distinguished from each other in Northern blot analysis. The culture supernatant of 24-2C.3 clone incubated with the antigen and irradiated spleen cells was shown to enhance the expression of IL 2R on the clone stimulated with B cell APC. These results suggest that there is some defect in the antigen-presentation capacity of B cells in terms of the elicitation of the intracellular signal for IL 2R expression in T cells and that the humoral factor(s) produced in the presence of splenic adherent cells could supply the defect.\r"

  ".W": "Cloned T cell lines specific for the antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in the context of self I-A or I-E class II MHC-encoded molecules were found to express equivalent levels of the Lyt-2 and L3T4 surface molecules by FACS analysis. Functionally, these cloned T cell lines will kill OVA-pulsed, class II MHC-bearing B lymphoma cells. This system allowed us to examine the relative contribution of the Lyt-2 and L3T4 molecules to recognition of antigen in the context of self class II MHC molecules. We find that anti-L3T4 is 25- to 100-fold more potent at inhibiting cytotoxicity by these cloned lines than is anti-Lyt-2, where potency is calculated as the ratio of the concentration needed for inhibition divided by the concentration needed for binding. Both antibodies can completely inhibit cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the accessory molecules Lyt-2 and L3T4 can play two different roles in antigen:MHC recognition. In class II MHC recognition, L3T4 plays a dominant role, highly sensitive to inhibition by anti-L3T4. By contrast, Lyt-2 plays a minor yet important role in the cell interaction, perhaps by adhesion strengthening. Previous analysis in several laboratories supports the concept that the ligand for L3T4 is class II MHC, whereas the ligand for Lyt-2 is class I MHC. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that these molecules are actually part of the T cell antigen:MHC recognition complex, and play an important role in the class of MHC molecule recognized by a T cell alpha:beta heterodimeric receptor. As such, they are not accessory proteins, but a direct part of the recognition apparatus, and the term accessory protein may apply only in those cases in which the specificity of the T cell receptor is for a different class of MHC than that normally associated with the L3T4 or Lyt-2 molecule.\r"

The epidermis was examined histologically and the incidence of two basic epidermal lesions of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), the epidermal cell necrosis (ECN) and the lichenoid hyperplastic reaction (LR), were evaluated by a semi-quantitative evaluation. During the acute phase of GVH reaction (GVHR) (days 15 to 25), there was an obvious increase in ECN in reactions elicited by minor loci, whole major histocompatability complex (MHC) differences, or a MHC class I or II difference only. Allogeneic effect without T lymphocyte/epidermis incompatibility did not induce a significant incidence of ECN. Neither depletion of the Ly-2+ nor that of the L3T4+ T lymphocyte subset by treatment with monoclonal antibody (performed in vitro, before injection or also by treatment of the recipient) did prevent the occurrence of ECN, indicating that both T lymphocyte subsets are capable of initiating the epidermal cell damage. The LR was due mainly to the T lymphocytes of the L3T4+, Ly-2- helper phenotype. During chronic GVHR (after 35 days) elicited by either Ly-2+ or L3T4+ lymphocytes, ECN and LR were no longer evident, but the number of epidermal cells and especially the number of replicating cells among the epidermal cells were markedly reduced.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the pathogenesis of immunological diseases induced by the drug D-Penicillamine (D-Pen) the requirements for sensitization to this drug were investigated. Mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into one hind footpad with a solution of D-Pen without adjuvant, and reactivity to D-Pen was determined in the popliteal lymph node assay (PLNA) by weight increase of the draining PLN, the incorporation of 3H-thymidine, and trapping of 51Cr-labeled syngeneic lymphocytes in the draining PLN. The peak of the primary PLN response was obtained between day 7 and 10 after injecting 1 mg of D-Pen per mouse. Likewise, PLN enlargement could be induced by injecting 18 hr nonadherent spleen cells s.c. that had been pretreated overnight with D-Pen in vitro. D-Pen-induced PLN enlargement was primarily caused by cell proliferation within the lymph node, and only a minor portion was due to trapping of circulating lymphocytes. The majority of the cells in the enlarged PLN were B cells; T cells, however, were required for generation of PLN enlargement. For induction of PLN reactivity to D-Pen, the stereoisomer L-Pen, and the dimer D-Pen disulfide, it was mandatory that the respective molecules were administered in ionized form. PLN reactivity to D-Pen is controlled by at least two loci, one mapping to the I region, possibly A beta A alpha, the other(s) to the non-H-2 background. As far as studied, high responsiveness was inherited dominantly. The PLN reaction proved to be antigen-specific, since D-Pen-primed mice exhibited an enhanced reaction when challenged with a suboptimal dose of D-Pen, but not when challenged with an unrelated drug, diphenylhydantoin (DPH). The possible relationship between immunity to D-Pen and autoimmunity induced by this drug is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87252199\r", 
  ".W": "Cells participating in the rIL 2-induced proliferation of resting PBMC were identified by using different methods of cell purification. NK cells recovered in the light density fraction of Percoll gradients responded, as already known, directly to rIL 2 by strong proliferation. In contrast, large T lymphocytes co-purifying with NK cells, and small T cells sedimenting in the high density area of the Percoll gradients, were virtually unresponsive when cultivated in the sole presence of rIL 2. However, the addition of either irradiated autologous monocytes or highly purified IL 1 allowed both kinds of T cells to undergo cell division. Stringent elimination of possibly contaminating NK cells (NKH-1+) and/or activated T cells (TNKTAR, Tac+, HLA-DR+) from the high density T cells by complement lysis did not impair rIL 2-induced cell proliferation, indicating entire responsiveness of these cells to the synergistic action of IL 1 plus IL 2. Both high density CD4+ and CD8+ participated in this phenomenon, with an apparent advantage for CD4+ cells. All Tac+ cells emerging in a 6-day culture of these cells expressed the WT31 antigen, which indicates that T cells involved in rIL 2-induced proliferation are conventional mature T cells. The relative precursor frequencies of NK cells, large T lymphocytes, and small T lymphocytes that proliferated in response to rIL 2 were analyzed by limiting dilution analysis. The frequencies of clonal growth of NK cells and low density T lymphocytes were approximately the same (1/103 vs 1/185), whereas that of high density T cells was four times lower (1/458). Thus, we clearly demonstrate that resting T cells, defined as such by morphological, density, and phenotypic criteria, are able to proliferate in response to IL 2 in the presence of IL 1 without antigenic or mitogenic triggering.\r"

  ".W": "T cells and T cell-derived lymphokines have been implicated in the regulation of myelopoiesis. This study examines the regulatory effects of recombinant DNA-derived human IL 2 on the phagocyte progenitor cell (CFU-GM), utilizing a receptor-specific model for T cell regulation of myelopoiesis. IL 2 receptors were induced on immunopurified marrow T cells by triggering the T cell antigen receptor complex with CD3 monoclonal antibody. IL 2 receptor expression was assessed by cytofluorography with IL 2 receptor monoclonal antibody. IL 2 receptor-positive and IL 2 receptor-negative marrow T cells were cocultured with autologous adherent and T cell-depleted marrow mononuclear cells in the absence and presence of various concentrations of IL 2. In the presence of IL 2 receptor-positive T cells, IL 2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of CFU-GM (86% at 10(2) U/ml). IL 2 did not inhibit CFU-GM in the absence of T cells or in the presence of IL 2 receptor-negative T cells. The addition of IL 2 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody completely abrogated IL 2-induced inhibition of CFU-GM. Conditioned media prepared from IL 2 receptor-positive marrow T cells in the presence of IL 2 also inhibited CFU-GM expression from marrow NAB-T cells (50% +/- 16). In contrast, conditioned media from IL 2 receptor-positive T cells prepared in the absence of IL 2 or from IL 2 receptor-negative T cells prepared in the presence or absence of IL 2 did not significantly affect CFU-GM growth. IL 2 receptor-positive, but not IL 2 receptor-negative, T cells released large amounts (190 +/- 60 U/10(6) cells X ml-1) of IFN-gamma but only low amounts of tumor necrosis factor beta (less than 10 U/ml) in response to IL 2. In control experiments, recombinant DNA-derived IFN-gamma caused a 37% +/- 19 inhibition of CFU-GM in the presence of resting T cells and adherent cells. However, IFN-gamma failed to inhibit CFU-GM in the presence of activated (IL 2 receptor-positive) T cells, indicating that release of IFN-gamma cannot solely explain IL 2-induced inhibition of CFU-GM. The addition of neutralizing IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody partially abrogated IL 2-induced inhibition of CFU-GM (41 to 60%) in the presence of CD3-triggered T cells, suggesting that although IFN-gamma participates in IL 2-induced inhibition of myelopoiesis, it is not the sole mediator of that inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The kinetics of both release and desensitization were approximately equal to 3 times faster than human basophils, but a similar relationship between release and desensitization suggests similar biochemistries in basophils and mast cells. Arachidonic acid metabolite (PGD2 and LTC4) release was slower to desensitize (t1/2 of 8 min) than histamine release (t1/2 of 3 min), the ratio of which is similar to the ratio observed in basophils. Ionophore A23187-induced release was unaffected by desensitization to anti-IgE antibody, and calcium-45 uptake was inhibited by desensitization, suggesting that desensitization inhibits the early post-cross-linking \"influx\" of calcium that is necessary for mediator release in mast cells. In contrast to the above similarities in basophil and mast cell desensitization, mast cell desensitization, unlike that of basophils was not inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) has been shown to modulate lymphocyte responses in both a positive and a negative way, depending on the particular cell subsets it interacts with. Recent evidence also indicates that LTB4 can directly affect the production of cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL 1) or interleukin 2 (IL 2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In this report, we present evidence that human T cells pulsed with LTB4 modulate IL 1 production by human monocytes by secreting IFN-gamma. In fact, we found that LTB4-pulsed T cells were capable of inducing a suppression of lymphocyte proliferation if allowed to interact with monocytes, but that this suppression was reversed to an enhancing effect when monocytes were treated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. Furthermore, LTB4-pulsed T cells released a soluble factor that would mediate both effects. This factor was found to be IFN-gamma, because affinity-purified IFN-gamma could reproduce the effects, and a rabbit polyclonal anti-serum to human IFN-gamma could block the activities of supernatants from LTB4-pulsed T cells. LTB4 was also shown to enhance IFN-gamma production by T4+ T cells and to inhibit IFN-gamma production by T8+ T cells. These results suggest that LTB4 may regulate immune cell functions by inducing IFN-gamma production by T4+ cells.\r"

Spleen and peritoneal macrophages isolated from BCG-infected donors that were producing nitrate continued to synthesize nitrite and nitrate in culture. LPS treatment in vitro (25 or 50 micrograms/ml) additionally increased this nitrite/nitrate synthesis. Thioglycolate-elicited macrophages from non-infected C3H/HeJ mice treated with LK also produced nitrite/nitrate, and concurrent LPS (0.1 to 50 micrograms/ml) treatment resulted in enhanced synthesis. Recombinant IFN-gamma also stimulated nitrite/nitrate synthesis by C3H/He and CeH/HeJ macrophages as did LPS (C3H/He only) and hk BCG. When given concurrently with either LPS or hk BCG, IFN-gamma enhanced C3H/He and C3H/HeJ macrophage nitrite/nitrate synthesis over that produced by macrophages treated with either LPS or hk BCG alone. Macrophages activated in vitro exhibited a 4 to 12 hr lag time before engaging in nitrite/nitrate synthesis, which then proceeded for 36 to 42 hr at linear rates. Daily medium renewal did not alter the synthesis kinetics but increased the total amount of nitrite/nitrate produced. Nitrate and nitrite were stable under the conditions of culture and when added did not influence additional macrophage synthesis. Taken together, these results indicate that T cell lymphokines and IFN-gamma are powerful modulators of macrophage nitrite/nitrate synthesis during BCG infection and in vitro, and nitrite/nitrate synthesis appears to be common property of both primed and fully activated macrophage populations.\r"

  ".W": "While it is extensively documented that gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) is a potent stimulator of cells of the monocyte lineage, relatively little is known about its effects on granulocytes. We and others have found that immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) by polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) is significantly enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion by 16 hours incubation with recombinant IFN-gamma, resulting in 2- to 16-fold increases in ADCC. Incubation of PMN with lipopolysaccharide for 16 hours did not augment ADCC. Since IFN-gamma enhancement of ADCC is accompanied by increased expression of Fc receptors, we used monoclonal antibodies to compare control and IFN-gamma treated PMN for expression of the high affinity Fc receptor for monomeric IgG1 (FcgRI) and the PMN receptor for polymeric IgG (FcgR1o). Freshly isolated PMN or PMN cultured without IFN-gamma expressed FcgR1o but not detectable quantities of FcgRI. However, while FcgR1o were not increased on IFN-gamma-treated PMN, these cells expressed moderate amounts of FcgRI. To determine whether FcgRI contributed to PMN function, heteroantibodies consisting of Fab 3G8 or Fab 32 linked to Fab anti-target antibody were produced. ADCC of untreated PMN was promoted only by Fab 3G8 heteroantibody, whereas IFN-gamma-treated PMN killed through both FAB 3G8 and Fab 32 heteroantibodies. Thus, FcgRI can be induced on PMN by IFN-gamma, can mediate cytotoxicity by these cells, and probably accounts for the IFN-gamma stimulation of ADCC.\r"

The isolated subsets from these lines were specifically activated by HBcAg and displayed antigen-specific help and suppression with respect to proliferation of the alternate subset. One of these lines was recently cloned by limiting dilution, and four HBcAg-specific CD3+ CD4+ CD8-DR+ T cell lines were produced that had a 95.3% likelihood of monoclonality. Antigenic specificity was confirmed by dose-dependent, HLA class II (DR)-restricted proliferation in response to recombinant and human serum-derived HBcAg and the lack of proliferation to HBV envelope antigens (HBsAg and pre-S(2)Ag). All cloned lines were interleukin 2 dependent, produced interferon-gamma in an antigen-specific manner, and provided antigen-specific help to autologous B cells with respect to anti-HBc production. We conclude that HBcAg-specific, HLA-class II restricted helper T cells capable of inducing antigen-specific functional responses by autologous B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes are present at the site of viral antigen synthesis and hepatocellular injury in HBV infection.\r"

Treatment of nude mice with antibody does not alter the lipopolysaccharide-induced polyclonal PFC response, and it only modulates the isotypic profile of the PFC response to T. cruzi infection, without reducing its magnitude. Furthermore, antibody-treated, T. cruzi-infected euthymic mice do not develop the typical B cell blastogenic response, but show high numbers of activated Lyt-2+ lymphoblasts in the spleen. These results indicate that effector cell generation in T. cruzi-infected mice is predominantly helper T cell-dependent.\r"

Most of the S epsilon sequence differences observed between the two strains were single base pair substitutions, deletions, or insertions. The largest difference between the S epsilon sequences resulted from an insertion of seven contiguous bases seen in the SJL S epsilon region.\r"

  ".W": "The primary (1 degree) antibody response to (T,G)-A--L shows limited heterogeneity, consisting mostly of side chain-specific antibodies that bind GT and that express the TGB5 idiotype (Id). The secondary (2 degrees) response is very diverse: antibodies that bind the backbone A--L constitute a third of the response, and a high proportion of the side chain-specific antibodies do not bind GT and are TGB5 Id-. To provide a molecular basis for understanding this difference in repertoire expression, we analyzed the Ig genes used by heavy and light chains of 1 degree and 2 degrees side chain-specific anti-(T,G)-A--L hybridoma antibodies (HP). Southern blot restriction analysis and nucleotide sequence analysis of the expressed genes used by three TGB5 Id+ 2 degrees HP showed usage of three different VH genes in two VH gene families (36-60 and J558), different D segments, and two different Vk1 genes (the Vk1A and Vk1C subgroups). Thus, antibody heterogeneity in the 2 degrees response is contributed by combinatorial diversity of distinct germ-line genes. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the expressed genes used by TGB5 Id+ 1 degree HP showed use of highly homologous VH genes in the J558 VH gene family and highly homologous Vk1A genes. The majority of TGB5 Id+ 1 degree HP from different donors gave similar heavy and similar light chain gene rearrangements by Southern blot restriction analysis, after correction for known or potential J region differences. The combined nucleotide sequence and Southern blot restriction analysis data suggest that most 1 degree B cells use the same or very similar VH and Vk genes, i.e., the 1 degree response is paucigenic. Different D segments were used by the TGB5 Id+ 1 degree and 2 degrees HP that were sequenced, and there was no apparent correlation between TGB5 idiotypy and VH, D gene, or JH gene usage. However, all TGB5 Id+ HP sequenced used highly homologous genes from the Vk1 group. Expression of a Vk1 light chain correlates with, but is not sufficient for, TGB5 idiotypy, because one GT-binding, TGB5 Id- HP was found to use a Vk1C subgroup light chain. By Southern blot and nucleotide sequence analysis, the Vk genes used by two TGB5 Id+ 2 degrees HP from xid mice are highly homologous, if not identical to the Vk1A gene(s) used by 1 degree and 2 degrees Id+ HP from wild-type mice.\r"

  ".W": "The B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12) mouse possesses a naturally occurring mutation in its class II MHC A beta gene. The three amino acid substitutions at positions 67, 70, and 71 that comprise this mutation lead to changes in both Ia expression and immune recognition of the resultant A beta A alpha molecule. The experiments reported here utilize a combination of oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis and DNA-mediated gene transfer to explore the roles played by each of the three mutant residues in these various phenotypic changes. A beta genes comprising all permutations of the residues distinguishing Ab beta from Abm12 beta were created and were individually co-transfected with Ab beta into mouse L cells. Sublines expressing high levels of membrane Ia were selected by preparative flow cytometry and were studied for reactivity with a panel of monoclonal anti-Ia antibodies, or for their ability to act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) for the stimulation of T cell hybridomas. During the generation of these transfectant lines, it was noted that expression of a high level of Abm12 beta Ab alpha was more difficult to achieve than a similar level of Ab beta Ab alpha. Northern blot analysis of specific A beta and A alpha mRNA levels in these various lines indicated that more class II mRNA, and presumably more A beta and A alpha chains, were required to achieve expression of Abm12 beta Ab alpha equal to that of Ab beta Ab alpha, suggesting that the previously noted reduction of Ia expression on cells from bm12 mice reflects a decreased ability of Abm12 beta Ab alpha chains to pair, or to reach the membrane. Staining of the panel of transfectants with monoclonal antibodies revealed that antibodies which did not distinguish Ab beta Ab alpha from Abm12 beta Ab alpha also reacted equally well with all molecules involving in vitro mutant A beta chains. Monoclonal antibodies reactive with Ab beta Ab alpha but not Abm12 beta Ab alpha were specific for an epitope primarily determined by the presence or absence of Arg 70 in Ab beta. In striking contrast, all three mutant positions were found to play crucial roles in T cell recognition, because all substitutions led to significant or complete loss of antigen-presenting function with all but one of the T hybridomas tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the present study these conjugates were used to explore the kinetics of induction of cytotoxicity in PBMC and the subpopulations of lymphocytes involved. It was found that in addition to conjugate-dependent cytotoxicity, a considerable amount of conjugate-independent cytotoxicity was generated during OKT3 stimulation. Although the conjugate-dependent activity resided in the CD8+ population, the conjugate-independent cytotoxicity was found to be a function of CD4-/CD8- natural killer-like cells. Being largely CD3-, those cells were most likely activated by lymphokines produced by OKT3-stimulated CD3+ cells. They were capable of killing not only tumor cells but also autologous lymphocytes. The CD4+ cells of some donors were found to exhibit low but clearly demonstrable cytotoxicity. Induction of cytotoxicity was characterized as an early event in T cell activation, correlating with the kinetics of RNA synthesis. Cytotoxicity, interleukin 2 receptor expression, and DNA synthesis declined after 3 days of activation with OKT3, indicating the existence of as yet undefined regulatory mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "When L3T4+ cloned murine helper T lymphocytes (HTL) are stimulated with antigen or immobilized anti-T cell receptor (TCR) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) at concentrations which are optimal for proliferation, anti-L3T4 mAb inhibits activation as measured by proliferation and lymphokine production. Under similar conditions, IL 2-independent proliferation of Lyt-2+ cloned murine cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) stimulated by anti-TCR mAb is inhibited by anti-Lyt-2 antibodies. Proliferation of cloned HTL and CTL cells stimulated by IL 2 is not affected by the anti-L3T4 and anti-Lyt-2 mAb. The inhibition of TCR-induced activation of the T cell clones is not due to interference with the binding of the anti-TCR mAb. Stimulation of the TCR has been proposed to induce lymphokine secretion and proliferation by T cells through a pathway involving the activation of protein kinase C and the stimulation of an increase in the concentration of intracellular free calcium. However, proliferation of T cells stimulated by PMA (which activates protein kinase C) plus the calcium ionophore A23187 (which increases the concentration of intracellular free calcium) is not affected by mAb reactive with the Lyt-2 or L3T4 structures. If TCR stimulation does indeed activate T cells by activating protein kinase and increasing intracellular free calcium, then our data suggest that anti-L3T4 and anti-Lyt-2 mAb inhibit TCR-driven proliferation at some step before the activation of protein kinase C and the stimulation of a rise in intracellular free calcium concentration. Our results suggest that anti-L3T4 and anti-Lyt-2 mAb interfere with early biochemical processes induced by stimulation of the TCR. In HTL, which proliferate via an autocrine pathway, anti-L3T4 mAb appears to inhibit proliferation by interfering with signaling events involved in lymphokine production. Inhibition of IL 2-independent proliferation of Lyt-2+ cells by anti-Lyt-2 mAb appears to occur by a different mechanism. The precise molecular basis for the interference of each cell type has not yet been characterized.\r"

In the present studies, a series of monoclonal antibodies to cell surface structures expressed on these subsets of cells were examined for their effects on the proliferative and immunoregulatory functions generated in AMLR. We demonstrated that anti-T4 antibody preferentially inhibited the proliferative response of the T4+2H4+ but not T4+2H4- cells against self-MHC antigens. In contrast, anti-T3 and anti-Ia antibodies inhibited the response of both subsets of cells. This subset preference of anti-T4 antibody was not attributable to either the isolation procedures used or a shift in the kinetics of proliferation to autologous self-MHC antigens. Moreover, both IL 2 production and the immunoregulatory function of the T4+2H4+ subset was profoundly inhibited by anti-T4 antibody, whereas the T4+2H4- subset was minimally influenced. In the absence of Ia molecules, T4+2H4+ but not T4+2H4- cell proliferation was inhibited with anti-T4 antibody. Together, these results suggest that the T4 molecule plays a distinct functional role in the differential triggering of subsets of T4+ cells.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies reactive with defined T lymphocyte surface antigens were covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads using the bifunctional imidoester, dimethyl pimelimidate. Sepharose-immobilized antibody reactive with T3 induced the proliferation of resting T lymphocytes in the presence of either recombinant interleukin 2 or phorbol myristate acetate. When monoclonal antibodies reactive with T3 and T4 were coupled to the same Sepharose bead (hereafter designated Sepharose (T3:T4)), proliferation was enhanced an average of three-fold. Similarly prepared Sepharose beads coupled to anti-T3 and anti-T8 also enhanced proliferation over that observed with anti-T3 alone. Sepharose (T3:T4) similarly increased the proliferation of T4+ lymphocytes and a T4+ clone but failed to enhance the proliferation of T8+ lymphocytes. The increased proliferation of T4+ lymphocytes resulted from a preferential activation of the T4+2H4- helper population over the T4+2H4+ suppressor-inducer population. The enhanced proliferation induced by Sepharose (T3:T4) could be completely inhibited by soluble anti-T4. These results suggest that perturbation of T3 may be a minimal signal for T cell activation and that the assembly of a multimeric complex including T3 and T4 may be required for optimal T cell activation.\r"

Thymic non-MHC restricted CTL expressed Leu-19 antigen, but were generated from thymic precursor cells that lacked expression of Leu-19. In contrast, short term culture in Il 2 of peripheral blood lymphocytes depleted of Leu-19+ lymphocytes did not result in the generation of cytotoxic activity. IL 2 was necessary and sufficient for the generation of cytotoxic thymocytes and induction of Leu-19 antigen expression. Thymic non-MHC restricted CTL were generated from precursor cells expressing CD1, an antigen present on the majority of thymocytes. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity was detected in IL 2 cultured thymocyte populations with an \"immature\" antigenic phenotype, i.e. CD1+ and CD4+, CD8+. Upon subsequent culture, thymic non-MHC restricted CTL lost expression of CD1, and developed an antigenic phenotype similar to peripheral blood non-MHC-restricted CTL, suggesting that peripheral non-MHC-restricted CTL may originate from these thymic precursors.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that differentiation of CD8+ Tp44- suppressor cells in pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated cultures requires soluble factors elaborated by CD4+ cells and monocytes, and that the monocyte signal for such differentiation can be replaced by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In this study, we explored the ability of interleukin 2 (IL 2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to replace the CD4+ signal. When IL 2 or IFN-gamma was used at concentrations equivalent to those present in supernatants of PWM-pulsed cultures of CD4+ cells, no effect on differentiation of CD8+ cells was observed. However, a potent suppressor inducing activity was detected when IFN-gamma, but not IL 2, was mixed with supernatants derived from cultures of PWM-pulsed purified monocytes (M phi sup) or with 10(-8) M PGE2. Differentiated CD8+ suppressor cells (Ts) inhibited both PWM-stimulated proliferative response of CD4+ cells and immunoglobulin production by B cells. The signals mediated by the M phi sup or PGE2 and IFN-gamma were shown to act sequentially. That is, M phi sup or PGE2 was required initially, followed by an IFN-gamma-dependent differentiative step. These studies thus suggest a cascade of cellular interactions involving monocytes, CD4+ cells, and CD8+ Ts precursors that are required for the differentiation of CD8+ suppressor effector cells.\r"

  ".U": "87252237\r", 
  ".W": "In rat bone marrow (BM), the B lineage surface antigen HIS24 is expressed by all surface mu chain-bearing (s mu+) B cells, by cytoplasmic mu chain-containing (c mu+s mu-) pre-B cells and TdT+ cells, and by lymphoid cells lacking both mu and TdT. Because TdT+ and HIS24+TdT-mu- cells may represent stages in B lymphocytopoiesis before mu chain expression, we investigated their kinetics. The metaphase arrest method was combined with immunofluorescence staining to detect proliferation and to quantitate cell production in the BM pre-B, TdT+, and HIS24+TdT-mu- compartments. Their apparent cell cycle times (tC(a)) were 38, 36, and 19 hr, and the number of cells produced per hour per femur were 58, 9, and 41 X 10(4), respectively. The HIS24+ compartments showed further phenotypic heterogeneity. Six percent of TdT+ cells expressed mu chains and were therefore pre-B cells. Twenty percent of HIS24+TdT-mu- cells expressed Ig other than mu chains, with size distribution and kinetics similar to HIS24+TdT-Ig- cells. Thus, the rate of production in the truly Ig-HIS24+ compartment was about 40 X 10(4)/hr/femur (8.5 by TdT+mu- and 33 by TdT-Ig-). In each phenotypic compartment, mitoses were confined to subsets of large (greater than 11 to 12 micron) cells with tC(a) of 13 to 15 hr. Surface mu+ B cells were essentially non-cycling. To quantitate whole body BM cell production, the recovery of marrow from bone and the distribution of BM were measured in 59Fe distribution experiments. The number of cells produced by whole body BM was estimated as follows: for pre-B cells, 4.5 X 10(8)/day; for TdT+mu-, 0.7 X 10(8)/day; and for HIS24+TdT-Ig- 2.6 X 10(8)/day. From the derived cell flux in these compartments we suggest that 1) many more pre-B cells are produced than needed by the peripheral B cell pool; 2) if TdT is an obligatory stage in B cell genesis, there must be at least two cell cycles in the pre-B cell compartment; 3) if it is not, the TdT+ stage may be bypassed, with HIS24+TdT-Ig- cells perhaps feeding directly into the pre-B cell compartment.\r"

A murine model is now described for analyzing the T cell immune response to Epstein-Barr virus genes expressed in murine lymphoblasts by gene transfer. In mice, a 60,000 dalton virus-encoded protein characteristically found in the plasma membrane of latently infected human lymphocytes readily induces both proliferative and cytolytic T lymphocytes specific for both the EBV protein and murine major histocompatibility proteins. Longterm cultures of L3T4+ cells, some of which were cytolytic, were found to be restricted by H-2I-Ed and the latent membrane protein. Similarly, Lyt-2+ cells were cytolytic and were restricted by H-2Ld and the lymphocyte membrane protein gene product. The similarity in murine and human effector cell responses suggests that this is a useful experimental model, and the EBV latent infection membrane protein may be an important antigen in the immune restriction of growth transformed latently infected lymphocytes.\r"

We examined the relative nominal and alloantigen-presentation capacity of each HLA class II gene product on FB by using CD4-positive, TNP-specific T cell clones restricted by determinants on DR, DQ, or DP molecules, as well as allospecific, CD4-positive T cell clones recognizing DR-, DQ-, or DP-lymphocyte activating determinants. After IFN-gamma exposure, FB strains used for antigen presentation displayed a high percentage of DR-positive cells and a much smaller percentage of DP-positive cells, but no detectable DQ-positive cells by immunofluorescent techniques. FB stimulator cells supported proliferative responses of two DR-allospecific T cell clones and one TNP-specific, DR-restricted clone, but not another TNP-specific, DR-restricted clone. Despite only modest DP expression, FB stimulated both a TNP-specific, DP-restricted clone and a DP-allospecific T cell line. However, IFN-gamma treated FB failed to stimulate a TNP-specific, DQ-restricted clone and a DQ-allospecific clone. Our data indicate that IFN-gamma differentially regulates expression of functional class II lymphocyte activating determinants on FB antigen-presenting cells and that FB may fail to support DQ-directed T cell responses due to insufficient expression of DQ molecules on the FB cell surface. However, the quantity of DR or DP expressed on FB did not directly correlate with their ability to support T cell responses, indicating that additional factors, such as differences in T cell clone activation requirements, contribute to the capacity of FB to present class II allo- and antigen-restricting epitopes.\r"

We report here that within 1 hr after interleukin 2 (IL 2) treatment of freshly isolated human LGL, IFN-gamma mRNA can be detected, with IFN-gamma protein in the culture medium within 4 to 6 hr of treatment. CD3- Leu-11+ LGL require only a single signal for IFN-gamma production because phytohemagglutinin (PHA), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), IL 2, or ionomycin can each independently induce IFN-gamma production. In addition, PHA and ionomycin (but not IL 2) show significant synergy with PMA as a stimulus to LGL. In contrast, CD3+ T cells require two stimuli for high levels of IFN-gamma production, and not only are PMA plus ionomycin or PHA synergistic, but in addition, IL 2 and PHA demonstrate some synergy. Furthermore, we have found by fractionation of peripheral blood lymphocytes that IL 2-induced IFN-gamma production is associated with the LGL population and not T cells. These results indicate that with certain stimuli, LGL may be the predominant source of IFN-gamma from peripheral blood lymphocytes.\r"

This autologous activation depends critically on the length of in vitro culture and the initial culture density, indicating that cell to cell interaction may be essential. Phenotypic characterization of cultured cells suggests that both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ T cells proliferate. However, only L3T4+ T cells produce IL 2. Mixing experiments reveal that the inability of freshly isolated lymph node cells from MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice to proliferate is not due to the presence of suppressor cells. Supernatant from 7-day cultures failed to induce freshly isolated cells to proliferate. Thus, the failure of freshly isolated cells to spontaneously proliferate and secrete IL 2 is not due to the inability of the cells to produce soluble mediators. Similar to the inactivation of normal T lymphocytes, in vitro addition of monoclonal anti-L3T4 or anti-IL 2 receptor antibody significantly inhibits the activation of these cultured lymphocytes. Spontaneous proliferation and IL 2 production can be blocked by the addition of monoclonal anti-I-Ak but not by monoclonal anti-I-Ad. Spontaneous proliferation and IL 2 production can be detected in young (4-wk-old) MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice at a time when their lymphocyte composition and physiology appear to be normal. More interestingly, spontaneous proliferation and IL 2 production cannot be detected in C57BL/6J mice bearing the lpr/lpr gene. These experiments support the notion that aberrant syngeneic autoreactivity may act as an accelerating factor in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity in MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice.\r"

Relatively small IgM+ B cells from human blood samples were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and were used as target cells. Although the interferons themselves were nonmitogenic, each enhanced the proliferative response induced by a mitogenic anti-mu monoclonal antibody, with IFN-beta usually showing the greatest enhancement and IFN-gamma the least. Pretreatment with the interferons primed resting B cells to undergo enhanced DNA synthesis in response to the anti-mu antibody DA4. Conversely, anti-mu pretreatment, followed by IFN treatment, did not induce B cells to enter the S phase. Time-course analysis revealed that IFN could augment the anti-mu response even when added as late as the final 24 hr of a 3-day culture interval. Combinations of IFN-gamma plus IFN-alpha or -beta were synergistic in the anti-mu response, whereas the IFN-alpha plus IFN-beta combination was not. The data suggest that interferons produced by both lymphocytes (IFN-gamma) and nonlymphoid inflammatory cells (IFN-alpha and -beta) can enhance B cell growth via different mechanisms.\r"

By using hapten-binding normal B cells and the B lymphoma line WEHI-279 as assays for B cell helper (maturation) factors, we have shown that Th2 clone supernatants (SN) induce differentiation to antibody secretion, whereas Th1 SN do not. The failure of Th1 SN to activate B cells is due to inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma, because it can be reversed by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody specific for IFN-gamma. Thus, in the presence of this antibody, even Th1 SN stimulate B cell maturation maximally. Conversely, recombinant IFN-gamma inhibits proliferation and differentiation of B cells induced by active Th2 SN. These results demonstrate that IFN-gamma is a potent inhibitor of B lymphocyte activation and can be distinguished from growth and maturation-inducing helper factors that are produced by both subsets of helper T cells.\r"

These mAb (A75, AM1, AM2, AM3) had equivalent reactivities with the immunizing RF during classic inhibition of antigen-binding assays. These anti-id reagents were reacting to neither other tested monoclonal IgM RF nor normal polyclonal IgM. It was possible to distinguish the id defined by the mAb from the results of four sets of experiments: dissociation of Alt RF heavy (H) and light (L) chains showed that A75, AM1, and AM2 reacted to id located on the L chain, whereas AM3 defined a conformational RF id; recombination experiments of H and L chains showed that A75 and AM2 reacted well with both homologous (Alt H + Alt L) and heterologous (Alt L + unrelated H) recombinants, whereas AM1 reacted better with the homologous recombinant than with the heterologous one; the relative affinities of the mAb were drawn from their ability to shift already bound labeled Alt RF from solid phase IgG; and radiolabeling of two mAb (A75 and AM3) and experiments of inhibition of id binding with cold anti-id and cold anti-CK showed that A75 recognized a proximal id (close to the K constant region), whereas AM3 defined a more distal id, AM2 and AM1 being located between A75- and AM3-defined sites. This topographic mapping of K light chain-associated id of a human RF with anti-id of known relative affinities could help in studying idiotypic regulation in humans.\r"

The five serologically defined subgroups, V lambda I, V lambda II, V lambda III, V lambda IV, and V lambda VI, correspond to the chemical classification that is based on sequence homologies in the first framework region (FR1). Proteins designated by sequence as lambda V react with specific anti-lambda II antisera and are thus included in the V lambda II subgroup classification. The isotypic nature of the five V lambda subgroups was evidenced through analyses of lambda-type light chains that were isolated from the IgG of normal individuals. Based on analyses of 116 Bence Jones proteins, the frequency of distribution of the lambda I, lambda II/V, lambda III, lambda IV, and lambda VI proteins in the normal lambda chain population is estimated to be 27%, 37%, 23%, 3%, and 10%, respectively. This distribution of V lambda subgroups was comparable to that found among 82 monoclonal Ig lambda proteins. Considerable V lambda intragroup antigenic heterogeneity was also apparent. At least two sub-subgroups were identified among each of the five major V lambda subgroups, implying the existence of multiple genes in the human V lambda genome. The V lambda classification of 54 Ig lambda proteins obtained from patients with primary or multiple myeloma-associated amyloidosis substantiated the preferential association of lambda VI light chains with amyloidosis AL and the predominance of the normally rare V lambda VI subgroup in this disease.\r"

HLA-B27f differs from the major B27.1 subtype in three clustered amino acid replacements: Asp74, Asp77, and Leu81 in B27.1 are changed to Tyr74, Asn77, and Ala81, respectively in B27f. This pattern of differences is analogous to that of HLA-B27.2 in that this subtype also differs from B27.1 in multiple clustered substitutions within the same segment. Thus, polymorphism within the HLA-B27 system is being achieved by introducing different sets of amino acid changes within a particular short segment of the alpha 1 domain. The most likely mechanism for the introduction of multiple changes within this segment is a nonreciprocal recombination event, such as gene conversion. The structural analogies and ethnic distribution of B27f and B27.2 as compared with those of B27.3, and B27.4 support a dynamic model of HLA-B27 evolution in which polymorphism has been created after the separation of the major ethnic groups. In this model, a Caucasian branch would be characterized by subtypes differing from B27.1 in a few changes within the alpha 1 domain, which were probably generated by single genetic steps. An Oriental branch would include those subtypes which differ from B27.1 by changes in both alpha 1 and alpha 2, involving multiple genetic steps for their generation.\r"

We observed this release both for Tac protein labeled biosynthetically and for Tac protein labeled by surface iodination of intact cells. Competitive binding studies indicated that the soluble Tac protein retained an ability to bind IL 2 with a low affinity (Kd of 11.1 nM). In addition, structural analysis revealed that the polypeptide chain began at position 1 and ended at or just before Cys-192 of the full-length molecule. Thus, the protein was missing its normal transmembrane and intracytoplasmic segments, accounting for its solubility and cellular release. The apparent lack of modification in the amino acid sequence and the termination at Cys-192 are inconsistent with a mechanism of cellular release dependent only on alternate mRNA splicing. Instead, the results suggest that proteolysis may accompany the release of soluble Tac protein from cells expressing IL 2 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Rat large granular lymphocyte (LGL) tumor cell lines were analyzed for the presence of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans in their cytolytic secretory granules. When isolated rat LGL tumor cells were incubated in vitro for 1 to 3 hr with [35S]sulfate, and the 35S-labeled macromolecules were purified by density-gradient centrifugation, they filtered on Sepharose CL-4B columns predominantly as approximately 500,000 m.w. macromolecules. After 19 hr of incubation with [35S]sulfate, however, an 85,000 m.w. species predominated. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the larger macromolecules were proteoglycans that with time were processed to glycosaminoglycan-sized macromolecules. As assessed by their susceptibility to chemical and enzymatic degradation and by high pressure liquid chromatography of the chondroitinase ABC-generated unsaturated disaccharides, the cell-associated rat LGL tumor cell proteoglycans bore almost exclusively chondroitin sulfate A glycosaminoglycans. Northern blot analysis using a gene-specific probe revealed that both normal peripheral blood and transformed rat LGL expressed the same approximately 1.3-kb mRNA that encodes the peptide core of the proteoglycans in the secretory granules of rat and mouse mast cells. In vivo radiolabeling of rat LGL tumor cells and isolation of their intact granules after nitrogen cavitation and density sedimentation established that glycosaminoglycans compartmentalized with cytolytic activity. Thus these negatively charged macromolecules may play a role in the regulation of the packaging and delivery of the cytolysins and basically charged serine proteases that have been identified in the cytolytic secretory granules of LGL.\r"

To further explore the role of Ca2+ and calmodulin (a cytoplasmic protein that mediates most of the biological effects of Ca2+) in this process, we evaluated the effects of nifedipine (a Ca2+ channel antagonist), BAY-K-8644 (a Ca2+ channel agonist), and haloperidol (an inhibitor of calmodulin) on the NK activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and the augmentation of this activity by recombinant interleukin 2 (r-IL 2) and interferon-gamma (r-gamma-IFN). We found that all of these drugs inhibit NK activity in a dose-dependent fashion. This appears to result from interference with the programming for lysis stage of the lytic process. In contrast, the presence of these agents during the incubation of PBMC with r-IL 2 or r-gamma-IFN did not induce any change in the enhancement of NK activity. These data suggest that Ca2+ exerts its effect at the intracellular level during the NK cytotoxic process, and that the augmentation of NK activity by lymphokines is independent of the calcium-calmodulin system.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages are the primary phagocytic cell of lung, but are also capable of a variety of other functions, which include initiating or modulating inflammatory and immune responses through the production of soluble mediators. One such group of mediators is the eicosanoids. Further, recent data indicate that alveolar macrophages are not functionally homogeneous, but are heterogeneous with several subpopulations that differ both morphologically and functionally. Considering the apparent importance of prostaglandin synthesis and release in inflammatory and immune responses, the current study was undertaken to determine whether alveolar macrophage subpopulations differ in their ability to synthesize and release prostaglandin (PG) E, PGI2, and thromboxane A2 after stimulation by calcium ionophore A23187, zymosan, or aggregated IgG. Alveolar macrophages were harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage and were separated into 18 density-defined fractions. Density-defined alveolar macrophages (DD-AM) showed marked heterogeneity in prostaglandin synthesis and release. Maximal PGE synthesis and release was seen as a single peak after calcium ionophore A23187 and zymosan stimulation. In contrast, two peaks in PGE synthesis were seen after aggregated IgG stimulation. PGI2 synthesis was seen as a single peak generated by different DD-AM after calcium ionophore A23187 and zymosan. In contrast, aggregated IgG stimulation of subpopulations exhibited uniform synthesis and release of PGI2. Thromboxane A2 synthesis and release was maximal from a broad range of various DD-AM after calcium ionophore A23187, zymosan, and aggregated IgG stimulation. The results demonstrate that DD-AM are heterogeneous in ability to synthesize and release prostaglandins which is dependent on the stimuli. Therefore, specific subpopulations of alveolar macrophages may be central to the control of the pulmonary inflammatory response through specific eicosanoid synthesis and release.\r"

  ".W": "The release of ornithine by macrophages and its correlation with their immunogenicity after treatment with various macrophage-stimulating substances were analyzed. Pristane-elicited peritoneal macrophages (PM) were found to express strong arginase activity and to release L-ornithine into the extracellular space. This activity is strongly reduced within 3 hr after treatment with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) but not with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Resident PM usually express little arginase activity, but this activity is markedly augmented within 24 or 48 hr after treatment with LPS. The release of ornithine by peritoneal cells (PC) (60 to 90% macrophages) was found to be correlated with their immunogenicity as determined by the in vivo immunization for a subsequent in vitro secondary cytotoxic response against minor H antigens. The immunogenicity of pristane-elicited PC is markedly stronger than that of resident PC or TPA-treated, pristane-elicited PC. Moreover, the immunogenicity of the resident PC and TPA-treated elicited PC is substantially augmented by the simultaneous injection of ornithine, whereas the immunogenicity of the untreated elicited PC is not further augmented by exogenous ornithine, indicating that the endogenous production of ornithine by the stimulating cells had a strong influence on the resulting immune response. Injection of glutathione into pristane-treated mice also reduces the ornithine production and immunogenicity of the resulting peritoneal exudate cells. The immunogenicity in this case is at least partly reconstituted by application of exogenous ornithine. Our experiments revealed no correlation between the production of ornithine and prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 production of resident and pristane-elicited PC is not markedly different and is in either case strongly augmented by TPA. Elicited or resident PM which have been incubated for several days in culture release practically no ornithine; but ornithine production can be induced again by incubation for 24 hr with LPS and to some extent also with interferon-gamma.\r"

  ".U": "87252269\r", 
  ".W": "L-Ornithine was shown to inhibit the development of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC). Lymphokines were unable to reverse the suppressive effect, and cytotoxic activity was not revealed by coupling ornithine-inhibited MLC cells to target cells with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). If addition of ornithine to MLC were delayed, sensitivity of CTL to inhibition was reduced after 24 hr and lost by 48 hr. Suppression of CTL development was not due to a toxic effect. MLC washed free of ornithine after 3 days produced detectable cytolytic activity within 24 hr of secondary culture, and to the same degree as the uninhibited MLC control within 48 hr. Cytotoxic cells generated in secondary cultures were Lyt-2+, did not kill the natural killer-sensitive YAC-1 cell line, and were shown to be antigen-specific by virtue of the findings that cytolysis and cold target inhibition were observed only with cells carrying the original, inducing H-2 haplotype. Cytolysis of target cells by normal CTL effector cells was not inhibited by L-ornithine. MLC depleted of accessory cells so that CTL activation was dependent upon addition of lymphokines remained susceptible to inhibition by ornithine. Our findings indicate that in the ornithine-inhibited MLC, CTL precursors undergo clonal expansion, but their maturation is arrested at a precytolytic stage. L-Arginine and putrescine also suppressed generation of CTL in primary MLC, and cells recovered from arginine- and putrescine-inhibited MLC developed control levels of CTL within 48 hr of secondary culture. Inhibition by putrescine was observed in tissue culture medium supplemented with human serum but not with fetal calf serum, presumably due to the presence of diamine oxidase activity in fetal calf serum. Similar to ornithine, the suppressive effects of arginine and putrescine on T lymphocytes were apparently selective for CTL because they did not inhibit mitogen activation with concanavalin A or the production of interleukin 2 and interleukin 3. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that the inhibitory effects of ornithine, arginine, and putrescine are mediated by polyamines, and exerted on the differentiative stage of CTL development.\r"

C57BL/6 mice were depleted in vivo of Lyt-1+, Lyt-2+, and L3T4+ cells by the daily administration of monoclonal antibodies. The development of protective immunity, induced by exposure to irradiated Schistosoma mansoni cercariae as expressed in depleted animals, was compared to that demonstrated in undepleted, normal, and congenitally athymic C57BL/6 mice. The development of morbidity was determined by spleen weight, portal pressure and reticuloendothelial system activity. The results indicated that depletion of specific subpopulations of T lymphocytes minimally affected the primary development of parasites; however, depletion strongly influenced the development of resistance to the parasite and subsequent morbidity due to infection. Depletion of T lymphocytes by anti-Lyt-1+ or anti-L3T4+ antibody decreased the development of resistance, antibody and delayed-type hypersensitivity directed against schistosome antigens. Morbidity due to disease was increased. Depletion of Lyt-2+ cells produced opposite changes with augmented resistance and reduced morbidity. Congenitally athymic mice developed minimal resistance and morbidity. Moreover, resistance was inversely related to the morbidity shown by a given animal. These studies indicate that the development of protective immunity to S. mansoni cercariae is regulated by discrete subpopulations of T lymphocytes. The feasibility of decreasing morbidity by increasing specific immunologically mediated resistance is suggested.\r"

  ".U": "87252272\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work using inbred, congenic and recombinant mouse strains showed a positive association with expression of E alpha and the ability of splenic cells to bind to and undergo proliferation in response to a T cell mitogen present in culture supernatants of Mycoplasma arthritidis (MAS). Studies described in the present manuscript confirm this association because lymphocytes from mice expressing H-2a, H-2d, H-2j, H-2k, H-2p, H-2u, and H-2v all of which possess E alpha responded to MAS, whereas those expressing H-2b, H-2f, H-2q, and H-2s, which lack E alpha, failed to respond. One exception was noted in that the inbred RIIIS mouse (H-2r) that expresses E alpha failed to respond to MAS but responded normally to concanavalin A, and phytohemagglutinin. In contrast, the congenic B10.RIII (H-2r) mouse did respond to MAS, suggesting the presence of an MAS nonresponsive, non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene(s) in the RIIIS mouse. MAS nonresponsiveness in the RIIIS mouse was recessive because the lymphocytes from F1 crosses with responder B10.RIII (H2r) and C3H (H2k) mice responded to MAS. Analysis of (RIIIS X B10.RIII)F1 X RIIIS or B10.RIII parental test cross progeny confirmed that nonresponsiveness to MAS was associated with a recessive, non-MHC gene(s). Evidence was also found that a non-MHC, MAS-nonresponsive gene(s) is also present in the inbred SWR (H-2q) and SJL (H-2s) strains, because lymphocytes from F1 crosses between these strains and the RIIIS mouse failed to respond to MAS. Both RIIIS and B10.RIII splenic cells bound the mitogen in MAS to a similar degree, confirming the presence of the binding site in both mice. In contrast, C3H.SW (H-2b) splenic cells that do not express E alpha failed to bind the mitogen. The nonresponsiveness of RIIIS lymphocytes to MAS was exercised at the level of the T cell rather than the accessory cell. Thus RIIIS T cells failed to respond to MAS presented by RIIIS, B10.RIII, or (RIIIS X B10.RIII)F1 accessory cells. In contrast, B10.RIII and (RIIIS X B10.RIII)F1 T cells responded to MAS when presented by RIIIS, B10.RIII, or F1 accessory cells. Similar observations were made using SWR and SJL T cells, which failed to respond to MAS irrespective of the source of accessory cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a previous series of studies, we had shown that the constitutive Ia expression in an immunoselected Ia-human B cell variant, RJ 2.2.5, could be restored by somatic cell hybridization with mouse B cells. These experiments allowed us to show the existence of a transacting activator factor(s) operating across species barriers and encoded by the aIr-1 locus located on mouse chromosome 16. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the B cell constitutive Ia expression and the inducible Ia expression, as seen in macrophages treated with IFN-gamma, are controlled by similar intracellular factors. To this purpose, we constructed an interspecies somatic cell hybrid between the human Ia-RJ 2.2.5 B cells and the mouse Ia-P388 D1 macrophage cells. These murine cells transiently express Ia antigens when incubated with IFN-gamma. Our results show that RJ 2.2.5 X P388 D1 cell hybrids do not express either human or mouse class II gene products. Treatment with human recombinant IFN-gamma did not modify the MHC phenotype of either the hybrid cells or the human parental cells. On the other hand, treatment of the hybrid cells with murine recombinant IFN-gamma resulted in de novo expression of mouse Ia mRNA and corresponding cell surface antigens without, however, reinduction of the human class II-positive phenotype. Furthermore, treatment with the mouse lymphokine significantly increased the levels of human HLA class I mRNA and corresponding cell surface antigens in the hybrid cells, further reinforcing the notion of the existence of non-species-specific secondary mediators generated after receptor-ligand interaction in the IFN-gamma system. Together, these results indicate that in macrophages, the intracellular events taking place after binding of IFN-gamma with its own receptor and leading to the expression of a class II-positive phenotype do not operate via an activation of the aIr-1 locus and/or its products. Thus, at least in our experimental system, we can firmly establish a first, relevant distinction between constitutive and inducible class II gene expression. This difference, dictated by the specific differentiation program of each cell type, may be relevant for the understanding of the function of class II gene products.\r"

All of these agents also caused rapid and transient changes in c-fos gene expression, either enhancement (CT, dex, and LPS) or decrease (IFN-gamma and Con A). Moreover, inhibition of protein synthesis elicited a transient increase in the level of c-fos gene transcription, suggesting that the transcriptional activity of the c-fos gene is controlled by labile protein repressor(s).

  ".W": "The resistance of target cells to the cytolytic action of lymphotoxin (LT) and recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) has been investigated by using clonally derived cell lines with defined gap junction-mediated, intercellular communication properties. Gap junction-competent Chinese hamster ovary cells are normally insensitive to the action of LT/TNF. However, treatment with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which promotes the loss of gap junctions, or culturing at low cell density to reduce intercellular contacts, significantly increased their sensitivity to LT/TNF. The LT/TNF-sensitive murine CL-1D and L929 cell lines, which in normal culture conditions are unable to form gap junctions, were not changed in their susceptibility to LT/TNF after treatment with phorbol ester or low culture density. However, the formation of gap junctions by CL-1D can be promoted by treatment with 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (1 mM), and this treatment completely suppressed the ability of LT and rTNF to kill CL-1D. Additionally, the LA25-normal rat kidney cell line, which is infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (LA25), is gap junction-competent and resistant to the effects of LT at the restrictive temperature (39 degrees C). However, when shifted to the permissive temperature (33 degrees C), LA25-normal rat kidney cells express the pp60v-src viral gene product, lose their ability to form gap junctions, and become sensitive to the lytic activity of LT. The results demonstrate that the expression of the retroviral pp60v-src, a tyrosine protein kinase, is sufficient to render cells susceptible to the lytic effects of LT and rTNF. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between the resistance of target cells to the action of LT/TNF and their ability to cooperate metabolically through gap junctions. The results do not completely exclude the possibility that other mechanisms, such as LT receptor modulation, are also occurring under these experimental conditions. These data also suggest that a possible physiologic function of the stable cytotoxic lymphokines is to induce cytolysis/cytostasis of cells that have lost gap junctional contact, such as those in the process of mitosis or metastasis that have separated from the main tissue mass.\r"

  ".U": "87252346\r", 
  ".W": "A large number of cross-linked envelopes form spontaneously when cell lines derived from chemically induced mouse skin papillomas are cultured in medium containing 1.2 mM calcium. This phenomenon is associated with high activity of the cross-linking enzyme, epidermal transglutaminase (TGase). The influence of retinoic acid (RA) on envelope formation was studied in detail in a papilloma cell line, PE. Retinoic acid (3 microM) completely blocked cornified envelope (CE) production but reduced TGase activity only 50%. A rabbit antiserum was produced against sonicated CEs isolated from newborn mouse skin. On Western blots of epidermal extracts, diffuse staining was observed for particulate proteins of suprabasal, but not basal, cells and similar immunoreactive material was absent from the cytosolic fraction of both cell layers. The antibody also recognized particulate proteins from PE cells induced to differentiate by calcium, but not from cells grown in the presence of high calcium and RA. The antiserum appears to recognize partially cross-linked CE precursor proteins judging by the diffuse staining, the molecular weight range of the proteins stained, and their origin in the particulate cellular fraction. Cross-linked envelopes could be induced in RA-treated PE cells by permeabilization with 0.75 M NaCl or 50 micrograms/ml A23187. However, this treatment failed to cause the appearance of proteins recognized by the antiserum. Preincubation of the antiserum with purified fragments of CEs from newborn mouse epidermis, but not with cross-linked envelopes from permeabilized, RA-treated PE cells, removed immunoreactivity. These results indicate that the cross-linked envelopes formed in RA-treated cells after permeabilization lack a set of proteins contained in CEs from stratum corneum and may even be composed of different proteins. Retinoic acid appears to prevent CE formation in part by inhibiting activation of epidermal TGase but in addition by influencing the synthesis of precursor proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Significant levels of intracellular catecholamines were found in a human melanoma cell line and were enhanced by increasing the extracellular tyrosine concentration. Intracellular dopa, 5-cysteinyldopa, tyrosinase, and melanin also rose under these conditions. 5-HT (serotonin) was synthesized by the melanoma cells but further study was hindered by the high level of 5-HT in fetal calf serum. A 5-HT uptake antagonist, DU 24565 (6-nitroquipazine), was employed as an alternative method for studying 5-HT action. This compound, which in contrast to tunicamycin had no inhibitory effects on cell proliferation or tyrosinase activity, strongly inhibited melanization and decreased the levels of dopa, 5-cysteinyldopa, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. DU 24565 had little effect on 5-HT or tyrosine accumulation in these cells but suppressed the uptake of extracellular dopa. The results show that human melanoma cells synthesize a wide range of biogenic amines in culture and suggest a new approach to regulating intracellular levels of dopa and of a variety of dopa products.\r"

Recombinant gamma interferon (r-IFN-gamma) was radioiodinated using the Bolton-Hunter reagent and retained 90% of its biologic activity as determined by induction of HLA-DR expression. The biochemical ligand-binding properties of iodinated IFN-gamma to cultured human keratinocytes revealed a plateau of binding at 150 min at 4 degrees C, and a single class of specific high affinity receptors (kD = 1.3 X 10(-10) M; 2200 sites/cell). The binding of human IFN-gamma, to keratinocytes was inhibited by human r-IFN-gamma, but not by either murine recombinant gamma interferon or human recombinant beta interferon (r-IFN-beta). The presence of high affinity receptor sites on human keratinocytes assures the reception of appropriate immunologic signals in lymphocyte-keratinocyte interactions.\r"

The viability of the cell types was measured in a microassay using histoplates. IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta, when employed singly, demonstrated an equivalent and limited effect on the viability of all cell lines. Treatment of nontumorigenic and nonpromotable cell lines with the combination of IFN-gamma + IFN-alpha/beta also caused only a limited effect on cell viability, whereas treatment of tumorigenic and promotable cell lines with the combination of IFNs caused a marked decrease in cell viability. Thus, the cytolytic effect of IFNs employed in combination but not singly was discriminatory between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells as well as between promotable and nonpromotable cells. Addition of cytotoxic effector cells was found to have a relatively moderate effect on the survival of target cells that were treated with IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha/beta separately. Addition of cytotoxic effectors to target cells treated with the IFNs in combination had a discriminatory effect. Nontumorigenic and nonpromotable cells were moderately affected; the tumorigenic and the promotable cells, however, were markedly affected, resulting in their complete (or nearly complete) eradication. The results demonstrate that combination IFN treatment: has a discriminatory cytolytic effect on tumorigenic and promotable cells in contrast to their nontumorigenic and nonpromotable counterparts; and when added to cytotoxic effector cells can completely eradicate tumorigenic and promotable cells while having a significantly lesser effect on nontumorigenic and nonpromotable cells.\r"

This phenomenon is at least partly due to receptor-mediated endocytosis involving coated pits, coated vesicles, endosomes, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes. These ultrastructural results suggest that T6 antigen may be part of a receptor site. Following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the appearance in the cell center of the first labeled Birbeck granules suggests that Birbeck granules could represent T6 intracellular transport organelles carrying T6 from the central part of the cell to an unknown destination.\r"

To seek evidence for a local defect in mucosal immunity, we assessed the presence of epithelial Langerhans cells (LC) in these lesions and in autologous nonlesional mucosa. We used monoclonal antibodies against HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and T6 antigens to identify LC in biopsy specimens of HL from 23 homosexual men. In all lesion specimens, LC either were not detected or were present only in greatly reduced numbers with at least 1 of the antibodies. In nonlesional oral mucosa from the same patients, LC were detected with all 3 antibodies in 11/12 specimens (92%) and were found in approximately normal numbers with at least 1 antibody. There was close correlation between the absence of LC and positive staining for EBV, human papillomavirus antigens, and candidal hyphae in the epithelium. We conclude that LC are absent or greatly reduced in the lesions of HL. Absence of normal LC function may be important in the pathogenesis of HL and may reflect an event in the pathogenesis of other features of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\r"

Ninety-one +/- two percent of all inflammatory mononuclear cells in situ were T11-positive T lymphocytes, whereas B lymphocytes were few. Forty-nine +/- nine percent of cells were Ia-positive, suggesting involvement of T cells in the local pathogenetic mechanisms, but interleukin-2 receptor-carrying cells as well as [3H]thymidine-incorporating cells accounted for less than 2% of all inflammatory cells, suggesting that T blasts account for only a small minority. Similarly, PCA-1 plasma cells were few in situ, there was no immunoglobulin or complement deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction and serum antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies as well as complement levels were normal, and no visceral involvement was revealed during the survey period. According to our findings, JLI of the skin seems to be sufficiently distinctive to be appreciated as an entity. T lymphocytes in JLI do not seem to proliferate in the site of inflammation but are merely accumulated from the circulation.\r"

Bactericidal reactions mediated via the classic complement pathway (unchelated system) were not impaired in properdin-deficient serum. The properdin-deficient sera supported alternative pathway-mediated killing (Mg++EGTA-chelated system) of some, but not all, of the strains investigated. Vaccination of the properdin-deficient individuals with serogroup A and C polysaccharide clearly increased the concentrations of antibody to meningococci. At least some of the antibodies induced by vaccination supported the bactericidal activity of properdin-deficient serum. Some antibodies to meningococci, probably of the IgM class, promoted alternative pathway-mediated bactericidal reactions in the absence of properdin. By contrast, presensitizing meningococci with IgG enhanced the alternative pathway-mediated reactions, but this was strictly a properdin-dependent effect.\r"

Stool samples from treated infants showed the presence of bovine milk immunoglobulins in 47% of cases and of neutralizing activity in 43% (mean neutralization titer, 1:48); stool samples from control infants showed neutralizing activities in only 3% of cases (neutralization titers, less than 1:20). Immunoelectrophoresis of stool extracts revealed fragment A, a bovine analogue of F(ab')2 or Fab, as the major product of in vitro and in vivo digestion of the immunoglobulins. Cessation of excretion of virus correlated with the appearance of neutralizing activities in 19 of 25 infants. Only concentrate-treated infants with high neutralizing activity in stools showed a statistically significant reduction in duration of excretion of virus; this duration in concentrate-treated infants with low neutralizing activity was comparable with controls.\r"

Failure to receive a second injection of either 5 or 10 ml of ISG permitted an occurrence of hepatitis that was not significantly different from that among subjects who failed to receive a second placebo injection.

Here we demonstrate the importance of the activation state of murine macrophages for both fungistatic and fungicidal activity.

This activated state may be aided by antifungal agents such as amphotericin B. Both a methyl ester derivative of amphotericin B and liposomal amphotericin B Both a methyl ester derivative of amphotericin B and liposomal amphotericin B potentiated macrophage activation but were less potent than amphotericin B. Other available antifungal agents such as azole compounds and flucytosine did not possess this ability to interact with the intrinsic macrophage effector mechanisms. However, ketoconazole and itraconazole avidly bind to macrophages as the biologically active drug. The azole-loading of macrophages may be a factor in macrophage cytotoxicity for fungi.\r"

Hypertensive Dahl S rats receiving a high (8%) NaCl diet for 12 weeks, and rats with anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis, both of which had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) less than half those of respective control rats, exhibited similar relative increases In GFR and ERPF in response to atriopeptin III as did controls. Natriuresis, diuresis, and decreased blood pressure were as prominent in rats with either form of renal disease as in control rats. Rats receiving high NaCl intake, irrespective of renal function, had relatively exaggerated responses compared with rats receiving a normal NaCl diet. We conclude that rats with chronic renal insufficiency of diverse causes respond briskly to ANF despite presumed hyperperfused and hyperfiltering nephrons. Thus, diseased kidneys exhibit substantial renal functional \"reserve.\" The renal response to ANF appears to be influenced by NaCl intake in both normal animals and those with renal insufficiency.\r"

The data indicate that bleomycin-mediated injury to cultured BPAE cells can be quantified by 51Cr release, expressed as cytotoxic index (CI). Bleomycin-mediated injury to 51Cr-labeled BPAE cells (CI 19.4 +/- 1.6) could be significantly reduced by the iron chelator deferoxamine, 10(-3) mol/L (CI 7.5 +/- 1.1, P less than 0.001), but not by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 10(-5) mol/L (CI 19.8 +/- 2.2). Similarly, bleomycin-mediated injury to BPAE cells (monitored by lactate dehydrogenase release) with a CI 27.1 +/- 4.8 could be reduced by 10(-3) mol/L deferoxamine to CI 10.5 +/- 2.6 (P less than 0.01). In contrast, hyperoxia (95% O2) accelerated bleomycin (1 to 100 mU/ml) toxicity to BPAE cells (P less than 0.01, all comparisons). This study suggests that bleomycin-induced injury of pulmonary endothelial cells may be dependent in part on two critical factors in the cellular environment: the availability of iron to the cell and the ambient O2 concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Because the presence of carbonic anhydrase C (CA C) has been demonstrated in the oligodendrocytes of the mouse, rat and man, anti-CA C serum has been considered to be a possible specific marker for these cells. In order to determine its value in human neurooncology, specimens from 110 human tumors from the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as from five cases of cerebral infarction and two of multiple sclerosis were tested immunohistochemically by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with anti-CA C serum. Reactive astrocytes, oligodendrocytes in the neural parenchyma surrounding tumors, and neurons included in areas of neoplasia showed CA C immunopositivity. In 92% of the astrocytomas and 56% of the glioblastomas variable numbers of tumor cells were positive. Some tumor cells positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein in ependymomas and astroblastomas were also CA C-positive. Schwannomas (86%), neurofibromas (100%) and meningiomas (86%) showed CA C positivity of the tumor cells, as did choroid plexus papillomas and gangliogliomas. However, all the medulloblastomas, neuroblastomas, central neurocytomas or melanomas tested in this study were entirely CA C-negative. In some examples of squamous cell carcinoma, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma and fibrous histiocytoma, CA C-positive neoplastic cells were also demonstrated. Our findings indicate that since various types of neoplastic and reactive cells express CA C positivity, the anti-CA C serum cannot be used as a specific marker for any tumor in human neurooncology.\r"

Intravenous nutrition (TPN) is often required after head injury due to intolerance to enteral feeding (EN). This study evaluates the effect of TPN on intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements in severely brain-injured patients. Ninety-six severely brain-injured patients were randomly assigned to receive TPN or EN and were studied from hospital admission until 18 days postinjury. The TPN was started within 48 hours postinjury and the EN was started when tolerated. Peak daily ICP was not significantly different on admission and over time (overall mean +/- standard error of the mean 32.01 +/- 1.62 for TPN versus 32.5 +/- 1.25 for EN). Intracranial pressure was greater than 20 mm Hg in 75% of TPN patients and 73% of EN patients. Conventional therapy failed to control elevated ICP in 36% of TPN patients and 38% of EN patients. Of these patients, subsequent barbiturate therapy failed to control ICP in 56% of TPN patients and 64% of EN patients. Serum osmolality was not significantly different between groups at admission or over the course of the study. The TPN group tended to have higher mean serum glucose levels for the first 13 days postinjury, while the EN group had a higher mean serum glucose content thereafter, but these differences were not statistically significant. This study shows that TPN can be given safely to the severely brain-injured patient without causing serum hyperosmolality or affecting ICP levels or ICP therapy.\r"

This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that carnitine biosynthesis in the human infant is regulated by substrate availability rather than activity of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, the final enzyme in the carnitine biosynthetic pathway. Ten infants were fed carnitine-free formula supplemented with either 500 microM epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine or 500 microM gamma-butyrobetaine for 14 d. Plasma carnitine concentration and rate of urinary carnitine excretion were measured in infants before and after this period. Plasma carnitine concentration increased twofold when infants were fed either epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine and increased threefold when infants were fed gamma-butyrobetaine. The rate of carnitine excretion doubled when infants were fed epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine and increased 30-fold when infants were fed gamma-butyrobetaine. Absorption of epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine was verified by demonstrating increased urinary excretion of epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine in infants fed this substrate. We conclude that gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase activity is not rate limiting for carnitine biosynthesis in the human infant. Development of renal and hepatic gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase activity was determined in necropsy tissue from individuals of various ages. It was verified that gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase activity is developmentally regulated in the liver, but not in the kidney. The clinical relevance of this observation is diminished in view of the results of the in vivo studies of carnitine biosynthesis in infants.\r"

The OD rat is a rat mutant unable to synthesize ascorbic acid. In OD rats, the dietary requirement of ascorbic acid to maintain normal growth and normal levels of cholesterol in serum and liver is about 300 mg of ascorbic acid/kg diet. In control (ODS-+/+) rats that can synthesize ascorbic acid, dietary addition of 0.5% cholesterol and 0.25% cholic acid caused elevation of cholesterol concentrations in serum and liver, elevation of total lipids in liver and reduction of the ratio of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum. Dietary addition of PCB (200 mg/kg diet) caused elevation of serum concentration of cholesterol and of the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum. In OD rats fed a normal diet, ascorbic acid deficiency slightly elevated serum concentration of cholesterol, elevated liver concentration of cholesterol and reduced the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum; and ascorbic acid excess did not affect serum and liver concentrations of cholesterol and the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum. In OD rats fed a cholesterol-containing diet, ascorbic acid deficiency elevated serum and liver concentrations of cholesterol, and did not affect the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum; and ascorbic acid excess did not affect serum and liver concentrations of cholesterol and the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol in serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the relation between blood flow and mean airway pressure in two groups of anesthetized newborn piglets. The first group had normal respiratory compliance; the second group had pulmonary surfactant depleted by repeated saline lavage, which decreased static respiratory compliance by 42%. In the normal group, cardiac output decreased linearly from 292 +/- 43 mL/min/kg at 5 cm H2O airway pressure to 134 +/- 37 ml/min/kg at 20 cm H2O airway pressure, a drop of 43% (r2 = 0.79). Blood flow to the heart, kidney, and intestines had a similar decline, but brain, hepatic artery, and adrenal flow were constant. Mean arterial blood pressure did not decrease significantly until the highest airway pressure was reached, whereas sagittal sinus pressure increased as mean airway pressure increased. In contrast, the surfactant-depleted group maintained cardiac output up to a mean airway pressure of 15 cm H2O. At 20 cm H2O, cardiac output fell to 40% of the original value. Blood flow to the heart and kidneys fell at a mean airway pressure of 20 cm H2O; intestinal blood flow decreased beginning at 10 cm H2O. As in the normal piglets, brain, hepatic arterial, and adrenal blood flow were not affected by increasing ventilation pressure. Our data show that positive pressure ventilation in the neonate has important cardiovascular effects that are blunted when respiratory compliance is decreased. More important, because cardiac output decreased prior to a significant decline in arterial blood pressure, these data suggest that in a clinical setting considerable cardiovascular alterations can occur before a decline in arterial blood pressure is detected.\r"

Increasing tidal volume augmented CO2 elimination (P less than 0.01 to 0.001) at each frequency, but when larger tidal volumes were associated with high inadvertent PEEP, CO2 elimination decreased despite the increase in minute ventilation. For constant minute ventilation, CO2 elimination decreased with increasing frequencies. Occurrence of inadvertent PEEP was related to increases in both frequency and tidal volume. If PEEP was controlled, no decrease in CO2 elimination was observed at the larger tidal volume. When PEEP was controlled, changes in tidal volume explained 67.1% to 95.4% of the variance in CO2 elimination not attributable to frequency. Frequency explained very little additional variance (0.1% to 13.8%). CO2 elimination comparable to estimated CO2 production occurred when tidal volumes equal to or smaller than the equipment dead space were used. We conclude that although tidal volume has a greater effect than frequency on CO2 elimination, mechanisms of gas exchange other than bulk gas transport occur during high-frequency jet ventilation.\r"

Results were compared with changes in body weight, fluid and sodium intake, urine output, and serum sodium concentration. Mean +/- SD ECV decreased from 550 +/- 116 mL/kg on day 1 to 359 +/- 66 mL/kg on day 14. Thereafter, mean ECV/kg remained between 336 +/- 42 and 349 +/- 54 mL/kg. Clinical hydration and serum sodium concentration usually remained normal during this reduction of stabilization of ECV/kg. Six episodes of hyponatremia occurred at 11 to 31 days of age. Mean ECV/kg was significantly lower in infants with hyponatremia compared with infants of similar age with normal serum sodium concentration (303 +/- 36 mL/kg vs 368 +/- 56 mL/kg, P less than 0.01). Sodium intake in the two groups was similar. We conclude that ECV in the VLBW infant decreases postnatally and is regulated within a range similar to that in older infants, and that postnatal natriuresis in the first 2 weeks of life represents physiologic reduction of the expanded ECV of the fetus. Late hyponatremia may indicate excessive sodium loss and ECV depletion.\r"

The geometric mean anti-type b antibody concentration before reimmunization was 0.68 micrograms/mL, and rose to 31 micrograms/mL in sera obtained 1 month later. The mean level after immunization was not significantly different than that in sera from 12 adults immunized with type b polysaccharide vaccine (51 micrograms/mL, P = 0.3), and was 10-fold higher than that of 13 control children immunized with type b polysaccharide for the first time (2.7 micrograms/mL, P less than 0.001). The IgG responses of the children first given conjugate vaccine and then conventional type b polysaccharide vaccine were of a similar magnitude as those in the immunized adults. Further, the children maintained high levels of serum antibody 6 to 8 months later. Ten other children vaccinated in infancy with conjugate vaccine, and again with conjugate vaccine 10 to 15 months later, showed similar antibody responses to those of the group given conjugate vaccine in infancy, and booster with conventional polysaccharide vaccine. Thus vaccination with H. influenzae type b polysaccharide-outer membrane protein conjugate vaccine primes the immune system to an IgG memory antibody response to either type b polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine. Post-booster sera from all children tested showed high titers of functional activity in a complement-mediated bactericidal assay. These data suggest that protection of most infants from type b Haemophilus disease may be achieved by a combination of immunization at 2 to 4 months of age with this conjugate vaccine, and reimmunization 1 year later with conjugate or conventional type b polysaccharide vaccine.\r"

High inspiratory flow rates were associated with high peak plasma concentrations and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve. A 10-sec breath hold at the end of inspiration did not alter significantly the plasma concentration-time curve. Instillation of SCG (1 mg) directly into a second-order bronchus of 14 patients undergoing diagnostic examination gave plasma concentration-time curves similar to those seen in normal volunteers at high inspiratory flow rates. Additional studies in normal volunteers showed that SCG was poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The shorter terminal half-life seen after i.v. infusion compared with inhalation indicates that the drug shows absorption rate limited disposition kinetics after inhalation. These studies in large numbers of subjects support the conclusions of limited earlier investigations that SCG is absorbed slowly but almost completely from the airways, that there is little gastrointestinal absorption of SCG, that only a small proportion of the Spinhaler dose (about 10%) reaches the airways and that the amount reaching the airways is related directly to inspiratory flow rate.\r"

Verapamil in a dose of 10 micrograms/kg dilated the large epicardial coronary artery, increased the coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased the aortic pressure. A reduction of left ventricular dP/dt was observed when over 30 micrograms/kg of verapamil was administered. Nitroglycerin in a dose of 0.01 micrograms/kg dilated the large epicardial coronary artery. Other variables such as coronary blood flow, aortic pressure and heart rate were influenced when over 0.1 micrograms/kg of nitroglycerin was given. The effects of these drugs on coronary and systemic hemodynamics were augmented when incremental doses were given. Duration of the increases in coronary diameter and coronary blood flow persisted longer after verapamil than after nitroglycerin. To estimate the changes in coronary diameter, independent of flow change, the effects of verapamil (100 micrograms/kg) and nitroglycerin (20 micrograms/kg) on the large epicardial coronary artery were reexamined when the coronary blood flow was maintained constant using a cuff occluder. The extent of coronary artery dilation, unaffected by coronary blood flow, was 62% with verapamil and 100% with nitroglycerin. Thus, although nitroglycerin preferentially and flow-independently dilates the large epicardial coronary artery, dilation of the large epicardial coronary artery after verapamil is augmented by the process of flow-induced arterial relaxation.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that striatal dopamine regulates enkephalin (ENK) synthesis is supported by the increase of striatal proenkephalin mRNA and ENK after intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. In order to elucidate which dopamine receptor subtype is operative in the regulation of the dynamic state of ENK, the effect of drugs that block D-1 or D-2 receptor selectively was studied. Daily administration of 140 mumol/kg s.c. of the D-2 antagonist I-sulpiride twice daily for 2 weeks produces a 30% decrease in the content of striatal proenkephalin mRNA and ENK. In contrast, a 50% increase was observed after 2 weeks of treatment with the D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 at 74 nmol/kg s.c. three times a day. Hence, it can be inferred that the endogenous activation of D-1 tonically decreases striatal ENK synthesis. Removal of this neurally mediated regulation either by a specific pharmacologic blockage of D-1 or by lesioning with 6-hydroxydopamine increases the biosynthesis of ENK. The increase of ENK biosynthesis elicited by denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine cannot be due to the endogenous activation of D-2 receptors and must be due to the inactivation of the tonic inhibition exerted by D-1 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to investigate antigen-induced peptidoleukotriene release from lungs of sensitized guinea pigs using a recently developed solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography assay system. This release was compared to the response due to Ca++-ionophore (A23187) challenge. Incubation of lung fragments (0.6 g) from actively sensitized guinea pigs with ovalbumin (3 micrograms/ml) for 20 min at 37 degrees C resulted in the release of 40 to 60 ng of leukotriene (LT)D4 detected in the extracted filtrate (40-50% recovery of LTD4). The amount of LTD4 determined using the high-performance liquid chromatography assay correlated well with the quantity determined by a LTC4 radioimmunoassay. LTD4 release was saturable and was optimal at a tissue concentration of 0.6 g/2.5 ml of buffer. Kinetic analysis of LT generation showed that after antigen challenge, LTC4 levels peaked at 3 min and declined rapidly with time; LTD4 levels then increased significantly, reaching a maximum at 15 min and decreased slightly at 60 min. LTE4 was not detected until 30 min after antigen challenge after which it increased slowly. The kinetic results permit an estimation of the rate of LTD4 and LTE4 formation to be 5 and 0.17 ng/min/g of lung, respectively. In contrast to antigen challenge, LTD4 release from Ca++-ionophore-stimulated lung fragments was not saturable and was biphasic with increasing amounts of tissues. Moreover, LTD4 produced by Ca++-ionophore stimulation could not be detected during the first 10 min but thereafter increased linearly with incubation time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Isolated rabbit hearts were perfused with salt solution containing autologous 111In-labeled neutrophils to determine whether 1) hypoxia provoked myocardial neutrophil sequestration, 2) neutrophil accumulation could be suppressed by inhibition of lipoxygenase and 3) hypoxic myocardium generated radioimmunoassayable leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Whereas accumulation of 111In-labeled neutrophils by normoxic hearts was minimal, induction of acute myocardial hypoxia by perfusion with hypoxic medium caused a rapid uptake of 111In-labeled neutrophils. Sequestered neutrophils were not released during a subsequent 20-min normoxic perfusion period. Hypoxia-induced neutrophil uptake was prevented by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) or diethylcarbamazine (DEC), two structurally different inhibitors of lipoxygenase. Although no radioimmunoassayable LTB4 could be detected in neutrophil-free perfusate from normoxic or hypoxic preparations, hypoxia caused an approximate 2-fold increase in myocardial tissue levels of LTB4. Tissue levels of LTB4 reverted to control values after 20 min of normoxic perfusion. Infusion of exogenous LTB4 also provoked myocardial neutrophil uptake. Viewed collectively, these observations suggest that in isolated buffer-perfused rabbit hearts hypoxia induces LTB4 release from resident myocardial cells, which promotes avid neutrophil sequestration.\r"

When drugs used therapeutically as anorectics were tested, they consistently produced greater than 80% of AMPH-appropriate responding. The order of potency for substituting for AMPH was: mazindol greater than AMPH = phenmetrazine = phentermine greater than chlorphentermine = phendimetrazine = diethylpropion greater than clortermine = mefenorex. Other anorectics such as phenylpropanolamine (0.3-30.0 mg/kg) and fenfluramine (1.0-17.0 mg/kg) only substituted partially for AMPH whereas benzphetamine (1.0-100.0 mg/kg) resulted primarily in saline-appropriate responding. Compounds related to AMPH in biochemical mechanism of action or psychomotor stimulant activity also were tested. Methylphenidate (0.1-3.0 mg/kg), piribedil (0.3-17.0 mg/kg) and nisoxetine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH whereas bupropion (1.0-30.0 mg/kg) and propylhexedrine (10.0-100.0 mg/kg) substituted for AMPH in two of three pigeons tested. In contrast, caffeine and fenetylline resulted principally in saline-appropriate responding. Compounds from pharmacological classes not related to AMPH, such as morphine, diazepam and phencyclidine, failed to substitute for AMPH. In general, compounds with anorectic and/or stimulant properties shared discriminative stimulus properties with AMPH.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of vasodilators with varying mechanisms of action on pressor responses mediated by alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors was investigated in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. After ganglionic, cholinergic and beta adrenergic blockade, equipressor doses of phenylephrine (0.6 microgram/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, and B-HT 933 (20 micrograms/kg i.v.) a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, were administered before and in the presence of infusions of nifedipine (0.25-2.0 micrograms/kg/min), nicorandil (4.0-32.0 micrograms/kg/min) or nitroglycerin (1.0-8.0 micrograms/kg/min). Nifedipine produced a dose-related attenuation of the increase in mean arterial pressure after bolus administration of phenylephrine (from 26 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 1 mm Hg) and B-HT 933 (from 29 +/- 2 to 5 +/- 1 mm Hg). Nicorandil did not affect phenylephrine-mediated pressor responses but significantly attenuated those to B-HT 933 (28 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 1 mm Hg). In contrast, nitroglycerin had no effect on either phenylephrine or B-HT 933-mediated responses. In additional experiments after autonomic nervous system blockade, multiple doses of phenylephrine (0.6, 1.25 and 2.5 micrograms/kg i.v.) and B-HT 933 (10, 20 and 40 micrograms/kg i.v.) were administered before and after i.v. infusions of nifedipine (1.0 microgram/kg/min) or nicorandil (16.0 micrograms/kg/min). Nifedipine significantly decreased the pressor responses to all doses of phenylephrine and B-HT 933. In contrast, the attenuation from control of alpha-2-mediated increases in arterial pressure by nicorandil was partially overcome at higher doses (40 micrograms/kg) of B-HT 933.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87253912\r", 
  ".W": "Alpha-1 adrenoceptors were identified in the chick expansor secundariorum (ESM) smooth muscle by ligand binding (using [3H]prazosin) and organ bath techniques. We examined the effects of both reversible (6-hydroxydopamine-induced) and irreversible (surgical) noradrenergic denervation on alpha-1 adrenoceptors in the ESM. We also measured, in vitro, muscle contraction stimulated by the alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine and by 5-hydroxytryptamine. After both surgical and chemical denervation there were decreases in the number of [3H] prazosin binding sites in the ESM. After reversible denervation the decrease in receptor number persisted during a period in which there was extensive reinnervation of the muscle. At a time (7 days after injection) when the ESM was partially reinnervated the maximum methoxamine-stimulated response, but not that of 5-hydroxytryptamine, was reduced. After surgical (but not chemical) denervation there were increases in both protein content and wet weight of the muscle. However, at 7 days after denervation, these effects alone could not account for the observed decrease in receptor number. A small increase in sensitivity (1.4-fold) to methoxamine and a much larger increase in sensitivity (4.5-fold) to 5-hydroxytryptamine developed after surgical denervation but there appeared to be nonspecific decreases in maximum responses to the agonists. It is concluded that both surgical and chemical denervation produced a decrease in alpha-1 adrenoceptor number in the ESM; this may have contributed to the decrease in maximum contractile response. After surgical denervation a nonspecific supersensitivity developed in the ESM; it may be that a nonspecific contribution to methoxamine-stimulated responses was less apparent due to the loss of alpha-1 adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Role of endogenous histamine in postanaphylactic phase of allergic inflammation was examined by using a rat model of allergic inflammation of air pouch type. Histamine in the exudate revealed a biphasic increase. The anaphylactic increase was followed by rapid decrease and then by a gradual rising in postanaphylactic phase with the maximum attained around 24 hr after the antigenic challenge. It again decreased gradually. The histamine increase in the postanaphylactic phase was accompanied by the increase of histidine decarboxylase activity in inflammatory tissues. Local administration of pyrilamine, an H1 antagonist, together with either methysergide, a serotonin antagonist, or cimetidine, an H2 antagonist, was unable to inhibit vascular permeability response in the postanaphylactic phase. When histaminase was administered locally in the postanaphylactic phase to reduce histamine in the exudate, neutrophil accumulation in the exudate was enhanced without any change in exudate accumulation. Enhancement of the neutrophil accumulation was also inducible with local administration of cimetidine but not with pyrilamine. Local administration of histamine inhibited the neutrophil accumulation dose-dependently. These results suggest that endogenous histamine released in the postanaphylactic phase contributes to downward regulation of neutrophil accumulation in the inflammatory site without affecting the vascular permeability.\r"

This solution caused platelet aggregation and on transmission electron microscopy, dense gold containing particles measuring 125 nm are seen. Within 10 min of onset of dissolution, no gold containing particulate matter was detectable on electron microscopy. By 20 min, fibrillar particles measuring 40-150 nm appear. These resembled in general morphology and element composition the particles seen within aurosomes in platelets treated with Myochrysine (GSTM) and in synovium and other tissues by other workers. Our data elaborate on previous physical and chemical studies and correlate with morphological variations of gold containing particles at different phases. These variations in GSTM may be due to polymer size and/or structural change within the polymer. The biochemical significance of our data should provide better understanding of the biological effects of these gold thiol compounds in vivo.\r"

The use of vesicostomy in the newborn period rather than transurethral fulguration prevented the potential complications of urethral stricture and inadequate valve resection that can occur owing to the small size of the neonatal urethra. Furthermore, a period of vesicostomy drainage before eventual ureteral reimplantation for severe vesicoureteral reflux obviated the need for ureteral tailoring.\r"

Assays for 12 vitamins were performed both before and after a standard 10-day course of TPN. Patients were given nothing by mouth. The first 25 patients received a daily parenteral vitamin mixture tailored to the recommendations of the Nutrition Advisory Group of The American Medical Association (maintenance dose). The final 10 patients were given a parenteral multivitamin dose providing substantially greater amounts of most vitamins (repletion dose). Only 58% (190/324) of pre-TPN vitamin levels were normal, 25% were low, and 17% were high. No patient had fewer than two abnormal baseline levels. Vitamin levels did not correlate with serum albumin, body weight, or nitrogen balance. After 10 days of treatment, only 39% of low pre-TPN vitamin levels improved; most (45/62) of the low posttreatment levels were low at baseline. The higher repletion dose resulted in a significantly (p less than 0.01) greater percent increase in vitamin A, C, and pyridoxine levels. The prevalence of abnormal vitamin levels in this population is high (42%). Standard parenteral vitamin therapy leads to marginal improvement in abnormally low pre-TPN vitamin levels.\r"

However, this may lead to chemical interactions and reduce the amount of active vitamins and trace elements made available to the patient. We have studied the effects on micronutrient status of provision of all nutrients in one 3-liter bag (CNM: amino acids, dextrose, Intralipid 20%, a nine-element trace metal mixture, and complete fat- and water-soluble vitamin mixtures) in 10 postoperative surgical patients [median intravenous nutrition (IVN) 14.5 days, range 7-38]. A similar group received the fat emulsion plus water- and fat-soluble vitamins as a separate infusion (SI) from a 3-liter bag (median IVN 14.0 days, range 8-28). Serum and urine magnesium, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, and selenium, serum vitamins A, E, C, folate, and B12, RBC B1, B2 B6, and folate and leukocyte vitamin C were measured at weekly intervals. All patients in both groups maintained or improved their status for all the micronutrients analyzed. No significant differences between the CNM and SI groups were found in blood concentrations of any of the elements or vitamins. Only for urine copper did the CNM lead to increased excretion (1.51 +/- 0.59 mumol/24 hr; copper input 20 mumol/day), compared to SI (1.00 +/- 0.70 mumol/day, p less than 0.001 Mann-Whitney test) suggesting possible interaction. It is concluded that micronutrient status was maintained during short-term IVN with the CNM and that it did not lead to a significantly greater loss of vitamins or essential trace elements than the SI system.\r"

Patients were divided into three groups: (1) oral diet, no intravenous vitamins given; (2) TPN plus 5 ml MVI; and (3) TPN plus 10 ml MVI. Vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B6, and niacin were measured initially and weekly during a 6-week study period. Caloric and nitrogen balances were quantified. Most of the patients in all three groups had normal blood or urine levels of all water-soluble vitamins. No clinical evidence of vitamin deficiency or MVI toxicity was detected. The recommended parenteral dosages of vitamin C (100 mg/day) and B3 (15 mg/day) provided measurably adequate levels in all patients. Levels of vitamins B1, B2, B6, and niacin that were less than the normal range were noted in 4-40% of patients receiving the recommended daily dosages of 3 mg, 3.6 mg, 4 mg, and 40 mg, respectively. These deficiencies appeared to improve in group III patients who received twice the recommended parenteral vitamin dosages, although they did not completely disappear. Niacin deficiency appeared to be the most prevalent, occurring in 40% of patients studied. Since intravenous doses of B1, B2, B6, and niacin are safe and well tolerated, it appears that increased daily amounts of these vitamins should be given to cancer patients on parenteral nutrition.\r"

This prospective study was performed to examine the complications associated with the use of these catheters in patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Seventy-five patients undergoing catheterization were randomly separated into two groups: 36 patients underwent placement of a single lumen catheter (SLC), and 39 patients, a triple lumen catheter (TLC). The two groups were comparable with respect to concomitant infections, treatment with antibiotics, and need for intensive care. Patients in the SLC group received TPN for a mean of 9.7 days and in the TLC group, for a mean of 8.5 days (p = 0.427). However, after 5 days of catheterization, there was a marked increase in the number of TLC removed because of skin entry site infections. SLC were more likely to be used for the full duration of TPN administration (p = 0.025). Catheter tips were cultured by semiquantitative techniques. A higher incidence of catheter sepsis was seen with TLC, 12.8% vs 0% with SLC (p = 0.055). TLC used for TPN are associated with higher rates of catheter entry site infections and systemic sepsis. SLC should be used for TPN administration.\r"

Fourteen (17%) patients in the study group had their original catheter removed for complications (five for septicemia and nine for mechanical complications) compared to 57 (16%) of the patients in the control group. Thirteen (16%) of the 83 catheters in the study group were double lumen and only two of these (15%) were replaced due to complications. Sixteen of 59 patients (27%), 13 years old or older, who arrived with a single lumen RAC already inserted, required an additional catheter during the transplant procedure because of an increased need for intravenous access. From this study, we concluded that patients who arrived for marrow transplantation with a RAC already inserted did not routinely need the catheter replaced. However, it is recommended that double lumen catheters be inserted in adult patients if marrow transplantation is anticipated.\r"

In 25 patients, the CVC was placed in the superior cava via the subclavian, and, in 12, via the jugular vein. Overall, 82 CVC changes were performed.: 74 for assumed CVC sepsis, 6 as preventive treatment, and 2 for partial catheter displacement. Catheter tip culture proved to be positive in 25 of 119 CVC examined. The catheters were defined as sterile when the tip culture was negative; contaminated, when the tip culture was positive and peripheral blood culture was either negative or positive for different bacteria; septic when both tip and blood were positive for the same bacteria. The results indicated that 10 catheters were contaminated and 17 were septic. Eight previously sterile CVC were found positive after the exchange: 3 were removed at the end of TPN in asymptomatic patients, and 5 were successfully resterilized by means of one more change. Guidewire replacement allowed CVC sterilization of 22 of 24 catheters (91.6%). No complications due to the catheter-changing method were seen.\r"

We studied the effect of a glucose and a glucose/fat TPN energy regimen on hepatic chemical composition and the development of steatosis in newborn miniature pigs. Twenty miniature pigs were randomized at 10 days of age to receive a TPN regimen which utilized either glucose (group A) or glucose/fat (group B) as the non-nitrogen energy source. After 8 days, blood was drawn for insulin, glucagon, SGPT, albumin, and bilirubin determinations. Samples of liver were obtained at 9 days. Plasma insulin levels were significantly higher and glucagon levels lower in group A piglets than in those in group B. Normal values were obtained for SGPT, albumin, and bilirubin, and no differences were found between groups. Chemical analysis of the livers revealed no differences between groups in the concentrations of glycogen, fat, protein, DNA, and RNA. Group A animals had significantly higher concentrations of water than group B (group A: 0.75 +/- 0.01 liter/kg; group B: 0.74 +/- 0.01; p less than 0.03). A significant correlation was found in group B between the plasma insulin/glucagon ratio and the hepatic glycogen concentration (r = 0.73, p less than 0.05). Group A animals had fat vacuoles in centrilobular hepatocytes, in contrast with group B animals who had visible fat only in Kupffer cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The only difference between the two groups was the nature of the 20% lipid emulsion. In one group, this emulsion contained only long-chain triglycerides (LCTs), and in the other it contained a mixture (vol/vol) of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) and LCTs. MCTs thus were given in an amount of about 30% of the total energy supplied. During infusion with the MCT/LCT mixture, C8, C10, and C12 fatty acids appeared in the total plasma fatty acids. When the infusion was stopped, the medium-chain fatty acids disappeared; those with shorter chains did so more rapidly. The plasma triglyceride clearance was faster for the MCT/LCT mixture than for the LCTs, whereas phospholipid and cholesterol clearance seemed slower for the MCT/LCT mixture. With this mixture, there was a slight increase in the plasma concentrations of ketone bodies, lactate, and pyruvate, and a slight decrease in plasma glucose. The MCT/LCT mixture was well tolerated, causing no discernible problems, and, in particular, no signs of narcosis or encephalopathy.\r"

A contributing factor to the hepatic dysfunction may be a contaminant of the TPN solution, such as aluminum, that accumulates in liver and may act as a hepatotoxin. To study the hepatic effects of aluminum, growing piglets were given daily intravenous injections of aluminum, 1.5 mg/kg, for 50 days; pair-fed controls were given heparinized saline. At sacrifice, liver and serum were obtained. Liver was analyzed for histopathology and for aluminum content and localization. The hepatocyte lysosomes of the experimental group showed aluminum peaks by x-ray microanalysis, whereas the control group did not. No differences in ultrastructure were noted between the two groups when examined by electron microscopy. Mean serum total bile acid levels (27.8 +/- 15.9 SD vs 6.3 +/- 1.5 mumol/liter, p less than 0.05), mean alkaline phosphatase (309 +/- 108 vs 180 +/- 27 IU/liter, p = NS), and mean hepatic copper content (24.8 +/- 4.5 vs 14.4 +/- micrograms/g dry weight, p less than 0.01), were elevated in the aluminum-loaded piglets, indicating that cholestasis may have been produced. Also, a small but significant reduction in serum levels of 25 hydroxy-vitamin D was found in the aluminum-loaded piglets, suggesting that vitamin D hydroxylation may be impaired. Inasmuch as lysosomal contents are excreted into the bile, aluminum accumulation in lysosomes may alter lysosomal function and possibly affect bile flow or content.\r"

The patient was totally supported by intravenous nutrition during the study. Each enteral feeding solution was administered at full strength at 50 ml/hr for 2 days with a 24-hr collection of pancreatic secretions by the duodenal cutaneous fistula taken on the second day. Infusion of the enteral feeding solutions did not alter volume of fistula drainage. All solutions decreased bicarbonate and amylase secretion but increased lipase and total nitrogen excretion. From this study, it would appear reasonable to administer Vivonex HN and Criticare HN via the jejunum in patients with pancreatic disease, whereas Osmolite would appear less satisfactory, due to its much stronger stimulation of lipase secretion.\r"

Thymic lymphomas appeared with a short latent period of 4-5 weeks in BALB/c mice and 8 weeks in C57BL/6 mice. Cell lines derived from some thymic lymphomas presented a very immature phenotype and did not express cellular markers of either T-cells (Thy 1.2, Lyt 1.2, and Lyt 2.2) or B-cells (cytoplasmic IgM) even after treatment with several differentiation inducers. Molecular analysis showed that T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain genes were never rearranged; in one case only, rearrangement of TCR gamma chain genes could be demonstrated, confirming the immaturity of the presumptive T-cell lines studied. Furthermore, the cell lines consistently carried diversity (D)-joining (J) but not variable (V)-D-J rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. On the whole, these findings suggest that following intrathymic A-MuLV injection neoplastic transformation does involve lymphocytes possibly of T-cell lineage, at a very early stage of differentiation.\r"

Exposure to combinations of IL-1 and IFN-gamma resulted in three categories of cell response. The first was cell lines in which IL-1 stimulated growth and offset the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma. These lines included the lung carcinoma CALU-1 and the colon carcinoma SW-48. The second was some of the cell lines that were refractory to IL-1 and that were inhibited by IFN-gamma alone. These included the cervical carcinoma HeLa, the transformed milk line HBL-100, and the myelogenous leukemia K562. The third group consisted of cells in which growth inhibition by IL-1 and IFN-gamma was additive. These included the mammary carcinomas MCF-7 and MDA-MB-415. The exception to this latter group was ME-180 in which significant additive inhibitory effects could not be demonstrated. IL-1 alone primarily induced a cytostatic effect in growth-inhibited cell lines. The cytolytic effect induced by IFN-gamma was increased in the presence of IL-1. The data support the conclusion that the effects on growth of IL-1 and IFN-gamma are mediated by different mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Late-occurring biologic effects were studied in beagle dogs that were given graded levels of 90SrCl2 via single brief inhalation exposures and were subsequently observed for their life-span. Due to the soluble chemical form of the aerosol, 90Sr was rapidly translocated from lung and deposited in bone where it was subsequently retained for a long period of time. Radiation-induced lesions were confined to the bone, bone marrow, and adjacent soft tissue. Forty-five primary bone tumors occurred in 31 of 66 exposed dogs. Metastasis occurred from 21 tumors, with the lung being the most frequent site of metastasis (76%). Twenty-seven tumors were classified as different subtypes of osteosarcoma, 14 as hemangiosarcomas, 3 as fibrosarcomas, and 1 as a myxosarcoma. Four carcinomas arising from soft tissues adjacent to bone were also considered to be 90Sr induced. In contrast to bone tumors arising in beagles chronically exposed to 90Sr through ingestion, histologic lesions of radiation osteodystrophy were minimal in this study, indicating that these lesions are not a necessary precursor of osteosarcoma development. The incidences of hemangiosarcomas (31%) and telangiectatic osteosarcomas (11%) in addition to osteosarcomas suggest that the cell of origin for all of these neoplasms is a multipotent mesenchymal cell with the potential for various morphologic expressions dependent on local environmental factors.\r"

Moreover, chronic exposure to aldosterone is associated with a remarkable morphological-functional adaptation. This is seen as a magnification in basolateral membrane area of principal cells. In the present paper we investigated the acquistion of Na/K-ATPase alpha-subunit in renal tissue and examined whether aldosterone initiates functional and adaptive changes in cultured collecting duct cells similar to those observed in vivo. Using a monoclonal antibody, immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated the acquisition of the alpha-subunit of Na/K-ATPase in the developing cortical collecting ducts of the kidney of neonatal rabbits. The mature collecting ducts in the medulla and papilla of the developing kidney were strongly labelled at the basolateral side, while in the cortical portion of the fetal collecting duct adjacent to the embryonic ampullae the immunolabel was found at the apical and the basolateral aspect of the epithelium. However, the embryonic collecting duct ampullae in the outer cortex did not show any reaction with the antibody. In the collecting duct cells cultured for 24 hours the alpha-subunit of Na/K-ATPase was found to be distributed at both the apical and basolateral aspect of the epithelium. After two to 16 days, the immunolabel was strictly found distributed at the basolateral side. Culturing collecting duct cells in the presence of aldosterone (10(-6) M), the hormone modulated the cellular shape of epithelia after five days by infolding the lateral plasma membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of chronically hemodialyzed patients to metabolize acetate during conventional hemodialysis was evaluated using a retrospective study in 219 patients dialyzed for up to ten years under similar dialysis conditions. For each patient, and using all available data, a regression line relating the changes of plasma total CO2 during dialysis as a function of the pre-dialysis value was calculated. The intercept of this function indicates the plasma concentration where the losses of bicarbonate in the dialysate is matched by the generation of bicarbonate arising from the metabolism of acetate. This value therefore represents an individual index of the capacity of each patient to metabolize acetate. A value for this index smaller than 18.0 mM was considered abnormal. It was shown that around 10% of chronically hemodialyzed patients are clearly unable to metabolize acetate optimally. This defect is not related to the duration of dialysis, body weight or quality of hemodialysis treatments but is strongly related to sex, 19 of the 22 \"acetate intolerant\" patients being women. In a prospective study, all the 60 patients of the same population undergoing active dialysis were studied, and this index identified 12 abnormal (11 women, 1 man) patients and 48 normal patients. Plasma acetate measured at the end their dialysis treatments were significantly higher in abnormal than in normal patients. It is concluded: that this index is useful to identify the patients unable to metabolize acetate optimally; that only around 10% of hemodialyzed patients present a severe problem when dialyzed against acetate and should be dialyzed against bicarbonate; that dialysis against acetate does not fully correct the metabolic acidosis even in \"normal\" patients.\r"

  ".W": "The need for a more accurate method of detecting episodes of myocardial ischemia during cardiac operations, particularly during the ischemic arrest interval, prompted us to investigate the usefulness of measuring the active extraction of technetium pyrophosphate in identifying and quantitating ischemic injury. Twenty-four adult mongrel dogs were subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass, and normothermic global ischemia was induced by cross-clamping the proximal aorta. Technetium pyrophosphate (1 mCi) was injected through a standard cardioplegia line with normal saline, simulating administration of cardioplegic solution, upon placement of the aortic cross-clamp (time 0), at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes of global ischemia, and with the onset and completion of ischemic contracture. Radioactive counts were recorded over the heart at 1 second intervals, and the extraction fraction and half-time of clearance were calculated. The extraction fraction increased from 0.22 at time 0 to 0.58 at 15 minutes, 0.82 at 30 minutes, 0.85 at 45 minutes, and 0.91 at 60 minutes. The halftime increased from a baseline of 114 seconds (time 0) to a maximum of 321 seconds at 60 minutes of ischemia. The onset and completion of ischemic contracture showed a return toward baseline of both the extraction fraction and halftime of clearance, with an extraction fraction of 0.44 and 0.46 and a halftime of 135 and 133 seconds, respectively. These data clearly show that reversible myocardial injury increased the extraction and reduced the clearance of technetium pyrophosphate and that the magnitude of change related to the extent of injury. The progression to irreversible myocardial injury decreased the active extraction of technetium pyrophosphate. This simple procedure for real-time documentation of myocardial injury promises to provide easily obtainable endpoints of injury for use during cardiac operations in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The internal mammary artery is a dynamic coronary graft, whereas the saphenous vein graft is passive. Therefore, potential exists not only for beneficial vasodilation but also for catastrophic spasm of the artery. The purpose of this study was to examine blood flow in the internal mammary and saphenous vein grafts during infusion of drugs that are commonly used after cardiac operations. A canine right heart bypass preparation allowed precise control of cardiac output, blood pressure, and heart rate, which were maintained constant during drug infusion. Both the internal mammary and saphenous vein grafts were constructed so that they perfused the same coronary bed: They were anastomosed in a Y fashion to a ligated anterior descending coronary artery. Electromagnetic flow probes measured graft flow (with the other graft occluded) before and after 15 minutes of drug infusion. The order of drug infusion was randomized and changes were compared by tests for paired differences. Phenylephrine (2 micrograms/kg/min) decreased flow in both the internal mammary and saphenous vein grafts, whereas norepinephrine (0.1 microgram/kg/min) increased flow in both grafts. Epinephrine (0.05 microgram/kg/min) increased mammary artery flow 16% +/- 6% but decreased saphenous vein graft flow 9% +/- 7%. Nitroglycerin (1 microgram/kg/min) significantly increased internal mammary flow (36% +/- 13%), from 47 +/- 7 to 59 +/- 7 ml/min (p less than 0.01), whereas flow decreased significantly in the saphenous vein graft 14% +/- 3%, from 64 +/- 9 to 59 +/- 8 ml/min (p less than 0.01). Nitroprusside (1 microgram/kg/min) decreased mammary artery flow 12% +/- 2%, from 50 +/- 7 to 44 +/- 7 ml/min (p less than 0.01), but increased saphenous vein graft flow 25% +/- 8%, from 64 +/- 9 to 77 +/- 7 ml/min (p less than 0.01). All hemodynamic variables were unchanged, except for norepinephrine, which significantly increased the first derivative of left ventricular pressure. The results suggest that flow through the canine internal mammary artery is changed by the drugs commonly used in perioperative management. Epinephrine and nitroglycerin increased internal mammary artery flow and decreased saphenous vein graft flow, whereas nitroprusside had the opposite effect. The vascular reactivity of the internal mammary artery must be considered when these drugs are used after coronary revascularization.\r"

More than two-thirds of the patients died, and the most common cause of death was a lymphoid malignant process. Almost a fifth of the patients with an apparently benign monoclonal gammopathy subsequently had a lymphoid malignant lesion (in one patient, more than 20 years after the detection of the serum M protein). The median duration of time from the recognition of the M protein until the development of a malignant lymphoid disease ranged from 4 to 9 years. An increased number of lymphocytes or plasma cells on bone marrow examination was not a reliable indicator of the likelihood of such an outcome. Thus, follow-up of these patients should be conducted indefinitely.\r"

In the course of follow-up, 16 patients had at least one reinfarction (fatal recurrences in 9 and nonfatal in 7) and 1 died suddenly. High plasma concentrations of the fast-acting plasminogen activator inhibitor were independently related to reinfarction along with dyslipoproteinaemia involving VLDL and HDL, poor left ventricular performance, and multiple-vessel coronary artery disease. Besides being independently associated with reinfarction in the present population, high triglyceride levels were possibly connected with a predisposition to thrombosis through a coexisting high level of plasminogen activator inhibitor. The data indicate that reduced fibrinolytic capacity due to increased plasma levels of the plasminogen activator inhibitor predisposes to reinfarction in a complex interplay with atherogenic factors, multiple coronary lesions, and compromised left ventricular function.\r"

Other aminoglycosides and antituberculous drugs did not interfere with the assay. In serial CSF samples from patients with tuberculous meningitis tuberculostearic acid was still present after 8 months of continuous supervised chemotherapy. Detection of tuberculostearic acid in CSF is a rapid, sensitive, and specific test for tuberculous meningitis, and can be used for retrospective diagnosis in patients who have been started on therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Sensory deafness may be associated with partial or total obliteration of the cochlear scalae. Before undertaking cochlear implant surgery, a preoperative assessment of cochlear patency with high-resolution computed tomography (CT) is indicated. To determine the accuracy of pre-implant CT, a review of the radiographic and surgical findings in 36 implanted ears was performed. An abnormal CT scan was found to be a reliable predictor of compromised cochlear patency at operation. These findings help the surgeon to select the side most favorable for implantation and to anticipate problems that may be encountered during device insertion. A normal pre-implant CT scan, however, does not exclude the possibility of compromised cochlear patency. A 46% false negative rate was encountered, presumably because subtle degrees of osseous or fibrous obliteration of the cochlea are beyond the resolution by current generation CT scanners. In our opinion, the radiographic finding of cochlear ossification is not a contraindication to an attempt at cochlear implantation. The only assured way of determining the extent of cochlear patency is by performing an \"exploratory cochleostomy\" with fenestration of the basal cochlear turn. Drilling anteriorly through an ossified basal scala tympani will often expose an adequate lumen and permit insertion of even a long multichannel electrode into a partially ossified cochlea. Nevertheless, it is essential that the implant team be prepared with devices appropriate for whatever existing or surgically created lumen may be available.\r"

The epithelial cells significantly induced mesenchymal cells to produce collagenase.

The CO2 laser bronchoscopic coupler, CO2 laser waveguide, Nd-YAG laser fiber, and Nd-YAG laser contact probe were used. A 5 mm diameter soft tissue injury exposing tracheal cartilage was made, and the power density for each laser modality was measured. Soft tissue effects were documented histologically using routine techniques and scanning electron microscopy acutely and at 1 week and 2 weeks after injury. The effects were similar with the CO2 laser coupler and the CO2 laser waveguide with comparable power densities. Compared with the CO2 laser, the Nd-YAG laser fiber caused more extensive and more difficult to control thermal damage in tissue. The Nd-YAG laser contact probe was capable of precise soft tissue ablation with minimal surrounding tissue damage and was associated with the most rapid healing. This study concluded that high power density with short exposures is desirable when treating benign disorders, such as tracheal stenosis, making the CO2 laser or Nd-YAG laser contact probe application a good choice. On the other hand, malignant tumors with a potential for hemorrhage are best treated with the Nd-YAG laser noncontact fiber system because of its superior coagulative effects.\r"

Investigations lasting approximately 60 min were performed in the early follicular phase beginning at 3.30 p.m. after two months of training with isokinetic (\"Nautilus\") equipment. Baseline testosterone and non-sex hormone binding globulin bound testosterone levels were significantly higher in subjects than in a control group. Increased total and non-sex hormone binding globulin bound testosterone was observed immediately prior to exercise with further increases late in exercise, then with proportional increases in cortisol and lactic acid. Sex hormone binding globulin-binding capacity increased before exercise. The testosterone increments exceeded hemoconcentration. Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels increased during exercise. The data suggest that origins of the exercise-associated testosterone increment are complex, resulting from hemoconcentration and specific gonadal and adrenal responses.\r"

We conducted a clinical study to determine the efficacy of spectinomycin treatment in 124 U.S. servicemen in the Republic of Korea who had urethral gonococcal infections. Ninety-seven patients were treated with spectinomycin alone and evaluated in a follow-up visit. In eight patients (8.2 percent), this treatment was unsuccessful. Antibiotic-sensitivity testing on isolates from seven of the patients with treatment failure demonstrated that six isolates were highly resistant to spectinomycin (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than or equal to 100 micrograms per milliliter). None of the spectinomycin-resistant strains had become resistant to penicillin, either through the production of penicillinase or through a chromosomal mutation. Although the mechanism of spectinomycin resistance appears to be a chromosomal mutation, these isolates were generally sensitive to other antibiotics. The prevalence of resistance to spectinomycin resulted in the substitution of ceftriaxone for the primary treatment of gonorrhea acquired by U.S. military personnel in the Republic of Korea. We believe that the rapid emergence of spectinomycin resistance in this population mandates a cautious approach to widescale use of the drug and indicates a need to broaden current surveillance programs.\r"

Pharmacologically distinguishable forms of the mAChR occur in different tissues and have provisionally been classified into M1 (I), M2 cardiac (II) and M2 glandular (III) subtypes on the basis of their difference in apparent affinity for antagonists. In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of the functional heterogeneity of the mAChR, we have cloned and sequenced DNAs complementary to porcine cerebral and cardiac messenger RNAs encoding mAChRs and have thereby deduced the primary structures of the receptor proteins. We report here that the messenger RNA generated by transcription of the cardiac complementary DNA directs the formation of a functional mAChR in Xenopus oocytes and that this mAChR differs from the mAChR formed by expression of the cerebral cDNA both in acetylcholine (ACh)-induced response and in antagonist binding properties. Our results provide evidence indicating that the mAChR encoded by the cerebral cDNA (designated as mAChR I) and the mAChR encoded by the cardiac cDNA (mAChR II) are of the M1 (I) and the M2 cardiac (II) subtype, respectively.\r"

Infection of T cells with a retrovirus, termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is thought to be important in these abnormalities. HIV infection alone does not adequately explain the CD4+ T-cell abnormalities seen in AIDS, however, and the nature of T-cell destruction in this disease remains poorly characterized. Here we describe an AIDS-related serum autoantibody that reacts with an antigen of relative molecular mass 18,000 (Mr 18K) restricted to lectin-stimulated or HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. The antibody also suppresses proliferation of CD4+ T cells in vitro and induces cytotoxicity of these cells in the presence of complement. Its role in the development of AIDS merits attention.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) seem to provide the major line of defence against many viruses. CTL effector functions are mediated primarily by cells carrying the CD8 (Ly-2) antigen (CD8+ cells) and are triggered by interactions of the T-cell receptor with an antigenic complex, often termed 'self plus X', composed of viral determinants in association with class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The mechanism(s) of induction of virus-specific CTL in vivo is poorly understood, but data from in vitro experiments suggest that their generation is strictly dependent on functions provided by CD4+ helper T cells (also referred to as L3T4+; or TH) that respond to antigens in the context of class II (Ia) MHC determinants. The prevailing opinion that induction of most functions of CD8+ cells requires help provided by CD4+ cells has recently been challenged by the observation that CD8+ cells alone can mediate a variety of responses to alloantigens in vitro and in vivo; however, the possibility that CTL to self plus X could be generated in vivo in the absence of TH cells has not been evaluated. We report here that C57BL/6J (B6) and AKR/J mice, when functionally depleted of CD4+ cells by in vivo treatment with the CD4+-specific rat monoclonal antibody GK1.5 (refs 8-14) responded to ectromelia virus infection by developing an optimal in vivo virus-specific CTL response, and subsequently recovered from the disease (mousepox) that was lethal for similarly infected nude mice (CD4-, CD8-).\r"

  ".W": "Coupling between ATP hydrolysis and microtubule movement was demonstrated several years ago in flagellar axonemes and subsequent studies suggest that the relevant microtubule motor, dynein, uses ATP to drive microtubule sliding by a cross-bridge mechanism analogous to that of myosin in muscles. Kinesin, a microtubule-based motility protein which may participate in organelle transport and mitosis, binds microtubules in a nucleotide-sensitive manner, and requires hydrolysable nucleotides to translocate microtubules over a glass surface. Recently, neuronal kinesin was shown to possess microtubule-activated ATPase activity although coupling between ATP hydrolysis and motility was not demonstrated. Here we report that sea urchin egg kinesin, prepared either with or without a 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate(AMPPNP)-induced microtubule binding step, also possesses significant microtubule-activated ATPase activity when Mg-ATP is used as a substrate. This ATPase activity is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by addition of Mg-free ATP, by chelation of Mg2+ with EDTA, by addition of Na3VO4, or by addition of AMPPNP with or without Mg2+. Addition of these same reagents also inhibits the microtubule-translocating activities of sea urchin egg kinesin in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the hypothesis that kinesin-driven motility is coupled to the microtubule-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity.\r"

  ".U": "87258257\r", 
  ".W": "CD4 is a molecule expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes which recognize foreign protein antigens in the context of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Recognition of antigen:class II MHC complexes by CD4+ T cells can be inhibited by anti-CD4 (ref. 3). Nevertheless, specific recognition of the antigen:Ia complex is clearly a function of the T-cell receptor, which is composed of CD3 and the variable polypeptides alpha and beta. Thus, it has been proposed that CD4 serves an accessory function in the interaction of CD4+ T cells and Ia-bearing antigen-presenting cells by binding to non-polymorphic portions of class II MHC molecules and stabilizing the cell interaction. Based on our observation that anti-CD4 could inhibit activation of a cloned line of CD4+ T cells by antibodies directed at a particular epitope on the variable region of the T-cell receptor, we have recently proposed that CD4 is actually part of the T-cell antigen recognition complex, physically associated with CD3:alpha:beta. But numerous studies showing that CD3 and CD4 are not stably associated on the T-cell surface would appear to contradict this model. Here we show that anti-T-cell-receptor antibodies can co-modulate expression of the T-cell receptor and CD4, and that the monovalent Fab fragment of such an anti-T-cell-receptor antibody can, in conjunction with bivalent anti-CD4 antibody, generate an activating signal for the T cell. These findings provide further evidence for a physical association of the T-cell receptor complex and CD4.\r"

  ".W": "The epidermis of normal mice contains two distinct populations of dendritic cells derived from the bone marrow, Ia+ Langerhans cells and Ia- cells that express the Thy-1 alloantigen. The Thy-1-bearing dendritic epidermal cells (Thy-1+ dEC) have a surface phenotype similar to that of very early T-lineage cells, produce IL-2-like growth factors and exhibit cytotoxicity which is not restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The relationship of Thy-1+ dEC to the T-cell lineage is unclear. Most T lymphocytes bear a receptor for antigen composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain associated with a nonpolymorphic complex termed CD3 (T3). A minor population carries a receptor in which CD3 is associated with a gamma/delta complex. We have analysed clones of Thy-1+ dEC for rearrangement and expression of the genes for the alpha-, beta- and gamma-chains of the T-cell receptor (TCR). They do not express alpha or beta but do carry a gamma/delta complex. Activation of the cells with Con A is associated with a rapid decrease in the steady-state level of gamma-chain RNA. Because Thy-1+ dEC resemble early stage T lymphocytes, down-regulation of TCR expression may reflect a necessary event during T cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The morphology of the nasal bones and their articulations with the adjoining frontal and maxillary bones have recently been reported in Nature and elsewhere to be diagnostic of hominoid taxa, and cladistic analysis based on these features has been used to assign two immature Plio-Pleistocene hominoids (AL 333-105 and Taung) to different lineages (Paranthropus and Homo, respectively). Because earlier studies had established that hominoid crania are highly variable intraspecifically, it seemed desirable to try to replicate the study reporting a consistently different pattern for each hominoid taxon. My results show extensive polymorphism in the nasal region within every taxon of extant pongids, including several rather clear examples, in extant Pan troglodytes, of that recently hypothesized to be a 'paranthropine' pattern. These findings underscore the substantial risks inherent in cladistic analyses using very restricted character sets to assign individual specimens to particular taxa.\r"

  ".U": "87258275\r", 
  ".W": "The CD4 (T4) antigen was originally described as a phenotypic marker specific for helper T cells, and has recently been shown to be the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Functional studies using monoclonal antibodies directed at CD4 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules led to the suggestion that CD4 binds to the MHC class II molecules expressed on stimulator cells, enhancing T-cell responsiveness by increasing the avidity of T cell-stimulator cell interaction and/or by transmitting a positive intracellular signal. But recent evidence that antibodies to CD4 inhibit T-cell responsiveness in the absence of any putative ligand for CD4 has been interpreted as suggesting that antibody-mediated inhibition may involve the transmission of a negative signal via the CD4 molecule instead. We have infected a murine T-cell hybridoma that produces interleukin 2 (IL-2) in response to human class II HLA-DR antigens with a retroviral vector containing CD4 cDNA. The resulting CD4-expressing hybridoma cell lines produce 6- to 20-fold more IL-2 in response to HLA-DR antigens than control cell lines. Furthermore, when antigen levels are suboptimal, the response of the cell lines is entirely CD4-dependent. The data presented here clearly demonstrate that CD4 can enhance T-cell responsiveness and may be crucial in the response to suboptimal levels of antigen.\r"

  ".W": "We treated 18 clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS patients with recombinant gamma interferon in a pilot study designed to evaluate toxicity and dosage. Patients received low (1 microgram), intermediate (30 micrograms), or high (1,000 micrograms) doses of interferon by intravenous infusion twice a week for 4 weeks. Serum levels of gamma interferon were proportional to dose and no interferon was detected in CSF. Seven of the 18 patients had exacerbations during treatment, a significant increase compared with the prestudy exacerbation rate (p less than 0.01). Exacerbations occurred in all three dosage groups and were not precipitated by fever or other dose-dependent side effects. There were significant increases in circulating monocytes bearing class II (HLA-DR) surface antigen, in the proliferative responses of peripheral blood leukocytes, and in natural killer cell activity. These results show that systemic administration of gamma interferon has pronounced effects on cellular immunity in MS and on disease activity within the CNS, suggesting that the attacks induced during treatment were immunologically mediated. Gamma interferon is unsuitable for use as a therapeutic agent in MS. Agents that specifically inhibit gamma interferon production or counteract its effects on immune cells should be investigated as candidates for experimental therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In 12 patients with intractable partial seizures, chronically implanted subdural electrodes were used to define the relationship of the epileptogenic focus to cortical functional areas. Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to median nerve stimulation were recorded from these electrodes. The initial cortical positivity, postrolandic primary cortical potential (PCP), was recorded in all 12 patients with a mean latency of 22.3 +/- 1.6 msec. A potential of opposite polarity, prerolandic PCP, was defined in nine patients with a mean latency of 24.1 +/- 2.7 msec. The latency of the postrolandic PCP was 1.61 +/- 1.59 msec shorter than the prerolandic PCP (p less than 0.01, paired t test). The maximum amplitude postrolandic PCP was 2.1 times larger than the maximum prerolandic PCP (p less than 0.02, paired t test). The phase reversal of the SEPs was compared with the position of the rolandic fissure (RF) defined by electrical stimulation. This study shows that the latency and amplitude characteristics of post- and prerolandic PCPs are significantly different and give support to the concept that they are produced by different generators; and cortical SEPs are helpful in locating the RF.\r"

Of 44 patients, 45.5% were lupus anticoagulant positive (greater than 1.3) and 20.5% were within a borderline range (1.2-1.3). Antinuclear antibody positivity was inversely related to stage of disease (P = .009); lupus anticoagulant positivity exhibited a similar trend, but did not reach statistical significance. Of 31 endometriosis patients, 64.5% exhibited immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies and 45.2% demonstrated IgM autoantibodies to at least one of 16 antigens investigated. Among IgG autoantibodies, those to phospholipids were most frequently detected, followed in order of frequency by antibodies to histones and nucleotides. The incidence of IgM autoantibodies was inverted, with antinucleotides appearing most frequently and antiphospholipids least frequently. A strong correlation was noted between the presence of lupus anticoagulant and antinuclear antibody with both IgG and IgM autoantibodies. These observations suggest that endometriosis is associated with abnormal polyclonal B cell activation, a classic characteristic of autoimmune disease. This contention is further supported in that immunoglobulin levels (particularly IgG) are elevated in patients with endometriosis, and more so in lupus anticoagulant-positive than lupus anticoagulant-negative endometriosis patients (P = .021).\r"

After satisfactory sperm migration through the mucus, the capillaries were broken and cultured at different distances from the original insemination site. Mucus fractions in proximity to bacterial inocula grew varying amounts of the pathogens. More distal fractions of mucus columns were generally culture-negative even though they contained motile sperm which had been exposed to bacteria. Migration of spermatozoa exposed to bacteria through bovine cervical mucus did not result in enhanced bacterial penetration.\r"

Possible explanations of this apparent discrepancy were examined by measuring sequential changes in fetal arterial acid-base and blood gas values after induced cardiac asystole in chronically instrumented fetal lambs at 132-141 days' gestation. Arterial pH values did not decrease from baseline for at least ten minutes. Elevation of pCO2 values were observed at 30 minutes. Arterial pO2 and HCO3 values remained unchanged for at least 30 minutes. Therefore, we conclude that sudden fetal cardiac asystole occurring within ten minutes of delivery may be one reason why umbilical cord acid-base and blood gas values do not correlate with Apgar scores.\r"
