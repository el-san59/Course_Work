  ".W": "To assess the usefulness of exercise echocardiography in the follow-up of patients after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we studied 56 patients at rest and immediately following exercise with two-dimensional echocardiography. Sixty-nine of 73 stress/echo studies (94%) were suitable for interpretation. Seventeen patients (group I) with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) were studied before and after PTCA. Sixteen patients with coronary disease not undergoing PTCA (group II) and 23 individuals without significant coronary disease (group III) served as age-matched controls. Left ventricular ejection fraction did not change significantly in group I patients prior to PTCA (56 +/- 7 versus 54 +/- 12, p = ns) or in group II patients (52 +/- 10 versus 56 +/- 15, p = ns), rest versus immediate after exercise measurements. Following angioplasty, left ventricular ejection fraction increased in group I patients from 55 +/- 7 to 65 +/- 8, p less than 0.001 from rest to exercise, and to a similar extent in group III individuals (55 +/- 6 to 66 +/- 8, p less than 0.001). Electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of ischemia (greater than 1 mm ST segment depression) was found in 13 of 17 group I patients prior to PTCA and in 8 of 16 group II patients (CAD). None of the 25 normal patients and four of the group I patients following PTCA had abnormal ECG changes with exercise. New exercise-induced echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities were found in 12 of 17 group I patients prior to PTCA and in none of the group I patients following PTCA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This technique uses a sequential series of balloon catheters of gradually increasing size as a means of eventually crossing the very small valve orifice with a balloon catheter of adequate size to achieve successful pulmonary valvuloplasty. The initial dilatations were achieved with balloon catheters 2, 3, or 4 mm in diameter. Immediately after successful balloon valvuloplasty, the mean pulmonary systolic pressure gradient was reduced from 105 +/- 11 to 20 +/- 5 mm Hg. Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty can be performed safely with good results despite critical congenital pulmonary valve obstruction in severely ill infants.\r"

The relation between the presence of angina before AMI and the degree of residual stenosis after coronary thrombolysis was observed in 57 patients with successful coronary thrombolysis for AMI. Patients with significant coronary artery stenoses other than the artery responsible for AMI were excluded from this study. In 22 patients with chronic angina for 2 weeks or longer before AMI, 14 patients had a residual stenosis of 75% or more and 8 patients had a residual stenosis of less than 75%. In 35 patients with angina for less than 2 weeks or not at all before AMI, 9 patients had a residual stenosis of 75% or more, and 26 patients had a residual stenosis of less than 75% (p less than 0.01). In the course of progression of coronary artery disease, some patients had AMI without severe underlying stenosis and others with severe underlying stenosis. Patients with chronic angina before AMI might tend to have AMI with acute occlusion superimposed on the severe organic stenosis. Patients without chronic angina before AMI would be more at risk for AMI caused by acute occlusion without underlying severe stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Between September 1, 1986, and December 31, 1987, sixty-four consecutive patients younger than 70 years, with early (less than 4 hours) symptoms and signs of myocardial infarction, were treated with 1.5 million units streptokinase intravenously in the emergency room (ER group) before admission to the coronary care unit. Data from these patients were compared in retrospect to those of 66 consecutive patients with myocardial infarction who were treated with intravenous streptokinase in the coronary care unit (CCU group) before September 1, 1986. Time between first symptoms and initiation of fibrinolytic therapy was significantly shorter in the ER group: 114 +/- 53 minutes vs 150 +/- 56 minutes in the CCU group (p less than 0.001). The incidence of in-hospital complications was similar in both groups. However, left ventricular stroke work index during the stay in the coronary care unit was 50 +/- 19 gm/m2 in the ER group vs 42 +/- 14 in the CCU group (p = 0.02). Also the echocardiographic left ventricular wall motion score at 48 hours after admission tended to be better in the ER group: 6.7 +/- 4.0 compared to that in the CCU group (7.6 +/- 4.5; p = 0.29). In conclusion, infusion of intravenous streptokinase in the emergency room is feasible and safe and results in a significant time gain leading to a better hemodynamic profile. Within the hospital the emergency room is the ideal place for intravenous fibrinolytic therapy in eligible patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Treadmill exercise tests, electrophysiologic studies, and isoproterenol infusions were performed in 14 patients with exercise provocable supraventricular tachycardia to delineate the mechanisms of exercise provocation of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Treadmill exercise tests reproducibly provoked supraventricular tachycardia in all patients. Supraventricular tachycardia similar to that provoked by exercise occurred spontaneously during isoproterenol infusions in 9 of 11 patients tested. The specific supraventricular tachycardia diagnoses of all patients were atrial reentrant tachycardia (two patients), automatic atrial tachycardia (three), atrial flutter-fibrillation (one), atypical junctional tachycardia (two), and orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia (six) as defined by electrophysiologic studies. Various mechanisms of exercise or isoproterenol induction of supraventricular tachycardia were identified. A critical heart rate and/or appropriate sympathetic state was found to provoke all instances of reentrant or automatic atrial tachycardia and atypical junctional tachycardia. A properly timed atrial premature beat provoked five of six cases of AV reentrant tachycardia and the only case of atrial flutter-fibrillation. The remaining case of AV reentrant tachycardia was induced by a ventricular premature beat. In conclusion, the mechanisms of exercise provocation of reentrant or automatic supraventricular tachycardia are multiple and include a critical sinus rate, increased sympathetic tone, and properly timed atrial or ventricular premature beats.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the likelihood of inducing sustained ventricular tachycardia, we analyzed a cohort of 58 retrospective and 18 prospective patients with chronic coronary artery disease who underwent electrophysiologic study because of spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (three or more beats, lasting less than 30 seconds, at a rate greater than 100/min). In 24 of the 58 retrospective patients (41%) sustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible. Stepwise logistic regression identified two \"major\" variables--left ventricular aneurysm/dyskinesis/akinesis (p = 0.0001; relative risk = 11.88) and ejection fraction less than 40% (p = 0.0002; relative risk = 9.69)--and one \"minor\" variable--nonsustained ventricular tachycardia longer than 10 beats (p = 0.0151; relative risk = 4.21)--as significant predictors of inducibility. Nineteen patients with both major variables had a high probability of inducibility (greater than 90%). Nineteen patients with neither major variable had a low probability of inducibility (less than 5%). The remaining 20 patients with only one of the major variables had an intermediate probability of inducibility (14% to 75%). The significance of the third minor factor, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia longer than 10 beats, was confined to this intermediate group, in which it could be used to segregate relatively high (65% to 75%) and relatively low (14% to 20%) probability of inducibility. Prospective application of the predictor function stratified 18 additional patients into three groups with high (six patients), intermediate (seven patients), and low (five patients) probability of inducibility. The observed rate of inducibility in each group was 5 of 6 (83%), 2 of 7 (29%), and 0 of 5 (0%), respectively. These data suggest that patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and chronic coronary artery disease can be stratified into subgroups with high, intermediate, and low probability of inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia on the basis of ejection fraction and regional ventricular wall motion defects alone.\r"

Standard loading doses of lidocaine were given intravenously followed by 2 mg/min infusions for 79.5 +/- 6.5 hours. Electrophysiologic studies all started more than 5 half-lives or 7.5 hours after discontinuation of intravenous lidocaine. Local anesthesia with subcutaneous lidocaine (mean 162 +/- 96 mg) was administered in six patients. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine and its metabolites were determined at the termination of the infusion, 2 and 4 hours afterwards, at the start of the electrophysiologic study prior to local anesthesia, and at the end of the study. Levels were also determined at 12 and 24 hours after discontinuation of the infusion. Mean plasma concentrations of lidocaine, MEGX, and GX at the start of the study were 1.02, 0.86, and 0.62 micrograms/ml, respectively. These had increased to 2.78, 0.92, and 0.68 by the end of the electrophysiologic study. One patient with coronary artery disease and prior out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation had a therapeutic lidocaine level and no inducible arrhythmia at the time of the initial study. At a subsequent electrophysiologic study, no lidocaine or metabolites were detected in the serum and ventricular fibrillation was induced. Thus using the reported half-life of 90 minutes and discontinuing lidocaine 5 half-lives prior to electrophysiologic evaluation does not ensure lack of electrophysiologic effects of the parent compound or its metabolites. Lidocaine given for local anesthesia further increases lidocaine and metabolite levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Success rates of defibrillation 20 seconds from the onset of ventricular fibrillation were determined at three energy levels with and without a preceding subthreshold shock. Altogether, 637 episodes of fibrillation-defibrillation were performed (63.7 +/- 6.7 per dog). Predicted energy levels for defibrillation success rates of 50% and 80% (E50 and E80) acquired from a logistic regression curve were 0.0303 +/- 0.0064 and 0.0367 +/- 0.0069 joule/gm, respectively, without subthreshold shocks. E50 and E80 with an unsuccessful subthreshold shock resulted in comparable values (E50: 0.0325 +/- 0.0041 joule/gm; E80: 0.0.380 +/- 0.0100 joule/gm).

To assess changes that may occur during sustained exercise, we studied 10 healthy men to determine the effect of 20 minutes of exercise at 25 W above lactate threshold (ALT) and 20 minutes of exercise at 25 W below lactate threshold (BLT). Both conditions showed elevation of catecholamines at end exercise compared to baseline, but catecholamine levels ALT were significantly higher than the levels BLT (2270 +/- 190 versus 900 +/- 230 pg/ml norepinephrine, p less than 0.001; 509 +/- 69 versus 150 +/- 18 pg/ml epinephrine, p less than 0.001). This difference persisted at 2 minutes of recovery (1620 +/- 130 versus 590 +/- 60 pg/ml norepinephrine, p less than 0.001; 216 +/- 31 versus 98 +/- 16 pg/ml epinephrine, p less than 0.001). Both conditions resulted in a significant elevation in potassium at end exercise compared to baseline, but the potassium levels ALT were significantly higher than the levels BLT (1.1 +/- 0.1 mEq/L versus 0.5 +/- 0.1 mEq/L, p less than 0.001. The fall in potassium in the immediate post-exercise period was significantly greater following exercise ALT (-0.8 +/- 0.1 mEq/L versus -0.2 +/- 0.1 mEq/L, p less than 0.001). Thus sustained exercise slightly ALT resulted in a significant potassium flux and very elevated catecholamine levels. Avoiding these metabolic stresses by exercising BLT may decrease chances for exercise-related arrhythmia or other cardiac dysfunction in susceptible patients.\r"

The present study comprising 56 outpatients treated with digoxin was undertaken to elucidate the clinical importance of a standardized period of rest before collection of the blood sample. Blood samples were taken about 24 hours after the latest dose, before and after 2 hours of rest in the supine position. A careful clinical examination, including electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, systolic time intervals, and chest x-ray studies, was performed to identify adverse effects/intoxication or failure of digitalis treatment. Signs of failure of digitalis treatment occurred in 12% of the patients, with a serum digoxin concentration of 0.68 +/- 0.15 (mean +/- SD) nmol/L before rest and 0.85 +/- 0.22 nmol/L after rest. Eleven percent showed signs of adverse effects/intoxication, with serum digoxin concentrations of 1.70 +/- 0.70 nmol/L before rest and 2.08 +/- 0.80 nmol/L after rest. The serum digoxin concentrations of the adequately treated patients (77%) were 1.02 +/- 0.35 nmol/L before rest and 1.28 +/- 0.41 nmol/L after rest. The importance of standardized rest before blood sampling is illustrated by the fact that only one third of the patients without signs of adverse effects/intoxication or failure of digitalis treatment had serum digoxin concentrations within the therapeutic range most commonly used (1.2 to 2.6 nmol/L) without supine rest. If allowed to rest in the supine position before blood sampling, approximately 60% of the adequately treated patients had serum digoxin concentrations within this range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A real-time color flow map of the left ventricular was obtained from an apical two- and five-chamber view and the maximal mosaic pattern of diastolic turbulent flow was planimetered as a reflection of the maximal regurgitant volume using biplane Simpson's rule. The maximal Doppler regurgitant volume evaluated by color Doppler flow mapping correlated with the stroke count ratio measured by scintigraphy (r = 0.86, SEE = 11 cc). There were significant relationships between maximal regurgitant volume measured by color Doppler and echocardiographic left ventricular end-diastolic volume (r = 0.88), left ventricular end-systolic volume (r = 0.77), and left ventricular mass (r = 0.71). Patients with larger regurgitant volumes tended to have a larger left ventricular end-diastolic volume-to-mass ratio (r = 0.56). Thus maximal aortic regurgitant volume can be estimated noninvasively with color Doppler flow mapping. The measurement appears to relate to left ventricular morphologic changes occurring in this condition and it may prove to be useful in assessing patients with chronic aortic insufficiency and in determining their long-term management.\r"

  ".U": "89225726\r", 
  ".W": "In acute aortic regurgitation, left ventricular pressure rises rapidly during diastole, which produces presystolic mitral valve closure. This does not occur in chronic aortic regurgitation. Since normal, nonregurgitant mitral valve closure may depend on properly coordinated atrial and ventricular contractions, we hypothesized that abnormal mitral valve closure occurring before systole in acute aortic regurgitation may produce diastolic mitral regurgitation detectable by Doppler echocardiography. Accordingly, we performed ultrasonic Doppler examination of seven patients with acute aortic regurgitation and 12 patients with chronic aortic regurgitation. Regurgitant aortic flow was severe in all cases. Doppler sampling within the left atrium demonstrated regurgitant mitral flow in late diastole in all patients with acute aortic regurgitation. The onset of diastolic mitral regurgitation coincided with mitral valve preclosure in patients with acute aortic regurgitation and occurred regardless of the position of the mitral leaflets at the initiation of closure. In contrast, none of the 12 patients with chronic aortic regurgitation had mitral valve preclosure or diastolic mitral regurgitation (p less than 0.05 versus acute aortic regurgitation). We conclude that diastolic mitral regurgitation accompanies mitral valve preclosure, which occurs in acute but not chronic aortic regurgitation. Thus diastolic mitral regurgitation may be a Doppler sign of acute aortic regurgitation, in the absence of a markedly prolonged PR interval. Furthermore, this observation suggests that normal, nonregurgitant mitral closure requires more than an increase in left ventricular pressure above left atrial pressure, regardless of the position of the mitral leaflets before closure.\r"

In cine magnetic resonance images, disturbed (high velocity) blood flow produces a loss of signal intensity within the intracavitary blood pool, which makes this technique potentially useful for evaluating valvular disease. Multilevel cine magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 26 patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) documented and graded for severity by Doppler echocardiography or contrast ventriculography. Intracavitary left atrial signal intensity was analyzed in order to derive parameters that reflect the severity of the lesion. Seven normal volunteers were studied for comparison. All regurgitant lesions were visualized in cine magnetic resonance images as discrete regions of systolic signal loss extending from the mitral valve into the left atrium. The extent and degree of signal loss correlated well with severity. In patients with mild MR, signal loss was seen in 3.3 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD) anatomic levels compared to 4.9 +/- 1.4 levels in patients with moderate MR (p = NS), and in 7.0 +/- 1.4 levels in patients with severe MR (p less than 0.001 versus mild MR). The total area of maximal systolic left atrial signal loss seen in all levels was 10 +/- 6 cm2 in mild versus 31 +/- 17 cm2 in moderate (p less than 0.001) and 96 +/- 30 cm2 in severe MR (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We compared our results with outflow tract flow in 10 patients with isolated valvular aortic stenosis, (AS) and with those in 10 healthy volunteers. In HCM, a 94- to 145-degree angle (mean 111.4 +/- 11.9 degrees) developed between the direction of left ventricular outflow tract flow acceleration and aortic valve outflow, resulting in posterolaterally directed left ventricular outflow jets. The angle of the outflow jet and the peak velocity of the jet measured with continuous wave Doppler (as an indicator of the severity of obstruction) correlated well (r = -0.81, SEE = 7.8 degrees). Jet narrowing during ejection measured just proximal to the point of systolic anterior motion was 42 +/- 11% in HCM and was weakly correlated with peak jet velocity (r = 0.61, SEE = 8.9 degrees). Aliasing of left ventricular outflow occurred proximal to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and color M-mode demonstrated temporal and spatial flow acceleration proximal to systolic anterior motion, providing evidence for obstruction at that site. In AS, left ventricular outflow tract jets were more parallel to the axis of aortic outflow (129 to 153 degree, 138.4 +/- 8.1 degrees). Jet narrowing was only 8 +/- 5% compared to HCM (both p less than 0.05), and flow acceleration occurred proximal to the stenotic valve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diameter of the AoR was measured in two groups by means of two-dimensional echocardiography. Group A consisted of 138 normal subjects, aged 3 weeks to 20 years (mean 7.5 years). Group B consisted of 28 patients with fixed subaortic stenosis, aged 1.5 to 18 years (mean 9.5 years), 21 of whom had undergone surgical resection of the stenosis. Normal values and growth curves for AoR diameter were obtained from patients in group A. There was marked retardation of growth of the AoR among patients in group B, with seven patients having a small AoR diameter (less than 2 standard deviations). Postoperative gradients had a high correlation with the small size of diameter of the AoR (r = -0.84). In fixed subaortic stenosis the AoR may be small (25%). The presence of a small AoR has a marked effect on the optimal relief of fixed subaortic stenosis. The diameter of the AoR should be measured preoperatively, inasmuch as special surgical techniques may be required.\r"

One patient died of constrictive pericarditis despite pericardiectomy, and one died of acute bronchopneumonia after 8 months of otherwise successful medical management. All 14 long-term survivors were reevaluated to exclude chronic constrictive pericarditis and other potential sequelae of tuberculous pericarditis. Reevaluation included physical examination, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiogram, computed tomography (CT) scan, and in patients less than or equal to 75 years of age, incremental cycle exercise to maximum oxygen consumption. None were found to have chronic constrictive pericarditis or convincing evidence of other recognized complications of tuberculous pericarditis. Our results suggest that when pericardiectomy is not required for the relief of cardiac compression during the acute phase of tuberculous pericarditis and patients are treated with medical therapy alone, an excellent long-term outcome may be anticipated.\r"

There was no difference in the 6- and 12-month mortality between the patients with primary VF and the reference group (3.7 vs 2.7% and 4.1 vs 4.2%, respectively). Survival of the 2 groups was also similar when patients were stratified according to infarct site (anterior and posterior), and whether or not they received treatment with streptokinase during AMI. Thus, long-term mortality of patients discharged alive after AMI complicated by primary VF is low and is not influenced by previous fibrinolytic therapy or by infarct site. The excess mortality of patients with primary VF is confined to the hospital phase, after which survivors represent a low-risk subgroup.\r"

A majority (111 or 58%) used a low-level testing protocol, 50 (26%) used symptom-limited testing and 32 (16%) used both types. Testing was routinely conducted less than or equal to 14 days after AMI by 147 (76%) respondents, whereas 46 (24%) tested 15 to 28 days after AMI. Thirty-three (17%) respondents used a standardized research protocol and 160 (83%) did not. There were 41 (0.03%) fatal, 141 (0.09%) major nonfatal and 2,124 (1.4%) other cardiac complications reported during testing. No difference in incidence of major complications was observed at centers using a clinical versus research protocol. Compared with clinic-based testing, hospital-based testing had an increased risk for all major (2.1) and nonfatal major complications (2.1). Although a symptom-limited protocol increased the overall risk for major cardiac complications by 1.9 times compared with a low-level protocol, the incidence of fatal complications during symptom-limited testing (0.03%) was quite low and this greater risk is of dubious clinical importance.\r"

The main differences in the coronary vasomotor reaction were uniform vasodilatation in Prinzmetal's angina and a variable response to syndrome X, and a greater increase in the coronary lumen in patients with Prinzmetal's angina as compared with those with syndrome X who showed vasodilatation. The variable response in syndrome X was not related to changes in diastolic pressure and cardiac output. Patients showing coronary constriction were those who responded to nifedipine with a higher degree of tachycardia, which might suggest a neural participation in the paradoxic reaction to this drug. In the Prinzmetal group, on the contrary, at a similar heart rate increase the pattern was invariably vasodilatation. Thus, calcium ions appear to have a different role in the coronary smooth muscle contractility of the 2 series of patients; in fact, in Prinzmetal's angina nifedipine relaxed the coronary arteries to a greater degree and made them unresponsive to stimuli that were still able to cause vasoconstriction in patients with syndrome X.\r"

Patients received 1 to 2 weeks of placebo run-in, then 5 weeks of treatment with placebo and with 10, 20 and 30 mg of nicardipine given 3 times daily. Patients completed symptom diaries, were monitored with 24-hour electrocardiographic Holter monitors and underwent serial exercise treadmill tests. By 1 hour, 10, 20 and 30 mg of nicardipine administered 3 times daily produced statistically significant, dose-related improvements in all key exercise parameters, which persisted at the 4-hour evaluation. The systolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise decreased, but the pulse slightly increased. The peak rate-pressure product was unchanged. The side effects were not severe. Nicardipine hydrochloride is an effective, well-tolerated medication for the treatment of stable exertional angina, and is a good alternative to currently available calcium antagonists.\r"

QRS amplitude measurements were performed manually at both the PR and shifted J-ST baselines at 10-second intervals during these periods to determine that baseline from which the R and S waves most nearly maintained their control amplitudes. There was no significant baseline relation for either the R or the S waves in leads V2 and V5 during ischemia. However, the R-wave changes in lead aVF were significantly associated with the PR- versus the J-ST-segment baseline (p = 0.007); the S wave, when it occurred, had no tendency for either baseline. The electrocardiographic records were also examined visually for characteristics of left posterior (inferior) \"periischemic block\" likely to occur uniquely in patients with a dominant right or left circumflex occlusion.

Plasma triglyceride concentrations were in the normal range for all persons in both groups. Analysis of lipoproteins of density less than 1.063 g/ml was carried out by analytical ultracentrifugation. The analytical pattern gave the peak Sf for LDL as well as an indication of heterogeneity of particle sizes in the density range of LDL. In both normal subjects and patients with coronary artery disease, a positive correlation was found between peak Sf for LDL and concentrations of plasma triglycerides. Plasma triglyceride levels also were correlated positively with concentrations of Sf 20 to 60 lipoproteins and total IDL mass, and inversely with HDL cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the value for peak Sf for LDL correlated inversely with the IDL mass concentration and IDL/LDL mass ratio, and positively with the HDL cholesterol levels. The results indicate that the lipoprotein pattern, including lipoprotein concentrations and particle sizes, is sensitive to concentrations of plasma triglycerides even when the latter are within the normal range.\r"

Both groups received low incremental doses of NE: 15, 30 and 60 ng/kg/min for 8 minutes each. In contrast to previous studies that compared the dose-response curves in normo- and hypertensive subjects, this study corrected the cardiovascular responses for the increment of plasma NE to account for differences in metabolic clearance of NE. Although age and sex appeared to play a role, the corrected cardiovascular responses did not differ significantly between normo- and hypertensive subjects. Thus, an increased cardiovascular sensitivity to exogenous NE was not demonstrated in mildly hypertensive subjects. This finding confirms some but not all previous studies of the dose-response relation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a single dose of isosorbide-5-mononitrate on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function was assessed by radionuclide ventriculography in 18 hypertensive patients. The effect of the mononitrate on atrial filling also was assessed. As expected, there was a significant decrease in mean blood pressure (120 +/- 17 to 102 +/- 18 mm Hg, p less than 0.005). Global LV ejection fraction did not show a significant change, increasing slightly from 64 +/- 9 to 68 +/- 8% (difference not significant). The mononitrate prolonged the time to peak filling rate from 176 +/- 36 to 195 +/- 29 ms (p less than 0.0001). The percentage of time to peak filling rate from diastole also increased, from 46 to 53% (p less than 0.05), whereas the normalized peak filling rate did not change (2.36 +/- 0.6 to 2.31 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic volumes/s, difference not significant). This effect on LV diastolic function was closely related to a certain reduction in preload, as suggested by the reduction in mean left atrial filling (45 +/- 12 to 40 +/- 13 counts/s, p less than 0.005) and LV diastolic counts, suggesting that the \"impairment\" of diastolic function induced by nitrates is secondary to the reduction in venous return to the left atrium. The mononitrate did not affect the mean right atrial filling rate (50 +/- 12 to 52 +/- 13 counts/s) and the right ventricular end-diastolic counts, suggesting a primary vasodilatory effect of nitrates on the pulmonary vascular bed.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty opiate addicts were studied at necropsy. Fifty-nine patients had anatomic evidence of active infective endocarditis (IE); 11 had healed IE; and 10 had both. Of the 80 patients, the first episode of IE involved a single right-sided cardiac valve in 24 patients (30%); both a right- and a left-sided valve in 13 patients (16%); a single left-sided valve in 33 patients (41%); and both left-sided valves in 10 patients (13%). Of the 320 cardiac valves in the 80 patients, 103 were sites of vegetations, an average of 1.3 of the 4 valves. Of the 80 patients, the tricuspid valve was infected in 35 (44%), mitral in 34 (43%), aortic in 32 (40%) and pulmonic in 2 (3%). Of the 103 infected cardiac valves, the infection caused sufficient damage to cause dysfunction in 70 (68%): in 28 (88%) of 32 infected aortic valves; in 22 (63%) of 35 infected tricuspid valves; in 19 (56%) of the 34 infected mitral valves; and in 1 of the 2 infected pulmonic valves. Of the 80 patients, 57 (71%) had sufficient valvular damage to cause valvular dysfunction. Of the 80 patients, gross examination of the valves at necropsy indicated that the infected valve almost certainly had been anatomically normal in 65 patients (81%) and abnormal in 15 patients (19%) before the onset of IE. Of the 65 patients with previously anatomically normal valves, 86 (33%) of their 260 cardiac valves were sites of infection (average 1.3 valves/patient); of the 15 patients with infection superimposed on a previously abnormal valve, the infection in each involved previously abnormal valves (21 in the 15 patients) or 17 (28%) of their 60 cardiac valves were sites of infection (average 1.1 valve/patient). Of the 15 patients with abnormal cardiac valves before the infection, 7 had congenitally bicuspid aortic valves and 8 had diffuse fibrous thickening of the mitral valve typical of rheumatic heart disease with (6 patients) or without (2 patients) diffuse fibrous thickening of tricuspid aortic valves. Of the 80 patients, 42 (53%) died during their first episode of active IE, 17 (21%) underwent operative excision with or without valve replacement during the active IE, and in 21 patients (26%) the first episode of active IE healed. In 10 of the latter 21 patients, active IE recurred and was fatal. A total of 19 patients had cardiac valve excision with or without replacement, 17 during active IE and 2 after healing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) often show substantial increases in left ventricular (LV) wall thickness or even de novo development of LV hypertrophy during childhood. To determine the utility of the electrocardiogram in reflecting such changes in LV mass, serial 12-lead electrocardiograms and 2-dimensional echocardiograms were analyzed in 38 children with HC. The period of evaluation ranged from 3 to 8 years (mean 5.5). Between the initial and most recent clinical evaluations, precordial and standard lead voltages did not change significantly in the study patients, including those showing evolution of LV hypertrophy by 2-dimensional echocardiography; furthermore, only 9 of the 38 patients (23%) showed any substantial change in the overall electrocardiographic pattern. However, the magnitude of electrocardiographic voltages at initial evaluation (age 11 +/- 4 years) showed a significant correlation with the extent of LV hypertrophy at the most recent evaluation as assessed by echocardiography (at age 16 +/- 4 years) (r = 0.65, p less than 0.001). Of note, each of the 7 patients who developed LV hypertrophy during the period of observation had distinct electrocardiographic abnormalities at the initial evaluation that preceded the appearance of LV hypertrophy on the echocardiogram. In conclusion, in children with HC and evolving LV hypertrophy, the electrocardiogram showed little change during the period of observation. However, electrocardiographic abnormalities may be the initial manifestation of HC, appearing even before LV hypertrophy is detectable by echocardiography. Hence, in patients with HC the electrocardiogram may provide advance evidence of morphologic changes that will subsequently occur and may describe the magnitude of LV hypertrophy ultimately achieved an average of 5 years later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Chlamydia trachomatis infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Developing methods to identify patients who are at higher risk would enable clinicians to perform selective testing for C. trachomatis infection, which may reduce morbidity, sequelae, and overall costs. Risk factors for C. trachomatis infection of the cervix in women seen for routine gynecologic care were therefore analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Extensive clinical data and cervical cultures were obtained from 1,141 women between the ages of 18 and 50. Multivariate techniques were used to develop and prospectively test a model to predict infection. RESULTS: In the model development series of 530 patients seen in a hospital-based practice, 24 (4.5%) had a positive culture result. In the validation series of 611 patients seen in private practice, 17 (2.8%) had positive culture results. The majority of infected patients (61%) were asymptomatic. For sexually active women 18 to 35 years of age, the optimal predictive model was based on three factors: level of education (high school or less), a sex partner with other partners during the prior three months, and endocervical bleeding induced by the initial swab. In the validation series, the prevalence of infection for women with one or more of these factors was 5.8% (95% confidence interval, 4.0 to 8.6) compared with 0.9% in patients without these factors (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Clinical information can be used in a low-prevalence population to predict a patient's risk for C. trachomatis infection and to select patients for testing.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: AIDS patients identified at Bellevue Hospital between August 1985 and May 1986, who had abnormal computed tomographic scans of the brain and who received empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis, constitute the empirically treated cohort. A cohort with biopsy-proven toxoplasmosis was identified from Bellevue Hospital neuropathology records spanning 1981 through 1986. Patient records were reviewed with a standardized data form, and tomograms were evaluated by neuroradiologists unaware of the identity of the scans. Survival analysis was performed by the product limit method. RESULTS: Of 38 empirically treated patients, 26 responded clinically and radiographically within four weeks of initiation of therapy. Four of nine patients who underwent biopsy responded to treatment. There was no difference in these response rates (68% versus 44%, p = 0.24). The median survival of the empirically treated responders, from first diagnosis of AIDS to last follow-up, was 422 days. Among the 30 responders, five patients discontinued therapy and four of them had relapses. No relapses occurred in the 25 patients who continued full-dose therapy indefinitely (p = 0.0004). Sixteen of 30 patients (53%) receiving continuous therapy developed toxicity, which required a change in medication. There was no difference in the survival of patients who continued to receive sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine compared with those in whom clindamycin was substituted for sulfadiazine (median, 311 days versus 422 days, p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: A policy of empiric treatment of suspected Toxoplasma encephalitis is satisfactory, and patients who respond to such therapy and continue to take full therapeutic doses of anti-Toxoplasma drugs have relatively long survivals.\r"

The purpose of this retrospective study was two-fold: (1) to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of cerebral infarction and transient neurologic deficits (TNDs) among patients with AIDS; and (2) to identify specific patient subgroups at risk for such complications and whether there were underlying associated diseases requiring specific therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Neurology inpatient and consult service records, neuropathology reports, and the University of California, San Francisco, AIDS computerized registry were used in identifying study cases. Information on demographic background, associated clinical diagnoses, presenting neurologic symptoms and signs, laboratory results, pathologic findings, and clinical follow-up was obtained from each patient's medical record. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with AIDS (mean age, 38) having clinical or pathologic findings suggestive of focal cerebral ischemia or infarction were identified. Ten patients had non-hemorrhagic cerebral infarctions, 13 had acute TNDs, and two had both. Cerebral infarction was associated with central nervous system (CNS) infections (cryptococcus, four; tuberculosis, one; zoster vasculitis, one) and cardiogenic embolism (one). TNDs were associated with toxoplasmosis (four), cerebral infarction (two), cryptococcal meningitis (one), vasculitis (one), and CNS Kaposi's sarcoma (one). A presumptive cause was absent in five cases of cerebral infarction and eight of TND. All five patients with pathologically proven macroscopic cerebral infarcts were diagnosed clinically before death. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude the following: (1) AIDS patients, especially given their young age, appear to be increased risk for cerebral infarction and TND. (2) Cerebral infarction and TND may be the initial presentation of AIDS. (3) TND and cerebral infarction often signify treatable CNS infection among AIDS patients. (4) The causes of AIDS-related cerebral infarction and TND are unknown in many cases.\r"

Nine patients with features of papillary stenosis and sclerosing cholangitis and one patient with primary bile duct lymphoma were previously described. Since those reports, an additional 16 AIDS patients with clinical and laboratory features suggestive of biliary tract disease have been evaluated. The findings in these 26 patients form the basis of this study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients, 25 men and one woman, with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fevers, or elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, or any combination of the three symptoms, underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and ampullary biopsy. RESULTS: Twenty of these 26 (77%) patients were found to have markedly abnormal cholangiograms. Four patterns of cholangiographic abnormalities were identified: sclerosing cholangitis and papillary stenosis (10 patients), papillary stenosis alone (three patients), sclerosing cholangitis alone (four patients), and long extrahepatic bile duct strictures (three patients). An AIDS-associated pathogen or malignancy was identified in 11 patients (55%), with cytomegalovirus being the most common (five patients). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were not significantly different between AIDS patients with cholangiopathy and those without cholangiopathy. However, 15 of 20 patients with cholangiographic abnormalities (versus only one of six patients without such abnormalities) had ductal dilation on ultrasound or computed tomography, or both. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware that profound biliary tract abnormalities may develop in a large number of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Confirmation of the anatomic abnormalities, determination of correct etiology, and effective therapy may depend upon early endoscopic cholangiography.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Cocaine abuse has recently emerged as a major problem among young adults, and is increasingly associated with a variety of medical complications. In view of recent reports demonstrating that illicit cocaine use may cause rhabdomyolysis, we reviewed the collective experience of a university-affiliated medical center to identify patients with cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among hospital admissions due to acute cocaine abuse during the period June 1987 through June 1988, we identified seven patients who exhibited biochemical evidence of skeletal muscle injury. Six of these patients presented within one hour of free-basing cocaine with complaints of thoracic skeletal muscle pain. Hospital admission was prompted by the suspicion of myocardial ischemia or infarction. The remaining patient was incidentally found to have an elevated serum level of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) after abusing cocaine and was hospitalized to exclude a cardiac origin. RESULTS: Serum CPK levels in the seven patients rose to a mean peak value of 16.1 +/- 3.6 mu kat/L, and returned toward normal within 72 hours. A cardiac origin for the elevated CPK values was excluded by negative results of determinations of CPK-MB fractions. CONCLUSION: Rhabdomyolysis must be added to the every-growing list of medical complications associated with the illicit use of cocaine. Skeletal muscle injury may be a more common complication of cocaine abuse than has previously been appreciated, escaping medical attention when the clinical manifestations are relatively mild. The importance of recognizing this clinical entity lies in the potential confusion with myocardial ischemia. This point is illustrated by the fact that each of our patients was hospitalized to exclude the possibility of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. Cardiac ischemia could not be differentiated from skeletal muscle injury solely on the basis of clinical assessment.\r"

We have previously reported that interferon-alpha can control severe refractory thrombocytosis in patients with advanced chronic myelogenous leukemia. Therefore, we treated a group of thrombocythemic patients with Ph-negative myeloproliferative disorders, including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, with recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha 2a). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight patients with profound elevations in platelet counts received a median induction dose of 5.4 X 10(6) U/day (range, 5.0 to 10.0 X 10(6) U/day) of rIFN-alpha 2a administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. RESULTS: We observed a significant decline in platelet counts from a median baseline value of 1,929 X 10(9)/L (range, 960 to 2,960 X 10(9)/L) to a median posttreatment value of 431 X 10(9)/L (range, 71 to 1,150 X 10(9)/L) (p less than 0.01). Concomitantly, white blood cell counts declined from a median baseline value of 20.8 X 10(9)/L (range, 10.5 to 40.8 X 10(9)/L) to a median posttreatment value of 6.1 X 10(9)/L (range, 2.9 to 29.0 X 10(9)/L) (p less than 0.02). Correction of thrombocytosis was rapid, with a median of only eight days from the start of therapy to the achievement of a platelet count less than 1,000 X 10(9)/L. Six of eight patients have shown an ongoing response with a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, one to 30 months). There have been no bleeding or thrombotic events during the study. Side effects of rIFN-alpha 2a therapy consisted of fever and flu-like symptoms, with tachyphylaxis developing after one to two weeks of therapy. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that alpha interferon may be a promising therapeutic agent for myeloproliferative disorders characterized by thrombocytosis.\r"

When of known cause, needlesticks were most common during blood drawing and recapping (52.0%, 13 of 25). Small offices more often recapped needles, but only metropolitan small offices reported more frequent injuries. Only 37.6% of offices used a protocol for management of injuries, and in less than half (45.4%) was physician evaluation routine. Although most offices used plastic containers and a majority (73.0%) incinerated or autoclaved needles prior to disposal, small offices more often disposed of sharps in their routine solid waste. Larger metropolitan offices more consistently followed current recommendations for handling and disposing of needles. There is a need for education efforts to address these issues for physicians and their office staff.\r"

The women were in active labor and under epidural anesthesia at the time Doppler measurements were made. There was a significant positive relationship between end-diastolic flow velocity and fetal heart rate. The umbilical artery peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratio was best correlated with the negative reciprocal transformation of the instantaneous fetal heart rate value and end-diastolic flow velocity. No significant correlation was found between fetal heart rate, umbilical artery peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratio, and peak-systolic flow velocity. An upper limit of 3.0 for a normal umbilical artery peak-systolic/end-diastolic ratio was acceptable only if the instantaneous fetal heart rate was greater than or equal to 130 beats/min.\r"

Cysts were identified by the transformation of mural granulosa cells into epithelial cells. The invaginations of the basal plasma membrane of the epithelial cells of the cyst are thought to be indications of the cells' involvement in active endocytosis. This endocytosis may be one strategy for moving fluid into the cyst. The filamentous actin of granulosa cells cultured in the presence of 10(-5) mol/L dehydroepiandrosterone was found to be deficient when compared with that of controls. This lack of filamentous actin coupled with other organelle degeneration is believed to lead to early atresia of granulosa cells in vitro in the presence of high concentrations of androgens.\r"

One radionuclide that has been generated and tested in our laboratory in vitro and in vivo is lead 212 (212Pb). Intraperitoneal instillation of 212Pb prolonged survival and totally eradicated tumor in 24% of mice inoculated with the extremely virulent Ehrlich ascites-producing tumor. In vitro 212Pb was two to four times more effective in killing human ovarian cancer cells than x-rays. Irradiation with 212Pb increased the radiosensitivity and chromosomal aberrations of cells. In dogs, intraperitoneal instillation of 2.6 mCi of ferrous hydroxide tagged with 212Pb caused no significant toxicity. It appears that alpha-emitting radionucides such as 212Pb have the potential to be a new and potent treatment of ovarian carcinoma and could be effective in cases that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy or x-ray therapy.\r"

We have used molecular analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid to study the occurrence of spontaneous human germinal mutations. We examined 458 offspring and parents in 60 multigeneration human families. Probes for hypervariable loci were dispersed throughout all chromosomes to note the occurrence of new mutations. We found that both point mutations and insertion-deletion mutations occur frequently enough to be directly quantitated. The rates of occurrence detected at the molecular level are much greater than the rates detected with other modalities. The mutational rates at some loci approach 1% in live-born children. Such mutations appear to be sequence specific and related to the processes of meiosis or mitosis as they occur in the production of human gametes.\r"

Between 1981 and 1988, 266 patients were randomly assigned to either oral contraceptives or barrier contraception after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole. Patients were followed up until serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin were normal or until specific criteria for the diagnosis of postmolar trophoblastic disease were met. Twenty-three percent of patients receiving oral contraceptives had postmolar trophoblastic disease, whereas those using a barrier method had a rate of 33%. The median time to spontaneous regression in the oral contraceptives group was 9 weeks, whereas the median time to regression in the barrier group was 10 weeks. Twice as many patients in the barrier group became pregnant in the immediate follow-up period. We conclude that oral contraceptives are the preferred method of contraception after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole.\r"

Doxyrubicin liposomes were prepared with cardiolipin, phosphatidyl choline, cholesterol, and sterarylamine and sized by flow cytometry before administration. Fifteen patients have been treated with 42 cycles of intraperitoneal liposome-encapsulated doxrubicin. Liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin in 2 L of normal saline solution was infused over 1 hour through an infusaport into the peritoneal cavity with a dwell time of 4 hours every 21 days. Liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin has been administered at escalating doses up to 100 mg/2 L and has been well tolerated. Increased bowel motility with mild-to-moderate abdominal distress has been encountered during the first 24 hours after administration. There has been one patient with presumed chemically induced peritonitis after a temperature elevation to 39.5 degrees C. There has been no myelosuppression, abnormalities of liver function tests, or alopecia. Nausea and vomiting were minimal. Liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin was extravasated in two patients without sequelae. Drug levels were measured after completion of infusion. At a dose of 70 mg, the peak intraperitoneal concentration was 28.6 micrograms/microliter, which was reduced to 23.6 micrograms/microliter by 2 hours. Concurrent plasma levels were in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 micrograms/microliter. A similar pattern was observed at other doses. The maximum tolerable dose has not yet been obtained. There were three responders in the 10 evaluable patients. The preliminary experience with intraperitoneal liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is encouraging.\r"

Half of the lambs had hemoglobin-oxygen affinity reduced acutely by isovolemic exchange transfusion with fresh adult whole blood; the other half served as controls. In both groups of fetuses, we measured fetal oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, and acid-base state at normal fetal hematocrit levels and during reductions in the hematocrit level of 30% (moderate anemia) and 60% (severe anemia) produced by isovolemic exchange transfusions with plasma. At normal fetal hematocrit levels, reductions in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity had no effect on fetal oxygen consumption or acid-base state. During moderate anemia, fetal oxygen delivery decreased in both series of fetuses, but oxygen consumption and base excess fell only in those fetuses whose circulations contained adult hemoglobin. During severe anemia, oxygen consumption and base excess decreased in both groups of fetuses, although these changes were more pronounced in fetuses with adult hemoglobin than in those with fetal hemoglobin. Our data indicate that, even though a high hemoglobin-oxygen affinity may not be essential to a healthy fetus, it is critical for normal metabolism in a fetus subjected to a hypoxic stress such as anemia.\r"

The positive predictive value of the Creasy et al. system was 18.3%. With multiple logistic analyses we excluded infrequent risk factors and identified five factors that remained significant (prepregnancy weight less than 45.5 kg, black race, single marital status, one preterm labor and delivery, preterm labor, and delivery greater than or equal to 2). With these five risk factors we created an equation that allowed identification of 12% of patients at high risk of preterm delivery with a positive predictive value of 21.9%. Because of the importance of previous preterm delivery, risk scoring of primigravid patients is of limited value.\r"

  ".U": "89225969\r", 
  ".W": "The uterine response to adrenergic stimulation is determined by the hormonal milieu. This response is particularly well characterized in the rabbit. In this species, as in humans, the response of the uterus to sympathetic stimulation is alpha-adrenergically mediated contraction with elevated circulating estrogen. However, with progesterone predominance, similar stimulation inhibits uterine contractions, a response mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors acting through their second message, cyclic adenosine monophosphate. We studied the mechanisms by which sex steroids regulate myometrial adrenergic responses. In this study, we questioned whether part of the effect of sex steroids could be explained by an alteration of the coupling of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. We found that in the progesterone-treated rabbit, although alpha 2-receptors are present, they are not linked to inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis. The net synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphage in response to endogenous catecholamines is determined by their activation of beta-adrenergic receptors to increase and alpha 2-receptors to decrease cyclic adenosine monophosphate formation. Thus the uncoupling of alpha 2-receptors contributes to increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate in myometrium of progesterone-treated animals consistent with the reported predominance of beta-adrenergic contractile responses in this setting.\r"

In contrast, women with a flat perineum who lack labia majora, labia minora, and vaginal introitus have no alternative to development of a vagina-like orifice other than surgical vaginoplasty. This study addresses the anatomic and functional success rate of these women after undergoing modified McIndoe technique. Thirty-four patients with microphallus were assigned the female gender as the sex of rearing at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1951 and 1987. A majority of patients underwent surgical revision of the external genitalia and gonadectomy before 2 years of age. Family counseling was begun at birth. Of these patients, 15 (17 to 25 years old) who requested the ability to have sexual relations underwent modified McIndoe vaginoplasty. All 15 of these women have experienced satisfactory coitus. All but one patient have an adequate size vagina. Results of this group indicate that patients with ambiguous genitalia as a result of male hermaphroditism or microphallus can achieve functional success after vaginal creation with a modified McIndoe technique despite the presence of a flat perineum.\r"

To develop a brief questionnaire appropriate for office detection of \"risk-drinking,\" that is, alcohol intake potentially sufficient to damage the fetus, defined here as greater than or equal to 1 ounce of absolute alcohol per day, we obtained a quantitative drinking history at the first prenatal visit from 971 consecutive gravid women who admitted ever having drunk alcohol. In addition, we administered the 25-question Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test and the four CAGE questions (C = cut down, A = annoyed, G = guilt, E = eye opener), a screening test previously unstudied in pregnancy, and sought evidence of tolerance to the inebriating effect of alcohol, a question which does not appear to trigger psychologic denial. The patient was considered tolerant if it took greater than 2 drinks to make her feel \"high.\" Among 42 (4.3%) risk-drinkers and 929 women who did not report drinking at risk levels, four questions were found to contribute to reliably differentiating risk-drinkers from non-risk-drinkers (R2 = 14.6%, p less than 0.0001). The probability of risk-drinking increased from 1.5% for those responding negatively to 62.7% for those responding positively to all four questions (T = tolerance, A = annoyed, C = cut down, E = eye-opener; odds ratio = 109X). A simple scoring scheme (2 points for T and 1 each for A, C, or E, with a total score of greater than or equal to 2 considered positive) correctly identified 69% of the risk-drinkers (sensitivity) with a positive predictive value of 23%). The T-ACE questions take about 1 minute to ask and represent the first validated sensitive screen for risk-drinking appropriate for routine use in obstetric-gynecologic practice. If validated in further samples, broad application might contribute to better risk identification, secondary prevention efforts, and improved pregnancy outcomes for offspring at risk from heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.\r"

Eighty-seven patients underwent transabdominal chorionic villus sampling between 9 and 12 menstrual weeks of pregnancy. Sufficient chorionic villi (greater than or equal to 5 mg) were obtained from 83 of the 87 patients (95.4%); in 73 (88%) of the 83 successful samplings only a single needle passage was required. In one case a 47,XX, +21 complement was diagnosed; the patient elected to terminate the pregnancy and the diagnosis was confirmed in the abortus. In a second case a 46,XX,rcp(15;21)(p11;q21) woman had a fetus who also had the same balanced translocation. In a third case nonmosaic 47,XX, +16 was detected in both direct preparations of cytotrophoblast cells and cultured mesenchymal core cells. Amniocentesis performed at 15 weeks showed a normal 46,XX complement. The pregnancy continued, and the patient was delivered at term of a healthy female infant. Two spontaneous fetal losses occurred in this series, and one woman underwent an elective abortion after receiving the results of a 46,XX complement. To date, 39 of the women have been delivered and all infants are doing well; the remaining 44 pregnancies are continuing uneventfully. We conclude that transabdominal chorionic villus sampling can be a useful alternative to transcervical chorionic villus sampling, particularly when transcervical sampling is contraindicated (e.g., active genital herpes) or where the transcervical approach would be technically difficult.\r"

Patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy but with maintenance of at least 95% of prepregnancy body weight were in group B (n = 34). Infants in group A were significantly smaller with respect to average birth weight expressed as a percentile for gestational age: 38.11 percentile, versus 72.00 percentile for group B (p less than 0.025). Macrosomia (greater than or equal to 4000 gm) was significantly associated with group B (18% versus group A, 0%; p less than 0.025). Growth retardation (less than or equal to 10th percentile weight at birth) was significantly associated with group A (30% versus group B, 6%; p less than 0.01). Three integumentary system abnormalities (3 of 30 cases) occurred in group A compared with none in group B. Although hyperemesis gravidarum has been viewed as a positive predictor, those patients who also demonstrate weight loss and electrolyte disturbance may be a distinct entity and at greater risk for growth retardation and fetal anomalies.\r"

This has led to the recommendation that when human papillomavirus infections are identified on the cervix, especially in association with dysplasia, these patients should have colposcopic assessment and treatment. The natural history of cervical human papillomavirus infections, particularly when associated with mild or moderate dysplasia, is not clear. To assess this question, 235 women with mild to moderate cervical dysplasia associated with a human papillomavirus infection were prospectively evaluated at 6-month intervals by the Colposcopy Clinic. This review suggests that mild to moderate cervical dysplasia associated with human papillomavirus infection eventually spontaneously disappears or, at worse, lingers on over many months in a mild to moderate form. These observations do not support the current popular practice of treating all mild to moderate cervical dysplasias associated with human papillomavirus infection or cervical human papillomavirus infection not associated with dysplastic lesions.\r"

After cesarean delivery each neonatal lamb was studied at 2 and 24 hours of age. Blood flow to the cerebral hemispheres and adrenal glands decreased progressively after birth and correlated inversely with the postnatal rise in arterial oxygen content (r = -0.77, p less than 0.001 and r = -0.52, p less than 0.01, respectively). Blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys changed little despite the known increase in blood flow from the late fetal to the early neonatal period. Skeletal muscle and brown fat blood flow were both increased when measured at 2 hours after birth, with an even greater increase in their respective oxygen deliveries presumably reflecting their increased metabolic activity with thermogenesis at this time. Variable blood flow changes are thus evident over the immediate perinatal period. In some cases these changes reflect birth-related changes in either blood gases or functional activity whereas in others the changes simply reflect a continuum from the late fetal to the early neonatal period.\r"

Control measurements were made in four animals in which the vascular clamp was not adjusted. Fetal PaO2 fell from 20.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 16.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg within 1 hour after application of the clamp and remained suppressed during 48 hours. There was a transient acidemia at 1 to 2 hours that had corrected by 8 hours. Fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone levels rose from 24 +/- 6 to 1320 +/- 205 pg/ml at 2 hours but decreased by 16 hours. Measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, more than 95% of immunoreactivity corresponded to adrenocorticotropic hormone1-39. Fetal cortisol levels rose by 6 hours and remained elevated through 48 hours. Maternal adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and progesterone levels were unchanged during the study period. We conclude that fetal hypoxemia-acidemia after restriction of uterine blood flow provokes fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone release, but the elevation in adrenocorticotropic hormone is not sustained. However, the level of fetal cortisol rises progressively, consistent with fetal adrenal activation.\r"

Cytoplasmic human chorionic gonadotropin was detectable in all (100%) cells in culture when labeled with a polyclonal anti-human chorionic gonadotropin antibody and in 71% to 83% of cells labeled with a monoclonal anti-alpha-human chorionic gonadotropin antibody. Most of the cells expressed cytokeratin and surface Trop-1 and Trop-2 antigens (89% to 95%), but none expressed cytoplasmic vimentin or surface 63D3 antigens. Study of the ultrastructure of the cells demonstrated epithelial morphologic features. The average doubling time of the trophoblast was 48 to 96 hours. Some of the lines have been continuously propagated for 8 months. They produced variable amounts of human chorionic gonadotropin (50 to 710 mIU/ml per 10(5) cells per 24 hours). The basal level of progesterone secreted by trophoblast (444.4 +/- 32.4 pg/ml per 10(5) cells per 24 hours) doubled in the presence of pure human chorionic gonadotropin (100 ng/ml). They produced small amounts of 17 beta-estradiol (less than 20 pg/ml per 10(5) cells per 24 hours); human chorionic gonadotropin had no effect on the estradiol production. Trophoblast-derived human chorionic gonadotropin acted as a growth factor because trophoblast proliferation (measured by uptake of thymidine labeled with tritium) was reduced by 60% in the presence of an anti-human chorionic gonadotropin antibody. Availability of pure, functionally competent human cytotrophoblast in long-term cultures is relevant for further studies in reproduction biology.\r"

Results indicate that (1) human early pregnancy factor has a basic molecular weight of 14 kd, (2) early pregnancy factor has immunosuppressive activity, (3) polymers of early pregnancy factor also appear to be present in the embryo growth media, and (4) immunosuppressive factors other than early pregnancy factor are also secreted by preimplantation human embryos. Early pregnancy factor and other factor(s) produced by the preimplantation embryo may play a role in suppressing maternal cellular immune responses, thereby preventing maternal rejection of the embryo.\r"

We have examined the relationship between these hormones and systemic blood gas tensions and substrate concentrations in the perinatal period. Measurements were made in arterial blood of seven unanesthetized fetal sheep at 138 to 141 days' gestation during low- and high-voltage electrocortical activity. After cesarean delivery each newborn lamb was studied again at 2, 5, and 10 minutes and at 2 and 24 hours while awake. There was no correlation between fetal or maternal adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, or progesterone and fetal electrocortical activity. Within 2 to 5 minutes of delivery there was a dramatic increase in neonatal immunoreactive adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations associated with an increase in plasma cortisol. Neonatal Pao2 rose progressively, but a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis was evident during the first 10 minutes after delivery. This was partially corrected by 2 hours of neonatal life and was fully corrected by 24 hours of life. We conclude that rapid responsiveness of the fetal pituitary-adrenal axis occurs in response to birth in the absence of active labor, and we suggest that this may have survival value for the preterm fetus.\r"

Prostaglandin E2 is secreted by amnion and is present in amniotic fluid. This study measured prostaglandin E2 production by amnion from all three locations to determine the relative contributions of prostaglandin E2 to amniotic fluid at term. Total surface areas and weights of umbilical cord, basal placental plate, and reflected chorionic amnion were measured in afterbirths from 20 normal patients delivered at term by elective repeat cesarean section before the onset of labor or vaginally after spontaneous onset of labor. Subsequently, 2 cm lengths of umbilical cord and 8 cm2 disks of basal placental plate and reflected chorionic amnion were incubated in perfusion chambers, and prostaglandin E2 production was measured by radioimmunoassay. Umbilical cord accounted for the least surface area (16% to 17%) but greatest tissue mass (75% to 76%). Both basal placental plate and reflected chorionic amnion increased prostaglandin E2 production 2.3-fold and 4.1-fold, respectively, after labor versus before labor, whereas umbilical cord prostaglandin E2 output was unchanged. However, umbilical cord accounted for 66% and 44% of the total prostaglandin E2 output before labor (697 +/- 169 ng/hr) versus (1201 +/- 380 ng/hr) after labor. Thus, of the three amniotic locations, umbilical cord represents the principal site of prostaglandin E2 production within the gestational sac.\r"

Because hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian suppression has been associated with ovarian protection from the effects of chemotherapy and medroxyprogesterone acetate has been identified as a radiosensitizing agent, we explored the effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on a rat model with known radiation injury characteristics. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate or vehicle from day 22 to day 37 of life and were either irradiated or sham-irradiated on day 30 of life and then killed on day 44. Radiation with medroxyprogesterone acetate administration produced a greater loss in preantral and healthy control follicles than in control follicles. No suppression of luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone had occurred by day 30 but ovarian glutathione content was reduced. These findings indicate that the administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate with radiotherapy may enhance ovarian injury.\r"

Umbilical artery waveforms were measured with continuous wave ultrasonography during spontaneous accelerations of the fetal heart rate in 20 uncomplicated, near-term pregnancies. On average, an acceleration of 20 beats/min of fetal heart rate within an individual was associated with a reduction in the systolic/diastolic velocity ratio of 0.25. There was, however, considerable variability in the response, and in six patients the systolic/diastolic ratio actually increased with heart rate. We conclude that fetal heart accelerations within the normal range cause only small and variable changes in the systolic/diastolic ratio.\r"

Throughout the central 30 degrees of the retina, 20% of the normal number of cells were gone in locations with a 5-dB sensitivity loss, and 40% cell loss corresponded to a 10-dB decrease. There were some remaining ganglion cells in areas that had 0-dB sensitivity in the field test.\r"

When pressure-time relationships were determined in individual patients, the categorical group differences were not statistically significant.

Kestenbaum's number is the less precise measure, but it can be quickly and cheaply estimated even in dark brown eyes. The filter test requires a set of filters and at least one well-innervated iris sphincter. Kestenbaum's number can be measured without filters, but the iris sphincter and dilator muscles in both eyes must be normally innervated.\r"

The combination of male gender with axial myopia (greater than or equal to 25.00 mm), a history of lattice degeneration, or a history of retinal detachment in the fellow eye was a significant risk factor for the development of retinal detachment after YAG capsulotomy.\r"

Of the eyes that were completely attached posterior to the buckle at six months, 13 of the 20 (65%) remained attached at the last follow-up examination. Many patients who had visual acuities of 5/200 or better at six months experienced a progressive decrease in visual acuity over three years, primarily because of recurrent retinal detachments and corneal edema. A final visual acuity of 5/200 or better was obtained in only five of the 42 eyes (12%) at the last follow-up examination.\r"

Independent life events (those beyond the subject's control) were also more numerous and more severe among the patients. The larger number of events experienced by the patients was due to the more frequent occurrence of life stress in the month before the onset of panic disorder. Loss events had the strongest relationship to panic disorder.\r"

The differential effect of depression on cognitive performance between left- and right-hemisphere lesion groups could not be accounted for by demographic variables, neurological symptoms, lesion location, or lesion size. Poststroke major depression appeared to produce a decline in cognitive performance or dementia of depression that depended on the laterality of the lesion.\r"

The findings illustrate the bias in studying only patients who seek treatment, point to groups of persons who may need psychiatric help, and provide insight into the complex process of help seeking.\r"

The vectors were exophilic Anopheles sinensis (80%) and the endophilic and anthropophilic An. anthropophagus (20%). The first impregnation of the nets was in June 1985 and the second in April 1986. About 87% of the population slept under treated nets. The indoor vector density decreased by 93% and remained at the same level during the second year. During the second year the average monthly malaria incidence was 1.3% for January-June, a decrease of 74.6% as compared with pretreatment data, and 0.85% from July to December, a decrease of 92.7%. In April 1986 and April 1987, the treatment was extended to the whole Buji District, which has a total population of approximately 40,000.

Electron microscopic (EM) studies were performed to characterize the spirochetes. Material collected on swabs was used to inoculate pre-reduced media and to prepare smears for gram staining; the swabs were placed in fixative for EM study. After incubation, colonies containing fusiform bacilli were subcultured. The anaerobic gram-negative fusiform isolates were identified as Fusobacterium nucleatum using biochemical reactions, hemagglutination testing, and reaction of antigen preparations of the isolates and ATCC strains in serological tests with rabbit antisera. EM observations of negatively stained spirochetes revealed an 8-16-8 periplasmic flagellar arrangement. F. nucleatum and spirochetes may participate in the pathogenesis of this polymicrobic infection.\r"

Two monkeys had a transient lymphadenopathy in earlier stages. Two moribund animals showed lymphopenia. Although 3 of the VLIA inoculated monkeys had persistent low grade fever early in the infection, the animals became afebrile in the later stages. One VLIA inoculated animal had a prominent antibody response, which occurred 7 months after VLIA inoculation. The other 3 monkeys had a transient or poor antibody response in the later stages. These 3 animals revealed periodic VLIA antigenemia during the course of the experiment. A control monkey was killed 8 months after the last VLIA inoculated monkey succumbed and showed neither an antibody response nor evidence of antigenemia. VLIA-specific DNA could be directly detected in necropsy tissues of all 4 monkeys inoculated with VLIA using the polymerase chain reaction method. VLIA infection was identified in all 4 spleens, 2 of 4 livers, 1 of 2 kidneys, and all 3 brains tested from these 4 animals, but not in the tissues from the control monkey. The necropsy examination of the 4 VLIA inoculated animals revealed no opportunistic infections, acute inflammatory lesions, malignancy or cause of death other than VLIA infection. We believe that the VLIA caused a fatal systemic infection in these monkeys.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of detection of anti-dengue IgM by antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was investigated in dengue infections in a variety of clinical settings. Sera from uninfected controls were uniformly negative. Serial specimens from experimental and natural infections showed that viremia and fever terminated as anti-dengue IgM became detectable. Anti-dengue IgM appeared in most cases by the 3rd afebrile day of illness and declined to undetectable levels after 30-60 days. Assay sensitivity was 78% in admission sera (924/1,183; 95% CI = 75-81%) and 97% in paired sera (1,030/1,062; 95% CI = 96-98%) thus exceeding or matching the performance of the hemagglutination-inhibition assay. Measurement of the anti-dengue IgM to anti-Japanese encephalitis IgM ratio correctly identified all sera from 112 patients with strictly defined Japanese encephalitis and 98% (307/312; 95% CI = 96-99%) of sera from patients whose dengue infections were confirmed by virus isolation. Dengue infections could be classified as primary or secondary by determining the ratio of units of dengue IgM to IgG antibody. We propose that measurement of dengue and Japanese encephalitis IgM and IgG antibodies upon admission and discharge from hospital care should replace the hemagglutination inhibition assay as the standard dengue serologic technique in regions where these 2 viruses co-circulate.\r"

Two groups of dengue-immune sera were compared: 32 dengue antibody positive serum specimens from children who subsequently developed asymptomatic secondary dengue infections; and 9 dengue antibody positive serum specimens from children who subsequently developed severe symptomatic secondary dengue infections, 8 of which were clinically diagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Antibody-dependent enhancement of virus growth was quantitated by measurement of virus yields in supernatant fluids of normal human monocyte cultures that were infected with DEN-2 virus in the presence of undiluted test serum. Only 4 of 32 (12%) preinfection sera from asymptomatic children, but 6 of 9 (67%) preinfection sera from symptomatic children, had significant enhancing activity (P less than 0.001). High serum DEN-2 antibody dependent enhancing activity is a significant (relative risk = 6.2) risk factor for severe illness among children in a dengue hemorrhagic fever endemic region. Dengue antibodies can be neutralizing and therefore protective, or they can be enhancing and increase the risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever.\r"

Thirty-six of these patients underwent laparotomy and form the basis of this study. Compared with previously reported figures for blunt abdominal trauma, there was a high incidence of gastrointestinal injuries (67 percent). In addition, associated lumbar spine injuries were found in a large proportion of patients (19 percent, p less than 0.005). We found an increased risk of spinal injury in patients wearing a lap versus a three-point belt.\r"

We hypothesized that octreotide acetate (Sandostatin), a somatostatin analog, decreases the pancreatic flow rate through a peptide-mediated mechanism and alters pancreatic fluid composition by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase action and circulating peptide levels. To test this hypothesis, we collected pancreatic fluid from six patients (four with pancreatic fistulas and two with pancreatic drains after pancreatic resection). Pancreatic fluid volume and chloride, sodium, potassium, amylase, lipase, and bicarbonate levels were measured before and after octreotide acetate therapy. Octreotide acetate reduced pancreatic fluid output by a mean of 75 percent (p less than 0.05), increased chloride concentration by 21 percent (p less than 0.05), and reduced bicarbonate content by 45 percent (p less than 0.05). Sodium levels were unchanged, but the potassium concentration was increased by 14 percent (p less than 0.05). Total amylase and lipase production per 24 hours was decreased by 63 percent and 27 percent, respectively (differences not significant). Somatostatin may be useful in the treatment of established pancreatic fistulas and may be a useful prophylactic tool to prevent postoperative fistula formation.\r"

With the development of a regional trauma care system in Oregon, preventable trauma mortality should decrease. An effort was made to improve the quality of trauma care in Clatsop County, Oregon, a community of 30,000 people with 2 small rural hospitals. To obtain this goal, four steps were taken: (1) physician and nurse education was improved, (2) trauma protocols promoting prompt resuscitation and stabilization of patients were established, (3) regular trauma case reviews were conducted, and (4) emergency medical technician and prehospital management were coordinated. This study reviews the trail from sporadic, uncoordinated rural trauma care to the designation process.\r"

Complications occurred in 45 percent of patients after pouch construction and in 17 percent after ileostomy closure. One patient died from sepsis caused by an anastomotic leak after ileostomy closure. The most common complication was a pouch-anal anastomotic stricture (22 percent), and the complication with the greatest potential morbidity was pouch-anal dehiscence (8 percent), which was highly predictive of pouch failure. Functional results were assessed by questionnaire during the 3-month period after ileostomy closure in all 58 patients who successfully attained intestinal continuity. A second assessment was performed at 15 +/- 11 months after ileostomy closure in 52 patients whose continuity had been restored for longer than 3 months. In an overall assessment, 94 percent of all patients with restored intestinal continuity (73 percent of entire patient group) rated the pouch as being superior to a permanent ileostomy and 92 percent (71 percent of entire group) would go through another pouch procedure. These results support the continued recommendation of this procedure as an acceptable alternative to proctocolectomy and permanent ileostomy in patients with ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis.\r"

  ".W": "Interrupted aortic arch is a poor prognosis cardiac anomaly with nearly 100 percent mortality if not recognized and treated early. The associated intracardiac lesions often lead to death if only the arch defect is repaired. Several recent reports have described patients with interrupted aortic arch who were treated as infants by primary repair of the arch defect with simultaneous repair of the intracardiac lesions. The improved survival data from these series have been attributed to the simultaneous repair of both lesions. We report herein on nine patients with both interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect seen at Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle from 1979 to 1987. Three patients had partial expression of DiGeorge's syndrome. All patients underwent primary repair of the interrupted aortic arch with concomitant pulmonary artery banding during infancy (mean age 18 days, range 2 days to 4 months). Operative mortality was 11 percent (1 of 9 patients). Eight patients had eventual repair of the ventricular septal defect (mean age 18 months, range 6 to 29 months) with one death occurring at 5 months postoperatively (12 percent mortality). The overall mortality of these nine patients was 22 percent. Staged repair of interrupted aortic arch with associated ventricular septal defect can be performed with results comparable to simultaneous primary repair in infancy. The improved survival from either approach is more likely to be attributable to improved perioperative stabilization, particularly the use of prostaglandin E.\r"

Although tube thoracostomy is generally considered a limited intervention, 2 to 25 percent of patients who undergo this procedure develop infectious complications. To determine the incidence and risk factors for the development of empyema thoracis after tube thoracostomy, a retrospective study was undertaken. We found that the development of empyema thoracis was increased in patients whose pleural space was incompletely drained and whose thoracic catheters were in place for a prolonged period.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated atherosclerotic lesions of the common femoral artery, though uncommon, are frequently associated with disabling peripheral ischemic symptoms when compared with similar lesions in the superficial femoral artery since claudication involves the thigh and calf and usually limits walking distance to less than one block. From 1969 to 1987, 29 patients underwent common femoral endarterectomy with vein patch angioplasty for symptoms of disabling claudication in 17, rest pain in 6 and ischemic ulceration in 6 patients. Endarterectomy was confined to the common femoral artery in 10 patients whereas endarterectomy was carried into either or both the deep or superficial femoral arteries in 19 patients. There was one immediate failure, secondary to residual disease in the outflow tract. All patients were discharged with patent reconstructions. Amputations were avoided in the 12 patients with advanced ischemic symptoms. Patients were followed long-term. Three patients were lost to follow-up with patent repairs to that time. There was one late occlusion. The cumulative patency rate 5 years postoperatively was 94 percent. The only complication was aneurysmal dilatation of the end-arterectomy site in one patient.\r"

  ".W": "Six hundred twenty-six cases of breast cancer treated at the Mason Clinic during the period from January 1, 1977 to December 31, 1987 were retrospectively reviewed. The review included only tumors 2 cm or less in maximal diameter and sought to determine the degree of correlation between axillary lymph node metastases in each of the following: patient age, estrogen receptor status, tumor location, degree of histologic differentiation, and tumor size. Only tumor size correlated significantly with the incidence of axillary lymph node metastases (p = 0.000001). The degree of differentiation appeared to correlate with the incidence of lymph node involvement but was not statistically significant (p = 0.17). No other subset of the above factors could be identified in association with axillary lymph node metastases. Forty-five noninvasive tumors were encountered in this series; none were associated with axillary lymph node metastases. The findings of this review lend support to the importance of screening mammography in the detection of breast cancer.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we measured tumor-associated antigen using the squamous cell carcinoma radioimmunoassay in 103 patients with previously treated squamous cell head and neck tumors and 28 patients with known squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Increased squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels were found in 39 percent of patients with known tumors and in 19 percent of the patients with previous curative resection. The sensitivity of the assay limited its usefulness in predicting the presence of new and recurrent tumors.\r"

Fine-needle localization was recommended if one of the following criteria was present: (1) evidence of a mass, (2) microcalcifications, (3) architectural distortion. Of the 200 localizations, 192 specimen radiographs were analyzed: 186 contained the lesion, 6 (3 percent) missed the lesion. Forty-eight cancers were detected (24 percent). The reasons for biopsy were microcalcification, 61 percent; presence of a mass, 25 percent; abnormal architecture, 14 percent. Histologically the cancers included 38 invasive plus 10 in-situ tumors. The predominant histologic cell type was ductal in origin with only four having lobular characteristics. In the definitive treatment of these patients, pathologic findings of the lymph nodes showed 2 of the 38 were positive for metastases. In summary, the technique of preoperative needle localization in this series indicates a 93 percent success rate. An analysis of the surgical intervention indicates that conservative breast surgery is the treatment of choice. Another result is the detection of high-risk malignant lesions such as duct and lobular hyperplasia that require close follow-up.\r"

Guidelines for resuscitation and treatment are affected by absolute cutoffs in hemodynamic parameters. To determine the sensitivity of various strata of systolic blood pressure and heart rate in identifying patients with major thoracoabdominal hemorrhage, a 1-year retrospective review was conducted. A third of all patients presented to the emergency department with a normal blood pressure and over three-quarters attained a normal blood pressure during the emergency department evaluation. Although the sensitivity of vital signs in identifying this group of patients improved as the variance from normal increased, standard cutoffs were relatively insensitive. We conclude that normal postinjury vital signs do not predict the absence of potentially life-threatening hemorrhage and abnormal vital signs at any point after injury require investigation to rule out significant blood loss.\r"

The automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) offers protection against malignant ventricular arrhythmias and allows some patients to be managed without antiarrhythmic drugs. We reviewed our experience with the AICD to determine its safety and efficacy. Since June 1987, 24 patients (mean age 63 years) who survived out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia not associated with acute myocardial infarction had implantation of an AICD. None had inducible monomorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with ventricular aneurysm. Twenty-three had abnormal left ventricular function (mean ejection fraction 0.32). There were no operative deaths and three complications. At last follow-up (mean 8.9 months) 23 patients were alive. Eight patients had one or more AICD discharges associated with symptomatic or monitored cardiac arrest. AICD implantation can be performed with low risk and appears to be an effective alternative to antiarrhythmic therapy with toxic drugs.\r"

Healthy, nonsmoking, young adult volunteers who were seronegative to influenza A/Korea/82 (H3N2) virus were randomly assigned to breathe either filtered clean air (control group) or NO2 for 2 h/day for 3 consecutive days. The NO2 concentrations were 2 ppm (Year 1), 3 ppm (Year 2), and 1 or 2 ppm (Year 3). Live, attenuated cold-adapted (ca) influenza A/Korea/82 reassortant virus was administered intranasally to all subjects immediately after the second exposure. Only one of the 152 volunteers had any symptoms; this person had a low grade fever. Pulmonary function measurements and nonspecific airway reactivity to methacholine were unchanged after NO2 exposure, virus infection, or both. Infection was determined by virus recovery, a fourfold or greater increase in serum or nasal wash influenza-specific antibody titers, or both. The infection rates of the groups were 12/21 (2 ppm NO2) versus 15/23 (clean air) in Year 1, 17/22 (3 ppm NO2) versus 15/21 (clean air) in Year 2, and 20/22 (2 ppm) and 20/22 (1 ppm) versus 15/21 (clean air) in Year 3. Each group exposed to 1 or 2 ppm NO2 in the last year became infected more often (91%) than did the control group (71%), but the differences were not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effectiveness of this program was evaluated from the relapse rate after treatment in 2,776 men. Post-treatment follow-up averaged 23.5 months. Limited information on potential determinants of relapse was available for all subjects and more detailed information for subsets. The drug regimen was the major determinant of relapse. Age was not a determinant of relapse nor was primary resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antituberculosis drugs, which was infrequent. The initial extent and severity of disease had a direct relation with the risk of relapse. The risk of relapse was greatest during the first 3 yr after treatment but persisted for the duration of the observation period. Neither continued exposure to mine dust nor the presence of pre-existing silicosis were shown to be determinants of relapse. A 4.5-month, four-drug weekday regimen was identified as being particularly effective in this working population and may be suitable for use in other working populations in the developing world.\r"

Toxicity was assessed 12 wk after the initiation of treatment with azidothymidine. Study group patients were more likely than control subjects to be either black or Hispanic (75% versus 30%, p = 0.02). There were no other statistically significant demographic differences. Seven study patients, and 20 control subjects experienced a fall in leukocyte count greater than 10% (88% versus 36%, p = 0.01). Within each group, patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were more likely to experience this degree of hematologic toxicity than were patients with AIDS-related complex (p = 0.03). However, analysis of covariance showed no significant differences between the groups after 12 wk of azidothymidine with regard to mean leukocyte or platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, or values for tests of liver function. The groups were similar in transfusion requirements and frequency of changes in azidothymidine dosage. Although this study was limited in power by the number of patients and the nonrandomized, retrospective design, the data suggest that patients can tolerate concurrent therapy with azidothymidine and antimycobacterial agents without unacceptable toxicity.\r"

Intraperitoneal challenge resulted in high organ CFU counts but no mortality. Of relevance to the sexual practice of certain homosexual patients with AIDS is the intrarectal route of inoculation, which resulted in extensive involvement of the visceral organs with MAC disease. Multiple challenges by intravenous, oral, or rectal routes resulted in higher CFU counts than did single exposures.\r"

Specific antibodies raised in rabbits against the aminoterminal propeptide of human type III procollagen and against two basement membrane proteins, the 7S domain of human type IV collagen and the P1 fragment of human laminin, were used for the immunohistochemical analysis, and the result was confirmed by morphometry. Intraperitoneally injected carbon tetrachloride significantly increased the volume densities of reticulin fibers, type III pN-collagen, type IV collagen, and laminin, whereas treatment with malotilate completely normalized these. Binding of the antibodies to rat antigens was also demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy in which the collagen fibers with a typical periodic pattern were labeled positively with rabbit antitype III procollagen, whereas the amorphous basement membrane material reacted positively with rabbit antitype IV collagen and antilaminin, indicating good, specific cross-reactivity between these antibodies and the rat antigens. It is concluded that malotilate prevents the accumulation of type III pN-collagen and two basement membrane proteins, type IV collagen and laminin, in experimental pulmonary fibrosis, and can potentially be developed to provide a useful drug for preventing pulmonary fibrosis in humans.\r"

M241+ DC were found in the bronchiolar submucosa and alveolar parenchyma of nonsmokers; T6+ LC were present within the bronchiolar epithelium. Cigarette smoking was associated with a twofold increase in the total number of cells of DC/LC lineage and a 30-fold increase in the number of T6+ cells, many of which contained Birbeck granules (LC), present in the alveolar parenchyma. Most LC found in the parenchyma of smokers were observed in close association with areas of alveolar type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. Cigarette smoking did not change the number of differentiated state of cells of DC/LC lineage within the bronchioles. Both DC and LC are present in the human lung. Cigarette smoking has an important effect on the number, distribution, and differentiated state of these cells, which may explain why most adult patients who develop Langerhans cell granulomatosis are smokers.\r"

The stimulation of 5-HT uptake by exposure to anoxia was eliminated when bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (EC) were cocultured with SMC. Incubation with EC-conditioned medium produced similar inhibitory effects on 5-HT uptake of SMC exposed to anoxia, a result not seen with SMC-conditioned medium. The inhibitory effect of EC-conditioned medium on the anoxia-stimulated 5-HT uptake was concentration dependent and absent at a dilution of 1:16. The production of the inhibitor was time-dependent. The EC-derived inhibitory factor was heat-stable at 100 degrees C for as long as 10 min and was stable in a pH range from 5.0 to 10.0. Significant losses of inhibitory activity of EC-conditioned medium were observed after treatment with trypsin, pronase E, and proteinase K. The molecular weight on the inhibitory factor from EC-conditioned medium was estimated to be approximately 66,000 by size-exclusion chromatography. The data show that stimulated uptake of 5-HT by SMC under anoxic conditions is under regulation by a protein (or polypeptide) produced by EC.\r"

All patients but one were hypoxemic (PaO2 = 65 +/- 11 mm Hg, PaCO2 = 32 +/- 4 mm Hg, AaPO2 = 45 +/- 14 mm Hg), and all patients had pulmonary hypertension (mean Ppa = 45 +/- 11 mm Hg) with an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (mean PVR = 1,000 +/- 791 dyne/s/cm5, normal less than 300). The cardiac index was reduced (1.7 +/- 0.6 L/min/m2), as was the P-vO2 (31 +/- 5 mm Hg). Inert gas studies revealed widened unimodal Va/Q distributions in 20 of 25 subjects, with a log standard deviation of 1.01 +/- 0.32 (upper limit of normal, 0.6; ages 20 to 40), shunt = 0.03 +/- 0.05 of cardiac output, and dead space of 3.4 +/- 1.1 ml/kg (upper limit of normal, 2.9). The VD/VT ratio was 0.51 +/- 0.10. No low (VA/Q less than 0.1) or high (VA/Q greater than 10.0) regions were present, and no evidence for diffusion limitation of O2 transfer at rest was found. The low cardiac output and resulting low P-VO2 were responsible for approximately 33% of the increased AaPO2. The magnitude of the VA/Q abnormality correlated poorly with the PVR, the mean Ppa, or the magnitude of vascular obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of ventilation-perfusion scans in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is limited by the wide range of pulmonary diseases that are associated with abnormal scans, and by the largely undetermined prevalence of abnormal scans in persons without cardiopulmonary disease. In prior studies, we found perfusion defects to be rarely present in young persons and in older nonsmokers. To determine if normal older smokers have a higher prevalence of abnormal ventilation and perfusion scans, we performed six-view 99mTc perfusion (Q) scans and 133Xe ventilation (V) scans in 40 subjects 30 to 49 yr of age who had no known cardiopulmonary disease. Each subject had undergone a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, spirometry, and posteroanterior chest roentgenogram prior to scanning. All V and Q scans were interpreted blindly and independently by two experienced readers. No subject demonstrated a lobar or segmental defect on two views. One subject had a matched subsegmental defect, and one subject had delayed washout from a subsegmental area of the right upper lobe during V scanning, with a normal Q scan. We conclude that abnormal V and Q scans are uncommon among normal smokers 30 to 49 yr of age.\r"

A total of 101 trials of pulmonary function tests were obtained between 1 and 388 wk after the onset of ARDS. It was possible to evaluate impairment at 1 yr or more after ARDS in 27 subjects. Eighteen of the 27 were impaired. The percentage of ARDS survivors who were impaired on the basis of FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and DLCOsb was 50.0, 61.1, 33.3, and 82.4%, respectively. Impairment was mild in 13 (72.2%), moderate in four (22.2%), and severe in one (5.6%). Smoking status had no predictive value in determining impairment. Physiologic indices of ARDS severity (maximal pulmonary artery pressure, lowest static thoracic compliance, and maximal level of PEEP) were found to be significantly different when those impaired 1 yr or more after ARDS were compared with those not impaired. Symptoms were found to have no association with impairment. We conclude that, using ATS criteria, impairment 1 yr or more after ARDS onset is common. Patient characteristics and symptoms after ARDS have no association with impairment 1 yr or more after ARDS onset, whereas physiologic indices of severity during ARDS do.\r"

PFTs stabilized within 6 months of the episode and had returned to normal in most survivors. Persistent abnormalities were found after 6 months in diffusing capacity (14 of 23 patients, 61%), vital capacity (10 of 23 patients, 43%), and total lung capacity (five of 24 patients, 21%). To clarify the mechanisms underlying these persistent abnormalities, we attempted to correlate long-term PFT outcomes with estimates of the severity of initial lung injury as assessed from clinical data and with other features of the patient's course. The severity of lung function impairment during the first 3 days of ARDS was not related to long-term PFT values. However, a lower DLCO was related to a higher AaDO2, higher pulmonary artery pressure, and worse radiographic appearance on Days 4 through 7 and to the occurrence of sepsis. A lower FVC was related to higher pulmonary vascular resistance in Days 4 through 7 of ARDS. Long-term values for FVC and TLC were directly related to increasing levels of PEEP applied from Days 4 through 7 of ARDS in patients with peak airway pressures less than 50 cm H2O. Long-term abnormalities of pulmonary function of survivors of ARDS were not related to initial lung impairment but were directly related to persistence of impaired lung function during the acute episode. Recovery of lung function may also have been directly related to therapeutic modalities such as PEEP and impaired by the occurrence of sepsis.\r"

During bronchoconstriction induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (50 to 250 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) infusion after atropine (3 mg/kg, i.v.) and propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.v.), one lung was challenged with (1) citric acid aerosol or (2) capsaicin aerosol or (3) lung volume change (lung inflation). Citric acid or capsaicin inhalation to one lung produced significant bronchodilatation in not only the stimulated lung (SL) but also in the opposite lung (OL). The 5-HT-induced change in pulmonary resistance (RL) was reduced 66.5 +/- 3.3% (mean +/- 1 SE) (SL) and 53.0 +/- 8.1% (OL) by citric acid (20%) and 40.5 +/- 8.9% (SL) and 44.0 +/- 9.9% (OL) by capsaicin (0.1%) inhalation, respectively. These bronchodilatations were abolished by bilateral vagotomy. Inflation of one side of the lung did not reduce the 5-HT-induced change in RL in the OL. These findings indicate that (1) C-fiber and irritant receptors are the possible sensory receptors of the NAINS reflex pathway, and (2) afferent nerve stimulation of NAINS in one lung can produce reflex bronchodilatation in both lungs.\r"

The resected lung specimens were fixed in the inflated state and cut at 1-cm intervals in the horizontal plane. The pathologic extent of emphysema was quantitated by comparison with a standard reference panel of emphysema grading. The overall extent of emphysema on CT was assessed by a visual scoring system in a total of 55 patients, 19 undergoing lung resection and 36 not undergoing lung resection. Analysis of 37 patients by pathology scores revealed 18 with no or trivial emphysema (emphysema grades less than or equal to 5; mean grade, 2.2 +/- SD 2.6) and 19 with emphysema (grades greater than or equal to 10; mean grade, 33.2 +/- SD 24.2).

The pathology grade of emphysema showed a significant correlation with (DLCO) (r = -0.53) and DLCO/VA (r = -0.55), which was greater than the correlation with PLmax (r = -0.42) and PL90 (r = -0.43).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nine patients with SAS were treated for 7 days with chlormadinone acetate (CMA), a respiratory stimulant known to increase not only CO2 and hypoxic chemosensitivity but also respiratory drive response for ventilatory loading. They were examined as to sleep events and ventilatory control during wakefulness before and during CMA treatment. Apnea-hypopnea index was significantly reduced from 51.1 +/- 5.7 to 43.6 +/- 8.1 episodes/h (p less than 0.05). The ratio of desaturation time with more than 4% SaO2 fall to total sleep time was diminished in seven of nine patients, and its mean value decreased from 44.9 +/- 8.6 to 28.7 +/- 8.1% (p less than 0.05). Both hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) and load response during wakefulness were significantly increased, although isocapnic hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) was not significantly enhanced by CMA. The degree of augmentation in awake load response as well as in HCVR was positively correlated with that of improvement in sleep-disordered breathing. Moreover, patients who did not show amelioration in oxygen desaturation were found to be incapable of increasing load response despite increased HCVR. We conclude that CMA therapy for sleep apnea syndrome is effective in the patients whose load response as well as respiratory control activity are augmented during wakefulness.\r"

Active rib cage expansion produced by phasic contraction of the inspiratory muscles of the rib cage should reduce respiratory abdominal pressure fluctuations by moving the anterior abdominal wall outward and cephalad, thereby having an expanding influence on the abdominal cavity. During quiet sleep (n = 13), CO2-induced hyperventilation was associated with significant increases in VT, Pga, rib cage volume (Vrc), and abdominal volume (Vab). Increments in Pga were small relative to VT, as shown by an increase in the slope of the VT versus Pga respiratory loop (VT/Pga) in all subjects (p less than 0.001, paired t test). CO2 breathing was associated with an increase in the contribution of the rib cage compartment to total volume change (Vrc/Vrc + Vab) in all infants studied (p less than 0.001, paired t test), and the total volume response to hyperventilation was more strongly related to changes in rib cage volume (slope = 0.62, r = 0.90) than to abdominal volume (slope = 0.31, r = 0.60). During REM sleep (n = 6), mean VT/Pga did not change significantly, and the rib cage contribution to tidal breathing decreased in three of six infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have investigated whether MRR of esophageal pressure (Pes) generated by voluntary sniffs is decreased by fatigue, and whether sniff nasopharyngeal (Pnp) and mouth (Pmo) MRR reflect these changes. In 10 normal subjects, control MRR of sniff Pes correlated closely to Pnp MRR (r = 0.977, p less than 0.001) and Pmo MRR (r = 0.947, p less than 0.001). To produce inspiratory muscle fatigue, four highly motivated subjects breathed to exhaustion (3 to 6 min) through a high inspiratory resistance. MRR was determined from 10 sniffs for Pes, Pnp, and Pmo before fatigue, and at intervals up to 10 min after fatigue. The subjects showed a mean decrease in sniff Pes MRR of 33% (range, 20 to 42) immediately after fatigue, which returned exponentially to control values within 3 to 4 min. The mean changes in Pes MRR were reflected by similar changes in Pnp MRR, 32% (range, 18 to 43) and Pmo MRR, 33% (range, 21 to 42). Studies were repeated in the four subjects with closely similar results. We conclude that fatigue of the inspiratory muscles reduces MRR of sniff Pes, and that this is reflected in Pnp and Pmo. Sniff Pes, Pnp, and Pmo MRR measurements may provide a useful method for detecting and monitoring fatigue; Pnp and Pmo have the advantage of being less invasive.\r"

To determine if we could improve the expiratory function of these subjects, we studied six patients in whom the pectoralis major was trained by repetitive, strenuous, isometric contractions for 6 wk. Six patients receiving conventional respiratory rehabilitation served as control subjects. Training of the pectoralis major produced marked increases in the maximal isometric muscle strength (mean +/- SE: 54.6 +/- 5.8%; p less than 0.005) and in expiratory reserve volume (46.6 +/- 9.9%; p less than 0.005). Functional residual capacity did not change, such that residual volume decreased by 14.1 +/- 2.9% (p less than 0.005). In contrast, the control patients did not develop any significant alterations. We conclude that unlike conventional rehabilitation, training the pectoralis major for strength improves expiratory function in tetraplegic subjects. Therefore, training of this muscle should increase the effectiveness of coughing and might reduce the prevalence of bronchopulmonary infections in such subjects.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the spontaneous breathing patterns of 10 normal adult volunteers during high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), accomplished by inflating and deflating a vest worn around each subject's thorax at 2.5 Hz. Tidal volumes generated by HFCWO averaged 100 ml. Mean vest pressure was maintained at approximately 35 cm H2O throughout each experiment, even when HFCWO was not applied. During HFCWO, subjects were instructed occasionally to exhale deeply to obtain end-tidal samples representative of PACO2. HFCWO increased the breath-to-breath variability of spontaneous respiration in all subjects, prolonging expiratory pauses and producing short apneas in some cases. PACO2 decreased significantly (p less than 0.05). The effects on minute ventilation, tidal volume, and inspiratory and expiratory durations remained variable across subjects, even when differences in PACO2 between control and HFCWO states were reduced through inhalation of a low CO2 mixture. None of the changes were statistically significant, although average expiratory duration increased by 29%. Ventilatory responses to CO2 with and without HFCWO were also measured. Normocapnic (PACO2 = 40 mm Hg) ventilatory drive increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in six subjects (Type 1 response) and decreased substantially in the others (Type 2 response); with hypercapnia, the changes in drive were attenuated in both groups. Consequently, CO2 sensitivity decreased in Type 1 subjects and increased in Type 2 subjects. A simple analysis based on this result shows that with HFCWO, Type 2 subjects breathing air will tend to have a lower spontaneous minute ventilation and become hypercapnic. Type 1 subjects will become hypocapnic, but minute ventilation may be higher or lower than control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate the nature of breathlessness produced by a dissociation between ventilation and chemical drive, we studied ten naive normal subjects who breathed at various levels of ventilation while end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) was held at 55 mm Hg. After a 10-min equilibration period of free breathing at PETCO2 = 55 mm Hg, subjects used a visual target to adjust ventilation to five different levels ranging from 50% below to 50% above the chemically driven ventilation (CDV). Ratings of breathlessness were made on a visual analogue scale relative to the intensity of breathlessness experience at CDV. As ventilation was targeted to levels below CDV, all subjects became increasingly breathless; the response was more variable when ventilation was targeted to levels above CDV. Overall, the relationship between ventilation and breathlessness was described by a hyperbolic function, for which the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.92. Ventilation was suppressed below CDV without recruitment of antagonistic muscles during inspiration. The intensity of breathlessness was not correlated with measures of respiratory effort. We conclude that suppressed ventilation is a useful model for the study of breathlessness not fully explained by measures of respiratory effort and we speculate that the dissociation between chemical drive and afferent signals produced by motion of the lung and chest wall is important in modulating the sensation of breathlessness.\r"

The two inbred lines differed in lung and body size as well as in morphometric parameters. These parameters were found to be under genetic control by sire, dam, both, or none. From the data of reciprocal crossing, it appears that there is a maternal effect on the following parameters: body weight, fresh lung weight, fixed lung volume/fresh lung weight, specific lung volume, alveolar wall proportion, mean alveolar wall thickness, and mean linear intercept. Through a more detailed genetic analysis, it was found that specific lung volume in one F1 offspring showed an additive effect. On the other hand, the following parameters indicated heterotic effects (an increase or decrease in dimension compared to the parents with many possibly favorable) in one or both F1 offspring: body weight, fresh lung weight, fixed lung volume/fresh lung weight, specific lung volume, alveolar wall proportion, mean alveolar wall thickness, mean linear intercept, mean chord length of alveoli, mean chord length of alveolar ducts, alveolar surface area, and alveolar surface area to lung volume ratio. These findings indicate that genetic effects are important factors in normal lung development.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-seven surgically removed lungs and lobes were studied to assess the relation between the abundance of bronchiolar epithelial cells containing antileukoprotease (ALP) (ALP-pos/mm) and the degree of small airways disease (SADscore) and emphysema (destructive index = DI, and number of normal alveolar attachments on membranous bronchioles = normal AA/min). Between subjects, ALPpos/mm correlated with SADscore in membranous bronchioles (rs = 0.75; p less than 0.001) and with normal AA/mm (rs = -0.38; p = 0.05). Evaluation within each subject revealed significant correlations of ALPpos/mm with SADscore in membranous as well as in respiratory bronchioles (p less than 0.001), and also with normal AA/mm (p = 0.005). In membranous and in respiratory bronchioles, ALPpos/mm correlated significantly with the ALP concentration in homogenized tissue, as measured by ELISA (rs = 0.55 and 0.57, respectively; p less than 0.01). It is concluded that disease in small airways and destruction of their alveolar attachments are associated with a rise of the number of ALP-containing epithelial cells. We hypothesize that this cellular increase is part of the general defense against inflammatory and destructive processes in distal human airways, leading to higher levels of proteinase inhibitor in order to minimize tissue damage.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages are thought to play an important role in the turnover of extracellular matrix, but the capacity of human macrophages to degrade elastin, and the elastolytic mechanisms of these cells, have been controversial. Particular difficulty has been encountered in efforts to establish whether human macrophages secrete a metalloelastase that is analogous to the enzyme secreted by rodent macrophages. We studied elastin degradation by human alveolar macrophages cultured directly in contact with radiolabeled elastin using media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and for comparison performed parallel studies of P388D1 murine macrophagelike cells that are known to secrete metalloelastase. With both cell types, we observed elastin degradation and the following: (1) direct contact between the cells and elastin substrate was required for elastin degradation; (2) elastin degradation was inhibited by the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, but minimally or not at all by inhibitors of cysteine proteinases (E-64, CBZ-phe-phe-CHN2, CBZ-phe-ala-CHN2, and cystatin C), or by the serine proteinase inhibitor eglin-c; (3) elastin degradation increased sharply after the cells were in contact with elastin for 24 h, and required new protein synthesis as indicated by sensitivity to cycloheximide; (4) inclusion of dexamethasone (10(-6) to 10(-8) M) in the cultures led to decreased elastin degradation. Also, with both cell types, elastin degradation occurred despite the finding that cell-conditioned media did not contain elastase activity and could inhibit P388D1-derived metalloproteinase elastase. These results indicate a prominent role for metalloproteinase activity in elastin degradation by both human and murine macrophages and support the concept that events at the cell-substrate interface are critically important to macrophage-mediated elastin degradation.\r"

  ".U": "89226690\r", 
  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages (AM) can play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease via their ability to produce potent inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators. We found that rat AM cultured with 1 to 100 micrograms/ml of silica particles or asbestos fibers produced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in a concentration-dependent fashion, whereas latex beads, an inert phagocytic stimulus, failed to induce significant augmentation of either TNF or LTB4. In a time course study, AM stimulated for 2 h with silica or asbestos produced an increased amount of LTB4, which preceded the rise in TNF activity detected 7 and 24 h after culture initiation. The induction appears to involve the synthesis of new protein since actinomycin D and cycloheximide abrogate the majority of the stimulatory effect. We next examined the role of LTB4 in mineral-dust-induced TNF production. The lipoxygenase inhibitors nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and AA861 used at 1 to 50 micrograms/ml reduced in a concentration-dependent fashion asbestos- or silica-stimulated TNF release. On the other hand, \"reconstitutive\" experiments in which we added exogenous LTB4 (10(-14) to 10(-8) M) to AM treated with lipoxygenase inhibitors showed partial restoration of TNF production induced by chrysotile or silica, with peak effect at 10(-10)M LTB4. The present study demonstrated that AM incubated in the presence of chrysotile A or silica can produce both LTB4 and TNF and that endogenous lipoxygenase metabolites as well as exogenous LTB4 can act to amplify TNF production. These observations suggest a common mechanism by which asbestos and silica may modulate the production of inflammatory and fibrogenic cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro, crocidolite asbestos toxicity to macrophages is mediated by the production of reactive oxygen metabolites. We examined whether exposure of macrophages to crocidolite asbestos induced lipid peroxidation as measured by the thiobarbituric acid assay. When elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages were exposed to crocidolite, a dose- and time-dependent increase in lipid peroxidation breakdown products accompanied cell death. Superoxide dismutase plus catalase or deferoxamine prevented both lipid peroxidation and loss of viability caused by crocidolite. We tested whether crocidolite-induced lipid peroxidation was causally responsible for cell death. Macrophages were not killed by crocidolite when incubated with 10 mM 3-aminobenzamide. The level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive material was the same, however, for cells incubated with crocidolite in the presence or absence of 3-aminobenzamide. When macrophagaes were pretreated for 24 h with 25 microM vitamin E and then incubated with crocidolite, no thiobarbituric acid-reactive products were detected. Vitamin E, however, did not prevent crocidolite cytotoxicity. These results suggest that exposure of macrophages to crocidolite asbestos produces lipid peroxidation as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive products. This reaction, however, is not directly responsible for irreversible injury in this model system.\r"

  ".W": "Although open lung biopsy (OLB) is frequently employed for diagnosis of pulmonary lesions in patients with Hodgkin's disease, the actual efficacy of the procedure in establishing a diagnosis in these patients, and its effect on their treatment and clinical outcome, have not been evaluated. We reviewed the results of OLB in 41 patients with previously diagnosed Hodgkin's disease (17 with stage II disease, 10 with stage III, and 14 with stage IV) who had pulmonary opacification on chest roentgenogram. Nineteen (46%) diagnoses were specific and 22 nonspecific. The most common specific diagnosis was Hodgkin's disease (12 patients); the others were Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), solitary fungal granuloma (2), cytomegalovirus pneumonia (1), and primary lung adenocarcinoma (1). Specific diagnoses were made in 11 (69%) of 16 patients with discrete nodules or masses but in only eight (32%) of the 25 patients with non-nodular radiographic opacification. Eleven (58%) of 19 patients who were asymptomatic or had had symptoms for longer than 4 wk had specific diagnoses, compared to one of six patients (17%) symptomatic for 1 wk or less. Survival of hospitalization correlated more with stage of Hodgkin's disease than with specific diagnosis. However, treatment was changed after biopsy in 22 (54%) of the patients. The results suggest that OLB can be helpful in the management of patients with Hodgkin's disease and pulmonary infiltrates, both in establishing a diagnosis and in assisting the patients' management. OLB appears to be more helpful in patients with Hodgkin's disease than in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and pulmonary infiltrates.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive case series before and after balloon valvuloplasty. SETTING: Tertiary care referral hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 26 patients aged 80 years or older with symptomatic aortic stenosis referred for balloon valvuloplasty from July 1987 to July 1988. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty reduced the transvalvular gradient from 59 (95% CI, 51 to 67) to 31 mm Hg (95% CI, 26 to 35; P less than 0.0001) and increased aortic valve area from 0.45 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.51) to 0.67 cm2 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.76; P less than 0.0001). The mean length of hospital stay for the entire study population was 11.2 days (95% CI, 7.3 to 15.2) at a total hospital charge per patient of $29,600 (95% CI, 21,050 to 38,150). For patients having procedural complications (11 complications in 8 patients), surgical procedures, or cardiogenic shock, the mean hospital stay increased to 16.2 days (95% CI, 6.2 to 26.2; P less than 0.05) and the hospital charge increased to $44,400 (95% CI, 24,280 to 64,520; P less than 0.01). Two patients who presented with cardiogenic shock died, and 1 patient had an aortic valve replacement before discharge. Four patients were recently discharged (less than 1 month) and follow-up was obtained in the remaining 19 patients at 6.1 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 8.1). Five more patients, including the remaining patient who presented with cardiogenic shock, died after discharge for an overall mortality of 32%. Twelve of the remaining fourteen patients had fewer symptoms and improved an average of 1.1 New York Heart Association classes (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.4; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty in patients 80 years and older improves hemodynamics and symptoms of heart failure during short-term follow-up in most patients, but overall mortality is high in this elderly patient population. Hospital charges and length of stay were much higher in patients with complications or coexisting medical illnesses. Valvuloplasty is a reasonable alternative treatment for patients with aortic stenosis who require palliative treatment of symptoms and have high surgical risk.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional questionnaire study comparing respiratory therapists with controls (physical therapists and radiologic technologists). Subsequent validation of reported asthma with methacholine challenge studies. SUBJECTS: All respiratory therapists and physical therapists and a random 50% sample of radiologic technologists working in the state of Rhode Island as of June 1986. METHODS: All subjects received a mail questionnaire with questions about the presence or absence of asthma, time of onset, and important covariates. Responses were analyzed for all subjects, and again after excluding those subjects with pre-existing asthma. Subjects who reported physician-diagnosed asthma were asked to have methacholine challenge testing. RESULTS: Respondents included 194 respiratory therapists (response rate, 69.5%) and 517 controls (response rate, 75.3%). After excluding respiratory therapists from the hospital at which the hypothesis was generated, there were 34 respiratory therapists (18.7%) and 30 controls (5.8%) reporting physician-diagnosed asthma. After controlling for age, smoking status, family history, atopic history, and other covariates using logistic regression, respiratory therapy carried an odds ratio of 3.2 (95% CI, 1.9 to 5.5). With analysis restricted to those who developed asthma after entering their profession, the odds ratio for respiratory therapy was 4.6 (95% CI, 2.0 to 10.4). In the validation study, 10 of 14 respiratory therapists (71%) and 6 of 10 controls (60%) had evidence of bronchial hyperreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a previously unrecognized excess of asthma in respiratory therapists. The excess develops after entry into the profession, and does not appear to be explained by confounding, information bias, or selection bias.\r"

DESIGN: A case-control study of hepatitis B carriers with and without serologic evidence of hepatitis D virus infection. Demographic, institutional, and medical data were obtained through questionnaires and chart review. Clinical status was assessed by liver function assays. SETTING: Thirteen Illinois state facilities for the developmentally disabled. PARTICIPANTS: Clients (238) who were hepatitis B carriers. RESULTS: Antibody to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV) was detected in 71 of 238 (30%) hepatitis B carriers. Nine of thirteen facilities housed positive clients. Previous residence at one facility, designated B, was the strongest correlate of anti-HDV positivity; 85% of positive persons had lived there compared with 16% of negative controls (odds ratio 28.3 [95% CI, 13.2 to 60.7], P less than 0.001). Past hepatitis episodes were more common among anti-HDV-positive clients (37% compared with 7%) (odds ratio, 7.5 [95% CI, 3.0 to 19.1], P less than 0.001) and occurred mainly at facility B from 1950 to 1975. Liver function tests were infrequently abnormal among anti-HDV-positive clients. CONCLUSIONS: Results show widespread hepatitis D virus infection in our institutionalized population and suggest that transmission occurred mainly in the past at the overcrowded facility B. The low prevalence of laboratory evidence of chronic liver disease in the anti-HDV-positive clients may be explained by increased mortality among those originally infected from 1950 to 1975.\r"

DESIGN: Assessment of immune reactivity against epithelial-cell-associated components (ECAC). METHODS: Detection of specific anti-ECAC serum antibodies by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (percent specific lysis) and by immunoblotting (Western blots). PATIENTS: Index cases (131) and first-degree relatives in 17 families with 2 or more affected members, and 13 with only 1 member affected. MAIN RESULTS: Compared with a gastrointestinal disease control group (0.5% +/- 0.8%), specific lysis against ECAC-C (colon-derived) among patients with inflammatory bowel disease was significantly greater in both multiply affected (8.4% +/- 8.2%; P less than 0.01) and singly affected (5.2% +/- 5.4%; P less than 0.05) families. In contrast, specific lysis by patients with other inflammatory processes of the small and large bowel (1.1% +/- 1.4%) or autoimmune disease (0.7% +/- 1.0%) did not differ from that of the gastrointestinal disease control group. Among relatives of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (index cases), specific lysis was also significantly higher than in the control group (4.8% +/- 5.5% for multiply affected, P less than 0.01, and 4.3% +/- 5.5% for singly affected, P less than 0.05). Relatives of patients with chronic inflammatory liver disease had a level of lysis (0.6% +/- 0.9%) similar to that of controls. The prevalence of antibodies to ECAC-C was 69.7% among patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and 55.7% among relatives; both prevalences were significantly higher than that of the control group (8.0%, P less than 0.001). Using small-bowel-derived ECAC, the prevalence of antibodies among patients with inflammatory bowel disease and relatives was also significantly higher than that of controls. Reactivity of sera was directed to a 160- and a 137-kilodalton macromolecule. CONCLUSIONS: Immune sensitization to intestinal epithelial antigens is common in families with chronic inflammatory bowel disease; its high frequency among asymptomatic relatives suggests it may represent a primary phenomenon, perhaps predisposing individuals to gut tissue injury.\r"

Fluorescein angiography showed a delayed filling of the veins in the affected retina and late staining of these veins. Since there was severe visual impairment in each case, systemic adrenocorticosteroids were administered, and a rapid improvement in visual acuity occurred.

Fifty-six (an incidence of 3.53 per 100 person-years at risk) developed a progressive dementia: 32 met diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (an incidence of 2.0 per 100 person-years at risk), 15 had vascular or mixed dementia, and 9 had other disorders or remain undiagnosed. New cases of dementia were as common as myocardial infarction and twice as common as stroke. Risk factors for both dementia and AD were age (over 80) and gender (female); other reported risk factors such as family history, prior head injury, thyroid disease, maternal age, and smoking were not risk factors for AD in this elderly cohort. Prior stroke was the major risk factor for vascular or mixed dementia; diabetes and left ventricular hypertrophy but not a history of hypertension per se were also risk factors for vascular dementia. The major predictor of the development of AD was the mental status score on entry. The 58.5% of the cohort who made zero to two errors on a 33-item mental status test had a less than 0.6% per year chance of developing AD, whereas the 16% of the cohort with five to eight errors on this test developed AD at a rate of over 12% per year. Thus, it is possible to identify a large cohort of 80-year-olds who are at low risk for AD and a smaller cohort at very high risk.\r"

These findings leave open the possibility that elevated levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) for this protein may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Using Northern analysis, we compared the levels of mRNA for the APP and 3 cytoskeletal proteins in parietal cortex of 6 brains having marked AD-type degeneration with the levels of these mRNAs in 6 control samples. The cytoskeletal mRNAs studied were those for the human neurofilament 68-kDa subunit (HNFL), for alpha-tubulin, and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). A ribonuclease (RNase) protection assay was also used to compare AD and control HNFL mRNA levels. The mRNAs for APP, HNFL, and alpha-tubulin were diminished in AD cortex. The decrement for APP mRNA was less than that for HNFL or alpha-tubulin. The message for GFAP in AD cortex showed no loss. The findings support a general deficit in neuronal mRNAs, including that for APP. They do not exclude the possibility of elevated levels of the message for the APP in small neuronal subsets, in subcortical neurons projecting to cortex, or as a generalized phenomenon in earlier stages of the disease.\r"

During the spike complex in each patient there was a spike at the deep sphenoidal electrode and a spike at the superficial scalp electrode on spontaneous electroencephalography. In each patient the sphenoidal spike had a different peak latency than the scalp spike, consistent with spike propagation. Electroencephalography was used to trigger two magnetoencephalographic averages of stereotyped spikes during the sphenoidal peak and the scalp peak. Magnetoencephalography discriminated the centers of two cortical spike populations at different latencies, showing deeper localization with sphenoidal trigger and more superficial localization with scalp trigger in each patient (p less than 0.05). Latency differences and propagation distances of spikes were consistent with the conduction velocity of corticocortical fibers. Noninvasive estimates of the cortical surface area of the spikes agreed with estimates obtained by electrocorticography over temporal neocortex. These findings indicate propagation of neuronal populations active during human interictal spikes between deep and superficial cortex of temporal lobe, likely by monosynaptic or oligosynaptic pathways. This interictal system appears to be partly independent of the hippocampal interictal system in complex partial epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of 1,805 hospitalized patients in the Stroke Data Bank of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, the 1,273 with infarction were classified into diagnostic subtypes. Diagnosis was based on the clinical history, examination, and laboratory tests including computed tomography, noninvasive vascular imaging, and where safe and relevant, angiography. Five hundred and eight cases (fully 40%) were labeled as infarcts of undetermined cause (IUC), of which 138 (27%) were evaluated with both computed tomography and angiography. The clinical syndrome and computed tomographic and angiographic findings in 91 (65.9%) of these 138 IUC cases were clearly not attributable to large-artery thrombosis and could permit reclassification of the infarct as due to some form of embolism. Failure to define a source of embolus kept them in the category of IUC. Thirty-one cases (22.5%) could be reclassified as due to stenosis or thrombosis of a large artery, and 16 (11.6%) as lacunar infarction. To determine if those selected for angiography among the IUC patients differed from those with other final diagnoses, a stepwise multiple logistic model was used. The most important characteristics were young age, presence of a superficial infarct, prior transient ischemic attack, low weakness score, and presentation with a nonlacunar syndrome. The results of the model suggest that angiography use was determined by clinical characteristics uniformly across centers and not by final diagnosis. Continued use of the category IUC may help clarify risk factors and stroke subtypes, allow new mechanisms of ischemic stroke to be uncovered, and prevent classification categories of stroke used in clinical trials from becoming too broad.\r"

Since the quinolones are a promising group of antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of M. hominis and U. urealyticum to the newer 6-fluoroquinolones were determined by the agar dilution method. Ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, and ofloxacin had good activity against M. hominis, with the MIC for 50% of isolates tested (MIC50) being 1 microgram/ml. Fleroxacin, lomefloxacin, pefloxacin, and rosoxacin had MIC50s of 2 micrograms/ml. Enoxacin, norfloxacin, and amifloxacin had MIC50s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml, and cinoxacin and nalidixic acid were inactive (MIC50, greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml). Overall, the activities of 6-fluoroquinolones for ureaplasmas were similar to those for M. hominis, with MICs being the same or twofold greater. The most active 6-fluoroquinolones against ureaplasmas were difloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin, with MIC50s of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin was unusual in that the MIC50 for M. hominis was 1 microgram/ml, whereas the MIC50 for ureaplasmas was 8 micrograms/ml. Since the MIC50s for the most active quinolones approximate achievable concentrations in blood and urine, quinolones have promise in treating mycoplasmal infections.\r"

In competition experiments, the penem showed a very low affinity for this protein, and a concentration more than 4 times the MIC was required for penicillin-binding protein 2a saturation. When the classical competitive procedure was modified by increasing the time of incubation of either membranes or growing cells with FCE 22101, the antibiotic showed a much higher affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a and saturated the protein at a concentration close to the MIC, with slow kinetics.\r"

One day before administration of treatments 2 and 3, 1 g of sucralfate was given at 7 a.m., 11 a.m., 5 p.m., and 10 p.m. Blood samples were collected immediately before the norfloxacin dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postdose. Urine was collected in divided intervals: from 0 to 12, from 12 to 24, and from 24 to 48 h. Norfloxacin concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Mean area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve extrapolated to infinity decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) after norfloxacin was given with and 2 h after sucralfate. The relative bioavailabilities were 1.8% when norfloxacin was taken with sucralfate and 56.6% when it was taken 2 h after sucralfate. After norfloxacin was given alone, the mean norfloxacin concentrations in urine collected during intervals of 0 to 12, 12 to 24, and 24 to 28 h were 118.9 +/- 72.3, 18.8 +/- 12.5, and 2.4 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml, respectively.

Lesions included erythematous round macules, papules, or nodules that first appeared on the extensor surface of the arms, but subsequently involved the legs, trunk, and face. Histologically, the lesions were characterized by varying degrees of mixed (predominantly eosinophilic) perivascular and perifollicular inflammatory cell infiltrates of the dermis. The lesions did not respond to any therapeutic regimens used and usually persisted throughout the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome illness. Demographic and laboratory data did not distinguish these patients from those without pruritic skin lesions.\r"

High electrical impedance can result in inaccurate interpretation of evoked potentials due to excessive artifacts. This study investigated the electrical skin impedance in 36 full-term infants who ranged from 0 to 1 year of age to delineate the temporal relationship between skin maturation and skin impedance. Correlation and regression analyses demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship between electrical skin impedance and age during the first year of life. This drop in skin impedance during the first few postnatal months was attributed to an increase in skin hydration as a result of the greater functional maturity of eccrine sweat glands.\r"

The fourth patient, who had no evidence of additional infections, had a normal T4 value and T4/T8 ratio, but was anergic on skin testing. All the men were serologically negative for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. One of the immunosuppressed patients developed squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, which, along with his bowenoid papulosis, contained human papillomavirus 16 DNA. We suggest that patients with persistent bowenoid papulosis be investigated for altered immune status and followed up as potential candidates for the development of epithelial malignant neoplasms.\r"

As pruritus of the anogenital area was always present, scratching may have resulted in autoinoculation. The fact that a \"mucosal-type\" HPV, which was cloned from a cancer of the uterine cervix, was detected in a dysplastic periungual lesion seems noteworthy. Viral copy numbers appeared to be much higher in the periungual lesion, indicating that in our patient HPV-35 was able to replicate well outside the anogenital area.

We reviewed our experience with 11 neonates and young infants with truncus arteriosus undergoing repair (median age, 21 days). Five patients also had major truncal valve insufficiency, and 2 required valve replacement. Right ventricle-pulmonary artery continuity was established with a porcine valved conduit in 3 patients and an aortic or pulmonary homograft in 8. There was 1 operative death (9%; 70% confidence limits, 3%-22%) and 1 late death over a mean follow-up of 21 months (range, 4 to 32 months). Eight of the 9 late survivors are growing normally. Echocardiographic examination revealed normal ventricular function in all patients (mean shortening fraction, 39%). Doppler assessment demonstrated trivial prosthetic or homograft valve regurgitation in 7 patients and mild to moderate obstruction in 5 patients. This recent experience with repair of truncus arteriosus indicates that the operative risk is low even in the neonate. Repair in the first month of life should be recommended before the development of critical congestive heart failure or irreversible pulmonary vascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1979, 17 infants and children have undergone reoperation for systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation 6 weeks to 7 years after repair of congenital heart defects. Prior operations were repair of incomplete or complete AV canal (14 patients), Mustard repair of complex transposition of the great arteries including ventricular septal defect closure (2 patients), or first-stage operation for hypoplastic left heart (1 patient). Age ranged from 6 months to 11 years. In 12 of the 17 patients (10, AV canal; 1, transposition; 1, hypoplastic left heart), valve reconstruction was possible. Operative techniques included a combination of septal cleft approximation, leaflet resection, commissural annuloplasty, or ring annuloplasty. There were no operative deaths, and there were no reoperations in the repair group. The condition of these patients has improved. Follow-up ranges from 1 month to 9 years (mean follow-up, 4.1 years). Five of the 17 patients (4, AV canal; 1, transposition) underwent valve replacement. There were no operative deaths. Follow-up ranges from 3 to 8 years. Three patients later underwent re-replacement of the prosthetic valve; there was 1 late death. The condition of all 4 survivors is improved. Substantial AV valve regurgitation can occur months or years after repair of congenital heart defects. A combination of reconstructive techniques may be useful in preserving native valve function and avoiding systemic AV valve replacement.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine whether rigid-ring annuloplasty and flexible-ring annuloplasty have the same effect on left ventricular function in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to degenerative disease of the mitral valve. Twenty-five patients who underwent isolated mitral valve repair and required annuloplasty were randomized into two groups: rigid-ring and flexible-ring annuloplasty. Left ventricular function was assessed by echocardiography and radionuclide angiography on the day before operation and 2 to 3 months later. Preoperative left ventricular function was similar in the two groups of patients. Postoperatively, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and volume decreased significantly in both groups. The left ventricular end-systolic diameter and volume decreased significantly only in patients with a flexible annuloplasty ring. Left ventricular systolic function as assessed by pressure-volume relationships was significantly better in patients with a flexible ring (p less than 0.02 by analysis of covariance), and left ventricular performance measured by stroke volume-end-diastolic volume relationships was also better in these patients (p less than 0.05 by analysis of covariance). These data indicate that patients with a flexible annuloplasty ring have better left ventricular systolic function than patients with a rigid annuloplasty ring 2 to 3 months after mitral valve reconstruction for chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to degenerative disease of the mitral valve.\r"

Preoperative autologous donation has been suggested to reduce these risks. This is a report concerning 104 consecutive adult autologous donors (group 1) who had an elective cardiac operation. A similar group of 111 patients operated on during the same period but without autologous blood donation was used for comparison (group 2). Both groups contained similar numbers of patients with coronary artery disease, valvular disease, and mixed lesions, and both had several patients with atrial septal defects. Group 2 patients (mean age, 67.8 years) were significantly older than group 1 patients (mean age, 58.9 years) (p less than 0.05). The mean donation in group 1 was 4.1 units, but 12 (11.5%) had to discontinue donations. Increasing angina in 10 (12.2%) of the 82 patients with coronary artery disease was the most common complication, and necessitated hospitalization in two instances. In 77 (75.5%) of the 102 group 1 patients who had operation and 23 (21%) of the 110 group 2 patients, no homologous blood products were required. Group 1 patients used significantly less homologous fresh frozen plasma (0.1 unit versus 0.97 unit; p less than 0.005) and packed red blood cells (0.6 unit versus 2.1 units; p less than 0.001) than group 2 patients. Group 1 patients received 3.3 and 3.1 units of autologous packed cells and plasma, respectively. No complications of autologous transfusion were seen. Predonation of autologous blood is an effective, safe method of reducing homologous blood requirements in elective cardiac operations, but it does carry some risk, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

The difference between mean pulmonary artery pressure and mean right atrial pressure, which reflects the positive stroke work index of the ventricle, disappeared once the right ventricular cavity was reduced to 25% of normal (15.0 +/- 6.1 versus 14.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg; p = not significant). Experimental results were correlated with postoperative catheterization data from 19 patients with tricuspid atresia who had the Fontan operation.

  ".W": "Total correction of tetralogy of Fallot was performed without a ventriculotomy in 39 patients aged 8 months to 39 years (mean age, 9.1 years) between May 1984 and July 1988. A transatrial approach was used to resect the obstructed infundibulum and to close the ventricular septal defect. In 14 patients, the pulmonary annulus was not enlarged (group 1). Twenty-five patients required a transannular patch (group 2), placed by extending the pulmonary artery incision 1 cm into the right ventricular infundibulum. Eleven patients had repair of pulmonary artery branch stenosis, and associated intracardiac anomalies were simultaneously corrected in 10 patients. After repair, the right ventricular to left ventricular systolic pressure ratios ranged from 0.36 to 0.59 (mean ratio, 0.45) in group 1 and 0.33 to 0.70 (mean ratio, 0.51) in group 2. There were no hospital or late deaths in group 1. Two patients in group 2 with a small left ventricle died shortly after operation. The 37 survivors were followed for 2 to 51 months. Postoperative catheterization in 7 patients detected no residual ventricular septal defects, mild pulmonary regurgitation in 2 patients (group 2), and right ventricular to left ventricular pressure ratios ranging from 0.25 to 0.42 (mean ratio, 0.34). Only 1 patient with a previous total repair by ventriculotomy is symptomatic and requires antiarrhythmic agents and diuretics. The other 36 patients are asymptomatic. In conclusion, tetralogy of Fallot can be safely repaired at any age without a ventriculotomy. The results indicate a minimal incidence of postoperative arrhythmias and pulmonary regurgitation, as well as improved right ventricular function.\r"

In a canine model of two hours of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by four hours of reperfusion, Trolox and ascorbic acid reduced the area of infarction within the area at risk. The Trolox group received 500 mL of deoxygenated saline solution containing 2.0 g of Trolox, 3.0 g of ascorbic acid, and 18 mg of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) infused into the ascending aorta 30 seconds before and four minutes after reperfusion. Saline controls received 500 mL of deoxygenated saline solution containing 18 mg of EDTA. The angioplasty group had unmodified reperfusion by simple release of the occlusion. The area at risk and the area infarcted were estimated with Evans blue and triphenyl tetrazolium hydrochloride stains, respectively. The ratio of the area infarcted to the area at risk was significantly lower with Trolox (angioplasty, 30.4% +/- 5.1%; saline, 20.8% +/- 2.9%; and Trolox, 8.7% +/- 4.0%; p less than 0.01). In summary, the antioxidants Trolox and ascorbic acid effectively reduced myocardial necrosis after ischemia.\r"

These methods have been associated with problems including hemostasis, suture line disruption, and pseudoaneurysm development. They have had limited application in patients without sinus segment enlargement and acute aortic dissection. Between May 21, 1986, and September 7, 1988, 90 patients (73 male and 17 female) underwent replacement of the aortic valve and ascending aorta using a composite valve graft with reattachment of the coronary ostia using a separate, smaller (10 mm) Dacron tube graft. Aortic root replacement was done alone in 41 patients (46%), in association with a concomitant cardiac procedure in 26 patients (29%), and in 23 patients (26%) undergoing cardiac reoperation with and without a concomitant procedure. Aortic arch replacement was required in 25 patients (28%). Profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest were employed in 29 patients (32%). Early survival was 91% (82/90), and there were 4 late deaths. The procedure was found to be hemostatic (only 4 patients [4%] required reexploration for hemorrhage) and durable (no reoperation for pseudoaneurysm formation was necessary).\r"

There were 6 female and 12 male patients ranging in age from 1.5 to 31.6 years (mean age, 11.9 +/- 7.8 years). Eleven had classic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with intermittent tachycardia, and 7 had a form of permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia. Five had impaired left ventricular function preoperatively. The location of the accessory conduction pathway was anteroseptal in 3, posteroseptal in 12, and both anteroseptal and posteroseptal in 3 patients. Pathway location was confirmed by intraoperative mapping in all patients. The pathways were ablated utilizing a cryoprobe at -70 degrees C. All patients survived the operation, had immediate abolishment of delta waves and tachycardia, and were considered cured at the time of hospital discharge. Sixteen (89%) remain cured at a mean follow-up of 16.9 months. One patient with a posteroseptal pathway no longer has a delta wave but has had poorly documented episodes of tachycardia and is taking medication. One other patient with both anteroseptal and posteroseptal pathways had a recurrent delta wave 6 months postoperatively but has had no tachycardia and is asymptomatic without medication. No patient experienced heart block. Ventricular function has returned to normal in all 5 patients with impaired function preoperatively. Cryoablation is an effective method of abolishing accessory conduction pathways located in the anteroseptal or posteroseptal region. The method is easy, and results are comparable with those of other techniques previously described.\r"

Internal mammary artery flow and the effects of sudden hypovolemia, gradual hypovolemia, papaverine hydrochloride, nitrates, and epinephrine were evaluated in a canine model (n = 10) (body weight, 19 +/- 5 kg) without interference from coronary artery resistance by dissecting the IMA as a pedicle, calibrating the flowmeter during free IMA flow, and anastomosing the IMA to the right atrium. Sudden hypovolemia (withdrawal of 20% of circulating blood volume over 90 seconds) caused significant modifications (p less than 0.01) of the following hemodynamic variables: heart rate (+12%), right atrial pressure (-17%), pulmonary artery pressure (-20%), wedge pressure (-30%), aortic pressure (-49%), cardiac output (-33%), distal IMA pressure (-54%), and IMA flow (-85%). During hypovolemia, IMA flow could not be increased with topical application of papaverine, but baseline values were achieved after retransfusion of the withdrawn blood volume. Gradual hypovolemia and application of large doses of nitrates showed less dramatic effects, and injection of an epinephrine bolus under normovolemic conditions increased aortic pressure and IMA flow. Under sever hypovolemia, however, administration of an epinephrine bolus provoked only a minimal increase in aortic pressure and a contrasting decrease in IMA flow. We conclude that sudden, severe hypovolemia can lead to disproportionate IMA flow reduction and that pharmacological interventions are delicate under these circumstances.\r"

A total of 62 subclavian, 14 common carotid, 6 innominate, and 2 vertebral arteries were revascularized during 79 procedures. The approach was transthoracic in 12 operations and extrathoracic in 67. Mean follow-up was 57 +/- 45 months. Two patients (2.5%) died of stroke after extrathoracic revascularization of the common carotid artery. Cumulative 5-year and 10-year freedom from neurological events was 81% and 75%, respectively. The best results were obtained with transthoracic procedures, with revascularization of the subclavian artery rather than the common carotid artery, and in operations performed in patients without associated distal carotid disease. In view of the recent progress in operative techniques and postoperative surgical care, the choice between the transthoracic approach and the extrathoracic approach should not be biased; rather, they should remain equal and viable alternatives based on anatomical and clinical features of the individual patients.\r"

During a 7-year period ending April 1985, 130 children aged 1 to 19 years underwent left-sided valve replacement. Operative mortality was 3%, 5%, and 9%, respectively, for aortic, mitral, and aortic and mitral valve replacement.

Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 8.2 years, a total of 544 patient-years. The survivors were divided into three groups based on anticoagulant treatment: warfarin sodium, aspirin plus dipyridamole, and no anticoagulants. Among the patients who had aortic valve replacement, thromboembolic complications developed in 2.5% (2.5/100 patient-years) of the aspirin plus dipyridamole group and 5% of the group given no anticoagulants. Only the warfarin group (4%) experienced bleeding complications. Among the patients having mitral valve replacement, thromboembolic complications developed in 4% of the warfarin group, 3% of the aspirin plus dipyridamole group, and 11% of the no anticoagulant group. In addition, 2% of patients in the warfarin group experienced severe bleeding. Two fatal cerebrovascular accidents occurred, both in the aspirin plus dipyridamole group. Patients who received a mitral heterograft were not prescribed any anticoagulant medications, and no thromboembolic complications developed. Among patients having double-valve replacement, complications developed in 5% of the warfarin group and 27% of the group given no anticoagulants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Left ventriculotomy has been employed in older children because of the ease of exposure in the absence of trabeculations, but concern has been raised regarding potential loss of left ventricular function. Four infants less than 4 months of age underwent repair of a large muscular ventricular septal defect by left ventriculotomy. One infant had no associated defects; 2 had undergone previous coarctation repair (1 with pulmonary artery banding); and 1 had a large secundum atrial septal defect. All had congestive heart failure refractory to maximal medical management. All patients survived, and there was no myocardial dysfunction. Echocardiographic indices of ventricular function 3 to 24 months postoperatively were normal (mean shortening fraction, 32.5%). Left ventriculotomy with patch closure of the ventricular septal defect provides a simple approach to a large muscular ventricular septal defect in infants with heart failure.\r"
