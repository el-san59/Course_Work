Hex \"B\" isoenzyme was elevated in all 38 patients hospitalized for detoxication but only 35 of these had total Hex values above the upper limit of the reference group. The Hex A isoenzyme, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase showed considerable overlap between these patients and the reference group. In the group of 22 abstinent patients only one had an increased level of Hex A, Hex \"B,\" and total Hex, whereas 10 had gamma-glutamyltransferase values above the upper limit of the reference group. It is concluded that Hex \"B\" is a useful marker for alcohol abuse.\r"

  ".W": "Based on the hypothesis that condensation products of neurotransmitters with aldehydes are involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholism, aromatic beta-carbolines (norharman and harman) were measured in the blood plasma of alcoholics and nonalcoholics. The identity of the extracted compounds was confirmed by various elution conditions of the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), newly developed radioreceptor assays, and the mass spectrum of norharman. The levels of norharman and harman in nonalcoholics were unchanged after a load with ethanol (1 g/kg body weight). The norharman levels of the alcoholics were significantly higher than that of the nonalcoholic controls (99.5 +/- 26.6 pg/ml vs. 26.9 +/- 10.7 pg/ml; p less than 0.001) and did not change significantly during a 3-week detoxication period. In the subgroup of alcoholics with delirium or hallucinosis, a slight increase of norharman during detoxication could be detected while in alcoholics with vegetative withdrawal symptoms norharman levels dropped slightly over time (p = 0.07). No difference was found with respect to harman between nonalcoholics and alcoholics. These results suggest disturbed regulatory processes in the formation and/or metabolism of norharman in alcoholics. Further investigations are needed to reveal a possible marker function of norharman in alcoholic patients.\r"

Prenatal ethanol exposure causes central nervous system and limb abnormalities in humans and in animals. Retinoic acid and didehydroretinoic acid are known to play an important role in the central nervous system and limb developments. Ethanol is known to inhibit the formation of retinoic acid from retinol and deplete hepatic retinoid levels. It is hypothesized that ethanol reduces the levels of retinoic acid in the developing embryo either by inhibiting conversion of retinol to retinoic acid and/or by depleting the level of retinol, thereby causing central nervous system and limb abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol acts as a teratogen causing brain, craniofacial, and limb abnormalities in those suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome. Normal embryonic development of the vertebrate nervous system and limbs has recently been shown to be governed by retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A. Retinol dehydrogenase is an enzyme needed to convert vitamin A (retinol) to retinoic acid, a molecule that specifies embryonic pattern formation by controlling gene expression. Ethanol acts as a competitive inhibitor of the retinol dehydrogenase activity attributed to mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme that uses both retinol and ethanol as substrates. An hypothesis is presented in which many of the abnormalities observed in fetal alcohol syndrome may be caused by high levels of ethanol acting as a competitive inhibitor of ADH-catalyzed retinol oxidation in the embryo or fetus. This would presumably result in a reduction of retinoic acid synthesis in embryonic tissues such as the nervous system and limbs that require critical levels of this molecule to specify spatial patterns.\r"

This study assessed whether the temperature profile of such infants during the 24- to 48-hour period after treatment distinguished those with from those without serious bacterial infections (SBIs). DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-one febrile infants 4 to 8 weeks old. SETTING: An urban pediatric emergency department and hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All infants underwent a sepsis evaluation (lumbar puncture, CBC/blood culture, and urinalysis/urine culture) and were hospitalized for at least 48 hours. Temperatures were measured on presentation and then every four hours during hospitalization. All infants received parenteral third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic therapy, and none received antipyretic medication unless fever was documented. Fever (rectal temperature of more than 38.0 C) was documented during the 24- to 48-hour period after presentation in 28 infants (17.6%)--one of a total of 18 infants (5.6%) with SBI and 27 of a total of 143 infants (19%) without SBI (alpha, more than .2: power .30). All bacterial isolates in cases of SBI were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics. All repeat blood and urine cultures that were performed in infants with bacteremia or urinary tract infections, respectively, were negative 24 hours after presentation. CONCLUSION: Infants 4 to 8 weeks old who remain febrile during the 24 to 48-hour period after presentation and initiation of parenteral antibiotic therapy are less likely to have SBI. This study did not have sufficient power for this difference to be statistically significant.\r"

DESIGN: The records of all children (98) were reviewed in a case-control fashion. A logistic regression model was used to determine whether there was an association between diazepam administration and intubation, adjusting for all other covariates (age, weight, convulsion time before first anticonvulsant was given, response latency, diagnosis, and therapy). SETTING: All children were treated in an emergency department and then transported to a tertiary pediatric center by a pediatric transport team. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients were children, with a median age of 2.7 years (range 0.17 to 15.3 years). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only the use of diazepam was found to be significantly associated with intubation after adjusting for all other covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 49.4; P less than .001). In the comparison of diazepam versus phenobarbital or phenytoin used as the first anticonvulsant, median response latency did not differ (27.0 vs 32.5 minutes, P greater than .83). CONCLUSION: A significant association was found between diazepam use and intubation. Response latency was not shorter when diazepam was used as the initial anticonvulsant compared with phenobarbital or phenytoin.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six complaints from a total of 154,648 ED visits yielded a frequency of 1.1 complaints per 1,000 patient visits. Main reasons for dissatisfaction were misdiagnosis, billing, and inadequate treatment; 49% of complaints were judged valid. There were 0.69 complaints per 1,000 patient visits in the nonurgent medical portion of the ED. Patients seen emergently (critical care and trauma) had a significantly lower complaint frequency of 0.08 per 1,000 patient visits (P less than .001 by chi 2 analysis).

DESIGN: Retrospective patient identification with subsequent testing of excess sera for CK-MB and total CK using an identity-unlinked procedure. SETTING: Large, urban, teaching hospital ED. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients with excess sera and one of several defined presentations chosen to identify those with possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. Patients with clearly documented noncardiac etiologies of their symptoms or signs were excluded. MAIN RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 271 patient specimens for the R-CK-MB assay compared with the S-CK-MB assay were 100%, 96.8%, 75.0%, and 100%, respectively. The R-CK-MB assay was positive for 32 patients (11.8%). Of these, eight (25.0%) were admitted to unmonitored beds, and five (15.6%) were discharged home. All of these 13 patients had initial ECGs without evidence of ischemia or infarction. On follow-up, at least eight of the 13 had evidence of infarction. CONCLUSION: The R-CK-MB assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity compared with the S-CK-MB assay. When used for patients in whom a cardiac care unit admission is not considered, the rapid assay may identify some patients with unsuspected myocardial infarction and prevent inadvertent discharge or admission to unmonitored beds.\r"

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using a physician questionnaire, record review, and telephone follow-up. SETTING: An urban, university hospital emergency department with approximately 70,000 patient visits a year. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of patients 55 years of age or older who presented for care for any reason were identified by a research associate stationed in the ED. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians managing 1,766 patients were interviewed to determine the presence or absence of 20 dichotomous clinical variables, ten of which constitute Lowe's criteria set. All patients were followed by chart review and/or telephone interview. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The determination of clinical significance was made on record review using pre-established guidelines. The SEP was ordered on 800 of the patients on the index visit. The yield of CSEA in this group was 16%. Lowe's criteria operated with a sensitivity of 0.95 (95% confidence intervals, 0.89-0.98) and a specificity of 0.10 (95% confidence intervals, 0.07-0.12) for predicting CSEAs in this population. Logistic regression analysis showed that impaired ability to communicate, acute seizures, vomiting, and prior abnormal electrolytes were independent predictors for CSEA. CONCLUSION: Lowe's criteria showed useful sensitivity but poor specificity in this population. The criteria may be used to encourage selective test ordering by physicians when a low pretest probability for CSEA exists and as part of an algorithm for emergency nurses who order tests to expedite patient care.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective blinded testing for HIV-1 antibody was performed on routinely collected blood samples. SETTING: Ten California hospitals; group 1 included three hospitals from counties of high AIDS incidence (more than 40 cases per 100,000 population), group 2 included three hospitals from counties of intermediate AIDS incidence (20 to 40 cases per 100,000 population); and group 3 included four hospitals from counties of low AIDS incidence (less than 20 cases per 100,000 population). TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients were all adult trauma victims admitted to a participating hospital through the ED during a consecutive three-month period occurring between June and November 1989. MEASUREMENTS: HIV-1 antibody testing was done using enzyme immunoassay confirmed by immunofluorescence assay. Equivocal results were confirmed by Western blot. Mann-Whitney U test, chi 2 test, and multiple logistic regression were used where appropriate. RESULTS: There were 2,264 patients with adequate blood samples for serologic testing. The seroprevalence rates for hospitals in groups 1, 2, and 3 were significantly different (chi 2 = 8.44, P = .02): Group 1, 2.5% (19 of 756: 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5% to 3.9%); group 2, 0.9% (10 of 1,078; CI, 0.5% to 1.7%); and group 3, 0.5% (two of 430; CI, 0.06% to 1.7%).

The majority of these studies have addressed the controversies of prescribing prophylactic antibiotics or suturing wounds. This study was undertaken to determine risk factors for cat bite wound infections. DESIGN: Prospective survey. SETTING: Community hospital emergency medicine residency program. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighty-six consecutive patients with 216 cat bite/scratch wounds over a two-year period. INTERVENTIONS: A standardized wound cleaning protocol with debridement and suturing, if indicated, was used. Variables analyzed included patient age and gender; wound age, type, number, location, and depth; prehospital therapy; emergency department therapy; and antibiotics used. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 19.5 +/- 15.9 years. The mean time interval from wounding to ED treatment was 10.2 +/- 39.2 hours. By anatomical sites, there were 33 (15%) head/neck, 48 (22%) arm, 97 (45%) hand, ten (5%) truncal, and 28 (13%) lower extremity wounds. By wound type, there were 122 (56%) punctures, 54 (25%) abrasions, 37 (17%) lacerations, and two (1%) avulsions. One hundred fifty (71%) of the wounds were partial thickness, and 62 (29%) were full thickness. Twenty-four (12.9%) of the patients had clinical evidence of wound infection on arrival to the ED. Five (2.7%) developed clinical evidence of infection despite ED treatment. None of the 14 (7.5%) patients with only \"claw\" injuries developed infection. The overall patient infection rate for those with cat \"bites\" was 15.6%. Factors associated with wound infections included older age (P less than .001), longer time intervals until ED treatment (P less than .0001), wounds inflicted by \"pet\" cats (P = .001), attempting wound care at home (P = .0004), having a more severe wound (P = .01), and having a deeper wound (P = .0001). Data from 148 patients who had only \"bite\" wounds and did not have clinical evidence of infection on initial presentation to the ED also were analyzed for wound infection risk factors. Wound infections were more likely to develop in patients with lower extremity wounds who did not receive prophylactic oral antibiotics (P = .071) and those with puncture wounds who did not receive prophylactic oral antibiotics (P = .085). CONCLUSION: In this study, wound type and wound depth were the most important factors in determining the likelihood of developing wound infection regardless of whether the patient was prescribed prophylactic oral antibiotics.\r"

DESIGN: The research design consisted of a mailed questionnaire disseminated in the fall of 1988 to the member institutions of the National Association of Public Hospitals (NAPH) and the Council of Teaching Hospitals (COTH). TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Study participants included hospital administrators and ED directors from 239 of the non-Veterans Administration, general acute care, US members of COTH and NAPH. MEASUREMENTS: Key measures of hospital and ED crowding including mean ED holding times for floor and ICU beds. MAIN RESULTS: Three fourths of responding hospitals reported increases in ED visits over the preceding three years. Mean ED holding times for admitted patients were 3.5 hours (median, 2.0 hours) for a floor bed and 2.9 hours (median, 1.5 hours) for an ICU bed. Half of all hospitals noted maximum waits for floor and ICU beds of ten hours or more and seven hours or more, respectively. Measures taken by hospitals to manage crowding during August 1988 included restricting access to some types of patients (mean, 3.6 days), actively transferring patients to other hospitals (mean, 2.2 days), transfer refusal (mean, 2.8 days), and total ambulance diversion (mean, 1.6 days). CONCLUSIONS: Our study strongly suggests that ED crowding is not an isolated phenomenon; ED crowding and its attendant problems appear to affect hospitals with similar adverse effects regardless of ownership. Although our results suggest that ED crowding is concentrated in metropolitan areas and in a smaller subset of hospitals, we found instances of crowding among hospitals nationwide.\r"

Clinicians also marked a visual analog scale corresponding to their estimate that each diagnostic possibility was correct. RESULTS: Experienced physicians increased their certainty more than novices (P = .014). They deviated from a standard history-physical-laboratory sequence more often than novices (P = .008).

INTERVENTION: Questionnaires requesting demographic information and including scales assessing work-related stress and depression were administered. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: A 3 x 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance in which survey site, gender, and marital status were independent variables and stress and depression scale scores were dependent variables revealed significant differences when stress and depression were analyzed simultaneously. Univariate analyses of variance revealed significant differences in stress by survey site and gender and in depression for all three independent variables. Comparison of adjusted means revealed that respondents from the United Kingdom reported significantly higher levels of stress than did respondents from the United States and that women reported significantly higher levels than men. Respondents from the United States reported significantly higher levels of depression than did respondents from the other countries, women reported higher levels than men, and unmarried respondents reported higher levels than married respondents. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations resulting from self-report bias, cross-sectional survey methodology, sampling error, and differences in training among the three survey sites, the respondents experienced similar levels of stress and depression attributable to anticipated sources.\r"

  ".U": "91032803\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate whether albumin can be substituted by less expensive plasma expanders in cirrhotic patients with tense ascites treated with total paracentesis, 88 patients (16 with renal failure) submitted to this therapeutic procedure were randomly assigned to receive IV albumin (43 patients) or dextran-70. Both substances were given at a dose of 8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed. Patients were discharged from the hospital with diuretics, and cases developing tense ascites during follow-up were treated according to their initial schedule. Total paracentesis was effective in eliminating the ascites in all but two cases in each group. Neither paracentesis plus IV albumin infusion nor paracentesis plus IV dextran-70 infusion was associated with significant changes in renal and hepatic function or serum electrolytes. The incidence of renal impairment (one case in each group), hyponatremia (three and four cases, respectively), and other complications (hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bacterial infections) after paracentesis, and the clinical course of the disease as estimated by the probability of readmission to hospital during follow-up, causes of readmission, probability of survival, and causes of death were similar in the two groups of patients. The effect of paracentesis on effective intravascular volume was indirectly assessed by measuring plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration before and 2 and 6 days after treatment, the patients being without diuretics. In patients treated with albumin, no significant changes in renin and aldosterone were observed during the entire period of observation. In contrast, both parameters increased significantly on the 6th day of treatment in patients receiving dextran-70. A significant increase in plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration (30% over baseline values) was observed in 51% of patients treated with dextran-70 and in only 15% of those treated with albumin (x2 = 10.4; P = 0.0012). These results indicate that although dextran-70 is less efficacious than albumin in protecting cirrhotic patients treated with total paracentesis from the decrease in effective intravascular volume, it appears to be capable of preventing the renal and electrolyte complications induced by this therapeutic procedure.\r"

Large deletions of human mitochondrial DNA and a transition mutation at the mitochondrial transfer RNALys gene give rise to CPEO including Kearns-Sayre syndrome and MERRF, respectively. Here we report an A-to-G transition mutation at nucleotide pair 3,243 in the dihydrouridine loop of mitochondrial tRNA(Leu)(UUR) that is specific to patients with MELAS. Because this mutation creates an ApaI restriction site, we could perform a simple molecular diagnostic test for the disease. The mutation was present in 26 out of 31 independent MELAS patients and 1 out of 29 CPEO patients, but absent in the 5 MERRF and 50 controls tested. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the mutant DNA always coexists with the wild-type DNA (heteroplasmy).\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare RETS to esophageal motility studies (EMS) in detection of motility disorders. A total of 109 consecutive patients without previous history of surgery on the esophagus underwent both RETS and EMS within one month of each other. Final diagnosis was divided into three categories: I--primary esophageal motor disorders (n = 39); II--reflux disease (n = 48); and III--non-cardiac chest pain and/or dysphagia (n = 22). Using EMS as the standard, the results of RETS were as follows: sensitivity for detection of motor dysfunction was 97%, 92%, and 77% for Groups I, II, and III, respectively, while specificity was 91% for Group II and 100% for Group III. Global sensitivity was 92% and specificity was 88%. No clinically significant motor disorders were missed by RETS. In conclusion, RETS is a useful noninvasive test for the screening of patients with symptoms thought to be of esophageal origin.\r"

It exhibited broad target-cell specificity whose pattern was distinct from that of any known growth factor. It rapidly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 145-kDa protein in responsive cells, suggesting that its signaling pathways involved activation of a tyrosine kinase. Purification identified a major polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 87 kDa under reducing conditions. Partial amino acid sequence analysis and cDNA cloning revealed that it was a variant of hepatocyte growth factor, a mitogen thought to be specific for hepatic cells and structurally related to plasminogen. Recombinant expression of the cDNA in COS-1 cells established that it encoded the purified growth factor. Its site of synthesis and spectrum of targets imply that this growth factor may play an important role as a paracrine mediator of the proliferation of melanocytes and endothelial cells, as well as cells of epithelial origin.\r"

We conclude that although the observed changes are unlikely to impair the normal patient's ability to cough effectively in these circumstances, there may be clinically significant impairment in the presence of an inadvertently high block or in a patient with pre-existing pulmonary disease.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the effects of a revised obstetric booking policy whereby all low risk pregnant women received their antenatal care entirely in the community. DESIGN--Comparison of the distribution of antenatal clinic attendances, transfers, and perinatal mortality rates for 1987 and 1989, before and after introduction of the revised policy. SETTING--West Berkshire Health District. SUBJECTS--All women who delivered with a registrable birth in the district in 1987 (5817 women) and 1989 (5372). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Attendances at community and consultant antenatal clinics; bookings transferred from community care to consultant care; perinatal mortality rates. RESULTS--Of 5372 women delivering in West Berkshire in 1989, 3185 (58.3%) were originally booked for general practitioner-midwife care, of whom 1567 (49.2% of general practitioner-midwife bookings) were transferred to consultant care. 1618 women (30.1% of all women delivered) received their entire obstetric care from general practitioners and midwives. Attendance at hospital antenatal clinics was reduced by 16%. In 1989 the perinatal mortality rates (1987 values) for the district were 6.3 (7.6) per 1000 births overall; 8.2 (8.3) per 1000 consultant bookings; 5.0 (4.7) per 1000 for community bookings; and 10.2 (14.4) per 1000 for women transferred to consultant care. CONCLUSION--Antenatal care of low risk pregnant women may safely be provided by their general practitioner and midwife.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether previously found geographical correlations between leukaemia incidence and exposure to radon are reflected in a detectable mutagenic effect on individuals, the frequency of mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (hprt) in peripheral blood T lymphocytes was measured in subjects with known domestic radon concentrations. These concentrations were measured in December, 1989, in houses in Street, Somerset, UK, by passive alpha-track radon detectors. 20 non-smoking subjects aged 36-55 years were selected from the patient list at the local health centre on the basis of the radon concentrations in their homes--the range selected varied by a factor of ten. Blood samples for preparation of T lymphocytes were taken in July, 1990. There was a significant association between the log mutant frequency and radon concentration (t = 3.47, p less than 0.01). A second analysis of a further set of radon measurements (October, 1990, to January, 1991), in both living rooms and bedrooms, and repeated mutant frequency determinations also showed a significant relation, which remained significant even after exclusion of the highest frequency and adjustment for subject's age and cloning efficiency. These data must be regarded as preliminary and further more extensive studies should be done to determine whether the observed association is causal.\r"

  ".W": "The hormone gastrin plays an important role in the regulation of acid secretion in the stomach which, in turn, stimulates the digestion of food. Previous studies reported that administration of beer and wine but not ethanol and spirits increases gastrin secretion in fasting volunteers. It is not known whether alcoholic beverages combined with a normal meal have an additional effect on the postprandial gastrin response. We therefore measured the gastrin response in eight volunteers who received either alcoholic beverages (40 g alcohol) in the form of beer, red wine or spirits, or mineral water as control in combination with a dinner. Two glasses were drunk before the meal, two glasses during the meal. Plasma gastrin concentrations were twofold increased at one hour after the dinner as compared to predinner values. However, no additional effect of beer, wine or spirits on this postprandial response was seen. The present study does not support the hypothesis that the consumption of beer or wine during a meal has a positive effect on the release of gastrin and therefore most probably does not contribute to an improved digestion of food by stimulation of acid secretion.\r"

Group III was fed the hamster ethanol liquid diet (ethanol amounting to 36% of total calories). Group IV was fed the ethanol diet to which 4-methylpyrazole (20 micrograms/litre) was added. Groups I, II and III were group-fed the amount consumed by Group IV on a daily basis. Upon killing the animals, blood alcohol levels were found to be elevated in Group IV but not in Group III. Hepatic methionine synthetase (MS) was inhibited in Group IV. Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase was induced in this group to compensate for the MS inhibition and liver betaine was lowered reflecting this induction. None of these changes were seen in Group III. Since none of the animals showed an aversion to their respective diets and gained weight normally, these data indicate that it was the elevated blood levels of ethanol rather than nutritional factors that were related to the changes in methionine metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of Acamprosate (the calcium salt of an acetylated form of homotaurine) and the benzodiazepine-receptor agonist Diazepam, were investigated on the alcohol-induced behavioural preference towards alcohol following chronic alcoholization by inhalation. We also examined the effects of Acamprosate and Diazepam on the blood alcohol level (BAL) and on the cortical microvascular network. Acamprosate (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg daily per os during the alcoholization period) did not significantly reduce either BAL or alcohol-induced cortical hypervascularization. Increasing dosages of Acamprosate (i.e. 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day), however, progressively reduced preference for alcohol as expressed in a free choice beverage procedure, whereas 400 mg/kg/day of Acamprosate immediately stopped this behaviour. Acamprosate (50 mg/kg/day) also reduced the spontaneous activity of rats during the withdrawal syndrome. By contrast, Diazepam (5 mg/kg) induced inversion in the animals' choice (i.e. increased water consumption versus decreased alcohol intake) during the same experimental procedure, and potentiated the alcohol-induced hypermotility of the animals during the withdrawal syndrome without altering cortical hypervascularization. Taken together, our data provide evidence that both substances exert dose-dependent effects on preference towards alcohol, but display opposite profiles on spontaneous motor activity during the withdrawal phase without any modification of brain microvascularization or blood alcohol levels.\r"

The average rates obtained were, respectively, 621, 447 and 596 nmol/h/mg cellular protein. Cultures of these three cell types, containing known quantities of cellular protein per flask, were incubated with 0 or 2 mg ethanol/ml for 72 h and the culture supernatants subjected to affinity chromatography on blue sepharose CL-6B. Pure albumin fractions obtained in this way were adjusted to the same optical density and tested for cytotoxicity against A9 cells. The data showed that the albumin fractions obtained from ethanol-containing macrophage cultures were considerably more cytotoxic than those obtained from ethanol-containing cultures of PLC/PRF/5 and Hep G2 cells. It appeared that, for a given quantity of ethanol metabolised, considerably more acetaldehyde was released extracellularly by macrophages than by the two hepatoma cell lines and that this acetaldehyde bound to albumin to form cytotoxic acetaldehyde-albumin complexes. The data raise the possibility that macrophages are an important source of extracellular acetaldehyde and circulating acetaldehyde-albumin complexes in vivo.\r"

Chronic treatment with verapamil, but not saline, dose-dependently attenuated alcohol intake, without significantly influencing water intake. These findings suggest that verapamil exerts an inhibitory action on ethanol preference in chronically alcohol-drinking monkeys, possibly by interfering with Ca(2+)-channels and/or by interacting with the activity of certain central neurotransmitters.\r"

The results confirmed our previous in vivo experiments pointing out long-lasting effects of maternal alcohol exposure in the offspring.\r"

  ".U": "91345660\r", 
  ".W": "We previously found that, in the hippocampal formation as well as other central nervous system regions, withdrawal from alcohol following long periods of ingestion did not impede the ethanol-induced degenerative changes, including cell loss: on the contrary, neuronal degeneration was found to be increased in withdrawn rats. By grafting withdrawn rats either with immature hippocampal blocks or with suspensions of cultured astrocytes, we hoped to arrest the process of cell loss or even reverse it, because it is known that grafted material might display trophic and eventually protective effects in conditions of brain damage. The dentate granule and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells were counted both in the grafted hemisphere and in the contralateral one. Grafts of astrocyte suspensions did not interfere with the ongoing process of cell death in withdrawn rats. Conversely, grafts of hippocampal tissue impeded the degeneration observed in the granule and pyramidal cells of the grafted hemisphere, although in the contralateral one the cell loss persisted. We therefore conclude that the protective effect displayed by solid grafts might be a local process dependent on the release of diffusible trophic agents. We cannot explain the absence of any effect displayed by astroglial grafts, inasmuch as in different experimental situations such an effect was described.\r"

(2) The urinary concentrations of total, free and conjugated PYD were unaltered by ethanol feeding. In contrast, there were significant reductions in total and conjugated DPD concentrations. The reduction in the concentration of free DPD did not achieve statistical significance. The urinary PYD/DPD molar ratios, of total and conjugated forms, were increased. (3) Alcohol feeding caused the total 24 hr urinary PYD excretion to fall slightly, by 15%. There were no statistically significant effects on excretion of free and conjugated forms of PYD, nor on the free/total, free/conjugated and conjugated/total molar ratios. In contrast, the 24 hr urinary excretion of total, free and conjugated DPD was significantly reduced by 25-55%. Furthermore, the free/total and free/conjugated molar ratios were significantly increased by 40% and 80%, respectively, and the conjugated/total molar ratio was significantly reduced by 16%. (4) Data from the analysis of plasma electrolytes, enzymes and metabolites did not support the contention that the effects on collagen degradation were a result of secondary organ dysfunction due to alcohol consumption. (5) The results suggest that chronic ethanol feeding for 6 weeks is having a primary effect on skeletal tissue. A reduction in the absolute rate of bone resorption is implicated and ethanol may inhibit the normal formation of the mature crosslinks.\r"

One control group was derived from the Emergency Room patients and matched for age and sex; the other group (44 men, 22 women, mean age 48.7 years) was randomly selected from the general out-of-hospital population. There were 50 patients with supraventricular tachycardia, 30 with atrial flutter, and 19 with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. Coronary heart disease (14% of patients), hypertension (10%), and dilated cardiomyopathy (6%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases associated with the arrhythmias. The self-reported alcohol consumption of patients with arrhythmias during the week preceding the arrhythmia did not differ significantly from that of hospital or population controls, although significantly more patients than controls had liver enzyme levels above normal; neither were there any significant differences between the groups regarding prevalence for alcoholism as judged by the CAGE questionnaire. The results were essentially similar when patients with supraventricular tachycardia and those with intra-atrial tachyarrhythmias (flutter and paroxysmal tachycardia) were separately compared with the controls. We conclude that alcohol consumption, although a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, is not associated with the induction of other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients of working age.\r"

The Adolescent Alcohol Involvement Scale was administered to 82 males and females aged between 13 and 16 to distinguish among drinkers, problem drinkers and non-drinkers. To measure social skills, the Adolescent Problem Inventory was administered to boys and the Problem Inventory for Adolescent Girls to girls. There were significant group differences on the social skills measures with non-drinkers receiving the highest scores, indicating the most social skills, followed by drinkers and problem drinkers. An analysis of results showed that 11% of drinkers and 50% of problem drinkers were in the incompetent range of social skills performance while no non-drinkers scored in this range. None of the problem drinkers scored in the highly competent range of performance whereas 22% of drinkers and 40% of non-drinkers did. Results are discussed in terms of linking a number of problem behaviours in adolescence, such as drinking, smoking and delinquent behaviour, to deficits in social skills.\r"

In addition, 11% and 3%, respectively, reported a history of previous or current heavy consumption. The lifetime prevalence of alcohol consumption disorders is significantly higher in males than females, while current disorders are significantly more common in younger than older individuals. Based upon the number of reported symptoms, patients reporting current disorders appear to have a more serious form of disease than patients reporting a past disorder. We conclude that disorders of alcohol consumption are common in our medical practice. Moreover, our findings suggest that many patients do recover from alcohol consumption disorders (i.e. are currently symptom-free by self-report) and disease severity may be an important factor in this process.\r"

Discriminant analysis of each type of hospitalization and total hospitalizations for each sex revealed an increased risk of seizure activity correlating with non-detoxification hospitalizations, but the correlation was weaker than that observed for detoxification admissions and for total admissions. This correlation between hospitalizations and seizure prevalence supports the hypothesis that recurrent alcohol withdrawal may have a kindling effect.\r"

This review concludes with a discussion of the risk of developing second malignancies. Although this complication is infrequent, the likelihood that survivors of childhood cancer will develop a second malignancy is 10 times that of age-matched controls. This phenomenon in part relates to genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and host susceptibility. These qualifications not withstanding, most studies implicate central nervous system radiation with and without chemotherapy as the primary etiology for second malignancies.\r"

Severe cerebral necrosis was established at 3 months of age. Of the 11 children with this pattern (group A), 8 had severe and 3 had moderate cerebral palsy on subsequent examination. Thirteen children (group B) had normal late MRI scans; none developed severe cerebral palsy or marked mental retardation. Two children (group C) had focal ischemic lesions.

Increased intracranial pressure was the most common presentation. All patients had hemorrhage at the falcotentorial junction near the incisura; 5 also had hemorrhage around the tentorial leaflet. Posterior fossa retrocerebellar subdural hemorrhage developed in 5 patients and posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage developed in 4. All 6 patients who received conservative treatment had normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Of the other 3 patients upon whom suboccipital craniotomies were performed, only 1 had a normal outcome. Although it localized the tentorial subdural hemorrhage either at the incisura area or at the tentorial leaflet, ultrasonography failed to identify all patients with retrocerebellar or posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage. Parturitional tentorial subdural hemorrhage may not be uncommon. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are complementary in the diagnosis. Surgical decompression of the posterior fossa subdural hematoma is necessary only in the presence of acute hydrocephalus or signs of brainstem compression.\r"

All 7 children with congenital cortical blindness remained blind on subsequent examination. Of the 27 children with acquired blindness, 16 (59%) had poor visual outcome. Poor visual outcome occurred in those with cardiac arrest, hypoxia, status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, and head trauma. Good visual outcome occurred in children with hypotensive episodes after cardiac surgery. Of the 12 children with recovery of vision, the interval from acute loss of vision to partial or total recovery was 2 weeks to 5 months. Seven children had complete recovery of vision with no residual visual field defect. The majority of children (87%) had focal or multifocal spike-and-waves and slow sharp-wave discharges on electroencephalography. None had photic recruitment response or occipital spike-and-wave discharges. Flash visual evoked potential studies performed during acute episodes of cortical blindness documented 11 with absent response, 10 with bilateral increases in latency, and 6 with normal responses. There was no correlation between normal visual evoked potentials and a good visual outcome. Only 2 of 6 children with normal responses had normal vision. Abnormal or absent responses are more predictive of a poor recovery of vision because only 3 of 21 (14%) had normal vision on subsequent examination. Abnormal electroencephalographic findings with focal or multifocal spike-and-wave discharges or cerebral atrophy on cranial computed tomography are also poor prognostic signs.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 9 preterm infants at 37-43 weeks postmenstrual age. They all were born at 26-35 weeks gestation. Myelination was graded according to its most cephalic location. Myelination pattern 2 (myelination observed in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent structures of the thalamus and lenticular nucleus) was demonstrated in 2 infants, pattern 3 (myelination of the corona radiata) in 3 infants, and pattern 4 (myelination of the centrum semiovale) in 4 infants. Bilateral low intensity areas were found on T1-weighted images in 7 infants and a ribbon-like, high intensity was observed in 5. These findings revealed a wide variety of magnetic resonance imaging appearance in apparently normal preterm infants. Caution is needed in interpreting the pathologic nature of such features in preterm infants during the perinatal period.\r"

  ".W": "Although brainstem immaturity has been postulated as one of the pathogenesis underlying cyanosis during feeding (CDF), there has been no widely accepted physiologic parameter that reflects brainstem function. We recently proposed that the dissociation index (DI), one of the phasic sleep parameters, is a reliable and quantitative sleep parameter for assessing brainstem maturation during early infancy. In the present study, we evaluated brainstem impairment in infants with CDF using phasic sleep components. Polysomnographies were obtained for 12 infants with CDF who were equally divided into 2 groups: one had or subsequently experienced apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome (ALTE-SIDS group) and the other did not (CDF group). Rapid eye movement density and the number of gross movements (body movements, including the trunk, lasting greater than or equal to 2 sec) in the patients were identical to those in the controls. In the CDF group, the decrease of the average DI value from the controls was significantly less than the decrease in the ALTE-SIDS group. CDF may be a mild expression of brainstem immaturity. DI appears to be useful when evaluating infants with cyanosis during feeding.\r"

All 3 patients developed ventricular dilatation; in the 2 patients with periventricular leukomalacia, the ventricular border was irregular in the outer (dorsal) margin, and interhemispheric fissures were widened as a manifestation of cerebral atrophy. Furthermore, the thalamic inner (ventral) margins of the lateral ventricles were irregular in all 3 patients. This previously unrecognized finding points to a particular form of cerebral atrophy localized in the gangliothalamic region that contributes to the development of ventriculomegaly. The reported sonographic sequence implies profound damage in the thalamus and basal ganglia in asphyxiated infants which undoubtedly has contributed to the poor outcomes of our patients.\r"

The novel features of these patients were classic orobuccal-lingual dyskinesias, their young ages, and the association with asthma and theophylline. The movements resembled tardive dyskinesias of older patients on neuroleptics, but neither patient had any exposure to neuroleptic drugs. Choreiform movements were moderately severe and remitted several hours after discontinuation of theophylline or over days in the patient who remained on the drug. No symptomatic treatment of dyskinesia was required. Both infants otherwise had normal neurologic examinations with no clinical evidence of meningoencephalitis, seizures, or stroke. Both infants required hospitalization for respiratory distress, but not intensive care. The highest theophylline levels measured in these patients were 22 and 25 micrograms/ml and levels determined closest to the appearance of dyskinesias were lower. Urine toxicology screen for other drugs and routine blood work were normal. The infants, examined subsequently for 1 1/2-2 years for asthma, have demonstrated no reappearance of dyskinesias or other neurologic abnormalities. We propose an interaction of theophylline, hypoxemia, or other factors related to asthma in the pathophysiology of reversible dyskinesia in our patients.\r"

This study asked: 1) What changes occur in tcO2 and laser-Doppler blood flow with increasing compressive weight; and 2) do these measures respond differently to increasing weight? An indenter was used to apply incremental weight to the trochanter of healthy volunteers. During the first session, tcO2 was measured, and laser-Doppler blood flow was measured during the second session. The mean values of tcO2 and laser-Doppler blood flow were analyzed for significant changes over the range of applied weight. If significant change occurred, the polynomial that best described the data was determined. Mean values for tcO2 showed a significant decrease with increasing compressive weight. Its decrease was described by a second degree polynomial (quadratic). The weight that resulted in the tcO2 reaching zero for individual subjects ranged from 400-1000. Mean values for laser-Doppler blood flow showed a significant decrease with increased weight. The decrease was best described by a first degree polynomial (line), which is a different pattern from the tcO2. Laser-Doppler blood flow continued to decline with increasing weight beyond the point where tcO2 reached zero. During low-flow states, tissue oxygen utilization may exceed oxygen delivery and lead to ischemia even though capillary closure has not occurred.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of surface cooling on intra-articular temperature was examined in dogs' knees. Four treatment protocols were examined: local ice compress application for 5, 15 and 30 min and local ice bath immersion for 15 min. Intra-articular temperatures were recorded using a needle microprobe inserted into the knee and continuous temperature recordings were made before, during and after the treatment. Rectal temperatures were also simultaneously recorded. Intra-articular temperatures rapidly dropped during icing. Five minutes of ice compress application resulted in a 2.2 +/- 1.2 degrees C intra-articular temperature drop with no change in rectal temperature. After 15 min of ice compress application, the joint temperature fell 4.1 +/- 1.3 degrees C with no change in rectal temperature. Thirty minutes of local ice compress application dropped the knee temperature 6.5 +/- 4.0 degrees C with a slight 0.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C drop in rectal temperature. Fifteen minutes of ice water immersion caused a much greater drop in intra-articular temperatures (20.2 +/- 8.4 degrees C) than could be achieved with ice compress. Rectal temperatures fell slightly during immersion (1.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C). After the removal of any type of cryotherapy, intra-articular temperatures continued to drop for several minutes and then a prolonged rewarming period commenced. The mean time required to return to baseline intra-articular temperature varied from 22-60 min, depending on the type and duration of cryotherapy. We conclude that brief periods of topical cold application to a dog's knee can induce significant and long lasting depression of intra-articular temperatures and that this is a local effect not dependent on core temperature cooling.\r"

The feedback subjects were shown an EMG signal of the inspiratory muscles of the upper thorax and a signal indicating their current breathing phase (inspiration or expiration). The no feedback subjects only saw the breathing phase signal. The subjects' ability to control muscular activity was assessed as the relative increase in EMG from expiration to the subsequent inspiration. Analysis of variance with group and session as factors showed that feedback subjects performed significantly better, although the improvement in performance over the sessions by the two groups was not significantly different. These results lend some support to the clinical use of EMG feedback in breathing therapy aimed at changing the thoracoabdominal distribution of ventilation. However, further research for improving learning is necessary.\r"

The cause for this is unknown, but may be the result of higher motor unit firing rates during the activity, which leads to excessive fatigue of the motor units. The purpose of this study was to determine whether postpolio subjects recruited motor units at higher firing rates than control subjects. Twelve control and seven postpolio subjects were tested for maximal voluntary contraction of the quadriceps isometrically. Randomly, subjects performed isometric contractions for five 10-s periods freely against gravity (threshold) and at 20% and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction. Decompositional motor unit electromyographic analysis was used to measure motor unit amplitude, motor unit firing rate and counted number of motor units identified. Analysis was by univariate analysis of variance. Motor unit firing rate was not significantly greater (P greater than 0.05) in postpolio subjects than control subjects at all three levels of contraction. Thus, it is unlikely that an increased motor unit firing rate leads to the deficit in recovery of strength in postpolio subjects.\r"

Neurologic presentations were diverse and included hemiparesis, diffuse cognitive dysfunction and dementia, myelopathy, myopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Other patients were referred for wound care as well as the management of the local effects of Kaposi's sarcoma, various musculoskeletal syndromes and new onset blindness. Problems identified included impaired mobility (76%), difficulty with self-care (57%), impaired cognition (29%) and uncontrolled pain (37%). Among the rehabilitation interventions utilized were therapeutic exercise (73%), gait aids (45%), bathroom and safety equipment (45%), orthotics (29%), vocational counseling (4%), pain management (29%) and whirlpool treatments (10%). Five patients were too ill or refused treatment. We conclude that AIDS patients referred for rehabilitation have a wide variety of physical deficits, demonstrate a considerable degree of functional impairment and may require multiple rehabilitation interventions.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if the ankle plantarflexor (PF) and dorsiflexor (DF) muscle groups of the preferred leg are more or less affected than the nonpreferred one in a mixed sample of myotonic and limb-girdle patients. Measurements of lower limb preference were made as well as of PF and DF evoked and voluntary contractile responses. Isometric contractile properties and peak values for torque production during maximum isometric twitch and voluntary contractions were measured. No significant difference was found in terms of contractile properties between the preferred and nonpreferred leg for both DF and PF muscle groups, except for the large PF twitch torque observed in the nonpreferred side (P less than 0.05). These results, however, reveal a clear tendency for both muscle groups on the preferred side to be weaker than those on the nonpreferred side. This last finding, in conjunction with the equally if not presumably stronger PF/DF muscles on the preferred leg of healthy adult subjects, would suggest that the equivalent bilateral muscle force observed in the present study may be interpreted as giving support to the hypothesis that overwork or overuse of dystrophic muscles may be harmful in weakening the musculature.\r"

Analysis of variance indicated significant main effects for speed for time to onset of EMG activity and force plate recordings, time to swing toe-off and heel-strike and stance toe-off. However, when the dependent variables were expressed as a percentage of the initiation cycle, no significant main effects were noted. For the second study, two force plates were utilized, and reflective markers were placed on the sacrum and anterior superior iliac spines. The timing of heel-strike of the swing limb and toe-off of the stance limb showed a high degree of coordination in both experiments (r = 0.95 and 0.98). It was concluded that the relative invariance of selected parameters indicates that gait initiation is centrally programmed. It also appears that the swing limb, although forces were very small, is responsible for the initial weight shift to the stance limb and that the stance limb is then primarily responsible for the generation of momentum.\r"

From a baseline saliva flow rate, saliva flow decreased an average of 30% with one-patch and 59% with two-patch dosing. No significant side effects were observed with treatment, and the decrease in drooling was maintained for a 4-month period. Although transdermal scopolamine may represent one acceptable facet of long-term treatment, it must be stressed that efficacy is variable across patient populations and that treatment approaches must be individualized.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence has shown that Hodgkin's disease (HD) is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a substantial number of cases and that in these cases EBV DNA is localized exclusively to Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. The virus genome is not silent in RS cells because two EBV latent gene products, latent membrane protein (LMP) and EB early region (EBER) transcripts, have recently been reported to be expressed in RS cells. However, little information is available about the possible activation of EBV replicative genes in HD. This prompted us to investigate HD biopsies from 96 patients for expression of replicative gene products. Cryostat sections were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies to protein BZLF1, which controls the switch between EBV latency and replication, and also to LMP. LMP was demonstrated in RS cells in 47 cases (49%). Three of the LMP-positive cases (6%), but none of the LMP-negative cases, expressed the BZLF1 protein. BZLF1 positively was confined to rare RS cells. These three cases showed no detectable early, virus capsid, or membrane antigens. Our findings show that activation of EBV immediate early genes occurs only infrequently in RS cells, indicating that control of viral latency is not severely impaired in HD patients.\r"

  ".U": "91346822\r", 
  ".W": "Between April 1985 and March 1987 130 children and adolescents up to 18 years of age with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were registered on the stratified and randomized multicentric trial ALL-REZ BFM 85 designed for patients pretreated with intensive front-line therapies. Stratification criteria were time and site of relapse: bone marrow (BM) relapse on or up to 6 months after stopping front-line therapy (group A), BM relapse beyond 6 months after therapy (group B), and isolated extramedullary relapse at any time (group C). Treatment consisted of alternating courses of polychemotherapy including randomly administered high- or intermediate-dose methotrexate (HDMTX:12 g/m2 as 4-hour infusion; IDMTX: 1 g/m2 as 36-hour infusion). During maintenance therapy the patients received daily oral thioguanine and biweekly intravenous (IV) MTX. The overall second complete remission (CR) rate was 92% (groups A, B, and C: 88%, 92%, and 100%), and the probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 6 years is 0.31 +/- 0.04 (groups A, B, and C: 0.18 +/- 0.05, 0.30 +/- 0.07, and 0.72 +/- 0.11). HDMTX did not prove to be superior to IDMTX, which led to premature stopping of randomization. Risk factor analyses showed early relapse, particularly BM relapse within 18 months, and T-cell phenotype to be independent predictors of poor outcome. The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapses following BM relapse was 19%, indicating that reprophylaxis to the CNS with IV/intrathecal (IT) MTX was insufficient. For 17 children who received bone marrow transplantation in second CR from HLA-compatible siblings the EFS was 0.53 +/- 0.12 at 5 years. Their outcome was not influenced by the above-mentioned risk factors. With the proposed treatment regimen long-lasting second remissions can be achieved in about one third of patients even after intensive front-line treatment.\r"

  ".U": "91346823\r", 
  ".W": "H65-RTA is an immunoconjugate that consists of the A chain of ricin (RTA), a ribosomal-inhibiting protein, coupled to a murine monoclonal antibody (H65) directed against the pan-T-cell antigen CD5. The CD5 antigen is heterogeneously expressed on cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tumor cells, but is not expressed on normal cells except lymphocytes. A phase I trial was therefore conducted in which 14 patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma progressive on other therapies were treated with up to three cycles of H65-RTA. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of H65-RTA was 0.33 mg/kg/d administered intravenously for 10 days as defined by dyspnea at rest at higher doses. Other reversible side effects included myalgia, mild hypoalbuminemia with weight gain, pedal edema, fatigue, fevers, and chills. Six patients received more than one cycle of H65-RTA without increased side effects compared with the first cycle. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that peak serum drug levels were dose-dependent, and ranged from 1.13 to 5.56 micrograms/mL, with a terminal half-life ranging from 1.0 to 2.9 hours. The development of antibodies against the immunoconjugate was associated with a lower peak drug level, but not with enhanced side effects. Partial responses lasting from 3 to 8 months were documented in four patients. Three of the responding patients received more than one cycle of H65-RTA in the presence of anti-immunoconjugate antibodies. The results from this phase I trial suggest that H65-RTA is an active drug in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The immunoconjugate may be safely administered repeatedly, even in the presence of anti-immunoconjugate antibodies, with responses noted. Additional studies at the MTD are needed to define the response rate in this disease.\r"

CT was 9-day 6-thioguanine, ara-C, and daunorubicin (TAD9) in newly diagnosed AML and sequential high-dose ara-C and mitoxantrone (S-HAM) for relapse. In patients whose bone marrow was free from blasts a continuous intravenous infusion of GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2/d started on day 4 after CT. Thirty-six patients entered the study and 30 of them did receive GM-CSF. For comparison, a historical control group of 56 patients was used. Complete remission rate was 50% (18 of 36) versus 32% in controls (P = .09), and early death rate was 14% versus 39% (P = .009). Treatment with GM-CSF was not associated with major adverse events. Two patients showed a marked leukemic regrowth that was completely reversible in one patient and appeared to be GM-CSF independent in the other patient. Remission duration does not seem to be reduced after GM-CSF. Under GM-CSF the blood neutrophils recovered 6 and 9 days earlier in the TAD9 (P = .009) and S-HAM (P = .043) groups associated with a rapid clearance of infections in most patients. We conclude that GM-CSF was of therapeutic benefit to our patients and this provides a basis for larger controlled trials.\r"

The patient's clinical status improved throughout the treatment and no major side effects were observed. Serial monitoring showed blockage of the myeloma cell proliferation in the bone marrow (from 4.5% to 0% myeloma cells in the S-phase in vivo) as well as reduction in the serum calcium, serum monoclonal IgG, and the serum C-reactive protein levels. The serum calcium and serum monoclonal IgG corrected by approximately 30%, whereas the C-reactive protein corrected to undetectable levels during treatment. No major side effects developed, although both platelet and circulating neutrophil counts decreased during anti-IL-6 therapy. A transient immunization was detected 15 days after the initiation of the treatment, which could explain the recovery of myeloma cell proliferation after 2 months of treatment (2% myeloma cells in the S phase). In conclusion, this first anti-IL-6 clinical trial demonstrated the feasibility of injecting anti-IL-6 MoAbs, and also a transient tumor cytostasis and a reduction in IL-6-related toxicities. It gave insight into the major biologic activities of IL-6 in vivo and may serve as a basis for further development of anti-IL-6 therapy in myeloma and other IL-6-related diseases.\r"

Because elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have been correlated with the development of transplant related complications, we conducted a phase I-II trial of pentoxifylline (PTX), a xanthine derivative capable of down-regulating TNF-alpha production, in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing BMT. Thirty consecutive adult patients (median age, 34) were entered and received either an allogeneic (n = 26) or autologous (n = 4) BMT. Patients were enrolled at increasing dose levels (1,200, 1,600, and 2,000 mg/d) from day -10 through day +100 posttransplant. PTX was well tolerated with no significant adverse side effects noted at any of the dose levels administered. The actuarial day 100 survival for these 30 patients was 90% (95% confidence interval 79% to 100%). When compared with a good risk control group, PTX recipients experienced less mucositis (3.7 +/- 1.1 v 18.7 +/- 1.1 days, P = .004), less hepatic venocclusive disease (10% v 65%, P = .001), a lower incidence of renal insufficiency (3% v 65%, P = .0003), required less days of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (24.0 +/- 1.3 v 35.0 +/- 2.4, P = .001) and were discharged from the hospital earlier than controls (day 26.0 +/- 1.8 v 37.0 +/- 3.8, P = .01). In addition the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) greater than or equal to grade II was also reduced among the PTX recipients (35% v 68%, P = .03). PTX at doses in excess of 1,200 mg/d further reduced the severity of mucositis, and TPN requirements resulting in earlier hospital discharge than patients receiving 1,200 mg/d of PTX. In this study oral administration of PTX in doses up to 2,000 mg/d was well tolerated and associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing BMT. Prospective randomized trials are currently in progress to test these preliminary observations.\r"

  ".U": "91346828\r", 
  ".W": "Unlike allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), autologous BMT is not accompanied by immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects; hence, the relapse rate observed after autologous BMT in malignant hematologic disorders is higher than that observed after allogeneic BMT. Autologous BMT represents a much safer medical procedure available for many patients in need in situations where allogeneic BMT is not feasible or risky. The present experiments were designed to investigate whether it might be possible to combine the therapeutic benefits of autologous BMT with additional immunotherapy after BMT. The tumor model used for investigating GVL effects was the murine B-cell leukemia (BCL1), a spontaneous, nonimmunogenic, highly lethal leukemia of BALB/c origin. BALB/c mice inoculated with 10(3) BCL1 leukemia cells were treated on day-1 with cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg and transplanted with normal syngeneic BM cells on day 0. High-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) (100,000 Cetus units x 3/day intraperitoneally x 5 consecutive days) was initiated on day +1, +7, or +21 after BMT. Kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution after syngeneic BMT indicated a steep increase in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes on days 17 through 24. All experimental groups were observed for relapse. Mice receiving no rIL-2 therapy relapsed and died within 50 days after BMT, whereas mice receiving rIL-2 showed long-term disease-free survival. Optimal time for administration of rIL-2 was noted at 3 weeks post-BMT, with 90% of the mice surviving with no evidence of disease for more than 1 year. Similarly, when 10(4) BCL1 cells were given 1 day after syngeneic BMT to simulate minimal residual disease after syngeneic BMT, rIL-2 therapy administered at 14 days post-BMT seemed effective in prolonging disease-free survival in contrast to the same regimen given at 1 day after BMT. Our data suggest that immunotherapy with rIL-2 should be further investigated as a new immunotherapeutic tool for decreasing the relapse rate after BMT for hematologic malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "Platelets have been shown to release osteonectin on thrombin stimulation. The origin of platelet osteonectin was unclear as it may have been synthesized by megakaryocytes or it may have been endocytosed from plasma as other platelet alpha-granule constituents are. Platelet osteonectin has a larger apparent molecular size than the bone species, although the molecular basis for this difference has not been elucidated. These two issues have been addressed here by (1) examining the potential for osteonectin biosynthesis in human megakaryocytes by demonstrating the presence of osteonectin mRNA in purified megakaryocytes, and (2) comparing the coding portion of osteonectin transcript in megakaryocytes to the size of its bone counterpart. Because of the limitations of cell population purity and in obtaining sufficient numbers of megakaryocyte cells for Northern analysis, we have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of human osteonectin mRNA in megakaryocyte and megakaryocyte-depleted bone marrow cells. Isolation of RNA, cDNA synthesis, and PCR were performed on human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells, enriched megakaryocytes, and megakaryocyte-depleted cells. Restriction enzyme analysis of PCR DNA products confirmed the identity of the products as those encoding osteonectin for all three cell populations studied. In addition, the sizes of DNA indicate that osteonectin genomic DNA, nuclear RNA, or altered transcript were not amplified, and that the transcript from megakaryocytes is the same size as that from bone cells. These data suggest that the difference in protein size between platelet and bone osteonectin is due to posttranslational modification. To overcome the possibility that megakaryocyte signal originated from contaminating cells (less than 5% by cell count), all three cell populations were diluted to less than one cell per tube and PCR amplification was performed. Limiting dilution analyses demonstrated the presence of osteonectin mRNA in single megakaryocytes as well as in single cells from the cell population depleted of megakaryocytes, suggesting the capacity for osteonectin biosynthesis in all cells studied. The procedure we describe in this report can be used to examine specific characteristics of mRNA molecules in heterogeneous cell populations and in situations where only small quantities of cells can be obtained.\r"

  ".W": "Mice with W mutations characterized by hypopigmentation, sterility, anemia, and mast cell deficiency have abnormalities in c-kit, a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. Recently, the ligand for c-kit was cloned by investigators in several laboratories. Zsebo et al identified and cloned a gene for a cytokine termed stem cell factor (SCF) in the medium conditioned by buffalo rat liver cells, and this cytokine proved to be c-kit ligand. We have examined the effects of recombinant rat SCF (rrSCF) on colony formation from primitive hematopoietic progenitors in culture. rrSCF and erythropoietin (Ep) supported formation of granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colonies as well as a small number of multilineage and blast cell colonies from marrow cells of normal mice. We then examined the effects of rrSCF using marrow and spleen cells of mice that had been treated with 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Unlike single factors, combinations of factors such as rrSCF plus interleukin-3 (IL-3), rrSCF plus IL-6, and rrSCF plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) markedly stimulated the growth of multilineage colonies. In contrast to these factor combinations and a combination of IL-3 and IL-6, a combination of rrSCF and IL-4 did not support multilineage colony formation. Mapping studies of the development of multipotential blast cell colonies further indicated that rrSCF, like IL-6, G-CSF, and IL-11, shortens the dormant period in which the stem cells reside. When we tested the effects of rrSCF using pooled blast cells, which are highly enriched for progenitors and are devoid of stromal cells, rrSCF plus Ep supported formation of only a few multilineage colonies, indicating that rrSCF itself is ineffective in support of the proliferation of multipotential progenitors. However, rrSCF supported formation of a significant number of neutrophil and neutrophil/macrophage colonies from pooled blast cells, indicating that rrSCF is able to support directly the proliferation of progenitors in neutrophil/monocyte lineages. c-kit ligand may play important roles in adult hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to assess the presence of endogenous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) within adherent layers of human Dexter-type cultures and to investigate the effect on granulomonopoiesis of adding exogenous GM-CSF to the culture medium. The presence of GM-CSF was demonstrated using a bioassay, in which adherent layers from normal bone marrows gave rise to endogenous granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) that were specifically inhibited by increasing amounts of an anti-GM-CSF neutralizing antibody. Using an immunoassay, the estimated amounts of GM-CSF were less than or equal to 40 pg per flask in adherent layers, while remaining undetectable in supernatants. The addition of 10 ng or purified recombinant GM-CSF per milliliter of culture medium increased slightly the CFU-GM output over a 5-week culture period. The addition of 50 ng/mL decreased significantly the CFU-GM output after 5 weeks of culture. This decrease was associated with major modifications of the adherent layer cell composition. Large round or ovoid macrophages were generated at the expense of the interdigitated and elongated stromal cells and the extracellular fibronectin network was no longer observed. These studies suggest that GM-CSF production by accessory cells (stromal cells and/or monocytes) is almost equal to its consumption by hematopoietic cells, a situation similar to that found in long-term cultures of murine marrows. They also show that the maintenance of granulomonopoiesis is decreased by adding more than 10 ng/mL of exogenous GM-CSF to the culture medium, which is related to the induction of adherent macrophages, the disappearance of the major smooth-muscle-like stromal cell component of the adherent layer, and that of the fibronectin extracellular matrix.\r"

These cell mixtures were injected into lethally irradiated hosts. Functional abilities of donor marrow populations were assessed after 3, 6, and 12 months as percentages of donor type Hb and GPI in the host's circulating erythrocytes and lymphocytes, respectively. Bone marrow from mice treated with two doses of 5-FU 3 to 5 days apart was severely affected, producing circulating erythroid and lymphoid cells an average of only 25% of normal for doses 3 days apart, and 14% of normal for doses 5 days apart. Two doses of 5-FU administered 1 day or 8 days apart had much smaller effects, producing circulating cells 75% or 58% of normal. Thus, most PHSC are stimulated to proliferate rapidly 3 to 5 days after treatment with 5-FU, but far fewer PHSC proliferate as early as 1 day, or as late as 8 days, after the 5-FU treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Very high concentrations of erythropoietin (epo), in clonogenic cultures, result in reduced production of neutrophils, and fetal progenitors are more sensitive to this effect of epo than are those of adults. However, the significance of this observation is unclear because no evidence of reduced neutrophil production has been presented following administration of recombinant epo to human or animal subjects. In the present study we injected newborn rats, beginning on the first day of life, with 20, 200, or 2,000 U epo/kg body weight, and measured serum epo concentrations after 2, 8, 24, or 48 hours. After selecting a dose that resulted in serum concentrations greater than 1,000 mU/mL (a concentration that resulted in down-modulation of neutrophil production from neonatal rat progenitors in vitro) other newborn rats were treated for 3 days with that dose (1,000 U epo/kg) or a vehicle control. Administration of epo resulted in increased hematocrits (P less than .001), reticulocyte counts (P less than .001), normoblasts/femur (P less than .05), and normoblasts/spleen (P less than .001). Recipients of epo also had more erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) (P less than .001) and higher CFU-E tritiated thymidine suicide rates (P less than .01) than did controls. However, femurs and spleens of epo recipients contained fewer postmitotic neutrophils (femur, P less than .01; spleen, P less than .01), proliferative neutrophils (femur, P less than .01; spleen, P less than .02), granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) (P less than .005), and lower CFU-GM tritiated thymidine suicide rates (P less than .01). Seven and nine days after twice-daily administration of 2,000 U epo/kg, blood neutrophil concentrations had diminished (P less than .05). Thus, administration of high doses of recombinant epo to newborn rats resulted in diminished neutrophil production accompanying accelerated erythropoiesis.\r"

Two distinct IL-1 receptors (IL-1R) are expressed on different cell types: the 80 Kd IL-1RI on T cells and fibroblasts, and the 68 Kd IL-1RII on B cells and myelomonocytic cells. The presence and functionality of IL-1R on vascular cells has been investigated by using polyomatransformed mouse endothelial cell (EC) lines (sEnd.1 and tEnd.1). These cells expressed specific and saturable binding sites for IL-1 (1,273 sites per cell with kd 9.5 x 10(-11) mol/L for sEnd.1, and 771 sites per cell with kd 8.5 x 10(-11) mol/L for tEnd.1, with radioiodinated IL-1 alpha as ligand). Binding of IL-1 was also evident at single cell level by autoradiography. By cross-linking studies, the molecular weight of the IL-1 binding protein on EC was approximately 80 Kd. This was confirmed by the presence in EC of mRNA for the 80 Kd IL-1RI. The IL-1RI on EC was apparently functional, since EC responded to IL-1 with IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6 bioactivity production. These results were extended to human EC and vascular smooth muscle cells, which were also found to express mRNA for IL-1RI.\r"

PBMC cultured without human serum made little IL-1ra or IL-1 beta. In the presence of 1% AB serum, there was no increase in IL-1 beta (0.25 +/- 0.13 ng/mL) but IL-1ra production increased sevenfold to 3.4 +/- 0.5 ng/mL. IgG (2.5 to 100 micrograms/mL IgG) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (1 to 100 ng/mL) had no significant effect on IL-1 beta production but increased IL-1ra production up to 18-fold (18.2 +/- 3.9 ng/mL). Using endotoxin as a stimulant, 82% +/- 2% of IL-1ra was secreted in comparison with 52% +/- 9% of IL-1 beta. Culture conditions of PBMC influenced the production of IL-1ra but not IL-1 beta. Rocking endotoxin-stimulated PBMC produced 75% less IL-1ra but the same amount of IL-1 beta when compared with PBMC cultured in stationary plastic tubes. Rocking IgG-or GM-CSF-stimulated PBMC also produced 75% to 80% less IL-1ra. GM-CSF or IL-1 beta at concentrations that elicited submaximal production of IL-1ra potentiated IgG-induced IL-1ra production. The production of IL-1ra and IL-1 beta are under differential regulation because serum, IgG, and GM-CSF were potent stimuli for the production of IL-1ra but not IL-1 beta, and the prevention of cell-cell contact of PBMC reduced IL-1ra but not IL-1 beta production.\r"

Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) alone (P less than .01) and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone (P less than .01) caused significant stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from four CD3+ LGL leukemia patients, as measured in a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. Recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) alone had no effect (P = .11). The combination signals of anti-CD3 MoAb and either IL-2 or IL-4 produced a proliferative response greater than anti-CD3 MoAb alone (P less than .01) or lymphokine alone (P less than .01). Leukemic LGL, purified by two-color sorting, were subsequently activated by anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2 and assessed for DNA content by viable Hoechst No. 33342 (HO) staining. Results of these studies demonstrated that leukemic LGL were stimulated directly by anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2, with the percentage of cells in cell cycle (S + G2/M) ranging from 16% to 72%. Normal CD3+ LGL were also stimulated to enter the cell cycle by anti-CD3 and IL-2. These results show that leukemic LGL proliferate in vitro after activation through the T-cell receptor and/or lymphokine.\r"

BMT patients had decreased cell growth with only a 1.35 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 1.24 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for NHL), and 0.8 +/- 0.1 (allogeneic BMT for leukemia) mean fold increase by day 5 of culture compared with controls (4.0 +/- 0.4), P less than .001. Anti-CD3 + IL-2 activated cells from patients with ALL and NHL who had received autologous BMT and cells from patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic BMT were more effective in lysing the natural killer (NK) sensitive target, K562, and the NK-resistant target, Daudi, compared with controls. In contrast, cytolysis of K562 and Daudi by cultured PBMCs from patients with ALL and NHL receiving multi-agent chemotherapy was similar to that of controls. Cultures from BMT recipients had a significant increase in CD16+ (autologous ALL 5.7 +/- 1.5%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 12.4 +/- 3.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 14.3 +/- 2.9%, P less than .001) and CD56+ cells (autologous ALL 27.6 +/- 12.0%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 39.3 +/- 9.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 42.7 +/- 7.4%, P less than .001) compared with controls (CD16+ 2.5 +/- 0.4%; CD56+ 6.9 +/- 0.9%).

Although the survival and growth of WEHI-274.3 cells in vitro is absolutely dependent on the addition of exogenous growth factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or colony-stimulating factor-1, when injected into syngeneic mice the cell line is tumorigenic. Sera from normal mice contain low levels of an activity that sustains survival of WEHI-274.3 but does not stimulate growth. In contrast, sera from mice bearing the WEHI-274.3 leukemia contained levels of CSF-1 and GM-CSF that stimulated the growth of WEHI-274.3 cells. Supernatants of cultures of WEHI-274.3 cells contained an activity that stimulated 3T3 fibroblasts to release an activity that stimulated the growth of the WEHI-274.3 cells. The 3T3-stimulatory activity released by the WEHI-274.3 cells was neutralized completely with an antiserum specific for murine IL-1 alpha, but not with antiserum specific for IL-1 beta. Moreover, WEHI-274.3 cells both in vitro and in vivo contained high levels of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNAs. The leukemia-stimulatory activity released by the 3T3 cells was neutralized by an antiserum specific for GM-CSF. We postulate that the IL-1 alpha constitutively released by the WEHI-274.3 cells stimulates the production of GM-CSF from host cells such as fibroblasts or endothelial cells. A similar paracrine mechanism of growth stimulation may occur in acute myeloid leukemias in humans.\r"

These cases represented 6.1% of 410 newly diagnosed ALLs (two treatment protocols) and 16.8% of 95 AMLs (two protocols). T-lineage--associated antigens were identified in 9 of the My+ ALL cases and in 14 of those classified as Ly+ AML; all but 1 of the 19 cases that could be subclassified had an early thymocyte stage of differentiation. The My+ ALL cases had an increased frequency of French-American-British (FAB) L2 morphology (36%); the Ly+ AML cases were characterized by FAB M1 or M2 morphology, low levels of myeloperoxidase reactivity and combined populations of myeloperoxidase-positive large blasts and small blasts generally of hand-mirror morphology. Karyotypic abnormalities included t(9;22)(q34;q11) in three cases of My+ ALL, 11q23 translocations in two cases of My+ ALL, and 14q32 translocations in three My+ ALL and five Ly+ AML cases. Mixed-lineage expression lacked prognostic significance in either ALL or AML; however, the findings indicate that some patients with Ly+ AML may respond to prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase after failing on protocols for myeloid leukemia. At relapse, two My+ ALLs had converted to AML and two Ly+ AMLs to ALL; one case in each group showed complete replacement of the original karyotype. Acute mixed-lineage leukemia does not adequately describe the heterogeneity of the cases identified in this study and should be replaced by a set of more restrictive terms that indicate the unique biologic features of these leukemias.\r"

While polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) morphology was normal, several neutrophil motile functions were found to be altered in the patient. Furthermore, two siblings had died in infancy with a similar clinical picture, raising the possibility of an inherited neutrophil defect. Random migration and chemotaxis, assessed by the under agarose method, were profoundly impaired. Actin polymerization, as measured by flow cytometry of N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phallacidin (NBD-phallacidin)-stained PMNs, showed lower basal F-actin and a 1.75-fold increase in response to 10(-7) mol/L formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) compared with a 4.51-fold increase in control. Microscopic examination of NBD-phallacidin-stained PMN spread on glass showed decreased area of spreading and F-actin-rich filamentous projections distinct from control. The early phase of FMLP-induced right angle light scattering was absent, similar to the effect caused by cytochalasin-B (CB), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Accordingly, FMLP induced secretion of elastase without the addition of CB. Staphylococcus aureus killing was 50% of control whereas superoxide production response to FMLP and surface expression of CD11b were greater than twice normal. Partial defects in actin polymerization and scatter were seen in the parents and release of elastase, in the absence of CB, was also increased in both parents. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of whole cell proteins from the patient showed a marked decrease in an 89-Kd protein (8% of control) and a marked increase in a 47-Kd protein (4.2-fold). Both mother and father had decreased 89-Kd (77% and 42% of control) and increased 47-Kd proteins (2- and 3.4-fold), although neither had recurrent infections or chemotactic defects. These studies describe a new inherited actin dysfunction syndrome associated with severe propensity to fungal infection and draw attention to the proteins of apparent molecular weights of 89 Kd and 47 Kd, which may be of great importance in the regulation of actin polymerization in human PMNs.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils from healthy elderly donors generate significantly less diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) than neutrophils from young donors, following stimulation by the chemotactic peptide, formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (FMLP). The defect in signal transduction occurred at a point proximal to the generation of IP3 and DAG, since the reduction in FMLP-induced superoxide generation was corrected if the intervening signal transduction steps were bypassed, either by priming with a substimulatory dose (1.62 nmol/L) of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), by ionophore elevation of cytosolic calcium, or by using a stimulatory dose of PMA (1.62 mumol/L). FMLP receptor number and affinity were unaffected by aging. On FMLP activation, neutrophils from old, as compared with young, volunteers showed significantly greater and more long-lasting decreases in the concentrations of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). This indicates a reduction with age in the metabolically active precursor pools responsible for the generation of IP3 and DAG. In contrast, aging had little effect on the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), which has recently been suggested to serve as a major activator of the NADPH oxidase. This may explain why the decrease in IP3 and DAG production was not accompanied by a comparable decrement in superoxide generation, which was only 17% lower in the old than in young donor neutrophils. Thus, aging is associated with reductions in the concentration of critically important phosphoinositides, resulting in diminution in the ability to produce key second messengers. Although the aged neutrophil is largely able to compensate for the decrements in signal transduction, its reserve capacity is compromised, making it particularly vulnerable to external insults that also impair function.\r"

These cells, which express only their adult globin genes, will transcribe the human adult beta gene but not the fetal gamma genes when they are introduced on an intact human chromosome 11 by cell fusion. However, MEL cells stably transfected with the human A gamma gene attached to one of the active elements (HS2) of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) readily produce gamma-globin mRNA in amounts equivalent to those seen with a comparable beta gene insert. When both beta and gamma genes are attached to HS2, equal amounts of beta A gamma mRNAs are produced, irrespective of the gene order. Furthermore, when HS2 is inserted into the 5' end of a 40-kb cosmid containing the G gamma A gamma-117 delta beta genes in their normal chromosomal organization (but with the Greek HPFH -117 A gamma gene mutation), it directs expression of readily detectable amounts of G gamma A gamma and beta-globin mRNAs in MEL cells. Therefore, under these circumstances we have observed no competition between beta and gamma genes for expression in MEL cells. These findings suggest that MEL cells are capable of perpetuating regulatory information involved in developmental control when it is provided by an intact chromosome, but are incapable of reconstructing such information on transfected DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) and hereditary elliptocytosis are closely related, congenital disorders of the red blood cell usually associated with defective spectrin self-association and abnormal limited tryptic digestion of the N-terminal of domain of spectrin. Enhanced cleavage by trypsin of spectrin from affected individuals at arginyl residue 45* and lysyl residue 48* frequently yields increased amounts of an alpha 1/74-Kd fragment at the expense of the normal alpha 1/80-Kd parent fragment. Limited tryptic digestion of three unrelated individuals with HPP showed the alpha 1/74 defect. To ascertain the molecular defect responsible for the abnormality, the structure of exon 2 of the alpha-spectrin gene was examined. Genomic DNA from the subjects was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using primers flanking exon 2. Restriction endonuclease digestion of amplified products showed the loss of the HindIII site at codons 47 and 48 in one allele of subject 1 and abolished the AhaII site at codons 27 and 28 in one allele of subjects 2 and 3. Nucleotide sequence analysis of subcloned amplified DNA from the HPP subjects showed three novel amino acid substitutions. In subject 1 (a black individual), a single base substitution (AAG----AGG) at codon position 48 changes amino acid residue lysine to arginine. In subject 2 (a white individual), a single base substitution (CGT----AGT) at codon 28 changes arginine to serine. In subject 3 (a black individual), a different base substitution at position 28 (CGT----CTT) changes arginine to leucine. These mutations occur at positions of the alpha l domain where other mutations have also been described, indicating that the normal residues at these positions play an important role in spectrin dimer self-association and thus, in membrane stability.\r"

  ".W": "The high rate of severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is related to the profound immunodeficiency posttransplant. Because cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been implicated in resistance to viral infections, we examined the restoration of the CMV-specific CTL response in 20 patients who received bone marrow from HLA-matched, CMV-seropositive donors. Blood specimens were obtained from patients at 1, 2, and 3 months after BMT and from the donors on a single occasion. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cocultured with CMV-infected donor-derived fibroblasts for 2 weeks and then tested for cytotoxicity against CMV-infected and uninfected autologous or HLA-mismatched fibroblasts. Cytolytic activity was detected in all 20 donors, with specificity for autologous CMV-infected targets demonstrable in 17 (median CMV-specific lysis at an effector:target ratio of 15:1 was 32%, range 18% to 83%). Specific lysis was mediated by CD8+, class I-restricted T cells, as shown by inhibition with anti-class I monoclonal antibody and by selective depletion of effector cells. By contrast, CMV-specific CTL were detected in only 10 of 20 patients after BMT (median lysis 29% at 3 months post-BMT). None of these 10 patients developed CMV pneumonia, whereas 6 of the 10 patients with an undetectable CMV-specific CTL response after BMT died with CMV pneumonia. These results demonstrate that restoration of CMV-specific CTL responses may require an extended time period after BMT in some patients, and that such patients are at increased risk of developing severe CMV disease. Approaches to reconstitute CMV immunity in BMT patients by adoptive transfer of CMV-specific CD8+ CTL clones derived from the bone marrow donor are now being pursued.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five pediatric patients who received bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were studied prospectively to determine the relationship between BMT and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) infection by the virus isolation from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow and by determining neutralizing antibodies to HHV-6 during the 2 months following BMT. All of the 25 donors and the recipients were immune to HHV-6 at the time of BMT and the virus was not isolated from them. HHV-6 was isolated from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow mononuclear cells in ten (40%) of the 25 recipients between day 14 and day 22 of BMT, but not from any other day. Two additional recipients showed a significant increase in the antibody titer. Thus, infection with HHV-6 was confirmed in 12 (48%) of the 25 recipients. Four of the 12 developed skin rashes; three of these four had a febrile episode when the virus was isolated, whereas none of the remaining 13 developed the skin rash. These results suggest a frequent infection with HHV-6 only a few weeks after BMT and a close association between the infection with the virus and the development of skin rashes.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To find out if breast carcinomas diagnosed in the 1980s differ from those diagnosed a few decades ago. DESIGN--Retrospective comparative cohort study. SETTING--City of Turku, south western Finland. PATIENTS--439 patients with breast carcinoma diagnosed in 1945-65 with a median follow up of 27 years (95% of all those histologically diagnosed in Turku); and 370 patients with breast carcinoma diagnosed in 1980-4 with a median follow up of 6 years (94% of all those histologically diagnosed in Turku). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Breast cancer incidence, mortality from breast cancer, age at diagnosis, stage of cancer, seven histological factors, DNA ploidy. RESULTS--Age adjusted incidence of breast cancer increased from 30.8/100,000 person years in 1953-7 to 62.2/100,000 in 1983-7; mortality in breast cancer increased from 16.7 to 17.2/100,000 person years. Survival of patients with stages II to IV (but not with stage I) improved. The mean age at diagnosis increased from 55.5 years in 1945-55 to 62.5 years in 1980-4 (p less than 0.0001); the proportion of patients with T0-1 carcinomas increased from 13% to 41% (p less than 0.0001) and with pN0 carcinomas from 43% to 55% (p = 0.003) from 1945-65 to 1980-4. There was no change in histological type or DNA ploidy of breast cancer, but in the 1980-4 cohort carcinomas were more often well differentiated, had lower mitotic counts and less nuclear pleomorphism, more often had a well defined tumour margin, and had less tumour necrosis. There was, however, no difference between the two cohorts in these histological characteristics except for tumour necrosis when they were compared in a multivariate log linear model at a given size of primary tumour. CONCLUSION--Improved survival with breast cancer can at least partially be explained by detection of increased numbers of small carcinomas with favourable histological characteristics.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of hospital case records identified from the regional health authority's computer; validation of the primary source with hospital clinic registers and community paediatric registers. SETTING--Northern region, excluding South Cumbria District Health Authority (659,300 children under 16 in 1981). PATIENTS--All children diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes before the age of 16 and resident in the region at time of diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Incidence rates for the 10 year period and analysis of incidence rates within categories of deprivation. RESULTS--919 incident cases were identified. The validation procedure covered 54% of all cases identified and gave 95% completeness of ascertainment. The average annual incidence over the 10 year period was 14.8/100,000 for girls and 13.4/100,000 for boys. The annual incidence for the most and least deprived areas of the region was 18.7/100,000 (95% confidence interval 16.2 to 21.5) for boys and 7/100,000 (5.6 to 8.8) for girls. There was a highly significant trend (p less than 0.001) of decreasing incidence with decreasing level of deprivation. CONCLUSIONS--In the north of England the incidence of childhood diabetes is related to material deprivation.\r"

DESIGN--Observational study on children with epithelial cell antibody presenting with unexplained renal or skin disease. SETTING--General paediatric department and regional paediatric nephrology unit. PATIENTS--Six children (five girls, one boy), who presented to the unit in 1989-90. RESULTS--Three children, two of whom had a history of a hyperpigmented rash, presented with hypertension, proteinuria, and impaired renal function. Renal biopsy specimens from two of these children showed severe arteriolar endothelial cell swelling with arteriolar occlusion. These children fully recovered after treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The third child developed end stage renal failure and required dialysis. Three other children presented with an unusual cutaneous eruption but no evidence of renal disease. Histology of the skin lesions showed acute epidermal necrosis and features consistent with a viral infection. CONCLUSIONS--The aetiology and pathogenesis of the epithelial cell antibody are unknown. These cases indicate that it may have a role in native kidney disease and focal epidermal necrosis. Clinical and histological features suggest that the antibody may be associated with a viral infection.\r"

DESIGN OF INTERVENTIONS--Double blind, randomised crossover trial with two active periods in which budesonide was given in divided daily doses of 200 micrograms and 800 micrograms. During run in and two washout periods placebo was given. After the second washout period the children received open treatment with 400 micrograms budesonide daily. All periods were of 18 days' duration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Growth of the lower leg as measured twice a week by knemometry. RESULTS--Mean growth velocity of the lower leg was 0.63 mm/week during run in and during washout 0.64 mm/week. Budesonide treatment was associated with a significant dose related reduction of growth velocity: the mean reduction in growth velocity during treatment was 0.11 (95% confidence interval -0.15 0.36 (0.13 to 0.59) mm/week with 800 micrograms budesonide (p less than 0.05; Page's test). During treatment with 400 micrograms budesonide a reduction of 0.17 (-0.10 to 0.45) mm/week was found. CONCLUSIONS--Treatment with inhaled budesonide is associated with a dose related suppression of short term linear growth in children with mild asthma.\r"

About a dozen United States promoters have joined with Mexican colleagues to offer a variety of treatments. Some patients are diagnosed using standard methods prior to arrival at the clinics, but many healthy individuals are misdiagnosed as having cancer or \"precancer\" and are then treated there. Others are told they have been cured or are improving even though they still have active disease. The modalities and regimens used are often referred to as \"metabolic therapy\" and, for the most part, are either not based on sound scientific principles or have been shown in controlled clinical trials to be useless or even dangerous. A basic metabolic regimen consists of three phases: detoxification with fasting and bowel cleansing, strengthening the immune system with numerous \"supplements,\" and attacking cancer with \"natural and non-toxic\" chemicals. Popular treatments include injections of hydrogen peroxide, large quantities of pressed liver and carrot juice, coffee enemas, infusions of Laetrile mixed with massive doses of vitamins and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), special diets, and a host of other pseudoscientific regimens. Unfortunately, no evidence exists that any of these modalities is more effective than no treatment at all. Patients traveling to the Mexican border clinics for metabolic therapy are subjecting themselves to costly and hazardous regimens, especially if they forgo responsible medical care in the process. The American Cancer Society, therefore, strongly urges individuals with cancer not to seek treatment with metabolic therapies in the Mexican border clinics.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To highlight the mechanisms, common causes and management of stroke in the elderly. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for articles published from 1967 to 1990. The following key words were used: \"stroke,\" \"cerebrovascular disease,\" \"elderly,\" \"aging,\" \"hypertension,\" \"drug interactions,\" \"etiology,\" \"evaluation,\" \"management\" and \"recovery of function.\" Original articles with large series of patients were reviewed in detail. STUDY SELECTION: Of about 750 original articles reviewed 116 were finally selected for detailed analysis. Those that dealt with cause, pathophysiologic features and management of stroke with emphasis on the elderly were chosen. DATA SYNTHESIS: With increasing age the incidence of stroke increases, cardiovascular reserve decreases, catecholamine responsiveness diminishes and cardiac arrhythmias become more common. Blood pressure, especially systolic, rises, and the benefits of its treatment become both more difficult to assess and less certain. In the elderly population embolic stroke, particularly that due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, is seen with increasing frequency. Because of postural hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias and overmedication, watershed infarction occurs more frequently with increasing age. Amyloid angiopathy now represents the most common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the altered drug metabolism and pharmacodynamics in the elderly the therapeutic armamentarium is growing, and so are the risks of such treatments. Stroke in the elderly poses unique problems that deserve distinctive solutions. Further research is needed to study the effect of cerebral ischemia to understand better how the older brain handles the stress of the ischemic insult.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess a possible relation between the incidence of hypertension during pregnancy and the consumption of fatty acids found in fish and sea mammals. DESIGN: Retrospective survey of pregnancy-induced hypertension; prospective diet survey. SETTING: Inuit women from seven communities in the Keewatin region of the Northwest Territories. PATIENTS: All women from Arviat (formerly Eskimo Point), Baker Lake, Chesterfield Inlet, Coral Harbour, Repulse Bay, Sanikiluaq and Whale Cove who gave birth between Sept. 1, 1984, and Aug. 31, 1987. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All blood pressure measurements recorded during the pregnancy, incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension in the seven communities, harvest of country food (food obtained from the land or sea rather than bought in a store) for six of the communities, self-reported consumption of fish, sea mammals and terrestrial mammals by a subgroup of the subjects and levels of phospholipid fatty acids in cord serum samples from a subgroup of the infants. MAIN RESULTS: Significantly lower mean diastolic blood pressure values during the last 6 hours of pregnancy were noted for the women from the three communities with a higher consumption of fish and sea mammals (78.2 [95% confidence limits (CL) 76.6 and 79.9] mm Hg) than for those from the four communities with a lower consumption of such food (81.5 [95% CL 80.1 and 82.9] mm Hg) (p less than 0.005). The relation between community diet type and blood pressure was independent of other factors. Correspondingly, the women from communities with a lower consumption of marine food were 2.6 times more likely to be hypertensive during the pregnancy than those from communities with a higher consumption of marine food (p less than 0.007). Parity (p less than 0.05) and prepregnancy weight (p less than 0.005) were also significantly associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension; however, the relation between hypertension and community diet type remained significant in logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 2.56, p = 0.03). The differences between the community groups were substantiated by the results of the diet survey, the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the cord serum phospholipids and the harvest data. CONCLUSIONS: Increased consumption of fish may be beneficial for women at risk for hypertension during pregnancy. A prospective randomized trial of fish or EPA supplementation during pregnancy is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To compare two strategies for searching MEDLINE using the CD Plus/MEDLINE program on compact disc. DESIGN: Comparison study. INTERVENTIONS: Two search strategies were designed and executed for each of two topics (patient recruitment to clinical trials and attitudes of patients, the public and health care professionals toward clinical trials). Strategy A: searches based on key words selected from the medical subject heading (MeSH) tree structure. Strategy B: searches based on MeSH terms most frequently used to index a known set of relevant articles. Defined search restrictions were then applied. The effects of the restrictions on the absolute number of citations retrieved and on the proportion of relevant citations were assessed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of articles retrieved, number of relevant articles, precision and recall of each search strategy and overlap between strategies. MAIN RESULTS: Strategy A produced more citations than strategy B (recruitment 147 v. 38, attitude 366 v. 57) but had more inappropriate citations (recruitment 75 v. 17, attitude 265 v. 25). Both strategies produced 73 relevant recruitment citations and 101 relevant attitude citations. In the recruitment search although the precision did not differ significantly between strategies A and B the difference in recall was significant (98.6% v. 28.8% respectively, p less than 0.0001). In the attitude search strategy A had a lower precision than strategy B (27.6% v. 56.1%, p less than 0.0001) but a much higher recall (100% v. 31.7%, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Strategy A would be more valuable to researchers doing extensive reviews, whereas strategy B would be useful for the busy clinician who simply wants a few appropriate references quickly and is willing to sacrifice comprehensive retrieval in the interest of efficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The earliest preparations of immunoglobulins (Ig) decreased the susceptibility of agammaglobulinemic patients to infections caused by pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, meningococci, streptococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intramuscular administration of such preparations was painful and traumatic, especially for children. Ethanol-fractionated Ig could not be administered intravenously (IV) because the IgG molecules tended to aggregate and thus were more likely to produce anaphylactoid reactions. New Ig preparations, isolated at low pH (e.g., pH 4) in the presence of traces of pepsin to inhibit reaggregation, were well tolerated when administered IV. Thus a new era of treatment and prophylaxis of disease using IV Ig (IVIG) was launched. The IVIG preparations revolutionized the management of virtually all immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by failure of antibody responses. Amelioration of antibody deficiency secondary to certain chronic diseases or surgical trauma can be achieved with these preparations. Newer uses of IVIG include treatment of some autoimmune diseases; in some conditions, the beneficial influences may be attributable to antiidiotype antibodies present in the IVIG. Another likely explanation is that IVIG inhibits damage to cells and tissues by antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or blocks phagocytosis that is facilitated by Fc receptor mechanisms. The value of IVIG in preventing infection in patients undergoing bone marrow or organ transplantation and in the treatment and prophylaxis of life-threatening infections in neonates and premature infants also is reviewed.\r"

There seem to be both immediate and long-term effects of IVIG in ITP which may be explained by mechanisms of action other than immunoglobulin G substitution. The mode of action of IVIG could correspond to interference with Fc receptors on phagocytes or be a result of antiidiotypic antibodies in IVIG that may induce secondary changes in the complex immunologic network. These immunomodulatory effects were the basis for the use of IVIG in the treatment of patients with other immune-related disorders. New aspects regarding definition and treatment of ITP, the possible mechanisms of action of IVIG, and the implications thereof are discussed and updated.\r"

  ".W": "It has been almost 10 years since the observations on the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Over the next decade, IVIG was used in other types of autoimmune diseases. Much work has also been done on gaining a better understanding of the mechanism(s) by which IVIG exerts its effects in these autoimmune diseases. This review examines the proposed mechanisms of action of IVIG and establishes a rationale for the use of this type of therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune connective tissue disorders. Currently, only anecdotal reports are available on the treatment of SLE with IVIG. Nevertheless, studies thus far suggest that IVIG may be useful in selected SLE patients with cytopenias and cutaneous vasculitis and may have a steroid-sparing effect in patients with SLE and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In SLE patients with renal disease, it should be used cautiously because some patients have worsening of their renal function with IVIG infusions. These preliminary experiences suggest that multicenter controlled trials on the therapeutic use of IVIG in SLE and other connective tissue disorders would be important.\r"

Hypogammaglobulinemia is present in about 20% to 70% of patients with CLL. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) supplementation (400 mg/kg body weight every 3 weeks) prevented bacterial infections in these patients. An ongoing study is being conducted to compare doses of 250 mg/kg/mo with those of 500 mg/kg/mo in 36 patients included so far. As of this writing, the rate of infection in the two treatment groups was not significantly different, and no substantial loss of protection against bacterial infection was found in the lower-dose group. It seems likely that the lower dose is almost as effective as the standard therapy. If this is so, cost savings would be substantial.\r"

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations may benefit HIV-infected children and adults with recurrent bacterial infections at doses of 200 to 400 mg/kg every 2 to 4 weeks. In addition, IVIG (1 to 2 g/kg) is effective at raising platelet counts to hemostatic levels in HIV-infected patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and life-threatening bleeding. Indirect evidence also suggests that IVIG may be effective in preventing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Finally, recent studies suggest that specific anti-HIV antibody preparations may have a therapeutic role, either as immunoglobulin concentrates or as immunoadhesions and immunotoxins. However, further investigations are needed to exclude antibody enhancement of HIV infection by the Fc receptor or the complement receptor.\r"

Experiences using IVIG to treat patients with severe infectious diseases, Kawasaki disease, and ITP are reported in this article. In patients with severe infections, IVIG showed some clinical benefits. In patients with Kawasaki disease, combined administration of IVIG and aspirin reduced the incidence of coronary artery lesions below that of aspirin alone or without therapy, and persistence of these lesions also decreased in patients who received combination therapy. Organ platelet sequestration, measured with indium 111-labeled platelets, showed a splenic pattern in good responders to IVIG, a hepatic pattern in fair responders, and a splenohepatic pattern in poor responders. These patterns might provide some insight into the use of IVIG. Some reaction mechanisms also are discussed.\r"

Immune suppression due to transfusion has been implicated, though this remains unproven. We have conducted a retrospective study of 69 patients (38 transfused, 31 not transfused) with squamous carcinoma of the larynx to assess the effect of blood transfusion on survival after laryngectomy. Patients were compared for age, sex, smoking habit, tumour site and stage, grade of operating surgeon, preoperative haemoglobin, tumour nucleolar organizer region status, and operation time. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. In the transfused group 21/38 died as a result of their malignant disease and only 4/31 in the untransfused group. This difference was highly significant (P less than 0.001, chi-squared test) and using a multivariate analysis the only variable associated with a decreased survival time was whether a blood transfusion had been received. We conclude that peri-operative blood transfusion is associated with decreased survival after laryngectomy. However, whether this association is causal remains unproven.\r"

A quantity of pus was aspirated at the first attempt from 91 patients (53%); 82 of these required no further aspiration but 7 required a further single aspiration and 2 required a further 2 aspirations before resolution of the sepsis. 71 of the 81 patients (88%) from whom pus had not been aspirated, and who were therefore initially considered to have peritonsillar cellulitis, required no further aspirations. However, 6 subsequently drained pus spontaneously and 4 produced a positive aspirate on a second occasion. Four patients required a change in their antibiotic therapy. We have found the combination of needle aspiration and parenteral antibiotics to be an effective treatment of peritonsillar sepsis. All patients were spared the unpleasant and painful experience of an incision and drainage procedure.\r"

Post-operative cholesteatoma occurred equally frequently with the two canal wall down methods (7.7 and 7.3%, respectively) but was more frequent after intact canal wall surgery (23.3%). Hearing was better and the infection rate lower with obliteration than with open cavity techniques. Post-operative infection was the least frequent and the hearing result best in the intact canal wall ears, but compared to the other two groups the extent of disease found at surgery was considerably less in this group. The obliteration operation proved to be a safe method in the hands of a practising otologist outside university clinics.\r"

They were also strongly related to the site of the primary tumour, its T-stage and its histological grade, being more common in tumours of the oro or naso-pharynx, in poorly or moderately differentiated tumours, and in tumour stages T3 or T4 at presentation. There were also interactions between these tumour factors, and patients with all three factors had a 25% incidence of bilateral nodes. 126 of these patients could be matched for the main prognostic factors with 126 patients with unilateral neck node disease. The survival rate of the latter group was 9% better than that of the unilateral group. Further breakdown showed that the survival of patients with nodes smaller than 6 cm is not affected by laterality, whereas it is for patients with massive nodes.\r"

Audiometric measurements indicate that hearing thresholds of the elderly are influenced by numerous disease processes. Patients attending hospital with hearing impairment are at greater risk of having a vascular or biochemical abnormality than a group of elderly 'non-complainers'. Elderly patients presenting with hearing loss should therefore be adequately investigated before being labelled as having presbyacusis.\r"

In 17 dissections (57%), the nerve was readily accessible in the floor of the round window niche without undue risk to the round window membrane or the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal. In 5 bones (16%), the nerve was closely related to the round window membrane and could not have been approached without significant risk of damage to the membrane. In 8 (27%), the nerve ran more or less directly medially to the internal auditory meatus without entering the round window niche. The ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal would therefore have been at risk if the nerve were approached surgically.\r"

We report our experience with six pediatric cases presenting to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation over the past eight years. Unusual findings in our patients included ascitic fluid without eosinophilia and eosinophilic pericarditis (one patient), and eosinophilic cholecystitis (one patient). Endoscopic examination and biopsy helped to establish the diagnosis in all patients. Bone marrow aspiration supported the diagnosis by demonstrating eosinophilia and identifying reactivation of the disease, even in cases without peripheral eosinophilia. All six patients responded promptly to prednisone. Diagnosis is challenging and eosinophilic gastroenteritis may be more common than is recognized. This series of cases significantly expands the spectrum of the disease in children, and documents the usefulness of diagnostic endoscopy in this condition.\r"

  ".W": "There is compelling evidence that childhood is a particularly vulnerable time for the photocarcinogenic effects of sun exposure on the skin. Studies indicate that excessive sun exposure during the first 10-20 years of life greatly increases the risk of skin cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) has been associated with cumulative sun exposure, whereas melanoma has been associated with short, intense sun exposure or blistering sunburn. Under normal circumstances, children receive three times the annual sun exposure of adults; most of one's lifetime sun exposure occurs in childhood. Depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer adds to the photodamage problem. It is clear that sun protection is most vital in the early years. Those with fair skin are at highest risk. Photoprotective measures including sunscreen, clothing, and sun avoidance in childhood may significantly reduce the occurrence of melanoma and other skin cancer in later life. Regular use of sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 15 during the first 18 years of life could reduce the lifetime incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer by 78%. Pediatricians can play a major role in educating parents and children.\r"

General anesthesia and narcotic analgesia are not appropriate. Dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with lidocaine hydrochloride is probably the most effective and safest form of anesthesia for newborn circumcision currently available, but it can cause significant local and systemic reactions. Only a limited number of cases of DPNB have been reported and we feel that this procedure should be used cautiously until there is more published evidence of its safety. Alternative methods of pain relief including oral acetaminophen and topical anesthesia should also be studied. Of special interest is recent evidence that a sucrose-flavored pacifier is an effective analgesic during newborn circumcision.\r"

In contrast, little is known of the outcome of GER diagnosed in normal older children. The charts of 32 children (21 males) without neurologic or esophageal anatomic abnormalities, age 3.5 to 16 years (mean = 9.8) at the time of diagnosis, were reviewed. Diagnosis was based on suggestive presenting symptoms and evaluation of prolonged intraesophageal pH monitoring. Esophagitis was diagnosed by histologic criteria in 16 of the 32 patients. Medical treatment consisted of prokinetic agents (metoclopramide, bethanechol) and H2-receptor antagonists. After a one to eight year follow-up period (mean +/- SD - 3.4 +/- 2.1), the symptoms in 13 children had resolved or were sufficiently improved to discontinue medication. In 13 patients, symptoms were improved but medication was required for adequate control. Four children were symptomatic without improvement in spite of medical therapy and two others required fundoplication for continued severe symptoms and refractory esophagitis. In summary, less than 50% of otherwise normal older children with GER undergo spontaneous resolution of marked improvement in symptoms and the remainder require continued long-term medical and/or surgical management.\r"

The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was chosen as an objective test instrument to confirm the effect of beta-blockade on test anxiety and performance. Thirty-two high school students who had already taken the SAT before enrolling in this study and who had stress-induced cognitive dysfunction on exams were given 40 mg of propranolol one hour before they retook those tests. Mean SAT scores with beta-blockade were 130 points higher than on the initial SAT done before entering the study without medication (p = less than .01). A single dose of propranolol immediately before the SAT permitted improved performance in students prone to cognitive dysfunction due to test anxiety.\r"

The patients ranged in age from two days to 66.5 years with a mean age of 6.42 years; 68% were less than one year of age. The most common diagnoses were hypoplastic left heart syndrome in 16 (32%) and ventricular septal defect in five (10%). Other common diagnoses included coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great vessels and tricuspid atresia. No patient had a missed diagnosis that would have changed survival (Class 1). Four (8%) of the patients had one missed major diagnosis that did not change their survival because they were already being symptomatically treated or because no clinical treatment was available (Class 2). The majority of autopsy derived data were missed minor diagnoses that were related [14 (28%)-Class 3] or unrelated [12 (24%) - Class 4] to the terminal disease process. However, despite the small percentage of autopsy findings that would have directly affected survival, the autopsy provided important additional clinical information in 30 (60%) patients. This information could be used to correct management errors and to develop protocols for prophylaxis against known complications. The pediatric autopsy can provide useful clinical data that may be a guide to altering clinical therapy and is essential in providing genetic counseling.\r"

These glycoproteins are found in nearly all body fluids and in tissue extracellular matrices. Alterations in the normal synthesis, release, and distribution of fibronectins are characteristic features of certain human pathophysiologic conditions. The therapeutic administration of plasma fibronectin to human patients with defects in corneal wound healing and critically ill adult patients with multisystem organ failure appears clinically beneficial, although confirmation is needed from additional trials in progress. In vitro data suggest a role for fibronectin in enhancing (directly and indirectly) the function of phagocytes isolated from the blood of newborn infants. Although as yet untested, it is possible that fibronectin administration to the immunologically immature human neonate may improve host defenses and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection. Additional research is needed to define the factors that regulate the synthesis, isoform expression, and clearance of endogenous fibronectins during normal fetal and neonatal development. Continued research to define the role of endogenous fibronectins in augmenting the inflammatory response of the neonatal host is also required before rational immunotherapeutic interventions can be initiated.\r"

Profound disturbances in myeloid progenitor proliferation, bone marrow neutrophil storage pools, a tendency to peripheral neutropenia and significant in vitro abnormalities of mature neutrophil cell effector function all predispose the neonate to a high mortality rate during bacterial sepsis. The recent use of hematopoietic CSFs and other cytokines to enhance host defense mechanisms in the adult has suggested a role for this new form of immunotherapy in the newborn. Several studies over the past 2 years have indicated that a number of these cytokines may in fact enhance neonatal myeloid progenitor proliferation, modulate neonatal bone marrow neutrophil storage and proliferative pools, induce peripheral neutrophilia and protect against the high mortality rate associated with experimental bacterial sepsis to enhance neonatal host defense against overwhelming bacterial infection.\r"

CT is now the mainstay of diagnosis for stable patients with blunt hepatic injuries. This allows for nonoperative therapy in many patients with lacerations, intrahepatic hematomas, or subcapsular hematomas. Simple operative techniques are used in 60% of patients with blunt injuries, and any deaths in this group are usually due to associated injuries. In patients requiring advanced techniques of repair, postoperative management emphasizes basic techniques including correction of hypothermia and coagulopathies and early use of enteral feeding. Postoperative complications are not rare when Class III, IV, or V hepatic injuries have been treated, but can be managed with the assistance of the interventional radiologist, blood bank, or by use of early reoperation. Mortality depends on mechanism of injury and magnitude of hepatic injury, and ranges from 14-31% for patients with blunt trauma.\r"

  ".W": "In the natural history of this disorder, resumption of normal activity after a period of recuperation (following an episode of thrombosis) frequently leads to symptoms of upper extremity venous hypertension exacerbated by using the arms in the overhead position. This position can be demonstrated venographically to further occlude collateral vessels in thoracic outlet. A number of patients develop more extensive symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. Anticoagulation may protect the collateral vessels and interrupt the period of active clot propagation resulting in a better functional result than would be expected from the natural history of the thrombotic event. In our experience, local Urokinase was the most effective means for reestablishing venous patency. With clot dissolution the underlying compression of the vein at the thoracic outlet can be demonstrated. Balloon angioplasty should not be undertaken in the acute setting nor prior to relieving the tendinous compression. The acute phlebitic process should resolve under the protection of Coumadin for three months. At that time it can be determined more effectively which patients require additional therapy. Removal of the first rib will decompress the axillosubclavian vein and the thoracic outlet collaterals permitting the vein to regain its normal configuration particularly in younger patients with more acute onset of compression. In those patients with more chronic compression the vein becomes stenotic. Improvement of the luminal configuration has been accomplished with transvenous balloon angioplasty without the necessity for venous reconstructive procedures in this series. Patients with Paget-Schroetter syndrome have a symptom complex which often reflects more extensive neurovascular compression at the thoracic outlet than that which might result from venous hypertension alone. Although thrombolytic therapy can restore patency of the axillosubclavian vein, first rib resection is necessary to relieve the external compression. This procedure was very effective in patients who had restoration of subclavian vein patency, and to a lesser degree in those with residual occlusion.\r"

  ".U": "91347641\r", 
  ".W": "The RAS is part of an extremely powerful feedback system for long-term control of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. Disturbances that tend to lower blood pressure, such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and peripheral vasodilation, cause sodium and water retention until blood pressure returns to normal due, in large part, to the combined actions of ANGII and reduced arterial pressure. In response to increased sodium intake, decreased ANGII formation greatly amplifies the effectiveness of pressure natriuresis, thereby preventing large increases in body fluid volumes and blood pressure. In circumstances in which the RAS is inappropriately activated, the sodium retaining effects of ANGII necessitate increased blood pressure to maintain sodium balance via pressure natriuresis. Because the RAS is so powerful in regulating blood pressure, blockade of the system with ACE inhibitors offers a powerful therapeutic tool in diseases such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. The control of sodium excretion and blood pressure by ANGII is exerted through multiple intrarenal as well as extrarenal effects, including stimulation of aldosterone secretion, which can influence renal excretion. Current evidence suggests that the intrarenal effects of ANGII are quantitatively more important than those mediated by aldosterone in controlling blood pressure and renal excretion. The most important intrarenal effects of ANGII include efferent arteriolar constriction as well as direct effects on sodium transport. The constrictor effect on efferent arterioles also is important in preventing reductions in GFR in circumstances associated with impaired renal perfusion. Therefore blockade of ANGII formation in circumstances such as renal artery stenosis may caused marked reductions in GFR. However, in many patients efferent arteriolar vasodilation caused by ANGII blockade may not lower GFR markedly because of other autoregulatory mechanisms that compensate by causing parallel reductions in afferent arteriolar resistance. In these individuals, chronic ACE inhibition may prove to be beneficial in slowing the progression of renal disease because a reduction in glomerular hydrostatic pressure may help to prevent glomerular damage.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes an elderly outreach program (EOP) designed to identify and provide mental health services to the rural elderly. The project integrates a variety of health, mental health, and human service agencies in the planning and delivery of services. Five referral sources are identified and described as well as the assessment, treatment, and referral process. Outcomes are discussed in terms of: characteristics of persons served, ability of the project to identify and deliver mental health services, treatment effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of the project. The EOP seems to have prevented an increase in need for mental health care among Iowans that might have occurred in the program's absence.\r"

  ".W": "This paper presents two strategies for treating depression in Alzheimer's patients. Cognitive therapy, used with mildly demented adults, challenges the patient's negative cognitions in order to reduce distortions and enable the patient to generate more adaptive ways of viewing specific situations and events. Behavioral intervention, used with more moderately or severely demented adults, attempts to modify person-environment interactions by increasing the level of positive activities and decreasing negative ones (Lewinsohn et al., 1984). Both theories have been used successfully in clinical settings.\r"

  ".W": "The rational evaluation of hair disorders requires familiarity with follicular anatomy. Hair structure can be easily examined by studying clipped hair shafts, entire hairs gently pulled or forcibly plucked from the scalp, and scalp biopsies (sectioned vertically or transversely). Anatomic features will be different depending on whether a given hair is in the anagen, catagen, or telogen phase. Follicle size will also vary, from the minute vellus hair to the long, thick terminal hair. Each follicle can be divided into distinct regions--bulb, suprabulbar zone, isthmus, and infundibulum. Activity growing (anagen) hairs are characterized by a hair matrix surrounding a dermal papilla; inner and outer root sheaths are present and well developed. A catagen hair can be identified by its markedly thickened vitreous layer and fibrous root sheath, which surrounds an epithelial column; above this column, the presumptive club forms. A telogen hair is distinguished by its fully keratinized club, which is surrounded by an epithelial sac. Below this lies the secondary hair germ and condensed dermal papilla, waiting for the mysterious signal that initiates a new life cycle.\r"
