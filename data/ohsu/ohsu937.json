  ".W": "It is generally recognized that cat skin is an important extrasalivary source of the major cat allergen, Fel d I. Nevertheless, since cat saliva is readily applied to the skin during grooming, we tried to demonstrate that Fel d I can accumulate on cat skin without licking. Eight adult female cats were used. On day 0, two separate sites of the trunk were shaved and a 6 cm2 area in each site was washed three times with 5 ml of distilled water. The first and third washes were collected and stored for assay. The areas were then covered with an occlusive dressing. Twenty-four hours later, the site was washed once and the sample stored. On day 7, washes were collected as on day 0, and a collar was attached to the neck to prevent contamination from saliva. A single wash was done 24 hours later. Comparison of data was achieved with an analysis of variance. Repeated washes significantly reduced Fel d I levels from 35 +/- 21 to 10 +/- 9 mU/cm2 on day 0 (p less than 0.01) and from 36 +/- 18 to 12 +/- 7 mU/cm2 on day 7 (p less than 0.01). Fel d I levels increased significantly after 24 hours of occlusion from 10 +/- 9 to 41 +/- 24 mU/cm2 (p less than 0.01) and collar wearing from 12 +/- 7 to 54 +/- 21 mU/cm2 (p less than 0.001). These findings demonstrate that Fel d I is produced by cat skin. Mean daily production of Fel d I by cat skin is estimated to be 36 units. Cat skin is an important extrasalivary source of Fel d I.\r"

  ".W": "Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy (AHEI) is an acute cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) of infants. The clinical picture has a violent onset with a short benign course followed by spontaneous complete recovery. We report 12 infants with AHEI who were studied clinically, serologically, and immunohistologically. Edema and palpable purpuric skin lesions were present in all infants who were in good general condition. Serologic studies were unremarkable. Light microscopic examination of the skin biopsy specimens revealed LCV as in Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Direct immunofluorescent study revealed depositions of various immunoreactants, including fibrinogen, C3, IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE (100%, 100%, 22%, 78%, 33%, and 33%, respectively) in the wall and around the small vessels. Similar deposition of Clq was also present in three infants in whom Clq could be studied (100%). The clinical similarities and differences between AHEI and HSP have been discussed in the literature. AHEI is observed before 2 years of age and is confined to the skin. The skin lesions of HSP are more polymorphic. Although histopathologic findings are similar, the immunohistologic pattern found in our series of AHEI is rather different from the pattern of HSP. Taking all of these findings into account, we suggest that AHEI should be considered as a separate, clinicopathologic entity or a possible variant of HSP. The more descriptive term \"acute benign cutaneous LCV of infancy\" is offered for this clinicopathologic entity.\r"

  ".W": "The role of nasal allergy in chronic maxillary sinusitis without an air-fluid level was studied in 37 patients. Seventy-three nasal provocation tests with various inhalant allergens were performed in 37 patients by means of rhinomanometry, and maxillary sinus radiographs were performed before and repeatedly after the allergen challenge. Forty-one positive nasal responses (NRs) occurred in 29 patients; 13 were immediate only, 18 were late only, and 10 NRs were dual responses. Of these responses, 32 demonstrated radiographic changes, primarily an increase in mucosal edema and/or opacification. These responses were accompanied by increased pressure in the maxillary sinuses, acute headache, and sometimes otalgia. Eight patients did not develop any NRs; however, increased thickening of the mucosal membrane of the maxillary sinuses, accompanied by subjective symptoms, was recorded in three of these nonresponders. These results demonstrate the role of nasal allergy in some patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis, which may affect the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a histamine H3-receptor antagonist on the bronchoconstrictor response to antigen challenge were studied in sensitized guinea pigs. We monitored airway opening pressure as an index of airway caliber, and the provocative dose of intravenous ovalbumin (OA) required to produce 200% increase in airway opening pressure (PD200) was determined. Animals were pretreated with propranolol to inhibit adrenergic bronchodilation. OA (1 to 100 micrograms/kg intravenously) challenge caused significant bronchoconstriction with a PD200 of 28.8 micrograms/kg (geometric mean). The selective H3-antagonist, thioperamide (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally), significantly enhanced the OA-induced bronchoconstriction with the PD200 value decreased to 4.0 micrograms/kg (p less than 0.001). The H2-antagonist, cimetidine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally), had no significant effect on OA-induced response (PD200, 18.2 micrograms/kg). The H1-antagonist, mepyramine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally), almost completely blocked the effect of OA, suggesting that OA-induced bronchoconstrictor responses are histamine (H1 receptor) mediated. Thioperamide did not alter the dose-response curve to exogenous histamine (0.3 to 3 micrograms/kg intravenously). We conclude that H3 receptors might play a role in regulation of antigen-induced response in the airways.\r"

The results demonstrated that immune complexes (ICs) at equivalence were more efficient than antibodies in promoting a suppression of this response when they were injected simultaneously or before, but not after, the antigen. This effect was dose dependent, antigen specific, and long lasting. Furthermore, only isologous ICs were suppressive. ICs prepared with IgG1 antibodies were more effective than ICs prepared with IgG2. Digestion of the Fc fragment of the antibody eliminated completely the suppressive action of antibodies alone, but not of ICs. These results indicate that, whereas an Fc-dependent mechanism is responsible for the effect of antibodies, an additional mechanism is also operating in suppression induced by ICs.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-five patients with classic food-allergic symptoms and/or subjective food-related complaints not traditionally associated with food allergy underwent evaluation. On the basis of a comprehensive clinical history, skin testing, and placebo-controlled, double-blind food challenges, patients were assigned to one of two groups: patients with reactions highly suggestive of IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity (group A, N = 22) and patients with atypical adverse food reactions that could not be confirmed by double-blind food challenge (group B, N = 23). Most patients in both groups were female, 77.3% and 91.3% of patients in group A and B, respectively. In group B, onset of symptoms occurred at an older age than in group A, 28.9 years +/- 17.2 versus 17.1 +/- 12.1 (p = 0.0015), respectively, and involved more foods, 25.6 +/- 22.1 versus 5.2 +/- 5.5 (p = 0.0002). Foods causing most prominent symptoms among patients in group A included legumes, tree nuts, crustaceans, and fish. In group B, milk, white sugar, wheat, egg, smoked/cured meat, and yeast were among the most troublesome foods. All but one patient in group A gave a positive skin test response to food; only four patients in group B had a positive response. We conclude that a subset of patients with food-related complaints can be accurately predicted to have a negative double-blind challenge with suspected foods on the basis of information obtained by history and skin testing.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6/B cell stimulatory factor 2) has been found to drive activated human B-lymphocytes through the final stages of differentiation to become immunoglobulin-producing cells. Most patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) have B-lymphocytes that fail to differentiate into high-rate immunoglobulin-secreting cells in vivo and in vitro. In view of (1) the known effects of IL-6 to promote B-lymphocyte terminal differentiation and (2) the defect in differentiation in B-lymphocytes of patients with CVI, we believed that it was important to analyze the role of this cytokine in patients with CVI. Using an IL-6-dependent murine hybridoma cell line in a bioassay, serum IL-6 levels were determined in 17 patients with CVI and in eight normal control subjects. Thirteen of the 17 patients with CVI exhibited serum IL-6 levels that were twofold to 18-fold higher than the range (mean, +2 SD) of normal control subjects. Spontaneous IL-6 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with CVI was significantly higher than that from normal control subjects, whereas lipopolysaccharide maximally stimulated IL-6 production by PBMCs of patients with CVI or PBMCs of normal control subjects was equivalent. A substance inhibitory of IL-6 bioactivity was found in equivalent amounts in sera of both patients and normal control subjects. Sera from patients with CVI with high IL-6 bioactivity were found to have saturated this IL-6 inhibitory substance, thus resulting in large amounts of free IL-6 in the sera. These studies suggest that the failure of B cells from patients with CVI to terminally differentiate into high-rate immunoglobulin-secreting cells cannot be attributed to a decrease in the serum levels of IL-6 and that the increased circulating IL-6 levels in patients with CVI result from hyperproduction rather than decreased use of IL-6. The persistently elevated levels of IL-6 observed in some patients with CVI may secondarily result in the induction of the neoplastic and autoimmune phenomena associated with this disease.\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of immunotherapy was conducted in patients with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus rhinitis.

Specific IgG and subclasses were measured before and after 3 and 12 months of treatment by RIA and/or ELISA, and specific IgE by RAST. Clinical outcome was assessed by skin prick tests, nasal challenge, visual analogue, and diary-card symptom and drug scores; from these findings, a clinical index was derived. An IgG response occurred only in the Pharmalgen-treated group: D. pter IgG and IgG1 increased by 3 months (p less than 0.05) and then plateaued to 12 months (p less than 0.05). IgG4 levels increased throughout treatment (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01), as did the IgG/IgE ratio. A subclass switch from IgG1 to IgG4 occurred. D. pter IgE rose at 3 months (p less than 0.05). Clinical improvement occurred at 3 and 12 months in the Pharmalgen-treated group only. Pretreatment levels of IgE, IgG1, or IgG4 did not predict clinical outcome. Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that IgG subclasses may modulate antigen-IgE interactions, although the antibody response to this potent extract need not be causally related to improvement.\r"

The results revealed a heterogenous antibody response, unique for each patient, to specific Aspergillus fumigatus antigens that correlated with the molecular weights of previously well-characterized antigens of importance in the immunopathogenesis of ABPA. A rating scale was devised for measuring band intensity that allowed the patient's antibody responses to be reproducibly semiquantitated. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated qualitative and semiquantitative information that is not available with other in vitro assays used in the study of patients with ABPA, such as ELISA. These initial results emphasize the need for additional evaluation of this technique to assess its potential clinical application in this disease.\r"

Moreover, basophils of some aspirin-sensitive subjects with asthma released histamine by PAF stimulation in the absence of cytochalasin B that affects histamine release and is required in PAF-induced histamine release from leukocytes of atopic subjects with asthma and normal control subjects. In addition to temperature dependency and inhibition by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid reported previously, PAF-induced histamine release was enhanced by cytochalasin B and indomethacin and inhibited by dexamethasone. These features are common with IgE-mediated histamine release and suggest the existence of the common pathway to PAF-induced histamine release and IgE-mediated histamine release. The results in the present study indicate the pathophysiologic significance of PAF-induced histamine release and that activation of basophils by PAF may be relevant to the pathogenesis in some aspirin-sensitive subjects with asthma.\r"

Thirty-seven subjects (23%) had a history suggestive of occupational asthma and 59 (36%), of occupational rhinitis. Eight subjects (5%) demonstrated immediate skin reactivity to guar gum. Eleven subjects (8.3%) had serum IgE antibodies to guar gum. All subjects, except one subject who had a history suggestive of occupational asthma (n = 37) or positive skin tests (n = 4), participated in the second part of the study. A methacholine-inhalation test was performed during a workshift or in the 3 to 4 hours after the workshift. Five subjects had a concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 of less than 16 mg/ml (significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness) and positive skin reactions to guar gum. Four of these subjects underwent specific inhalation challenges. The remaining subject had a history of severe bronchospastic reaction on exposure to guar gum, and his FEV1 of 1.6 L made specific challenges impossible.

All these patients had normal pulmonary function, were administered carbachol or methacholine bronchial challenges, and had one or more skin reactions to perennial or seasonal allergens. Patients were allocated to three groups: group A, patients with seasonal rhinitis who were administered nonspecific challenges out of season; group B, patients with seasonal rhinitis tested during the season; and group C, patients with perennial rhinitis. The three groups were divided into subgroups according to the duration in years of rhinitis and to the degree of nonspecific bronchial responsiveness. The distribution into four groups of reactivity, arbitrarily defined as normal and mildly, moderately, and severely increased reactivity, was as follows: group A, 124, 21, 30, 22; group B, 75, 15, 7, and 21: and group C, 69, 17, 39, and 72, respectively. The patients of group C (perennial rhinitis) demonstrated a distribution significantly (p less than 0.001) different from subjects with seasonal rhinitis, both group A and group B. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that perennial rhinitis is much more important than seasonal rhinitis as a risk factor for developing nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\r"

Although they are found in all human tissue, mast cells are most prevalent at the interface between the host and its environment, that is, in the skin and in the mucosa of the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the gastrointestinal tract. Recent evidence suggests that two types of mast cells exist: (1) the connective tissue type, found primarily but not exclusively in loose connective tissue and skin, and (2) the mucosal type, found primarily in gastrointestinal mucosa and peripheral airways. The factors that produce this differentiation are not fully known. Although both mast cell types have IgE receptors that can be activated by allergens, differences between the two types exist in their responses to nonallergic signals, the mediators they release, their proteoglycan constituents, and the makeup of their granular enzymes. The importance of these biochemical differences to cellular functioning remains to be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Tryptase, a mediator secreted by human mast cells during immediate reactions, has demonstrated effects on several pathways in vitro. This enzyme can rapidly inactivate fibrinogen and, as a complex with heparin, may prevent coagulation that may otherwise occur when plasma enters tissues at sites of immediate reactions. Tryptase may also activate prostromelysin, which in turn activates latent collagenase. When canine pulmonary smooth muscle is incubated with canine tryptase, the contractile response to histamine is increased. Tryptase, quantifiable in complex biologic fluids by immunoassay, can serve as a specific indicator of mast cell involvement in certain clinical settings. For example, after bee sting--induced anaphylaxis, tryptase levels in the blood peak at approximately 1 hour, then decline with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Additionally, elevated tryptase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asymptomatic, atopic persons with asthma suggest ongoing mast cell activation, which may relate to adenosine hyperresponsiveness and a persistence of bronchial hyperreactivity. Tryptase levels in bronchial lavage fluid of atopic patients with asthma rise markedly after endobronchial allergen challenge but not after an exercise challenge, suggesting a lack of mast cell involvement in the latter condition.\r"

  ".W": "Histamine, which is stored mainly in mast cells and basophils, is a prominent contributor to allergic disease. Elevations in plasma or tissue histamine levels have been noted during anaphylaxis and experimental allergic responses of the skin, nose, and airways. Of the four cardinal signs of asthma (bronchospasm, edema, inflammation, and mucus secretion), histamine is capable of mediating the first two through its H1 receptor and mucus secretion through its H2 receptor. Of the five cardinal signs of allergic rhinitis (pruritus, mucosal edema, sneezing, mucus secretion, and late-phase inflammatory reactions), histamine is capable of mediating the first three through its H1 receptor. In the nose, mucus secretion can be reflexively mediated by H1 and possibly also by H2 receptors. In the skin the cardinal features of urticaria (vasodilation, vascular permeability, and pruritus) can be mediated by stimulation of the H1 receptor. In anaphylaxis histamine H1-receptor stimulation can mediate vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and tachycardia, whereas H2-receptor stimulation can mediate mucus secretion. Stimulation of both receptors can mediate vasodilation and reduce peripheral vascular resistance. Thus although histamine is only one of many mediators of allergic disease, it plays a primary role in allergic rhinitis, urticaria, anaphylaxis, and to a lesser degree, asthma.\r"

Classic first-generation antihistamines, which are available without prescription, can cross the blood-brain barrier and have been reported to produce various central nervous system effects. Sedation, the most common adverse effect of these agents, occurs in 10% to 25% of antihistamine users. Drowsiness has been attributed to the blockade of central histaminergic receptors; antagonism of other brain receptors, such as serotonergic, cholinergic, and central alpha-adrenergic receptors, has also been proposed. The newer second-generation H1-receptor antagonists are typically large, lipophobic molecules with a charged side chain and are extensively bound to albumin. Consequently, these agents have difficulty entering the brain, and they appear no more likely to induce sedation than does placebo. The effects of antihistamines on psychomotor reflexes and driving, antihistamine-induced drowsiness, and interaction of antihistamines with alcohol and tranquilizers have been studied with numerous methodologies. The centrally acting first-generation agents commonly cause greater performance decrements as compared with the newer, nonsedating, second-generation antihistamines.\r"

  ".W": "Recent research has disclosed that neurotransmitters and neuropeptides released within the autonomic nervous system exert homeostatic control of nasal secretion. Although cholinergic and adrenergic influences have long been thought to be the predominant mechanisms, the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic responses may have more suitable, longer-lasting effects. Peptides from sensory nerves, such as calcitonin gene related peptide, substance P, and neurokinin A, may participate in axon response-mediated vasodilation and plasma extravasation. Substance P and gastrin releasing peptide may induce glandular secretion. Defensive responses to local mucosal injury may be amplified by axon response, which initiates these vascular and glandular reactions. Cholinergic effects are primarily responsible for mediating parasympathetic reflexes, but vasoactive intestinal peptide may regulate acetylcholine release, augment glandular secretory responses, and have a vasodilatory effect. In the sympathetic nervous system, neuropeptide Y probably functions as a long-acting vasoconstrictor. Integration of sympathetic and parasympathetic influence may regulate the normal nasal cycle, and sensory and parasympathetic defensive reflexes may respond to epithelial and mast cell stimulation. It is possible, then, that the pathophysiology of vasomotor rhinitis involves an exaggeration of these neural influences.\r"

The response to antigen challenge is often biphasic. During the early response, increases in histamine levels appear to be associated with activation of mast cells. In a subset of persons who exhibit an additional late response, however, the rise in histamine is concomitant with an increase in the number of basophils. Further evidence of the role of histamine in allergic rhinitis has emerged from nasal provocation experiments involving pretreatment with a variety of drugs known to antagonize or affect release of histamine. Nasal provocation with histamine causes sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Most H1 antihistamines have been found to inhibit sneezing and to lessen the increase in vascular permeability, but they do not affect histamine release. The H1 antihistamine terfenadine, however, inhibits histamine release during the early response; effects on late response remain unknown. Prednisone decreases histamine levels during the late, but not the early, response. One-week pretreatment with topical steroids, on the other hand, affects both the early and the late response.\r"

ETO can be demonstrated during both early- and late-phase reactions in patients with allergic rhinitis after intranasal challenge with an allergen. Intranasal challenge with either histamine or prostaglandin D2 also provokes ETO, with the latter mediator perhaps more potent than the former. Middle ear effusions from patients with chronic or recurrent otitis media have been found to contain dramatically increased concentrations of histamine relative to the concentrations in their plasma. The development of nasal and eustachian tube obstruction in allergic rhinitis patients has been prevented by pretreatment with an antihistamine plus decongestant before intranasal challenge with pollen allergen. Investigations are currently under way to assess the effect of antihistamine pretreatment on nasal and eustachian tube obstruction in patients undergoing intranasal histamine challenge.\r"

In comparative trials between the various nonsedating agents, no significant difference in efficacy has been noted. All these agents have good safety profiles, although astemizole use has been correlated with increased appetite and weight gain in some patients, and cetirizine has caused slightly increased sedative effects compared with placebo.

Histologic features typically include edema within the epidermis and dermis and a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with an admixture of basophils. Langerhans cells and keratinocytes play pivotal roles in allergic contact dermatitis reactions. Langerhans cells synthesize and express class II molecules that allow the presentation of exogenous antigens to T lymphocytes. Additionally, keratinocytes and Langerhans cells produce interleukin-1, which is thought to be a second signal that activates T cells. Mast cells and basophils also may play a proinflammatory role. Treatment primarily consists of removal of the offending agent. At times, systemic corticosteroids may be required, especially in the acute phase. In more chronic cases, topical corticosteroids may be beneficial. Antihistamines may be useful because of their soporific effects, but their usefulness is limited.\r"

This activation results in the release of mediators that are capable of amplifying the inflammatory process within the joint space. Recent research has shown that mast cells also produce a variety of cytokines and hematopoietic growth factors that may have paracrine and autocrine functions that are important to the development of the inflammatory cell infiltrate. Increased numbers of mast cells are also found in many fibrotic conditions, including scleroderma. These mast cells, directly or through mediator generation, affect the function of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and growth factors important to the proliferation and function of these cells. A clearer understanding of mast cell involvement in the inflammatory arthritides and fibrotic processes should lead to new therapeutic strategies.\r"

H1 receptors mediate coronary artery vasoconstriction, wheezing, cutaneous vascular permeability, and possibly an increase in pulse rate. H2 receptors stimulate ventricular and atrial inotropy, arterial chronotropy, coronary vasodilation, and rises in basophil cyclic adenosine 3':5' monophosphate (cyclic AMP). (Neither receptor mediates increases in cyclic AMP in mast cells.) H1 and H2 receptors in combination seem to be most potent in mediating flush, headache, increases in pulse pressure, and decreases in diastolic blood pressure. Clinical trials have been conducted to determine the efficacy of H1 and H2 antagonists in preventing anaphylactic reactions to plasma expanders, anesthesia-inducing agents, morphine, and radiocontrast material. Concurrently, retrospective observations of the prevention of anaphylactic reactions to chymopapain have been recorded. Despite some conflicting and inconclusive data, the sum of these studies indicates that pretreatment with a combination of H1 and H2 antagonists is more effective than H1 antagonists alone in preventing reactions to these agents. These results, when added to the available knowledge of the physiology of histamine release, support the preferential use of H1/H2 antagonist combinations in the prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions.\r"

Air sampling should always be a last resort and should use a reliable volumetric method. Particulate samplers, such as the Burkard personal spore trap, are inexpensive alternatives to viable particle samplers and will provide data on most organisms implicated in hypersensitivity diseases. Interpretation of residential bioaerosol sample data requires both qualitative and quantitative comparison with adjacent outdoor air and examination of aerosol changes related to domestic activities. Recommendations that should lead to a decrease in indoor bioaerosols include the use of air conditioning to allow limitation of outdoor aerosols, prevention of dampness or moisture intrusion, and discouraging the use of humidifying devices other than steam. Bioaerosol assessment in the workplace is often more complex than for residences. Because the symptomatic subjects are not in charge of the environment, such situations often lead to difficult employee/management relations and occasionally to litigation. It is essential that each step in workplace bioaerosol assessment be defensible and that the best possible methods are used. The approach is similar to the approach used for residences, but on a larger scale. Symptom assessment must include stress and ergonomic factors. Air sampling, if this is necessary, must usually be extensive with controls for ventilation rates, occupancy, and spatial variation.\r"

Bronchial hyperreactivity (assessed by methacholine-challenge tests) in the patients with asthma was uncorrelated with the ED50 or Emax of isoproterenol. These results demonstrate no evidence for a generalized change in alpha- or beta-adrenergic responsiveness on smooth muscle cells in asthma. Hand-vein responsiveness to isoproterenol was unchanged after treatment for 7 days with oral terbutaline (5 mg three times per day). Thus, unlike leukocytes, smooth muscle appears not readily susceptible to beta-adrenoceptor desensitization in vivo. Local infusions of prednisolone or dexamethasone during 2 hours and systemic administration of dexamethasone (24 hours) caused a significant fall in the Emax for isoproterenol. The mechanism of attenuation of beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness by corticosteroids remains to be determined.\r"

Airway damage is a feature of this disorder, and although Aspergillus-derived proteinases have been described, the capacity of Aspergillus, however, to directly induce damage to human epithelium has not previously been studied. We therefore cultured Aspergillus fumigatus from two patients with ABPA, extracted mycelial products by sonication and filtration, and then evaluated their capacity to induce epithelial cell (EC) desquamation from basement membrane using an in vitro model that uses intact human amniotic EC and native basement membrane. A. fumigatus extracts induced detachment of EC in a dose-dependent fashion, producing up to 34% +/- 6% detachment (p less than 0.05 compared to medium alone). Enzyme analysis of A. Fumigatus extract using synthetic substrates revealed the presence of a number of different enzymes; therefore, studies with specific proteinase inhibitors were undertaken to identify the proteinase(s) responsible for detachment. A. Fumigatus-induced desquamation was partially inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and substantially inhibited by glutathione and N-acetylcysteine, but not by alpha 1-antitrypsin, 1,10 phenanthroline, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, aprotinin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor at concentrations that inhibit other serine- or metalloproteinases. Gel filtration of the extract with a Sepharose 6B column revealed that the major epithelium-detaching activity appeared in the 20 to 35 kd fraction. Comparison with proteinase standards suggested a role for a chymotrypsin-like proteinase. Thus, A. fumigatus releases a proteinase that is directly able to induce EC detachment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A histamine bronchial-challenge test revealed bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 95% of the children who had a history of wheezing or asthma and who could perform the test reliably, indicating that most of them did indeed have asthma. Children with a history of AD were much more likely to have asthma if the mother was a smoker than if she was a nonsmoker (79% versus 52%; p = 0.001). Similarly, if AD was found on examination, the percentages with asthma were 74% and 44%, respectively. By contrast, the children with no history of AD had asthma as frequently if the mother was a nonsmoker (42%) as when she was a smoker (40%). In children with AD, the prevalence of asthma was greater in both boys and girls when the mother was a smoker, but only in boys when the father was a smoker. Multiple logistic regression confirmed that the risk of asthma was greatly increased when the child had both AD and a mother who smoked.\r"

To determine whether PAF or LTB4, could be the stimulus for in vivo Lf release, blood neutrophils of 17 subjects were incubated with PAF, LTB4, or the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and the released Lf (ELISA assay) was compared with spontaneous release. Significantly increased Lf release was induced by PAF, 10(-5) to 10(-8) mol/L (p less than 0.002); LTB4, 10(-7) to 10(-8) mol/L (p less than 0.004); and PMA (0.05 micrograms/ml) in a dose-dependent reaction. Cytochalasin was not required for Lf secretion but did enhance such responses. PAF-induced Lf secretion was inhibited by the specific PAF antagonist, BN 52063. More Lf was released from neutrophils of atopic than from nonatopic subjects in response to PAF, 10(-6) mol/L (4.2 micrograms/ml +/- 0.2 versus 2.6 micrograms/ml +/- 0.2; p less than 0.001) but not to LTB4, PMA, or buffer (p, not significant). We conclude that (1) PAF and LTB4 released in vivo could stimulate local neutrophils to release Lf with possible pathogenic effects and (2) neutrophils of atopic subjects are more responsive to PAF than neutrophils of nonatopic subjects in this regard.\r"

In these two patients, repeat confirmatory challenges with 2 gm of salsalate reproduced the same asthmatic reactions. Both patients were desensitized to ASA, and cross-desensitization with 2 gm of salsalate was then achieved. We conclude that salsalate, a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase in vitro, is less likely than ASA to induce asthma in known ASA-sensitive patients with asthma but may occasionally cross-react in these patients. Such reactions were mild and easily treated with beta 2-agonists.\r"

The effects of intradermal injections (50 microliters) of six different concentrations of histamine (range, 3.3 x 10(-4) to 3.3 x 10(-9) mol/L) and the leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 (range, 2 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-9) mol/L) have been compared in 10 normal subjects and in 10 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Wheal-and-flare sizes were measured at timed intervals up to 4 hours, and area under the curve for each response over time was calculated. There were no significant differences in leukotriene-induced responses between groups. Maximum sizes of histamine-induced wheal and flare were similar in each group of subjects. There were, however, significant increases in mean areas under the response curve of histamine wheal and flare in the patients with urticaria (wheal, p less than 0.001; flare, p less than 0.001; analysis of variance). These findings demonstrate a prolongation of skin responses to histamine in patients with urticaria and suggest an impaired clearance of histamine (or other vasoactive agents released by histamine) from the skin of these patients.\r"

Thirteen extracts (10 pollens, two house dust (HD) mites and cat) were tested in three groups of subjects, 50 with a history of asthma or allergic rhinitis (AL), 50 without asthma or perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis but with a positive immediate family history for these conditions (FAL), and 100 subjects without a personal or family history for these conditions (NAL). An SPT mean wheal diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm was considered positive. Ninety percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 82% to 98%) of AL subjects had at least one positive SPT. Forty-six percent of FAL subjects (95% CI, 30% to 58%) and 29% of NAL subjects (95% CI, 20% to 38%) had at least one positive SPT. More FAL than NAL subjects had at least one SPT (p less than 0.05), and FAL subjects had more positive SPTs than NAL subjects (p less than 0.05), further supporting the genetic regulation of allergen-specific IgE production. Of the five AL subjects with no SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm, three subjects were available for intradermal tests. Thirteen nonstandardized allergens similar to allergens used for SPT were applied intradermally in each of these three subjects and were all negative. Compared with history, an SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm to cat produced a sensitivity of 0.90, a specificity of 0.90, and diagnostic accuracy of 0.90. Tenfold dilutions of pollens and cat reduced sensitivity without significantly improving specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ninety-two percent of the treated subjects achieved maintenance, and 84% continued therapy, most subjects (91%) until the study was terminated. One hundred seventy-one subjects (12%) experienced 327 treatment systemic reactions (Srs). The incidence of pruritus and angioedema/urticaria was similar with mild, moderate, or severe SRs. The SR severity did not correlate with the severity of the most recent sting before entry into the Hymenoptera-venom study, the most severe historical sting SR, the most severe SR during venom skin tests, the total dose of venom, the degree of skin test reactivity, or the lowest concentration yielding a positive skin test. Most SRs occurred between 1 and 50 micrograms and at maintenance; honeybee or wasp venoms were most likely to produce SR. This study, the largest of its kind with the use of standardized extracts, demonstrates (1) that there was good compliance, (2) that various historical and diagnostic criteria did not predict SRs to VIT, (3) that SRs to VIT were most likely to occur between 1 and 50 micrograms and at maintenance, (4) that honeybee or wasp venoms were most likely to produce an SR, and (5) that VIT is relatively safe.\r"

In addition, allergens from AWBE and GWBE fractions 2 were additionally fractionated by chromatofocusing on polybuffer exchanger. Immunoprinting studies demonstrated several important acidic allergens in cockroach whole body extracts. All but one allergen had an acid isoelectric point (pH 2.80 to 5.20). Two allergens, one that focused at pH 3.50 and another allergen (or group of isoallergens) that focused between pH 4.15 to 4.55 were reactive with most sera obtained from cockroach-sensitive subjects. Chromatofocusing and subsequent skin test and RAST studies of AWBE and GWBE confirmed the presence of significant cockroach allergens with isoelectric points within the zone of pH 3.75 to 4.50. RAST-inhibition studies demonstrated the similarity of these allergens between AWBE and GWBE. Collectively, these observations identify the presence of several acidic cockroach allergens presumably shared between AWBE and GWBE.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, it was suggested that long-term administration of an inhaled beta 2-agonist might increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to histamine, possibly as a consequence of subsensitization to the inhaled beta 2-agonist. To test this hypothesis, we studied two groups of patients with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An experimental group of 15 patients, inhaling 400 micrograms of salbutamol four times daily during 1 year and subsequently 40 micrograms of ipratropium bromide four times daily for 6 months, and a control group, consisting of 22 patients with the opposite treatment regimen. The BHR, the response in FEV1 to cumulative doses of salbutamol, and the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors and antagonist affinity of these receptors on circulating lymphocytes were assessed at the start of the study and at 6-month intervals for 1 1/2 years. The BHR increased significantly (p = 0.001) during the year salbutamol was inhaled and returned to about the value at the start of the study after inhaling ipratropium bromide for 6 months. No change occurred in the bronchodilating responses to cumulative doses of salbutamol, nor was any change observed in the number and the affinity of beta 2-adrenoceptors on lymphocytes. It was concluded that long-term use of salbutamol caused a small but significant increase in BHR. The increase in BHR was not caused by subsensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptors to salbutamol.\r"

Zaprinast, an inhibitor of a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific PDE (PDE I), at concentrations up to 100 mumol/L, had no significant effect on the respiratory burst. Milrinone and imazodan, inhibitors of cAMP-metabolizing, cGMP-sensitive PDE (PDE III), reduced the respiratory burst to 60% of control magnitude but only had significant effects when they were introduced at high (100 mumol/L) concentrations. In contrast, rolipram and RO 20-1724, inhibitors of a cAMP-metabolizing, cGMP-insensitive PDE (PDE IV), had significant effects at low concentrations (0.1 mumol/L) and caused marked reduction of the respiratory burst at higher concentrations (25% of control at 10 mumol/L). The selective PDE IV inhibitors significantly potentiated PMN inhibition by isoproterenol. Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose chromatography demonstrated a predominant PDE isozyme with high affinity and selectivity for cAMP that was insensitive to cGMP and was completely inhibited by rolipram, a PDE IV inhibitor. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the PMN respiratory burst is inhibited by an elevation of cAMP induced by PDE IV inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "The determination of histamine in nasal secretions and nasal lavage fluid may be of importance to monitor activation of histamine containing cells in the nasal cavity. However, such studies have been besieged by controversy, specifically to findings of changes in histamine levels in relation to allergenic stimulation. This controversy may be due to the specificity and accuracy of the various methods used to determine histamine in the nasal fluid. We have therefore applied and compared three new methods to determine histamine in nasal lavage fluids obtained before and after allergen challenge in normal subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis. We used a fluorometric glass fiber-based histamine method (FHR) and two RIAs, I and II. The FHR (detection limit, 7.0 nmol) and the RIA II (detection limit, 0.2 nmol) are specific for histamine itself, whereas the RIA I (detection limit, 18.0 nmol) measures mainly methylhistamine and cross-reacts to some extent with histamine. The histamine levels in the nasal lavage fluids from the nasal challenges demonstrated histamine values between 100 and 2000 nmol/L of histamine with significantly higher levels in the postallergen challenges for the allergic subjects as compared to the normal control subjects. The FHR correlated well with the RIA I and RIA II methods with correlation coefficients of 0.77 to 0.88 (p less than 0.001), respectively. However, the RIA I (methylhistamine antibody) always demonstrated absolute histamine values 5% to 20% of values measured by the RIA II (at the level of cross-reactivity to histamine).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In sarcoidosis, the availability of sol-IL-2R per T cell was significantly higher for the group with inactive sarcoidosis compared with the group with active sarcoidosis.

Questionnaires were mailed to the director of food and nutrition services and the vice president of hospital operations at 132 hospitals in five midwestern states. Fifty-six questionnaires were mailed to all educators on the 1986 to 1988 membership list of the Foodservice Systems Management Education Council. Response rates of directors, administrators, and educators were 68%, 53%, and 82%, respectively. The questionnaire consisted of three parts. Part one addressed credentials required; part two required participants to rank 14 skill categories in order of importance; and part three focused on facility descriptors and credentials of participating administrators and directors. Findings of the survey indicate that the minimum qualifications for department directors were registered dietitian status, at least a bachelor's degree in food and nutrition, and work experience in foodservice systems management. Although administrators ranked foodservice management skills higher than nutrition skills, they ranked nutrition skills significantly (p less than .001) higher than did directors or educators. These findings may guide career development of practitioners who aspire to department director positions.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effect of using two different methods for categorizing food mixtures when calculating the contribution of various food groups to energy, macronutrient, cholesterol, and fiber intakes. Using method 1, each food mixture was classified as a single item and assigned to a food group according to its main ingredient. Using method 2, most of the food mixtures were separated into their constituent ingredients, and each ingredient was assigned to its appropriate food group. Data were from 1,032 women who provided at least 4 days of dietary data in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1985 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals. We found that the importance of each food group's contribution to individual dietary components varied depending on the method used to categorize the food mixtures. When food mixtures were separated into their constituent ingredients before assigning foods to food groups, the contributions of meat, fish, poultry, and grain products declined for each of the seven dietary components studied. At the same time, the contributions of milk products, fats, and oils increased for most of the seven components. The results highlight the importance of foods eaten as part of food mixtures to the intake of energy, macronutrients, cholesterol, and fiber.\r"

The infants ingested either cow's milk or whey-predominant milk-based infant formula as their primary beverage as part of a mixed diet for at least 3 months. The calculated mean +/- standard deviation (SD) daily dietary selenium intake of 26 infants fed cow's milk (34 +/- 13 micrograms), assessed by a 3-day diet record and/or a 24-hour diet recall, was significantly (p less than or equal to .001) greater than that of 31 formula-fed infants (22 +/- 11 micrograms). The mean +/- SD plasma selenium concentration of infants fed cow's milk (39 +/- 11 micrograms/L) was also significantly (p less than or equal to .05) greater than that of infants fed formula (31 +/- 12 micrograms/L). Both groups of infants ingested similar amounts of total energy; however, the infants fed cow's milk received more total protein and selenium and a greater percentage of protein and selenium from their primary beverage than did the infants receiving formula. Both groups of infants were consuming a mixed diet with similar sources of selenium. To examine the selenium status of infants as well as other individuals better, further analysis of foods is clearly needed to provide more information on dietary selenium sources. The influence of variables such as body size and ethnicity, intake, sources and forms of dietary protein, and dietary forms of selenium on plasma selenium concentrations must also be investigated.\r"

In phase one, folate status was evaluated in a biracial sample of 164 adolescents 12 to 15 years old. Socioeconomic, demographic, anthropometric, and 7-day food record data were collected, and serum and erythrocyte folate levels were determined. Thirty-five adolescents considered to have had low folate status 6 months earlier participated in phase two, a 2-month supplementation period and reevaluation. No racial differences were observed in folate status, as indicated by amount of folate in the blood and diet. Boys had significantly (p less than .05) higher folate levels in serum and erythrocytes than did girls. Thirteen percent of the boys and 40% of the girls were folate deficient as judged by amount of erythrocyte folate less than 317 nmol/L (140 ng/mL). The folate-deficient subjects had significantly (p less than .05) lower values of hemoglobin than did the normal subjects. Seventeen percent of the boys and 42% of the girls had folate intakes below the recommended dietary allowance for folate. Supplementation of 400 micrograms folic acid daily for 2 months resulted in significant (P less than .05) increases in serum folate, erythrocyte folate, and hemoglobin values and a decrease in mean corpuscular volume. Evidence of high prevalence of low folate status, positive relationship between erythrocyte folate and hemoglobin, and responses of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume to the supplement indicated that folate consumption may not be optimal in some groups of adolescents, especially in girls.\r"

The study was conducted using a 2 x 3 factorial design (two groups of subjects: exercise and nonexercise groups; three periods: baseline, 6-week, and 15-week testing sessions). Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. The pattern of change in caloric intake over time tended to be different between groups (F[2, 68] = 2.50, p = .089); the exercise group experienced a significant decrease in caloric intake by 15 weeks. Significant group x time interactions were found for intakes of carbohydrate, dietary fiber, thiamin, niacin, vitamin B-6, and folate. Intake tended to decrease in the exercise group and to increase in the nonexercise group. Change in intake of each of these nutrients was significantly correlated with change in bread and cereal consumption. The pattern of change in bread and cereal intake over time was significantly different between groups (Pillais Trace = 0.266, F[2, 33] = 5.99, p = .006); the exercise group had significant decreases in intake at 6 and 15 weeks vs baseline values. These data suggest that mildly obese women reduce energy intake subsequent to initiating an exercise program; concomitantly there is a decrease in the quality of nutrient intake from their diets compared with those of sedentary controls.\r"

This article describes the development and implementation of a prototype for interdisciplinary nutritional evaluation and intervention in an outpatient setting. In 1987, a Regional Nutrition and Feeding Diagnosis and Evaluation Clinic was established through a contractual agreement between the University of Georgia University Affiliated Program and St. Mary's Hospital in Athens, GA. The purposes of the clinic are twofold: to offer direct services to developmentally disabled infants and children who require outpatient services and to provide a unique community-based interdisciplinary training experience for graduate students in nutrition and other health disciplines. The interdisciplinary treatment protocol is based on current knowledge in the treatment of developmental disabilities.\r"

Exposure to excessive iodine through foods, dietary supplements, topical medications, and/or iodinated contrast media has resulted in thyroiditis, goiter, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, sensitivity reactions, or acute responses for some individuals. Reports of maternal iodine exposure during pregnancy or lactation affecting newborn or nursing infants are cited. Susceptibility to excess iodine is discussed as well as the relationship between dose and response. It is concluded that some individuals can tolerate very high levels of iodine with no apparent side effects and that iodine intakes less than or equal to 1.000 mg/day are probably safe for the majority of the population, but may cause adverse effects in some individuals. Determination of maximum tolerable levels of iodine intake will require human experimental studies at levels between 0.150 and 1.000 mg/day for normal subjects, subjects with autonomous thyroid tissue, and iodine-sensitive subjects.\r"

A randomized clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy (maintenance or improvement in mental, emotional, and physical function) of using a geriatric assessment process in acute hospital care without increasing hospital charges or lengths of stay. Four hundred thirty-six patients greater than or equal to 75 years of age were randomly allocated to treatment (n = 221) or control (n = 215) conditions. Patients in the treatment group were admitted to a special unit and evaluated on admission by an interdisciplinary team, which developed a care plan. Although primary care was provided by the patient's own physician, the team followed the patients as consultants on the unit in the hospital, and by telephone for 2 months after discharge. The control group was placed on other units and received usual hospital care. The treatment and control groups were similar at study entry. At follow-up, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to lengths of stay, hospital charges, mortality, change in physical function, or change in mental function. The treatment group changed more often in measured emotional function (chi 2 = 6.213, P = .045). This study indicates that it is feasible to implement consultative interdisciplinary team care in the acute-care hospital, but that its efficacy may be limited when applied to an unselected group of older patients.\r"

The Senior Care Study, a randomized controlled trial, compared a multidisciplinary-team approach to patient care to the standard medical practice of the institution. As a part of the trial, the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary team intervention in improving the use of medications was studied. Study goals were to decrease medications used, decrease unnecessary medications, and improve medication choices in our acutely ill inpatient population. A pharmacist interviewed all experimental patients and patient records, and presented medication concerns and recommendations at a team conference. Medications were counted on admission and on the third day, sixth week, and third month after randomization. Medications were paired with patient problems. Medication:problem pairs were judged as inappropriate choices if there were potential side effects that would affect patient function, and if better alternatives were available. The 215 control and 221 experimental patients in the study were similar in age, sex, place of origin, and number of medications on admission. Experimental patients took fewer medications than controls on the third day (5.3 versus 5.9, P less than .05). Experimental patients received fewer multiple unpaired medications (11% versus 19%, P less than .025) and fewer inappropriate medication choices (20% versus 37%, P less than .005). The results suggest that the team intervention was effective in improving pharmacotherapy in the acute-care setting.\r"

To determine the effect of testing site on the performance of elderly patients undergoing a comprehensive geriatric assessment, we administered the Mini-Mental State Exam to 116 geriatric patients in the clinic and at their residence. Their cognitive abilities varied from normal to severely impaired. The patients' scores were 1.5 +/- 3.6 (mean +/- SD) higher at their residence. The clinical importance of a difference in score of 1.5 is not clear. For this reason a second analysis was performed in which a difference in scores of five points or greater between settings was considered clinically meaningful. Twenty-five percent (29 of 116) differed by five points or more. Of these 29 patients, 22 (76%) tested better in the residential setting. These differences were statistically significant (P = .001). We conclude that the testing site may affect test performance and that in-home assessment may reveal the optimal cognitive function of geriatric patients.\r"

  ".W": "Clinicians usually employ indirect measures of cognitive and physical function in order to assess medical decision-making capacity. We tested a reference group of well elderly (Mini-Mental State Exam [MMSE] score = 29.1 +/- 0.8, mean +/- SD), for their understanding of three increasingly complex, hypothetical treatment situations or \"vignettes\"--use of a hypnotic, need for thoracocentesis, and desire for CPR. From this, we have developed a more direct, Guttman-like assessment of decision-making capacity. Of 51 Veterans Affairs nursing home residents (MMSE score = 22.4 +/- 6.9), only 33.3% demonstrated intact decision-making capacity by this method, whereas 77% were felt by their primary physicians to be capable of giving consent for oral surgery; 37.3% had very impaired decision-making capacity; and 29.4% were intermediate in this ability. Judged against our more direct assessment of decision-making capacity, primary physicians' judgment of capacity for consent was 31% to 39% sensitive in identifying impaired decision-making and the MMSE was 53% to 63% sensitive. These measures were 100% and 82% to 83% specific in identifying intact decision-making capacity, respectively. We conclude that (1) more directly assessed decision-making capacity varies noticeably among elderly nursing home residents and correlates in only limited fashion with frequently used cognitive screening methods; and (2) cognitive screening tests underestimate the prevalence of impaired decision-making capacity in this population. For informed consent and advance directives, our study suggests that decision-making capacity should be directly, rather than indirectly, assessed.\r"

  ".W": "Direct observation of physical function has the advantage of providing an objective, quantifiable measure of functional capabilities. We have developed the Physical Performance Test (PPT), which assesses multiple domains of physical function using observed performance of tasks that simulate activities of daily living of various degrees of difficulty. Two versions are presented: a nine-item scale that includes writing a sentence, simulated eating, turning 360 degrees, putting on and removing a jacket, lifting a book and putting it on a shelf, picking up a penny from the floor, a 50-foot walk test, and climbing stairs (scored as two items); and a seven-item scale that does not include stairs. The PPT can be completed in less than 10 minutes and requires only a few simple props. We then tested the validity of PPT using 183 subjects (mean age, 79 years) in six settings including four clinical practices (one of Parkinson's disease patients), a board-and-care home, and a senior citizens' apartment. The PPT was reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87 and 0.79, interrater reliability = 0.99 and 0.93 for the nine-item and seven-item tests, respectively) and demonstrated concurrent validity with self-reported measures of physical function. Scores on the PPT for both scales were highly correlated (.50 to .80) with modified Rosow-Breslau, Instrumental and Basic Activities of Daily Living scales, and Tinetti gait score. Scores on the PPT were more moderately correlated with self-reported health status, cognitive status, and mental health (.24 to .47), and negatively with age (-.24 and -.18). Thus, the PPT also demonstrated construct validity. The PPT is a promising objective measurement of physical function, but its clinical and research value for screening, monitoring, and prediction will have to be determined.\r"

We evaluated the potential usefulness, reliability, and validity of four hierarchical measures of physical function in 123 elderly subjects seen in four ambulatory geriatrics settings. Although the vast majority (83.2%) of subjects were fully independent on the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale, a broader scope of functional difficulty was reported on the Spector-Katz, five-item OARS, and Rosow-Breslau scales. The three scales all had either borderline or more acceptable coefficients of scalability (0.57-0.77); the hierarchical order of items was not observed in 5.3% to 13.6% of subjects. Combining items from these established measures resulted in two new scales with acceptable scalability and construct validity; however, some errors in item order persisted. Although their ease of administration is clearly advantageous, clinicians using short hierarchical scales to assess functional status of older patients should be aware of their limitations.\r"

  ".W": "The extent of functional disability measured by performance of a series of simple manual tasks was determined in 1,286 elderly people, aged 66 to 98, who resided in central North Carolina. Missing data left 1,106 subjects for analysis. Poor manual performance was defined by either of two criteria: (1) inability to complete all the test items, or (2) taking longer than 350 seconds to complete the test. Using the first criterion, 113 persons (10.2%) were poor performers. When the two writing items were omitted from the analysis, 28 persons (2.4%) were in the poor performance group. Of the 993 persons who completed all items, 59 persons (5.9%) performed poorly. Using both criteria, the extent of functional disability was 16.1%; excluding the writing items, the extent of poor performance was 8.3%. Compared to those who performed well, those who performed poorly were older, poorer, less educated, more likely to be black, and less healthy. Because manual ability correlates highly with functional dependency and identifies those at risk for increased care needs, the magnitude of manual dysfunction noted in this survey has important implications for care providers and policy-makers.\r"

  ".W": "Whether the well-documented age-associated decline in the glomerular filtration rate, manifest as a decline in creatinine clearance, is secondary to an age-related change in cardiovascular performance is at present unknown. To answer this question, we measured arterial blood pressure, 24-hour creatinine clearance, and cardiac output determined from gated cardiac blood pool scans in the sitting position in healthy normotensive men (n = 75) and women (n = 42) (ages 25 to 82 years), from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. These subjects were selected for the absence of cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and confounding medications. By linear regression analysis, creatinine clearance, expressed in mL/min/m2, declined cross-sectionally with age (creatinine clearance = 90 -0.33[age], r = .31, P less than .001), whereas systolic blood pressure in mm Hg increased with age (systolic blood pressure = 111 + 0.27[age], r = .30, P less than .001); cardiac output in L/min/m2 did not vary with age (r = .03, P = .74). In stepwise multiple regression analysis with age, cardiac index, and systolic blood pressure as independent variables and creatinine clearance as the dependent variable, only age was a significant predictor of creatinine clearance. (F = 11.31, DF + 116, r = .30, P less than .001). Thus, the age-associated decline in creatinine clearance is not modulated by changes in cardiac index or systolic blood pressure in healthy normotensive subjects.\r"

It was hypothesized that the driving population was operating at a higher cognitive and functional level than nondrivers. One hundred eighty-two subjects meeting the entry criteria were studied. Twenty-three percent of the subjects were driving at the time of their assessment. Compared to nondrivers, drivers were younger (P = .0001), were more likely to be male (P = .003), scored higher on a mental status examination (P = .0001), and were more independent in Physical and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (P less than .0001). Despite these findings, the mean Folstein Mini-Mental score for drivers (23.7) was below normal; 40% of drivers were diagnosed as having Alzheimer's dementia at the time of their evaluation, and over 26% of the drivers needed help with either dressing or bathing. The frequency of impaired elderly drivers in this referral setting was high. The authors conclude that conditions that affect the driving task are common in geriatric assessment centers. Prospective studies of elderly drivers are needed to answer the difficult question of who among the elderly should drive.\r"

An age-related alteration in a biological parameter is not necessarily a biomarker of aging. None of the previously observed age-related changes satisfies all the criteria. Potential biomarkers that are applicable to human aging include in vitro proliferative capacity of fibroblasts, glycation of collagen, and DNA unwinding rate. Future research should focus on identifying age-related changes that are not merely expressions of aging, but also have some causal link to aging.\r"

At present, the only validated biomarker of aging is maximum life span, which remains impractical for human use. Identification of other biomarkers awaits development of a method of biomarker validation. This paper outlines an approach for this purpose intended for selecting biomarkers usable in humans. Prospective biomarkers are validated and weighted according to their correlation with interventions that, in healthy individuals, influence life span, namely mortality risk factors. A general mathematical method is presented for combining biomarker scores into an index of aging rate. This method addresses problems encountered with the traditional (multiple regression) method of calculating biological age and develops an index termed standardized biological age, SBA. In applying the method to 2,462 office workers, SBA, based on 12 physiological tests under investigation as biomarkers of aging, was found to depend on most of 17 surveyed dietary, exercise, life style, and geographical risk factors for mortality or health, suggesting that many risk factors predict rates of common functional declines with age. The 12 candidate biomarkers of aging in this study differed widely in validity according to the criterion employed. The approach holds promise for assembling an experimentally useful battery of biomarkers of aging.\r"

Body mass and colonic temperature were measured before each test, and colonic temperature, O2 consumption, and CO2 production were measured during cold exposure. The slopes of colonic temperature and heat production and the mean metabolic heat production were calculated for each animal. Adult mice showed stronger cold tolerance compared to aged mice and also exhibited habituation to cold exposure (improvement of cold tolerance with repeated tests). Mean metabolic heat production during cold exposure was greater in adult mice, and only adults demonstrated significant increases across tests in both metabolic heat production and slope of metabolic heat production over time. We hypothesize that reduced cold tolerance in aged mice is related mainly to a decrease in metabolic heat production. Increased metabolic heat production in subsequent tests in adults is a probable mechanism for habituation to repeated cold exposure.\r"

Rats were sacrificed at 5, 14, and 21 days after operation, and the mucosa was weighed and assayed for DNA, RNA, protein, and polyamine concentration and content. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was also measured in ileal mucosa at 5 days after surgery. Young rats had completed the adaptive hyperplastic response within 2 weeks after operation by all biochemical measurements; similar adaptation was not seen until 3 weeks after operation in the old rats. We conclude that although the capacity to achieve intestinal adaptation after enterectomy is preserved into old age in rats, this compensatory response is delayed.\r"

The elderly are \"fatter\" at any given relative weight and often have similar metabolic abnormalities. In this study we compare body composition, circumferences, and specific fat depots areas in a population of healthy young and older men. Although the two groups were similar in body mass index and percent body fat, their distribution of adiposity was different. The young subjects had 16% and 10% larger thigh (p = .0001) and arm (p less than .01) circumferences respectively, while the ratio of waist-to-hip circumference was greater in the older subjects (0.93 +/- 0.04 vs 0.97 +/- 0.04, p = less than .01). The most striking differences between the groups were noted on computed tomography, with a twofold greater IA fat area (72.6 +/- 38.2 vs 143.6 +/- 56.2 cm2, p less than .0001), and a twofold lesser thigh subcutaneous fat area (156.3 +/- 69.3 vs 82.4 +/- 29.7 cm2, p less than .001) in the older subjects. We conclude there is an age-related central and intraabdominal redistribution of adipose mass, even in healthy older subjects. Since these changes occur in the absence of clinical disease, the associations between metabolic abnormalities and a central and or IA distribution of adiposity in the elderly must be investigated further.\r"

Seven-day diet records were collected from 105 free-living men in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Age range was initially 27 to 65 and finally 50 to 88 years. The men were divided into age groups so that longitudinal, time series, and cross-sectional analyses could distinguish among differences due to aging, cohort, and secular change. Longitudinal decreases over three decades of time include height, intakes of kcal/day, kcal/kg, kcal from fat, and cholesterol (all p less than .0001). Longitudinal increases over time include body weight, intakes of kcal from alcohol (p = .002), kcal from carbohydrate, and polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio (P/S) (all p less than .0001). Values that correlated cross-sectionally with age in the 1960s were height, kcal/day, kcal/kg, kcal from protein, and P/S ratio; height, intakes of kcal from protein, and fiber in the 1970s; and body weight, height, intakes of kcal from carbohydrate and fiber in the 1980s (all p less than .05). Protein consumption remained constant while carbohydrate increased as time passed. The more striking secular changes were in type and amount of fat consumed (42% to 34% of kcal, a 37% decline in cholesterol and a 72% increase in P/S ratio). Voluntary changes in the diets of these community-dwelling men indicate that, at any age, men can make beneficial changes in intake of nutrients that affect health.\r"

We evaluated FR in 128 volunteers (age 21-87 years). FR was determined with a precise electronic device and a simple clinical apparatus (yardstick). FR correlates with COPE (Pearson r = .71) and is precise (coefficient of variation = 2.5%) and stable (intraclass correlation coefficient across days = .81). Age and height influence FR. FR is portable, inexpensive, reliable, precise, and a reasonable clinical approximator of the margin of stability. FR may be useful for detecting balance impairment, change in balance performance over time, and in the design of modified environments for impaired older persons.\r"

We followed National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines for serum cholesterol (less than 200 mg/dl \"desirable,\" 200-239 \"borderline-high,\" and greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl \"high\"). Of 4,011 61-70 year-olds, only 19% had capillary blood total cholesterol less than 200, 38% were 200-239, and 43% greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl.

In 215 subjects, 81 and over, 29% had total cholesterol less than 200, 36% were 200-239, and 35% were greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl. Application of the non-age, non-race, non-sex specific National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines to the elderly may necessitate followup and perhaps therapy in 71-81% of subjects, suggesting that the appropriate intervention approach be general population-oriented, rather than the individual detection, diagnosis, and treatment approach which presents a huge, expensive load for a relatively unprepared health care community.\r"

Decrement in hand function is a significant musculoskeletal impairment influencing limitations in Basic ADL, and progression of Instrumental ADL dysfunction is influenced by progression of lower extremity impairments. Progression of sight and hearing impairments was not associated with change in physical disability. Musculoskeletal impairments, one of the most prevalent and symptomatic chronic complaints of middle and old age, deserve increased attention from epidemiologists, disability researchers, and clinicians seeking ways to prevent disablement among the aged.\r"

The prevalence of hypertension among subgroups of different acculturation was ascertained based on the modified Cuellar Acculturation Scale. Each age group was also stratified using the HHANES poverty index, with those above the index compared to those below. A stepwise logistic regression was performed among the variables of poverty, gender, age, and acculturation in relation to hypertension. The results indicate that acculturation and age are stronger predictors of hypertension than poverty in elderly Mexican Americans, with acculturation being a stronger predictor among those age 55-64. Factors related to acculturation may have a stronger influence on the prevalence of hypertension in older Mexican Americans than differences related to socioeconomic status.\r"

The number of \"tip of the tongue\" (TOT) naming responses as a proportion of faces recognized increased with age, while the number of responses where the right name was produced correspondingly decreased with age. Following responses of No, TOT, and Yes to \"Do you know his name?\", older subjects reported fewer correct semantic features than younger subjects in all three cases; but as proportions of the number of correct semantic features following Yes responses, there were no age effects (.21 and .59 for No and TOT responses, respectively). In multiple regression analyses, age surprisingly was often a better predictor of performance than measures of current cognitive ability. The results are interpreted as evidence of impairment with age associated with at least three stages in the face recognition process as identified by Bruce and Young (1986).\r"

  ".W": "The impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists was assessed in 60 elderly community-dwelling adults. Participants were divided into four groups: (a) skills training plus incentive, (b) skills training only, (c) placebo plus incentive, and (d) placebo without incentive. The memory skills training involved 2 hours of class instruction and a take-home manual. The incentive was introduced following the posttest study interval, prior to recall, and was in the form of a lottery. The three experimental groups (skills only, skills plus incentive, and incentive only) recalled more words at the posttest interval than the placebo group. Skills training was associated with the greatest number of words recalled, followed by the incentive. No additional performance gains were found when skills training was coupled with incentive. A significant relationship between study time and word recall performance was found at posttest. Those who received skills training used more study time than did the no skills groups. The results suggest that teaching an active memory skill enhances free recall performance. Additionally, incentives were superior to no training. Combining incentives with skills, however, does not extend memory performance over skills training alone.\r"

Results were consistent with the hypothesis that bridge, which provides specific experience in working memory and reasoning, should enhance performance in tasks tapping these abilities and not enhance performance in unrelated abilities. Because the data were correlational, the rival hypothesis that bridge playing selects for individuals who perform better at working memory and reasoning tasks could not be rejected.\r"

The FES showed good test-retest reliability (Pearson's correlation 0.71). Subjects who reported avoiding activities because of fear of falling had higher FES scores, representing lower self-efficacy or confidence, than subjects not reporting fear of falling. The independent predictors of FES score were usual walking pace (a measure of physical ability), anxiety, and depression. The FES appears to be a reliable and valid method for measuring fear of falling. This instrument may be useful in assessing the independent contribution of fear of falling to functional decline among elderly people.\r"

The present study attempted to verify whether these five aspects of meaning were related to unique combinations of demographic, social, personal, and health variables. Zero-order correlations showed high intercorrelations among Kivnick's five subscales, and low correlations among the majority of variables. Regression analyses indicated that no more than 30% of the variance in any one of the dimensions could be explained and that considerable overlap existed in the significant predictors across aspects of meanings.\r"

Reported estimates of the size of the elderly population with ADL disabilities differ substantially across national surveys. Differences in which ADL items are being measured and in what constitutes a disability account for much of the variation. Other likely explanations are differences in sample design, sample size, survey methodology, and age structure of the population to which the sample refers. When essentially equivalent ADL measures are compared, estimates for the community-based population vary by up to 3.1 percentage points; and for the institutionalized population, with the exception of toileting, by no more than 3.2 percentage points. As small as these differences are in absolute terms, they can be large in percent differences across surveys. For example, the National Medical Expenditure Survey estimates that there are 60 percent more elderly people with ADL problems than does the Supplement on Aging.\r"

Here we consider each separately, then go on to analyze the simultaneous determinants of living and care arrangements. Factors influencing these outcomes can be categorized as indicators of opportunities, resources, needs, or preferences. Of particular interest is the extent to which kin availability--specifically, the existence of living children--constrains opportunities, the role of financial resources, and the consequences of needs as revealed by levels of physical and mental disability. Our analysis consists of multinomial-logit models estimated with data from the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey. The results indicate the importance of kin availability, with striking differences in the living and care arrangements between childless and other older women. Among those with children, there are less striking but consistent differences according to the number and sex composition of living children. Finally, variables representing needs for care are generally the strongest predictors of all the outcomes analyzed.\r"

In predicting admissions, major factors were found to be ethnicity (Blacks and Hispanics were at much lower risk), homeownership, advancing age, living alone, exhibiting higher cognitive and functional impairment levels, physician use, and living in an area with a larger nursing home bed supply. The probability of being discharged alive was predicted by several factors, including ethnicity (Blacks being less likely to be discharged), homeownership, being of younger age, better (self-rated) health, functional and cognitive capacities, and medical acuity.\r"

Disability associated with chronic illness and ADL impairment was related to increased reports of symptoms of emotional and psychosomatic distress. Measures of social contacts and instrumental support exerted small to moderate effects on life satisfaction, psychosomatic distress, and emotional distress. Affective support moderated the effects of health-related strain on mental health.\r"

Cellular oncogenes contribute to malignant transformation when they become activated by point mutation, translocation, amplification, or loss of regulator sequences. The properties of the oncoproteins, the proteins encoded by oncogenes which are essential for carcinogenesis, are unclear. Suppressor genes normally suppress the tumorigenic phenotype by keeping the growth of cells in check; it is their inactivation that contributes to malignant transformation. Development of colon cancer appears to take place by stepwise accumulation of multiple genetic alterations during the progression from normal colon to adenoma and carcinoma. Activation of ras, an early event in this sequence, is found in 50% of colon cancers; overexpression of c-myc is found in approximately 80%. Inactivation of suppressor genes, which occurs during later stages, is noted in greater than 70% of tumors. A current model of colonic tumorigenesis is presented.\r"

No lower bleeder had a ratio of greater than or equal to 36, whereas 38% of upper bleeders had a ratio of greater than or equal to 36. The BUN/Cr ratio may be an easy, cheap method of distinguishing upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding in some cases.

All patients had recordings of gastrointestinal manometry; 16 also had a scintigraphic measurement of gastric emptying. Measurements were compared with data from healthy controls. Gastric manometry, which could be assessed only in the group with an intact antrum, was characterized by antral hypomotility (p less than 0.05). Gastric emptying studies showed rapid early emptying of liquids and delayed emptying of solids (both p less than 0.05). In the whole group, fasting jejunal motility was characterized by absence of phase II in 13, presence of bursts of phasic activity in 18, and abnormal propagation of phase III in 8. A significantly increased frequency of phase III of MMC was noted in the patients after Billroth II and Roux-en-Y operations.

In one, the severity and poor initial response of rosacea to treatment was clearly related to the activity of the ulcerative colitis, and the rosacea improved only after proctocolectomy. While it is possible that this purported association is fortuitous, we report these cases in the hope that others may have seen this combination of diseases, to our knowledge previously unreported.\r"

The similar management of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which are thought to be differing though related disorders, suggests that therapy is nonspecific. The variation in therapeutic practices results from the fact that the etiologies of the diseases are obscure, from limited knowledge of the biological and pharmacological actions of drugs commonly prescribed (sulfasalazine, 5-ASA compounds, steroids, 6-MP and azathioprine), from an inadequate understanding of genetic differences influencing drug metabolism, from insufficient awareness of the factors influencing drug efficiency (concurrent use of antimotility drugs, cigarette smoking, food combinations), from the variability of the patient groups studied (extent and severity of disease), and from incomplete documentation of the clinical status of patients at the time of therapeutic trial. Future advances in treatment will depend on gaining new information about the nature of IBD and of drug pharmacology and bioavailability, derived from collaborative studies by clinicians, clinical investigators, and basic scientists. Important areas for IBD research include the biology of intestinal epithelium, the nature of the IBD inflammatory reaction and of gut mucosal immune regulation (via the application of new biotechnologies) and more representative experimental animal models. Decisive multicenter therapeutic studies require agreement on definitions of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, accurate characterization of patient groups, acceptable objective criteria of IBD severity and activity, and reliable indicators of therapeutic response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All but 2 of 52 patients without concomitant parasitic infection or bacterial pathogens in stool had gastrointestinal symptoms (41 abdominal pain, 26 diarrhea, and 5 vomiting), but no association was seen with fever, peripheral leukocytosis, stool occult blood, fecal leukocytes, or endoscopic or radiologic evidence of colitis. Therefore, B. hominis was frequently recovered from stools examined in a hospital clinical parasitology laboratory. The clinical presentations of patients in our series did not suggest that B. hominis was invasive. Most patients with B. hominis probably do not require treatment since they will either have spontaneous resolution of symptoms or will be found to have an alternative explanation for their problem.\r"

During an 8-year period, we observed 90 patients affected by decompensated cirrhosis: 36 of them (40%) turned out by cholecystographic/cholangiographic or ultrasonographic examination to have cholelithiasis. We were not able to demonstrate any correlation between cholelithiasis and sex, age of patients, etiology of cirrhosis, severity of the illness, degree of portal hypertension, previous gastrointestinal bleeding, number of pregnancies, or levels of serum cholesterol, bilirubin, and triglycerides. During the follow-up observation, (range, 1-91 months), 30 patients died. Survival curves analyzed by the log-rank test did not show any difference between patients with or without gallstones. We therefore confirm that cirrhosis is a lithogenic condition, but we were not able to explain the reasons for the close relationship between cholelithiasis and cirrhosis.

With a reference group of 30-39-year-olds as a comparison, multiple logistic regression analysis showed a trend effect with odds ratios of 1.73, 3.74, and 6.32 for age groups of 40-49, 50-59, and 60 or above, respectively. The odds ratio for DM was as high as 2.59. However, sex, body weight index, chronic hepatitis B, and hyperlipidemia were not significantly associated with gallstones.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the prevalence of gallstones in patients with upper abdominal pain, heaviness, or discomfort by ultrasound examination of the gallbladder. The actual ultrasound examination was performed by a clinical gastroenterologist blinded to the symptoms. Of 1,680 consecutive dyspeptic patients, 500 (29.8%) had gallstones. The gallbladder was contracted in 450 (91.2%), normal-size in 36 (7.2%), and distended in 8 (1.6%). Biliary colic was more frequently the presenting complaint in patients with a contracted gallbladder than in those with normal size gallbladder (p less than 0.001). Dyspepsia was more frequent in the presence of a normal size gallbladder than a contracted one (p less than 0.001). We conclude that ultrasonography of the gallbladder by the clinician has a high diagnostic yield, and the symptom complex has an excellent correlation with the sonographic appearance.\r"

We retrospectively analyzed the records of 37 cases of tuberculous peritonitis diagnosed over a 15-year period, and compared the clinical and diagnostic features of cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. In cirrhotic patients, tuberculous peritonitis can simulate ascites from liver disease or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The diagnosis is difficult in these patients because the ascitic fluid may not be of the exudative type as a result of the low albumin level in serum, and lymphocytes do not predominate in all cases. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in ascitic fluid was elevated (higher than 40 U/L) in all 11 patients (four patients with hepatic cirrhosis). The time required to achieve a correct diagnosis was significantly longer in cirrhotic than in noncirrhotic patients. The overall mortality was 13%, with deaths occurring exclusively among cirrhotic patients. We emphasize that tuberculous peritonitis in cirrhotic patients can present an atypical picture. A considerable element of suspicion is necessary.\r"

In 11 patients, spontaneous reactivation occurred as a single episode and in eight patients, reactivation was recurrent, with two to five episodes each. The mean serum alanine aminotransferase level was elevated over 10-fold at the peak of reactivation. Serum anti-HBc IgM was detected during 73% of the reactivation episodes. Actuarial analysis revealed that reactivation was long lasting with 45% and nearly 20% of episodes continued after 6 and 24 months, respectively. The course of 24 chronic HBV carriers with a negative serum HBV DNA test and normal alanine aminotransferase levels at initial appearance was unremarkable. We could not identify clinical features predictive of reactivation or its resolution. Severe reactivation hepatitis occurred in three patients (10%), with two deaths (6%). None of the patients lost HBsAg. Spontaneous reactivation in chronic hepatitis B can appear variably, persist long term, recur, and be fatal. Therefore, accurate classification of chronic HBV infection requires prolonged observation, and spontaneous reactivation should be considered a variable in therapeutic trials for chronic hepatitis B.\r"

The case resembled a Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with high acid output (basal acid output 27, sham meal-stimulated 37, maximum acid output 47 mEq/h), but with fasting gastrin 43 pg/ml, nonresponsive to secretin. As in ZES, pepsin output was comparatively low, and secretion was inhibitable by atropine (50% inhibited by 1 microM). The tumor removed at surgery contained less than 1 ng gastrin per gram, but was many times more potent than pentagastrin in stimulating acid from a lumen-perfused rat stomach. The tumor also contained cholecystokinin (CCK-8 and CCK-33), motilin, insulin, and somatostatin, which were also present in adjacent normal pancreas; in addition, the tumor contained pancreatic polypeptide and pancreatic cancer-associated antigen. This case represents a rare syndrome due to an as yet undefined peptide secreted by a (frequently malignant) pancreatic endocrine tumor and masquerading as ZES. This is the first report of studies of pepsin secretion and of the effect of atropine, suggesting that the physiologic effects of the secretagogue resemble that of gastrin.\r"

Cholesterol stones were found in the intrahepatic bile duct of the left lateral lobe in two cases and in both the left lateral and the right posterior lobe in one. Although the chronic inflammatory reaction and fibrous thickening of bile duct wall were similar in both types of hepatolithiasis, the proliferation of intrahepatic periductal glands and the production of mucin were rather mild, compared to that is the liner containing calcium bilirubinate stones. Multiple intramural cholesterol calculi and cholesterin granulomas (cholesterin crystals surrounded by foreign-body giant cells) were found within the cystically dilated small bile duct branches and/or conduits of periductal glands. The calculi and granulomas were characteristic for cholesterol hepatolithiasis. These findings suggest that the formation of the cholesterol stones differs from that of calcium bilirubinate stones; the perturbation of factors influencing cholesterol nucleation in the hepatic bile may be related to the changed microenvironment of the intrahepatic bile ducts, which is followed by the formation of cholesterol stones.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of T cells by mAb to the CD3 molecular complex induces the differentiation of many more Ig-secreting cells (ISC) from resting human B cells in bulk cultures than do other modes of polyclonal B cell activation. In the current experiments, a limiting dilution assay was used to demonstrate that this increase in ISC generation reflects an increased frequency of responding B cells. Highly purified B cells were cultured at densities of between 1000 cells and 0.5 cell per microwell with fresh, mitomycin C-treated T cells (T mito) or T cell clones stimulated by immobilized mAb to CD3. After 5 days in culture, the number of wells containing ISC was determined, and the frequency of responding B cells was calculated. The proportion of B cells responding to anti-CD3-stimulated T cells was very large (10.7 +/- 2.8%) and greatly surpassed that induced by other polyclonal activators. B cells cultured with anti-CD3-stimulated T cell clones responded better than did those cultured with T mito. The addition of exogenous IL-2 or IL-6 to cultures supported by activated T mito enhanced the frequency of responding B cells, whereas IL-4 did not increase the generation of ISC and inhibited the augmentation of B cell responses induced by IL-2. Supplementation of cultures with mitomycin C-treated B cells as accessory cells had less of an effect. The addition of both accessory cells and IL-2 markedly increased B cell responsiveness, with precursor frequencies of 60 to 80% noted. In some experiments, cultures were carried out for 7 to 14 days and supernatants were analyzed for IgM, IgG, and IgA secretion. B cells activated by anti-CD3-stimulated T cells produced all three Ig isotypes. When the classes of Ig produced by single B cells were examined, it was observed that the stimulation of individual B cell precursors led to the production of multiple Ig isotypes, suggesting that isotype switching occurs in these cultures. These results demonstrate that under optimum culture conditions, T cells stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 can activate the majority of human peripheral blood B cells to produce Ig and induce isotype switching by many.\r"

  ".W": "Cholera toxin has been used as a tool to study the effects of cAMP on the activation of B cells but may have effects independent of its ability to elevate cAMP. We found five lines of evidence which suggested that cholera toxin suppressed mitogen-stimulated B cell activation through a cAMP-independent pathway. 1) Cholera toxin (1 microgram/ml) was consistently more suppressive than forskolin (100 microM) despite the induction of higher intracellular cAMP levels by forskolin. 2) Cholera toxin was more suppressive at 1 microgram/ml than at 0.1 microgram/ml despite equivalent elevations of cAMP. 3) Washing B cells following their incubation with cholera toxin reversed much of the inhibition without altering intracellular cAMP levels. 4) The A subunit of cholera toxin, which at high concentrations (10 micrograms/ml) induced levels of cAMP comparable to those induced by cholera toxin (1 and 0.1 microgram/ml), did not inhibit B cell activation. 5) cAMP derivatives at high concentrations were much less effective than was cholera toxin in suppressing B cell activation. Although the elevation of cAMP may cause a mild inhibition of B cell proliferation, we found that even a marked elevation of cAMP did not suppress B cell proliferation, unless the elevation was persistent. We did, however, observe that the degree of toxin inhibition more closely paralleled binding of the toxin to B cells than toxin stimulation of cAMP. This result raised the possibility that binding of cholera toxin to its ganglioside GM1 receptor mediated an inhibitory signal which suppressed B cell proliferation.\r"

L cells transfected with I-Ab genes functioned as effective AC for SPE A-induced responses by C57BL/6 T cells, proliferation, and IL-2 production, but control L cells were not effective AC. Anti-I-Ab mAb inhibited the SPE A-induced responses. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B-induced C57BL/6 T cell blasts were composed of cells bearing V beta 3, members of the V beta 8 family, and V beta 11. Most of the SPE A-induced T cell blasts (about 80%) bore V beta 8.2. mAb reactive to V beta 8.2 markedly inhibited SPE A-induced T cell responses. Apparently, SPE A activates mainly T cells bearing V beta 8.2 in physical association with MHC class II molecules expressed on AC. We also discuss the pathogenic activities of SPE A in relation to toxic shock syndrome.\r"

This treatment selectively inhibits up-regulation of transcription of differentiation-related genes. Induction of anti-mu suppression requires RNA and protein synthesis, suggesting involvement of a transcriptional repressor. We describe experiments designed to capture the repressed phenotype of anti-mu-treated cells. Fusions of anti-mu-treated cells with the B lymphoma line M12.4.5, but not plasmacytoma Ag8.653, yielded a significantly lower frequency of secretory hybridomas than did parallel fusion of cells treated with LPS only. To test for active repression, nonsecreting cloned hybridomas were secondarily fused to LPS-activated normal B cells. Secondary hybridomas with anti-mu parentage had a very low frequency of IgM secretion. Active suppression could only be demonstrated by secondary fusion. Neither supernatants nor extracts of repressor hybridomas influenced LPS-driven differentiation of normal B cells. These results confirm that this form of differentiation suppression is an active process, probably mediated by transcriptional controls. Repressor hybridomas should prove useful for studies of molecular mechanisms.\r"

Anti-CD4 reagents inhibited T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and affected responses to HLA-DQ and -DR products equally well. As previously observed for conventional alloresponses, saturating concentrations of CD4 antibodies were required (and sufficient) for substantial blocking of T cell responses to transfected HLA-DQ and -DR products, and antibodies to a wide range of CD4 epitopes were inhibitory. In contrast to these results on class II-dependent T cell proliferation, MHC-independent T cell activation (via CD3 antibodies) was largely resistant to inhibition with the same dose range of CD4 mAb (provided that CD3 and CD4 reagents could not compete for the same class of FcR). This observation validates our conclusion that despite the substantial sequence differences between HLA-DQ and -DR heterodimers, the participation of CD4 epitopes in T cell responses to these molecules is conserved.\r"

Class I CTL of two fine specificity subsets map to this transmembrane (TM) site. One of these CTL subpopulations is subtype specific. These T lymphocytes recognize the site generated during infection of target cells with A/JAPAN/305/57 virus (H2N2) but not target cells expressing the comparable TM site of the influenza A/PR/8/34 virus (H1N1) hemagglutinin (P527-549) after infection with this virus. The other CTL subpopulation is cross-reactive and recognizes the TM site of the A/JAPAN/305/57 HA and the A/PR/8/34 HA with similar efficiency. Analyses of the critical amino acids in the TM site necessary for CTL recognition with the use of synthetic peptides unexpectedly revealed reactivity for the A/PR/8 HA TM site by subtype-specific CTL. This reactivity was only observed with truncated peptides corresponding to a limited portion of the A/PR/8 HA TM site but also required peptide concentrations greater than 10(-7) M. These results suggested either that the endogenously processed A/PR/8 HA TM site generated during infection was larger than the site defined by the truncated cross-reactive peptides or that the concentration of endogenously processed TM site produced during infection was limiting. To distinguish between these possibilities, we expressed in target cells synthetic minigenes encoding only the portion of the A/PR/8 HA transmembrane sites defined by the synthetic peptides. Unlike the peptides, the \"preprocessed\" endogenous minigene products were not recognized by subtype-specific CTL. These data suggest that the level of available endogenously processed Ag rather than selectivity in the site of fragmentation of newly synthesized Ag may play a critical role in determining whether the complex of the antigenic moiety and class I MHC is efficiently presented to and recognized by class I CTL.\r"

To characterize the involvement of CAM in NK and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) activities, we examined the expression of several CAM by freshly isolated human NK cells and by NK cells activated in vitro with IL-2, and compared this to CAM expression by T lymphocytes under similar conditions. Freshly isolated human NK cells were uniformly LFA-3 (CD58)+ and expressed two to three-fold higher surface levels of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) than resting T lymphocytes. More NK cells than T cells also expressed phenotypically detectable levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54). After in vitro incubation with IL-2, human NK cells demonstrated four- to sixfold increases in surface levels of CD11a/CD18, CD2, CD54, CD58, and the NK cell-associated Ag NKH-1 (CD56). Furthermore, essentially all NK cells became CD54+ within 3 days of exposure to IL-2. T cells did not demonstrate comparable up-regulation of CAM after incubation with IL-2. Increases in NK cell CAM expression were associated with enhanced formation of E:T cell conjugates, enhanced killing of NK-sensitive targets, and the induction of cytotoxicity for previously NK-resistant targets (LAK activity). The LAK activity induced by exogenous IL-2 could be partially inhibited by anti-CD2, anti-CD11a, or anti-CD54 antibodies and almost completely abrogated by anti-CD2 and anti-CD11a in combination. These studies suggest that CAM play a central role in the regulation of NK cytolysis, and that changes in CAM expression may alter the target cell specificity of activated NK effectors.\r"

The T cell specific protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), p56lck, has been implicated in the tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-zeta. However, the significance of this event with regard to CD3-Ti signal transduction remains unclear. Herein, we have investigated the effect of the selective PTK inhibitor genistein (4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone) on cellular events associated with activation via CD3-Ti triggering. Genistein inhibited the T cell PTK, p56lck, in a dose-dependent fashion with an ID50 = 40 microM. Genistein also inhibited CD3 mAb or PHA-induced TCR-zeta chain phosphorylation in intact peripheral blood T cells. Genistein blocked the expression of IL-2 and IL-2R (CD25) in T cells stimulated with PHA/PMA or CD3 mAb/PMA, but did not inhibit the de novo expression of the CD69 early activation Ag, which is induced primarily by a PKC-dependent pathway. IL-2 and CD25 expression induced by calcium ionophore A23187 and PMA was largely refractory to inhibition by genistein, suggesting an effect of the drug on calcium-dependent pathways stimulated via CD3-Ti triggering. In this last regard, genistein partially inhibited the CD3 mAb-induced rise in [Ca2+]i but did not inhibit PHA- or CD3 mAb-induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. Consequently, protein-tyrosine phosphorylation does not appear to be a prerequisite for CD3-Ti-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity and PIP2 hydrolysis. An alternative role for PTK in CD3-Ti signal transduction is suggested.\r"

Because activated macrophages are a major source of IL-1 and have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, we investigated the regulation of IL-1 expression in several autoimmune-prone strains of mice. Peritoneal macrophages derived from the autoimmune-prone strains MRL/lpr, MRL/+, NZB, and NZB/W F1, as well as NZW, displayed transient expression of IL-1 in contrast to the stable expression characteristic of control normal strains including A. Thy, A/J, B10, B10.A, B10.D2, C57BL/6, BALB/c, and C3H/HeN. The down-regulation of IL-1 by macrophages from the autoimmune-prone mice was not attributable to inherently defective signal transduction because macrophages from both the normal and autoimmune-prone strains displayed substantial initial levels of cell-associated and secreted IL-1. However, during the first 2 to 3 days in culture, macrophages from autoimmune-prone mice became progressively refractory to both induction and maintenance of IL-1, a pattern that correlated with changes in the levels of IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA. The progressive reduction in IL-1 expression by macrophages from these autoimmune-prone strains was not due to a reduction in general metabolism or viability, because expression of cell surface antigens, including MHC class I and II Ag and LFA-1, was comparable to that of control macrophages. Because IL-1 plays a critical role in the homeostasis of a variety of cell lineages, defective expression, and maintenance of IL-1 (and perhaps other cytokines) by macrophages from the autoimmune-prone strains may contribute to the immune dysregulation that develops in these mice. Alternatively, cytokine dysregulation might not contribute directly to disease, but rather reflect a more basic defect related to specific signal transducing or gene regulatory pathways.\r"

However, when chronically infected MOLT-4 cells were treated with 0.5 beta mAb, recovered viruses from the 0.5 beta-treated cells showed no antigenic changes. The extent of genomic variation among antigenically distinct isolates was examined by nucleotide sequencing, which revealed a few base substitutions in 0.5 beta-binding site of all mutants isolated. The predicted amino acid replacements within 0.5 beta reacting epitope (V3 domain) causing the altered antigenicity were also identified for each of three isolates. Particularly, in one of the mutants, the most conserved Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg region located at the center of the V3 domain was changed to Gly-Gln-Gly-Arg. The radioimmunoprecipitation and synthetic peptide analyses revealed that this Pro320----Gln substitution reduced the binding affinity with 0.5 beta, although other mutations observed in the other mutants did not affect the binding affinity in radioimmunoprecipitation. We also observed that nucleic acid substitutions in the V3 domain occurred frequently in the absence of 0.5 beta mAb during our in vitro acute infection system using MT-4 cells.\r"

  ".U": "91036965\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of lymphocyte populations to recognize and bind high endothelial venules during homing into lymphoid tissues and sites of chronic inflammation is critically dependent on their expression of certain homing-associated adhesion molecules known as homing receptors (HR). In animal models, certain lymphocyte populations, particularly subsets of memory or previously activated lymphocytes, demonstrate tissue-selective homing behavior, and it has been hypothesized that differential expression of HR accounts for this selective migration. In this study, we analyzed expression of human HR--the Dreg 56/Leu 8-defined peripheral lymph node (PLN) HR (also known as LECAM-1), H-CAM (CD44), and alpha 4-integrins (CD49d; VLA-4)--among subsets of thymocytes and peripheral blood T cells to identify populations with differential homing potential. In the thymus, these three HR classes are differentially regulated relative to phenotypically defined maturational stages, but are all expressed on the mature, surface CD3high subset. In the peripheral blood, virgin T cells (LFA-3/CD58low) show uniform high expression of the PLN HR, uniform relatively low expression of H-CAM and alpha 4-integrin, and lack markers of tissue association--the mucosal and cutaneous lymphocyte associated Ag (MLA and CLA Ags) defined by mAb Ber ACT8 and HECA-452, respectively. In contrast, circulating memory T cells (LFA-3/CD58high) are bimodal with respect to PLN HR expression, show uniform high expression of H-CAM and alpha 4-integrin, and contain essentially all the CLA and MLA Ag-bearing T cells. The circulating skin-associated T cell subset (CLA Ag+; 10 to 15% of total T cells) is predominantly PLN HR+, and shows high levels of both the alpha 4- and beta 1-integrin chains. The distinct mucosa-associated T cell subset (MLA Ag+; 1 to 3% of peripheral blood T cells) is predominantly PLN HR-; and is alpha 4high, but beta 1low. These findings indicate the independent regulation of homing-associated adhesion molecules among populations of memory/previously activated T cells, and suggest that the expression patterns of these molecules contribute to, or perhaps determine, the tissue distribution of these subsets.\r"

In vivo studies of 125I-CSF-1 uptake and degradation and in vitro studies of 125I-CSF-1 binding by splenic cells demonstrated that within 24 h of the reaction the number of CSF-1 receptor+ cells had increased by 2-fold and their capacity to express the CSF-1 receptor by approximately 3-fold, resulting in a approximately 2.5-fold increase in the splenic clearance of CSF-1 from the circulation. Inasmuch as at 24 h, serum CSF-1 was not significantly altered, these results are suggestive of an increased rate of release of CSF-1 into the circulation early in the response. The splenic CSF-1-receptor bearing cells were in a Mac-1+ fraction that is consistent with a role for CSF-1 in the generation of host-derived splenic macrophages in acute graft-vs-host reaction.\r"

We hypothesized that such self-implants survive because they induce tolerance to the eye-specific Ag. We have developed evidence to support this hypothesis by studying the responses of embryonically enucleated or intact frogs, with or without eye implants, to self-lens proteins. After immunization with a low concentration of bovine lens proteins, spleen cells from all intact and all embryonically enucleated frogs displayed significant in vitro proliferation against the Ag. All animals in both groups of frogs also produced high titered xenoantibodies. After immunization with a comparable preparation and concentration of self-lens Ag, splenocytes from only some of the embryonically enucleated and intact frogs showed significant proliferation, and fewer of these frogs produced antibody. When the immunization protocol and Ag concentration were modified to evoke consistent anti-self-lens proliferative and antibody responses from enucleated frogs, intact frogs responded equally well. Because there were no significant differences in the magnitude of the responses, and the percent of enucleated and intact frogs responding did not differ, we conclude that there is little or no immunologic tolerance to self-lens Ag in intact frogs. When either embryonically enucleated or intact frogs were heterotopically implanted with isogeneic eyes and then immunized with self-lens Ag or foreign lens Ag using the optimal immunization protocol, the Ag-specific proliferative responses of their lymphocytes were significantly reduced after immunization with self-, but not foreign Ag. This argues that embryonically enucleated frogs can become tolerant of the organ-specific Ag of the lens, even in adult life.\r"

Five clones producing mAb to gp41 and five producing mAb to p24 were identified. The anti-HIV-1 human mAb were tested in neutralization and cell fusion assays in the form of cell culture supernatants at concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 22.0 micrograms/ml. None of the human mAb were found either to inhibit HIV-1-(IIIB or RF) associated cell fusion or to neutralize HIV-1 (IIIB) infection of AA5 cells. All human mAb were additionally tested in 6 h 51Cr release assays for their ability to direct HIV-1 specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). For ADCC assays, PBMC were isolated from healthy seronegative donors and used as effector cells. HIV-1 infected (IIIB, RF, and MN) CEM.NKR cells as well as CEM.NKR cells with purified gp120 adsorbed onto their surface served as targets. None of the anti-p24 mAb mediated ADCC. In contrast, three of the anti-gp41 mAb were able to direct a significant level of ADCC against each of the infected targets, but as expected, failed to lyse gp120 adsorbed cells. To define the specific epitopes against which the anti-gp41 mAb were directed, seven small peptides homologous to regions within the extracellular domain of gp41 were synthesized. Using RIA, two of the mAb could be mapped. The most effective ADCC-directing human mAb bound to a peptide comprising amino acids 644-663, whereas the least effective ADCC directing anti-gp41 human mAb bound to a region within the immunodominant portion of gp41 outlined by amino acids 579-604. Together, these results for the first time assign a functional activity to human mAb directed at specific regions within gp41 by demonstrating that areas within this molecule can serve as targets for ADCC.\r"

Using P----F1 combinations involving either an H-2K only difference or an H-2D only difference, MCMV infection of F1 mice 3 days before the injection of parental spleen cells led to a profound T cell immunodeficiency that strongly resembled that observed in acute GVHD. Further studies examining the H-2K disparate P----F1 combination, C57Bl/6---- (C57Bl/6xB6.C-H-2bm1) F1 and combined MCMV infection showed that the immunodeficiency is characterized by a profound loss of in vitro Th cell production of IL-2 and an intrinsic defect in T effector function as shown by an inability of rIL-2 to restore defective CTL responses. Additional experiments in these mice revealed the presence of suppressor cells as well as significant parent-anti-F1 CTL activity possibly accounting for the suppressor effect. This pattern of immunodeficiency was not seen after the administration of either MCMV or MHC class I disparate parental cells alone. MCMV infection did not detectably alter the immunodeficiency observed in a P----F1 combination involving a MHC class II difference only. These results indicate that MCMV infection can alter the pattern of GVHD in the setting of an MHC class I disparity, but not in the setting of class II disparity, such that it resembles acute GVHD. These results may have relevance to the human transplant setting where intercurrent CMV infection has been associated with an adverse clinical outcome.\r"

Biologic and molecular characterization demonstrated that the gene for the macrophage growth factor CSF-1 and the c-fms proto-oncogene (CSF-1 receptor) are expressed in this cell line, thus suggesting autocrine regulation as a possible mechanism for the unregulated growth of these cells. To study this possibility, we used 1) mAb, to neutralize the CSF-1 protein produced by the cell line, and 2) antisense oligomers, to inhibit CSF-1 gene products by specific base-pairing of complementary nucleic acids. We report here that both approaches inhibited in vitro cell growth by 60 to 70%, whereas the combination of oligomer and mAb inhibited proliferation by 95%. However, control antisense oligomers (50% bp mismatch with CSF-1 mRNA) did not inhibit FL-ras/myc cell growth. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of mAb and oligomers were reversible when they were removed from the media. Detection of cell-associated CSF-1 protein by immunofluorescence showed that cells treated with the antisense oligomer expressed significantly less CSF-1 protein. These results indicate that the FL-ras/myc cell line requires CSF-1 for autonomous growth and that oligomers can efficiently block production of autocrine growth factors.\r"

  ".U": "91036975\r", 
  ".W": "Previously, we reported that cholera toxin (CT) causes LPS-stimulated membrane (m)IgM+ B cells to undergo increased switch differentiation to IgG- and IgA-producing B cells. In this study we determined whether this effect is specific for one or several of the IgG subclasses and whether B cells exposed to CT respond differently to IL-4, a lymphokine with switching capabilities. In initial studies we found that in LPS-stimulated, mIgM+ B cell cultures, CT eightfold enhanced the formation of IgG1-producing B cells, whereas it only weakly enhanced, one- to twofold, the formation of IgG3-producing B cells. In addition, CT synergistically enhanced the induction of IgG1-producing B cells by IL-4, even at plateau concentrations of IL-4. In contrast, IgM and IgG3 responses were suppressed in the CT plus IL-4-containing cultures as compared to those containing only LPS or LPS and CT. Furthermore, CT plus IL-4 had no enhancing effect on the formation of cells producing IgA; on the contrary, the presence of IL-4 led to a reversal of the stimulatory effect of CT on the IgA response. In further studies, we found that CT affected B cell differentiation at the gene level, before final gene recombination has occurred. Thus, CT together with LPS induced faint but detectable germline gamma 1 RNA transcripts not seen with cells cultured in LPS alone. However, more strikingly, CT enhanced by several-fold expression of germline gamma 1 RNA transcripts in LPS-stimulated B cell cultures containing optimal IgG1-inducing concentrations of IL-4. In addition, despite its weakly positive effect on IgG3 production. CT inhibited expression of germline gamma 3 RNA transcripts in cultures containing LPS and caused a further decrease in such transcripts in cultures containing LPS and IL-4. Finally, we found that CT enhanced the in vivo IgG1 but not the IgG3 or IgM anti-DNP serum antibody response of mice immunized with DNP-LPS. Taken together, these studies suggest that CT more strongly promotes B cell differentiation to IgG1 than to any other IgG subclass in LPS-stimulated cultures. CT acts alone or in synergy with IL-4, early in B cell differentiation to promote IgG1 expression in LPS-stimulated B cell cultures, probably by inducing early steps in the switch to this isotype such as the production of germline gamma 1 RNA transcripts.\r"

PMN are also able to up-regulate rapidly the expression of CR1 and CR3 to the plasma membrane in response to agonists such as FMLP. To determine whether constitutive PMN translation was static or up-regulatable, PMN were cultured in the presence or absence of the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for 8 h. CR1, CR3 and class I proteins immunoprecipitated from lysates of 35S-methionine pulse-labeled PMN were resolved by SDS-PAGE, fluorographed and quantified by densitometry. GM-CSF-treated PMN synthesized 4.5-fold more class I protein, 3.7-fold more CR1, 2.4-fold more CD11b and 3.4-fold more CR3 beta-chain (CD18), compared with untreated control cells. Actinomycin D treatment of replicate samples of PMN decreased the amount of these proteins synthesized by each group of PMN from 30 to 90%, implying that continued translation was required for the increases in protein synthesis. Nascent CR and class I proteins were inserted into the plasma membrane of PMN, thereby supplementing the molecules already expressed on the cell surface. In addition to these longer term effects of GM-CSF, we observed its acute up-regulatory effects on PMN. GM-CSF induced a five- to 12-fold increase in the expression of CR1 and CR3 on the PMN cell surface within 30 min. These increases were both dose- and time-dependent with maximum up-regulation occurring at 25 pM and at 30 min. In contrast to the long term biosynthetic events, this rapid up-regulation was not dependent on protein synthesis but was due instead to mobilization of CR from intracellular compartments similar to those up-regulated by FMLP. These results demonstrate that PMN can respond to microenvironmental stimuli such as GM-CSF both by rapidly up-regulating and increasing translation and expression of functionally important plasma membrane proteins.\r"

As has been previously reported, neither PGE2 nor dibutyryl cAMP modulated the levels of LPS-induced IL-1 alpha mRNA. In contrast, the levels of IL-1 beta mRNA were markedly potentiated (greater than 10 fold) under the same experimental conditions. This effect was due to elevation of intracellular cAMP because other agents known to elevate cAMP levels (e.g., cholera toxin, forskolin, 1-isomethyl-3-isobutylxanthine) had the same selective effect on IL-1 beta mRNA levels. PGE2 and dBcAMP not only potentiated LPS-induced IL-1 beta mRNA levels but were also able to stimulate modest accumulation of IL-1 beta mRNA in the absence of LPS. Although measurement of IL-1 activity by bioassay suggested that dBcAMP and PGE2 could suppress LPS-induced IL-1 expression, levels of IL-1 protein, determined by radioreceptor assay, were markedly elevated. cAMP did not appreciably alter the stability of either IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta mRNA. Instead dBcAMP independently stimulated the transcriptional activity of the IL-1 beta gene. In concert the results demonstrate that cAMP can modulate the response of mononuclear phagocytes to LPS in a complex pattern; gene expression may be unaltered, suppressed, or potentiated and will thereby affect both the quality and magnitude of the ensuing inflammatory response.\r"

All three cytokines induce detectable IL-2R alpha mRNA by themselves, but there is strong synergy between IL-1 or TNF, on the one hand, and IL-2, on the other. The earliest phase of induction by IL-1 is independent of protein synthesis. IL-1, but not TNF, also stimulates transient secretion of IL-2. This leads to an autocrine stimulation of a further increase in IL-2R alpha mRNA levels. When IL-2 secretion has dropped off, continued IL-2R alpha expression requires both IL-2 and IL-1. Most or all of this regulation is due to changes in the rate of transcription of the IL-2R alpha gene. The response to IL-1 and IL-2 depends on a segment in the IL-2R alpha 5' flanking region, upstream of all cis-acting regulatory elements previously identified in the human gene.\r"

The presented experiments demonstrate that when soluble immune complexes were prepared with a mixture of antibodies containing 10 to 25% cationic antibodies, then noncationic antibodies in the complexes were deposited in mouse glomeruli. One or two cationic antibodies in each immune complex sufficed for deposition of the complexes. Proof for this was obtained by two kinds of experiments. First, the injected immune complexes were prepared in Ag excess from mixtures of radiolabeled noncationic rabbit antibodies to human serum albumin (HSA) and unlabeled cationized rabbit antibodies to HSA, thus permitting the specific quantitation of the deposition of noncationic antibodies in glomeruli because of the presence of cationized antibodies within the same complexes. As a control experiment, immune complexes prepared only with noncationic antibodies resulted in very little deposition in kidneys over the same time period. Second, detection of the localization of the noncationic antibody in deposits in glomeruli by immunofluorescence microscopy was accomplished using immune complexes prepared with mixtures of noncationic goat antibodies to HSA and cationized rabbit antibodies to HSA. Thus, the synthesis of a small population of cationic antibodies during the immune response may lead to the formation of circulating immune complexes with enhanced propensity for deposition in glomeruli in patients with SLE or other immune complex diseases.\r"

They both bound synthetic helical oligonucleotides of 10 to 20 base pairs in a gel electrophoresis retardation assay but differed in their preferences for given base sequences. Exposure of antibody-radiolabeled oligonucleotide mixtures to UV light (254 nm) for 10 min led to specific covalent cross-linking of oligonucleotide to both the H and the L chains of H241 but only to the H chain of 2C10. Single labeling events were detected without higher aggregation. The oligonucleotides were not cross-linked to unrelated IgG, even after 2 h of irradiation. Cross-linked (radioactively labeled) H and L chains of H241 and 2C10 were isolated from denaturing electrophoresis gels and digested with lysyl endopeptidase and/or staphylococcal V8 protease. H241 and 2C10 H chains each yielded a major labeled peptide fragment, but the peptides from the two antibodies were different. These experiments measured only some of the antibody-DNA interactions, probably with bases in the major groove of the DNA. They indicated that two MRL-1pr/1pr IgG anti-native DNA antibodies differ in their H and L chain contacts with DNA and provide an approach to identifying affinity-labeled binding sites in the antibodies.\r"

Activation of T cells by these toxins is dependent on MHC class II+ APC. Recent studies from a number of laboratories have implicated MHC class II proteins as the APC surface receptor for a number of the staphylococcal enterotoxins. The present report shows that staphylococcal enterotoxin A, (SEA) binds to the purified murine MHC class II molecule I-Ed reconstituted in supported planar membranes, indicating that no other cell surface proteins are required for SEA binding. The Kd for SEA binding to I-Ed was determined to be 3.5 +/- 1.6 x 10(-6) M. Specific binding of SEA to I-Ad was also observed, but the interaction was of significantly lower affinity. Binding of SEA to purified I-Ed was blocked by antibodies against both the alpha- and the beta-chain of the I-Ed molecule, but not by antibodies specific for an unrelated MHC class II protein. Binding of SEA to I-Ad was blocked by an A beta d but not by an A alpha d-specific antibody. Planar membranes containing only lipid and purified I-Ed molecules were sufficient for activation of a V beta 1 expressing T hybrid by SEA. The T cells responded to as few as 180 toxin molecules per T cell.\r"

Cells bearing C5b-8 sites suffer no deleterious effects; however, the addition of C9 results in a rapid inhibition of inner membrane function and cell death. An attempt was made to examine the relationship between the toxic effects of the C5b-9 complex and the number of C9 molecules per C5b-8 site. Cells bearing C5b-8 sites were exposed to excess C9 at 0 degrees C and washed three times at 4 degrees C. The number of C9 molecules bound to each cell was equivalent to the number of C5b-8 sites present on each cell, and no additional C9 molecules could be bound when the cells were maintained at 4 degrees C. These cells were then incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 min and returned to 0 degrees C, a technique which exposed additional C9-binding sites equivalent to the number of C9 molecules previously bound to the cells. This technique was repeated and demonstrated that the sequential build-up of a C5b-9 site with two C9 molecules per C5b-8 site was capable of inhibiting both inner membrane function (respiration and amino acid transport) and cell viability. Three C9 molecules per complex had effects that approached the inhibitory effects of complexes formed in the presence of excess C9.\r"

  ".W": "Sialophorin (CD43) is the major surface mucin on many hematopoietic cells. It has been implicated in regulating the survival of T lymphocytes in the circulation, and its functions in vitro as the receptor of a T lymphocyte and monocyte activation pathway. The structure of CD43 was examined by protease treatment of lymphoblastoid cells bearing surface CD43. Trypsin treatment converts CD43 (apparent Mr 115,000) to species of apparent Mr 100,000 called T-100, which remains cell-associated; however, the mechanism of trypsin action was not clarified. Pancreatic elastase and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease cleave CD43 at discrete extracellular sites. V8 protease generates two fragments, which together account for all properties and mass of the parent molecule. The COOH-terminal fragment V-90 (apparent Mr 90,000) consists of the intracellular and transmembrane regions and part of the extracellular region. The fragment V-30 (apparent Mr 30,000), which is released from the cell, comprises the NH2-terminal approximately 78 amino acids with attached oligosaccharides. V-30 contains the binding sites for the antibodies L2 and L10; the latter is the antibody that activates lymphocytes and monocytes. These findings subdivide the extracellular region of CD43 and indicate that the activation-inducing epitope is located in the most distal portion of the molecule. It is shown that CD43 is insensitive to all but very high concentrations of three proteases. Pretreatment with sialidase enhances sensitivity 13-fold for trypsin, 40-fold for S. aureus V8 protease, and 400-fold for elastase, suggesting that sialic acid influences the survival of surface CD43 molecules when cells are exposed to protease.\r"

From 1 ml of packed bacteria was prepared 0.25 mg of purified protein D. The apparent m.w. of protein D was estimated to 42,000 by SDS-PAGE and gel chromatography. Edman degradation cycles of protein D produced no amino acid phenylthiohydantoin derivatives and the amino-terminal end of the single protein D polypeptide chain is thus probably blocked. Protein D differs from all previously described outer membrane proteins (protein 1 to 6) of H. influenzae. Thus, protein D did not react with antibodies against protein 1 or protein 2 and the latter proteins did not bind IgD. Protein D was found to exhibit unique Ig-binding properties. Thus, in dot blots protein D bound four different human IgD myeloma proteins but not IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, or some additional proteins. On the IgD molecule, constant parts of the H chains both in the Fab and Fc fragments appear responsible for the interaction with protein D. This novel Ig-binding reagent promises to be of theoretical and practical interest in immunologic and microbiologic research.\r"

Phospholipase enzymes cleave fatty acids from membrane phospholipids, and this is thought to be the rate-limiting step in eicosanoid production. To understand better the mechanism of eicosanoid production in this disease, we stimulated human peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes with MSUC and measured phospholipase enzyme activities. MSUC stimulated both intracellular and secretory phospholipase A2 enzyme activities in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Specificity was observed, as phospholipase C activities were not affected. Pretreatment with colchicine, but not aspirin, indomethacin, allopurinol, or islet activating protein, abrogated the enhanced phospholipase A2 activities. We have recently isolated and characterized a phospholipase A2 activating protein termed PLAP from synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and from murine and bovine cell lines. PLAP was detected in gouty synovial fluid by immunodot blotting and ELISA assays and expressed the same characteristics as PLAP identified from other sources. To examine the role of PLAP in MSUC-induced phospholipase A2 stimulation, we treated cells with MSUC and observed an increase in immunoreactive PLAP. This response also could be blunted by colchicine, but not other drugs. Both phospholipase A2 and PLAP induced production by human monocytes of PGE2 and leukotriene B4 by neutrophils. These findings suggest that phospholipase A2 activation in response to MSUC requires an intact microtubule structure, and that phospholipase A2 and PLAP may be important modulators of at least a portion of the gouty inflammatory response.\r"

One of these inhibitors, PAI-1, has been directly implicated in connective tissue metabolism by virtue of its ability to bind extracellular matrix proteins. Because the normal lung is relatively rich in urokinase and abnormalities in urokinase activity have been associated with fibrotic lung diseases, we have explored the possibility of local production of PAI-1 and PAI-2 in human lung. Reverse transcription and subsequent amplification by the polymerase chain reaction of total lung RNA revealed PAI-1 mRNA in each of three normal samples and in two specimens from patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In situ hybridizations of lung biopsy specimens from a patient with ARDS with cRNA probes to PAI-1 and PAI-2 indicated that alveolar macrophages express PAI-1 mRNA during the acute injury phase. Subsequent reverse transcription and PCR amplification of normal human monocyte and alveolar macrophage mRNA revealed that neither cell type expressed mRNA for urokinase inhibitors. However, after 24 h stimulation with endotoxin in vitro, monocytes were strongly positive for PAI-2 but negative for PAI-1 mRNA whereas, under the same conditions, alveolar macrophages exhibited mRNA for both PAI-1 and PAI-2. Metabolic labeling of endotoxin-stimulated alveolar macrophages with 35S-methionine followed by immunoprecipitation with PAI-1 and PAI-2 antibodies revealed that macrophages synthesized both PAI-1 and PAI-2. As judged by immunoprecipitation and functional studies, PAI-2 was found to be the major intracellular PA inhibitor whereas PAI-1 was found to predominate outside the cell. Thus, mononuclear phagocytes exhibit a developmental potential for PAI-1 expression. The release of PAI-1 by stimulated macrophages, as observed in the setting of ARDS, may be one mechanism by which these cells promote connective tissue accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "This study documents the influence of leukotriene (LT) B4 on human B lymphocyte responses. Incubation of freshly isolated B lymphocytes with LTB4, but not LTC4, induced a slight but significant, time- and dose-dependent increase in the surface expression of Fc epsilon RII/CD23 and class II MHC Ag and in the release of soluble CD23. These changes were maximal at 10 nM LTB4 after an incubation period of 48 h. When B lymphocytes were preactivated in vitro with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC), neither LTB4 nor LTC4 was able to promote proliferation and/or IgG and IgM secretion. In contrast, when resting B lymphocytes were stimulated with a suboptimal concentration (3 U/ml) of IL-4, LTB4, but not LTC4, potentiated both the Fc epsilon RII/CD23 and the class II MHC antigen expression, and the release of soluble CD23 in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the kinetics of these responses. Furthermore, LTB4, but not LTC4, amplified both the proliferative response and the IgG and IgM secretion induced by addition of a suboptimal dose of IL-4 (3 U/ml) to SAC-preactivated B lymphocytes. Again, LTB4 did not modify the kinetics of the proliferative response promoted by IL-4. Although LTB4 potentiated IL-4-induced IgG and IgM secretion from SAC-activated B lymphocytes, no production of IgE was observed. These data indicate that LTB4 could play a regulatory role in the modulation of IL-4-induced signaling in human B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The expression and function of Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII on three mouse mast cell populations that differ in maturity as assessed by secretory granule constituents were analyzed by cellular and immunochemical approaches. As quantified by flow cytometric analysis of the binding of the rat 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma RII/III mAb, mouse serosal mast cells (SMC) purified from the peritoneal cavity expressed more receptors per cell than did mouse IL-3-dependent, bone marrow culture-derived mast cells (BMMC), which are progenitors of SMC. Coculture of BMMC with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts for 2 wk, which alters the secretory granule composition toward that of SMC, also increased receptor epitope expression to a level equivalent to that of SMC. As assessed by rosette assays with mouse mAb to SRBC, all three mast cell populations bound IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b, essentially all binding was inhibited by 2.4G2 antibody, and greater quantities of the antibody were required to block immune adherence by cocultured mast cells and SMC as compared with BMMC. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis of Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII from BMMC, cocultured mast cells, and SMC that were surface radiolabeled with Na125I revealed predominant native forms of 62, 57, and 56 kDa, respectively, and an additional surface form of 43 kDa in SMC. Removal of N-linked carbohydrate from immunoprecipitates demonstrated that BMMC expressed peptide cores of 38 kDa (Fc gamma RII-1 gene product) and 31 kDa (Fc gamma RII-2 gene product), and barely detectable amounts of a 28-kDa (Fc gamma RIII gene product) core. The expression of all three was increased by coculture with 3T3 fibroblasts, consistent with the increased expression of their common epitope by cytofluorographic analysis. SMC expressed primarily the Fc gamma RII-1 and some Fc gamma RIII gene product. Thus, the three populations of mast cells express different amounts and ratios of the Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII gene products, and maturation of BMMC during coculture with fibroblasts in vitro and in the peritoneal cavity in vivo augments cell-surface expression of the receptors and immune adherence function.\r"

MC/3T3 were presensitized with IgE anti-DNP antibodies and activated with DNP-human serum albumin. When these MC/3T3 were reactivated with the same Ag 2 and 6 h later, they released only a minimal percentage of histamine. A gradual recovery of responsiveness was detected during the first 7 days after activation, and a full recovery was attained by days 14 to 21. A similar pattern of unresponsiveness was observed when MC/3T3 were challenged and rechallenged with cercarial Ag after presensitization with anticercarial serum. Activation of MC/3T3 with one Ag (DNP-human serum albumin or cercarial) and rechallenge 3 days later with the other Ag did not overcome the state of partial unresponsiveness. Challenging MC/3T3 with anti-IgE led to a subsequent unresponsiveness to rechallenge with the same ligand, regardless of whether or not the cells were presensitized with IgE antibodies. Cross-linkage with anti-IgE resulted in a more intense and prolonged state of unresponsiveness in comparison with that observed with Ag. When MC/3T3 activated with anti-IgE were rechallenged with various IgE-independent agents they released a percentage of histamine comparable to that of control cultures challenged with these secretagogues for the first time. MC/3T3 partially resynthesized their histamine content during the two-week period after activation. Our results suggest that MC undergo a temporary state of \"physiologic\" unresponsiveness after immunologic activation in the presence of calcium ions.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported that mast cells adhere to laminin after activation with PMA. In this study, we demonstrate that the cross-linking of cell surface high-affinity IgE-R on mast cells derived from mouse bone marrow cultured for 3 wk in the presence of WEHI-3-conditioned media acts as a highly sensitive physiologic stimulus for this attachment and that receptor activation is also induced by calcium ionophore A23187. Adherence occurred at threefold log concentrations less of A23187 and Ag than required for histamine release in a selective subpopulation comprising 20 to 30% of the total cells. At higher concentrations of agonist that permitted histamine release, the time course for degranulation was shown to be more rapid than that of adherence. Adherence was inhibited by antibodies to laminin and laminin receptor and was calcium ion and temperature dependent. Treatment of cells with dibutyryl cAMP, which activates protein kinase A, inhibited both adherence and histamine release induced by Ag or calcium ionophore. Treatment of cells with staurosporin, which inhibits protein kinase C, also inhibited adherence and histamine release induced by calcium ionophore, but was not significantly active against either adherence or histamine release induced by Ag. It thus appears that agents which modulate intracellular signaling mechanisms are equally effective toward histamine release and adherence, suggesting these two events are intimately linked in stimulus secretion coupling. Specific cytokines stimulating mast cell adhesion to laminin could not be found; however, culture of mast cells with TGF-beta 1 was determined to enhance IgE-mediated adherence to laminin. Hence, the high-affinity IgE-R on the mast cell functions not only in exocytosis but also facilitates the process of mast cell adherence to laminin.\r"

Murine mast cells, in turn, express cell surface receptors for IL-3. Human rIL-3 has been shown to induce proliferation and differentiation of human basophils and to activate basophils via high affinity binding sites. To investigate whether human mast cells express IL-3R, binding studies with 125I-radiolabeled human rIL-3 were performed on HMC-1, a novel human mast cell line, and on pure populations (i.e., 93 to 99% purity) of human tissue mast cells obtained with mAb and C from dispersed lung (n = 2). Unexpectedly, neither enriched human lung mast cells nor HMC-1 cells bound radiolabeled human rIL-3 specifically. Moreover, human rIL-3 failed to promote uptake of [3H]thymidine, synthesis of histamine, histamine releasability, or changes in expression of mast cell differentiation Ag (YB5B8, CD54/ICAM-1, CD9/p24, CD33/gp67) on either human lung mast cells or HMC-1 cells. It is hypothesized that the fundamental difference in the biologic response to IL-3 between human and murine mast cells is due to a loss during evolution of mast cell high affinity IL-3 binding sites.\r"

Our results indicate that: 1) HBV-infected subjects who develop a self-limited acute hepatitis show a vigorous PBMC response to hepatitis B core Ag and HBeAg, as expression of T cell activation; 2) appearance of a detectable lymphocyte response to HBV nucleocapsid Ag is temporally associated with the clearance of HBV envelope Ag; 3) in patients with chronic HBV infection the level of T cell responsiveness to hepatitis B core Ag and to HBeAg is significantly lower than that observed during acute infection; 4) T cell sensitization to HBV envelope Ag in acute and chronic HBV infection is usually undetectable and when measurable is expressed transiently and at low levels. These results may reflect immune events of pathogenetic relevance with respect to evolution of disease and viral clearance.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was threefold: to determine if the variant surface coat glycoprotein (VSG) of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense induces IL-1 alpha; to study the kinetics of IL-1 alpha transcription, maturation and secretion; and to compare VSG to LPS in its ability to induce IL-1 alpha. VSG was added to cultures of the P388D1 murine macrophage cell line. RNA was dotted onto nitrocellulose and hybridized with a murine IL-1 alpha cDNA probe. Maximal production of IL-1 alpha mRNA occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner, peaking at 25 micrograms/ml VSG, within 2 h. Induction of IL-1 alpha was not due to contaminants because 1) absorption of VSG with a mAb abrogated IL-1 alpha mRNA synthesis, 2) the addition of polymyxin B did not affect mRNA levels, and 3) cellular IL-1 alpha was detectable in VSG-treated splenocytes from endotoxin nonresponder C3H/HeJ mice. Murine splenic macrophages also had enhanced levels of IL-1 alpha mRNA after administration of VSG in vivo or during an acute infection. Antiserum generated against the synthetic peptide SGDDSKYPV (amino acids 177-185 from the murine IL-1 alpha sequence) was used to measure the levels of the 33-, 22-, and 14-kDa proteins in cell lysates and medium of VSG-stimulated P388D1 cells. The 22-kDa protein was the predominant cellular form until secretion started. Secretion of the 14-kDa form began abruptly 6 to 8 h after the addition of VSG. By 12 h, the 33-kDa precursor was the major cytoplasmic form. In comparative analyses, LPS-stimulated P388D1 cells produced more transcript, generated peak levels of 22-kDa protein 3 h earlier, and began to secrete the 14-kDa molecule 5 h earlier. The rate of IL-1 alpha accumulation in the medium was linear between 6 and 24 h after LPS treatment, but began to drop by 8 h in VSG-treated cells. Functional (comitogenic) IL-1 activity was also detected in media from VSG-treated splenic macrophages and P388D1 cells. Activity peaked at 50 micrograms/ml and was lost if 0.2% IL-1 antisera were added to the cultures.\r"

We demonstrate here that EBV and IL-4 induced the synthesis of IgE by surface IgE-negative B cell precursors isolated by cell sorting. This result suggests that the induction of IgE by EBV and IL-4 results not merely from the expansion of a precommitted surface IgE-positive B cell population but more likely from IL-4-directed switching to IgE. At the molecular level, IL-4 and EBV induced the appearance of 2.0- and of 1.8-kilobase (kb) RNA bands, both of which hybridized with an 0.88-kb HinfI fragment spanning part of the C epsilon 1 exon and the entire C epsilon 2 exon. The 1.8-kb band but not the 2.0-kb band also hybridized with a cloned genomic 0.7-kb SmaI fragment located approximately 2 kb upstream of C epsilon. Thus, EBV and IL-4 induced germline (1.8-kb) as well as mature (2.0-kb) C epsilon transcripts. IL-4 by itself induced germ-line C epsilon transcripts but not mature C epsilon transcripts in purified normal B cells. IL-4 failed to induce IgE synthesis in established EBV B cell lines and failed to induce 2.0-kb mature C epsilon transcripts but induced 1.8-kb germ-line C epsilon transcripts. These data show that IL-4 is sufficient for the induction of C epsilon germ-line transcription. In contrast, the transcription of mature epsilon mRNA requires an additional activating signal, provided by infection with EBV. Established EBV transformation results in a dissociation between germ-line C epsilon transcription and the ability to undergo IgE switching in response to IL-4.\r"

Regulation of MHC gene expression during early development is thought to play a critical role in maternal tolerance of the fetal allograft. We have used in situ hybridization techniques to characterize the temporal and spatial pattern of expression of the beta 2 m gene in the developing mouse embryo. beta 2 m mRNA is first detected in the extra-embryonic derivatives of the early primitive streak stage embryo where it is specifically restricted to the tissues of the ectoplacental cone and chorion. Expression of the beta 2 m gene continues in these tissues during formation of the definitive placenta. beta 2 m transcripts were also detected in the tissues of the visceral yolk sac starting at 10.5 days. Comparable levels of expression were observed in both the visceral yolk sac endoderm and the extra-embryonic mesoderm. These results clearly indicate that the onset of beta 2 m gene expression is not restricted to early hemopoietic cells. In the embryo-proper, significant levels of beta 2 m mRNA were not detected until day 9.5. At this stage, we observed a strong signal over the liver rudiment. The remaining somatic tissues expressed low levels of transcripts. Similar results were obtained at later stages of development, i.e., the fetal liver was consistently the most strongly positive organ. Overall these in situ hybridization studies define the pattern of beta 2 m gene transcription and thus potential sites of surface expression of class I proteins in specific cell lineages in the early postimplantation stage embryo.\r"

These cell lines serve as model systems for the earliest events in T cell lymphoma induction, before tumor cell progression and spreading to other organs. We find that primary x-ray-induced T cell lymphoma lines have phenotypic characteristics of thymic pre-T cells and show no proliferative response to any of the IL tested nor to other hematopoietic growth factors. However, they do proliferate in response to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and to a small autocrine peptide distinct from IGF-I, which we term lymphoma growth factor. One of the earliest lesions in T cell lymphoma induction may therefore be an inhibition of differentiation at one of several specific points. In its early stages, T lymphoma cell growth may be restricted to an environment where local concentrations of specific growth factors such as IGF-I or lymphoma growth factor are sufficiently high.\r"

The i.v. and i.p. distribution of radiolabeled HA antibody 317G5 x OKT3 and of radiolabeled cultured human PBL were studied in athymic nude mice bearing solid intraperitoneal tumor established from the human colon tumor line, LS174T. Mice were injected with 125I-labeled HA antibody, 125I-labeled anti-tumor mAb, or 111In-labeled PBL, and at designated timepoints tissues were harvested and measured for radioactivity. 125I-317G5 x OKT3 localized specifically to tumor sites. Tumor radioactivity levels (percent injected dose/gram) were lower with 125I-317G5 x OKT3 HA antibody than with 125I-317G5 anti-tumor mAb, but were similar to levels reported for other anti-tumor mAb. The major difference in radioactivity levels observed between i.v. and i.p. administration of 125I-317G5 x OKT3 was an increase in hepatic radioactivity after i.v. HA antibody administration. HA antibodies produced from F(ab')2 fragments, which exhibit decreased m. w. and decreased Fc receptor-mediated binding, demonstrated improved tumor:tissue ratios as compared to intact antibody HA. 125I-317G5 F(ab')2 x OKT3 F(ab')2 antibody levels were equivalent to intact HA antibody levels in tumor, but were lower than intact HA antibody levels in the blood, bowel, and liver. Tumor:bowel ratios (20:1 at 48 h) were highest when 317G5 F(ab')2 x OKT3 F(ab')2 was injected i.p. Autoradiography confirmed that anti-tumor x anti-CD3 HA antibodies localized specifically to intraperitoneal tumor; that i.p. administered HA antibodies penetrated tumor directly; and that i.v. administered HA antibodies distributed along tumor vasculature. Cultured human PBL distributed in moderate concentrations to intraperitoneal tumor when administered i.p., but not when administered i.v. The poor localization of i.v. injected PBL to tumor may reflect species disparity in homing receptors and/or endothelial ligands, a problem which may be overcome with a syngeneic model. These results suggest that regional therapy with HA antibodies and PBL may offer advantages over systemic therapy for initial clinical trials.\r"

The use of sequential HPLC, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and reverse phase chromatography, coupled with cytotoxic assays, resulted in the isolation and separation to homogeneity of a novel protein responsible for this biologic activity. Size estimation studies based on TSK HPLC columns showed that this protein has a mass of 8 to 12 kDa. The amino acid composition analysis of the CAP-2 protein calculated from HPLC chromatograms shows that this protein contains around 108 amino acids. Subsequent gas phase sequence analysis, however, was hampered because the N terminus of this protein was blocked and therefore unsuitable for sequencing by Edman degradation. The functional studies showed that the NK lysis-resistance activity of the CAP-2 protein is mediated by interaction with and nonspecific binding to NK target cells. The lymphokine-activated killer and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and mitogen-induced proliferation is not affected. Unexpectedly, the CAP-2 protein appears to be mitogenic to its own cell line. Thus, the induction of NK lysis-resistance and the mitogenic activity showed by CAP-2 protein could contribute to the tumor growth and metastatic establishment.\r"

  ".W": "Guanine ribonucleosides, substituted at the C8 position with either a bromine or a thiol group, have recently been shown to regulate several immunologic responses. We have previously shown that 8-mercaptoguanosine (8MG) can replace the requirement for cytokines in the generation of MHC-restricted CTL. In this paper, we examined the ability of 8MG to induce MHC-nonrestricted killer cells. We found that 8MG did not induce significant lytic activity from normal resting lymphocytes. However, 8MG was able to synergize with minimal amounts of IL-2 in inducing lytic activity similar to lymphokine-activated killers (LAK) in that both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant tumor cells were killed. Both the precursors and effectors of 8MG-LAK activity were similar to NK cells and were CD4- CD8- asialo-GM1+ NK1.1+. Similar to IL-2-induced LAK, 8MG-LAK were B220+. 8MG appeared to \"stage\" these precursor lymphocytes to become more responsive to IL-2 because optimal induction of 8MG-LAK required preincubation with 8MG before the addition of IL-2. This \"staging\" appeared to be due to the release of a \"second signal\" since it was readily inhibited by cyclosporine A. Anti-IFN-alpha beta was as efficient as cyclosporine A in inhibiting 8MG-LAK generation, whereas anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-1 did not exhibit significant inhibition. These findings suggest that 8MG can be of possible utility as an IL-2-sparing agent in LAK generation from NK cells.\r"

One of the first biochemical signs of effective therapy of psoriasis is the return of the EGF/TGF alpha receptor pattern toward the primarily basilar distribution seen in normal human adult skin. Whether the abnormal expression of TGF alpha in the involved skin induces the persistent expression of EGF receptors is not known nor is the signal that causes the increased production of TGF alpha. Studies to determine what factors regulate EGF receptor expression and TGF alpha induction may yield important new insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of psoriasis.\r"

Epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation in psoriasis may be linked by those cytokines many of which are produced by both keratinocytes and leukocytes. Epidermal acanthosis and keratinocyte mitoses have been observed in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and after the intradermal injection of gamma interferon. Gamma interferon and its induced proteins have been demonstrated in active psoriatic plaques. Increased levels of the keratinocyte autocrine cytokines, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, have been detected in active plaques. The apparent overexpression of IL-6 in hyperplastic psoriatic tissue may explain features of psoriasis that link keratinocyte proliferation with immune activation and tissue inflammation. Both IL-6 and gamma interferon increased TGF-alpha expression in normal cultured keratinocytes. Cytokines produced during immune activation and other inflammatory processes may lead to epidermal hyperplasia.\r"

The concordance of psoriasis in monozygotic twins was 65-72%, whereas psoriasis in dizygotic twins was 15-30%. Determination of concordance in older twin pairs from a national twin registry in Denmark revealed nearly 90-100% heritability. In order to link psoriasis with known markers within the human genome, serologic studies have been carried out with a variety of blood group and polymorphic protein antigens. A weak association with the MNS and Lewis Blood Groups Systems (relative risk, 3.5) has been identified. Stronger associations with class I B locus and class II D locus genes (relative risk, 8-12) have also been determined by studies of the human lymphocyte-antigen system. Finally, a strong association with HLA Cw6 has been determined; this marker is thought to be in linkage disequilibrium with B and D locus genes previously associated with psoriasis. The relative risk of developing psoriasis in HLA Cw6 positive individuals is about 24. A few large kindred have been reported in the dermatology literature. These support the hypothesis of autosomal dominant inheritance with penetrance of approximately 60%. In cooperation with The National Psoriasis Foundation, we have now identified over 90 families with psoriasis in three generations. We have begun the process of ascertainment, the construction of family trees, and the collection of leukocyte DNA for linkage analysis with established restriction fragment polymorphisms (RFLP). Our initial assessment is being directed to four RFLP that span approximately 30 centiMorgans of the short arm of human chromosome 6. Although karyotyping is uncommonly done in patients because of psoriasis, we now seek evidence of translocations of chromosome 6 in association with psoriasis.\r"

The functional properties of Langerhans cells are dependent upon the microenvironment in which they reside; thus, intraepidermal Langerhans cells are under the influence of cytokines secreted by keratinocytes, whereas intranodal Langerhans cells come under the influence of lymphokines from T lymphocytes. It is speculated that a genetic lesion in psoriasis robs keratinocytes of their capacity to create an \"appropriate\" epidermal microenvironment. As a consequence, intraepidermal Langerhans cells adopt the functional program of intranodal cells. When \"uninvolved\" psoriatic skin receives a cutaneous challenge with antigen, Langerhans cells, by activating naive T cells in situ, unwittingly engender a microenvironment that is more appropriate to a lymph node. This skin becomes \"involved\" as it gradually acquires features associated with lymph nodes (such as high endothelial venules). And the derangement is further complicated by abnormalities of proliferation and differentiation among keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts as they respond to the inappropriate T-cell-derived lymphokines, giving rising to the typical, active psoriatic lesion.\r"

IL-1, in particular, can potentiate immune cellular activation, activate fibroblasts, and increase endothelial cell adhesiveness to leukocytes. Here, we review IL-1 regulation in normal and psoriatic skin in vivo in relation to normal skin and cultured keratinocytes. Contrary to expectations, IL-1 functional activity in psoriatic lesions is reduced, not increased, relative to normal skin. The reduction is attributable to the presence of IL-1 inhibitors, reduced IL-1 alpha levels, and an IL-1 beta that lacked function in T-cell assays. IL-1 beta protein is actually significantly increased in psoriatic lesions, but the mechanism of its non-functionality remains unclear. Unlike cultured keratinocytes, which accumulate large, inactive IL-1 beta precursors, both normal and psoriatic skin process IL-1 beta to a mature form. Novel mechanisms of post-translational processing by epidermis in vivo may generate a novel form of IL-1 beta with unknown functions. The marked abnormalities of IL-1 regulation in psoriatic skin suggest that this molecule may be important in normal skin homeostasis.\r"

Cytokines initiate their biologic action by interacting with target cells bearing cytokine receptors and then initiating a cascade of cellular interactions. Certain inflammatory skin diseases have been associated with overproduction of cytokines, alteration in cytokine receptors, or dysregulation of cytokines. While data is still quite preliminary, it is likely that cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory skin diseases.\r"

We have recently tested the hypothesis that the abnormal endothelial proliferation in the dermal papillae of psoriatic lesions may be mechanistically linked to the expression of endothelial ligands capable of promoting lymphocytes binding and extravasation. The results indicated that specialized endothelial cells lining the post-capillary venules of psoriatic lesions are capable of promoting the selective adherence of human CD4+ T cells and its memory subset. In contrast, B cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD45RA+ T cells are deficient in their capacities to bind. The adhesion process is energy and calcium dependent and involves tissue-specific lymphocyte receptors, with LFA-1 molecules playing an accessory role. We concluded that transformation of the dermal endothelium into a lymphocyte-receptive phenotype by defined growth factors or cytokines may represent a positive feedback mechanism promoting lymphocyte migration into the diseased sites.\r"

  ".W": "Psoriatic involved skin contains an increased number of activated T cells. The mechanism through which these T cells achieve and maintain their activated state is unknown, and both antigen-dependent and -independent mechanisms may contribute. Recently a novel pathway of antigen-independent T-cell activation has been described. This pathway is identified by a monoclonal antibody that binds to a T-cell membrane surface molecule termed \"UM4D4.\". This molecule is expressed on a minority (20%) of psoriatic peripheral blood T cells but on a majority (75%) of the T cells in lesional skin. Thus, UM4D4 could play a role in antigen-independent T-cell activation in psoriasis. Indeed the monoclonal antibody anti-UM4D4 consistently induces proliferation of psoriatic UM4D4+ T-cell clones. The activity of antigen-dependent pathways are also enhanced in psoriatic epidermis in as much as involved skin relative to uninvolved skin contains an increased number and function of antigen-presenting cells. Upon activation, the lesional T cells release lymphokines. Central to the immune hypothesis of psoriasis is that some of these T-cell lymphokines act on keratinocytes to induce changes characteristic of psoriasis. Indeed lymphokines from lesional psoriatic T-cell clones directly alter in vitro keratinocyte phenotype through induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and HLA-DR cell-surface expression. Furthermore, the lymphokines also enhance keratinocyte growth. These data suggest a critical role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.\r"

  ".U": "91037112\r", 
  ".W": "Prominent within the inflammatory infiltrate of psoriasis are HLA-DR positive T lymphocytes and factor XIIIa positive dermal dendrocytes. Many investigators studying psoriasis have assumed that the HLA-DR positive T cells are activated, and thereby capable of producing lymphokines such as gamma interferon. However, by immunohistochemical analysis, greater than 95% of the dermal T cells in psoriatic lesions are Ki-67 negative, which suggests that they are in a resting or non-cycling (Go) state. In contrast to the dermal T-cell population, the epidermal T-cell population contains a greater population of Ki-67 positive lymphocytes. The entry of the T cells into the epidermis is, therefore, apparently associated with an important activation event, which in all likelihood involves interaction with the keratinocyte. The presence of activated intraepidermal T cells has been substantiated by the ability to detect gamma interferon mRNA by polymerase chain reaction in epidermal sheets of psoriatic lesions. The pathophysiologic implication in psoriasis for these distinctions and compartmentalization involving dermal and epidermal T cells are placed into the context of a cascade of cellular trafficking events, which are further dissected into a specific network of molecular mediators of inflammation. This report suggests that more attention should be placed on the microenvironment of the skin, with specific emphasis on the mechanism by which T cells accumulate in the dermis and epidermis, and elucidation of the selective inductive and recruitment capabilities of endothelial cells, perivascular dermal dendrocytes, and keratinocytes.\r"

Retinoids can affect the proliferation of human epidermal keratinocytes either positively or negatively and influence the multi-step program of differentiation in epidermal keratinocytes at very specific stages. Epidermal keratinocytes express nuclear retinoic acid receptors, RAR alpha, and RAR gamma. It is likely that at least some of the alterations in gene expression induced by retinoids are mediated through these RAR. The cytosolic retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP), which is differentially expressed during squamous differentiation of human epidermal keratinocytes, may control the effective concentration of retinoic acid in the cell and therefore regulate indirectly gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Based on recent experience that Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive drug, produces marked improvement in psoriasis, possible immunomodulatory activities of methotrexate (MTX) have been reviewed to look for alternate mechanisms of MTX action in psoriasis. It is generally considered that the therapeutic results of MTX in psoriasis are related to a direct effect on epidermal cell hyperplasia through inhibition of DNA synthesis. Several studies in the literature now suggest possible effects of MTX on the immune system of psoriatics as well as in animal models that may have some pathogenic similarities to psoriasis. In psoriatics receiving MTX, neutrophil chemotaxis is suppressed, resulting in a possible alteration in the potential pathologic activity of neutrophils commonly found in lesional skin. MTX does improve both psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis. Animal studies of the latter using adjuvant arthritis and graft vs host disease (GVHD) have indicated several possible mechanisms for MTX that affect these processes. In GVHD, MTX selectively destroys cycling CD8+ cells, and in adjuvant arthritis the activation of macrophages is prevented by inhibition of T-cell function. While MTX generally has not been clinically utilized as an immunomodulatory drug for immunologically related diseases, it may, nonetheless, have selective actions that could be specific for some diseases. MTX and Cyclosporin A could work mechanistically in similar ways but at different steps in the activation of T cells and macrophages. It may be that the major direct effect of MTX on epidermal cell proliferation is complemented or even mediated by subtle immunoregulatory effects on the melange of cells in the affected skin and the systemic immune response.\r"

We investigated whether people who have developed basal cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin have an altered ability to repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA. Twenty-two patients with at least one basal cell carcinoma, aged 31-84 years, and 19 healthy volunteers, aged 25-61 years, took part in the study. Both groups were given one minimal erythema dose (MED) of simulated solar radiation on the lower back. DNA was extracted from the irradiated skin 0 to 6 h later, and the number of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers was determined using a dimer-specific endonuclease. At time 0, the average number of dimers per unit of DNA was similar in the two groups. After 6 h, an average of 22 +/- 4% of the dimers were removed in the group with basal cell carcinoma compared to 33 +/- 4% in the cancer-free group. In the basal cell carcinoma group, only 23% of the patients repaired more than 30% of the dimers after 6 h, compared with 53% of the cancer-free subjects (p less than 0.05). We conclude that patients who develop basal cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin may have a decreased ability to repair pyrimidine dimers induced in skin exposed to simulated solar radiation.\r"

In order to assess the pharmacologic effects of chronic topical tretinoin application used to improve the appearance of patients with photoaged skin, cutaneous biopsies from 25 patients in a controlled clinical study were examined histologically and immunocytochemically. Chronic application of tretinoin causes epidermal thickening (25 of 25 samples), stratum granulosum thickening (15 of 25), parakeratosis (13 of 25), a marked increase in the number of cell layers expressing epidermal transglutaminase (13 of 25), and focal expression of two keratins, K6 (12 of 25) and K13 (8 of 25), not normally expressed in the epidermis. The morphologic changes correlated with immunohistochemical abnormalities; neither of these correlated with the subjective cosmetic response. Three major epidermal differentiation products, keratins K1, K10, and K14 were not altered, within the limits of the methods used. Thus, chronic topical tretinoin reprograms some, but not all, aspects of human epidermal differentiation in vivo.\r"

No change in stratum corneum lipid content was observed. A sex-related difference was noted in the response to treatment under our experimental conditions, the female patients responding better. A punch biopsy (4 mm) was performed on both forearms of four patients after the 6-month period. Histologic and ultrastructural examination revealed epidermal and dermal changes evoking increased cellular metabolism in the retinoic acid-treated forearms.\r"

An equation describing a two-compartment open model with a very brief lag time and first-order uptake and elimination was used to describe the central plasma compartment kinetics. Unchanged all-trans-retinoic acid represented less than or equal to 4% of the total circulating radio-activity. Peak circulating concentrations of parent all-trans-retinoic acid were less than those observed after an equivalent oral dose, but prolonged absorption from the skin appears to contribute to high total bioavailability of topical retinoid. Topical administration to intact skin of up to three consecutive doses of 10.5 mg/kg/d all-trans-retinoic acid or a single 5 mg/kg dose of etretinate (Ro 10-9359) during a critical stage of embryogenesis in hamsters caused erythema and/or dose-dependent epidermal hyperplasia at the site of application, but failed to induce a significant teratogenic response. Topical application of 0.01-1.0 mg/kg arotinoid Ro 13-6298 resulted in dose-dependent mucocutaneous toxicity and an increase in the numbers of dead embryos and malformed offspring. The marked skin toxicity and attenuated concentrations in maternal blood, compared to the oral route, limit the amounts of retinoid that can reach the hamster embryo. It is thus more important to compare the retinoid systemic values (absorbed dose) than it is to compare the oral or topical (applied) dose, when interpreting the results of conventional teratogenicity bioassays. The data suggest that in the human it is skin toxicity that limits the amounts of retinoid that can be applied and subsequently reach the embryo. In the rodent, overt skin toxicity under continued dosing could increase the amounts of retinoid penetrating the skin and reaching the embryo.\r"

The remarkable efficacy of this drug coupled with its known immunosuppressive properties have enabled a further appreciation of the role of the immune system in the induction and maintenance of psoriatic plaques. Although acting primarily on T lymphocytes, there is also evidence for an effect of cyclosporine A on other constitutive cell types within the skin. The future use of systemically administered cyclosporine A in the treatment of psoriasis and other cutaneous diseases is dependent on the successful balance of efficacy and side-effect profile; namely, the dose-related problems of hypertension and nephrotoxicity. As a result of the toxicity encountered with systemically administered cyclosporine A, attempts to formulate a successful topical preparation for use in cutaneous disease are being made. The advent of cyclosporine A provides the dermatologist with a new therapeutic strategem in the management of psoriasis, although the long-term safety of such interventional therapy remains to be discerned.\r"

  ".W": "Normal, healthy human volunteers and patients with proved history of non-melanoma skin cancer have been tested for their capacity to develop contact hypersensitivity to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) following exposure of buttock skin to acute, low-dose ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Using a radiation protocol that achieves virtually complete depletion of normal-appearing Langerhans cells from irradiated skin, it was learned that approximately 60% of healthy volunteers developed vigorous contact hypersensitivity (CH) when 2000 micrograms DNCB was painted on the irradiated site. These individuals were designated UVB-resistant, and were distinguished from other individuals, designated UVB-susceptible, who failed to develop contact hypersensitivity following an identical treatment protocol. It was then discovered that virtually all (92%) skin cancer patients exposed to UVB and DNCB failed to develop CH, i.e., were UVB-susceptible. In subsequent experiments, epicutaneous application of 2000 micrograms DNCB to unirradiated skin of UVB-susceptible individuals revealed a further distinction between normal persons and skin cancer patients. Approximately 45% of the latter (and none of the former) remained unresponsive (failed to develop contact hypersensitivity following this second attempt at sensitization), implying that they had been rendered immunologically tolerant. These tolerant individuals responded normally to the unrelated hapten, diphencyprone. We conclude that human beings resemble inbred strains of laboratory mice in that some individuals are UVB-susceptible, whereas others are UVB-resistant. Because the incidence of UVB-susceptibility was significantly higher in skin cancer patients, and as specific unresponsiveness could be demonstrated only in these patients, we propose that UVB-susceptibility, as we define it in this hapten system, may be a risk factor for the development of skin cancer.\r"

DNA probes specific for various cutaneous and genital HPV types were used in hybridizations conducted under nonstringent or stringent conditions. HPV DNA sequences were only detected in eight specimens obtained from six patients: HPV 34 in one case of periungual Bowen's disease, HPV 36 and an as yet uncharacterized HPV in two cases of actinic keratosis, HPV 20 in one case of basal cell carcinoma, an as yet unrecognized HPV in one case of squamous cell carcinoma, and HPV 16 in one case of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip. None of the specimens of cutaneous horn and keratoacanthoma contained detectable HPV DNA. In contrast, HPV DNA sequences, mostly HPV 16, were detected in 13 of 23 cases of anogenital Bowen's disease and invasive Bowen's carcinoma. HPV DNA sequences were not detected in 90 cutaneous samples further analyzed by the polymerase chain-reaction technique, using amplification primers that contain conserved sequences among the genomes of HPV. These results strongly suggest that the known HPV types play only a minor role, if any, in skin carcinogenesis in the general population.\r"

Twelve volunteers were patch tested with 0.12, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00% SLS, and the skin response was evaluated after 24 and 48 h, respectively. We found a statistically significant linear dose-response relationship between dose of SLS and skin response evaluated by measurement of TEWL, skin color, superficial blood flow, and edema. Statistical evaluation by regression analysis proved measurement of TEWL to be the method best suited overall for quantification in relation to patch testing with SLS, whereas colorimetry was found to be the least sensitive of the applied methods. Ultrasound A-scan was found to be a promising method for quantification of the inflammatory response, being consistently more sensitive than measurement of skin color.\r"

We used organ-cultured vibrissa follicles to test whether it is minoxidil or its sulfated metabolite, minoxidil sulfate, that stimulates hair growth. Follicles from neonatal mice were cultured with or without drugs and effects were assessed by measuring incorporation of radiolabeled cysteine in hair shafts of the treated follicles. Assays of minoxidil sulfotransferase activity indicated that vibrissae follicles metabolize minoxidil to minoxidil sulfate. Dose-response studies showed that minoxidil sulfate is 14 times more potent than minoxidil in stimulating cysteine incorporation in cultured follicles. Three drugs that block production of intrafollicular minoxidil sulfate were tested for their effects on drug-induced hair growth. Diethylcarbamazine proved to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of sulfotransferase and prevented hair growth stimulation by minoxidil but not by minoxidil sulfate. Inhibiting the formation of intracellular PAPS with chlorate also blocked the action of minoxidil but not of minoxidil sulfate. Acetaminophen, a potent sulfate scavenger blocked cysteine incorporation by minoxidil. It also blocked follicular stimulation by minoxidil sulfate apparently by directly removing the sulfate from the drug. Experiments with U-51,607, a potent minoxidil analog that also forms a sulfated metabolite, showed that its activity was inhibited by both chlorate and diethylcarbamazine. These studies show that sulfation is a critical step for hair-growth effects of minoxidil and that it is the sulfated metabolite that directly affects hair follicles.\r"

An objective of our laboratory has been to establish an in vitro definition of this inherent aberration. Fibroblasts are important to epidermal proliferation/differentiation. This, and an unconfirmed report that fibroblasts from psoriatic subjects might drive the abnormal epidermal proliferation in psoriasis, have caused further focus on the fibroblast. Data show that fibroblasts from patients with psoriasis, both involved and uninvolved, in the presence of human serum, either normal or psoriatic, have an increased rate of proliferation. Fibroblasts from uninvolved psoriatic sites are most responsive. To determine if fibroblasts from psoriatics could induce the psoriasiform phenotype on normal keratinocytes, an interactive skin equivalent system has been developed. With this system, fibroblasts from uninvolved and involved sites cause normal keratinocytes to have an enhanced outgrowth. Uninvolved fibroblasts cause the greatest changes. The nature of the skin equivalent system calls for this to occur via message over distance. We conclude that fibroblasts from psoriatic subjects can induce a psoriasiform phenotype via a soluble message.\r"

In view of this similarity, it has been suggested that the epidermis may be a site of either post-thymic or extra-thymic T-cell development. In order to address this issue, we used C3H/He/Han (Thy-1.2)----AKR/Ola (Thy-1.1) radiation bone marrow chimeras. Animals were first either thymectomized or sham-thymectomized, then lethally irradiated (750R) and, finally, reconstituted with allogeneic bone marrow cells previously depleted of Thy-1-bearing cells. Six weeks after bone marrow transplantation, spleens and lymph nodes of sham-treated animals, but not of thymectomized animals, contained large numbers of CD3+ donor-type Thy-1+ cells. The epidermis of both thymectomized and sham-treated animals contained not only many recipient-type CD3+, Thy-1+ DEC, but also small numbers of CD3-, donor-type Thy-1+ cells. After 4 months, the frequency of donor cells had greatly increased, but they still lacked CD3 antigens. Most of the donor cells had a rounded shape, but some exhibited a dendritic configuration. These results demonstrate that Thy-1- bone marrow-derived precursors of Thy-1+ DEC can migrate to the epidermis without thymic influence and yet acquire Thy-1 antigens during their journey. Although donor-type Thy-1+ epidermal cells failed to mature into CD3+ dendritic epidermal cells, the experimental model used in this study may be a versatile tool for studying the influence of thymic and extrathymic epithelia on T-cell maturation.\r"

  ".W": "The production of the inflammatory mediator paf-acether (paf) from human epidermal cells was investigated in vitro. Human epidermal cells, freshly isolated from normal skin or in culture, were incubated in Tyrode's buffer containing 0.25% lipid-free bovine serum albumin in the presence of 2 microM calcium ionophore A23187, at 37 degrees C, for 1 to 60 min. Paf production slightly began at the first min of stimulation, was significant after 10 min, reached a maximum at 20 min (251 +/- 25 pg/l X 10(6) cells, mean +/- 1 SD), and decreased thereafter. About 50% of the paf amount produced by epidermal cells was recovered in supernatants. Addition of the non-acetylated paf precursor 1-O-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, i.e., lyso-paf, at 0.1 microM to epidermal cells during A23187-stimulation did not alter this production. In contrast, addition of acetyl-coenzyme A at 0.1 mM enhanced paf production by 5 times. The material produced by epidermal cells was identical to synthetic paf because: 1) the aggregation of aspirin-treated and ADP-insensitive washed rabbit platelets it induced was inhibited by BN 52021, an antagonist of the paf putative receptor; 2) the factor was inactivated by phospholipase A2 but was insensitive to lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus; 3) it exhibited the same retention time as synthetic paf during standard and reverse-phase (RP) high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) elution. The paf precursors, i.e., lyso-paf and 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, were also detected in epidermal cells, stimulated with A23187 or not. As determined by RP-HPLC analysis and confirmed by gas chromatography analysis, these precursors and the paf produced by epidermal cells exhibited more than 90% of a hexadecyl chain at the sn-1 position of the molecule. The present results demonstrate the synthesis and release of paf by normal human epidermal cells. Paf production within the epidermis might account for the development of cutaneous inflammation and the pathogenesis of many skin disorders.\r"

However, regional differences exist in topical chemical percutaneous absorption studies in man and in animal. The objective of this study was to compare epidermal thickness and number of cell layers across species and body sites using both formalin-fixed paraffin and frozen sections. Cutaneous blood flow determined by laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) was compared to histologic data. Six animals of each of the following species were used: monkeys, pigs, dogs, cats, cows, horses, rabbits, rats, and mice. Cutaneous blood flow was determined and 6-mm skin biopsies were taken directly from the following sites: buttocks, ear, humeroscapular joint, thoracolumbar junction, and abdominal area. When the two histologic methods were compared across all species and body sites, the thickness of the epidermis was significantly greater, and the thickness of the stratum corneum significantly less, in paraffin sections versus frozen sections (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the number of viable cell layers determined by both methods. The values for LDV-determined blood flow did not significantly correlate (p greater than 0.05) to epidermal or stratum corneum thickness. However, regional and species differences were noted in all these parameters. In conclusion, these data indicate that thickness and LDV blood flow are independent and must be evaluated separately when comparisons are made between species and body sites. This work provides a data base for future comparative studies in which a knowledge of skin thickness or blood flow might be important variables.\r"

  ".W": "The clonidine transdermal therapeutic system (clonidine-TTS) has been associated with a significant incidence of allergic contact sensitization. This incidence was not predicted by premarket skin sensitization testing in animals or humans. One possible explanation lies in recent findings in guinea pigs that clonidine exposure could inhibit the elicitation of skin reactions to unrelated strong contact sensitizers. However, these studies also showed that clonidine pretreatment did not appear to affect the induction of contact sensitization. On this basis, we sought to specifically evaluate the induction phase of sensitization to clonidine as an alternative means of assessing its sensitization properties. The method selected was the assay of in situ lymphocyte proliferation in lymph nodes draining the sites of clonidine exposure, a method recently promoted as an alternative means to assess contact allergenic potential. Utilizing various induction application techniques and regimens, we were consistently unable to demonstrate clonidine's allergenic potential through such an assessment of lymphocyte proliferation. We were also unable to demonstrate sensitization by in vivo ear swelling or in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis assay techniques. However, a subsequent assessment of the effect of clonidine exposure on the induction of sensitization to unrelated strong contact allergens demonstrated a consistent 40-70% inhibition of the proliferative response to the contact allergens oxazolone and trinitrochlorobenzene. This was similar to the degree of suppression produced by the corticosteroids fluocinonide and hydrocortisone when they were tested at 80 and 10 times lower concentrations. In addition, we observed a comparable inhibition of the ear swelling response to oxazolone. These data extend our knowledge of the immunomodulatory effects of clonidine and offer additional mechanistic insights into the failure of short-term predictive patch-test methods to detect this chemical's potential to induce allergic contact sensitization.\r"

It may be possible to produce mouse models of dominantly inherited keratinization disorders by targeting the expression of mutant genes encoding the major differentiation products of the epidermis, such as the differentiation specific keratins, filaggrin and cell envelope proteins. Mouse models for other skin disorders associated with abnormal regulation of growth, such as psoriasis, may be generated by targeting the overexpression of cytokines and growth factors, which are thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. The development of currently unavailable animal models for certain inherited human skin diseases would not only contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases at the molecular level, but also provide interesting models for therapeutic intervention.\r"

Subjects with severe cystic acne were immunized with suboptimal doses (10 micrograms) of KLH 7 d and 3 months after starting retinoid therapy (13-cis RA, 1 mg/kg/day for 4 mo). A standard booster immunization with TT was given along with the initial KLH sensitization. A control group of acne patients received identical immunization regimens, but no 13-cis RA. Plasma retinoid levels were evaluated by reverse-phase HPLC and confirmed that blood-level concentrations of 13-cis RA and metabolites in these acne patients reached values previously demonstrated to be immunomodulatory in vitro. The retinoid had no effect on responses to TT as reflected by the characteristics of increased anti-TT IgG levels or the isotype distribution of the antibody. In contrast, the anti-KLH response was significantly enhanced in the 13-cis-RA-treated group. Whereas anti-KLH antibody was detected in only 4 of 13 control subjects after the secondary immunization, 10 of 13 retinoid-treated subjects had measurable levels of anti-KLH IgG (p less than 0.05). Among the responders, no differences were noted in the isotype distribution of anti-KLH antibody. These results showing enhanced anti-KLH responses induced by 13-cis RA therapy represent the first demonstration in humans that in vivo administration of a retinoid can modulate antigen-specific immune responses.\r"

  ".U": "91037141\r", 
  ".W": "Cholesterol esters (CE) having fatty acids of more than 18 carbons are a prominent feature of fetal skin surface lipid (vernix caseosa), but are a minor component of adult lipid. The difference may be related to the fact that fetal sebaceous glands generally synthesize little lipid. If so, it would be expected that prepuberal children, who also have very inactive glands, would secrete CE with a large proportion of very-long-chain fatty acids. To test this conjecture, skin surface CE from young children were isolated and analyzed. Sebum was extracted from the hair of 38 children, aged six to nine. To obtain a measure of sebaceous lipogenesis, the class composition of the lipid was determined by quantitative thin-layer chromatography and the ratio of wax esters/[cholesterol + cholesterol esters] (WE/[CH + CE]) was calculated. CE were then isolated from the lipid and hydrolyzed. The freed fatty acids were converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography to determine the proportion with more than 18 carbons. FAME from five of the subjects were then separated into saturated and monounsaturated fractions and analyzed again by gas chromatography to identify chain types. Ratios of WE/[CH + CE] ranged from 0.08 to 2.8 in the subjects. The proportion of CE FAME with more than 18 carbons ranged from 15 to 72%, with the highest proportion being found in the children with the lowest WE/[CH + CE]. The saturated FAME were mostly iso- or anteiso-branched, whereas the monounsaturated FAME were mostly straight-chain extension products of 16: 1 delta 9 or 18: 1 delta 9.\r"

Because TGF-beta stimulates fibronectin expression in cultured human keratinocytes, we wished to determine whether it might also affect ECM degradation through the plasminogen activator (PA)-plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) system. Immunofluorescence of human keratinocytes using a monospecific antiserum to type 1 PAI (PAI-1) showed enhanced cellular and ECM staining when they were cultured in the presence of TGF-beta. The antiserum also identified an Mr 50,000 protein in conditioned media that was markedly enhanced by TGF-beta. A corresponding stimulation of PAI-1 mRNA was demonstrated by quantitative RNA blot analysis. Total plasminogen activating activity of conditioned medium was markedly decreased by TGF-beta. Zymography showed this to be at least partially due to decreased secreted urokinase activity. TGF-beta may play an important role in stabilizing the provisional matrix synthesized by keratinocytes in healing wounds.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of several proto-oncogenes and growth factors was analyzed in normal skin and psoriatic lesions by RNA blot hybridization. Isolation of intact RNA from frozen biopsy samples required immediate exposure to denaturants during tissue homogenization. Lipocortin II and cyclophilin transcripts were used as internal controls. These transcripts were abundant and slightly but significantly elevated in psoriatic lesions. When results were normalized according to these reference transcripts, there was no increase in the expression of c-myc, c-Ha-ras, c-erbB (EGF receptor), c-jun, or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) transcripts in psoriatic lesions, and lesional c-fos transcripts were decreased relative to normal skin. In contrast, expression of TGF-alpha mRNA transcripts were markedly increased in psoriatic lesions even after normalization. Placement of normal or psoriatic tissue in organ culture for 2 to 4 h resulted in strong induction of c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc transcripts, but not of the other genes studied. Thus, overexpression of proto-oncogenes may be more characteristic of the epidermal response to acute injury than of the steady-state hyperplasia characteristic of psoriasis. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increased TGF-alpha mRNA levels in cultured human KC at long time intervals (24-48 h). However, of various cytokines tested, only EGF and TGF-alpha induced TGF-alpha mRNA after short time intervals (2-4 h). These results as well as the selective overabundance of TGF-alpha mRNA in psoriatic lesions among various cytokines tested suggest that activation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase by TGF-alpha is important in the pathogenesis of psoriatic epidermal hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease, but information on clinical course and infecting serotypes is limited. To help develop strategies to reduce the morbidity due to invasive pneumococcal disease, episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia were identified by retrospective review of microbiology records (November 1983-November 1987) at 10 San Francisco hospitals and, for patients 20-55 years old living in San Francisco, HIV antibody status was determined by review of medical records. Pneumococcal isolates from one hospital were serotyped. Of 294 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia identified, 32 (11%) had AIDS at the time pneumococcal bacteremia was diagnosed and another 43 (15%) were HIV-infected but did not have AIDS; 12 HIV-infected patients developed AIDS after the episode of pneumococcal bacteremia. The rate of pneumococcal bacteremia in AIDS patients was estimated to be 9.4/1000 patient-years. Serotypes of 27 (82%) of 33 pneumococcal isolates from HIV-infected patients and 107 (90%) from 119 patients without known HIV infection were among the 23 serotypes included in the currently available polysaccharide vaccine. The rate of pneumococcal bacteremia is approximately 100-fold greater in AIDS patients in San Francisco than rates reported before the AIDS epidemic, but more than half the episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia in HIV-infected patients occurred in patients without AIDS. Data on pneumococcal serotypes causing invasive disease in HIV-infected patients suggest that the current pneumococcal vaccine, if effective in this population, could provide significant protection against pneumococcal disease.\r"

Children who were given vaccine containing 950 pfu with a relative antigen content of 1.0 (lot C-K472) per dose, in an earlier protocol, had an initial seroconversion rate of 87% but VZV cell-mediated immunity was diminished at 8 weeks and 1 year after immunization. At 1 year, the percentage of vaccinees with T lymphocyte proliferation to whole VZV, gpI, or IE-62 was 98%, 77%, and 83% for recipients of the 1140 pfu/1.7 relative antigen or 1145 pfu/1.6 relative antigen content vaccines compared with 43%, 40%, and 40% among those given the vaccine with 950 pfu/1.0 relative antigen content. Since the more immunogenic vaccines contained 1.5-2.0 times more viral antigen and only 20% more infectious virus, viral antigen content may affect the immunogenicity of the varicella vaccine, particularly as reflected in the cell-mediated immune response. The current vaccine preparations elicited cellular and humoral immune responses to whole VZV antigen and memory T lymphocytes specific for major viral proteins that were detectable 1 year after immunization.\r"

Vaccination appeared to be safe and induced an antibody response (WC3 neutralizing antibody) in 97% of vaccinees. Only 9 (9%) of these, however, produced antibody to human rotavirus serotypes; at least 7 of the 9 were naturally infected before vaccination. Neither the number of symptomatic episodes of rotavirus diarrhea (21 vs 25) nor the number of moderate to severe rotavirus illnesses (9 vs. 15) was significantly different in vaccine or placebo recipients, respectively, during a predominantly serotype 1 rotavirus season. A slight but significant decrease in mean symptom score was detected in vaccine recipients. Despite an overall lack of efficacy, protection could be correlated to previous rotavirus infection, high levels of WC3 neutralizing antibody, and preexisting (maternal) serotype 1 neutralizing antibody with a titer greater than or equal to 30.\r"

A monoclonal antibody (Mab 5D3) with specificity for this 80-kDa protein has also been generated and characterized. The capacity of MAb 5D3 to protect mice against the lethal effects of endotoxin was investigated. Pretreatment of CF1 mice with as little as 15 micrograms of MAb 5D3 provided virtually complete protection against a dose of endotoxin 10-fold greater than that required to kill all mice in an untreated control group using the galactosamine sensitization model. Significant protection was also afforded normal mice given MAb 5D3 relative to saline. Several lines of evidence suggest that MAb 5D3-mediated protection is due to the agonist properties of this antibody rather than a receptor blockade mechanism.\r"

Strains were heterogeneous with respect to Vero cytotoxin (VT) production and hybridization with the EHEC plasmid-specific (CVD419) probe; 26 strains produced VT1; 1 produced VT2. Twenty-four of 27 VT+ strains and 5 of 10 VT- strains hybridized with the CVD419 probe and produced enterohemolysin; these properties are characteristic of EHEC. The strains did not hybridize with the EPEC adherence factor probe, a property characteristic of some EPEC. Nevertheless, 36 strains adhered to HEp-2 cells in a localized manner and were positive by the fluorescence actin staining (FAS) test that is considered to correlate with the ability to cause attaching and effacing lesions in vivo. EPEC and EHEC cause these lesions. Although the FAS test appeared to be the most general pathogenicity test for the O26:H11 strains, it could not be used to assign strains specifically to EPEC or EHEC groups.\r"

To identify the human milk fraction responsible for this protection, pooled skimmed, deproteinated milk was passed through charcoal, whereupon lactose was separated from the oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides contained ST-protective activity; the lactose did not. The neutral, but not the acidic, fraction exhibited protective activity against ST (22% vs. 57% mortality, respectively; P less than .001). The fucosylated, but not the nonfucosylated, subfractions of the neutral fraction contained the factor protective against ST (35% vs. 50% mortality, respectively; P less than .05). An oligosaccharide isolation scheme based on different principles produced confirmatory results. The commercially available neutral fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk did not significantly protect the mice from the effects of ST. Thus, the protective factor against ST seems to be a minor neutral fucosyloligosaccharide of human milk.\r"

The inactive stereoisomer, D-PAF, was not effective in lowering plasma TNF alpha levels in LPS-treated mice. The decrease in plasma TNF alpha induced by L-PAF or alprazolam was partly reversed by indomethacin.

All protected the mice against lethal challenge with smooth E. coli WF96 LPS, E. coli and Salmonella rough mutant LPS, or free lipid A. Epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reacting with the LPS of S. minnesota Re595 or lipid A were localized in the 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) region and on lipid A. Core-reactive MAbs reacted with their homologous Re LPS and with free lipid A. One, GL11, cross-reacted with the KDO alone. MAbs GL6, GL11, L.4, L.6, and L.8 protected the actinomycin D-sensitized mice against the lethal effects of LPS from E. coli WF96, Salmonella enteritidis, E. coli J5, S. minnesota Re595, and free lipid A. The GL11 antibody was also protective when injected after LPS challenge.

Both species caused a loss in transepithelial resistance by 3-4 h, and the monolayer's integrity was completely disrupted by 6 h. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the bacteria interacted with well-defined apical microvilli and caused disruptions in the brush border, including elongation and denuding of the microvilli. The cytoplasm was also disrupted locally, with blebs protruding from the apical surface. The bacteria entered (invaded) these cells and were enclosed in membrane-bound vacuoles within the cytoplasm. By 6 h there were many bacteria within most Caco-2 cells, and these organisms caused serious cytopathic consequences. These morphologic observations correlated well with animal infection models, indicating that this in vitro system will be useful to study pathogens that interact with human intestinal epithelia.\r"

Both CSF specimens yielded nontypable beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae that were susceptible by disk tests but relatively resistant to cefuroxime (MIC, 8- to 16-fold greater than that of control isolates). To define the mechanism of resistance, the cefuroxime resistance marker was transformed to a susceptible H. influenzae recipient; inactivation and permeability of beta-lactam substrate were tested and the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) profiles were examined. Inactivation of beta-lactam substrate was not detected and reduced permeability was not found. However, reduced beta-lactam binding to PBPs 4 and 5 was observed; 18- to 27-fold more penicillin and 2.5-to 4-fold more cefuroxime was required to saturate or block 50% of the binding sites of these PBPs, respectively. Thus, reduced affinity of PBPs 4 and 5 for beta-lactam substrate appears to be the mechanism of cefuroxime resistance in this strain. The reduced affinity of these targets appears to have contributed to the bacteriologic and clinical failure in this patient.\r"

However, female sex and absence of antimicrobial use were independently associated with an increased risk of UTI. After stratification for these variables, the silver catheter reduced the incidence of UTI among women not receiving antimicrobial agents (19% for control catheter vs. 0 for silver catheter, P = .04; confidence interval for the difference in incidence, 0.4%-38%) but not in the other subgroups. Gram-positive UTI was associated with absence of antimicrobial use, the control catheter, and catheter care violations. Gram-negative and candidal UTIs were more common after 7 days of catheterization, and candidal UTI was associated with being female and antimicrobial use. These findings demonstrate that several clinical variables influenced the incidence and microbiology of catheter-associated UTI and that the silver catheter appeared to prevent UTI among women not receiving antimicrobials.\r"

After digestion with SalI and XhoI endonucleases, DNA was electrophoresed, stained, and photographed. Differences in the mobilities of 10- to 50-kb bands distinguished isolates. Reproducibility was shown by repeated preparations and animal passage. By use of a proposed notation system for describing restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, 31 epidemiologically characterized isolates from three continents revealed 24 patterns (DNA types). Three DNA types were represented by 3 isolates each and 1 DNA type by 2 isolates; 20 types were unique. Two groups of 3 isolates of the same DNA type were from Stanford University Hospital. One patient isolate from Stanford was the same DNA type as a sewage isolate from New Jersey. Another Stanford isolate was the same as a German isolate. These observations indicate widespread dispersal of some clones and restricted locales for others. Paired isolates from airway fluids of three patients had two DNA types in each.

Thirty-four sera had affinities distributed normally about a logarithmic mean of 3.2 x 10(5) l/mol, but 13 samples had undetectable affinities (less than 10(4) l/mol). Median affinities of sera from children 2-6 (1.5 x 10(5) l/mol) and 7-11 months of age (1.6 x 10(5) l/mol) were significantly greater than the median affinities of sera from infants 12-18 (1.8 x 10(4) l/mol) or greater than 18 months of age (4.2 x 10(4) l/mol). Sera from children greater than 18 months of age vaccinated with PRP conjugated to diphtheria toxoid had a median affinity of 6.1 x 10(4) l/mol, equivalent to that of the same age group vaccinated with PRP-OMP. Children vaccinated with PRP conjugate vaccines may produce antibodies of very low affinity, a finding that may have significance for protection from invasive disease.\r"

No differences in mean or distribution of serum antibody concentrations were found among young adults (either healthy or asthmatic) or among older adults (healthy or with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease). Each group included individuals with low antibody levels.

This, together with increased monocytopoiesis and the earlier demonstration of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the serum of infected mice, suggested the activity of additional cytokines. Eight weeks after infection of mice by M. lepraemurium, interleukin-3 (IL-3) activity was demonstrated in the serum (titer, 1:3200). The serum titer of IL-3 activity was maximal after 13 weeks (greater than 1:6400) and was slightly reduced after 18 weeks (1:6400). That the IL-3 activity detected in the serum of the M. lepraemurium-infected mice reflected the presence of IL-3 itself was confirmed by a neutralization assay using anti-murine IL-3 antibodies; IL-3 activity in the serum of mice 13 weeks after infection was completely abolished by the anti-IL-3 antibodies. Finally, a 1-kb signal of IL-3 RNA was detected in the spleens of M. lepraemurium-infected mice 13 weeks after infection.\r"

Such spirochetes flexed and rotated but did not progress in relatively nonviscous fluids and migrated increasingly rapidly as the viscous characteristics of the medium increased. The viscoelastic properties of various kinds of hyaluronic acid resembled those of a methylcellulose standard. The maximum velocity that spirochetes achieved in such solutions related directly to viscoelasticity rather than to chemical composition. Spirochetes remained motile during 3 h of observation despite 100-fold dilution of the standard nutrient medium. The immobility of Lyme disease spirochetes in media less viscous in character than fixed tissue suggests dissemination via the intercellular ground substance of skin.\r"

To ascertain their importance in vivo, activation fragments of the classical (C4d), alternative (Ba), and common (C3d) pathways were measured and fragment to parent molecule ratios derived in 74 HIV-infected individuals and related to circulating immune complex (CIC) levels, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage, and beta 2-microglobulin, neopterin, and CD4-positive (CD4+) lymphocyte levels. All fragments and ratios were significantly higher in patients (P less than .01) than controls. C4 conversion indices (C4d and C4d to C4) increased linearly with increasing CDC stage (P less than .001), while CD4+ lymphocytes decreased linearly (P less than .001). C4d, C3d, C4d to C4, and C3d to C3 correlated with increasing CIC and beta 2-microglobulin, and C4d and C4d to C4 correlated with decreasing CD4+ lymphocytes (P less than .05). The relationship of classical complement pathway activation to disease progression and CD4+ lymphocytes suggests its involvement in the pathogenesis of HIV infection.\r"

The effects of the drugs were studied on both acutely and persistently infected CD4+ cell lines. The three agents, azidothymidine (AZT), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and an anti-HIV envelope antibody coupled to ricin A chain, were tested alone and in combination. AZT was found to have its greatest effect during early stages of the infection, but also had an action on persistently infected T cell lines. The effect of AZT on persistently infected cells was seen within 24 h, increased with extended exposure to the drug, and persisted after its removal. IFN-alpha had variable effects on acutely infected cells but suppressed chronic infection. Combinations of the therapeutic agents were studied. Using a model that allowed for treatment during both acute and persistent stages of infection, the most effective combination in suppressing HIV infection was the continual use of both AZT and IFN-alpha at the highest tolerable doses. Knowledge of the efficacy of AZT on persistently infected cells will allow for the most effective design of clinical protocols.\r"

While both T helper lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages can be infected via cell-surface CD4 in vitro, previous studies showed that few blood cells express HIV RNA in vivo. This study used DNA amplification to determine the levels of HIV DNA in purified lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils from HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals and persons with AIDS. The average numbers of HIV DNA copies in lymphocytes from AIDS patients and asymptomatic individuals were similar (approximately 100-140 copies/150,000 cells). However, when expressed on the basis of numbers of CD4+ T cells, AIDS patients' cells contained approximately 2.5 times more HIV DNA. While HIV DNA was present in lymphocytes from all 27 subjects, little or no HIV DNA was observed in monocytes or neutrophils. Only 1 asymptomatic person contained levels of HIV DNA in monocytes (125 proviral copies/150,000 cells) that were comparable to levels expressed in lymphocytes (160/150,000). While expression of monocyte HIV DNA in this person was persistent over at least 8 months, it was not observed in neutrophils, suggesting that monocyte HIV DNA did not originate in myeloid precursors. This study shows that in AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection, lymphocytes are the predominant infected cell found in blood.\r"

A white matter aberration was detected most frequently in patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) or AIDS, but also in asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive persons and in HIV-1 seronegative homosexual men, of whom two of three tested were reactive for HIV-1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction. The aberration was not found in the control group. Brain atrophy was mainly confined to patients with ARC or AIDS. The brain lesions correlated with the presence of HIV-1 in cerebrospinal fluid and with elevated levels of beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin. The most pronounced brain aberrations were in patients with AIDS-dementia complex. These findings indicate that brain aberrations may occur in persons in the early stages of HIV-1 infection, although to no greater extent than in HIV-1 seronegative homosexual men. The occurrence of pronounced brain lesions seems to be associated with the presence of an advanced immunodeficiency.\r"

Studies were initiated with brain endothelial cells, the likely portal of entry for virus into the central nervous system. Primary explant cultures of brain endothelial cells, derived from homogenates of healthy human brain, supported complete viral gene expression and cytopathic effect (CPE). Endothelial cells do not appear to be a barrier for HCMV passage into the central nervous system. Astroglial lines (primary explant or tumor-derived) varied in their ability to support HCMV replication. Some (T98G) supported incomplete (immediate-early) gene expression while others (A-172) did not support any detectable gene expression. Some astroglial lines (HS-683) supported extensive virus replication with minimal viral CPE. Neuronal cell lines (SK-N-MC) were fully permissive. The more differentiated glial lines (astrocytoma) were fully permissive to HCMV infection; however, the less differentiated glial lines (glioblastoma) were partly or nonpermissive.\r"

The precise locations of the corresponding epitopes were identified by the reactivity of MAbs and selected polyclonal antibodies with synthetic, overlapping, hexameric peptides corresponding with 95% of the BPV-1 major capsid protein. The topography of these epitopes was determined by reactivity of antibodies with intact (conformational and nonconformational surface epitopes) and disrupted (external or internal nonconformational epitopes) BPV-1 virions. The distribution of epitopes in various papillomaviruses of 13 different species was determined by reactivity of the MAbs and polyclonal sera with productively infected, formalin-fixed papillomas, fibropapillomas, and fibromas. Epitope scanning, using MAbs and polyclonal antisera, resulted in the precise location of BPV-1 hexameric epitopes that could be correlated with their topography on the capsid and distribution in papillomatous lesions of various species.\r"

Rates of lesion resolution were higher among women than among men, and women were more likely than men to respond to interferon. Virologic measurements in paired lesion biopsies did not correlate with interferon treatment or disease outcome. Although interferon toxicity was observed frequently, no participant withdrew from the study because of side effects, and dosage alterations were not required. Parenterally administered interferon-alpha is more effective than placebo in treating condyloma acuminatum, although rates of complete response are low. Different regimens, including combination therapy, should be evaluated for treatment of this common sexually transmitted disease.\r"

Fifty-six volunteers were successfully infected and shed virus on at least 4 days after challenge. Virus shedding, antibody levels, clinical symptoms and signs, and blood leukocyte levels were carefully monitored. Use of aspirin and acetaminophen was associated with suppression of serum neutralizing antibody response (P less than .05 vs. placebo) and increased nasal symptoms and signs (P less than .05 vs. placebo). A concomitant rise in circulating monocytes suggested that the suppression of antibody response may be mediated through drug effects on monocytes and/or mononuclear phagocytes. There were no significant differences in viral shedding among the four groups, but a trend toward longer duration of virus shedding was observed in the aspirin and acetaminophen groups.\r"

Three patterns of yearly outbreaks existed: (1) strong predominance of group A strains (9 years with 83%-100% A strains), (2) relatively equal proportions of group A and B strains (4 years), and (3) strong predominance of group B strains (78%-85%) in 2 years, separated by a decade. The first pattern of highly dominant A strains occurred in cycles of 1 or 2 consecutive years with a single intervening year in which B strains were greater than or equal to 40% of the isolates. Subgroups A1 and A2 predominated, while B2, 3, and 4 occurred almost equally. A greater clinical severity for Group A strains was suggested by children with group A infections requiring intensive care significantly more often (15.4 vs. 8.3%, P = .008). Further, strongly dominant A strain years were associated with higher proportions of RSV admissions requiring intensive care (16.6% vs. 5.5%, P less than .01). Strains of subgroups A2 and B4 were more frequently found in hospitalized patients and A1 in outpatients, and the 2 years with the highest rates of intensive care admissions were those in which subgroup A2 dominated.\r"

Nearly 100% of individuals formed serum neutralizing antibodies. The highest geometric mean titer (GMT) of antibody to polioviruses 1, 2, and 3 occurred in groups IPV-IPV-OPV, IPV-OPV-OPV, and IPV-IPV-IPV, respectively. Local neutralizing and IgA antibody responses were detected in 41%-88% and 75%-100%, respectively. Peak GMT of nasopharyngeal antibodies differed minimally between immunization groups. The data suggest that incorporation of at least one dose of IPV at the start of the immunization schedule tends to increase systemic as well as local antibody production.\r"

Therefore, the effects of both WC3 and natural rotavirus strains as either primary or boosting immunogens on serotype-specific neutralizing antibody responses could be determined. After primary natural infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic), neutralizing antibody titers were highest to serotype 1 but were consistently high to serotype 3, and low titers (greater than or equal to 20) to serotypes 2 and 4 were often detected. Previous vaccination with WC3 had little effect on the magnitude of these responses. In contrast, subjects infected with serotype 1 strains before vaccination experienced large (average, 12-fold) rises in neutralizing antibody to human serotypes 1-4 when vaccinated with WC3. Thus, although WC3 and the natural strains are distinct serotypes, their epitopes were sufficiently similar that reinfection with WC3 could boost neutralizing antibody titers to human serotypes in subjects primed by a previous natural infection.\r"

Although the infection is lethal by day 13-19, guinea pigs of approximately 600 g do not show edema or effusions. This raises the questions of whether capillary damage is present in such infected animals and, if it is, why edema is absent. The effects of Pichinide virus on protein transport across jejunal capillaries were examined in 38 normal and 7 infected strain 13 guinea pigs 12 days after inoculation. The latter lost 20.3% body weight but maintained normal blood pressure, serum protein concentration, and jejunal lymph flow. However, their protein solvent drag reflection coefficient (sigma) was reduced to .52 +/- .03 (mean +/- SE) from .73 +/- .02 (2P less than .001), while permeability-surface area product was not changed. In the absence of gross edema or effusions, Pichinde virus-infected guinea pigs demonstrated a leaky gut capillary wall to protein compatible with an increase in pore size or large pore number less than sufficient to change permeability-surface area product. Compensatory mechanisms that prevent edema at this stage are efficient and may include reduced capillary pressure or some degree of capillary flow stasis.\r"

At least one isolate from each patient was resistant to tetracycline at concentrations greater than or equal to micrograms/ml, although less than 1% of a population of organisms showed high-level resistance. Fully resistant populations selected by passage through 8 micrograms/ml tetracycline either died or lost their resistance on further passage in antibiotic-free medium. Relatively large inocula were required to demonstrate resistance, and morphology of inclusions was altered at high tetracycline concentrations. The observed resistance may be a new characteristic of the organism or merely newly recognized. Isolates resistant to tetracycline were resistant to doxycycline, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin but sensitive to rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin. Thus, resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin occurs in C. trachomatis and may be a factor in some treatment failures.\r"

Rates of H. influenzae meningitis varied significantly by region, from 1.9/100,000 in New Jersey to 4.0/100,000 in Washington state. The overall case fatality rates for meningitis were lower than those reported in several studies from the early 1970s, suggesting that improvements in early detection and antibiotic treatment may have occurred since that time. Concurrent surveillance was also performed for all invasive disease due to the five most common causes of bacterial meningitis. Serotypes of group B streptococcus other than type III caused more than half of neonatal group B streptococcal disease and mortality, suggesting that an optimal vaccine preparation must be multivalent. Of the organisms evaluated, group B streptococcus was the second most common cause of invasive disease in persons greater than 5 years old.\r"

Sanitation in the campsite was poor, allowing widespread transmission of disease, probably by food, water, and person-to-person spread. The attack rate may have been greater than 50% among the estimated 12,700 attendees. The outbreak was caused by Shigella sonnei, resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; the organism was of colicin type 9 and contained a 90-kilobase plasmid not found in non-outbreak-related strains. The dispersal of the group resulted in nationwide dissemination of the organism, and outbreaks in three states were linked to transmission from attendees at the Gathering. This outbreak demonstrates the potential for rapid dissemination of disease in such a setting and the necessity for careful planning of mass gatherings.\r"

Concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin bound THP in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas pokeweed mitogen and Vicia villosa B4 isolectin did not. Addition of mannose and N-acetylglucosamine reduced adherence of THP to concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin by 50%-80%. Sugar inhibition studies suggested that the fimbrial receptor site for THP has lectin-like properties and that THP binds to fimbriae via its mannose side chains.

The proportion of patients becoming infected by time was significantly greater in the visceral leishmaniasis group than in controls (P less than .01). The skin, respiratory tract, and middle ear were the most common sites of infection, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common agents. Low-grade-virulence bacteria (e.g., Serratia and Providencia species) were also isolated from some cases. Bacterial infections (mainly nosocomial) in patients with visceral leishmaniasis tend to be severe and can cause death.

Serum specimens were screened for antibodies to HTLV and to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by enzyme immunoassay; successive testing of specimens with positive results was done by Western blotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) and then by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Of 1290 specimens, only 4 had antibodies against HTLV confirmed by RIPA. PCR analysis of DNA from PBMC from two subjects showed one to be HTLV-I and the other to be HTLV-II; both men also had HIV antibodies. These results demonstrate a lower seroprevalence rate for HTLV than some previous studies and emphasize the need for specific confirmatory tests.\r"

  ".W": "A central anomaly in the pathogenesis of AIDS is that few actively infected CD4+ cells (1 in 10(4)-10(5) have been detected in the peripheral blood, even though dramatic depletion (often greater than 90%) of CD4+ cells is the hallmark of disease progression. A sensitive, 35S-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA in situ hybridization technique was coupled with a new detection method, confocal laser scanning microscopy, to examine transcriptionally active HIV-infected cells from individuals at different disease stages. In 35 symptomatic HIV-infected individuals (AIDS and AIDS related complex), an average of 1 in 350 mononuclear cells produced HIV RNA. In contrast, in an asymptomatic group of 30 individuals, an average of 1 in 2000 mononuclear cells produced HIV RNA. These data, obtained using this improved detection method, suggest there are more HIV RNA-producing cells in HIV-infected individuals than previously reported. In addition, increased numbers of HIV transcribing cells were found to correlate with declining clinical condition as assessed by Karnofsky performance score. These data suggest that viremia per se may account for the pathologic consequences in HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "As part of a phase 1 trial of a candidate AIDS vaccine, blood specimens were collected from 168 healthy adult volunteers at minimal or no risk for becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These specimens were screened for evidence of HIV-1 infection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and the Biotech/Du Pont Western blot (n = 168), culture (n = 122), and polymerase chain reaction assay (n = 20). None of the subjects had a positive test result by any of these assays, but 32% had indeterminate Western blot tests, most of which demonstrated a single band of low intensity. The most common bands were p24 (47%), p55 (34%), and p66 (36%); envelope bands were unusual (gp41, 2%; gp120, 2%). No serum specimen collected after 2-11 months from individuals with indeterminate Western blot results was positive by EIA or Western blot. There was 91% agreement in the test results of the first and second serum samples when the same lot of Western blot kit was used but only 36% agreement when different lots were used. The Biotech/Du Pont Western blot kit thus frequently yields indeterminate test results in the absence of HIV-1 infection, the reproducibility of which is subject to lot-to-lot variability.\r"

Although her mother, grandmother, and 8-month-old sister suffered from respiratory illness during these periods, TWAR was not isolated from them.

Over 8 months, 51 patients received selective decontamination and 56 received sucralfate. The selective decontamination regimen included polymyxin, gentamicin, and nystatin given as an oral paste and as a solution; patients also received standard antacid or histamine2 blocker stress ulcer prophylaxis. Patients in the selective decontamination group had significantly less colonization of the oropharynx and stomach by gram-negative bacilli (12% vs. 55%, P less than .001), significantly fewer infections due to gram-negative bacilli (6% vs. 20%, P = .02), and fewer infections overall (12% vs. 27%, P = .04). There was one episode of pneumonia in the selective decontamination group and five in the sucralfate group. Mortality and length of stay did not differ between the groups, but those receiving selective decontamination had less than one-third as many days of systemic antibiotic therapy with no increase in colonization or infection with resistant gram-negative bacilli. Thus, selective decontamination appeared to reduce both extrapulmonary and pulmonary infections.\r"

Cloned aroA+ genes did not restore wild-type virulence to SL3261, however, in a murine typhoid model. The delta aroA554 mutation was transduced into S. typhimurium strain SR-11, a mouse-virulent strain recently passaged in mice. The SR-11 delta aroA554 mutant was highly attenuated for mice challenged parenterally. The same cloned aroA+ genes isolated in SL3261 restored the virulence of the SR-11 delta aroA554 mutant to that of wild-type SR-11. These results suggest that while the delta aroA554 allele remains effective in reducing S. typhimurium virulence, laboratory passage of attenuated vaccine strains may lead to the accumulation of additional attenuating defects.\r"

Rates of S. aureus nasal carriage were 29.3% in premenopausal women and 21.9% in postmenopausal women (P not significant). Carriage rates were significantly higher (P = .026, chi 2 7.32) for women with high KIs (40.7%) than for those with intermediate and low KIs (27.03% and 25.1%, respectively). S. aureus nasal carriage also correlated independently and significantly with previous antibiotic use and the presence of insulin-treated diabetes mellitus. This preliminary observation confirms an association between levels of sex hormones as reflected by the KI and S. aureus nasal carriage rates.\r"

Viability of larval tissue at necropsy of each animal was tested by inoculation into two noninfected jirds. Albendazole-medicated feed (0.05%-0.10%) significantly inhibited larval growth. Other effects of the drug included larval degeneration and necrosis, inhibition of protoscolex formation, decreased pulmonary metastases, and reduced mortality of hosts. Adverse effects on the parasite correlated significantly with serum albendazole metabolite levels and duration of therapy. However, serum albendazole levels in jirds equal to or exceeding concentrations achieved in humans receiving daily doses of 10 mg/kg of body weight did not kill the parasite.\r"

Albendazole and mebendazole were 30- to 50-fold more active than metronidazole and 4- to 40-fold more active than quinacrine. Thiabendazole, a noncarbamate benzimidazole, was less active. Since lack of intestinal absorption makes mebendazole an attractive new antigiardial agent, its in vitro activity was further characterized. At low concentrations (0.05 micrograms/ml) mebendazole had a static effect on G. lamblia growth; however, lethal activity was observed at a concentration fivefold lower (0.3 micrograms/ml) than necessary for the cidal agent metronidazole. Two observations are consistent with a microtubule target for mebendazole. First, attachment of cells to the culture tube, mediated by the ventral disk and flagella, was rapidly disrupted by mebendazole treatment. Second, the characteristic cell structure was grossly distorted by treatment. No mebendazole-resistant G. lamblia were detected in a population of 10(8) cells.\r"

  ".U": "91037628\r", 
  ".W": "Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were evaluated for their ability to modulate platelet response induced by collagen, thrombin, platelet-activating factor and the stable analog of cyclic endoperoxides U46619. Platelet aggregation was first evaluated in whole blood and in leukocyte-depleted whole blood by the impedance method. This novel approach highlighted the inhibitory role of leukocytes on platelet aggregation in whole blood. The inhibitory role of PMNs on platelet function was subsequently evaluated on washed cells. PMN inhibition of platelet aggregation and beta-thromboglobulin release was more evident with threshold concentrations of stimuli. The inhibition also depended on the number of PMNs incubated in mixed cellular suspensions. Higher concentrations of stimuli may overcome the PMN-dependent inhibition. Under this condition, preincubation of cells with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (a specific PMN agonist) restored the inhibitory effect of PMNs on platelet aggregation in whole blood and in mixed cellular suspensions. Not only PMNs, but also PMN-derived supernatants, dose-dependently inhibited U46619-induced platelet aggregation, suggesting that the inhibition observed may be exerted by chemically stable compound(s). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ movement was measured in aequorin-loaded platelets exposed to thrombin or U46619 to see whether cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels were affected by PMN. Ca2+ levels were similar in the presence or absence of PMNs, suggesting that inhibition may be related to a subsequent platelet response step. A series of bioassay experiments showed that PMNs were able to remove and/or convert adenosine diphosphate available for platelet aggregation but not to reduce U46619 availability. Our findings suggest that (1) unstimulated PMNs may release factor(s) that inhibit platelet aggregation and beta-thromboglobulin release; (2) this in itself is sufficient to block the platelet response to a threshold concentration of stimuli; (3) release of the same or other inhibitory mediators from stimulated PMNs may have to be greater to inhibit platelet response to higher concentrations of stimuli. Data presented here suggest that adenosine diphosphatase activity and chemically stable, as yet unidentified, compounds besides previously well-characterized labile compounds such as nitric oxide and arachidonic acid metabolites are responsible for the PMN-dependent mechanism of inhibition of platelet response that could be relevant in physiopathologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Reports of subnormal serum ferritin values for elite athletes are widespread. Human studies evaluating performance in the ferritin-depleted state have led to a questioning of the significance of low ferritin levels for athletic performance. However, the accelerated iron metabolism and subnormal iron intake-uptake demonstrated by some athletes suggests that a point occurs in training at which the body must draw on its reserves. In consideration of this problem, serum ferritin, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum Fe, and total iron-binding capacity levels were measured in elite Canadian female synchronized swimmers (n = 9), male speed swimmers (n = 7), and male and female speed skaters (n = 6, n = 6) over the course of two seasons of training and competition. Training sessions were monitored to document the workload carried out by each athlete. The midseason serum ferritin team values for the first and second years (mean +/- SEM) were as follows: synchro 48 +/- 10 micrograms.1 L, 24 +/- 6 micrograms.1 L; female speed skaters 57 +/- 14 micrograms.1 L, 51 +/- 7 micrograms.1 L; male speed skaters 94 +/- 27 micrograms.1 L, 72 +/- 19 micrograms.1 L; and male swimmers 66 +/- 13 micrograms.1 L, 56 +/- 7 micrograms.1 L. A significant decrease was seen in both serum ferritin and hemoglobin for the synchronized swimmers and in serum ferritin for the male speed skaters (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that a tendency exists for a decrease in serum ferritin levels from season to season.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The putative involvement of reactive oxygen species in the etiology of lung damage in infants receiving mechanical ventilation has been examined by comparing the levels of peroxidation and expression of the antioxidant enzymes, CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase, in lungs from control and affected infants as well as from fetuses and infants who died postnatally after term delivery. Mean levels (+/- SD) of lung peroxidation, determined with a thiobarbituric acid method, were similar in affected and control premature neonates and in fetal subjects (1.87 +/- 1.26, 1.92 +/- 2.07, and 1.19 +/- 1.36 nmol/mg protein, respectively). Expression of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutases was also similar in these subjects and in the patients who died postnatally. Thus activity measurements and immunoblotting studies showed continuous expression of these enzymes throughout development with no apparent change in protein levels or size. Immunohistochemical examination of lung tissue showed expression of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutases in epithelial, smooth muscle, endothelial, and some mesenchyme components. In patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, alveolar walls were thickened by an excess of fibrous tissue and terminal air spaces were lined mainly by type II pneumatocytes. All structures, including abnormal fibrous components, were positive for both CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase. Our data show that, unlike some experimental animals, expression of at least these antioxidant enzymes in human infants born prematurely is similar to that in adults, and indicate that such infants are better adapted for life in an oxygen-containing environment than previously suspected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neutrophil GSH content was 12.3 +/- 2.5 (mean +/- SD) nmol/10(7) cells, and transferase activity of cytosol preparations was 0.187 +/- 0.035 nmol/min/mg protein with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as substrate. Maximal activity was found at a pH of 7.0 and a temperature of 40 degrees C. Apparent Km of transferase was 1.25 +/- 0.18 mmol/L CDNB, and apparent Vmax was 0.621 +/- 0.22 nmol/min/mg. GSH-CDNB conjugate was quantitated by HPLC in cells and in medium after CDNB exposure. Transport of conjugate from cells to medium increased with CDNB concentration to 50 mumol/L, and kinetic data showed two saturable transport mechanisms with apparent Km of 5.90 mumol/L and 0.265 mumol/L, respectively. Cellular GSH content fell rapidly with CDNB concentration greater than 2.5 mumol/L, and was depleted in a 10-minute incubation at a concentration of greater than 50 mumol/L CDNB. Neutrophils have a significant content of GSH and a significant amount of transferase activity, and transport of GSH conjugate involves two distinct saturable pathways. GSH depletion can be accomplished with a relatively low concentration of an exogenous chemical and could impair the ability of the cells to carry out their phagocytic functions.\r"

  ".U": "91037632\r", 
  ".W": "The origins of conjugated catecholamines remain poorly known. The aim of the present study was to see whether a major contribution comes from the sympathetic nervous system. We have assumed some kind of parallelism between the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, the amount of catecholamines released and taken up, and the amount of conjugated catecholamines circulating in plasma. Accordingly, an increase in sympathetic activity should be followed by an increase in the plasma level of conjugated catecholamines. The plasma levels of sulfoconjugated and glucuroconjugated catecholamines were measured in 10 patients with mental disease resistant to drug treatment, before and after electroconvulsive therapy. As expected, blood pressure, norepinephrine concentration, and epinephrine concentration in plasma were transiently increased. Neither sulfoconjugated nor glucuroconjugated catecholamines were significantly changed. Conjugated catecholamines were measured in 10 volunteers before and at the nadir of insulin-induced hypoglycemia. As expected, plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were drastically increased. Plasma levels of sulfoconjugates were decreased and glucuroconjugates increased; these were narrow but statistically significant variations. Data reported in the present article do not support a major role for the activity of the sympathetic system in fixing the level of conjugated catecholamines in human plasma. This is a negative, but nonetheless important, observation. In human subjects, currently available information suggests an important role for the intestinal wall and renal function in determining the level of circulating sulfoconjugates.\r"

  ".W": "Protein adsorption to surfaces occurs whenever blood comes into contact with biomaterials, prosthetic devices, and artificial organs. The plasma protein Hageman factor (factor XII) present at the interface between blood and foreign surfaces can be qualitatively and quantitatively detected after in vitro perfusion of anticoagulated human blood through important biomedical polymers. We have determined protein adsorption by a modified radioimmunoassay and by scanning electron microscopy using immunogold labeling techniques. The materials used included vascular graft materials (Dacron and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-Devices and Technology Branch reference materials polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene, and silicone rubber. Factor VIII-von Willebrand factor, another trace plasma protein, and other plasma proteins such as fibrinogen, immunoglobulin G, albumin, fibronectin, and hemoglobin were also detected at the blood-contacting surface. At physiologic flow rates, the adsorption of these proteins from the circulating blood to the surface of these materials appears to be a function of time, with certain materials, as well as of the physical and chemical characteristics of the material surface. Hageman factor adsorption to surfaces, quantified under static conditions, occurs at nanogram concentrations. These data suggest that trace proteins, such as those important in the activation of the coagulation cascade, can significantly affect the blood compatibility or thrombogenicity of an implanted device.\r"

In vitro susceptibility measurements demonstrated that all six isolates were sensitive to LY 146032 and vancomycin and that five of six isolates were sensitive to tiecoplanin, cefamandole, ampicillin plus sulbactam, and cefoperazone plus sulbactam. Comparison of antimicrobial therapy in an in vivo rabbit model demonstrated that cefoperazone plus sulbactam was active against the greatest number of isolates (five of six) based on a reduction of greater than or equal to 5.0 log10 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) from growth control at the end of the animal treatment study. Vancomycin and oxacillin were equal in achieving reductions of greater than or equal to 5.0 log10 CFU/ml in four of the six isolates. Comparing each isolate's in vivo outcome to in vitro data shows that in vitro susceptibility tests overpredict the sensitivity of these six isolates to LY 146032 and vancomycin, are variable for teicoplanin, cefamandole, ampicillin plus sulbactam, and cefoperazone plus sulbactam, and underpredict for oxacillin.\r"
