  ".W": "To determine the part played by screening in detecting visual defects questionnaires were sent to 240 families with blind or partially sighted children identified from the Family Fund's database. Questions were asked on social and family background, the visual disorder and its severity, any other disability, and how and when the disabilities were discovered and subsequently managed. Data from 189 families were analysed, constituting all those with children with major visual defects from the 219 families who replied. The visual defect was first discovered in 111 children by parents, friends, and neighbours, and in 36 by a doctor at the neonatal examination. In only three children who did not have a family history of visual impairment was the defect discovered during a formal screening examination at a child health clinic. Dissatisfaction about medical services was expressed by about a third of the parents, particularly a lack of provision of information and consideration of their worries and a failure to refer the child promptly to educational and treatment services. Visual defects in children under 5 are generally detected by family and friends, not by screening, but detection by the medical profession could be improved by increased awareness and observation and quick referral.\r"

Patients were asked to describe the process and outcome of their out of hours call, to comment on specific aspects of the consultation, and to access their overall satisfaction with the encounter. Parents seeking consultations for children were least satisfied with the consultation; those aged over 60 responded most positively. Visits from general practitioners were more acceptable than visits from deputising doctors for patients aged under 60, but for patients aged over 60 visits from general practitioners and deputising doctors were equally acceptable. Monitoring of patients' views of out of hours consultations is feasible, and the findings of this study suggest that practices should regularly review the organisation of their out of hours care and discuss strategies for minimising conflict in out of hours calls--particularly those concerning children.\r"

Although all the patients interviewed were fully aware that they had had an operation, 27 did not know which organ was operated on and 44 were unaware of the exact nature of the surgical procedure. A significantly higher age group was observed in the group of patients who were unaware of the basic facts relating to their operation, and the problem was encountered most commonly in patients over the age of 60. Because of the medical and legal importance the findings of this pilot study warrant further large scale investigations.\r"

These findings have been confirmed on a burn injury rabbit model. As we have suggested a pivotal role for an exaggerated initial (less than 36-48 h) neutrophil stimulation leading to a later (greater than 72 h) immuno-depression and anergy, we tried to modulate the early phase by drug therapy. A Ginkgo biloba extract (IPS200) injected i.v. in burned rabbits greatly reduced O2.- and LTB4 generation on A23187 challenge. IPS200 includes flavonoids and other polyphenols, inhibiting either arachidonic acid metabolism or PAF receptors, and may thus exert their modulating effect on PMN function in thermal injury.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the constancy of hemodynamic and antianginal effects of the constant infusion of intravenous nitroglycerin (NTG) and their relationship to infusion rate and plasma NTG concentration, we administered maximal tolerated doses of intravenous NTG (range 10 to 120 micrograms/min, mean = 52 +/- 33 micrograms/min) and placebo to 10 patients with chronic stable angina for 25 hr each in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Sublingual NTG (0.4 mg) was given at 24.5 hr of infusion as a positive control. Bicycle exercise time (NIH protocol), blood pressure, heart rate, exercise ST response, and venous plasma NTG were determined before and at 1, 4, 8, 24, and 24.5 hr. Plasma NTG was linearly related to infusion rate, reached a steady state within 15 min and was unchanged over 24 hr (mean = 5.5 +/- 1.2 ng/ml). Mean plasma NTG clearance was 9.3 liters/min. However, during dose titration, patients demonstrated different relationships between plasma NTG and hemodynamic effects, with widely varying slopes and intercepts. Intravenous NTG produced a sustained reduction in blood pressure and a rise in heart rate at rest, and a reduction in blood pressure during submaximal exercise at as late as 24 hr, associated with reduced submaximal ST segment abnormality. In contrast, exercise tolerance to onset of angina showed a marked initial increase on intravenous NTG but fell progressively and did not differ from that with placebo at 24 hr. Increased exercise tolerance was associated with an increase in maximal heart rate and double product (heart rate X blood pressure), suggesting that direct coronary vasodilation and/or reduced left ventricular volume were the principal determinants of increased exercise tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite a dramatic fall in renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate is usually preserved in patients with congestive heart failure until the terminal stages of the disease. This maintenance of renal function appears to be achieved in part by the synthesis of two vasoactive factors within the kidney--angiotensin II and prostaglandins--which are rapidly released whenever renal perfusion is compromised or sympathetic nerve traffic to the kidneys is increased. Although these two hormonal systems exert opposite effects on systemic and renal blood flow and sodium and water excretion, both act to preserve glomerular filtration rate: prostaglandins by a vasodilator action exerted primarily on the afferent arteriole and angiotensin II by a vasoconstrictor effect on the efferent arteriole. Consequently, when the synthesis of these hormones is experimentally blocked, renal function deteriorates, especially in subjects with marked renal hypoperfusion and sodium depletion; these two factors interact to determine the importance of intrarenal hormonal release in the modulation of renal function. Clinically, four specific factors have been identified that predispose patients with heart failure to the development of functional renal insufficiency after treatment with converting-enzyme or cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors: (1) marked renal hypoperfusion, (2) vigorous diuretic therapy, (3) diabetes mellitus, and (4) intensity of hormonal inhibition within the kidney. This last risk factor may provide the basis for differentiating among enzyme-inhibitory drugs and suggests that renal insufficiency in low-output states may be minimized by the development of therapeutic agents that block hormonal synthesis selectively at sites that are critical to the disease process but spare the homeostatic tissue-based enzyme systems that exist within the kidney.\r"

Intraosseous lipomas may be subdivided into three groups depending on the degree of involution: I, solid tumors of viable lipocytes; II, transitional cases with partial fat necrosis and focal calcification but also regions of viable lipocytes; and III, late cases in which the fat cells have died with variable degree of cyst formation, calcification, and reactive new bone formation of a characteristic morphology. The tumor is a well-defined entity that may present with varying features due to its stage of evolution. Thus, lipomas have been confused with other benign tumors, cysts, and cases of bone infarction. Intraosseous lipoma is not as rare as the literature suggests, but has been rarely diagnosed. The lesion appears to undergo spontaneous involution, so that surgical excision may not be necessary in some cases.\r"

Twenty-four hour unilateral ureter occlusion gave rise to a marked vasoconstriction in the ipsilateral kidney after its release. Intravenous infusion of ANP doubled p-aminohippurate clearance and inulin clearance and elicited massive natriuresis in the hydronephrotic kidney, while in the contralateral kidney these clearance values were decreased and there was a lack of natriuresis. The responses in the latter kidney were also different from those in the normal rat, in which significant natriuresis was elicited by ANP even though a decrease in p-aminohippurate clearance occurred. 3. After the control kidney in the unilateral hydronephrotic rat was denervated either mechanically or by pretreatment with prazosin, ANP induced a natriuresis in both kidneys. Furthermore, the renal denervation prevented the decrease in inulin clearance in the control kidney after ANP administration. 4. These findings suggest that the renal response to ANP may depend on the vascular tone before administration, and that renal nerve activity may modify the effects of ANP on renal haemodynamics and sodium excretion.\r"

Also, diet-induced thermogenesis represented a quantitatively relevant portion of the total MR. There was a larger thermogenic effect of amino acids in S with respect to NS (22.3 vs. 5.7 cal/mg N, p less than .01) with a concomitantly increased thermogenic effect of fat. The results suggest the importance of recognizing the thermogenic effect of administered nutrients as an important determinant of MR during calorimetric measurements. The finding of an enhanced thermogenic effect of amino acids and fat in S also implies the need for more complete investigations of the impact of these substrates in modifying oxidative and energy metabolism in S.\r"

In order to determine the optimal doses, we investigated the antifibrillatory effects of a) high dose bretylium (10 mg/kg) and b) a combination of lidocaine (2 mg/kg) and bretylium (5 mg/kg) during CPR in two groups of anesthetized dogs. Ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) was determined using a train method and CPR was performed by a pneumatic device. During both a control and drug phase, the VFT was determined in each dog before CPR, and after each of three consecutive 3-min CPR periods. The combination of lidocaine and bretylium (11 dogs) caused a significant increase in VFT compared to the control phase after each of the 3-min CPR periods and maintained this effect for greater than 2 h. Bretylium 10 mg/kg (eight dogs) significantly elevated the VFT only after the third 3-min CPR period. We conclude that the combination of standard doses of lidocaine and bretylium produces a rapid and prolonged antifibrillatory effect and may be the optimal regimen in the CPR setting. High dose bretylium has a delayed onset of effect and appears to produce no greater effect than standard doses of the drug.\r"

Hemoglobin saturation as measured by pulse oximetry correlated significantly with PaO2 (r = .65, p less than .0001); more importantly, an oximeter O2 Sat less than 95% showed 100% sensitivity in identifying hypoxemia (i.e., PaO2 less than 70 torr). PetCO2 tended to correlate strongly with PaCO2 for individual patients, but not when evaluated as a screening tool for identifying ventilatory abnormalities in the overall group (r = .52, p less than .0001). A PetCO2 less than 26 torr identified hypocarbia (defined as PaCO2 less than 30 torr) with a sensitivity of 85%. However, a PetCO2 of greater than 40 torr predicted hypercarbia (PaCO2 greater than 45 torr) with a sensitivity of only 28%. The efficacy of pulse oximetry and capnometry in monitoring respiratory status during postoperative ventilatory weaning was examined in a subset of 24 patients who had undergone elective cardiac surgery. All patients were weaned by intermittent mandatory ventilation, but each was assigned randomly to either a control group monitored with periodic ABG sampling or to an experimental group, monitored by following PetCO2 and O2 Sat via pulse oximetry. In the experimental group, ABG values were obtained on ICU admission, but thereafter only if a) O2 Sat less than 95%, b) PetCO2 less than 26 or greater than 40 torr, or c) felt to be clinically indicated by ICU staff.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Enzymes of the blood coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades are prominent in both the vascular and alveolar compartments of the human lung. Important differences exist in the regulation of these enzyme activities between the vascular and the alveolar compartments, suggesting different functions of similar enzymes in the two compartments. In the vascular bed, endothelial cells provide a nonthrombogenic lining layer and release small amounts of tissue plasminogen activator into the circulation, maintaining patency of the vascular bed, whereas the alveolar epithelial surface is replete with active enzymes of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation as well as urokinase. The alveolar surface seems primed to localize and degrade any fibrin that has leaked into alveoli during hemorrhagic states. In addition, parenchymal lung cells such as resident macrophages are coated with urokinase, providing a mechanism for cellular migration and ongoing extracellular matrix metabolism. Amplification of the PA/plasmin system in the lung during chronic inflammation, eg, cigarette smoking, could accelerate connective tissue breakdown. Recent evidence indicates that in acute inflammation there is an enhancement of mediators of coagulation and suppression of fibrinolysis. These observations may partly explain prior pathologic observations regarding the deposition of hyaline membranes and persistence of alveolar fibrin/fibronectin deposits that may be stimulants for alveolar fibrosis. The assembly of clotting components on the surface of macrophages and the integral involvement of macrophages with fibrin deposits in the lung are likely mechanisms for macrophage immobilization and focal accumulation important to local clearance, host defense, effective chemotactic signalling, and possibly proliferation since thrombin has mitogenic properties for other lung cells. Newer methods focusing on the biology and biochemistry of the pulmonary architecture and its cellular components should further elucidate the importance of these pathways and suggest new therapeutic options.\r"

In fed female rats, gastric mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostacyclin (PGI2) generation was 235 +/- 25 and 832 +/- 40 ng/g/min, respectively, whereas full-thickness duodenal PGE2 and PGI2 generation was 665 +/- 46 and 662 +/- 49 ng/g/min, respectively. Over an intraperitoneal dose range of 0-25 mg/kg, aspirin-induced cyclooxygenase inhibition was dose-dependent and similar for the two tissues. Duodenal ulceration (16.7 mm2) produced by cysteamine, 425 mg/kg, was associated with a 46% reduction in duodenal PGE2 generation, while having no effect on PGI2 generation; however, cysteamine, 213 mg/kg, produced no visible duodenal mucosa injury yet reduced duodenal PGE2 generation 39% compared to control values. In fed male rats, gastric mucosal PGE2 and PGI2 generation was 179 +/- 18 and 813 +/- 61 ng/g/min, respectively, whereas duodenal PGE2 and PGI2 generation was 321 +/- 27 and 454 +/- 38 ng/g/min, respectively. Duodenal ulceration (7.7 +/- 2.3 mm2) produced by oral mepirizole was associated with a 63% reduction in duodenal PGE2 generation compared to control values, while having no effect on PGI2 generation.

  ".U": "88224828\r", 
  ".W": "In this study, I have investigated the structure of the rat brain insulin receptor during fetal development. There is a progressive decrease in the apparent molecular size of the brain alpha-subunit during development: 130K on day 16 of gestation, 126K at birth, and 120K in the adult. Glycosylation was investigated as a possible reason for the observed differences in the alpha-subunit molecular size. The results show that the developmental decrease in the brain alpha-subunit apparent molecular size is due to a parallel decrease in sialic acid content. This was further confirmed by measuring the retention of autophosphorylated insulin receptors on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose. An inverse correlation between developmental age and retention of 32P-labeled insulin receptors on the lectin column was observed. Insulin binding increases 6-fold between 16 and 20 days of gestation [61 +/- 25 (+/- SE) fmol/mg protein and 364 +/- 42 fmol/mg, respectively]. Thereafter, binding in brain membranes decreases to 150 +/- 20 fmol/mg by 2 days after birth, then reaches the adult level of 63 +/- 15 fmol/mg. In addition, the degree of insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation closely parallels the developmental changes in insulin binding. Between 16 and 20 days of fetal life, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the beta-subunit increases 6-fold. Thereafter, the extent of phosphorylation decreases rapidly, reaching adult values identical with those in 16-day-old fetal brain. These results suggest that the embryonic brain possesses competent insulin receptors whose expression changes markedly during fetal development. This information should be important in defining the role of insulin in the developing nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] affects phospholipid metabolism of intestine, kidney, and bone. There are no such studies concerning the parathyroid gland, which is also a target tissue for 1,25-(OH)2D3. In this investigation we examined the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the incorporation of radiolabeled choline, inositol, serine, and ethanolamine into the phospholipids of cultured bovine parathyroid cells. Treatment with 10(-8) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 48 h caused a significant decrease in [14C]choline incorporation, although there were no differences in the incorporation of radiolabeled inositol, serine, or ethanolamine. Time-course and dose-response evaluations of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 effect revealed that the decrease in [14C]choline incorporation was seen within 12 h of incubation and occurred with as little as 10(-9) M, respectively. In contrast, neither 10(-7) M 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 nor 10(-7) M 24,25-(OH)2D3 caused significant changes in [14C]choline incorporation. When 5 X 10(-6) M cycloheximide was added to the medium, the inhibitory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on [14C]choline incorporation was completely abolished. A significant decrease in phosphatidylcholine content was observed after treatment with 10(-8) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 96 h. 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not cause a dramatic change in the fatty acid composition of the phosphatidylcholine. The present studies demonstrate that in parathyroid cells 1,25-(OH)2D3 causes a decrease in [14C]choline incorporation, which could be due to a decrease in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine or increased degradation. This effect is specific for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and requires new protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "4-Hydroxyandrostene-3,17-dione (4-OHA) inhibits ovarian aromatase activity and causes regression of carcinogen-induced hormone-dependent mammary tumors in rats. Although estrogen levels were reduced, LH levels did not increase nor did uterine weight decline in 4-OHA-treated animals. These findings are in contrast to those in animals deprived of estrogen by ovariectomy. The possible direct action of 4-OHA on gonadotropin secretion and uterine growth was, therefore, investigated in ovariectomized rats not treated with the carcinogen. Treatment with 4-OHA for 2 weeks prevented regression of the uterus and the increase in gonadotropin secretion in ovariectomized rats in a dose-dependent manner. The effect on gonadotropin secretion of 4-OHA at 50 mg/kg.day was similar to that of dihydrotestosterone at 0.5 mg/kg.day and could be completely antagonized by administration of the antiandrogen flutamide. The stimulation of uterine growth by 4-OHA was also blocked by flutamide, but not by the antiestrogen enclomiphene. The trophic action of 4-OHA at 50 mg/kg.day was equivalent to that of 1.8 mg/kg.day dihydrotestosterone. Furthermore, treatment with 4-OHA caused a reduction in uterine estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor levels. The reduction in uterine estrogen and progesterone receptor levels was also counteracted by the concomitant injection of flutamide, but not by enclomiphene. The results suggest that in the rat 4-OHA has multiple actions on sex steroid target tissues in addition to inhibition of aromatase. The effects appear to be related to the androgenic rather than estrogenic activity of the compound. Inhibition of gonadotropins may help maintain reduced ovarian estrogen secretion and contribute to the antitumor activity of this compound.\r"

  ".W": "To study the incorporation of sulfate into thyroglobulin, human thyroid tissue was incubated with [35S]sulfate. Labeled thyroglobulin was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel exclusion chromatography, and equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, the last of these specifically to remove proteoglycans. [35S]Sulfate was found in thyroglobulin with low density, indicating that sulfate was incorporated into newly synthesized molecules before their iodination. Chondroitin ABC lyase and chondroitin AC lyase released equal amounts of [35S]sulfate, demonstrating the presence of chondroitin units, and TLC showed this to be predominantly chondroitin 6-sulfate. Additional [35S]sulfate was released by endoglycosidase-F (Endo-F), but not by Endo-H. The Endo-F-sensitive sulfate-labeled complex carbohydrate units were heterogeneous, one fraction passing through a Concanavalin-A-Sepharose column without delay and another fraction showing weak affinity for the lectin. More than 90% of the incorporated [35S]sulfate was accounted for by the chondroitin ABC lyase and Endo-F-sensitive fractions. Thus, human thyroglobulin contains sulfate in at least three types of carbohydrate units, 1) chondroitin 6-sulfate units, 2) complex units with no affinity for Concanavalin-A (tri- or tetraantennary forms), and 3) complex units with weak affinity for Concanavalin-A (biantennary forms).\r"

  ".W": "Receptor-activated transmembrane calcium flux has been implicated as a mediator of the actions of many growth factors and hormones. We examined the effects of PRL, calcium ionophores, and calcium antagonists on 45Ca2+ flux, c-myc gene expression, and DNA synthesis in the PRL-dependent rat Nb2 lymphoma cell line. PRL had no detectable effects on 45Ca2+ uptake or efflux, and the mitogenic effects of PRL could not be reproduced by the calcium ionophore A23187 alone or in combination with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13 acetate (TPA). PRL, but not A23187 or TPA, stimulated c-myc gene expression in quiescent Nb2 cells. Exposure to PRL for brief periods (15 min to 4 h), followed by extensive washing, resulted in a time- and dose-dependent activation of DNA synthesis measured 16 h later. This activation was not blocked by addition of excess anti-PRL antiserum after the wash steps, indicating that the observed stimulation was not due to residual PRL. Despite the marked increase in DNA synthesis, removal of PRL after 4 h prevented mitosis, suggesting that PRL may be required throughout the cell cycle for Nb2 cell proliferation. Although continuous incubation with calcium antagonists resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of PRL-stimulated DNA synthesis, activation of DNA synthesis by brief exposure to PRL was not inhibited by the presence of EGTA, calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, cobalt chloride), or calmodulin inhibitors (trifluoperazine, N-6-aminohexyl-5-chloronaphthalene sulfonamide). PRL-stimulated c-myc expression was attenuated, but not blocked, by the calcium channel antagonists. However, the putative intracellular calcium antagonist TMB-8 inhibited both c-myc expression and DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 16 microM). Nb2 cells were sensitive to TMB-8 throughout G1 of the cell cycle, but inhibition of DNA synthesis was greatest when TMB-8 was present during the first 3 h of mitogen presentation, indicating a block in the transition from G0 to G1 of the cell cycle. The effect of TMB-8 suggests that release of a small intracellular calcium pool may mediate the early actions of PRL in Nb2 cells.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the role of somatostatin (SRIF) in pulsatile GH secretion, profiles of the hormone release from intact anterior pituitaries of male rats were examined in an in vitro perifusion system. Infusion of human (h) GRF (0.1 microM) into the perifusion system for 10 min stimulated GH release, which peaked within 30-40 min. Two hours after the first stimulation, when basal GH release had not yet fallen to the original levels, the response to a second hGRF stimulation was attenuated to as low as 47.7 +/- 10.0% (+/- SE) of the first response. However, when GH release after the first stimulation had returned to the basal level after the first stimulation had returned to the basal level after perifusion with the medium for 3 h, the second response to hGRF was restored to a level similar to that of the first response. In contrast, when SRIF (0.1 microM) was infused for 50 min 1 h after the first stimulation to lower the GH baseline, the second response to hGRF was also restored to the level of the first response. Neither SRIF infusion after the first hGRF stimulation nor infusion of SRIF without hGRF caused any rebound increase in GH release after cessation of the perifusion. To determine whether SRIF exerts a direct action on the GH response, a prestimulatory perifusion with SRIF (0.1 microM) for 50 min was performed. The treatment tended to facilitate the pituitary response to hGRF. When 50-min pretreatment with SRIF at a lower concentration (0.05 microM) was given, a significantly facilitated response to the first hGRF stimulation (0.05 microM) was observed. These results suggest that 1) SRIF perifusion rapidly restores the attenuated response to a second hGRF challenge by lowering GH release to basal levels; and 2) SRIF pretreatment facilitates the GH response to the first hGRF challenge.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of cell lines were examined by Northern blot hybridization for the expression of PRL or PRL-related mRNAs. We found that a human B-lymphoblast cell line transcribed a mRNA which hybridized to human PRL cDNA under high stringency conditions. The human lymphoblast cell line of interest is a variant subline of the IM-9 line that we have designated IM-9-P. The lymphoblast-derived PRL mRNA is approximately 150 bases longer than that produced by the human pituitary as determined by Northern blot analysis. IM-9-P PRL was immunoaffinity purified from conditioned medium and found to be identical in mol wt by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to human pituitary PRL. Moreover, IM-9-P PRL is biologically active in the rat Nb2 lymphoma mitogenic assay. Ribonuclease-H digestion of mRNA poly(A) tracts indicated that the size difference between pituitary and IM-9-P PRL transcripts was not due to an elongated poly(A) tail on the lymphoid PRL mRNA. Genomic Southern blot analysis showed no major rearrangements of the PRL gene in IM-9-P cells compared to the parent IM-9 line and human placenta DNA. Thus, it is highly likely that an elongation of the 5' and/or 3' untranslated regions of IM-9-P PRL mRNA account for the size difference with pituitary PRL mRNA. The PRL-producing IM-9-P line was cloned by limiting dilution, and a high PRL-producing clone IM-9-P3 and a non-PRL producer IM-9-P6 were isolated for further analysis. IM-9-P3 cells were found to secrete 40-50 ng PRL/10(6) cells.24 h regardless of cell density. The level of PRL mRNA also remained constant during exponential growth of IM-9-P3 cells. The existence of the PRL-producing IM-9-P3 clone and the IM-9-P6 clone which does not produce PRL as well as the IM-9 progenitor line provides a unique system with which to analyze the molecular mechanism of ectopic human PRL expression.\r"

  ".U": "88224849\r", 
  ".W": "We previously reported that the rat posterior pituitary contains a potent PRL-releasing factor (PRF) which is distinct from oxytocin (OT), TRH, and angiotensin II (AII). The objectives of this study were 1) to examine whether posterior pituitary extracts stimulate PRL release in the presence of dopamine (DA), 2) to determine the chemical nature of PRF, and 3) to estimate its mol wt. Perifused anterior pituitary cells were used to assess PRF activity. Posterior pituitaries and medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) fragments were extracted with perchloric acid and lyophilized. Subsequent to various treatments, samples were reconstituted in the perifusion medium and introduced to the cells in short pulses. Fractions were collected and analyzed for hormone content by RIA. During a constant infusion of DA (50 nM), PRL secretion was inhibited by 75%, yet the posterior pituitary extract retained its ability to rapidly stimulate PRL release. Studies using proteolytic enzymes showed that posterior pituitary PRF was resistant to inactivation by trypsin, whereas the PRF activity of AII was abolished. Both chymotrypsin and proline-specific endopeptidase significantly reduced the PRF activity in the posterior pituitary. The PRL-releasing activity of TRH was not affected by chymotrypsin. Immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was undetectable in posterior pituitary extracts. Oxidation of posterior pituitary extracts with performic acid caused only a modest reduction of their PRF activity, while the ability of OT to stimulate PRL release as well as immunoreactive OT was abolished. Studies using ultrafiltration membranes showed that the PRF activity in the posterior pituitary was less than 5,000 mol wt. Furthermore, posterior pituitary PRF partitioned in nearly equal amounts across 1K membranes, as did AII and OT. In contrast, about 80% of the PRF activity in the MBH and all of the synthetic TRH passed through the 1K membranes. We conclude that 1) posterior pituitary PRF can stimulate PRL secretion from perifused anterior pituitary cells in the presence of physiological concentrations of DA; 2) PRF is a small peptide(s) of less than 5,000, and perhaps closer to 1,000, mol wt; 3) PRF is resistant to inactivation by trypsin and to oxidation by performic acid, but is hydrolyzed by both chymotrypsin and proline-specific endopeptidase; and 4) these data further distinguish posterior pituitary PRF from known PRL secretagogues.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the relationship between insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake and cytosolic free calcium concentrations, [( Ca2+]i), in adipocytes isolated from 2- and 12-month-old rats. The basal rates of glucose uptake and the levels of cytosolic Ca2+ were only minimally reduced in 12-month-old animals. In contrast, insulin-stimulated glucose up-take and [Ca2+]i were significantly decreased in older adipocytes at all insulin concentrations (P less than 0.01). When the rate of glucose uptake was plotted as a function of [Ca2+]i, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was almost identical in older and younger animals at any given level of [Ca2+]i. Similar to insulin, glyburide and K+ increased [Ca2+]i in both younger and older adipocytes. However, glyburide- and K+-elicited responses were lower in older rats (P less than 0.01). The effects of insulin, glyburide, and K+ on [Ca2+]i are mediated via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Thus, the present observations suggest an impairment in either function and/or availability of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in older animals. This was supported by the finding of reduced [3H]nitrendipine binding in adipocytes isolated from older animals (6.5% vs. 3.3% in 2- and 12-month-old rats, respectively; P less than 0.01). The results of these experiments indicate that the postreceptor changes in adipocyte responsiveness to insulin in aging may involve inadequate increases in [Ca2+]i. The latter probably occurs as a result of decreased availability and/or function of the voltage-dependent calcium channels.\r"

  ".W": "A two-chamber assembly has been employed to investigate influences of peritubular cells (PC) and extracellular matrix (Matrigel) on barrier formation by Sertoli cells (SC) in culture and on transferrin production. The kinetics of transport of [3H]inulin across a Millipore filter were essentially the same in the presence or absence of Matrigel or PC. In contrast, a SC monolayer retarded the diffusion of [3H]inulin, increasing the estimated time for 50% equilibration from about 4 h to approximately 12 h. Matrigel and PC each independently further increased the equilibration time, with the largest effects elicited by the presence of Matrigel (approximately 21 h). Data have been interpreted to indicate that these two components, especially extracellular matrix, facilitate the formation of a functional barrier by SC in the two-chamber system. PC assume a more important role than Matrigel in the modulation of transferrin secretion by SC. Transferrin concentrations were higher in the inner chamber, corresponding to those in the adluminal compartment, but transferrin masses were higher in the outer chamber under the conditions described. We report the effects of the presence and absence of Matrigel, PC, and FSH on levels of transferrin secreted by SC. Addition of FSH resulted in increased transferrin secretion by SC maintained under all conditions examined. We compare our data with those previously reported by others and attempt to provide a basis for the differences observed. We discuss the properties of the system and outline major advantages and limits of the two-chamber assembly in investigations on the polarity and properties of SC in culture.\r"

Although transferrin concentrations are greatest in the inner chamber, concentrations of PA activities in the outer chamber are equal to or higher than those in the inner chamber. These data indicate that transferrin and PA are preferentially secreted in different directions. The addition of FSH or cAMP derivatives stimulates the formation and secretion of tissue-type PA. Addition of FSH enhances the polarized secretion of PA into the outer chamber, as measured by elevated ratios of outer to inner compartment PA concentrations. Ratios of PA to transferrin concentrations in the outer compartment are also increased in FSH-treated preparations, demonstrating that the differential secretion of the two products is enhanced by FSH. We interpret these data to indicate that polarized SC preferentially secrete transferrin apically while preferentially secreting PA basally, and that FSH augments this polarity of SC maintained in the two-chamber assembly. The addition of peritubular cells to the system results in decreased levels of total PA activity, with greatest diminution evident in the outer compartment. Data are consistent with previous observations that peritubular cells decrease PA activity by secreting a specific inhibitor of PA. Measurements of relative amounts of transferrin and PA secreted into inner and outer chambers, respectively, provide a means to evaluate the tightness of the seminiferous tubule barrier in the model system and the extent of polarized secretion by SC in the two-chambered assembly.\r"

These antibodies recognize both the heavy (48,400-dalton) and light (43,000-dalton) subunits of the native ABP molecule. In addition, they recognize the subunits from which Asn-linked oligosaccharides have been removed by treatment with N-glycanase, indicating that these moieties do not form the immunological determinants recognized by the antibodies. Two of these antibodies are capable of recognizing both nondenatured ABP, as assessed by dot blot analysis, and denatured ABP, as determined by Western blot analysis of ABP after electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The immunoreactivity of denatured ABP is decreased with two of the antibodies, suggesting that they more readily recognize the antigenic epitopes when the protein is in its native configuration. The antibodies were capable of immunoprecipitating covalently labeled ABP from solution. All four monoclonal antibodies produced were determined to be immunoglobulins M by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Ouchterlony immunodiffusion even though the initial serum response of the immunized animals indicated the presence of immunoglobulins G. All of the monoclonal antibodies raised against rat ABP cross-reacted with rabbit and human testosterone-binding globulin (TeBG). They were able to detect two subunits when Western blots of intact rabbit [mol wt (Mr, 43,000 and 40,500] or human (Mr, 47,600 and 44,500) TeBG were probed, but only a single subunit (Mr, 39,300) when deglycosylated samples of rabbit TeBG were analyzed.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we have examined the effects of FSH, forskolin, and (Bu)2cAMP on messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for all known subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in rat Sertoli cells, using newly developed complementary DNA (cDNA) probes. mRNAs for the three regulatory subunits [RI alpha, RII51, (RII beta), and RII54 (RII alpha)] and the catalytic subunit C alpha were shown to be present in cultured rat Sertoli cells, whereas mRNAs for the subunits designated RI beta and C beta were below the level of detection. A high-levelled, concentration-dependent increase in a 3.2 kilobase mRNA for RII51 was observed when cultured immature Sertoli cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of (Bu)2cAMP (10(-6) to 5 X 10(-3) M) for 16 h. Densitometric scanning indicated a maximal stimulation by (Bu)2cAMP of 30- to 40-fold. Incubation with forskolin (100 microM) and FSH (200 ng/ml) gave rise to a smaller but significant increase in mRNA for RII51. When cultured Sertoli cells were incubated in the presence of 10(-4) M (Bu)2cAMP for varying time periods, there was a biphasic regulation of mRNA for RII51. (Bu)2cAMP caused an initial increase in mRNA for RII51 with maximal levels obtained after 10-16 h, after which a time-dependent decrease was observed. For the other three subunits present in Sertoli cells (RI alpha, RII54, and C alpha) a smaller but significant stimulation by (Bu)2cAMP and forskolin (2-4 fold) was seen. The functional implications of these changes in mRNA levels for the different subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase have not yet been revealed. However, our data clearly demonstrate differential regulation of the various subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in Sertoli cells. Furthermore, these results document the presence of distinct adaptational changes taking place at the level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in response to long term elevation of cAMP.\r"

  ".U": "88224868\r", 
  ".W": "Multiple forms of PRL differing in their physicochemical and biological characteristics have been described. We have analyzed the molecular forms of human (h) PRL released in culture by pure hPRL-secreting tumors with a particular attention to glycosylated hPRL. The prolactinoma cells from six different tumors released, in serum-free conditions, 10-28 mg hPRL. The combination of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting techniques using a [125I]anti-hPRL monoclonal antibody allowed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the hPRL variants. The ratio of the glycosylated 25,000-mol wt form (G-hPRL) to the 23,000-mol wt nonglycosylated monomeric hPRL (NG-hPRL) varied from 0.13 to 0.25. Under the conditions of our studies, cleaved forms of the hormone (19,000 and 15,000 mol wt) accounted for less than 5% of the total immunoreactivity. G- and NG-hPRL were subsequently purified by gel filtration and lectin affinity chromatography. G-hPRL appeared fully sensitive to endoglycosidase F digestion, further supporting the presence of a freely accessible N-linked carbohydrate chain. When assayed for their ability to react with polyclonal antibodies directed against hPRL in a competitive RIA, G-hPRL was 3 times less immunoreactive than NG-hPRL. However, both types of hPRL exhibited superimposable displacement curves when tested in an immunoassay using an anti-hPRL monoclonal antibody. In binding studies using crude rabbit mammary gland membranes G-hPRL was half as potent as NG-hPRL. In stimulating the growth of the Nb2 lymphoma cell line, G-hPRL was 50% less active than NG-hPRL. Thus 1) under basal conditions, hPRL undergoes partial and variable glycosylation; 2) glycosylation of the hormone may modulate its immunoreactivity; 3) glycosylation of hPRL not only lowers its mammary gland receptor binding capacity but also its growth-promoting activity.\r"

In this study we have characterized and localized EC in the rat heart and examined its correspondence with atrial natriuretic factor. Heart homogenates bind [3H]guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid ([ 3H]GEMSA), a selective ligand for enkephalin convertase, with specificity and high affinity (Kd = 5-10 nM). The pharmacology of these sites matches that of convertase catalytic activity and of [3H]GEMSA binding in other tissues. The binding sites in the heart can be purified 4000-fold using p-aminobenzoylarginine affinity chromatography, and the purified sites have Co2+ stimulated carboxypeptidase activity identical to EC. By subcellular fractionation studies [3H]GEMSA-binding sites are localized to the granule fraction with ANF immunoreactivity. [3H]GEMSA autoradiography localizes EC in the heart to the left and right atria, with very low levels in mature and ventricles. The distribution, biochemical properties, and developmental course of EC suggest that it may be involved in the synthesis of atrial natriuretic factor.\r"

  ".W": "The rat Sertoli cell in culture expresses A1 inhibitory adenosine receptors. In this study, we have used pertussis toxin as a tool to characterize the mechanism of action of adenosine on these cells. Cells were preincubated for 18-24 h with pertussis toxin, and the responses to FSH and to the adenosine analog phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) were measured by assaying cAMP accumulation. The effect of toxin on adenosine receptors was also evaluated by measuring binding of the adenosine agonist cyclohexyladenosine (CHA). The total number of specific CHA-binding sites was reduced 60-70% in membranes prepared from cells cultured for 24 h in the presence of pertussis toxin; the binding sites remaining after treatment displayed no apparent change in affinity for [3H]CHA. The effect of guanine nucleotides on CHA binding was also reduced after toxin pretreatment, but not abolished. PIA inhibited FSH-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 70-80%. Maximal inhibition was observed at a concentration of 10 nM PIA, and the ED50 of the dose-response curve was 1 nM. Pretreatment of the Sertoli cell with pertussis toxin completely blocked the PIA inhibition. The pertussis toxin effect was time and dose dependent. Reversal of the inhibition was observed after 6 h of treatment with a maximal dose of toxin (100 ng/ml). The dose of toxin producing a half-maximal effect was 10-30 ng/ml. In addition to this blockade of purine nucleotide inhibitory effects, exposure of the Sertoli cell to pertussis toxin concentrations ranging from 1-400 ng/ml consistently led to a potentiation of the FSH response measured as cAMP accumulation. In cell-free preparations (crude particulate fraction of the Sertoli cells, or sucrose gradient-purified plasma membranes), pertussis toxin catalyzed the incorporation of [32P]ADP ribose into a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 40-41 K. This peptide had electrophoretic mobility similar to that of a partially purified guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gi). These data indicate that adenosine A1 inhibitory receptors are coupled to an inhibitory component (Gi) of adenylate cyclase. In the Sertoli cell, inhibitory and stimulatory signals interact in a bimodal regulation of adenylate cyclase and intracellular cAMP.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we investigated the ability of phorbol esters to potentiate Ca2+-dependent depolarization-induced release of tritium-labeled dopamine ([3H]DA) from median eminence and striatal synaptosomes. Phorbol esters potentiated [3H]DA release in a concentration-dependent manner in both kinds of dopaminergic nerve terminals and with a potency series similar to that reported for stimulation of protein kinase-C (PKC) activity in other cell systems. Evoked [3H]DA release was increased by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 10(-7) M) after 1, 3, 5, and 10 sec of depolarization. The effect of TPA was suppressed by sphingosine, a PKC inhibitor. TPA enhanced [3H]DA release evoked by high K+, veratridine or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Phorbol ester potentiation was found to be depolarization dependent, as it was present from 30-75 mM, but not at 5-20 mM external K+. Potentiation was seen at all external Ca2+ concentrations studied between 0.01-3 mM. However, in the absence of external free Ca2+ (i.e. with 0.1 mM EGTA), the phorbol effect was not present. These data indicate that an increase in intrasynaptosomal Ca2+ concentration is necessary for the enhancement of [3H]DA release by phorbol esters to occur. The combination of TPA and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 does not show the marked synergism observed in some other systems, that is maximal release was not reinstated. This suggests that in dopaminergic nerve terminals, activation of PKC has a modulatory, rather than a mediating, effect on release. Recently, we have shown that hyperprolactinemia stimulated [3H]DA release from median eminence synaptosomes by an external Ca2+-independent mechanism which might involve the PKC pathway. However, in the present work we found that the TPA and PRL effects on evoked [3H]DA release were additive, suggesting that two independent mechanisms are involved. A marked difference in the sensitivity of median eminence and striatal synaptosomes to calcium ionophore was discovered. The concentration of A23187 required to support significant [3H]DA release from median eminence synaptosomes was 3-fold greater than that in striatal synaptosomes. This suggests that some difference in calcium homeostatic processes exists, such as a higher resting striatal Ca2+ concentration, in these two kinds of dopaminergic nerve terminals. These data support the hypothesis that PKC activation potentiates the intrasynaptosomal stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism(s) and that nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic nerve terminals are affected by phorbol esters in a similar manner.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OH-E2) synthesized locally from estradiol (E2) stimulates progesterone production by granulosa cells (GC) and enhances the action of other trophic hormones. A particularly strong synergistic interaction between 2-OH-E2 and beta-adrenergic agonists was observed. Therefore, the present studies were undertaken to determine if this synergism was due to a 2-OH-E2-stimulated increase in the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites in GC. Binding of the 125I-labeled beta-adrenergic ligand iodocyanopindolol ([125I]iodo-CYP) to GC was evaluated and was found to be saturable with time and ligand concentration, and of high affinity (Kd = 29 +/- 8 pM; maximum binding = 0.55 +/- 0.02 fmol/10(6) cells). Rank order potency for agonist/antagonist binding was consistent with a beta-adrenergic receptor: propranolol greater than isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine. 2-OH-E2 did not compete for the [125I]iodo-CYP-binding sites. Incubation of cultured porcine GC with 2-OH-E2 caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in the number of specific [125I]iodo-CYP-binding sites. Averaged over eight separate experiments, 4-day treatment with 4 micrograms/ml 2-OH-E2 increased the number of [125I]iodo-CYP-binding sites 3.1 +/- 0.9-fold above the control value (P less than 0.05). A similar 4-day treatment with 2 micrograms/ml E2 or 200 ng/ml LH or FSH was without effect on [125I]iodo-CYP binding (P greater than 0.05) despite stimulation of progesterone secretion to a degree similar to that seen with 2-OH-E2. These results support the hypothesis that 2-OH-E2 produced by GC may enhance progesterone production stimulated by catecholamines, in part by increasing the numbers of beta-adrenergic binding sites on GC.\r"

Ang II receptors, estimated by the specific binding of the Ang II receptor antagonist [125I]iodo-[Sar1,Ile8] Ang II to ovarian membranes, were lowest at estrus [binding site density (Bmax) = 35 +/- 2 fmol/mg; binding site affinity (KD) = 2.0 +/- 0.2 nM] and highest at diestrus I (Bmax = 59 +/- 3 fmol/mg; KD = 1.6 +/- 0.1 nM). We have previously shown that Ang II receptors in the rat ovary predominantly exist on the granulosa cell layer of a subpopulation of follicles. Our present studies show that the Ang II receptor-containing follicles in the rat ovary are mainly atretic (approximately 80%) or show signs of early atresia (approximately 15%) during all stages of the estrous cycle. A small number of Ang II receptor-containing follicles were healthy (approximately 5%). In contrast to the Ang II receptor-containing follicles, the FSH receptor-containing follicles were predominantly healthy (greater than 90%). Follicles which contained both Ang II receptors and FSH receptors were mainly early atretic. Since Ang II receptor-containing follicles in the rat ovary were mainly atretic these studies suggest that in the rat Ang II may be a major factor in regulating the function of atretic ovarian follicles.\r"

We have investigated the possibility that additional structural variants of GnRH are present in mammalian (sheep, rat, and human) hypothalamus. Hypothalami were extracted with acetic acid and subjected to gel filtration chromatography and reverse phase HPLC systems specifically designed to separate GnRH analogs. Column fractions were assayed for immunoreactive GnRH using a library of specific antisera raised against the five known vertebrate GnRHs. Biological activity of the fractions was assessed by measuring their ability to release LH and FSH from cultured rat pituitary cells and/or LH release from dispersed chicken pituitary cells. Receptor binding activity was also measured in fractions from the human extract, using rat pituitary membranes. Several immunoreactive and biologically active forms of GnRH were found in sheep, rat, and human hypothalami. The major immunoreactive peptide consistently coeluted with mammalian GnRH. The other forms were not identifiable as any of the other known vertebrate GnRHs. Control experiments suggest these are modified forms of mammalian GnRH, which are artifacts generated during HPLC purification. Chromatographic and immunological studies indicate these forms of GnRH include peptides eluting both earlier and later than mammalian GnRH and which appear to be modified in the middle region and/or at the COOH-terminus of the molecule. Novel immunoreactive forms of GnRH, distinct from modified mammalian GnRH, were not apparent in any of the species. In chicken and rat pituitary cell bioassays and in rat receptor binding studies, the mammalian form of GnRH in HPLC fractions of the sheep and human hypothalamus displayed activity appropriate for this immunoreactive peak being mammalian GnRH. Some of the additional immunoreactive peaks (thought to be modified forms of mammalian GnRH) also displayed LH-releasing activity in the chicken and rat systems. Gonadotropin-releasing activity or receptor binding activity due to a second, novel, GnRH-like substance in HPLC fractions of the sheep and human hypothalamus was not detected. These data provide evidence for a single form of GnRH in sheep, rat, and human hypothalamus, unlike species from other vertebrate classes where two or more GnRHs are present within a single tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Preovulatory changes in the steroidogenic function of primate granulosa cells were studied using the cyclic marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as a model. Antral follicles (greater than or equal to 0.5 mm diameter) were dissected from mid-late follicular phase ovaries (7 days after prostaglandin-induced luteolysis) and classified by diameter as small (0.5-1.0 mm), medium (1.1-1.9 mm) or large (greater than or equal to 2.0 mm). Granulosa cells from follicles in each size category were isolated and pooled to assess steroid biosynthesis. The aromatase activity of freshly isolated granulosa cells from large follicles was 200 times greater than that of small follicles, confirming their relatively advanced preovulatory status. Granulosa cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence and absence of human (h) FSH (0.1 ng/ml), with and without 0.1 microM androgen (testosterone or 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone), to assess basal and hormone-responsive steroidogenesis (progesterone accumulation in culture medium and aromatase activity in washed granulosa cell monolayers). Basal granulosa cell steroidogenesis increased with follicular size, and there was a development-related pattern of response to hFSH and androgen. hFSH responsiveness (maximum fold-stimulation induced by hFSH) declined with follicular size, being 2-6 times greater for granulosa cells from small vs. large follicles. On the other hand, hFSH sensitivity increased with follicular size; the dose of hFSH giving 50% of the maximum response (ED50) for cells from large follicles being 10-20 times less than that of cells from small follicles. For granulosa cells from small follicles, treatment with 0.1 microM androgen in the presence of hFSH led to dramatic (up to 16-fold) enhancement of steroidogenic responses to hFSH. In contrast, for granulosa cells from large follicles, the presence of androgen substantially inhibited aromatase activity stimulated by hFSH and had weak inhibitory effects on progesterone accumulation. These results show that granulosa cell steroidogenesis becomes increasingly sensitive to hFSH during preovulatory follicular development in marmosets. The marked ability of androgen to directly augment hFSH-responsive steroidogenesis in vitro is lost during preovulatory development, such that androgen acts in mature granulosa cells to suppress hFSH-stimulated aromatase activity. These observations are evidence of development-dependent changes in granulosa cell responses to FSH and androgens which may contribute to the control of preovulatory follicular development in primates.\r"

Dispersed pituitary cells from 7- to 8-week-old male rats were perifused on a Cytodex bead matrix and stimulated with 10 nM GnRH for 2 min every hour for 8-11 h. The addition of a preparation of inhibin partially purified from primate Sertoli cells reduced pulsatile FSH release within 2 h. After removal of inhibin from the perifusion medium, the effect was reversed within 3 h. GnRH-stimulated LH release was also influenced by inhibin, although the decline in LH was less than that in FSH (80 +/- 3% vs. 68 +/- 4% of control; P less than 0.025). Smaller doses of inhibin suppressed GnRH-induced FSH secretion, but had no effect on LH release. Further, prolonged incubation of pituitary cells with inhibin at the higher dose reduced its FSH inhibitory effect and eliminated the effect on LH. These results indicate that inhibin can reduce both LH and FSH secretion in vitro, although the specificity and magnitude of the effect are a function of both the dose and duration of inhibin treatment. Further, the actions of inhibin and GnRH on the pituitary may be interrelated.\r"

The increased serum levels of gonadotropins and their subunits in castrates were dramatically suppressed by the administration of rabbit anti-GnRH serum (RAGnRH). However, this treatment had no effect on the serum levels of PRL, suggesting that the passive immunization to GnRH used in this study was only effective in blocking the hormonal activity of GnRH to the gonadotropin secretion. Mitosis of the gonadotrophs in normal rat anterior pituitary was rarely observed, but it was dramatically increased by castration. This elevated mitotic activity of gonadotrophs in the castrated rats was significantly suppressed by the administration of RAGnRH. On the other hand, mitotic activity of mammotrophs was decreased by castration. This diminution in the mitotic activity of mammotrophs was not changed by administration of RAGnRH. These results showed that GnRH is an important factor for stimulation of gonadotroph cell proliferation in castrated rats.\r"

  ".W": "The stimulation of polyphosphoinositide (PPI) turnover is associated with cellular activation and hormone secretion in numerous systems. GTP-binding proteins appear to couple receptors to phospholipase-C-mediated PPI breakdown. We assessed the effects of fluoride, an activator of GTP-binding proteins, on inositol phosphate accumulation, intracellular free Ca2+ [(Ca2+)i], cAMP content, and PTH release in dispersed bovine parathyroid cells. Sodium fluoride (5-30 mM) produced marked dose-dependent increases in inositol phosphates. With anion exchange HPLC, we confirmed that 30 mM fluoride stimulated a rapid increase in 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate, a potent Ca2+-mobilizing compound. Using the Ca2+-sensitive probe fura-2, we determined that 30 mM fluoride increased [Ca2+]i from 339 +/- 9 to 650 +/- 39 nM (n = 8) within 30-60 sec at 1 mM extracellular Ca2+. After the depletion of extracellular Ca2+ by the addition of 1 mM EGTA, 30 mM fluoride increased [Ca2+]i 45 +/- 9% (n = 4), indicating that fluoride can mobilize intracellular Ca2+ stores. Fluoride (1-30 mM) also inhibited PTH release in dose-dependent fashion. Fluoride (30 mM) produced 72.8 +/- 4.2% suppression of maximal low Ca2+-stimulated PTH release comparable to the 83.7 +/- 3.7% inhibition by 2.0 mM extracellular Ca2+. Since changes in both [Ca2+]i and cAMP regulate PTH release, we measured the effect of fluoride on intracellular cAMP. Fluoride did not detectably change basal cAMP content, but it reduced forskolin-stimulated increases in cAMP. We conclude that fluoride may activate at least two GTP-dependent processes in parathyroid cells, resulting in PPI breakdown and cAMP accumulation. While both may contribute to the fluoride-induced suppression of PTH release, our findings suggest that the stimulation of PPI turnover leads to inhibition of PTH secretion.\r"

Confluent third passage chondrocytes derived from the resting zone and adjacent growth region of rat costochondral cartilage were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and increasing concentrations of hormone. After determination of cell number, matrix vesicles and plasma membranes were isolated by differential centrifugation. The effects of hormone on alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase, and phospholipid composition were dependent on vitamin D metabolite and were cell specific. Growth cartilage chondrocytes responded primarily to 1,25-(OH)2D3, whereas resting zone cells responded primarily to 24,25-(OH)2D3. 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited growth cartilage cell number at pharmacological concentrations and had no effect on resting cartilage cell number. In contrast, 24,25-(OH)2D3 appeared to stimulate resting cartilage cell number at physiological concentrations and inhibit these cells at pharmacological doses, but had no effect on growth cartilage chondrocytes. These data were supported by [3H]thymidine incorporation studies. 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase activity, and Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the matrix vesicles of growth cartilage cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 also stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the matrix vesicles and plasma membranes of resting zone cells. Incubation with 24,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, and Na+/K+-ATPase in the matrix vesicles produced by resting zone cells. In addition, 24,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the plasma membranes of resting zone cells as well as in both matrix vesicles and plasma membranes of growth cartilage cells.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoid excess leads to the development of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but the site(s) and mechanisms of glucocorticoid action are uncertain. We studied the effects of various doses of dexamethasone (Dex) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in intact and castrate testosterone-replaced (cast + T) male rats and attempted to determine possible sites of Dex effects. A dose-dependent suppression of basal gonadotropin secretion was induced by 5 days of Dex treatment (20, 100, 500, or 2,500 micrograms/kg.day), and the highest dose completely abolished the postcastration rise in pituitary GnRH receptor number (GnRH-R) and serum gonadotropin levels. Administration of exogenous GnRH (0.02-200 micrograms/day over 2 days) resulted in a dose-dependent induction in GnRH-R in both intact and cast + T rats, but the effect was significantly (P less than 0.01) augmented in Dex-treated animals. In contrast, acute LH and FSH responses to GnRH (10, 25, 50, 100, or 250 ng, iv) were significantly blunted in Dex-treated rats. The data suggest that 1) Dex suppresses hypothalamic GnRH secretion, thereby preventing the postcastration rises in GnRH-R and gonadotropins; 2) at the pituitary level, Dex dissociates GnRH-R and gonadotropin responses to GnRH, augmenting GnRH-R induction by GnRH and suppressing gonadotropin responses to GnRH at a postreceptor site; and 3) the model of Dex-treated rats may be useful to study differential GnRH regulation of GnRH-R and gonadotropin secretion.\r"

Pooled rat plasma was found to generate 170 pmol LEIP and 76 pmol MEIP/ml plasma. Two peaks of enkephalin (enk)-immunoreactive peptides (EIP) were observed after gel filtration of plasma digests; the early eluting peak (which contained 90% of the total LEIP and 75% of the total MEIP) eluted close to, but not in, the void volume of the column, whereas the elution volume of a later eluting peak (which contained 25% of the total MEIP and about 5% of the total LEIP) was close to that of authentic enk. Five peaks of EIP with pI values of 3.7, 5.8, 7.3, 8.0, and 9.4, were observed after isoelectric focusing of plasma digests; with the exception of the pI 3.7 peak, all of these immunoreactive species could be detected with greater efficiency using the Leu-enk RIA. Peptic digestion of rat serum albumin generated a MEIP with the same pI and HPLC retention time as the plasma pI 3.7 MEIP. No other EIP could be generated from rat serum albumin. No immunoreactive peptides were found which coeluted with synthetic Met-enk or its sulfoxide on HPLC; however, a portion of low mol wt LEIP was eluted with the retention time of authentic Leu-enk. With certain exceptions, these results support and extend the original findings of Singer and Carraway concerning the ability of pepsin to generate extremely high concentrations of EIPs from plasma protein(s).\r"

In liver cells from hypothyroid rats this activation occurred at a 7-fold lower rate. However, complete activation of glycogen synthase occurred eventually in broken-cell preparations from either source during incubation in vitro. Glycogen synthase phosphatase was then quantitatively assayed in liver homogenates with exogenous synthase b as substrate. These assays revealed an increased synthase phosphatase activity (approximately 160%) in the hyperthyroid liver and a decreased activity (to approximately 60%) in the livers from hypothyroid rats. These activity changes involved both the cytosolic and the glycogen-bound synthase phosphatase. The increase in the activity of synthase phosphatase after the administration of T3 became maximal after 48 h. We conclude that thyroid hormones control hepatic glycogen synthesis, at least partly by an effect on synthase phosphatase.\r"

  ".W": "The cytosolic free calcium concentration and cumulative GH release were measured simultaneously in normal pituitary cells. This was made possible by a novel combination of fluorescence microscopy using the calcium indicator fura-2 and a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. GRF (10 nM) rapidly increased the intracellular free calcium concentration ([ Ca2+]i) from a basal level of 234 +/- 17 nM (mean +/- SE) to a peak value of 480 +/- 61 nM 1 min after stimulation. This GRF-induced calcium rise was totally abolished in calcium-free medium or in the presence of calcium channel blockers cobalt chloride (2 mM) and verapamil (100 microM). When somatostatin (SRIF; 1 nM) was added after basal recordings, cytosolic calcium decreased to 96 +/- 23 nM in identified somatotropes. [Ca2+]i returned to baseline upon the removal of SRIF inhibition. This rebound was higher when a sequential treatment of SRIF followed by GRF was applied. Exposing cells to a combination of GRF (10 nM) plus SRIF (1 nM) resulted in a decrease in [Ca2+]i identical to that caused by SRIF treatment alone. Despite the 10-fold excess of GRF, SRIF not only inhibited hormone secretion, but also totally overcame the GRF-induced rise of [Ca2+]i. In summary, stimulation by GRF increases cytosolic calcium in normal somatotropes. This increase is proposed to be due to the influx of calcium through membrane ion channels. In contrast, SRIF decreases [Ca2+]i. This might explain the cAMP-independent effects of this peptide. The effect of SRIF dominates over that of GRF with respect to both changes in [Ca2+]i and hormone release. Changes in the GH secretory rate are, therefore, accompanied by parallel changes in [Ca2+]i, both of which are primarily regulated by SRIF.\r"

Insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation, as determined by measurement of 14CO2 production, was enhanced 106% after administration of hGH-(1-43) at a dosage of 1 microgram/day for 3 days. A significant increase in CO2 production was detected with as little as 100 ng peptide/day for 3 days. A single injection of 10 micrograms increased sensitivity to insulin 2-5 times. This enhancing effect of insulin action could not be seen in lean agouti A/a animals nor could it be demonstrated by in vitro addition of hGH-(1-43) to adipose tissue. Synthetic hGH-(1-43) was used for these studies, but initial physiological work was done with peptide isolated from pituitary glands. At equimolar doses, intact hGH, a trypsin digest of either hGH or BSA, carbidomethyl cysteine-hGH-(146-191), and hGH-(32-46) were inactive. Carbidomethyl cysteine-hGH-(1-139) and hGH-(1-15) showed the enhancing property, but were only about 10% as active as hGH-(1-43). HGH-(1-43) did not increase serum insulin concentrations in the obese mice. We conclude that when administered in vivo to obese mice, hGH-(1-43) enhances the sensitivity of adipose tissue to the action of insulin, an indication that the peptide may play a role in carbohydrate metabolism.\r"

The cumulative probability of remaining seizure-free in this series was 74.5%. Three-quarters of the relapses occurred during the withdrawal period and in the 2 years thereafter. From multivariate analysis, the factors indicating a significantly higher relapse risk were seizures with a known cause and female sex. In primary generalized epilepsy, no factor significantly increased the likelihood of a recurrence. In partial epilepsy, significant factors predictive of recurrence were the presence of a neurological deficit (focal neurological signs and/or mental retardation), female sex, a positive family history for epilepsy, and the number of drugs necessary for control of the seizures. The present results are compared with the available literature data. It is argued that using multivariate analysis after elimination of EEG variables uncovers significant clinical predictive factors that in other studies may have remained hidden. Finally, it is argued that statistical analysis may be used to enable the clinician to predict the likelihood of recurrence in individual children with a given set of relevant predictive factors.\r"

At menses, female monkeys received human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH, 60 IU, days 1 to 6) followed by human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG, 60 IU hFSH/60 IU luteinizing hormone [hLH], days 7 to 9). On day 10, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was given to mimic the LH surge. Nine days later, a regimen of daily increasing doses of hCG (15 to 360 IU twice a day) was initiated to simulate rescue of the corpus luteum in early pregnancy. Serum levels of progesterone (P) increased through day 5 of the luteal phase but then declined. Circulating levels of bioactive LH were significantly less on days 7 to 9 of the luteal phase than at this stage in the natural cycle. The hCG regimen extended (P less than 0.05) the luteal phase in five of six animals. The hCG treatment elicited a persistent increase (P less than 0.05) in circulating P levels, rather than a transient rise typical of normal or simulated pregnancy in natural cycles. The authors conclude that (1) corpora lutea of hyperstimulated cycles can respond to CG, but (2) there are differences in luteal function during both the luteal phase and simulated early pregnancy that may be due to inadequate luteal development or the abnormal gonadotropin milieu existing after ovulation or both.\r"

  ".W": "Hormonal profiles were compared in 14 ovulatory women who were treated with two different doses of gonadotropins in successive in vitro fertilization cycles. All patients suffered from mechanical causes of infertility. Serum estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone (P) were measured daily during the follicular phase. Women were arbitrarily classified as high responders (E2 greater than 1000 pg/ml on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration, n = 8) or as low responders (E2 less than 1000 pg/ml, n = 6), according to the peak E2 levels during the cycle when they received 3 ampules of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). When patients were treated with 3 ampules of hMG, serum FSH, LH, and P concentrations increased significantly during the follicular phase in high responders but remained unchanged in low responders. When these patients were treated with 2 ampules of hMG, the temporal profiles of the hormones were similar, but the magnitude of increases in serum levels of gonadotropins and sex steroids was significantly reduced in high responders. The authors conclude that temporal individuality of endocrine profiles cannot be altered by varying the dose of gonadotropin. Increases in hormone levels accompanying a high response to hMG can, however, be dampened by lowering the dose. In contrast, hormone concentrations are not influenced by changing the dose of hMG in low responders.\r"

The low plasma AA concentration of diabetic rats can be normalized by dietary AA supplement (20-40 mg/day), a dosage approximately equal to the maximal synthetic rate of this substance in the rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with this regime prevented the decrease in activity of granulation tissue prolyl hydroxylase (PRLase), an AA-dependent enzyme required for maintaining the normal properties of collagen. The decreased plasma AA concentration and granulation tissue PRLase activity in diabetes can also be normalized by the aldose reductase inhibitor tolrestat. We conclude that in diabetic animals there is a true deficiency of AA that may be responsible for some of the changes of collagen observed in diabetes. Treatment with AA or an aldose reductase inhibitor may prevent some of the diabetic complications with underlying collagen abnormalities.\r"

Morphologically, simultaneous treatment with gliadin and swainsonine caused destruction and decreased density of microvilli, as shown by electron microscopy. Neither gliadin nor swainsonine when given alone had significant effects on enterocytic enzyme activities or enterocytic morphology. Binding of enterocytic glycoproteins to both gliadin-Sepharose and concanavalin A-Sepharose was significantly increased in rats treated with swainsonine. Because swainsonine causes the formation of hybrid-type oligosaccharides with a high binding affinity to mannose-specific lectins, the observed alterations of enterocytic maturation and morphology are presumably caused by the increased binding of gliadin to enterocytic glycoproteins. A possible analogy in the etiology of celiac disease is discussed.\r"

All patients had endoscopically proven rectal inflammation. Eicosanoid profiles were determined in rectal dialysates by radioimmunoassay after preliminary purification. Concentrations of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and thromboxane B2, but not 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, were raised in all groups and compared with healthy controls. The highest levels within each group were obtained in patients with widespread epithelial damage, as judged by endoscopy. In patients with ulcerative colitis, an extreme rise in prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 were observed. Similarly, concentrations of leukotriene B4 were substantially increased in ulcerative colitis, but in Crohn's colitis and Clostridium difficile colitis only those patients with rectal ulcerations showed elevations. These findings probably reflect more severe tissue damages in ulcerative colitis, but differences between disease groups in cell-to-cell interaction may also contribute. The data suggest, therefore, that therapeutic inhibition of lipoxygenase pathways may prove more effective in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease.\r"

When a mixture of the 33- and 39-amino acid forms of porcine CCK was infused at 0.1-2.5 pmol/kg.min into normal subjects, material indistinguishable from CCK-8 by gel filtration and in region-specific radioimmunoassays appeared in plasma, together with an intermediate form that eluted between the 33- and 8-amino acid peptides. During infusions, plasma concentrations of CCK-33/39, CCK-8, and the intermediate CCK rose to 63 +/- 26 (mean +/- SE), 57 +/- 12, and 18 +/- 10 pmol/L, respectively. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide appeared rapidly and constituted approximately 40% of total CCK-like immunoreactivity after 5 min of infusion. Octapeptide-like material also appeared, but at a slower rate, when CCK-33 was incubated at 37 degrees C with human plasma. Thus after 5 min, and throughout the incubation, CCK-8 comprised approximately 20% and CCK-33 approximately 75% of total immunoreactivity. Cholecystokinin-33 disappeared more rapidly and small forms appeared in higher concentrations in plasma from patients with acute pancreatitis. Thus, after incubation for 120 min, CCK-33 and CCK-8 comprised 45% +/- 7% and 13% +/- 3% of initial immunoreactivity in normal plasma, but 18% +/- 6% and 33% +/- 9%, respectively, in plasma from patients with pancreatitis. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, but not aprotinin, inhibited the cleavage of CCK-33 to produce CCK-8, and the degradation of CCK-8 in normal plasma in vitro.\r"

Mild phospholipidosis, affecting only hepatocytes, was demonstrated in 3 of the 4 patients receiving parenteral nutrition for less than 5 mo. These findings indicate that liver phospholipidosis is relatively common in patients receiving parenteral nutrition and that the degree of liver phospholipidosis depends on the duration of parenteral nutrition. Liver phospholipidosis might be due to intrahepatic accumulation of intravenous phospholipids provided by fat-emulsion sources.\r"

A single-pass perfusion was performed to determine the effects of infusates on 5 mM valine, aspartic acid, and lysine absorption. Compared with controls receiving luminal saline, prior glutamine infusion increased valine absorption; prior valine, glutamine, and aspartic acid infusion significantly increased aspartic acid absorption; and prior valine and lysine infusion significantly increased lysine absorption. The mixed amino acid solution had no effect. The effects of metabolic balance were examined by comparing fasted rats with parenterally fed and orally fed rats.

Control animals were sham-operated and fed a pelleted diet (group OC). Duodenal villus surface area and mucosal height were significantly greater in group G/F compared with group G. No other differences between the TPN groups were found in small intestinal growth, mucosal protein, deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid content, and disaccharidase activities. As anticipated, group OC demonstrated increased intestinal length, weight, and villous surface area compared with the TPN groups. Ileal sucrase and jejunal and ileal maltase activities were greater in the TPN groups compared with those in group OC. Physiologic changes in serum insulin and the insulin/glucagon ratio induced by the TPN fuel mix do not appear to have altered small intestinal growth, composition, and differentiation in the healthy small intestine.\r"

Liver biopsies from 33 allogeneic marrow transplant recipients with acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease and 37 nontransplant liver disease patients without graft-versus-host disease were recut, restained and coded for blind review. Analysis of individual histologic features showed significantly more cytologic aberration of bile duct epithelium and more cholestasis among biopsies with graft-versus-host disease when compared to biopsies without graft-versus-host disease (p less than or equal to 0.05). The duration of graft-versus-host preceding the biopsy influenced the histologic features. Biopsies before Day 35 showed frequent acidophilic bodies but infrequent bile duct changes. Biopsies from Days 35 to 90 posttransplant had more frequent bile duct exocytosis and disruption, and biopsies from patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (beyond Day 90) showed more frequent portal fibrosis and bile duct dropout. Pattern assessment of coded biopsies showed that a histologic diagnosis of graft-versus-host disease had a positive predictive value of 86%, a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 91%. False-negative diagnoses occurred most frequently in biopsies obtained less than 4 weeks posttransplant, usually because bile duct abnormalities were not present. False-positive diagnoses of graft-versus-host disease occurred in nongraft-versus-host disease biopsies with periportal inflammation and proliferated bile ducts. However, biopsies of chronic graft-versus-host disease had more frequent dropout and disruption of bile duct epithelium than did biopsies of acute or chronic hepatitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During therapy, serum values of DNA polymerase decreased in 6 and became negative in four patients.

Serum aminotransferase levels transiently increased in 6 of the 10 patients during therapy; but once therapy was stopped, levels fell markedly. Side effects of interleukin 2 therapy included fever, chills, anorexia and fatigue. After 1 year of follow-up, three treated patients had lost HBeAg and had marked improvement in aminotransferase levels. These serologic and biochemical improvements occurred 1.5 to 11 months after therapy was stopped. Whether a 3- to 4-week course of interleukin 2 therapy leads to an increased rate of seroconversion from HBeAg to antibody in chronic type B hepatitis deserves further evaluation in prospectively randomized, controlled trials.\r"

  ".U": "88226476\r", 
  ".W": "During biosynthesis of bile acid, carbons 25-26-27 are removed from the cholesterol side chain. Side-chain oxidation begins either with hydroxylation at the 26-position, in which case the three-carbon fragment is released as propionic acid, or with hydroxylation at the 25-position, in which case the three-carbon fragment is released as acetone. In the present study, we have quantitated the relative importance of these two pathways in vivo by measuring production of [14C] acetone from [14C]-26-cholesterol. Four days after intraperitoneal injection of 20 to 40 muCi [14C]-26-cholesterol and 1 day after beginning a constant intravenous infusion of unlabeled acetone at 25 mumoles per kg per min, 6 male and 2 female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent breath collections. Expired acetone was trapped and purified as the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative. 14CO2 was trapped quantitatively using phenethylamine. Specific activity of breath acetone was multiplied times the acetone infusion rate to calculate production of [14C]acetone. [14C] Acetone production averaged 1.7% of total release of 14C from [14C]-26-cholesterol, estimated by 14CO2 output. The method was validated by showing that [14C] acetone production from [14C]isopropanol averaged 111% of the [14C]isopropanol infusion rate. We conclude that, in the normal rat, the 25-hydroxylation pathway accounts for less than 2% of bile acid synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the plasma levels, cardiac release and splanchnic extraction of atrial natriuretic factor in cirrhosis with ascites. The plasma concentration of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor in samples obtained from an antecubital vein was measured in 18 healthy volunteers and in 35 cirrhotics with ascites. In 11 of these cirrhotics and in 11 patients admitted to the hospital for the study of a thoracic pain who had no clinical or hemodynamic signs of cardiac failure (control group), the plasma levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor in samples from the coronary sinus, right atrium, pulmonary artery, hepatic vein and femoral vein were determined and the coronary sinus blood flow measured by thermodilution. Cirrhotic patients showed significantly higher plasma levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor in each vascular territory studied than did control subjects (coronary sinus: 101.2 +/- 10.6 vs. 26.1 +/- 4.7 fmoles per ml; right atrium: 32.5 +/- 5.8 vs. 9.4 +/- 3.5; pulmonary artery: 36.8 +/- 10.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 2.4; hepatic vein: 10.7 +/- 2.0 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.8; femoral vein: 18.2 +/- 2.4 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.9; antecubital vein: 14.7 +/- 1.6 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.8). The coronary sinus blood flow was also higher in cirrhotics (200 + 22 ml per min) than in controls (105 +/- 7 ml per min). Consequently, the estimated cardiac release and cardiac production of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor were strikingly increased in cirrhotics (13,334 +/- 2,007 and 5,484 +/- 1,734 fmoles per min, respectively) as compared to control subjects (1,669 +/- 338 and 1,431 +/- 350 fmoles per min, respectively; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One control group of six cirrhotic patients (volume control) had a calorie-free equivolumic electrolyte solution. The second control group (normal control) of six patients with normal hepatic function had the same test meal. Cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, hepatic venous pressures, hepatic blood flow and azygos blood flow (only measured in the study group) were measured before and 30 and 60 min after the meal. Systemic circulatory responses were generally absent. Hepatic blood flow and wedged hepatic venous pressure increased significantly in both cirrhotic patients and normal controls; however, cirrhotic patients tended to have a quicker response (peaks at 30 min) than normals (peaks at 60 min). Azygos blood flow showed large postprandial variability, but overall did not change significantly. These results demonstrate that the splanchnic circulation of the patient with cirrhosis reacts differently from normals to the physiologic stimulus of a meal, and in particular appears to have precocious vasoactive reactivity.\r"

Rabbit erythrocytes were suspended by centrifugation in a stream of fluid and exposed to transient injections of an extracellular indicator (125I-albumin or 22Na+), a water indicator (3H2O), and H14CO3- and/or 14CO2. Diffusion of indicators into erythrocytes was judged by comparison of initial concentrations of diffusible and extracellular indicators in the elutriator outflow. It was possible to conduct these experiments at normal hematocrits because any carbonic anhydrase released from erythrocytes by hemolysis was washed away in the elutriator flow, and ambient pH, PO2, and PCO2 were kept constant by the inflow of fresh fluid. Equilibration of HCO3- with erythrocytes was complete during the 7- to 10-s transit time through the chamber. After this exchange was irreversibly inhibited by the anion exchange inhibitor, DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid), addition of carbonic anhydrase (100 mg/dl) accelerated exchange, but acetazolamide (20 mg/dl) was without effect. These observations were consistent with the absence of carbonic anhydrase on the surface of the erythrocytes.\r"

Relaxation in response to isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2, and forskolin was significantly decreased after inhibition of the Na-K ATPase by ouabain or a potassium-free medium, but relaxation to sodium nitroprusside was not affected. Relaxation to isoproterenol was greater in muscles contracted by 5-hydroxytryptamine than in those contracted by acetylcholine. The stimulation of Na-K ATPase activity with potassium also caused differences in relaxation between tissues contracted with 5-hydroxytryptamine or acetylcholine. Relaxation caused by isoproterenol by activation of the Na-K-ATPase was also decreased by the Ca2+-channel antagonists, verapamil and diltiazem. The results suggest 1) Na-K ATPase activity modulates relaxation caused by isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2, and forskolin in canine tracheal smooth muscle, 2) isoproterenol or activation of the Na-K ATPase may cause relaxation partly by reducing Ca2+ influx through potential-dependent Ca2+ channels, and 3) the differences in the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol and Na-K ATPase activity on muscles contracted by acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine could be due to differences between these contractile agents in their dependence on extracellular Ca2+ for activation.\r"

  ".W": "The present study compared the responses of rib cage and abdominal expiratory muscles to chemical and mechanical stimuli. In pentobarbital-anesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, electromyograms (EMG) were recorded from the triangularis sterni (TS) and transverse abdominis (TA) muscles using bipolar intramuscular wire electrodes. During resting oxygen breathing, both muscles were electrically active during expiration. Progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia significantly augmented the expiratory activity of both the TA and the TS. However, the mean percent increases in electrical activity in response to CO2 were substantially greater for the TA than for the TS at all PCO2 levels greater than 50 Torr (P less than 0.01). Occlusion of the airway at end inspiration significantly delayed the onset of TS EMG (from 0.35 +/- 0.07 to 3.35 +/- 0.67 sec; P less than 0.002) and decreased TS EMG rate of rise (P less than 0.002), but did not significantly alter these parameters for the TA. Esophageal distension increased TS EMG in all dogs (by mean of 220 +/- 64%; P less than 0.01), but in contrast decreased TA EMG in all dogs (by a mean of 63 +/- 12%; P less than 0.001). The response to esophageal distention occurred in a graded manner and appeared to be mediated predominantly via vagal afferents. We concluded that expiratory muscles of the rib cage and abdomen manifest substantial differences in their electrical responses to chemoreceptor, pulmonary stretch receptor, and esophageal mechanoreceptor stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Solution of the model by iterative calculation closely predicted 1) the empirical maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) for Bufo, 2) variation in empirical VO2max for three other genera (Rana, Xenopus, Scaphiopus), and the empirically observed effects on VO2max of 3) hypobaric hypoxia, 4) artificially induced anemia, and 5) beta-blockade of heart rate increment with activity. The model indicates that cardiovascular transport is the rate-limiting step to VO2max in amphibians and that an increase in circulatory O2 transport is a major physiological adaptation for increasing total aerobic capacity. CO2 transport and body fluid PCO2 values were primarily determined by pulmonary ventilatory capacity, and to a lesser extent by cardiovascular transport. The model should be generally applicable to other terrestrial vertebrates.\r"

  ".U": "88228401\r", 
  ".W": "Peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) was initially isolated from the porcine gastrointestinal tract and may be present in the brain. It has been suggested that PHI may be PRL-releasing hormone (PRH) because of its potent PRL-releasing activity and its existence in hypophysial portal plasma in rats. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and PHI are coded by the same gene, and human PHI has a C-terminal methionine instead of isoleucine [peptide histidine methionine (PHM)]. To investigate the possibility that PHM is a physiological PRH in humans, we measured the immunoreactive PHM concentration in human hypothalamic tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a specific RIA. We also examined in vivo the PRH activity of synthetic PHM. The human hypothalamus contained 19.3 +/- 6.2 (+/- SD; n = 5) pmol/hypothalamus, very similar to the content of GHRH or CRH. Immunoreactive PHM was also present in CSF; its levels in CSF were significantly lower in patients with prolactinomas than in control subjects. The CSF PHM levels in such patients increased after correction of hyperprolactinemia by long term bromocriptine therapy. The CSF PHM levels also were low in pregnant women. There was a significant negative correlation between plasma PRL and CSF PHM levels in all of these subjects. Gel filtration profiles of CSF extracts from normal subjects revealed two peaks of immunoreactive PHM: a high mol wt peak and one at the elution position of synthetic PHM. This profile resembled that of hyppothalamic extract. In contrast, only high mol wt material was detected in CSF from hyperprolactinemic subjects. Intravenous administration of synthetic PHM elicited a significant increase in plasma PRL in normal subjects; the responses to PHM were higher in women than in men. The presence of large amounts of immunoreactive PHM in the human hypothalamus suggests that PHM may participate in the regulation of anterior pituitary hormone secretion. Its specific PRL-releasing activity in vivo and the low CSF PHM levels of hyperprolactinemic subjects suggest that PHM may be a physiological PRH in humans.\r"

Their diet contained 130 mmol sodium and 75 mmol potassium daily. The mean supine plasma irANP levels were similar on days 2, 4, and 9 of placebo treatment [25 +/- 10 (+/- SE), 27 +/- 5, and 27 +/- 6 pmol/L, respectively]. Mean plasma irANP levels were 76 +/- 42 (P less than 0.05), 89 +/- 34, and 93 +/- 29 pmol/L (P less than 0.01), respectively, on days 2, 4, and 9 during 9 alpha F administration, and 68 +/- 37 (P less than 0.05), 83 +/- 41, and 48 +/- 18 pmol/L on the same days during prednisone administration. Compared with the placebo period, sodium intake minus urinary output during 9 alpha F administration averaged +41 mmol at the time of blood sampling on day 2, +112 mmol on day 4, and +149 mmol on day 9; body weight was unchanged on day 2 and increased by 0.7 and 1.1 kg on days 4 and 9, respectively. Escape from 9 alpha F-induced renal sodium retention occurred on days 5 and 6. During prednisone administration, sodium intake minus urinary output and body weight did not change. Plasma volume and BP rose significantly during 9 alpha F (P less than 0.05) but not during prednisone administration. Plasma renin, aldosterone, and norepinephrine (NE) decreased during 9 alpha F treatment (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.01); during prednisone treatment, plasma aldosterone levels were lower on day 9 only. Cardiovascular pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II was enhanced during 9 alpha F but not prednisone administration, while blood pressure reactivity to NE was not significantly modified. These findings demonstrate that 9 alpha F and prednisone in high doses provoke remarkably similar increases in plasma irANP, but that the glucocorticoid-induced rise in plasma irANP is due to a mechanism other than sodium and volume retention.\r"

V1 receptor-mediated functions (increase in urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion and plasma cortisol levels) and Gs (guanine nucleotide-binding stimulatory protein) activity of erythrocyte membranes were normal in both patients. After infusion of 0.4 micrograms/kg dDAVP, a 57-yr-old male patient had no increase in plasma factor VIII coagulant, ristocetin cofactor, or fibrinolytic activity or change in von Willebrand factor multimers. In addition, he had no vasodilatory response to dDAVP, a response that occurs in normal subjects and patients with central diabetes insipidus. In contrast, a 25-yr-old female patient had normal hemostatic and vasodilatory responses to the infusion of dDAVP. These observations indicate that the cellular abnormalities in patients with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may be either at the V2 receptor or in the postreceptor (and Gs activity) cascade of events that mediate vasopressin-induced antidiuresis. Therefore, heterogeneity exists in the biochemical cause(s) of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in man.\r"

Specific binding of [125I]GHRHa to adenoma cell membranes was maximal within 20 min at 24 C, remained stable for 60 min, and was reversible in the presence of 500 nmol/L human GHRH-(1-44)NH2 (hGHRH). The specific binding increased linearly with 10-160 micrograms cell membrane protein. This binding was inhibited by 10(-11)-10(-6) mol/L hGHRH in a dose-dependent manner, with an ID50 of 0.20 nmol/L, but not by 10(-7) mol/L vasoactive intestinal peptide, glucagon, somatostatin-14, somatostatin-28, TRH, LHRH, and CRH. The specific binding of [125I]GHRHa to the membranes was saturable, and Scatchard analysis of the data revealed an apparent single class of high affinity GHRH receptors in five adenomas from acromegalic patients; the mean dissociation constant was 0.30 +/- 0.07 (+/- SE) nmol/L, and the mean maximal binding capacity was 26.7 +/- 7.0 (+/- SE) fmol/mg protein. In three nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, GHRH receptors were not detected. The plasma GH response to hGHRH (100 micrograms) injection was studied in four acromegalic patients before surgery. Plasma GH levels increased variably in response to hGHRH injection in all four patients. However, there was no correlation between the characteristics of the tumor GHRH receptors and plasma GH responsiveness in these patients. We conclude that pituitary GH-secreting adenomas have specific GHRH receptors. Exogenously administered GHRH presumably acts via these receptors, but the variations in plasma GH responsiveness to hGHRH in these patients cannot be directly related to the variations in binding characteristics of the GHRH receptors on the GH-secreting adenoma cells.\r"

  ".W": "A method for culturing cells from human pituitaries obtained at autopsy for studies of the secretion of gonadotropins and other hormones is described. The EC50 of GnRH-stimulated LH secretion from human pituitary cells was 1.25 nmol/L, similar to that found with rat pituitary cells (2.45 nmol/L). The GnRH agonist (D-Ala6, N alpha MeLeu7, Pro9-NEt)GnRH was 10-fold more active in stimulating LH release from both human and rat pituitary cells (EC50, 0.21 and 0.35 nmol/L, respectively). The GnRH antagonists (Ac-D-Nal(2)1,D-alpha-Me-4-ClPhe2,D-3-Pal3,D-Arg6,D-Ala10 )GnRH and (D-pGlu1,D-Phe2,D-Trp3,6)GnRH both inhibited 3 nmol/L GnRH-stimulated LH release from human pituitary cells (IC50, 2.40 and 78.6 nmol/L, respectively) with potencies similar to those observed in the rat (IC50, 0.68 and 33.0 nmol/L, respectively). Stimulation of the human pituitary cells with 100 nmol/L GnRH for 44 min resulted in biphasic release of LH and FSH. The initial phase occurred during the first 4 min of stimulation, and the second protracted plateau phase continued for at least the ensuing 40 min. The kinetics of LH and FSH release were identical, with no evidence of differential release at any stage. GnRH-stimulated LH and FSH secretion was Ca2+ dependent. The presence of 3 mmol/L EGTA prevented the gonadotropin response to GnRH, and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 stimulated release of both LH and FSH. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate also stimulated gonadotropin secretion, indicating that activation of protein kinase-C is able to elicit LH release. GnRH desensitized the cells to subsequent stimulation with GnRH. After initial 2-h incubation with 0.1-100 nmol/L GnRH, LH release during a second 2-h incubation with the same doses was reduced by 50-100%. The reduction in FSH ranged from 63-92%. Depletion of gonadotropin pools may contribute to desensitization, since total LH and FSH cell content decreased 48% and 49%, respectively, after 100 nmol/L GnRH stimulation for 4 h. We conclude that functionally active cells can be cultured from human pituitaries obtained postmortem and that the mechanism of GnRH action and the relative potencies of GnRH analogs closely parallel those in the rat.\r"

Processing of the large forms could be mimicked by treatment with pepsin, which increased their immunoreactivity 15- to 20-fold (iNT) and 1- to 2-fold (iNMN), liberating a peptide similar to NMN and 2 fragments of NT [primary product, NT-(4-13)]. Biochemical characterizations using gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and high pressure liquid chromatography indicated that the large forms were highly basic (pI 8.5-9.5) proteins with a mol wt of about 20K (78% of the total), 45K (8%), and 60K (4%). The 20K protein contained iNT and iNMN in a 1:1 ratio, while a slightly smaller species contained only NMN. These results are in agreement with cDNA studies of canine intestinal mRNA, indicating the presence of a 170-amino acid precursor containing 1 copy each of NT and NMN. They further indicate that within this tumor differential processing of precursor occurred, resulting in a NT to NMN ratio of about 3:1, with additional NMN stored in large molecular forms.\r"

In the present investigation, we studied the effect of a new calcium antagonist, gallopamil, on allergic bronchial reactivity and compared it to that of cromolyn sodium. Nine asymptomatic subjects with ragweed hypersensitivity and a history of bronchial asthma were studied on 4 different days, without and after pretreatments with aerosolized placebo, gallopamil (10 mg), or cromolyn sodium (20 mg) solution, in a single-blind, randomized, crossover design. Bronchial reactivity was measured as the cumulative provocative dose of ragweed antigen in breath units (PD35) that caused a 35% decrease in specific airway conductance (SGaw). Baseline SGaw was comparable on control, placebo-, gallopamil- and cromolyn sodium-treatment days. The airway deposition dose of gallopamil and cromolyn sodium was calculated at 1.05 mg and 2.1 mg, respectively. Neither cromolyn sodium nor gallopamil had a significant effect on mean SGaw. Mean +/- PD35 on control and placebo-treatment days was 0.54 +/- 0.95 and 0.23 +/- 0.17 breath units, respectively. Aerosolized gallopamil and cromolyn sodium increased the mean PD35 to 56 +/- 41 and 24 +/- 35 breath units, respectively (p less than 0.05). Gallopamil completely inhibited the antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in six (67%) subjects, whereas cromolyn sodium was totally effective in two of the nine (22%) subjects. These results demonstrate that aerosolized gallopamil inhibits allergic bronchial reactivity with efficacy comparable or better than cromolyn sodium.\r"

  ".W": "The role of eosinophils in allergic and hypersensitivity diseases has yet to be fully established and remains limited by techniques to isolate the eosinophil in high purity. Consequently, most studies that evaluate and characterize eosinophil function are conducted with isolates from patients with hypereosinophilia. There is, however, evidence to suggest that isolates from such patients do not represent normal function. Now, with new techniques to isolate and purify eosinophils from normal subjects without eosinophilia, metabolic function of the normal eosinophil can be assessed. To accomplish this, granulocytes from healthy volunteers were separated by continuous density Percoll gradients into populations of purified eosinophils (90.3 +/- 1.9%) and neutrophils (98.2 +/- 0.4%). Superoxide (O2-) generation was measured with a microassay of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction in response to several soluble and particulate agonists. Normal eosinophils generated significantly more O2- in response to either phorbol myristate acetate or calcium ionophore A23187 than their matched neutrophil fractions. In contrast, differences in granulocyte response to zymosan and chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, were dependent on the presence of cytochalasin B (CB) in the reaction. N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated eosinophils generated less O2- in the absence of CB but similar amounts in the presence of CB, compared to neutrophils. Activation by zymosan in the presence of 10% autologous serum generated similar amounts of O2- in all the cell populations when CB was present; however, in the absence of CB, neutrophils produced less O2- when they were compared to eosinophils. Therefore, normal eosinophils respond differently to some activators, compared to neutrophils, and these differences may prove significant as the contribution of eosinophils to inflammation becomes established.\r"

Cromolyn or placebo were administered by turboinhaler 20 minutes before 10 minutes of SO2 exposure at 1.0 ppm during continuous moderate exercise on a treadmill. The exercise level that was chosen did not in itself produce bronchoconstriction. The cromolyn doses were 0 (placebo), 20, 40, and 60 mg. Pulmonary functions (FEV1, and total respiratory resistance) were measured before and after drug administration and after exposure. SO2 exposure after placebo produced significant bronchoconstriction. Pretreatment with 20 mg of cromolyn did not change the SO2 response, 40 mg significantly inhibited the response, and 60 mg completely abolished the pulmonary function changes. These results demonstrate for the first time a dose-response inhibition of SO2-induced bronchoconstriction in atopic subjects within a clinically acceptable dosage range and complete obliteration of SO2 sensitivity in this group with 60 mg of cromolyn pretreatment.\r"

In controlling hay fever symptoms all medications were superior to placebo; the glucocorticoids were more effective than was cromolyn sodium. Chest symptoms in the 58 patients with a history of asthma were also relieved by the topical nasal treatment. Various explanations for the beneficial effect of topical nasal treatment in asthma symptoms are conceivable. We consider the most likely to be improvement of nasal airway function. With restoration of the filtering action of the nose, less allergen would penetrate to the intrathoracic airways because of reduction in mouth breathing.\r"

The pharmacologic modification of immediate and late-phase reactions was evaluated for procaterol (beta 2-agonist), cromolyn sodium, and prednisolone. Histamine levels were noted to rise in patients who had a dual response of a mild to moderate nature, but did not change in patients who had severe asthma. During exercise challenge cromolyn sodium inhibited both immediate and late-phase reactions but also inhibited plasma generation of NCA. Prednisolone, on the other hand, did not affect immediate reactions, but blocked late-phase reactions to exercise and also decreased NCA generation. Procaterol inhibited the generation of LTD4 and also inhibited NCA when compared with placebo. Exercise challenge did not alter levels of plasma histamine or of LTB4 or LTC4.\r"

The provocative test primarily affects the nasal airway but also may affect the adjacent organs, including the eustachian tube, middle ear, sinuses, and lower respiratory tract. Recent advances in the measurement of nasal airway resistance with microcomputer-assisted rhinomanometry have improved the objective assessment of nasal airway obstruction. Eustachian tube obstruction has been shown after nasal provocation by a new procedure, sonotubometry, which can be performed in series with rhinomanometry and pulmonary spirometry. As will be described these procedures have helped elucidate the extent and pathophysiology of diseases affecting the upper airway, especially allergic rhinitis. At present, nasal provocation is primarily a clinical investigative test. It is anticipated that with further development and refinement, it can be used to a greater extent in the diagnosis and management of nasal diseases.\r"

Patients whose physician followed the recommendation in the registered dietitian's assessment showed a statistically significant benefit in tolerance of the TF in comparison with those patients who received no assessment or those whose physician ignored the recommendation (p less than .05, chi-square test). Average time to meet nutritional requirements via TF was 4 days in patients with nutrition recommendations incorporated into their care vs. 7 in those patients without nutrition assessments.

Additional information about a small but representative sample of patients was obtained from consultant pharmacists by mail questionnaire. Of approximately 35,000 residents, there were 1,046 receiving long-term, full-dose H2RAs during 1984 at a cost of +405,848. No differences were noted between treated patients and the overall LTCF population by gender, age, level of care, or geographic locality. Among 387 patients receiving therapy for the last 3 months of 1984, over one half received antacids and over 20% received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concurrently. According to survey respondents, almost one half of the patients had no diagnosis amenable to treatment by H2RAs. Diagnostic procedures conducted within 30 days prior to the initiation of H2RAs were hemoglobin/hematocrit assessment (performed on 53% of patients), stool testing (34%), radiological exam (23%) and endoscopy (8%). The results suggest that there is widespread use of long-term full-dose H2RAs in LTCFs for undocumented, inappropriate, and poorly supported diagnoses. Such findings are of concern to all persons charged with monitoring drug use in nursing homes because of the implications for both quality and cost of care. Information from this study will be used in designing a program to reduce inappropriate utilization of H2RAs, and Medicaid claims data will be used to monitor trends in utilization.\r"

Plasma ANP levels in nine patients without heart diseases were significantly (P less than .01) higher than in the ten young, healthy subjects (mean +/- SD, 46.0 +/- 22.0 vs 22.1 +/- 6.3 pg/mL) and a significant positive correlation was observed between ANP level and age in these subjects (r = 0.60, P less than 0.01). Plasma ANP levels in 60 patients with heart diseases (158.4 +/- 158.5 pg/mL) were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than in nine patients without heart diseases. Plasma ANP levels in patients with congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation were 285.8 +/- 185.2 or 223.0 +/- 185.9 pg/mL, respectively; each of these values was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than in patients without heart diseases. In three patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, plasma ANP levels during atrial fibrillation were three times greater than when atrial fibrillation returned to normal sinus rhythm (377.3 +/- 78.5 vs 101.1 +/- 68.5 pg/mL). These results indicate that plasma ANP levels increase with advancing age, and that increased ANP levels are associated with various heart diseases in elderly subjects, possibly through stretch of the atrial wall.\r"

  ".W": "A comparative study of the phenotype and immune functions of highly purified CD8+CD4- T cells obtained from the spleen and thymus of normal mice and from the spleen of athymic nude mice was conducted. Of seven individual normal and nude mice examined, the range of V beta 8+ cells among CD8+ T cells was a heterogeneous 4.3 to 30.5% for athymic nude mice and a much more uniform spread from 14.7 to 18.5% for normal mice. In six of the seven nude mice examined, the fraction of V beta 8+ cells was below the lower limit of the V beta 8 distribution in normal mice. However, one of the seven nude mice contained nearly twice the percentage of normal V beta 8+ cells. A reduction in the density of V beta 8 as well as CD3 Ag expression was also observed in athymic CD8+CD4- cells although an Ly-6-linked Ag, B4B2 displayed a highly increased expression. Considering the battery of Ag analyzed in entirety, athymic CD8+CD4- T cells were clearly distinct from their \"counterpart\" CD8+CD4- T cells isolated from either thymus or spleen of normal (euthymic) mice. Anti-CD3-mediated triggering of the TCR:CD3 complex caused extensive clonal proliferation in cultures to which single responding CD8+ T cells had been deposited. Under identical conditions, however, anti-CD3 caused little, if any clonal expansion in CD8+ cells from athymic nude mice. Highly purified athymic CD8+CD4- cells produced readily detectable IL-2R expression and IL-2 synthesis and secretion upon stimulation by anti-CD3 and by Con A. Production of IL-2 by purified athymic CD8+CD4- cells was due to CD8+CD4- cells and not due to a minor population of contaminating CD8- cells as anti-CD8 + C treatment completely abrogated the ability of athymic CD8+CD4- cells to produce IL-2. Despite IL-2 production and IL-2R expression by athymic nude CD8+CD4- T cells in response to anti-CD3 and to Con A, an impaired proliferative response followed.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of mAb directed at the CD3 molecular complex (64.1) to induce T cell-dependent B cell proliferation and differentiation was examined. Coculture of B cells with mitomycin C-treated T4 cells (T4 mito) stimulated by immobilized 64.1 resulted in marked B cell proliferation and Ig-secreting cells (ISC) generation in the absence of any additional stimulation. The magnitude of the B cell responses induced by immobilized 64.1-stimulated T4 mito was far greater than that induced by other stimuli, such as Staphylococcus aureus plus factors produced by mitogen-activated T cells, PWM, or soluble 64.1. The induction of maximal B cell responsiveness required direct contact between activated T cells and responding B cells. Of note, immobilized 64.1 also induced B cell proliferation and ISC generation in the presence of mitomycin C-treated T8 cells. By contrast, immobilized 64.1 stimulated T4 or T8 cells that had not been treated with mitomycin C induced very modest ISC generation and suppressed B cell responses supported by T4 mito even in the presence of exogenous IL-2 or factors produced by mitogen-activated T cells. The interactions between T and B cells in these cultures not only induced B cell responses, but also enhanced the production of IL-2 by activated T cells. Increased IL-2 production was facilitated when culture conditions afforded the opportunity for contact between B cells and activated T cells. These results indicate that the establishment of interactions between B cells and anti-CD3-stimulated T4 or T8 cells provides all of the signals necessary for proliferation and differentiation of B cells without other stimuli and also augments the production of lymphokines by the activated T cells. The data emphasize the role of Ag-nonspecific interactions between B cells and T cells in promoting polyclonal responses of both cell types.\r"

IFN-gamma has been shown to induce expression of class I and class II MHC molecules on endothelial cell cultures from umbilical cord. We could detect these Ag by FACS analysis when endothelial cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 200 to 1000 U/ml of rIFN-gamma. Among the class II MHC molecules, HLA-DR and -DP but not -DQ were consistently induced. Addition of rIFN-alpha-D/A to IFN-gamma-treated cells inhibited the expression of class II MHC but not class I MHC molecules. Furthermore, the inhibition was more pronounced when IFN-alpha-D/A was added before or simultaneously as IFN-gamma. Natural IFN-alpha also exhibited similar inhibition and its suppressive effect was abolished in the presence of anti-IFN-alpha antibody. On the contrary, dexamethasone, a known inhibitor of class II MHC molecules on murine macrophages, showed a slight enhancing effect on class II MHC Ag. These results suggest an immunoregulatory role for IFN-alpha on non-lymphoid cells and that controlling elements for expression of class II MHC molecules may be different on various cell types as well as species.\r"

  ".W": "The EBV-producing B lymphoblastoid cell line B95-8 was found to efficiently activate the alternative C pathway whether assessed with Mg-EGTA-treated human serum or with mixtures of the purified proteins of the pathway (PAP). The ability of the cells to activate was markedly increased after stimulation of EBV replication by treatment of the cells with a phorbol ester, and decreased by treatment of the cells with a viral polymerase inhibitor. Alternative pathway activation was dependent on the presence of either properdin or EBV-immune IgG; the addition of either alone to the PAP led to the deposition of 200,000 C3 molecules/cell. The addition of both properdin and immune IgG to the PAP markedly increased C3 binding to a level of 800,000 molecules/cell. Several lines of evidence indicate that the major external glycoprotein of EBV, gp350, mediates alternative pathway activation by B95-8 cells. First, the ability to activate C positively correlated with gp350 expression on the surface of the EBV-producing cells and gp350- cells failed to activate; second, the anti-EBV antibody in immune human sera which enhanced activation specifically immunoprecipitated gp350 from membranes of B95-8 cells; third, a significant proportion of the C3 which became bound to the cells during activation was attached either to gp350 or to the anti-gp350 antibody found in immune human sera; and fourth, purified gp350, as well as EBV, efficiently activated the alternative pathway. These results indicate that gp350, an EBV envelope glycoprotein, is an efficient alternative pathway activator and its expression on cell membranes is associated with the ability to activate C.\r"

The basis for this restriction is unknown but in order to characterize it further, we obtained serum preparations containing one single subclass by using subclass-specific mAb in affinity chromatography. Subsequently we determined the affinity of antibodies in the four IgG subclasses for gp30/p25, a hepatitis B surface Ag (HBsAg) complex, for a nine-amino acid cyclical peptide representing residues 139 to 147 of HBsAg, and for a peptide representing residues 126 to 140 of the hepatitis B virus pre-S2 region and the relative avidity of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies for purified pneumococcal polysaccharide type 3. Affinities to the HBsAg showed a clear pattern of decreasing affinity in the order IgG1 greater than IgG2 greater than IgG3 greater than IgG4 both in sera from vaccinated and from naturally infected individuals. The relative avidities of antibodies to the polysaccharide Ag had a reverse pattern, IgG2 greater than IgG1. In individuals with or without Ig H chain gene deletions where the anti-HBsAg response was restricted to one subclass, the affinity was similar to that observed for the same subclass in sera from individuals who in addition possessed high or low affinity antibodies of other subclasses.\r"

Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoate phorbol-13 acetate (20 nM), calcium ionophores, A23187 (2 microM) or ionomycin (1 microM), or serum-treated zymosan (300 micrograms) resulted in production of cyclooxygenase (CO) metabolites, 6-keto-PG-F1 alpha, thromboxane-B2, PGE2, PGF2 alpha, PGD2, PGB2, 12-L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid; 15-lipoxygenase products, including 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE); and unmetabolized AA. Labeled 5-lipoxygenase (LO) products, 5-HETE, and leukotriene-B4 were detected only after exposure to ionophore or serum-treated zymosan. The calcium dependence of 5-LO activation was confirmed in experiments where calcium was omitted from the incubation medium, and EGTA (0.5 mM) was added, as well as by direct measurement of increased intracellular calcium in phagocytosing monocytes. Combined or sequential treatment with two stimuli increased the release of unmetabolized AA without a commensurate augmentation of labeled metabolites, indicating that release of CO and LO metabolites does not necessarily reflect the extent of phospholipase activation. Quantitation of individual eicosanoids by RIA confirmed results by using radionuclides. These studies show the following. Activation of human monocyte phospholipase may be regulated by at least two pathways, one \"12-O-tetradecanoate phorbol-13 acetate-like,\" which is largely independent of calcium, and another which is mediated by increased intracellular Ca2+ (\"ionophore-like\"). \"Physiologic\" stimulation of monocyte arachidonate release, such as that seen accompanying phagocytosis of opsonized particles, may occur via either a calcium-sensitive or calcium-insensitive pathway or both. Calcium may regulate eicosanoid formation at the level of phospholipase or 5-LO. Free AA, CO products, and 12- or 15-LO products are ordinarily released after phagocytosis, but leukotriene-B4, 5-HETE, or other 5-LO metabolites are produced only under conditions where calcium concentrations are optimal.\r"

  ".W": "The functional role of mast cells in rheumatoid synovium was investigated by assessing the ability of mast cell tryptase to activate latent collagenase derived from rheumatoid synoviocytes. Tryptase, a mast cell neutral protease, was demonstrated in situ to reside in rheumatoid synovial mast cells, by an immunoperoxidase technique using a mouse mAb against tryptase, and in vitro to be released by dispersed synovial mast cells after both immunologic and nonimmunologic challenge. Each rheumatoid synovial mast cell contains an average of 6.2 pg of immunoreactive tryptase and the percent release values of this protease correlated with those of histamine (r = 0.58, p less than 0.01). The ability of purified tryptase to promote collagenolysis was demonstrated in a dose-dependent fashion using latent collagenase derived from rheumatoid synovium, synovial fluid, IL-1-stimulated cultured synoviocytes, and partially purified latent collagenase derived from conditioned media, with between 10 and 92% of the collagen substrate degraded. [3H] Collagen, treated with tryptase-activated latent collagenase, was subjected to electrophoresis on SDS polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography showed the collagen degradation pattern (A, B) characteristically produced by collagenase. Mast cell lysates also activated synovial latent collagenase yielding 24% digestion of collagen substrate. This activator in mast cell lysates could be inhibited by diisopropylflurophosphate or by immunoadsorption of tryptase. Thus, mast cells may activate metalloproteinases and play a role in the catabolism of collagen that occurs in rheumatoid synovium.\r"

The killing properties of platelets were shown previously to involve specific IgE after their binding to a membrane receptor. More recently, we have demonstrated that lymphokines released by S. mansoni Ag- or lectin-stimulated CD4+/CD8-T cells were able to induce the platelet cytotoxicity. The isoelectric focusing of the T lymphocyte supernatants showed that two factors were able to stimulate the platelet killing functions. One of them was clearly identified as being IFN-gamma. The present work demonstrates that the second lymphokine was TNF. Indeed the rTNF-beta and, to a lesser extent, rTNF-alpha, induce normal platelets into killer cells for the young larvae of schistosome. Moreover, an additive effect of the TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma has been observed.\r"

To characterize the T cell requirement for successful defense against L. donovani, nude mice were first reconstituted with unfractionated nu/+ immune spleen cells, which readily conferred the capacity to control and eliminate visceral (hepatic) L. donovani. In reconstituted mice, acquired resistance was paralleled by the ability of spleen cells to generate high levels of leishmanial Ag-stimulated IFN-gamma and the development of well formed liver granulomas. In contrast, nude mice reconstituted with either L3T4+- or Lyt-2+-enriched immune spleen cells alone failed to control visceral parasite replication and did not develop effective granulomas despite the finding that transfer of L3T4+ cells largely and Lyt-2+ cells partially restored the capacity to secrete IFN-gamma. To determine whether both T cell subsets were also required in a normal host, nu/+ BALB/c mice were treated with cell-depleting anti-L3T4 and anti-Lyt-2 mAb. Depletion of either T cell subset inhibited the acquisition of resistance to L. donovani and impaired the tissue granulomatous response. Thus, successful T cell-dependent host defense towards intracellular L. donovani and the tissue expression (granulomas) of this mechanism appear to require both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells. A primary role for the L3T4+ cell may be IFN-gamma production; the role of the Lyt-2+ cell and the precise interaction of the two T cell subsets remain to be identified.\r"

Activation of alveolar macrophages with IFN-gamma is dose dependent; significant inhibition of L. pneumophila multiplication (mean 1.60 +/- 0.20 logs) is achieved consistently with concentrations of IFN-gamma of greater than or equal to 2 x 10(-2) micrograms/ml (220 U/ml). Activation of alveolar macrophages is also time dependent. In macrophages treated continuously after explantation, macrophages infected at 48 to 96 h after explantation are more inhibitory than macrophages infected at 24 h after explantation. In macrophages not treated continuously after explantation but treated for various lengths of time before infection, the longer their exposure to IFN-gamma before infection, the greater the inhibition of L. pneumophila multiplication (96 greater than 72 greater than 48 greater than 24 h). IFN-gamma-activated alveolar macrophages exhibit morphologic signs of activation, including increased size, spreading, and aggregation. This paper demonstrates that a human resident macrophage can be activated with IFN-gamma such that it exhibits enhanced antimicrobial activity against a relevant pathogen.\r"

Presumably, all or most of the functional VH gene segments must be chosen by the population of B lymphocytes if the organism is to express the diversity that is observed in the immune system. Control of the selection of a VH gene segment for expression is not understood. We have found that the members of the VH gene family closest to the constant genes, the 7183 family, are transcribed in a manner that is specific for the stage of B cell development after pre-B cells derived from spleens of 6- to 8-wk-old nude mice are induced to differentiate in vitro by a mixture of dendritic cells and mitogen-activated T lymphocytes (DC-T). DC-T from spleens and lymph nodes induce transient high levels of synthesis of RNA from the 7183 VH family, whereas DC-T from Peyer's patches of mice of the same age as those from which spleen and lymph node DC-T were prepared did not induce the expression of RNA from that gene family. Spleen and Peyer's patch DC-T induce secretion of similar total amounts of antibody. Therefore, the RNA synthesis from members of at least one VH gene family is specific both for the lymphoid tissue in which B cell differentiation occurs and for the developmental stage of the B lymphoid cells.\r"

Stable transfectants of lymphomas (early stage, microseconds less than or equal to micron) and a plasmacytoma (late stage, microsecond much greater than micron) produce the anticipated levels of microsecond and micron mRNA. Transcription termination between the microsecond and micron poly(A) sites occurs only in the plasmacytoma transfectants, and appears to be the rate-limiting step in the production of the final steady state microsecond/micron mRNA ratio. We propose that as the B cell becomes terminally committed to secretion, the mechanism responsible for the regulation of the steady state microsecond/micron mRNA ratio shifts from exclusively post-transcriptional to predominantly transcriptional termination.\r"

  ".W": "Human and murine class II genes of the MHC show a striking homology 50 to 120 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This area is composed of two conserved sequences (a 13-mer and an 8-mer separated by 19 to 20 bp). Recently, these conserved sequences have been identified as cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements. We have sought nuclear factors that bind specifically to an upstream fragment (-245 to +75 bp) of the murine I-A beta chain gene that contains the conserved sequences by application of a modified gel electrophoresis DNA binding assay. We report here the identification of a nuclear factor whose binding site overlaps the 8-mer conserved sequence. This factor is present in murine B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, mastocytes, fibroblasts, and human B lymphocytes and macrophages. The binding site was defined by using DNase I and dimethylsulfate protection assays. The putative binding sequence is closely related to the sequence, CCAAT, which is often found associated with the promoter of a gene and is recognized by the transcriptional factors CCAAT-binding transcription factor and nuclear factor I. Oligonucleotides that contain the binding site sequences for nuclear factor I and the alpha-globin CCAAT element, however, do not compete for binding of the nuclear factor to the sequence identified here, suggesting that, in spite of the similarity of the binding sequence, the nuclear factor identified in this report may be different. This nuclear protein may be one of the trans-acting factors that mediate transcription of class II genes.\r"

We show that line 1, a murine lung carcinoma cell line, has low levels of class I Ag (H-2K, D, and L) because it is deficient in both class I and beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) RNA, and that these mRNA can be coordinately induced with DMSO. Evidence presented herein also shows that IFN-gamma can induce surface expression of class I Ag and suggests that it may act through a different mechanism than DMSO in inducing class I Ag. To further evaluate the regulation of class I expression, H-2Dp genes were transfected into line 1 cells. The transfected H-2 genes appear to be constitutively expressed at much higher levels than are the endogenous class I genes because surface expression of the foreign Dp Ag on the transfectants is elevated relative to the endogenous H-2d haplotype class I Ag. Both Dp surface expression and Dp mRNA are induced after treatment with DMSO. In all the Dp transfectants, we observed higher constitutive levels of class I mRNA as well as increased constitutive levels of endogenous B2M mRNA when compared to control or untransfected line 1 cells, however, we could not correlate these constitutive levels with Dp copy number. These results suggest that the regulation of class I and B2M genes is linked and that expression of class I genes can affect the expression of B2M genes.\r"

Comparison of the derived amino acid sequence with those of other HLA class I proteins showed JTW15 to be the most divergent HLA class I gene identified so far, the level of sequence homology being lowest for the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains. The JTW15 gene transcript was found in a broad variety of cell types and was inducible in cells treated with IFN-gamma.

This mAb was alum precipitated and injected i.p. before or after carrier priming. Results show that spleen cell helper activity is markedly inhibited by anti-IFN-gamma mAb injection. This inhibition is time and dose dependent, and counteracted by IFN-gamma administration. Thus, the anti-IFN-gamma mAb appears to inhibit helper cell activity by neutralization of the IFN-gamma required for the antibody response. Moreover, AN 18.17.24 mAb injection results in increased activation of Lyt-2+ T cells which markedly suppress Th activity. These findings altogether indicate that besides the activation of macrophages and Th, IFN-gamma seems to exert a negative interference in suppressor T lymphocyte circuits and, as a consequence, to inhibit immunosuppression.\r"

  ".U": "88229118\r", 
  ".W": "Monospecific T cell clones have been proven to be powerful tools for the characterization of T cell recognition in many Ag-specific as well as allo-specific T cell responses. In this report, in order to elucidate the mechanism of T cell recognition of minor stimulating locus Ag (Mlsc) determinants, Mlsc-specific cloned T cells were employed together with primary T cell responses to clarify the role of MHC-gene products in Mlsc-specific T cell recognition. The results indicated that T cells recognize Mlsc determinants in conjunction with I-region MHC gene products. Moreover, certain MHC haplotypes (e.g., H-2a and H-2k) appear to function efficiently in the \"presentation\" of Mlsc, whereas other haplotypes (e.g., H-2b and H-2q) function poorly if at all in presenting Mlsc. Experiments with the use of stimulators derived from F1 hybrids between the low stimulatory H-2b, Mlsc strain, C3H.SW, and a panel of Mlsb, H-2-different or intra-H-2 recombinant strains strongly suggested that expression of E alpha E beta molecules on stimulators plays a critical role for Mlsc stimulation. The functional importance of the E alpha E beta product in Mlsc recognition was further demonstrated by the ability of anti-E alpha monoclonal antibody to inhibit the response of cloned Mlsc-specific T cells. Inhibition of the same Mlsc-specific response by anti-A beta k antibody suggests that the A beta product may also play a role in T cell responses to Mlsc.\r"

If the high frequencies of autoantibodies result from testing procedures, equally high frequencies would be expected for foreign Ag specificities detected in the same manner. The presence of specific autoantibodies was confirmed in this study by the disparate frequencies observed for antibodies reactive with individual Ag. The frequencies were highest for autoantigens associated with SLE, indicating a bias toward autoreactivity in the preimmune repertoire.

However, 125I-labeled IL-2 binding experiments demonstrated that 1400 to 2800/cell IL-2 binding sites with a single affinity (K: 0.46-1.4 nM) were expressed on LGL from the four patients. The affinity was not high but about 10-fold higher than that of the low affinity IL-2R expressed on activated normal T lymphocytes. Furthermore, LGL from the four patients proliferated in response to higher concentrations of IL-2 and these responses were not inhibited by an excess amount of anti-Tac antibody. 125I-Labeled IL-2 cross-linking studies performed in two cases revealed the predominant expression of an IL-2 binding molecule with an estimated Mr of 70,000 to 75,000. After the culture with IL-2 for 48 h, expression of a small amount of Tac Ag (p55) was induced on LGL in at least three cases. These data strongly suggested that the IL-2R expressed on LGL is functional and identical to the p70, a novel IL-2 binding peptide that has been recently identified and speculated to form the high affinity IL-2R in association with the p55.\r"

The expression of HLA-DR Ag on Hs294T cells was induced by rHuIFN-gamma in a dose- and time-dependent manner with maximal levels obtained with 10 ng/ml rHuIFN-gamma after 48 h exposure. Treatment of Hs294T cells with natural porcine platelet-derived or human rTGF-beta 1 (1 to 100 ng/ml) in the presence of rHuIFN-gamma (0.1 to 10 ng/ml) reduced the percentage of cells positive for this Ag by approximately 40 to 50%, as determined by flow cytometry. This suppressive effect of TGF-beta 1 was not restricted to Hs294T cells inasmuch as rHuIFN-gamma induced HLA-DR surface Ag expression on PBMC-derived adherent cells was also significantly inhibited by TGF-beta 1. Northern blot analysis of cytoplasmic RNA extracted from Hs294T cells indicated that the decreased levels of HLA-DR cell-surface Ag correlated with decreased levels of mRNA transcripts encoding this Ag. TGF-beta 1 also effectively reduced the levels of HLA-DR mRNA in 1) cells that had been pretreated with rHuIFN-gamma and were expressing maximal levels of HLA-DR surface antigen and 2) cells that constitutively expressed HLA-DR surface Ag without exogenous rHuIFN-gamma treatment.\r"

Supernatants from growth-positive wells were screened for their ability to block binding of 125I-IFN-gamma to human placental membranes. Ten inhibitory cultures were identified. Two of these (GIR-208 and GIR-301) abrogated all binding of radioligand to either intact placental membranes or soluble, purified IFN-gamma R. Three others (GIR-72, 76 and 94) showed moderate blocking activity (65, 59, and 49%, respectively) whereas the remaining five (GIR-57, 67, 83, 109, and 153) blocked binding to a low but significant extent (20 to 40%). Specificity experiments demonstrated that the antibodies reacted with the receptor and not the ligand (IFN-gamma). None of the antibodies reacted with IFN-gamma by ELISA. Moreover, GIR-208 and GIR-301, but not isotype-matched controls, identified the receptor by Western blot analysis. GIR-208 and GIR-301 also completely abrogated binding of 125I-IFN-gamma to either mononuclear phagocytes (U937) or human fibroblasts (WISH). Competition experiments revealed that GIR-208 and GIR-301 recognized similar epitopes on the IFN-gamma R and that these (or this) epitopes were identical to or linked to the ligand binding site of the receptor. In addition, both antibodies inhibited development of IFN-gamma-dependent anti-viral activity in WISH cells in a dose-dependent fashion. These data thus indicate that the IFN-gamma R expressed on human placental cells, mononuclear phagocytes, and fibroblasts are similar.\r"

We have recently shown that IL-1 induces its own gene expression and, in the present studies, we have examined the effect of IFN-gamma on IL-1-induced IL-1 production. Whereas IFN-gamma increases the total amount of IL-1 (extracellular and cell-associated) produced after endotoxin stimulation of human PBMC, in the same cultures, IL-1-induced IL-1 production was markedly (greater than 70%) reduced in the presence of IFN-gamma. We observed this inhibition in the PBMC from over 40 human donors by employing non-cross-reacting RIA for either IL-1 beta or IL-1 alpha. IFN-gamma inhibited IL-1 beta-induced IL-1 alpha as well as IL-1 alpha-induced IL-1 beta production; furthermore, this inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma was unaffected by indomethacin. The ability of 100 U/ml of IFN-gamma to inhibit IL-1-induced IL-1 production was comparable to that accomplished by 10(-7) M dexamethasone. In contrast to its effect on IL-1 production from PBMC, IFN-gamma had no effect on the proliferative responses of T cells to IL-1. We conclude that IFN-gamma down-regulates synthesis of total IL-1-induced IL-1 production but up-regulates endotoxin-induced IL-1 production. These studies may explain the ameliorating effects of IFN-gamma in experimental models of IL-1-induced bone and cartilage degradation, in peritoneal fibrosis, and in patients with diseases associated with increased IL-1 production.\r"

The active component that inhibited proliferation at high concentrations of these supernatants appeared to be IFN-gamma based on the following findings: 1) the biphasic pattern of responsiveness correlated with the presence of IFN-gamma in the supernatants; 2) an anti-IFN-gamma mAb augmented the proliferation of D10 cells to these supernatants; 3) rIFN-gamma inhibited profoundly the response of D10 cells stimulated with rIL-1 plus supernatant from activated D10 cells or with rIL-1 plus rIL-4; 4) the response of D10 cells to rIL-1 plus rIL-2 also was inhibited by rIFN-gamma, although to a lesser extent. The proliferation of an additional Th2 clone stimulated with rIL-1 plus rIL-4 or rIL-2 also was inhibited by rIFN-gamma, implicating IFN-gamma as an inhibitory lymphokine for Th2 cells in general. rIFN-gamma did not affect the proliferation of two Th1 clones, nor did it affect the proliferation of an unconventional HTL clone which produces both IL-4 and IFN-gamma and proliferates in response to IL-2 or IL-4 in an IL-1-independent fashion. The proliferation of D10 cells stimulated by Ag or by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody also was blocked by rIFN-gamma, whereas IL-4 production in response to these stimuli was unaffected, indicating that proliferation and not general cell function was specifically inhibited. Collectively, these data implicate IFN-gamma as a suppressive factor for the proliferation of the subset of HTL designated Th2, and suggest that the relative amounts of the various lymphokines present during an immune response may direct which T cell types increase in number.\r"

  ".W": "The types and distributions of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans within developing chick bursae of Fabricius were determined by indirect immunocytochemical analyses using mAb specific for chondroitin/dermatan sulfate epitopes. Analyses obtained from the use of well characterized mAb known to specifically identify chondroitin 4- and dermatan sulfates (antibody 2B6) and chondroitin 6-sulfate (antibody 3B3) were compared with those obtained from two additional mAb raised against chick chondroitin sulfates proteoglycans derived from hemopoietic tissue. The results indicate that chondroitin sulfate compositions of the adjacent lymphopoietic and granulopoietic compartments differ. Chondroitin 6-sulfate, notably absent from lymphopoietic regions, is a major chondroitin sulfate species in granulopoietic regions of day 13 bursae. Moreover, chondroitin 6-sulfate disappears from the granulopoietic compartment in a time course that corresponds to the decline in granulopoietic activity. Simultaneously, there is an apparent increase in chondroitin sulfates associated with developing medullary regions of lymphoid follicles. The content of chondroitin 4-/dermatan sulfates and, most significantly, of chondroitin/dermatan sulfates identified by antibodies raised against chick proteoglycans, increases within developing follicles. As a consequence, by day 18 of incubation, immunostained follicles become clearly demarcated from the connective tissue of the tunica propria. This study provides evidence that chondroitin sulfates are constituents of both lymphopoietic and granulopoietic microenvironments and that subtle changes occur within these proteoglycan structures during bursal development. These developmental changes in chondroitin sulfate compositions are consistent with these molecules playing a functional role in hemopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "A polypeptide homologous to human and mouse J chain has been identified in the high molecular weight (HMW) Ig of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. In previous studies, we had detected a component that was similar in size to mammalian J chains and that, relative to L chains, migrated rapidly to the anode in alkaline-urea PAGE; however, its mobility was less than that of mammalian J chains. We now demonstrate that this component is covalently linked to the H chain of R. catesbeiana HMW Ig. All of the disulfide bridges of this polypeptide, like those of human and mouse J chain, can be cleaved by reducing agents even in the absence of denaturing solvents. The putative frog J chain was isolated by a procedure that did not require preliminary purification of the HMW Ig. The chain differed in amino acid composition from L chains but resembled J chains from several other species. Tryptic peptides were isolated and sequenced. Except for a single heptapeptide, the peptides could be aligned by virtue of their similarity to segments of human and mouse J chain. Of the 116 residues that were placed, 55 were identical with residues in human J chain and 60 with residues in mouse J chain. The six cysteine residues identified in the frog J chain are at the same positions as six of the eight cysteines in the human and mouse J chains. The results indicate significant conservation in structure between amphibian and mammalian Ig J chains.\r"

Here, we examined the properties of neutrophil priming by GM-CSF and other growth factors such as human rTNF and granulocyte CSF. Although GM-CSF has a negligible direct effect on [3H]arachidonic acid release, it enhances or \"primes\" neutrophils for three- to fivefold increased release of [3H]arachidonic acid, induced by 1.0 microM A23187 and the chemotactants FMLP, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (all 0.1 microM). The priming effects of GM-CSF were concentration- and time-dependent (maximum 100 pM, 1 h at 23 degrees C), and consistent with the determined dissociation constant of the human GM-CSF receptor. Indomethacin (10(-8) M), cycloheximide (100 micrograms/ml), and pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml, 2 h at 37 degrees C) had no effect on GM-CSF-, A23187, or platelet-activating factor-induced [3H]arachidonic acid release. The lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, however, totally abolished A23187-induced [3H]arachidonic acid release from both diluent- and GM-CSF-treated neutrophils. Consistent with this observation, we found that GM-CSF-pretreated neutrophils synthesize increased levels of LTB4 after stimulation with A23187 and chemotactic factors. GM-CSF enhances neutrophil arachidonic acid release and LTB4 synthesis, and thereby may amplify the inflammatory response to chemotactic factors and other physiologically relevant stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant murine IFN-gamma (rMu-IFN-gamma) was demonstrated to be a potent in vivo activator of mouse peritoneal macrophages to kill Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and to be capable of conferring protection against death from acute T. cruzi infection. Following i.p. injections of rMu-IFN-gamma, resident peritoneal macrophages were cultured and infected with T. cruzi in vitro. Numbers of intracellular parasites were determined at different times thereafter. Ten or 100 micrograms (1 microgram = 6.5 X 10(5) U) of Mu-IFN-gamma, injected both 24 and 4 h before macrophage harvest, induced up to 99% inhibition of T. cruzi. One microgram of rMu-IFN-gamma was not effective under these conditions. In vitro inhibition of T. cruzi by peritoneal macrophages occurred by 24 h after infection and continued until at least 120 h after infection. There were no significant differences in initial parasite uptake by macrophages from IFN-gamma-treated or control mice, indicating that the rMu-IFN-gamma induced parasite killing. One i.p. dose of 10 micrograms was as effective as two doses if the single injection was given 24 h before macrophage harvest. In subsequent experiments, mice were given multiple injections of 10 micrograms rMu-IFN-gamma beginning 24 h before or 2 h after infection with virulent T. cruzi. Mice treated with rMu-IFN-gamma had significantly lower parasitemias and decreased morbidity compared with control mice. Proliferative responses to Con A and antibody responses to SRBC were not significantly lowered in IFN-gamma-treated mice, in contrast to untreated infected controls. All of the IFN-gamma-treated mice survived acute T. cruzi infection, whereas 100% of saline-treated infected mice died. It was demonstrated in this study that rMu-IFN-gamma activated mouse macrophages in vivo to kill T. cruzi and that rMu-IFN-gamma significantly reduced morbidity and immune suppression, and eliminated mortality resulting from acute infection with this parasite.\r"

  ".W": "We have selected and cloned variant cells from the murine B cell lymphoma, CH12, that produce a variety of other Ig isotypes in addition to or in place of the original IgM and IgD. Variants were selected by flow cytometry and automated cloning and isotype production was analyzed by membrane immunofluorescence and ELISA of culture fluids. Variants have been isolated that produce the single isotypes IgA, IgG2b, and IgG3, as well as variants that produce more than one isotype simultaneously, i.e., IgM, IgD, and IgA; IgG2b and IgA; IgG3 and IgA. All isotypes have been seen as cell surface proteins and all except IgD have been found in culture supernatants. All isotypes display the same idiotype and Ag-binding specificity for phosphatidyl choline as the original IgM and all are translated from the same VDJH and VJ kappa gene assemblies. Production of more than one isotype by a variant clone is due to simultaneous production of all the isotypes by each cell within the clone. The finding that the variants producing more than one isotype are all tetraploid suggests the interesting possibility that each isotype is derived from an independently switching chromosome. All isotype variants can be stimulated by LPS to secrete the appropriate Ig isotype at an increased rate similar to the IgM expressing parent. The variants differ in stability; some have remained stable for more than 9 months in culture, whereas other have undergone further isotype switching. The facts that some isotypes have not been seen, that multistep switching has occurred, and that many variants produce IgA in addition to another isotype are discussed in relation to current notions of isotype switching mechanisms.\r"

Analyses of PC-reactive clonotypes generated in limiting dilution culture, as well as analyses of PC-specific hybridomas, indicate that this strain expresses L and H chain V regions not previously associated with high affinity murine PC-binding antibodies. Further, sequence analyses suggest gene conversion events occurred within the S107VH gene family among the progenitors of this strain subsequent to their divergence from those of most common laboratory strains.\r"

  ".W": "Pretreatment of human K562 leukemia cells with rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma resulted in decreased susceptibility to lysis by human peripheral blood NK cells. The reduction of NK-susceptibility after IFN treatment was not due to a general effect of IFN on the stability of the cell membrane because the susceptibility of K562 cells to lysis by antibodies plus C, distilled water, or lysolecithin was unaffected. Binding studies with effector cell preparations enriched for NK cells with large granular lymphocyte morphology revealed no difference in binding to control and IFN-gamma-treated target cells. The sensitivity to soluble NK cytotoxic factors was not affected significantly by the IFN treatment. In contrast, the susceptibility of IFN-treated target cells to the cytotoxic activity of purified cytoplasmic granules from a rat large granular lymphocyte tumor was significantly reduced, indicating that the IFN-induced resistance acted at the level of susceptibility to the lytic mechanism of NK cells. However, IFN-alpha was more effective than IFN-gamma in inducing resistance to the cytoplasmic granules although resulting in only a weak resistance in the cell-mediated cytotoxic assay. IFN-gamma but not IFN-alpha caused a reduction in the frequency of effector cells that had reoriented their Golgi apparatus toward their bound target cell. In addition, IFN-gamma treated K562 cells failed to elicit an influx of Ca2+ into effector cells. Taken together, the results suggest that IFN-gamma in addition to an increased resistance to the lytic molecules released by NK cells can also induce changes in the target cells which prevent the triggering and activation of the effector cell.\r"

In contrast, PA activity in epidermis from lesions of patients with a variety of cutaneous diseases was predominantly tissue type enzyme with a much smaller contribution from urokinase. Our patient population included individuals with benign chronic pemphigus, pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceous, bullous pemphigoid, or psoriasis. Using rabbit antibody specific for tissue type PA, we have immunocytochemically localized this enzyme in lesions from individuals with the above disorders. Our results indicate that tissue PA is consistently elevated in cutaneous lesions with diverse etiology, pathology, and clinical presentation.\r"

In incised mouse skin wounds u-PA immunoreactivity was found in keratinocytes at the edge of the wound after 12 h, and at days 2 to 10 after wounding it was found in virtually all keratinocytes of the epithelial outgrowth that gradually covered the wound. At day 14, the epidermis appeared normal and no u-PA immunoreactivity was detected. t-PA immunoreactivity was found from day 5 to day 10 in some keratinocytes located superficially in the epidermal outgrowths near the edge of the mouse wounds. In 3- and 5-day old human skin wounds, u-PA immunoreactivity was found in keratinocytes in the epithelial outgrowths, whereas no t-PA immunoreactivity was detected. No u-PA and no t-PA immunoreactivity was found in normal mouse and human epidermis. The specificity of the staining was supported by a variety of controls, including absorption of the polyclonal antibodies with highly purified u-PA and t-PA preparations and zymographic analysis of extracts of wound tissue. The function of the plasminogen activators during reepithelialization is discussed and it is suggested that the keratinocytes use plasmin activated by u-PA for dissecting their way through the provisional matrix in the upper part of the granulation tissue.\r"

Purified mast cells obtained from rat peritoneal cavity were irradiated with UVB and subsequently exposed to a degranulator, compound 48/80, or the calcium ionophore A-23187. The amount of histamine released from mast cells measured by the enzyme isotopic assay was significantly decreased by UVB irradiation (100-400 mJ/cm2). Within this dose range, UVB alone was not cytotoxic to the cells because it did not induce histamine release. The suppression was observed when mast cells were subjected to degranulation without intervals after UVB irradiation, and even after 5 h postirradiation. The wavelength of 300 nm from a monochromatic light source showed the maximum effect. When mast cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonate were irradiated and challenged by compound 48/80, label accumulation in diacylglycerol produced by the phosphatidylinositol cycle was considerably decreased by UVB irradiation. From these results, we hypothesize that, within an adequate irradiation dose, UVB irradiation suppresses histamine release from mast cells, probably by causing noncytotoxic damage to the membrane phospholipid metabolism, which is tied to the degranulation mechanisms.\r"

UPA in keratinocyte conditioned medium is not susceptible to inhibition with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), and it has an apparent molecular weight of 55 kD under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Cleavage of keratinocyte uPA by plasmin results in the formation of a 96 kD complex comprised of activated uPA and PA inhibitor 2. PA extracted from normal human epidermis is only partially inhibited by DFP, suggesting that precursor uPA is also present in vivo. The synthesis of uPA as a precursor with reduced enzymatic activity as well as decreased affinity for inhibitors is likely to be a mechanism by which normal epidermis regulates plasminogen activation in vivo.\r"

Cells from each of the 4 lines contained high affinity binding sites for 1,25(OH)2D3. At high cell densities, binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 was diminished due to a decrease in receptor number with no apparent change in affinity. Preincubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10(-10) to 10(-8) M) increased tyrosinase activity 1.3- to 3.2-fold and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase activity 1.4- to 10-fold. Human calcitonin (0.82 to 82.5 ng/well) raised the intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate 1.4- to 9.4-fold. Tyrosinase activity increased in response to calcitonin in 2 of the cell lines, decreased in the third, and showed no change in the fourth. Human parathyroid hormone (1-34) in concentrations of 1 to 10 ng/ml produced no significant changes in cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation, cell numbers, or tyrosinase activity in any of the cell lines. This study indicates that the phenotype of human melanoma cells can be modulated by the calciotropic hormones 1,25(OH)2D3 and calcitonin.\r"

Because vitamin D3 is known to be photochemically converted from pro-vitamin D3 in the skin by ultraviolet irradiation, the mechanism of human skin pigmentation after ultraviolet irradiation, thus far unknown, may be at least partly explained by this stimulating effect of vitamin D3 on melanocytes.\r"

Because arachidonic acid release and metabolism are components of neutrophil activation by certain stimuli, we questioned whether neutrophils depleted of arachidonate as a result of essential fatty acid deficiency might be functionally impaired. We examined this possibility by producing essential fatty acid deficiency in monkeys with lipid-free total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Rhesus and African green monkeys were given calorically equal TPN for up to 23 days with and without a vegetable fat emulsion rich in linoleic acid. Fatty acids were analyzed in total lipid extracts of serum and isolated blood neutrophils by gas-liquid chromatography. Although fatty acids in the serum and neutrophils of monkeys given TPN with lipid did not change, linoleic acid levels decreased by at least 60% in serum and 50% in neutrophils from animals given TPN with no lipid. Moreover, arachidonate levels in neutrophil lipids decreased by at least 50% within 12 days of lipid-free TPN, and the abnormal fatty acid 20:3 omega 9 (characteristic of essential fatty acid deficiency) appeared and steadily increased with time. These biochemical signs of omega 6 fatty acid deficiency were associated with impaired neutrophil function in vitro. Both migration responses and superoxide generation stimulated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine were significantly decreased by 12 days of lipid-free TPN, as was the capacity of activated cells to synthesize leukotriene B4. In contrast, functional responses of fatty acid-deficient neutrophils to leukotriene B4 and phorbol myristate acetate, which have little or no effect on arachidonate release or metabolism, were not significantly altered. These findings indicate that endogenous supplies of arachidonic acid and other essential omega 6 fatty acids influence the functional responsiveness of neutrophils. These studies also indicate that altered neutrophil function is a feature of essential fatty acid deficiency and that it may contribute to the increased risk of infection and decreased inflammatory responses observed in this condition.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrinolysis dependent on the release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) can only be explored after stimulation eliciting the release of t-PA from endothelial cells. The choice of the stimulus and test assay is of utmost importance in discriminating patients at risk for persistent thrombosis and in identifying acquired or genetic abnormalities of t-PA synthesis or release from endothelial cells in pathologic conditions. The present study was designed to compare the efficacy and reproducibility of the fibrinolytic response to desmopressin acetate (deamino-8-D-argininevasopressin) (DDAVP) by use of various routes of administration with the response to the venous occlusion test. Nine healthy male volunteers were randomly administered intravenous desmopressin acetate, intranasal drops and intranasal spray. The results from tests of euglobulin lysis time, t-PA activity, t-PA antigen levels, and t-PA fast-acting inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI]) level were compared with those obtained after venous occlusion. The only test that elicited the release of free t-PA activity in the circulation in all volunteers was the intravenous administration of 0.4 microgram/kg desmopressin acetate, and the most reliable test assay was t-PA activity measured in the euglobulin fraction of plasma. Intravenous desmopressin acetate induced the release of large amounts of t-PA in most cases and caused a significant fall in PAI. Other routes of administration of desmopressin acetate, along with venous occlusion, identified many nonresponders who proved to be false negative. The relevance of these data was demonstrated in a study in nine patients with thromboembolic phenomenon or related disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The majority of volunteers responded with an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to both the toxin A and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) components of the vaccine. Maximal titers to both vaccine components were seen 42 days after immunization. Antibody levels remained elevated for at least 14 months after vaccination. The anti-LPS IgG response was predominantly within the IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses, whereas the antitoxin A response was within the IgG1 subclass. There was a gradual elevation of IgG4 antitoxin antibody, with maximal levels seen at 14 months after immunization. No concomitant IgG4 antibody rise to LPS was observed. Immunization evoked a vigorous IgA1 and IgA2 antibody response to LPS, which was long-lived. Only a modest, transient IgA antitoxin A response was noted. Both antitoxin A--neutralizing and opsonic antibodies were elicited by immunization and remained elevated over the 14-month postimmunization period studied.\r"

Blood samples from victims dying of injury or disease other than infection were examined to determine whether the postmortem interval, bacterial contamination, anticoagulants, or delay in testing would result in false positive assays. Series 1 samples, collected so as to minimize bacterial contamination, were immediately submitted for assay. Series 2 evaluated the effect of adverse conditions of collection, anticoagulation, and prolonged sample storage. Despite extended postmortem intervals of up to 14 days, heavy bacterial contamination, prolonged storage at 4 degrees C, deep hemolysis, and presence of anticoagulants, false positive assays were seldom observed.\r"

Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) ranged from 16 to 126 torr and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) from 14 to 72 torr. Linear correlation analysis (100 paired values) of PtcO2 versus PaO2 showed an r value of 0.75 with a regression equation of PtcO2 = 8.59 + 0.905 (PaO2), while PtcCO2 versus PaCO2 revealed a correlation coefficient of r = 0.89 with an equation of PtcCO2 = 2.53 + 1.06 (PaCO2). The bias between PaO2 and PtcO2 was -2.8 with a precision of +/- 16.0 torr (range, -87 to +48 torr). The bias between PaCO2 and PtcCO2 was -5.1 with a precision of +/- 7.3 torr (range, -34 to +8 torr). The transcutaneous sensor detected 83% of hypoxia (PaO2 less than 45 torr), 75% of hyperoxia (PaO2 greater than 90 torr), 45% of hypocapnia (PaCO2 less than 35 torr), and 96% of hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than 45 torr). We conclude that the reliability of the combined transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2 monitor in sick neonates is good for detecting hypercapnia, fair for hypoxia and hyperoxia, but poor for hypocapnia. It is an improvement in that it spares available skin surface and requires less handling, but it appears to be slightly less accurate than the single electrodes.\r"

Important factors such as sampling flow rate, water removal, exhaust gas scavenging, measurement interference, calibration, the effect of water vapor, and measurement chamber cleaning are described as part of this process. The value of the data displayed, once derived, is based on the knowledge that carbon dioxide is an end product of the metabolism of oxygen-consuming organisms.

We compared several variables for PEEP optimization--oxygen transport, total respiratory system compliance, FRC-based compliance, mixed venous oxygen saturation, end-tidal to arterial carbon dioxide tension difference, and arterial oxygen saturation--by producing four different PEEP levels, 0, 5, 10 and 15 cm H2O, in 24 mongrel dogs in which pulmonary injury was produced. The data were regressed versus PEEP by using analysis of variance for regression. Venous admixture (F1,23 = 149.3; P less than 0.0001), end-tidal to arterial carbon dioxide tension difference (F1,23 = 64.9; P less than 0.0001), and oxygen transport (F1,23 = 95.1; P less than 0.0001) decreased linearly with PEEP. FRC (F1,23 = 248.1; P less than 0.0001) and arterial oxygen saturation (F1,23 = 66.9; P less than 0.0001) increased linearly with PEEP.

Four weeks after implantation, catecholamine histofluorescence revealed many transplanted catecholamine cells in the cortex. However, no fibers extended from the transplanted tissue to the cerebral cortex. In a second group of rats which had been pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine (a specific neurotoxin to the catecholamine neuron), some showed extension of catecholamine fibers to the cerebral cortex. To simulate an animal model of Parkinson's disease, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine) was administered to five monkeys. Two weeks after MPTP administration, dopamine terminals in the caudate nucleus disappeared. After autotransplantation of the SCG into the caudate nucleus of these monkeys, many of the transplanted SCG cells extended axons beyond the graft into the caudate nucleus. These results show that transplanted SCG cells survived well in the brain. Under special circumstances, such as a shortage of catecholamine in the brain, implanted SCG cells extended their axons into the brain. It is suggested that autotransplantation of SCG grafts may be a new therapy for Parkinson's disease.\r"

Murine monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) directed against Fisher Immunotype 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a nonmicrobial, nonmammalian haptene, p-arsanilic acid, were labeled with 125I by the lodogen-Bead method. Unilateral, deep thigh infections were created by innoculation with 2 X 10(8) Fisher Immunotype 1 P. aeruginosa. Twenty-four hours later, one of the radiolabeled antibodies was injected intravenously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg (100-150 microCi). Serial gamma imaging was then carried out beginning at 4 hr and at approximately 24-hr intervals thereafter. Beginning as early as 4 hr postinjection, the area of inflammation could be visualized with either the specific or nonspecific Mab, with the images continuing to intensify until 24-48 hr postinjection. At 48 hr, the contrast between lesion and background with the nonspecific Mab began to fade, while the contrast in the specific Mab-generated images continued to intensify until approximately 192 hr postinjection. Clear-cut differentiation between specific and nonspecific Mab-generated images was possible by 72 hr postinjection. We conclude that specific immune imaging of localized infection with Mab's directed against specific microbial antigens is possible and should be clinically useful. In addition, images created by the localization of immunoglobulin non-specifically at the site of inflammation in the first 24-48 hr postinjection may also provide useful information as to the anatomic location of hidden abscesses.\r"

  ".W": "The early stages of microvascular injury are often difficult to detect due to the lack of a suitable marker to assess such an injury. We utilized the well known phenomenon of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) migration to the microvascular bed as a result of acute inflammatory reactions originating from the damaged cells. A radiotracer technique was developed, employing indium-111-labeled PMN for the detection of microvascular injury induced by hyperoxia. New Zealand white rabbits exposed to either 100% oxygen or air for various intervals of time were injected with indium-111-tropolone or oxine-labeled PMNs. Influx of radioactive PMN into the lung was detected in 72 hr/oxygen-exposed animals using gamma scintigraphic technique. Analysis of dry/wet ratios and histological examinations of the lung biopsies indicated noncardiogenic edema formation at this stage. Mortality was 50% beyond 96 hr/oxygen exposure. Our study thus provided a means to detect early microvascular injury during 72 hr/oxygen-exposure, which was not detectable by any other noninvasive techniques. The use of indium-111-labeled PMN thus appears to be a potentially important tool for the clinical assessment of lung microvascular injury.\r"

Effect of diet on rate of desaturation of eicosatrienoic acid (20:3 omega 6) and lipid composition of liver microsomal membranes was examined. The desaturation of 20:3 omega 6 to arachidonic acid (20:4 omega 6) was higher in rats fed linseed oil and lower in rats fed fish oil than in control animals fed the beef tallow diet. The desaturation of 20:3 omega 6 was lower in rats fed beef tallow or linseed oil diets supplemented with cholesterol than in the respective unsupplemented diet. Inclusion of 2% (wt/wt) cholesterol in the fish oil diet failed to affect synthesis of 20:4 omega 6 from 20:3 omega 6. These in vitro changes in delta 5-desaturase activity are consistent with the diet-induced alterations observed in the fatty acid composition of microsomal membranes. Both free cholesterol and cholesterol ester in the microsomal membrane were higher in rats fed beef tallow or linseed oil diets supplemented with exogenous cholesterol than in the respective unsupplemented diet, and only free cholesterol was higher in rats fed the fish oil diet supplemented with cholesterol. Feeding fish oil appears to prevent both the inhibition of 20:4 omega 6 biosynthesis and the accumulation of cholesterol ester that were apparent when 2% cholesterol was added to either beef tallow or linseed oil diets.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to improve the antitumor efficacy of bleomycin, the effects of the oxygen-carrying emulsion Fluosol-DA and increased levels of inspired oxygen were tested in the mouse FSaIIC fibrosarcoma system. The dose-dependent cytotoxicity of bleomycin toward the FSaIIC cells in vitro was significantly decreased under hypoxic conditions, but it increased in a 95% O2-5% CO2 (carbogen) atmosphere as compared with the cytotoxicity of bleomycin in normally oxygenated cells. Investigations on the FSaIIC tumor in vivo also demonstrated that growth delays induced by bleomycin (10 mg/kg ip given on days 6, 10, 13, and 16) were significantly increased when one of the following treatments was given with each bleomycin injection: carbogen breathing for 2 hours (4.7 days), carbogen breathing for 6 hours (5.7 days), and breathing 3 atm of hyperbaric oxygen (6.3 days) versus normal air (3.3 days). When Fluosol-DA (12 mL/kg iv) was administered just before each bleomycin injection, the following growth delays were produced: 4.8 days with air breathing, 14.6 days with carbogen breathing for 2 hours, 14.9 days with carbogen breathing for 6 hours, and 19.7 days with breathing 100% O2 at 3 atm for 1 hour. Excision studies on the FSaIIC tumor also demonstrated that the cytotoxicity increased approximately fivefold when Fluosol-DA and carbogen breathing for 2 hours were combined with a single treatment with 10 mg of bleomycin/kg. In contrast, no measurable bone marrow toxicity was evident with this combined regimen. These results suggest that the use of Fluosol-DA plus carbogen breathing could add substantially to the clinical antitumor effects of bleomycin.\r"

We studied resource consumption and age for a large group of urology patients under Diagnostic Related Group reimbursement. Total hospital costs (exclusive of Diagnostic Related Group reimbursement. Total hospital costs (exclusive of physician fees) for the 1,281 urology patients studied were $8,895,264. Older urological patients consumed a disproportionately larger share of hospital resources. Mean hospital cost per patient, mean number of procedures, hospital length of stay and mortality generally increased with age. Under Diagnostic Related Group reimbursement, financial risk increased with age; patients 75 years and older generated significant financial risk to the hospital. Older patients often had a more intense resource use as measured by emergency or surgical intensive care unit admission, and blood and plasma protein requirements. These findings suggest that the current Diagnostic Related Group payment scheme may provide significant financial disincentives to hospitals vis-a-vis older urology patients and, thus, it could limit the access and quality of care for the older urology patient in the future.\r"

  ".W": "From a large number of potentially effective androgen withdrawal regimens including bilateral orchiectomy, estrogens, antiandrogens and LHRH agonists alone or in combinations, we compared the ability of 12 different treatment options to mimic the acute results of surgical castration on the rat prostate. Agents were administered s.c. in clinical doses to groups of male rats daily for three days. On day 4 the prostatic tissue was removed and analyzed by conventional methods for whole-tissue and nuclear concentrations of dihydrotestosterone, nuclear androgen receptor and cytoplasmic androgen receptor. Castration-like changes were most pronounced with the synergistic combinations of cyproterone acetate + low-dose diethylstilbestrol, and megestrol acetate + low-dose diethylstilbestrol. Comparing the effectiveness of single agents, low-dose diethylstilbestrol was superior to cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, flutamide, leuprolide and RU23908. Leuprolide combined with flutamide was superior to leuprolide + cyproterone acetate, leuprolide + cyproterone acetate + low-dose diethylstilbestrol or leuprolide + RU23908 after three days of administration; however, this advantage disappeared when the treatments were extended to seven days. The observations indicate that the most potent androgen withdrawal therapies such as cyproterone acetate + low-dose diethylstilbestrol and megestrol acetate + low-dose diethylstilbestrol at best approximate but do not surpass the early effects of surgical castration. During the same time course, other regimens are characterized by a slower onset of action and a lesser degree of suppression of androgenic mechanisms within the cell.\r"

  ".W": "In the first experiment, histological changes of urinary bladder after long-term transvesical catheterization were evaluated in normal rats. No malignant changes of the bladder epithelium were detected in the two and four-week catheterization groups. However incidences of papilloma and papillary carcinoma developed in three of the five rats (60%) in the eight-week group. In a second experiment the therapeutic effect of continuous or intermittent administration of MMC on bladder carcinogenesis in rats treated with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) was examined. MMC at a total dose of four mg. was administered for two weeks in both therapeutic groups. Continuous infusion was performed transvesically using an osmotic pump and a silicone catheter, on the basis that preliminary examination revealed the urinary delivery rate of MMC was constant for two weeks. In the intermittent group, MMC solution was instilled transurethrally with a venural catheter twice a week. The continuous infusion of low concentrated MMC reduced significantly (p less than 0.02) the incidence of tumor development in spite of extended catheterization (for eight weeks) into the bladder. However, the intermittent instillation of high concentrated MMC hardly inhibited the development of bladder tumors. We should consider the optimal concentration and time of a drug in intravesical chemotherapy based on the above findings.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have reported that alpha difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), has anti-tumor activity in several tumor systems. Recently, investigations have revealed that combinations of DFMO and Interferon (IFN) are synergistic in inhibiting tumor cell growth. We tested the effects of DFMO and IFN alpha, beta alone and in combination on the growth of mouse bladder tumor (MBT-2) cells both in vitro and in vivo. MBT-2 cells were incubated for 72 hours in 96 well microtiter plates with DFMO, IFN alpha, beta and combinations of both agents and percentage inhibition was calculated. In vivo studies utilized the intravesical implantation method as well as subcutaneous implantation. DFMO was administered as a 1% solution in the drinking water. IFN alpha, beta was given bi-weekly by intravesical administration. DFMO effectively inhibited MBT-2 growth in vitro. The ID50 was 0.08 mM and peak inhibitory activity was reached at concentrations of 0.16 mM and remained constant with concentrations of up to 10 mM. IFN alpha, beta also inhibited the in vitro proliferation of MBT-2 with maximum inhibition (46%) at 2,000 U/ml. Combinations of DFMO and IFN alpha, beta showed increased anti-proliferative activity. The degree of enhancement varied with synergism, additivity, or sub-additivity at varying drug concentrations. In vivo, DFMO significantly retarded the growth of tumors implanted subcutaneously (p less than .05) and significantly delayed the outgrowth of tumors implanted intravesically (p less than .01). IFN alpha, beta alone was ineffective in vivo and produced no additive effect in vivo when used in combination with DFMO. Results of our investigation show that DFMO inhibits proliferation of MBT-2 cells in vitro and exhibits a similar effect in vivo against subcutaneous and intravesical tumor implants. IFN alpha, beta alone demonstrated anti-proliferative activity in vitro but did not affect MBT-2 growth in vivo. Although the combination of DFMO and IFN alpha, beta exhibited enhanced activity in vitro, no enhancement was observed with combination therapy in vivo.\r"

Tests in 84 patients were positive for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies by an abnormal rabbit brain neutralization procedure, positive for the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies, or both. Twenty-three of these 84 patients had 51 separate surgical procedures, 18 vascular and 33 nonvascular. Four patients had 11 postoperative thrombotic complications (during same hospitalization), involving peripheral arteries in nine cases, vein in one, and coronary artery in one. Nine of the 18 vascular procedures were complicated by thrombosis, whereas only two of the 33 nonvascular procedures were complicated by thrombosis (p less than 0.025). Three of the seven patients who had a vascular procedure suffered multiple postoperative thrombotic complications, and ultimately all three required an amputation. At the time of these thrombotic complications, all three patients had not received any perioperative medications (anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and/or corticosteroids). Further analysis revealed a correlation between preoperative medications and the lack of postoperative complications, suggesting that perioperative corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and/or antiplatelet agents may protect against postoperative thrombosis. We conclude that patients with the lupus anticoagulant having surgical procedures carry a significant risk of postoperative thrombotic complications, particularly after vascular procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of these, 64 were residents of the county and 63 (98%) agreed to be tested for evidence of HIV infection. Eight (13%) were HIV antibody positive. Thirty-six initially HIV antibody-negative men were reevaluated at a six-month follow-up visit, and three had seroconverted during this time. Of 25 men who reported practicing anal receptive intercourse, 13 (52%) were HIV antibody positive vs none of 43 men who reported strictly anal insertive intercourse. Comparing reported numbers of sexual contacts for the six-month periods before and after our initial investigation, the mean numbers of named sex contacts decreased by 82% for antibody-positive men and 54% for antibody-negative men. None of the men reported using condoms before entering the study; at the six-month follow-up visit, four (80%) of five of the antibody-positive men and 25 (69%) of 36 of the antibody-negative men reported using condoms at least some of the time.\r"

  ".W": "An analysis of more than two decades of poll results has identified six major trends in public opinion likely to affect the health care system of the 1990s. Americans favor more rather than less health spending, at least as long as the economy remains strong, and they do not think the deficit problem requires cuts in medical care outlays. Should there be a serious economic downturn, however, the public would reverse itself and would favor reduced spending that relies on a different set of strategies than those favored by most health policy experts, particularly in regard to spending for care for the elderly. In either case, the poll results suggest that Americans may be less inclined to participate in newer forms of medical practice, such as health maintenance organizations or preferred provider organizations, than anticipated, and that the commercialization of health care is leading to a decline in public confidence in the leaders of medicine. This latter trend may result in a lack of trust in professionals' views concerning the quality of care and may presage more stringent government involvement in and regulation of health services.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of prospectively identified factors on the duration of hospital stay and part A charges in 240 hospitalizations (of 230 patients) for the diagnosis-related group \"medical back problems\" (DRG 243) at a tertiary-care institution in 1985 to determine whether heterogeneity existed within this reimbursement category. We confirmed our initial postulates that nonosteoporotic fractures and neck problems, as well as hospitalizations primarily for myelography after outpatient neurologic evaluation, had considerably different economic outcomes and thus excluded these categories from further analysis. Statistical analysis (forward stepwise regression) of the remaining 132 patients who had \"general medical back problems\" showed that increasing age, associated osteoporosis, and therapeutic injections best explained variation in the natural logarithm of duration of stay (R2 = 0.16). Total number of diagnoses, spondylosis, associated osteoporosis, age, therapeutic injections, and performance of special procedures best explained the variation in the logarithm of part A charges (R2 = 0.29). The ability to identify factors within a specified category that affect the duration of hospitalization and part A charges jeopardizes the fairness of prospective payment, and we believe that DRG 243 should be adjusted for age, comorbidity, and readily identifiable clinical syndromes that have disparate economic consequences. Because of poorly substantiated efficacy and a significant association with longer hospital stays and higher part A charges, clinicians should review the use of therapeutic injections for medical back problems. Analysis of case-mix such as ours should be helpful in promoting efficient practice and ensuring the fairness of any reimbursement system.\r"

At 1 week the eradication rates for ceftriaxone and rifampicin were 97% and 75%; at 2 weeks they were 97% and 81%, respectively. No serious side-effects were associated with either agent.

ISG was given intramuscularly before and 1 week after transfusion. 98 controls and 100 in the ISG group completed the study. Post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis developed in 11 (11.2%) controls but in only 3 (3.0%) of the ISG group (p = 0.0203). 8 (72.7%) of control group with hepatitis had symptoms, and in 5 (45.4%) the disease became chronic. The disease was self-limiting in all 3 ISG patients affected, and only 1 of them had symptoms. Among those with non-A, non-B hepatitis aminotransferase levels were higher in the controls than in the ISG patients. Incubation periods longer than 8 weeks correlated with a tendency for the disease to become chronic. ISG recipients had shorter as well as more homogeneous incubation periods. ISG could be a safe, low-cost means for preventing post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis which does not call for the discarding of donated blood.\r"

The progression and prognosis of these disease depends on the location and immunologic status of the patient. This case represents the fourth reported case of a nonimmunologic compromised patient with intracranial extension of aspergillosis. The patient presented with unilateral pansinusitis and radiographic evidence of orbital and anterior cranial fossa invasion. This case illustrates the difficulty of establishing the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and differentiating it from neoplastic entities.

The speed of single twitches of fast ADR limb muscles was normal up to an age of about 60 days but decreased at later ages. At any age between 10 and 120 days postnatal, fast and slow muscles of the mutant displayed after-contractions of 1-3 (5) seconds duration. These coincided with electrical after-activity of muscle, as demonstrated by electromyography. After-contractions and EMG signals were suppressed by the membrane-stabilizing drug tocainide. These physiological data suggest that ADR is a myotonia. With a few exceptions, limb and trunk muscles of ADR animals showed a uniform oxidative phenotype with a lack of large diameter glycolytic fibers. The histochemical muscle phenotype of the ADR mouse was partially reversed by a long-term treatment with tocainide.\r"

In order to analyze the etiology of this hereditary defect, mutant and wildtype muscle fibers were studied by intracellular recording. Direct stimulation of ADR muscle fibers elicited runs of action potentials of 1-5 seconds duration, with declining amplitudes and varying frequencies. The electrical after-activity coincided with after-contractions of the fiber, and both phenomena could be suppressed by the membrane-stabilizing drug tocainide. Since similar runs of APs were observed with wildtype muscle in chloride-free medium, the possible involvement of chloride conductance in the ADR syndrome was studied. Although membrane time constants in wildtype muscle were 4 times prolonged in chloride-free medium, those of ADR muscle were only 1.4 times longer. This finding indicated a drastic reduction of chloride conductance of the ADR muscle membrane. We conclude that ADR is a myotonia, related in its etiology to hereditary myotonias of man.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the hospital stays are longer and charges within a given diagnosis-related group (DRG) are higher for poor patients, we examined patterns of care for patients hospitalized at the Brigham and Women's Hospital for connective-tissue disorders (DRGs 240 and 241) from 1981 to 1985. The socioeconomic characteristics of 402 patients were determined through interviews, and the severity of their illness was measured by means of a standard scale of function--the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale. After excluding outliers and adjusting for DRG, we found that hospital stays were significantly longer for subgroups of patients of lower socioeconomic status, whether this was defined by occupation, education, or income (P less than 0.05 for all three). Patients of low socioeconomic status also had higher total hospital charges, although the differences were not statistically significant. The differences between patients of low socioeconomic status and those of high socioeconomic status were as great as 25 percent for length of stay and 16 percent for charges. These trends persisted after we adjusted for patients' age and sex, the severity of illness, the year of discharge, the doctor's specialty, whether the patient had a regular doctor, and whether the patient lived alone. Our results suggest that for at least some conditions, hospital care for poor patients entails longer stays and probably requires the use of more resources.\r"

  ".W": "Knowledge of the phylogenetic history of the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) is important for our understanding of the epidemiology of AIDS, the disease caused by these viruses. Reconstruction of the evolutionary tree is hampered, however, by two problems. One is the high variation in nucleotide sequence between the known HIV isolates which can create formidable difficulties in identifying homologous genomic sites that may be used in a molecular phylogenetic reconstruction. Another impediment has been the lack of unequivocal time calibration points: there is only a sparse 'fossil record' for HIV and limited historical epidemiological data. We have largely overcome these difficulties by: (1) a thorough optimal-sequence alignment analysis; (2) the inclusion of sequences of an early (1976) HIV-1 isolate, a recent (1986) HIV-2 isolate and two simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) along with five other HIV-1 isolates; and (3) the reconstruction of a minimum-length evolutionary tree based on the envelope-gene variable positions. We conclude that HIV-1 may have evolved from its common ancestor with HIV-2 as recently as 40 years ago.\r"

  ".W": "Domains of differential homeotic gene activity are formed at specific positions along the anteroposterior axis of the early Drosophila embryo. Homeotic genes are required continuously throughout development, so that homeotic gene activity has to be maintained independently of the positional information provided in the early embryo. In the ectoderm, the domains of homeotic gene activity partially overlap, but we have found that in the visceral mesoderm at least three of these genes are expressed in adjacent and mutually exclusive domains. It has been proposed that stable, sharply demarcated domains of this type could be established if a homeotic gene product stimulated its own expression locally and inhibited the expression of other homeotic genes, which Meinhardt has termed autocatalysis and mutual exclusion respectively. Furthermore, autocatalysis of this kind can in principle account for the maintenance of homeotic gene activity throughout development. We find that the unique domain of Ultrabithorax (Ubx) expression in the visceral mesoderm is dependent both on autocatalysis and on an exclusion mechanism: Ubx product is required for its own synthesis, whereas the product of the posteriorly adjacent gene abdominal-A represses Ubx expression.\r"

We now demonstrate that NO can be synthesized from L-arginine by porcine aortic endothelial cells in culture. Nitric oxide was detected by bioassay, chemiluminescence or by mass spectrometry. Release of NO from the endothelial cells induced by bradykinin and the calcium ionophore A23187 was reversibly enhanced by infusions of L-arginine and L-citrulline, but not D-arginine or other close structural analogues. Mass spectrometry studies using 15N-labelled L-arginine indicated that this enhancement was due to the formation of NO from the terminal guanidino nitrogen atom(s) of L-arginine. The strict substrate specificity of this reaction suggests that L-arginine is the precursor for NO synthesis in vascular endothelial cells.\r"

IVIG may be valuable in restoring humoral immune deficiency, treating a number of viral and bacterial infections, and modulating immune responses. It will be important to analyze carefully the effectiveness of IVIG therapy using well-designed, controlled trials and to have specific IVIG preparations with defined activity and high levels of pathogen-specific antibody.\r"

Fever results when the thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus is shifted upward. Fever is a part of the acute phase response, a generalized reaction to infection or inflammation initiated by interleukin-1 (IL-1). Prostaglandin E2 is the neural mediator of fever induced by IL-1, so fever can be suppressed by drugs that interfere with prostaglandin synthesis. Fever can be reduced by peripheral cooling, but the preferred method is treatment with antipyretic drugs. Although the host's response to infection is enhanced by small increases in body temperature, antipyretic treatment does not appear to interfere with recovery in humans.\r"

A method using three-dimensional computer graphics was applied for superposing molecules and receptor mapping. The main feature of the method is that molecules are superposed in terms of spatial arrangement of physical and chemical properties but not in terms of the atomic positions as in conventional methods. This led to successful extraction of common structural features required for potent tumor-promoting activity: two hydrogen donors, a hydrogen acceptor, and a large lipophilic group. Their mutual spatial arrangements are most important for biological activity.\r"

A hemi- and homozygous lethal P-element insertion into the coding sequence of this domain causes premature translation termination and therefore truncation of the protein, leaving only 20 heptamer repeats. While loss of approximately 50% of the repeat structure in this mutant is a lethal event in vivo, enzyme containing the truncated subunit remains capable of accurate initiation at promoters in vitro. Moreover, treatment of purified intact RNA polymerase II with protease, to remove the entire repeat domain, does not eliminate the enzyme's ability to initiate accurately in vitro. Possible in vivo functions for this unusual protein domain are considered in light of these results.\r"

These properties included (i) inhibition by phenylalkylamine antagonists, such as verapamil, (ii) inhibition by the GTP-binding protein Go in the presence of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate, and (iii) regulation of phenylalkylamine inhibition as a result of phosphorylation by a polypeptide-dependent protein kinase (PK-P). By selective reconstitution of protein fractions obtained by wheat germ lectin and ion-exchange chromatography, a separation of Ca2+-channel activity (fraction C) from regulatory component(s) (fraction R) responsible for verapamil sensitivity was achieved. Reconstitution of fraction C alone yielded vesicles that exhibited channel-mediated 45Ca2+ uptake that could be directly inhibited by coreconstitution of Go in the presence of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. However, the 45Ca2+ uptake obtained with fraction C was not inhibited by verapamil. Coreconstitution of fractions C and R yielded vesicles in which the sensitivity of 45Ca2+ uptake to verapamil was restored. The verapamil sensitivity of this preparation could be inhibited by PK-P. Fraction C, obtained by wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography followed by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, included a 180-kDa protein that was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A) but not by PK-P and a 145-kDa protein (180 kDa under nonreducing conditions) that was not phosphorylated by either kinase. Fraction R contained proteins that did not adsorb to wheat germ lectin and included 165-kDa and 55-kDa proteins that were phosphorylated by PK-P but not by PK-A. These results suggest a complex model for Ca2+-channel regulation in skeletal muscle involving a number of distinct, separable protein components.\r"

Adducted genomic DNA is digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme, treated with Escherichia coli UvrABC excision nuclease (ABC excinuclease), subjected to alkaline gel electrophoresis, and probed for specific sequences by Southern hybridization. The ABC excinuclease incises DNA containing bulky adducts and thus reduces the intensity of the full-length fragments in Southern hybridization in proportion to the number of adducts present in the probed sequence. This method is similar to that developed by Bohr et al. [Bohr, V. A., Smith, C. A., Okumoto, D. S. & Hanawalt, P. C. (1985) Cell 40, 359-369] for quantifying pyrimidine dimers by using T4 endonuclease V. Because of the wide substrate range of ABC exinuclease, however, our method can be used to quantify a large variety of DNA adducts in specific genomic sequences.\r"

Here we describe cDNA clones encoding for one of the lysosome-associated membrane proteins with apparent Mr approximately equal to 120,000, lamp A. The amino acid sequence based on the fully coded cDNA shows that as many as 18 potential N-glycosylation sites can be found in the total of 385 amino acid residues. The results obtained by endoglycosidase F digestion support the conclusion that this glycoprotein contains 18 N-glycans. These N-glycosylation sites are clustered in two domains; one contains 10 and the other contains 8 N-glycosylation sites. These domains are separated by a (proline-serine)-rich region that has a distinct homology to the IgA hinge structure. The first N-glycosylated domain is elongated to a potential leader peptide toward the NH2-terminal end. The second N-glycosylated domain, on the other hand, is connected to a putative transmembrane portion consisting of hydrophobic amino acids. This segment, in turn, is elongated to a short cytoplasmic segment composed of 11 amino acid residues at the COOH-terminal end.\r"

  ".W": "Xenopus laevis oocytes are giant cells suitable for studies of plasma membrane receptors and signal transduction pathways because of their capacity to express receptors after injection of heterologous mRNA. We studied depolarizing chloride currents evoked by acetylcholine (AcCho) in native oocytes (\"intrinsic AcCho response\"), by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in oocytes injected with pituitary (GH3) cell RNA (\"acquired TRH response\"), and by AcCho in oocytes injected with rat brain RNA (\"acquired AcCho response\"). We found differences in the latencies and patterns of these responses and in the responsiveness to these agonists when applied to the animal or vegetal hemisphere, even though all of the responses are mediated by the same signal transduction pathway. The common intrinsic response to AcCho is characterized by minimal latency (0.86 +/- 0.05 sec), a rapid, transient depolarization followed by a distinct prolonged depolarization, and larger responses obtained after AcCho application at the vegetal rather than the animal hemisphere. By contrast, the acquired responses to TRH and AcCho are characterized by much longer latencies, 9.3 +/- 1.0 and 5.5 +/- 0.8 sec, respectively, and large rapid depolarizations followed by less distinct prolonged depolarizations. The responsiveness on the two hemispheres to TRH and AcCho in mRNA-injected oocytes is opposite to that for the common intrinsic AcCho response in that there is a much greater response when agonist is applied at the animal rather than the vegetal hemisphere. We suggest that the differences in these responses are caused by differences in the intrinsic properties of these receptors. Because different receptors appear to be segregated in the same oocyte in distinct localizations, Xenopus oocytes may be an important model system in which to study receptor sorting in polarized cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the rate of synthesis and degradation of tyrosinase (monophenol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.18.1), the critical enzyme involved in mammalian pigmentation, using pulse-chase metabolic labeling of murine melanoma cells and immunoprecipitation of protein extracts with antibodies directed specifically against the enzyme. We have found that tyrosinase is synthesized and glycosylated within melanocytes rapidly, since significant quantities of pulse-labeled enzyme could be detected within 30 min. The maximum amount of enzyme was processed within 4 hr, and the t1/2 of tyrosinase in vivo was 10 hr (compared to 120 hr with purified enzyme), suggesting that tyrosinase activity in melanocytes is at least in part regulated by rapid synthesis and active degradation. We also have examined the melanogenic stimulation caused by melanocyte-stimulating hormone, using metabolic labeling, radiometric assays, and immunofluorescence techniques; responding cells increased their melanogenic potential more than 7-fold within 4 days without increasing their levels of tyrosinase synthesis. The results demonstrate that a pool of inactive tyrosinase exists in melanocytes and that rapid increases in enzyme activity elicited by melanocyte-stimulating hormone reflect an alteration in the activity of a preexisting pool of intracellular tyrosinase.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of diploid human fibroblasts with an alkylating mutagen has been shown to induce stable, anchorage-independent cell populations at frequencies (11 X 10(-4) consistent with an activating mutation. After treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts with the mutagen benzo[a]pyrene (+/-)anti- 7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide and selection in soft agar, 17 anchorage-independent clones were isolated and expanded, and their cellular DNA was used to cotransfect NIH 3T3 cells along with pSV2neo. DNA from 11 of the 17 clones induced multiple NIH 3T3 cell tumors in recipient nude mice. Southern blot analyses showed the presence of human Alu repetitive sequences in all of the NIH 3T3 tumor cell DNAs. Intact, human HRAS sequences were observed in 2 of the 11 tumor groups, whereas no hybridization was detected when human KRAS or NRAS probes were used. Slow-migrating ras p21 proteins, consistent with codon 12 mutations, were observed i in the same two NIH 3T3 tumor cell groups that contained the human HRAS bands. Genomic DNA from one of these two human anchorage-independent cell populations (clone 21A) was used to enzymatically amplify a portion of exon 1 of the HRAS gene. Direct sequence analysis of the amplified DNA indicated equal presence of a wild-type (GGC) and mutant (GTC) allele of the HRAS gene. The results demonstrate that exposure of normal human cells to a common environmental mutagen yields HRAS GC----TA codon 12 transversions that have been commonly observed in human tumors. This oncogene as well as yet to be identified oncogene are also shown to stably confer anchorage-independence to human cells.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen free radicals are highly reactive species generated by many cellular oxidation-reduction processes. These radicals damage cellular constituents and have been causally implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. We report here that oxygen free radicals generated by Fe2+ in aqueous solution are mutagenic. Aerobic incubation of luminal diameter X174 am3 (amber 3 mutation) DNA with Fe2+ results in decreased phage survival when the treated DNA is transfected into Escherichia coli spheroplasts. Transfection of the treated DNA into SOS-induced spheroplasts results in an increase in mutagenesis as great as 50-fold. Both killing and mutagenesis can be prevented by binding of Fe2+ with deferoxamine or by the addition of catalase or mannitol. These results suggest that DNA damage and mutagenesis brought about by Fe2+ are likely to occur by a Fenton-type mechanism that involves the generation of (i) hydrogen peroxide by the autoxidation of iron and (ii) hydroxyl radicals by the interaction of the hydrogen peroxide with Fe2+. DNA sequence analysis of the Fe2+-induced mutants indicates that reversion of the phage phenotype to wild type occurs largely by a transversion type of mutation involving substitution of deoxyadenosine for thymidine opposite a template deoxyadenosine. Mutagenesis is not abolished by incubation of Fe2+-treated luminal diameter X174 am3 DNA with an apurinic endonuclease and only partially abolished by incubation with alkali, suggesting that a large fraction of the mutagenesis by oxygen free radicals is not caused by formation of apurinic sites but instead involves an as-yet-to-be-defined alteration in deoxyadenosine. These findings raise the possibility that free iron localized in cellular DNA may cause mutations by the generation of oxygen free radicals.\r"
