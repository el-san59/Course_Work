  ".W": "To determine the effectiveness of nonoperative and operative treatment of initial acute patellar dislocation, we reviewed the charts of 399 patients with the diagnosis of an acute dislocation, seen during a 30 year period. One hundred patients (103 knees) met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The average age of the patient at injury was 21.7 years (range, 9 to 72 years). Length of followup averaged 8 years (range, 2 to 26 years). Retrospectively, we divided the patients into two groups, according to the examination of their unaffected knee. Group I (69 knees) showed evidence on examination of congenital abnormality of the extensor mechanism in the unaffected knee, indicating a predisposition to dislocate with less significant trauma. Group II (34 knees) showed no clinically perceptible congenital predisposition to dislocate based on examination of the unaffected knee. In the nonoperatively treated knees in Group I, there was a 52% (28/54) incidence of good or excellent results. The nonoperatively treated knees in Group II had a 75% (15/20) incidence of good or excellent results. Acute dislocation occurred more frequently in males than in females. Recurrence was rarer in patients whose initial dislocation had occurred when they were over 15 years old. Contrary to recently published reports, primary acute traumatic patellar dislocations can be treated with nonoperative therapy with good or excellent results. Initial evaluation should include examination of the uninvolved knee which, if found to have signs of congenital abnormality, would indicate a worse prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "This study presents eight patients with stress fracture of the anterolateral cortex of the midshaft of the tibia. All of the patients, ranging in age from 14 to 23 years, were competitive basketball players who experienced pain while running or jumping for an average of 4.4 months before the diagnosis was made. Eight patients were treated with rest and/or pulsing electromagnetic field therapy. Although one of the patients required bone grafting procedure, all eight of these patients showed complete healing and were able to return to full activity after an average of 8.7 months of treatment. They have remained asymptomatic for an average of 14.7 months. The overall time from initial symptoms to return to competition averaged 12.5 months in this group of athletes. The results presented in this paper suggest that rest and pulsing electromagnetic field therapy may result in healing in some patients with delayed union stress fractures of the anterolateral cortex of the midshaft of the tibia. Although this injury is associated with a prolonged healing period, seven of eight patients with adequate followup in our study were able to return to competition without complications following treatment. One patient was asymptomatic for 33 months before experiencing a reinjury. In conclusion, we feel that diagnosis of stress fracture should be primary consideration in basketball players presenting with a prolonged history of pain on the anterolateral aspect of the midthird of the tibia. Once the diagnosis is made we recommend initial treatment consist of rest and external electrical stimulation for a minimum time of 3 to 6 months prior to considering surgical intervention.\r"

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 119 hand injuries in 108 patients treated at the University of Chicago hand clinic. All of the injuries were caused by the impact of a 16 inch circumference softball. Of the 119 injuries, 87 (73%) had bone involvement. Operative treatment was required in 26 (22%) injuries, 23 involving fractures and 3 involving soft tissue only. There was one (3.8%) operative complication. Of all injuries, 101 (86%) involved the finger joints, including 46 (39%) injuries to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, 48 (40%) to the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, and 7 (6%) to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. The most common DIP joint injury was a mallet injury. This fracture, the most common single type of injury in our series, accounted for 27% of all injuries. Of all mallet injuries, 86% were fractures. The most common PIP joint injury was a volar plate fracture, the second most common injury in our series. Variables such as the patient's sex, dominance or nondominance of hands, and early or late season play were not associated with a higher risk of injury. Certain parts of the hand, such as the more ulnar digits and the DIP and PIP joints, were at particularly high risk of injury.\r"

In 1986, 1,500 licensed racers were compared to a similar group of over 3,900 racers in the 3 previous years to determine if the incidence and severity of injury could be lessened. Factors addressed were the use of helmets, binding-type pedals, equipment inspection, improved medical coverage, and the prevention of acute mountain sickness and exposure. The injury rate and injuries per 100 hours of racing competition were half of that seen in prior years. Severity of injury was lessened as over 80% of the injured racers returned to competition within 1 week in contrast to only 66% during the period from 1983 to 1985. A successful program for injury prevention and the lessening of the severity of injury at altitudes is proposed.\r"

Group I consisted of six anaerobically trained athletes, Group II consisted of five aerobically trained athletes, and Group III consisted of six sedentary individuals. Experimental trials involved maximal leg extensions performed on a Cybex II dynamometer under conditions of euhydration and hypohydration of minus 3% body weight. Integrated electromyographic data were also collected during each trial to factor out motivation as a variable. The maximum number of leg extension repetitions performed at or above 50% of each subject's peak torque output were compared between treatments and among the three groups. A 2 x 3 factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant decrease in muscle endurance when comparing euhydration to hypohydration among the anaerobically trained subjects as well as among the sedentary subjects (P less than 0.05). The aerobically trained subjects showed no significant decline in muscle endurance when comparing performance under both experimental conditions. It was hypothesized that the training adaptations that occur with aerobic conditioning and are primarily associated with increased plasma volume may be the key to explaining these results.\r"

Using the Cybex II (Cybex, Division of Lumex, Inc., Ronkonkoma, NY), test data were gathered on the dominant and nondominant shoulders in the supine 90 degrees abducted test position (90 degrees AbTP) and the standing neutral test position (neutral TP). Tests were performed at 90 and 240 deg/sec. The HUMAC (Computer Sports Medicine, Inc., Flemington, NJ) computer system was used to analyze data. Means and standard deviations for peak torque, total work, peak torque to body weight ratios, and agonist/antagonist ratios are presented. Comparison of dominant to non-dominant sides and 90 degrees AbTP to neutral TP values are reported. Peak torque and total work values for the throwing side internal rotators were significantly higher than the nonthrowing side in all tests. Pitching side external rotators failed to show this dominance. External/internal rotation ratios for peak torque and total work were significantly lower on the pitching side, suggesting a relative imbalance of cuff musculature compared to the nonpitching shoulder. Significant differences existed between data gathered in the two different test positions. In the 90 degrees AbTP, external rotation peak torque and total work values and external/internal rotation peak torque and total work ratios were higher than the equivalent values gathered in the neutral TP. Internal rotation peak torque and total work values tended to be higher in the neutral TP than in the 90 degrees AbTP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 4,358 male joggers, 45.8% had sustained jogging injuries during the 1 year study period, 14.2% had required medical care, and 2.3% had missed work because of jogging injuries. Occurrence of jogging injuries was independently associated with higher weekly mileage (P less than 0.001), history of previous running injuries (P less than 0.001), and competitive training motivation (P = 0.03). Higher mileage was also associated with more frequent medical consultations due entirely to jogging-related injuries. In 33 to 44 year olds (N = 1,757), the number of years of running was inversely related to incidence of injuries (P = 0.02). Injuries were not significantly related to race running speed, training surface, characteristics of running shoes, or relative weight. Achillodynia and calf muscle symptoms were the two most common overuse injuries and occurred significantly more often among older runners with increased weekly mileage. We conclude that jogging injuries are frequent, that the number of firmly established etiologic factors is low, and that, in recommending jogging, moderation should be the watchword.\r"

A total of 18 patients (mean age, 34 years), divided into two groups, participated in this study. Venous plasma levels were measured at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 240 minute intervals following a single instillation into the knee joint. All patients had suspected traumatic internal derangement of the knee. Electrocardiogram tracings, blood pressure, and neurologic assessment were monitored at each venous sampling interval or more often if clinically indicated. The type and amount of supplemental anesthesia were also recorded. None of our 18 patients required a general anesthetic because of pain although the following procedures were performed: meniscectomy, plica release, abrasion chondroplasty, loose body retrieval, and limited meniscal repair. A new methodology for the measurement of plasma bupivacaine using the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer is described. Monitoring specific molecular mass fragments allows the measurement of picogram per milliliter levels of bupivacaine. The highest peak plasma concentration occurred 20 minutes after instillation of 30 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine. The 625 +/- 225 ng/ml level was well below the 2,500 to 4,000 ng/ml reported to elicit early subjective CNS symptoms of bupivacaine toxicity. Thus, a single dose intraarticular instillation of 30 ml 0.5% or 0.25% bupivacaine is convenient, efficacious, and pharmacologically safe for routine clinical arthroscopy.\r"

  ".W": "The anesthetic-sparing and hemodynamic effects of the stereoisomers of the highly selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist medetomidine were studied in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Male beagles were anesthetized with halothane in oxygen. After a 2-hour equilibration period, halothane MAC and baseline hemodynamic functions were determined. DL-(n = 7), D- (n = 5), or L-medetomidine (n = 5) at 1, 3, and 10 micrograms/kg was administered via a right atrial port over 15 minutes while each dog was given halothane at the MAC dose for that animal. Twenty minutes after the end of infusion (when the hemodynamic variables were stable), hemodynamic function was reassessed. Halothane MAC was then redetermined. MAC for halothane significantly decreased after DL-medetomidine administration in a dose-dependent fashion to the extent that at the highest dose (10 micrograms/kg) the halothane MAC was less than 0.1%. This effect could be mimicked by the D-isomer, whereas the L-isomer was without effect. Neither isomer changed the mean arterial pressure, whereas only the D-isomer significantly decreased heart rate and cardiac output. Medetomidine, the highly selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, reduces the MAC for volatile anesthesia by a greater degree than with any other physiologic, pharmacologic, or pathologic intervention thus far reported. The fact that this effect is stereospecific suggests a structure activity relation that can be accounted for by a homogeneous receptor population. The role of medetomidine as a supplemental anesthetic agent appears promising and requires further investigation.\r"

Antinociception was determined by observing the response to a clamp applied to the tail (Haffner test) of the mouse and by the rat tail-flick test; log dose-response curves for antinociception were generated for each drug in each test. Motor coordination and other behavioral effects were also observed. Morphine and fentanyl (mu-opiate agonists) as well as ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) and U50488H (kappa-opiate agonists), together with buprenorphine (partial mu-opiate agonist) and the alpha-2-adrenergic agonist clonidine, all produced antinociception in both species without causing significant behavioral or motor dysfunctions at antinociceptive doses. Xylazine (also an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist), ketamine, procaine, and lidocaine inhibited responses but only at doses that also produced motor impairment or paralysis. Nalbuphine (mixed opiate agonist-antagonist) was without any effect in both species. These data suggest that the mu- and kappa-opiate agonists and clonidine are the preferred agents for producing antinociception without compromising motor function.\r"

Train-of-four stimulation was applied to the ulnar and phrenic nerves. The force of contraction and the electromyographic response of the adductor pollicis were measured and compared with the diaphragmatic electromyogram. Then dose-response curves for both muscles were constructed using incremental doses of succinylcholine with an infusion to replace metabolized or redistributing drug. Linear regressions were obtained between the logit transformation of neuromuscular blockade at the adductor pollicis and diaphragm and the logarithm of the dose. The diaphragm was relatively resistant to succinylcholine. At 90% adductor pollicis block, the diaphragm was only (mean +/- SEM) 37 +/- 3% blocked. The diaphragm required 1.8 +/- 0.2 times as much succinylcholine as the adductor pollicis for an identical 90% block. The ED50 and ED90 values for succinylcholine at the diaphragm were 0.23 +/- 0.04 and 0.40 +/- 0.09 mg/kg, respectively. Corresponding values for the adductor pollicis were 0.14 +/- 0.01 and 0.21 +/- 0.02 mg/kg. The data indicate that the degree of adductor pollicis blockade might overestimate the intensity of diaphragmatic paralysis.\r"

The machines ranged in age from 1 to 28 years (8 +/- 6, mean +/- SD), with 47.3% manufactured since 1980, 39.1% between 1970 and 1980; and 13.6% before 1970. Regular maintenance was provided for 112 machines (66.2%) by the manufacturer, whereas 55 machines (32.5%) were maintained by independent contractors. Two machines designated as backup machines received no maintenance. There was no source of oxygen to back up oxygen piped from a central source on five machines. Thirteen machines had leaks over 500 ml/min distal to the common gas outlet, the most common sites being the carbon dioxide absorber, dome valves, and oxygen monitor sensor adaptors. Another two machines had leaks over 500 ml/min proximal to the common gas outlet. Forty-two of the 169 machines did not have an oxygen analyzer; another 18 had oxygen analyzers that did not function properly. Only 29 (23.5%) of 123 machines equipped with a ventilator had a working high-pressure alarm, whereas functioning low-pressure alarms were available on 104 machines (84.5%). Fourteen of the 383 vaporizers tested for calibration did not meet the calibration standard recommended by the manufacturers. None of the 32 liquid anesthetic samples collected and analyzed during the survey showed contaminants. Only four (8.8%) hospitals utilized a written anesthesia machine checklist. There was no correlation between the number of malfunctions observed and ages of the machines, although the older machines tended to lack the basic monitoring devices and safety features.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The calculated ED95 doses of atropine in groups A and B at 5 minutes were 0.024 and 0.055 mg/kg, and at 10 minutes, the ED95 doses were also similar, being 0.027 and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Static compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) was measured by the interrupter technique in 18 anesthetized children to compare the effects of ketamine on Crs with those of halothane. Crs was the slope of the pressure-volume (P-V) curve obtained by repeated brief airway occlusions throughout relaxed expiration, and the intercept of the P-V curve on the pressure axis was the intrinsic positive end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEPi). Expiratory time (Te) was measured during a period of quiet breathing, and the passive expiratory time constant (tau) was measured during the relaxed expiration after an end-inspiratory occlusion. Nine children were anesthetized with a continuous infusion of ketamine and a matching group of nine children inhaled halothane in oxygen. Crs was significantly greater in the ketamine group (22.8 +/- 6.2 ml/cm H2O) than in the halothane group (15.7 +/- 5.5 ml/cm H2O). The tau value was also significantly greater in the ketamine group. Mean PEEPi in the ketamine group was 2.3 +/- 1.8 cm H2O and in the halothane group was 0.4 +/- 0.8 cm H2O. PEEPi correlated inversely with Te/tau according to a logarithmic function. It was concluded that, in children anesthetized with ketamine, Crs is significantly greater than that in children anesthetized with halothane, and the resultant prolongation of tau and decreased Te/tau with ketamine anesthesia lead to increased PEEPi.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of opiates to be a complete anesthetic has been assessed in animals. These studies have investigated the serum levels of opiate required to produce a decrease in anesthetic requirement for a concomitantly administered inhalation anesthetic. A linear dose-response relation has been observed between opiate serum level and reduction in anesthetic requirement up to the level of 50% reduction in minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC). These studies have not demonstrated the production of one MAC anesthesia by the opiates. Recent EEG studies have provided another means of comparing the central nervous system effects of opiates and inhalation anesthetics. The serum levels of several opiates associated with a 50% reduction (IC50 or 50% inhibitory concentration) in maximal spectral edge frequency (SEF) have been reported. The free, unionized serum levels of each opiate at IC50 in humans or 50% MAC reduction in animals are remarkably similar. We calculated brain lipid opiate content at these serum levels using available physiochemical data. The calculated nanogram and molar brain lipid contents of the drugs fell within a 10-fold range while serum levels varied by 5000-fold. This similarity in membrane lipid content in association with EEG and anesthetic effects suggests that opiate \"anesthesia\" may involve a membrane effect in addition to the well established receptor interaction.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hypothermic hemodilutional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on plasma sufentanil and catecholamine concentrations was studied in four groups of ten patients each, receiving four different doses of sufentanil. Samples for measurement of sufentanil were obtained before CPB, at 15, 30, and 45 minutes of CPB, during rewarming, immediately after and 15, 60, and 240 minutes after CPB. In addition, in groups III and IV, which received the highest dose of sufentanil, blood samples were also obtained for measurement of plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Sufentanil concentration decreased in all groups with the start of CPB (group I, 2.92 +/- 0.2 to 2.04 +/- 0.2; group II, 3.30 +/- 0.3 to 1.51 +/- 0.2; group III, 7.08 +/- 0.7 to 3.45 +/- 0.3; group IV, 10.33 +/- 0.5 to 4.59 +/- 0.5 ng/ml). No further decreases occurred during CPB but increases occurred with rewarming. The first measurement after CPB approached the concentration before CPB (group I, 2.82 +/- 0.3; group II, 2.56 +/- 0.5; group III, 4.42 +/- 0.4; group IV, 6.10 +/- 0.4 ng/ml). Norepinephrine concentrations demonstrated a wide variability with no significant changes. Epinephrine levels increased significantly during rewarming in both groups (group III, 141 +/- 23 to 279 +/- 79 pg/ml; P less than 0.05; group IV, 105 +/- 24 to 267 +/- 68 pg/ml, P less than 0.05). The stability of plasma sufentanil concentrations during CPB suggest that no measurable metabolism or excretion occurred. The increase with rewarming and after CPB suggest significant sequestration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were no differences in lung pathology in infected animals given one of the three anesthetic agents, or no anesthesia, though histopathologic changes in the nasal turbinates were significantly greater in ferrets given enflurane.

Cerebral ischemia was produced by unilateral carotid ligation and hemorrhagic hypotension to 30 mm Hg (moderate ischemia) or 25 mm Hg (severe ischemia) in young (6 month) and old (26-28 month) rats anesthetized with 1 MAC halothane. Young rats had significantly better neurologic outcomes than old rats after similar ischemic challenges. This advantage disappears, however, when the inspired oxygen tension is altered to produce similar PaO2 in both age groups during ischemia. Measures of regional CBF with radioactive microspheres showed a 70% decrease in cortical blood flow in the ischemic cerebral hemisphere in both young and old rats. Plasma glucose concentrations increased from 150 to 250 mg/100 mL during ischemia in both age groups. Histologically, the brains showed similar signs of focal ischemic damage in striatum, hippocampus, and cortex in young and old rats. These results indicate that when blood pressure and respiratory factors are controlled experimentally during ischemia, young and aged rats have similar neurologic outcomes after cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, blind study examined the effect of nail polish color on measurement of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. Fourteen adult volunteers had blue, green, purple, black, and red nail polish applied to their finger nails. A strip-chart recording of oxygen saturation (Nellcor N100) was made in room air and later interpreted in a blinded fashion. The absorption spectra of the five polishes were determined by spectrophotometry. The spectra of nine other nail polishes and three intravenous dyes also were examined. Black, blue, and green nail polish significantly lowered oximeter readings of oxygen saturation. Blue and green produced greater decreases than purple and red; black produced an intermediate decrease. Some but not all nail polishes absorbed light at the wavelengths used by the pulse oximeter (660 nm and 940 nm). The degree of artifactual desaturation correlated best with the difference between absorbance at 660 nm and absorbance at 940 nm (r = 0.95). Spectrophotometric absorbance data suggest that other colors may interfere with pulse oximetry. On the basis of spectrophotometric data, brown-red nail polish was predicted to interfere with oximetry; subsequent pulse oximetry measurements confirmed the prediction. Nail polish should be removed routinely before pulse oximetry monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of thoracic epidural analgesia on gastric emptying were evaluated in healthy fasting volunteers. In ten volunteers, 4 mg of epidural morphine were injected at the T4 level, and ten volunteers received thoracic epidural analgesia with 0.5% bupivacaine, the latter causing block of the sympathetic innervation to the stomach. Acetaminophen absorption was used as an indirect measure of the rate of gastric emptying. After establishment of the analgesia with bupivacaine, or 160 (110-185) minutes after the administration of epidural morphine, 1.5 g acetaminophen dissolved in water was ingested. Serum samples were taken at 15-minute intervals for 2 hours and serum acetaminophen concentrations were determined by an immunologic method. Control acetaminophen absorption studies without thoracic epidural analgesia were performed in all 20 subjects on another occasion. During epidural analgesia with morphine mean serum acetaminophen concentrations were lower (P less than 0.05), the maximum serum acetaminophen concentration was lower (P less than 0.01), the time taken to reach the maximum concentration was longer (P less than 0.02), and the area under the concentration time curve from 0 to 60 minutes was smaller (P less than 0.01) than in the control study. The corresponding values during epidural analgesia with bupivacaine did not differ from the control values. Four subjects with extremely delayed gastric emptying during epidural analgesia with morphine showed no delay in gastric emptying after receiving 4 mg morphine intramuscularly. Serum morphine concentrations were lower after epidural than after intramuscular morphine. In summary, 4 mg epidural morphine delayed gastric emptying. This was not a systemic effect of morphine. Thoracic epidural analgesia with bupivacaine had no influence on gastric emptying.\r"

The nasal responses induced were evaluated by counting the number of sneezes, the quantity of nasal secretion, and of nasal airway resistance. When the effects of topical provoking agents were compared at the threshold concentration, LTD4 produced no sneezing--unlike antigen and histamine--increased nasal secretion to a lesser degree than antigen and histamine (P less than .001), and increased nasal airway resistance similar to histamine but less than antigen (P less than .1) and longer than histamine, and similar to antigen in duration. LTD4 was approximately 5,000 times stronger than histamine in threshold concentration for nasal response. In conclusion, LTD4 plays an important role in nasal allergy presumably through long lasting and strong nasal blockage effects.\r"

Lack of objective demonstration of bronchodilator efficacy, concern for possible side effects and uncertainty of the precise dosage for adequate bronchodilation are some of the factors that account for the lack of specific dosage recommendations for bronchodilators such as oral metaproterenol sulfate in children under 6 years of age. Until recently, it was not possible to objectively measure the response to bronchodilators in children below 6 years of age because of their inability to reliably perform forced expiratory maneuvers required for spirometry and their unwillingness to have airway resistance (or conductance) measurements by body plethysmography. Direct measurements of airflow resistance have been made in children with a pneumotachograph at the mouth and a balloon in the esophagus to record transpleural pressure changes; however, these techniques are invasive and require sedation. Total respiratory resistance and reactance of the respiratory system, as measured by forced oscillation technique, are pulmonary function tests that can be performed in young children who are unable to cooperate with conventional spirometric maneuvers.\r"

  ".W": "We correlated clinical symptom complexes of drugs (toxidromes) to results of 204 consecutive toxicological screens ordered in our emergency department. The toxidromes were divided into eight categories: sedative hypnotic, narcotic, stimulant, coma-apnea-seizure, hallucinogenic, anticholinergic, unknown, and \"no drugs.\" Emergency medicine nurses, clinical pharmacists, and medical residents were asked to choose one or more of the above toxidromes independently when ordering the toxicology screen. The nurses achieved the highest symptom complex recognition of the drug (55 of 61, 88%) followed by medical residents (76 of 90, 84%) and clinical pharmacists (27 of 34, 79.4%), but the differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that the major determinant in selecting correct toxidromes is clinical experience of the practitioners. Given the percentages of toxidrome recognition, it should be possible to increase efficiency of laboratory use by ordering tests only for the drugs clinically suspected in a particular toxic patient.\r"

The cumulative 24-hour urinary salicylate excretion was measured in each trial. Catharsis was achieved rapidly with whole-bowel irrigation. Oral activated charcoal without catharsis was most effective in decreasing aspirin absorption (P = .011).

The failure rate for conservative, non-operative management (four of 33) in \"positive\" scans was low, and represented progression of known injuries, not the appearance of unexpected injuries. Similarly, the (unplanned) surgery rate in the \"negative\" scan cases was low (one of 57).

In contrast, there has been very little information published regarding the degree of risk to emergency care providers, several of whom have been confirmed as having acquired HIV infection through occupational exposures.

Lung specimens obtained in two siblings showed extensive pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, with normal capillaries proliferating into veins and alveoli. Including our patients, four of the nine patients with pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis have presented with the clinical picture of primary pulmonary hypertension. Thus, pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis should be considered as a histologic pattern of primary pulmonary hypertension. Most other cases of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis have been similar to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Recently, disorders involving the proliferation of cytologically normal capillaries have been termed angiogenic diseases. Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis may be an angiogenic disease.\r"

There was a positive correlation between pH and ionized calcium levels (r = 0.71). Of the six patients who were successfully resuscitated, four were discharged and two died; the other six could not be resuscitated and died. By comparison, ionized and total calcium levels obtained within 3 minutes of cardiac arrest were normal in 9 patients who had cardiac arrests in the intensive care unit or during surgery. All were discharged. These data are the first to document the occurrence of severe ionized hypocalcemia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Hypocalcemia appears to be time-dependent and due essentially to extracellular complexing of calcium. Further work is needed to determine whether patients who have out-of-hospital cardiac arrests can benefit from calcium administration.\r"

Within 100 ms, air puff stimulation of the face elicited three negative and three positive components over the contralateral, as well as the ipsilateral, sensory area. The air puff TSEPs showed a uniform change in peak latencies and amplitudes as a function of stimulus intensity. The bilateral distribution of the TSEPs stands in sharp contrast to the exclusively contralateral distribution of the SEPs to stimulation of the hand. Air puffs evoked a larger response than electrical stimulation, although the latency remained the same. Unlike electrical stimuli, air puff induces neither stimulus nor muscle artifacts. This, combined with the higher amplitude of the recorded response, enhances the signal-to-noise ratio.\r"

In this study we used multivariate analysis to identify such factors and to determine whether the presence or absence of specific factors would influence treatment decisions, particularly the use of plasmapheresis. Data from 245 patients randomized into conventional and plasmapheresis arms were used to assess the time to walk independently (Grade 2), the time to improve one grade, and the percentage improved at 4 weeks. Individually, many factors were associated with outcome. In the multivariate analysis, four factors correlate with poorer outcomes: mean amplitude of compound muscle action potential on stimulating distally of 20% of normal or less, older age, time from onset of disease of 7 days or less, and need for ventilatory support. The most powerful predictor of outcome was the abnormal mean amplitude of compound muscle action potential on stimulating distally. Plasmapheresis, the only variable the physician can influence, has a beneficial effect over and above any or all of these factors. The plasmapheresis patients on continuous flow machines had better outcomes than those on intermittent flow machines. From these data, tables of expected outcome probabilities have been developed.\r"

  ".W": "The North American study of plasmapheresis in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) included early, standardized electrodiagnostic testing in 210 of the 245 patients. To determine the types of abnormalities and the relation to outcome, we analyzed the prospectively collected motor conduction data obtained during the first 30 days of illness. For each parameter of motor conduction data, means were computed based on institutional normal data. Mean distal motor and F wave latencies commonly were abnormal in these early studies. In univariate analysis, mean compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude from distal and proximal stimulation and mean motor conduction velocity were found to be related to the four predetermined outcome measures. In multivariate analysis of the motor conduction parameters, mean distal CMAP amplitude was the single best predictor of prognosis; other measures did not add to its predictive value. In further multivariate analysis of all factors relating to outcome, mean distal CMAP amplitude was determined to be the most powerful predictor of outcome, followed by plasmapheresis. These two factors were always statistically significant over and above all other variables. Our results indicate that prognostic information can be obtained from motor conduction studies even when performed early in the course of GBS; a mean distal CMAP amplitude of 0 to 20% of the lower limit of normal is associated with a markedly increased probability of a poor outcome. Nevertheless, even in patients with a low mean distal CMAP amplitude, the predicted outcome is improved with plasmapheresis therapy.\r"

Aphasia occurred only in demented subjects, and its prevalence increased with severity of dementia. Aphasia in mildly demented subjects was associated with both an earlier age of onset and more rapid progression of SDAT than in similarly demented nonaphasics. Language dysfunction in SDAT subjects was characterized by early decline in measures of comprehension and written expression, whereas other components, including oral naming, were less profoundly affected. Performance on the verbal psychometric measures, the Sentence Repetition and the Token tests, correlated strongly with Aphasia Battery scores and declined only minimally in nonaphasics, despite increasing dementia. We conclude that aphasia is a common feature of SDAT subjects and identifies a subgroup with more rapid progression of dementia. Furthermore, it represents language-specific dysfunction beyond the global cognitive impairment of SDAT.\r"

Unlike conventional pathological stains that reveal only neurons with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), Alz-50 recognizes neurons that contain NFTs and additional neurons that do not. Our investigation of the topographical distribution of both NFT-containing and non-NFT-containing neurons recognized by Alz-50 reveals that they are both found primarily in certain cytoarchitectural areas and lamina that have been established as consistent sites for NFT pathology. Some of the neurons recognized by Alz-50 appear histopathologically normal. We suggest that Alz-50 recognizes an antigen in neurons that both precedes and accompanies NFT formation. Thus, it may mark a point early in cellular pathology before irreversible cytoskeletal and degenerative changes occur.\r"

Central nervous system (CNS) lesions were present in half the patients; embolic brain infarcts (10 patients) and CNS infections (8 patients) were the most common. Cardiac sources of emboli were Libman-Sacks endocarditis (5 patients), chronic valvulitis (2 patients), and left side of heart mural thrombus (2 patients). There was no evidence of active CNS vasculitis. Clinical features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) developed during the terminal illness in 14 patients, 7 of whom also had pathological evidence of TTP. Correlation between neuropsychiatric disorders and brain lesions could be made in approximately half the patients. This study indicates that cardiac emboli from Libman-Sacks endocarditis and TTP are common pathogenetic factors of CNS disease in systemic lupus erythematosus, whereas CNS vasculitis is rare.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils (PMNs) obtained by nasal lavage were counted to determine if ozone, an oxidant air pollutant, induces an acute inflammatory response in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of humans. Background data were obtained by the nasal lavages from 200 nonexperimentally exposed subjects. Then, using a known inflammatory agent for the URT, rhinovirus-type 39, the induction, peak, and resolution of an acute inflammatory response was shown to be documented by the nasal lavage PMN counts. To determined if ozone induces this response, 41 subjects were exposed to either filtered air or 0.5 ppm ozone for 4 hr, on 2 consecutive days. Nasal lavages were taken pre-, immediately post each exposure, and 22 hr following the last exposure. Lavage PMN counts increased significantly (p = .005) in the ozone-exposed group, with 3.5-, 6.5-, and 3.9-fold increases over the air-exposed group at the post 1, pre 2, and post 2 time points, respectively. Ozone induces an inflammatory response in the URT of humans, and nasal lavage PMN counts are useful to assay the inflammatory properties of air pollutants.\r"

We examined recall in 22 of 31 subjects exposed to fumes from ruptured drums containing nitric acid during a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-supervised hazardous waste site clean up operation in August 1983. Exposed subjects were interviewed by emergency room staff immediately after the episode and the next morning by telephone by a public health epidemiologist. Six months later, the subjects were again interviewed by telephone and asked to report the symptoms they had experienced during the incident. For each respondent, symptoms recalled at 6 mo were compared to symptoms reported at the time. We found a low level of agreement compared to that expected by chance, associated with significant nonrandom differences in the distribution of responses consistently favoring selective recall on the later interview. We conclude that allowing time to elapse before obtaining data on individual symptoms following exposure may lead to a significant bias in response.\r"

There were also signs of a decreasing secular trend in the odds ratios for deaths from this cause between 1926 and 1985, with no difference between the two groups over the past 20 yr. There was no statistically significant excess in the number of deaths from malignant neoplasms, either in general or for specific sites. Previous evidence of an increased risk of death from cerebrovascular disease is therefore confirmed, but it would seem that with the introduction of stricter standards of lead control that this has now disappeared, as has any marginal risk of death from malignant disease.\r"

Follow-up averaged 24 months with a two-year survival of 91%.

Median survival for all patients with malignant disease was 13 months. Survival after resection did not correlate with the Clark level of the original lesion, lymph node status, disease-free interval, or number of nodules on preoperative tomograms. Two of 10 patients with 1 nodule resected are long-term survivors (88 and 120 months). Exploration in patients with presumed pulmonary metastases from melanoma is justified to rule out benign disease even if a new solitary nodule is detected. There are no prognostic indicators predicting survival after resection of melanoma metastases, and a significant number of patients will have benign disease.\r"

The overall 5-year survival was 69%. Late deaths were caused most commonly by myocardial infarction (20/32) with only 7 due to CHF. Predictors of long-term survival were related to LV function preoperatively: absence of CHF (p = 0.001); LV end-diastolic pressure less than or equal to 20 mm Hg (p = 0.03); and ejection fraction greater than or equal to 35% (p = 0.02). Factors that did not significantly affect long-term survival were type of aneurysm repair (resection or plication), morphology of left anterior descending coronary artery (occlusion or stenosis), and size of the aneurysm.\r"

The groups with and without vena caval tumors were compared, and the operative approach is described. Although the rate of complications was higher in operations on the vena cava, none were fatal and no patient required chronic dialysis. Life-table analysis revealed that patients with involvement of the inferior vena cava survived longer than those with incomplete resection. Because extraction of these tumors can be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and mortality, because complete resection confers a survival advantage, and because chemotherapy and radiation are ineffective, we recommend aggressive workup and resection of renal tumors involving the inferior vena cava.\r"

The addition of radiation therapy can result in damage to the lung and adjacent viscera and also potentiate pulmonary restrictive disease. Between 1971 and 1978, 9 patients were treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and combination chemotherapy (three- or four-drug regimen). Only 2 patients (22%) survive. Since 1979, 14 patients were entered into a new protocol consisting of sequential induction chemotherapy, followed by delayed surgical resection whenever feasible. Three patients had complete resection of their primary lesion at onset. Initially, 7 patients had either biopsy (N = 4) or incomplete chest wall resection N = 3). All 4 patients with biopsy only at diagnosis had excellent responses to induction chemotherapy, allowing delayed resection of the involved rib without chest wall resection. Overall, 12 of 14 patients (86%) treated since 1979 survive, with only 2 receiving radiation therapy for residual disease in the primary rib site.\r"

All patients had positive mediastinal cultures. The first 8 patients were managed traditionally by debridement and irrigation. Three of these patients suffered serious metabolic complications related to the povidone-iodine irrigant, which resulted in 1 death. Another patient died from persistent sepsis following debridement. Subsequently, 13 patients were managed by early debridement and rotation of the pectoralis major or rectus abdominis muscle flaps, or both. Following muscle flap rotation and early wound closure, 2 patients had subsequent incisional complications. One patient had incisional dehiscence and 1 had a superficial skin separation. Two deaths in this group, 28 and 51 days, respectively, following muscle flap rotation, resulted from nonincisional problems in patients with healed median sternotomies. The group having muscle flap rotation required a significantly shorter duration of postoperative ventilatory support (3.2 versus 24 days, p less than 0.05) and a significantly shorter confinement in the intensive care unit (6.2 versus 33 days, p less than 0.01). Also, the physiological and physical trauma of continued wound care in the awake child was minimized in the group with muscle flap rotation.\r"

  ".W": "Complement activation by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was studied in 82 patients divided into membrane (MOG) and bubble oxygenator groups (BOG). The influence of primed homologous to circulating autologous blood volume (H/A) ratio was also evaluated. C4a increased very slowly during CPB in both groups, maintaining slightly higher levels in the BOG than in the MOG, with the exception of a marked initial rise in the BOG with a high H/A ratio (greater than or equal to 20%). Anaphylatoxin C3a levels increased more steeply in the BOG than in the MOG. An obvious rise in anaphylatoxin C5a production was observed in the BOG alone. The influence of high H/A ratio perfusion on complement activation was milder in the MOG than in the BOG. In 20 monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), continuous intraaortic infusion with bubbled autologous blood increased C4a and C3a levels, while autologous blood extracorporeally contacted with nylon increased C3a levels alone. In vitro studies revealed that human immunoglobulin fractions denatured by oxygen bubbling produced C4a, C3a, and C5a in a dose-dependent manner, although human albumin treated identically as human immunoglobulin did not produce these complements. It was thus inferred that (1) during CPB, complement is predominantly activated via the classical pathway in the BOG and via the alternative pathway in the MOG; (2) higher anaphylatoxin levels in the BOG than in the MOG are related to mode and grade of blood trauma; (3) anaphylatoxin level differences in both groups tend to increase with high H/A perfusion; and (4) immunoglobulin-free sera may reduced classical pathway activation.\r"

A variety of wire-guides, dilators, and tracheal tubes were used as experience and proficiency were gained with the approach, and eventually, a simple modification of a standard low-pressure cuffed endotracheal tube was found to facilitate the procedure. The percutaneous method was found to be rapid and simple, to leave almost no cosmetic deformity, and to be almost totally free from infectious complications.

The overall operative death rate was 10.9%, but no patient has died since 1975 (32 survivors). Seven patients had a postoperative empyema (12.7%); 4 of these patients had a bronchopleural fistula. Twenty-five patients had postoperative radiotherapy, 5 of whom also had chemotherapy. The actuarial survival rate, after exclusion of the 6 operative deaths, was 38% at 3 years and 23% at 5 years. Survival was correlated to regional lymph node involvement. The actuarial survival rate among patients with tumoral spread to bronchial lymph nodes was 43% at 3 years. Among the 13 patients with only subcarinal involvement, the actuarial survival rate was 34% at 3 years. None of the 8 patients with paratracheal lymph node involvement survived more than 30 months. These results indicate that tracheal sleeve pneumonectomy for bronchogenic carcinoma with extension to the carina is now fully justified considering the low operative mortality and the good results observed when lateral tracheal lymph nodes were not involved.\r"

Patients included 19 men and 25 women, ranging in age from 24 to 66 years (mean age, 47.2 years). Mean IBA was 12.7 +/- 4.2 [SD] degrees in 14 valves implanted for 7 years or less and 16.4 +/- 5.8 degrees in 30 valves implanted 8 years or longer (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in IBA among valves based on type (25 Hancock valves, 15.0 +/- 4.7 degrees; 10 Angell-Shiley valves, 16.2 +/- 8.6 degrees; and 9 Carpentier-Edwards valves, 14.4 +/- 3.7 degrees). There was a significant difference in IBA based on valve size (37 valves measuring 25-29 mm in diameter, 16.3 +/- 5.1 degrees; and 7 valves measuring 31 mm in diameter, 9.9 +/- 5.1 degrees; p less than 0.05). IBA showed a tendency to have a large value in a heart with a small left ventricular end-systolic volume. We conclude that (1) stent creep is not related to the materials or designs of the stent post, but tends to increase with passage of time in place; and (2) compression of the left ventricular wall is one of the main causes of stent-post bending.\r"

  ".W": "In 6 patients with pure aortic regurgitation, the velocity waveform in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was measured using an 80-channel 20-MHz-pulse Doppler velocimeter before and immediately after aortic valve replacement. All patients showed normal coronary angiograms. Flow velocity was analyzed by both zero-cross and fast Fourier transform methods in real time. The LAD flow in severe aortic regurgitation was characterized by an increase in the systolic flow component, a small and rapidly decreased diastolic flow, an irregular velocity profile across the vessel, and a wider velocity spectrum. After aortic valve replacement, systolic flow decreased by 36.3 +/- 21.7% (p less than 0.01), whereas diastolic flow increased by 81.4 +/- 51.8% (p less than 0.05). The ratio of diastolic flow to total LAD flow increased from 63 +/- 13% to 82 +/- 7% (p less than 0.05). The velocity profile became more parabolic and had a narrow spectrum. These results suggest that operation for aortic regurgitation induces beneficial effects on the myocardial inflow immediately after valve replacement.\r"

  ".W": "The coronary-subclavian steal syndrome involves the siphoning of blood from the myocardium through an internal mammary artery graft because of a proximal subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion, and results in myocardial ischemia. With the increased use of the internal mammary artery for myocardial revascularization, the potential exists for recurrence of angina pectoris in patients who have or in whom develops high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery, because of the coronary-subclavian steal syndrome. The coronary-subclavian steal syndrome can be prevented by the identification of patients with or at risk to develop subclavian artery occlusive disease. All patients undergoing cardiac catheterization prior to coronary artery bypass grafting in which use of the internal mammary artery is anticipated should be evaluated for the presence of upper extremity and cerebrovascular ischemia, the presence of cervical or supraclavicular bruits, and an upper extremity blood pressure differential of 20 mm Hg or greater. Patients with these findings or with evidence of diffuse atherosclerotic vascular disease should have brachiocephalic arteriography at the time of coronary arteriography to identify significant subclavian artery occlusive disease. When this is demonstrated, use of the internal mammary artery as a free graft instead of an in situ graft or use of saphenous vein grafts is indicated. Patients in whom recurrent angina develops following coronary artery bypass grafting that included an internal mammary artery graft should have coronary arteriography to evaluate the presence of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome, and brachiocephalic arteriography. Carotid-subclavian bypass grafting, probably best done with a prosthetic conduit, is the procedure of choice for management of the coronary-subclavian steal syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The 1985-1986 National Study of Internal Medicine Manpower asked directors of residency and fellowship programs about their plans to change the size of their programs in the near future. The vast majority (71% to 76%) of the directors expected their programs to remain about the same size for the next couple of years. For fellowship directors, this reflects a decline in the number planning to increase their program size since 1976-1977 from 32% to 18%. Directors of programs that are principal affiliates of medical schools are more likely to plan a decrease, while Veterans Administration directors are more likely to plan an increase in program size. The reason residency directors cited most frequently as important to their plans to increase program size was a perceived shortage of internists. Fellowship directors most frequently cited the need for fellows in clinical research. Stipend availability was the most important factor that influenced plans to decrease program size. Overall, residency and fellowship directors planned to increase the size of their programs around 1%. Program directors and others in the internal medicine community should consider how they can change the stipend availability, admissions criteria, and other incentives to channel trainees into the areas of greatest potential need and demand for the profession.\r"

Many antihypertensive drugs, however, are not well tolerated by the aged. We treated 21 patients (ten men and 11 women) between ages 65 and 84 years (mean, 73.6 years) with guanadrel sulfate. All patients had received prior antihypertensive therapy, which either was ineffective or caused undesirable side effects. Average follow-up time was 17 months. Mean systolic pressure on enrollment was 188 +/- 17 mm Hg and mean diastolic pressure was 100 +/- 10 mm Hg. After treatment, the mean systolic pressure was 139 +/- 15 mm Hg and mean diastolic pressure was 82 +/- 8 mm Hg. Dosage varied from 5 to 30 mg/d with a mean of 16 mg/d. The only significant side effects were fatigue, dizziness, and dyspnea reported in four patients. Eleven patients took the medication as monotherapy and ten received diuretics or diuretics and beta-blockers as additional therapy. Our conclusion is that guanadrel is an effective, well-tolerated medication for treatment of hypertension in the elderly.\r"

Ischemic heart disease was an additional independent risk factor for congestive heart failure. Significantly more of those patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were smokers and none were hypertensive, whereas all those patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were hypertensive. The prevalence of hypertrophic hyperkinetic disease was 11%, of dilated cardiomyopathy 18%, and of symptomatic ischemic heart disease 18%. We concluded that congestive heart failure in dialysis patients is associated not only with dilated cardiomyopathy but also with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease that requires echocardiography for diagnosis and that has different risk factors and management.\r"

Seventy-five percent of nursing homes accept DNR orders, while 35% accept DNH orders. The most common qualifying condition for a DNR/DNH order was the approval of the family. Although 32 homes stated that they have written protocols, only eight were made available for review. The authors concluded that DNR orders are widely accepted in nursing homes in northwestern Ohio. However, DNH orders are less likely to be accepted in northwest Ohio long-term facilities and the use of written protocols is even more limited.\r"

To determine the significance of this, 41 patients with PTFV1 greater than or equal to 0.04 mms were recalled for a repeated electrocardiogram as well as an echocardiographic examination. Patients were classified as cardiovascular normal (n = 15) or abnormal (n = 26). Left atrial enlargement was the most common echocardiographic abnormality found, but represented less than a third of the total. P-wave prolongation (greater than 110 ms) was present in 30 of the 41 patients and 21 of the 26 abnormal patients. This persisted into the second study, while the PTFV1 fell significantly in both the normal and abnormal groups. Among the P-wave abnormalities found, combinations were used to identify patients most likely to have cardiovascular disease. The most discriminating was an initial abnormal PTFV1 in combination with P-wave prolongation (sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 40%; positive predictive value, 70%; and negative predictive value, 55%). Maximal specificity (93%) and positive predictive value (88%) were achieved when P-wave prolongation and PTFV1 greater than or equal to 0.06 mms were present in both studies, although the sensitivity for this criterion was only 27%. The isolated P-wave abnormality described may be helpful in suggesting the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease and indicate the need for further evaluation.\r"

Performance status was the most important clinical factor in estimating survival time, but five other symptoms had independent predictive value as well (shortness of breath, problems eating or anorexia, trouble swallowing, dry mouth, and weight loss). We generated four parametric accelerated time survival models to estimate survival in patients with combinations of these symptoms and validated the log-normal model on the entire data set. This model was unaffected by patient age, sex, primary tumor type, or site. Our findings illustrate the value of biologically \"soft\" clinical data in predicting survival in patients with terminal cancer. The prevalence of similar symptoms among patients with cancer of various primary and metastatic sites also supports the concept of a common final clinical pathway in patients with advanced malignant neoplasms.\r"

  ".U": "88251217\r", 
  ".W": "Although it is often claimed that the presence of a single polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is abnormal, recently some have suggested that a few PMNs are occasionally present in cytocentrifuged differential cell counts of normal CSF. We examined 225 consecutive normal CSF specimens to determine how frequently PMNs occur in normal CSF and to identify factors associated with the presence of PMNs. One or more PMNs were present in 73 cases (32%). The number of CSF PMNs was strongly correlated with the degree of CSF blood contamination and the hematologic PMN count. Of the 163 specimens having 25 red blood cells or less per cubic millimeter, only eight (5%) had three or more PMNs, and these outliers had abnormally high hematologic PMN counts. Of the 36 specimens having 100 red blood cells or more per cubic millimeter, 17 (47%) had six or more PMNs. We conclude that the number of PMNs found on cytocentrifuged differential cell counts is highly dependent on the degree of CSF blood contamination and the patient's hematologic PMN count and that even minimal blood contamination can result in the presence of one to two PMNs in normal CSF.\r"

  ".W": "Occasionally patients with overlapping features of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), termed \"rhupus,\" have been encountered. We wanted to ascertain the frequency of such patients and determine whether they represent a unique overlap syndrome. Of approximately 7000 new patients evaluated over 11 years, we identified six patients who had, on the average, 6.7 American Rheumatism Association criteria for RA and 4.2 criteria for SLE. Criteria for RA included chronic symmetric arthritis with morning stiffness (six patients); subcutaneous nodules (two patients); positive rheumatoid factors test (four patients); and radiologic erosions (four patients). The criteria for SLE included malar rash (three patients); discoid lupus erythematosus (two patients); biopsy-proved nephritis (one patient); photosensitivity (one patient); leukopenia/thrombocytopenia (four patients); positive antinuclear antibodies or lupus erythematosus cell test (six patients); hypocomplementemia (two patients); and abnormal results from skin biopsy (two patients). During observations of up to ten years, the conditions of three patients were stable or improved, one died, and two were unavailable for follow-up. Patients usually did not have conditions that evolved to classic rheumatic disease patterns. Rhupus was not common and did not occur more frequently (0.09% prevalence among our patients) than expected from chance concurrence of SLE and RA (calculated at 1.2%). These observations confirm that rhupus indeed exists as a syndrome manifested by patients sharing features of probable coincidental concurrence of RA and SLE, but not as a unique clinical pathologic or immunologic syndrome. Appreciation of these patients with rhupus is important since their therapy and outcome differ from those having RA or SLE alone.\r"

We therefore assessed bone turnover with technetium Tc 99m medronate in 16 patients with persistent polyarthralgias who had no clinical synovitis, normal radiographs, and nondiagnostic results from laboratory evaluations. Abnormal scans were found in 11 of 16; five were unremarkable. Scan abnormality corresponded with symptomatic joints (11 of 11 patients). These 11 patients had normal test results for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and HLA-B27. Patients with abnormal scans were treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or analgesics (11 of 11), hydroxychloroquine sulfate (four), or gold salts (one), with improvement (nine of 11); patients with normal scans (five of five) were treated successfully with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or analgesics and reassurance. One patient with a normal scan developed sarcoidosis; one, hypermobility syndrome; and one, a viral syndrome. Two patients had no diagnosis. Abnormal technetium Tc 99m medronate scans in patients with previously undiagnosed polyarthralgias suggested inflammatory arthropathy and influenced management decisions with favorable therapeutic outcomes.\r"

We also found that unlike normals, patients failed to activate DLPFC during the WCS over their own baseline (NM) level. To explore the reproducibility of these findings, a new cohort of 16 medication-free patients underwent a series of xenon 133 inhalation rCBF studies under the following conditions: at rest, while performing the WCS, and while performing NM. The results confirmed our earlier findings. In addition, the concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid correlated with prefrontal rCBF during the WCS but not during the NM test or at rest. The results show that behavior-specific hypofunction of DLPFC in schizophrenia is reproducible, and they implicate a monoaminergic mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies we found that patients with chronic schizophrenia had lower regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than did normal subjects during performance of the Wisconsin Card Sort Test, an abstract reasoning task linked to DLPFC function. This was not the case during less complex tasks. To examine further whether this finding represented regionally circumscribed pathophysiology or a more general correlate of abstract cognition, 24 medication-free patients and 25 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects underwent rCBF measurements with the xenon 133 technique while they performed two tasks: Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and an active baseline control task. While performing RPM, normal subjects activated posterior cortical areas over baseline, but did not activate DLPFC, as had been seen during the Wisconsin Card Sort Test. Like normal subjects, patients showed maximal rCBF elevations posteriorly and, moreover, they had no significant DLPFC or other cortical deficit while performing RPM. These results suggest that DLPFC dysfunction in schizophrenia is linked to pathophysiology of a regionally specific neural system rather than to global cortical dysfunction, and that this pathophysiology is most apparent under prefrontally specific cognitive demand.\r"

In 81% of schizophrenic patients patterned deficits incompatible with generalized losses of function were disclosed. Patterns were heterogeneous and characterized by (1) the frequency and severity of left temporohippocampal impairment; (2) asymmetric frontohippocampal function such that severity of bilateral impairment was associated with poorer nonspatial learning and superior performance with better nonspatial learning; (3) syndrome relationships predicted by the hemisphere imbalance syndrome model pertaining to positive and negative symptoms and the catatonic syndrome; (4) a generalized deficit independent of temporohippocampal functions; and (5) no relationship between performance and computed tomographic signs or medication.

Schizophrenics had slightly larger ventricles and considerably larger sulci than controls. Enlargement of the ventricles and sulci was not correlated with measures of negative symptoms or neuropsychological impairment. The CT scans of eight very ill chronically institutionalized schizophrenics were also analyzed. Their CT findings did not differ significantly from the larger group of schizophrenics studied. Our results show that the cerebral atrophy found in schizophrenia is diffuse in nature and does not relate clearly to measures of disease severity or chronicity.\r"

The regression curve crossed the x-axis at D = 0.6 mm, showing that arteries thicker than this have an auxiliary circulation by vasa vasorum. The LA was markedly high both in neonates and in patients with cyanotic heart anomaly, ie, in conditions where medial cells were sustained under reduced oxygen supply. Thus, vasa vasorum were shown to elongate their intramural segments in response to the changes of microenvironment in which the medial cells are placed, meeting the demand by the cells for increased supply of oxygen and nutrients.\r"

Forty surgical and autopsy bladder specimens (23 males, 17 females) showing CC or CG were studied using anti-prostate specific antigen and anti-prostate specific acid phosphatase antibodies. Fourteen (35%) of these 40 cases showed positive staining for prostate specific antigen or prostate specific acid phosphatase or both in CC or CG foci. Among these were five female patients. The findings indicate that bladder epithelium is capable of undergoing prostatelike metaplasia and lend support to the hypothesis that the adult bladder stroma closest to the prostate may exert inductive influences on the overlying epithelium to show prostatelike metaplasia.\r"

Systemic necrotizing arteritis was found in three cases, all of which were complicated by secondary ulceration or infarction of the colon.

Histopathologic features of the parotid gland specimens included atypical follicular hyperplasia and follicular involution, resembling lymph node changes of HIV infection. The clinical and pathologic findings in these cases suggest an association between HIV infection and BLL, and support a previously proposed mechanism for the development of BLL through progressive enlargement of intraparotid lymph nodes.\r"

Acute chorioamnionitis and funisitis were present significantly more often in cases with genital mycoplasma than in those without these organisms. Isolation of genital mycoplasmas was not associated with an increased incidence of intrauterine fetal death, villitis, hyaline membrane disease, congenital anomalies, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes in alveolar spaces.

Pathological studies indicated that high-grade tumors, necrosis, infiltrating margin, and the presence of more than one mesenchymal element were often associated with aggressive behavior. Flow-cytometric analyses of DNA aneuploidy and proliferative index supported the grading system we used, since all four malignant cases examined showed high proliferative index, and three of the four cases showed aneuploidy. None of the low-grade cases, including the recurrent ones, showed increased proliferative index or aneuploidy. We believe that flow-cytometric analysis ought to be performed on cases in which there is doubt regarding the potential malignancy.\r"

From 1974 to 1985, 30 consecutive patients underwent radical pancreatic resection for the treatment of debilitating pain (15 underwent Whipple's resection and 15 underwent total pancreatectomy). Patients were not randomized but were subjected to the procedure deemed indicated for their clinical presentation; thus, the two groups were not strictly comparable. There was no operative mortality; major morbidity occurred in three patients (20%) in each group (four patients experienced anastomotic bile leak and two experienced abdominal sepsis). Following Whipple's resection, mean follow-up was 6.2 years (range, 1.5 to 12.1 years). Complete pain relief occurred in eight patients (53%) and significant relief in an additional four (27%). Endocrine insufficiency developed in six patients and exocrine insufficiency in eight. Following total pancreatectomy, mean follow-up was 9.1 years (range, 2.1 to 13.1 years). Complete pain relief occurred in only four patients (27%) and significant relief in an additional six (40%). Significant pain persisted in about 33% of patients after total pancreatic resection. We concluded that radical pancreatic resection can be performed safely in patients with chronic pancreatitis but with gratifying results in only 67% to 80% of patients. Whipple's resection may be preferable for disease located primarily in the head of the gland.\r"

Diaphragm rupture is difficult to diagnose; it was not initially recognized in 69% of cases. Chest roentgenogram was often nondiagnostic. Peritoneal lavage gave false-negative results. We ultimately failed to diagnose diaphragm rupture in only three cases. We attributed our low incidence of missed injury to an aggressive approach in the severely injured patient population, where exploratory laparotomy is a routine part of the complete evaluation. One third of the ruptures were on the right side. The complication rate was 82%, excluding a mortality rate of 40.5%. High morbidity and mortality were related primarily to associated injuries.\r"

An EPICS V flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, Fla) was used. Measurements were taken from paraffin-embedded tissue. Isolated nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. The study was conducted in a blinded fashion. Observed NDC and PDY patterns were classified as diploid, aneuploid, or suspicious. Twenty-nine lesions (81%) were diploid and seven (19%) were aneuploid. Twelve (33%) HCNs were malignant, 23 (64%) were benign, and one (3%) was indeterminate. Eight (67%) of 12 malignant HCNs were diploid and four (33%) of 12 were aneuploid. In comparison, 20 (87%) of 23 benign lesions were diploid and three (13%) of 23 were aneuploid. The indeterminate neoplasm was diploid. There were three deaths in this group of patients; all three had aneuploid neoplasms, and all had locally recurrent disease with distant metastases. There was a significant cross correlation between histologic features and DNA content with regard to outcome. These preliminary data suggest that NDC and PDY are not helpful in distinguishing histologically benign from malignant HCNs; however, they may be useful in determining prognosis.\r"

Of 63 patients with gastrointestinal involvement at sites other than the appendix, who did not undergo bowel resection, only two patients had gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of diagnosis (neither patient had obstructive symptoms); follow-up has revealed that only one patient subsequently developed significant gastrointestinal symptoms. Fifteen patients had appendiceal endometriosis, but none had symptoms suggestive of appendicitis. Indications for resection of gastrointestinal endometriosis include the presence of clear-cut obstructive symptoms or the inability to exclude malignancy. The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms appears to be predictive of the absence of clinically significant intestinal endometriosis, and bowel resection is not indicated in the asymptomatic patient. Appendiceal endometriosis appears to be an incidental finding and one that is not clinically important.\r"

Autogenous vein was used for 79 grafts (59%), polytetrafluoroethylene for 53 grafts (39%), and a composite for three grafts (2%). Perioperative antibiotics were administered to 130 patients (96%). Wound complications were separated into four categories: class 1, erythema or seroma without tissue breakdown; class 2, ischemic necrosis along an incision without infection; class 3, wound breakdown with infection; and class 4, open wound with exposed graft. Ninety incisions (67%) healed without incident. There were 21 class 1 (15%), 17 class 2 (13%), four class 3 (3%), and three class 4 (2%) complications. Serious wound problems were more frequent after bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts compared with vein grafts. Three prosthetic graft infections resulted in two amputations. Eight other factors were not predictive of wound breakdown. Wound complications after infrainguinal bypass are frequent. Management should be selective, based on the degree of severity.\r"

We identified 378 patients with intermittent claudication by characteristic history and the presence of abnormal treadmill exercise examination results. Results of serial examinations were available for 195 of these patients, who had 310 claudicating limbs. Life-table analysis revealed that after eight years, 41% of these patients had progressed to critical ischemia, defined as rest pain or tissue loss, and 50% had died. Cox proportional hazards general linear regression analysis found that at a patient's first examination in the vascular laboratory, the ankle-brachial index and the decrease in ankle-brachial index after exercise were significantly associated with the subsequent development of critical ischemia. The level of disease at the initial examination in the vascular laboratory was not a significant risk factor for progression to critical ischemia and therefore should not be used as an indicator for or against operation in patients with intermittent claudication.\r"

Overall mortality was 15% with a 9.6% mortality for elective repair. Nonfatal complications occurred in 44% of patients and included myocardial infarction in 9%, paraplegia in 5%, and renal failure in 4%. In an attempt to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with TAAA repair, one of our vascular surgical services set up a routine protocol of preoperative evaluation, standardized operative technique, and specific guidelines for perioperative management. Fifty-five of the 101 patients underwent elective repair on this service without the use of shunts or bypass. Mortality was reduced to 1.8% and the rate of myocardial infarction was reduced to 1.8%; none of these patients developed renal failure. However, paraplegia/paraparesis still occurred in 5.4% and pulmonary insufficiency occurred in 29%. Preoperative cardiac evaluation and intraoperative reduction of cardiac afterload are important factors in reducing myocardial infarction and death associated with TAAA repair and should be integrated into the management of these patients. However, preexisting pulmonary and renal disease in some patients may limit the surgeon's ability to reduce rates of some complications.\r"

Affected patients usually develop venous thrombosis as adults. During a 15-month interval, we identified five patients with venous thrombosis accompanied by protein C deficiency. Four patients presented with deep venous thrombosis, which was recurrent in two, and one patient developed mesenteric venous thrombosis. The kindred of this last patient suggested an autosomal dominant genetic transmission of protein C deficiency. Patients' ages at the time of diagnosis of disease ranged from 28 to 41 years. All patients had low levels of protein C (range, 34 to 67 U/dL; normal, 70 to 130 U/dL). All patients were treated with heparin sodium immediately and then given long-term oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium. Protein C deficiency is a predisposing factor to the development of venous thrombosis that has only recently been recognized. Treatment of symptomatic protein C deficiency requires short-term heparin therapy followed by long-term oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Oral anticoagulation treatment must be initiated slowly with no loading dose to avoid warfarin-associated skin necrosis. Patients with unexplained or unusual thrombosis, especially if it occurs at an early age, and patients with recurrent episodes of lower limb venous thrombosis should have their protein C levels measured. If a deficiency is documented, long-term warfarin anticoagulation therapy is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "The majority of reports concerning nonpuerperal breast abscess (NPBA) identify aerobic and facultative bacterial isolates as the predominant flora in this disease. In the present study, fine-needle aspiration was performed in 29 women with NPBA; 12 (41%) of the patients had a history of chronic NPBA. The mean age of patients was 39.2 years. The aspirated material was cultured both anaerobically and aerobically. A total of 108 bacterial strains were recovered from 32 specimens; two specimens yielded no bacterial growth. A mean of 3.6 different bacteria were recovered from each culture-positive specimen. Anaerobic recovery outweighed aerobic-facultative recovery by a factor of 2:1. Significantly, 37 strains (five aerobes and 32 anaerobes) were harvested only from enriched broth subcultured for four to 14 days after initial culture processing. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (60% of total aerobes) and peptostreptococci (47% of total anaerobes) were the predominant bacterial isolates. These findings indicate that NPBA is due to a mixed flora with a major anaerobic component. Furthermore, the results suggest that routine cultures often overlook the involvement of anaerobes in these infections.\r"

No prospectively studied infant had congenital heart block. The presence of neonatal lupus did not correlate with the titer of anti-Ro antibodies. During the same time period, 2 additional babies with neonatal lupus and congenital heart block were born to mothers not previously known to have SLE. Taken together, these findings confirm the association of anti-Ro antibody with neonatal lupus, but indicate that life-threatening neonatal lupus is rare in children born to mothers who are known to have SLE, even when antibodies to Ro, La, or RNP are present. Prophylactic therapy is therefore not indicated for these women. An important proportion of mothers bearing children with neonatal lupus do not have recognized SLE and, currently, cannot be prospectively identified.\r"

The measurement of this construct requires the identification of unique and relevant components of health status that can be operationally defined by specific scales or scale groupings. We explored the components of health status that are operationalized by the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS). Prior testing has shown that the AIMS measures delineate at least 3 components of health status: Physical Function, Psychological Status, and Pain. This 3-component model, however, can be theoretically and empirically restrictive. Using AIMS responses from a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient population, our investigation, through factor analyses, identifies 5 components of health status in this chronic disease: Lower Extremity Function, Upper Extremity Function, Affect, Symptom, and Social Interaction. It is proposed that these intuitively reasonable and measurable components constitute the core of the health status construct for individuals with RA. These 5 components could also prove central to the assessment of health status in other rheumatic diseases. Future studies of health status in RA should include tested measures to assess these 5 components.\r"

The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of TA per 100,000 population age 50 years or older was 17.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.6-20.5), with a marked increase in incidence with age and a threefold greater incidence in women (23.4, 95% CI 18.2-28.7) than in men (7.4, 95% CI 3.7-11.0). The previously described secular increase in TA incidence in Olmsted County women continued from 1970 through 1985, while TA incidence in men declined in this latter time period. Although the frequency of classic clinical manifestations of TA declined over time, the percentage of patients undergoing biopsy who have positive specimens remained relatively constant (women 41%, men 26%). The incidence rate of temporal artery biopsy also increased for women during this period, but declined for men, suggesting that the differing trends in TA incidence by sex may be partially attributable to a detection bias. Future research in TA etiology and epidemiology should focus on possible causal factors linked to the differential TA incidence by sex.\r"

There were no differences in Ia and Tac expression or DNA synthesis among the different juvenile rheumatoid arthritis subgroups.

The time interval until the pain was relieved, as well as any untoward effects, were recorded for each gout attack treated. Both groups were of similar age, and had similar values for intercritical serum uric acid, 24-hour urinary uric acid, and creatinine clearance (1 month after entry into the study). The mean interval (+/- SD) to relief of pain was significantly shorter for the ACTH group (3 +/- 1 hours) than for the indomethacin group (24 +/- 10 hours). No side effects were noted in the ACTH group. However, of the 40 patients receiving indomethacin, 22 had abdominal discomfort of dyspepsia, 15 had headaches, and 12 had difficulty with mentation. Single-dose parenteral ACTH appeared to be effective more rapidly and was associated with fewer side effects than oral indomethacin in the treatment of acute gout.\r"

The more common myocutaneous flaps for large defects are the pectoralis major, trapezius, and latissimus dorsi flaps. The lower trapezius flap, which is used for reconstruction of large lateral facial defects, is a relatively thin flap. The rhombotrapezius flap described in this article provides bulk for augmentation of facial defects. The flap, which includes the trapezius and rhomboid muscles, also offers a longer pedicle with a greater arc of rotation. This flap may include the medial border of the scapula when bone is necessary. The addition of the rhomboid muscles incorporates the dorsal scapular artery, which gives an additional blood supply to the flap. We believe that the rhombotrapezius, myocutaneous, and osteomyocutaneous flaps have a significant advantage over previously described flaps in the treatment of defects that need greater bulk and length for adequate reconstruction.\r"

An understanding of the phenomenon is important if the clinician is to judge the effects of traumatic displacement of an orbital wall on globe positions and if the clinician is to design a reconstructive procedure to correct these changes. To study such relationships, we have designed physical models based on measurements of five dry human skulls. With these models, it has been possible to move a whole wall or part of a wall and, thereby, adjust the orbital volume. The experimental manipulations are useful in predicting the relationship of the orbital wall position and volume-information that can be ultimately used for diagnosis and reconstructive purposes.\r"

The transverse maxillary osteotomy with downfracturing of the entire palate and inferior maxilla has recently been adopted as a surgical option. Simultaneous bilateral wide surgical exposure is achieved in the maxillary, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal sinuses, nasal fossa, clivus, pterygopalatine fossa, and medial portion of the infratemporal fossa. Compared with other popular techniques, the transverse maxillary osteotomy provides excellent exposure for angiofibromas, clivus tumors, and other tumors of the central base of the skull and midface regions. The details of the procedure and relevant physiology of the osteotomized segment are presented. The safe attainment of wide surgical exposure will be demonstrated. This procedure has worldwide acceptance for orthognathic surgery and is easily adapted to head and neck oncologic surgery.\r"

Hartley guinea pigs were locally immunized in the duodenum (group A) and trachea (group B) with the particulate form of dinitrophenylated ovalbumin one week after systemic priming with the soluble form. Otitis media was then induced with the intratympanic inoculation of the antigen. The control animals (group C) received only intratympanic inoculation after systemic priming. The mean titers of salivary IgA antibody of groups A and B were significantly greater than that of group C, and the mean value of serum IgG antibody titers of group C was significantly greater than those of groups A and B. The occurrences of otitis media in groups A and B were significantly suppressed, and histologic changes of the middle ear mucosa of groups A and B were slighter than those of group C. Antigen-specific IgA-forming cells were detected in the inflamed middle ear mucosa from group A and B animals, while these cells could not be found in group C animals. These results demonstrate the immunization strategy whereby the mucosal IgA immunity of the middle ear cavity can be effectively induced and enhanced to prevent otitis media.\r"

Potential pathogenic bacteria (Haemophilus species, S aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were identified in 40 patients. Seventy-three percent of these patients shared a common pathogen in tonsil and adenoid tissue. Haemophilus species were recovered in 54% of patients and S aureus in 46%. No significant difference exists between the type and number of pathogens in patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy for recurrent infection or obstruction.\r"

Nevertheless, these approaches fail to provide adequate exposure of the midfacial and interorbital spaces. In 1979, we developed a method called the transfacial approach in which two large midfacial flaps, one containing the entire external nose, are raised, exposing the maxillae, both medial orbital walls, and the nasal and paranasal cavities. Through this panoramic approach, one can easily expose the anterior skull base to the clivus and operate on this area under direct visual and manual control. The technique of this approach is described and our experience with 16 patients in whom it was applied is reviewed.\r"

For the primary closure of heavily irradiated fistulas, this combination may not always be effective, and we emphasize that a combined use of a pedicled pectoralis major muscle flap with these two kinds of pedicled skin flap is extremely reliable.\r"

The parameters of the Gompertz function differed significantly between the tumor lines. Tumor volume doubling time also varied during the course of growth. Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle phase distribution showed an initial decrease in the fraction of cells in S-phase, parallel with an increase in the fraction of cells in GO/1-phase. As much as 50% of the cells were mouse-derived in tumors less than 100 mm3 in volume, after which the proportion of mouse-derived cells decreased to below 10%.

Significant ST depression was recorded in 22 patients during exercise and in 24 during dobutamine infusion; the concordance between the two tests was 88%.

This disturbance of diastolic flow was studied in 50 healthy individuals and 40 patients with cardiopulmonary disease, some of whom had a pulmonary regurgitant murmur. Diastolic flow was disturbed in 39 of the 50 healthy individuals. In 32, cross sectional echocardiography gave a satisfactory image of the pulmonary valve. The characteristic Doppler signals usually lasted throughout diastole, were directed toward the right ventricular cavity, and gradually waned towards end diastole; they formed a spindle shaped area of abnormal signals that extended to within 10 mm of the coaptation of the pulmonary valve towards the right ventricular cavity and the pressure difference estimated from the signals by the modified Bernoulli equation seemed to be proportional to the normal retrograde transpulmonary pressure difference. In all 40 patients with cardiopulmonary disease, signals indicating pulmonary regurgitation were found whether or not a regurgitant murmur was present. When it was present, however, the spindle was longer than 20 mm and in patients with pulmonary hypertension the velocity of abnormal diastolic flow was higher than in healthy individuals. The Doppler signals registering disturbed flow in the healthy individuals resembled the signals caused by pulmonary regurgitation in the patients in terms of location, orientation, and configuration. These results show that healthy individuals usually have trivial pulmonary regurgitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Continuous wave Doppler echocardiography was performed before cardiac catheterisation in 69 consecutive patients with suspected aortic stenosis. Agreement between the maximum and the mean Doppler gradients and catheterisation gradients was good. Doppler echocardiography, however, systematically underestimated the maximum and mean gradients, particularly in the high range. Stepwise regression analysis of the small pressure difference between the two methods showed that it could not be explained by age, sex, stroke volume, differences in heart rate, ejection fraction, the presence of coronary artery disease, or severity of aortic regurgitation. There was a negative curvilinear correlation between the maximum and mean Doppler gradients and the aortic valve areas that were measured at catheterisation in patients with pure aortic stenosis. The degree of correlation decreased when patients with concomitant aortic regurgitation were included. The scatter of gradients above and below the correlation line was large and this was caused by low and high transvalvar flow. These results show that the usefulness of Doppler gradients for judging the severity of aortic stenosis, both in relation to immediate diagnosis and follow up, is severely limited if transvalvar flow is not taken into account.\r"

The most common abnormality of regional wall motion was mild hypokinesia. There were bulging or dyskinetic areas in seven patients. Regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle were found in five patients, two of whom also had bulging or dyskinetic areas. The reproducibility of right ventricular dimension, contractility, and regional wall motion scores was generally fair but varied unexpectedly both within and between two observers (Kendall's Tau 0.38-0.92). The score values of regional wall motion for some of the segments differed considerably within and between observers. One of the observers consistently gave higher scores than the other. These data suggest that a more objective approach is needed for evaluating angiographic changes in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.\r"

Holter monitoring, exercise stress test, and electrophysiological study (in three patients) showed that accelerated idioventricular rhythm was mainly bradycardia dependent, easily suppressed by effort and overdrive pacing, and originated from the outflow tract of the right ventricle. The mechanism could be enhanced automaticity. Data from cross sectional echocardiography (in all patients) and from haemodynamic evaluation (in three) identified structural or wall motion abnormalities of the right ventricle or both without appreciable dilatation of the ventricle. Biopsy specimens of the right ventricular endomyocardium showed fibrosis in one patient, fibrosis and fatty infiltration in the second, and pronounced fatty infiltration in the third. These results show that some patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm have right ventricular abnormalities that are typical of the localised and concealed forms of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.\r"

To assess the size and mechanism of such change, exercise capacity and pulsed Doppler left ventricular inflow velocities were assessed in 20 patients with established atrial fibrillation. Treadmill exercise capacity was assessed by measuring maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold before and on day 1 and 28 days after elective DC cardioversion. The relative contribution of atrial contraction to left ventricular filling was determined by relating the maximum height of the A wave to the maximum height of the E wave (A/E) of the Doppler velocity time curve. Cardioversion was successful in 14 patients. Maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold were unchanged on day 1 and increased by day 28 in all 14 patients. The percentage improvement was inversely related to the baseline values; however, the absolute improvement was small in all patients. The mean A/E ratio increased significantly from day 1 to day 28 in all 14 patients. Thus the restoration of sinus rhythm was associated with a delayed improvement in exercise capacity that may in part be due to a slow improvement in atrial contractility and peak cardiac output after cardioversion.\r"

Period death rates at various ages were calculated in those with congenital heart disease. Nearly all the deaths (848, 89.6%) occurred in the first year. Forty three (44% of survivors) died in the second year and 17 (31% of survivors) died between the second and fifth years. Over half (20) of the survivors died between the fifth and tenth years. Nearly half (44.2%) of those born with congenital heart disease who died before the age of 15 died in the first four weeks. About a third (29.1%) died in the first week and period death rates were 9.7%, 7.6%, and 5.7% for the second, third, and fourth weeks respectively. In neonates death rates were highest in those with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (89.2%), coarctation of the aorta (66.7%), truncus arteriosus (61.8%), double outlet right ventricle (57.1%), and pulmonary atresia (56.3%).\r"

The serum unconjugated oestriol level of each affected pregnancy was expressed as a multiple of the median (MoM) of its five matched controls. The unconjugated oestriol levels were significantly lower in the affected pregnancies than in the unaffected pregnancies; the median MoM was 0.79 (P less than 0.05). This association between low serum unconjugated oestriol and fetal Down's syndrome early in pregnancy raises the possibility that serum unconjugated oestriol measurement may be added to maternal age and alpha-fetoprotein measurement in the antenatal screening for Down's syndrome.\r"

Modification to the operation included redesign of the shape of the sling, use of increased tension where minor degrees of bladder detrusor instability exist, and use of a suprapubic catheter postoperatively. Of the 100 women 87 were reviewed directly and 12 indirectly; only one was lost to follow-up. After operation, 78% were continent, 17% showed improvement and there were 4% failures. The only serious complication was a pulmonary embolus in one woman but 15 had some voiding difficulty during the follow-up period which responded to urethral dilatation in all but three. There were no fistulas. This improved technique should overcome many of the objections to the sling procedure and is a suitable primary procedure for stress incontinence or for treatment of recurrence after previous alternative procedures.\r"

For staging purposes the Ann Arbor method appeared a more sensitive prognostic indicator than did the FIGO staging system. It is suggested that primary malignant lymphomas of the ovary are extremely rare and that for therapeutic purposes all lymphomas of the ovary should be regarded as local manifestations of systemic disease.\r"

Yeasts were present significantly more often in the IUCD users (20%) than in the control group (6%). In two of the 21 women with positive cultures the tail of the IUCD yielded substantially more colonies than the vaginal specimen and in seven, only the tail culture was positive. These findings strongly suggest that the IUCD is a predisposing factor in vaginal colonization by Candida strains. In half the women the presence of yeasts in the vagina was not associated with signs and symptoms of clinical infection. Of the 29 yeast strains isolated 17 were C. albicans, there was no difference in the prevalence of C. albicans between IUCD users and non-users or between symptomatic and asymptomatic women.\r"

The use of T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequences demonstrated both the presence and the evolution of thrombus within these lesions. High-velocity flow within the parent vessels and still-patent lumen could be defined as an area of absent signal. The use of even-echo rephasing (EER) sequences provided a rapid technique for demonstrating and confirming the presence of luminal flow, which is shown as areas of high signal. The combination of SE and EER techniques proved superior to CT in the assessment of thrombus and flow patterns in these lesions, as well as enabling superior demonstration of the patency of the parent vessel following surgical ligation. Computed tomography remains the most accurate method of defining the presence and location of associated calcification.\r"

Comparison of the scan appearances and clinical signs were made in all cases. Twelve of the patients had a repeat HMPAO scan 14 days later, together with further clinical assessment. Good correlation between the size and site of perfusion deficit and the clinical signs was found in 14 of the patients. When the results of the 12 patients who had repeat scans were examined at 14 days the correlation between the scan and the clinical signs was less accurate and it seems unlikely that the assessment of the size of cerebral infarction as demonstrated by an HMPAO scan will provide an accurate prognostic sign. Three of the patients, all of whom had suffered right hemiplegia and were dysphasic, had regions of increased uptake adjacent to the area of ischaemia and non deteriorated clinically; it is thought that this sign may represent hyperperfusion around infarction and indicates a fair prognosis. In patients suffering from transient neurological symptoms, the use of HMPAO may be useful by excluding the presence of other cerebral disease.\r"

  ".U": "88252605\r", 
  ".W": "Since all known chemotherapy and radiation treatments affect normal cells to a certain extent, the establishment of favourable differential sensitivities is fundamental to the success of treatment with a particular agent. This type of information can be gained by animal testing and using cultured cells, but ultimately use of the agent in the patient is the only way to determine the response. We have developed a model for testing the response of oesophageal explants from tumour and surrounding normal tissue in the same patient to chemotherapy and radiation, both singly and in combination. The test allows treatment combinations, time and order of administration of agents to the tissue to be accurately controlled. Cytotoxicity, determined by measuring the area of outgrowth from an explant 2 weeks after plating, is the most useful short-term end-point, although many others are possible. Results showing the differential cytotoxicity of bleomycin with and without radiation in squamous and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and surrounding normal tissue from the same patient indicate that tumour cells are relatively resistant to radiation alone, that low levels of bleomycin with or without radiation preferentially spare tumour cells and that high levels, in combination with any dose of radiation tested, but not without radiation, spare the normal cells and give a significantly high amount of relative tumour cell kill. Bleomycin must be added to the cells just before or just after irradiation to obtain the normal-tissue sparing effect. The technique may be a useful method for indicating the best approaches to the optimization of combined therapy regimes.\r"

Electronic penetrameters are now widely available, which allow improved accuracy in the measurement of tube kilovoltage, and the monitoring of waveforms. This has highlighted the necessity to refer to data which apply to the correct waveform ripple value, and to the correct tube target angle. A wide range of data referring to 10 degrees and 16 degrees target angles has been calculated. An experimental example is presented where measured values of HVT on nine X-ray tubes are converted to values of total filtration, using the calculated data.\r"

The superficial trigone responded maximally to alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation but also produced a significant cholinergic response. Intramural nerve stimulation in the presence of both atropine and phentolamine produced a residual non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) response of 40% of its maximum at 5 Hz. Electrical stimulation, particularly at the lower frequencies of stimulation, produced relaxation responses in 40% of the superficial trigonal muscle strips. These relaxations were not blocked by atropine, phentolamine or propranolol, but were abolished by tetrodotoxin. The possible role of the cholinergic \"input\" to the superficial trigone and the importance of the NANC excitatory and inhibitory innervation in preventing vesico-ureteric reflux and and in aiding bladder neck opening is discussed.\r"

The complication rate was 45% (of which 29% were designated \"sphincter-related\"). Half of these were accounted for by two complications: one was a change in bladder behaviour in patients with neuropathic bladders and the other was stress incontinence as a direct result of implanting low pressure devices. If these two factors and the \"sphincter-unrelated\" problems are discounted, the complication rate was 13%. The AUS is a satisfactory and successful method of treatment for sphincter weakness incontinence regardless of aetiology and the results suggest no contraindication to implantation at the same time as reconstructive surgery of the lower urinary tract.\r"

Our method was an aiming task in which the coordination of eye and hand movements was measured when the subject attempted to catch up with a visual target. The coordinated eye and hand movements started towards the target almost simultaneously in the normal subjects when the target was in the periphery of the visual area. The initial abnormality in parkinsonian patients was an isolated delay of coordinated hand movement. In the typical bradykinetic patients, the hand movement did not start while the target was still in the peripheral visual area but only when the image of the target was near or on the fovea. The aiming tasks were then performed step by step following visual confirmation. Thus patients with typical bradykinesia showed a failure of ballistic hand movement preprogrammed to the visual target in the peripheral visual area, and the strategy of coordination was changed. In contrast, the disturbance of the ballistic hand movement in the nonparkinsonian elderly subjects had no consistent strategy for coordination of the visually guided eye and hand movements.\r"

Few cases of bilateral anterior choroidal (AchA) artery territory infarction have been reported. We present 8 patients with ischaemic stroke in this location and vascular distribution who have a characterizable syndrome. All had the abrupt onset of inability to speak, swallow or phonate, accompanied by varying degrees of facial diplegia, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, lethargy, neglect and change in affect. The appearance of clinical signs depends upon the presence of a new infarct contralateral to an older lesion in mirror position. The pathogenesis and progression of neurological deficit appears to be intimately related to hypertension. The role of intrinsic intracranial vascular pathology related to diabetes mellitus, embolism of cardiac origin and atherosclerosis is currently undefined. The prognosis for recovery is poor. Half of our patients died within a year of onset of symptoms. Capsular pseudobulbar mutism is recognized by the abrupt appearance of neurological deficit consistent with internal capsular pathology and is confirmed by CT scan or MRI.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of remote memory function have indicated a dissociability between memory for the content and date of past events and suggested selective deficits of dating capacity in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study examined the hypothesis that poor dating in PD is linked to a specific deficit in temporal contextual memory which also affects new learning. Patients with PD and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were compared in their ability to perform tasks of content recognition and recency discrimination of words presented sequentially. Compared with AD patients, PD patients were disproportionately impaired in recency discrimination relative to content recognition. When performance was analysed as a function of retention interval, AD patients showed impairment in both tasks at all intervals. PD patients, by contrast, showed deficits in content recognition at the short stimulus-test intervals only, possibly reflecting the clinical phenomenon of bradyphrenia. These results suggest that recency discrimination deficits and impaired short-term memory processing are specific cognitive deficits in PD that may be linked to subcortical deafferentation of the frontal lobes.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical, pathological and immunocytochemical studies are described for 8 patients with cryoglobulinaemia and peripheral neuropathy: 5 had essential cryoglobulinaemia and 3 secondary cryoglobulinaemia. The cryoglobulins in 2 cases were type II (mixed cryoglobulins with a monoclonal component), type III (mixed polyclonal cryoglobulins) in 2 others, and were not characterized in 4. In all patients the neuropathy had an acute or subacute onset and in 7 it was initially asymmetric but, during the illness, in 3 it gradually progressed to a symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy. All patients had sural nerve biopsies. In 4 there was widespread vasculitis with necrosis of vessel walls and perivascular inflammatory cells. In another 2, thickening of vessel walls and luminal narrowing without inflammatory cell infiltration, together with loss of myelinated fibres from single fascicles or focally within fascicles, suggested that the neuropathy was of vascular origin. In all patients the main pathological damage was axonal degeneration. Signs of axonal regeneration were rare. The total number of myelinated fibres was reduced in all cases, from 24 to 95% below the lower limit of normal control values. Large diameter fibres were lost preferentially in 7 patients, being below 16.5% of the total number. Several possible pathogenetic mechanisms have been suggested for cryoglobulinaemic neuropathy, including immunologically mediated demyelination and ischaemic injury due to intravascular deposits of cryoglobulins or vasculitis. Our observations therefore confirm a major role for ischaemic factors, secondary to inflammatory vascular destruction, in the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy in most cases of types II and III cryoglobulinaemia.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of 5 commissurotomized patients to appreciate semantic anomalies presented to their right and left hemispheres was tested using both electrophysiological and behavioural measures. In all cases, the patients heard sentence fragments that were completed either by semantically congruous or incongruous words briefly flashed to the left visual field, right visual field or to both fields simultaneously. A dissociation between behavioural and event-related brain potential (ERP) measures was observed. All 5 patients were able to indicate by a pointing response with greater than chance accuracy whether the terminal word of a sentence made sense (i.e., appropriate for the context) or was nonsensical. This was true regardless of the hemisphere receiving the terminal word. Likewise, all the patients responded to right visual field anomalies with a cerebral potential (N400) that was typically elicited by such words in control subjects. In contrast, only those 2 patients who developed an overt speech capability under the control of the right hemisphere produced N400 waves in response to left visual field anomalies. These findings were interpreted as suggesting possible relationships within language generation and semantic priming.\r"
