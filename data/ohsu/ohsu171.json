However, its therapeutic potential, and that of other neuropeptides, is reduced by the blood-brain barrier that limits access to neuronal cells. We have thus explored the direct intrathecal administration of TRH in ALS, with both short-term boluses and infusions and chronic constant infusions. Our experience suggests that this approach is safe, has high patient acceptance, and is worthy of more careful evaluation.\r"

An association between ALS and impaired neuropsychological functioning is discussed through an examination of the clinical and pathologic literatures. ALS appears to be a multisystem degenerative disease with a variety of expressions that may frequently include loss of cognitive-behavioral competency with progressive involvement of the prefrontal cortex and, in a few instances, profound dementia. Finally, the article describes an analysis of trends in psychological adjustment and in the perception of physical capability over the course of a pilot clinical trial.\r"

  ".W": "The period (per) locus, which controls biological rhythms in Drosophila, was originally defined by three chemically induced mutations. Flies carrying the pero mutation were arrhythmic, whereas pers and perl mutants had circadian behavioural rhythms with 19-hour and 29-hour periodicities, respectively. Wild-type flies have 24-hour rhythms. Here we compare the per locus DNA sequences of the three mutants with the parental wild-type. The pers and perl mutations lead to amino-acid substitutions, whereas pero introduces an early translation stop (amber). The results indicate that the protein product of per controls biological rhythms. We also report that the abundance of this protein may set the pace of the Drosophila clock. Although circadian rhythms are restored when arrhythmic (per-) Drosophila are transformed with per locus DNA, flies receiving identical transforming DNA segments can produce rhythms with periods that differ by more than 12 hours. Transcription studies reveal a tenfold variation in the level of per RNA among transformed lines. Levels of per RNA are inversely correlated with period length, so that flies with lowest levels of the per product have slow-running biological clocks. On the basis of the combined studies we suggest that perl and pers mutants produce hypoactive and hyperactive per proteins, respectively.\r"

  ".U": "87172987\r", 
  ".W": "CD2 (known also as T11 (ref. 1), LFA-2 (ref. 2) and the erythrocyte rosette receptor (ref. 3] is a functionally important T lymphocyte surface glycoprotein of relative molecular mass 50,000 to 58,000 (Mr 50-58 K) which appears early in thymocyte ontogeny and is present on all mature T cells. Monoclonal antibodies to CD2 inhibit cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated killing by binding to the T lymphocyte and blocking adhesion to the target cell. Such antibodies also inhibit T helper cell responses including antigen-stimulated proliferation, interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion, and IL-2 receptor expression. Certain combinations of monoclonal antibodies to CD2 epitopes trigger proliferation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes, cytotoxic effector function and expression of IL-2 receptors by thymocytes, resulting in thymocyte proliferation in the presence of exogenous IL-2 (ref. 11). These findings suggest that CD2 can function in signalling as well as being an adhesion molecule. To understand the role of CD2 in T-cell adhesion and activation, it is essential to define its natural ligand. Our previous observation that purified CD2 inhibits rosetting of T lymphocytes with sheep erythrocytes and can be absorbed by sheep erythrocytes suggested it also might bind with detectable affinity to human cells. We now report that CD2 binds to a cell-surface antigen known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (LFA-3) with high affinity, and can mediate adhesion of lymphoid cells via interaction with LFA-3.\r"

  ".U": "87172989\r", 
  ".W": "Initial studies of somatically acquired mutations in immunoglobulin V regions from hybridomas and myelomas that are not derived from joining aberrations, suggested a controlled and specific hypermutation process, because spontaneous mutation rates observed for other genes are extremely low. Some evidence for the idea that mutations are introduced during V-gene rearrangement came from the clustering of mutations at the joining sites, from the absence of mutations in unrearranged V genes and from the low level of mutations in only partially (D-J) rearranged nonproductive heavy-chain alleles. Another model in which mutations accumulate with each cell division, rather than being introduced all at once, was supported by the finding that immunoglobulin genes of hybridomas derived from a single mouse frequently had several mutations in common, and so might be derived from the same precursor cell whose daughters then accumulated additional mutations. But the common mutations in some cases could be due to as yet unidentified related germline genes, or could represent the effect of antigen selection for certain amino acids. To try to detect hypermutation in the absence of V-gene rearrangement, we isolated B lymphocytes with endogenous heavy-chain gene mutations from transgenic mice carrying pre-rearranged kappa-transgenes. We found that these kappa-transgenes were also somatically mutated. This and other observations indicated that: ongoing rearrangement is not required for mutation; there are signals for hypermutation in the transgenes; the mutations are found only in the variable region, so the constant region may not be a target; different transgene insertion sites are compatible with hypermutations and more than one transgene is expressed in the same cell.\r"

A similar enzymatic machinery may be used to perform these highly cell-specific events in these two types of lymphoid cells. We have investigated what the signal may be that triggers the rearrangement of one or other of the receptor genes in B or T cells. Mice from three transgenic lines carrying two, four or twenty copies of the unrearranged chicken lambda light-chain locus were analysed. In all three lines the chicken Ig transgene rearranges in B cells; in the line with 20 copies, a rearranged fragment can also be detected in thymus DNA. We conclude that the inserted chicken light-chain locus in its natural configuration contains target sequences that permit specific rearrangement in mouse lymphoid B cells, but that this precise differentiation step may be deregulated in thymic cells when the physiological level of relevant information is experimentally altered.\r"

  ".W": "One surprising outcome of applying the techniques of protein engineering to the enzyme tyrosyl-transfer RNA synthetase was that the enzyme's activity could actually be increased by a specific sequence change. In particular, altering residue threonine 51 to a proline (mutant TP51) increased the enzyme's affinity for tyrosyl adenylate complexes. The non-additive effect of combining the TP51 mutation with a second sequence alteration (histidine 48 to a glycine) suggested that the effect of the TP51 change might be mediated by a structural change involving the peptide backbone. To address the question of the mechanism by which the TP51 change increases the activity of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase we have determined the structure of the mutant enzyme. We find the change has a purely local effect on the structure of the enzyme, and conclude that the increased activity of the TP51 mutant probably results from the replacement of the polar threonine residue by a non-polar group: in the wild-type enzyme substrate binding is disfavoured by the displacement of solvent from the vicinity of threonine 51. This unfavourable effect is absent in the TP51 mutant.\r"

In the absence of comparative data, the authors were forced to assume that enamel increments in fossil teeth were similar to those in modern humans. We have used evidence from the fractured surfaces of molar teeth to deduce estimates for both long- and short-period incremental growth markers within enamel in east African 'robust' australopithecine and early Homo teeth. We conclude that in these early hominids, crown formation times in posterior teeth, particularly in the large thick enamelled molar teeth of the east African 'robust' australopithecines, were shorter than those of modern humans. This evidence, considered together with data on crown and root formation times in modern apes, suggests that the posterior teeth in these hominids both formed and erupted more rapidly than those of modern man. These results have implications for attempts to assess dental and skeletal maturity in hominids.\r"

It has been proposed that such structures may function as alternative pathways of stimulation. To examine directly whether any relationship exists between Thy-1-dependent activation phenomena and T-cell activation mediated through the CD3/Ti complex, we have transfected several CD3/Ti- variants of the human T-cell line Jurkat with the murine Thy-1.2 gene. Our data indicate that in CD3/Ti-, Thy-1.2+ transfectants, monoclonal antibodies against Thy-1.2 can induce a rise in cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i), but fail to stimulate interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. The only defect in these variant cell lines responsible for the inability to produce IL-2 in response to Thy-1 stimulation was in the expression of the CD3/Ti complex, because replacement of defective Ti alpha- or beta-chain genes reconstributed both surface expression of CD3/Ti and responsiveness to Thy-1 in the IL-2 production assay.\r"

As CD8 or CD4 antibodies can also initiate negative signals in T cells in the absence of appropriate targets it is not clear whether CD8 and CD4 molecules are directly involved in the interaction of T cells with their targets. In previous experiments we have introduced the T-cell receptor alpha- and beta-chain genes from a CD8-positive cytolytic T cell specific for the antigen fluorescein (FL) and the H-2D molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) into a CD8-negative recipient cell. The CD8-positive donor cell lysed both FL-conjugated fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, which express relatively high and low amounts of H-2D molecules, respectively. In contrast the CD8-negative transfectant lysed FL-conjugated fibroblasts only. Here we show that recognition of FL-conjugated lymphoblasts by the transfectant is enhanced by supertransfecting it with the CD8 gene.\r"

  ".W": "Although much is now known of the strain variation among the type-1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), which is the cause of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in the United States, Europe, and Central Africa, much less is yet known about a second group of viruses that have been found in West Africans. One member of this group, named human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 4 (HTLV-4), has been isolated from healthy Senegalese. Another is the virus isolated from West Africans with AIDS-like illness and originally called LAV-2 but now renamed HIV-2. Both these viruses seem to be less closely related to HIV-1 than they are to a virus of healthy African green monkeys, known variously as simian T-cell lymphotropic virus type 3 (STLV-3) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which in turn is related to viruses isolated from healthy sooty mangabeys and captive macaques with a form of immunodeficiency (to distinguish these viruses they are referred to as STLV-3 (or SIV)agm, STLV-3mac, or STLV-3smm). To clarify the relationship between the various HIVs, STLV-3s and HTLV-4 we are determining and comparing the molecular and biological characteristics of several of them. Following our recent publication of a restriction-site map of STLV-3agm, we now report that the equivalent map of three isolates of HTLV-4 is remarkably similar to it. In addition we present comparative sequence data on the long terminal repeats (LTR) of HTLV-4, STLV-3agm, HIV-1 and HIV-2, together with evidence that cloned HTLV-4 uses the same receptor as HIV-1 and induces some, but not all, of the cytopathic effects attributed to most isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2.\r"

Since that first report intense research activity has been directed towards determining the mechanism of action of the active atrial natriuretic polypeptides (ANP) found in these extracts. Despite these efforts it remains controversial whether the renal actions of ANP are exerted solely on the process of glomerular filtration or involve additional direct actions on tubular transport. We have investigated the possibility that atrial natriuretic polypeptides may induce natriuresis by suppression of proximal tubular sodium and water reabsorption. Using shrinking split-drop micropuncture combined with simultaneous capillary perfusion in anaesthetized rats we report that 20 nanomolar alpha-rANP (the main component of ANP in rat plasma) added to the peritubular fluid had no direct effect on proximal fluid uptake whereas picomolar angiotensin II had a marked stimulatory action as reported. The stimulatory effect of angiotensin II on fluid reabsorption was inhibited by peritubular ANP at physiological concentrations and abolished by higher concentrations of ANP. Thus at physiological concentrations ANP acts within the kidney to decrease proximal reabsorption by inhibition of angiotensin-stimulated sodium and water transport.\r"

  ".W": "Synapsin I is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein localized to the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. This phosphoprotein is a major substrate for cyclic AMP-dependent and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Its state of phosphorylation can be altered both in vivo and in vitro by a variety of physiological and pharmacological manipulations known to affect synaptic function. Recent direct evidence suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release from the nerve terminal. In the nerve terminal, synaptic vesicles are embedded in a cytoskeletal network, consisting in part of actin. We report here the ability of the dephospho-form of synapsin I to bundle F-actin. This bundling activity is reduced when synapsin I is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and virtually abolished when it is phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or by both kinases. These results, demonstrating an interaction of synapsin I with actin in vitro, support the possibility that synapsin I is involved in clustering of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic terminal and that the phosphorylation of synapsin I may be involved in regulating the translocation of synaptic vesicles to their sites of release.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental carbon dioxide brain lesions were created over the intact dura mater of the left parietooccipital region of the anesthetized albino rabbit (40-watt impacts of 0.5-second duration, for a total of 4 seconds, with 0.5-second intervals between impacts), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies were performed with the hydrogen clearance technique. The animals were mechanically ventilated to maintain a constant PaCO2. Blood pressure, central venous pressure, electroencephalogram, and intracranial pressure were continuously monitored. The control CBF before lesion was 64.1 +/- 15.8 and 70.9 +/- 13.4 ml/100 g/minute for the left and the right hemispheres, respectively. CBF studies at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the lesion did not significantly change from the control values, save for a trend to increase over the right hemisphere only at 2 hours (range 106.0 +/- 55.4 to 41.6 +/- 9.3). It is concluded that in this model the changes in intracranial pressure and brain edema that are seen and have been previously reported are not due to change in cerebral circulation. The brain edema that results probably has characteristics similar to those seen in the cryogenic lesion (vasogenic) model, and this could account for the rise in intracranial pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic candidiasis, especially candidemia, is an increasing problem among high risk neonates. Although possible predisposing factors have been suggested, no case-control study has evaluated potential risk factors. By retrospective chart review we identified 21 infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit between 1976 and 1983 (0.9% of all admissions) who had documented nosocomial candidemia before 4 months of age. Twenty patients were matched to a control infant with similar birth weight and date of admission. We found that the median durations of exposure to the following risk factors were significantly longer in patients compared with controls: hyperalimentation; intravenous fat emulsion; endotracheal tubes; and/or tracheostomies and antibiotic therapy. However, by discriminant analysis, duration of antibiotic therapy remained the variable most strongly (and independently) associated with the development of candidemia. Treatment of the 22 episodes of candidemia was variable including catheter removal alone in 12 and a combination of catheter removal, amphotericin, 5-fluorocytosine and/or ketaconazole in the others. Although the overall mortality for the series was 5 of 20 cases (25%), no infant larger than 2000 g died. We conclude that development of candidemia in neonates is associated with, and possibly caused by, prolonged exposure to antibiotics (as documented by multivariate analysis), hyperalimentation, intravenous fat emulsion and tracheal intubation (as documented by univariate analysis). To the greatest extent possible consistent with good clinical care, exposure to these risk factors should be minimized in high risk neonates.\r"

In patients with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, classic features are usually present, but in some, particularly the elderly, the conditions present atypically. In addition, several other conditions can mimic thyroid problems, and a number of drugs can alter thyroxine levels or actual thyroid function. Laboratory measurements, including serum thyrotropin and thyroxine levels and triiodothyronine uptake, may be helpful in diagnosis. Drug therapy is indicated in most cases, and surgery is necessary in some. Thyroiditis can be of the subacute or chronic type. Aspirin, propranolol (Inderal), and occasionally glucocorticoids are used in the former. Therapy in the latter depends on results of thyroid function tests. In cases involving thyroid nodules, radioactive iodine screening and fine-needle aspiration are useful diagnostically. In patients with possible malignancy, surgery is indicated. Patients who have benign lesions are treated with thyroid hormone-suppressive therapy.\r"

Two tandem binding sites for KLP designated KI and KII have been identified by methylation interference analysis to be immediately proximal to the J kappa 1 nonamer-heptamer recognition sequences and separated by 38 base pairs from each other. Fragments of DNA containing KI and KII sites compete for binding to KLP, and both protein-DNA complexes have the same electrophoretic mobility. Other flanking sequences of immunoglobulin gene fragments do not bind to KLP. The position of KLP-DNA binding and its tissue-specific expression suggest that it may be involved in the regulation of lymphoid gene DNA rearrangements by targeting recombinase to the kappa-chain gene region.\r"

Upon treatment with 10 mM dithiothreitol, the purified receptor migrated as a single band at Mr 60,500 in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

IGFs are produced in several tissues, suggesting that they function in a paracrine or autocrine fashion as well as functioning as endocrine hormones. We studied the hormonal regulation of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA in human steroidogenic tissues. In cultured human ovarian granulosa cells, follicle-stimulating hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and dibutyryl cAMP increased IGF-II mRNA, but corticotropin [adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)], chorionic somatomammotropin, growth hormone, prolactin, dexamethasone, estradiol, and progesterone had no effect. In cultured human fetal adrenal cells, ACTH and dibutyryl cAMP increased IGF-II mRNA accumulation, but human chorionic gonadotropin and angiotensin II did not. The same five size species of IGF-II mRNA were detected in transfer blots of RNA from granulosa cells and fetal adrenal cells, and all of these increased after hormonal stimuli. Dibutyryl cAMP also increased IGF-II mRNA accumulation in cultured human placental cells. Accumulation of mRNA for the cholesterol side-chain-cleavage monooxygenase [P450scc [corrected]; cholesterol, reduced-adrenal-ferredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (side-chain-cleaving), EC 1.14.15.6] was regulated in parallel with IGF-II mRNA in all these steroidogenic tissues. IGF-I mRNA was not detected in transfer blots of these RNAs, and the minimal amounts detected in dot blots showed no detectable change after any of the hormonal stimuli studied. The data indicate that the IGF-II gene is expressed in human steroidogenic tissues and is regulated by cAMP. These data suggest that IGF-II may act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to stimulate the adrenal and gonadal growth stimulated by ACTH and gonadotropins, respectively.\r"

The phage do form plaques on recBC sbcB strains, but the palindrome is not stable--deletions that either destroy the palindrome or diminish its size overgrow the original engineered palindrome-containing phage. We have prepared stocks of lambda carrying a palindrome that is 2 X 4200 base pairs long. These phage stocks are produced by induction of a lysogen in which the two halves of the palindrome are stored at opposite ends of the prophage and are of sufficient titer (10(9) phage per ml) to enable one-step growth experiments with replication-blocked phage. We find that the large palindrome as well as a lesser palindrome of 2 X 265 base pairs are recovered intact among particles carrying unreplicated chromosomes following such an infection of a rec+ host. We propose that DNA replication drives the extrusion of palindromic sequences in vivo, forming secondary structures that are substrates for the recBC and sbcB gene products.\r"

This is now confirmed by the matching of peptide sequences from W3/25 antigen with sequence predicted from rat cDNA clones detected by cross-hybridization with a cDNA probe for human CD4. Analysis of the two sequences suggests an evolutionary origin from a structure with four immunoglobulin-related domains, although only domain 1 at the NH2 terminus meets the standard criteria for an immunoglobulin-related sequence. CD4 domains 2 and 4 contain disulfide bonds but seem like truncated immunoglobulin domains, whereas domain 3 may have a pattern of beta-strands like an immunoglobulin variable domain, but without the disulfide bond.\r"

  ".W": "A clone of the interleukin 2-producing Jurkat leukemia cell line termed JA3 (surface phenotype, T3+, Ti+, T44+, T11+, T40+) has been used to induce and select cell variants lacking surface molecules involved in T-cell activation. Following 200 rad of gamma-radiation (1 rad = 0.01 Gy), cells were treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed to T3, Ti, T44, or T11 antigen and complement. After growth of the residual cells in culture, \"negative\" cells were cloned under limiting conditions. Depending on the specificity of the mAb used for the immunoselection, three groups of variants were obtained. (i) The use of mAbs directed to T3 or Ti resulted in cell variants that expressed the T3 Ti- T44+ Leu1+ T11+ T40+ 4F2+ HLA class I+ surface phenotype. (ii) Immunoselection with anti-T44 mAb resulted in 2 variants that shared the T3- Ti- T44- Leu1- T11+ T40+ 4F2+ HLA class I+ phenotype. (iii) Cell treatment with anti-T11 mAb resulted in 15 variants characterized by the lack of T11 antigen expression and of all the other T-cell-specific surface antigens. Therefore, it appears that the different sets of JA3 cell variants, like T cells at discrete stages of intrathymic differentiation, may follow a coordinated expression of surface differentiation antigens. Analysis of the functional responsiveness of the three distinct groups of JA3 cell variants to different stimuli showed that all produced interleukin 2 in response to A23187 calcium ionophore plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The first group of variants (T3- Ti-) did not respond to stimulation with anti-T3, anti-Ti, or anti-T44 mAbs. Eight of 9 did not respond to phytohemagglutinin either; however, all responded to appropriate stimulatory combinations of anti-T11 mAbs (and to calcium ionophore). The second group of variants (T3-, Ti-, T44-, T11+), similar to the first group, did not respond to anti-T3, anti-Ti, anti-T44 mAbs, and phytohemagglutinin, but they were fully responsive to anti-T11 mAb. The last group of variants (lacking all the T-cell-specific surface antigens) only responded to calcium ionophore A23187.\r"

To evaluate the extent of crossreactivity between these M. tuberculosis antigens and antigens of Mycobacterium leprae, recombinant antigens were probed with monoclonal antibodies directed against the protein antigens of these bacilli. One of the antigens, a 65-kDa protein, has determinants common to M. tuberculosis and M. leprae. We find not only that this antigen is recognized by mouse monoclonal antibodies but that it is the major protein recognized by anti-M. tuberculosis rabbit sera. The 65-kDa proteins of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae appear to play a role in the humoral and cell-mediated immune response to these pathogens.\r"

In these tissue culture cells (and presumably also in the renal inner medulla), the intracellular sorbitol helps balance the osmotic pressure of elevated extracellular NaCl and thus prevents cellular dehydration.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence is presented that a sporulation-essential sigma factor of Bacillus subtilis, sigma 29, is synthesized as an inactive precursor (P31) and that its activation occurs by a developmentally regulated cleavage of 29 amino acids from the P31 amino terminus. A pulse-chase experiment demonstrated that sigma 29 was derived from a preexisting protein, with appearance of radioactively labeled sigma 29 paralleling the disappearance of labeled P31. The disappearance of pulse-labeled P31 did not occur when the experiment was done with a B. subtilis strain carrying a mutation in a locus (spoIIE) required for sigma 29, but not P31, synthesis. Microsequencing of sigma 29 protein revealed that its amino terminus originates at amino acid 30 of the P31 amino acid sequence. In order to test whether a proteolytic event alone could activate P31 to a protein with sigma 29-like properties, a fusion protein (P31*) containing most of P31 was overproduced in Escherichia coli and converted in vitro into a protein with the electrophoretic mobility of sigma 29 by limited treatment with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. Protease-treated P31*, but not untreated P31*, was capable of directing B. subtilis core RNA polymerase to specifically initiate RNA synthesis at a sigma 29-recognized promoter in vitro.\r"

Employing these features we have screened the protein sequence data base of the Protein Identification Resource and have identified only known GTP-binding proteins with the exception of protein 2C from foot-and-mouth disease virus as matching the consensus sequence. Based on this finding we predict that foot-and-mouth disease virus protein 2C binds GTP and, by analogy, that protein 2C from several related viruses (polio, rhino, encephalomyocarditis, and cowpea mosaic) will bind a nucleotide as part of its biologic activity.\r"

That is, organisms should complete their entire reproductive effort in a short period of time following maturation. Direct empirical verification of this idea has been lacking. Six independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster were maintained in two different environments, called r and K, for more than 120 generations. In the r environment population size was small, larval survival and rates of population growth were high, and reproduction was limited to a few days after eclosion. In the K environment population size was large and larval survival low, but adults were allowed to reproduce indefinitely. The fecundity of females of different sizes from each environment was measured daily for 4 weeks. No differences in fecundity were seen during the first week of adult life for females from the two environments. By the fourth week, however, the fecundity of large females from the r environment was 47-83% less than that of females from the K environment. The accelerated senescence exhibited by females from the r environment appears to be due to the accumulation of deleterious alleles whose effects are expressed late in life, which is consistent with the mutation accumulation hypothesis for the evolution of senescence.\r"

  ".U": "87175601\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors on activated T cells exist in high- and low-affinity configurations, both of which share a ligand-binding component known as the Tac protein. Although almost all binding of IL-2 to such cells was inhibited by an antibody to Tac, the predominant component of binding on the natural killer (NK)-like cell line YT was resistant to this reagent. The ligand-binding component on YT cells also differed from Tac in its affinity constant (Kd approximately 8.2 X 10(-10) M vs. Kd approximately equal to 1.1 X 10(-8) M for low-affinity Tac sites) and in its susceptibility to inhibition by certain antibodies to IL-2. When the YT cells were stimulated in a manner that induced expression of the Tac protein, the IL-2 binding sites were converted to a high-affinity configuration (Kd approximately 1.8 X 10(-11) M). Thus, the original binding component on unstimulated YT cells appeared to combine with Tac and IL-2 to produce a high-affinity receptor complex. Use of bifunctional crosslinking agents following ligand binding to unstimulated YT cells yielded covalent IL-2-receptor complexes of 83 and 90 kDa. These complexes were similar in size to those derived from high-affinity receptors on activated T cells and shared a similar fragmentation pattern upon proteolysis. These results demonstrate the existence of a second IL-2 binding component in addition to the Tac protein and suggest that this component combines with Tac and IL-2 to form high-affinity receptor sites.\r"

Papillomas were induced in SENCAR mice by two-stage carcinogenesis (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). Individual tumors were randomly sampled at different times during promotion, and histopathologic and cytogenetic studies were carried out on every tumor. Early during promotion (10 weeks), most papillomas were well-differentiated hyperplastic lesions with mild or no cellular atypia. No tumors showed severe dysplastic changes. By 20 weeks of promotion, a dramatic drop had occurred in the number of lesions with no dysplasia. Most of the tumors presented moderate dysplasia, and some already showed severe dysplastic changes. At later stages (30-40 weeks), most of the papillomas were classified as moderately or severely dysplastic papillomas, and several were considered to be intrapapillomatous carcinomas. This histopathologic evaluation was supported by nuclear measurements performed on papillomas at different time points. Chromosomal abnormalities followed a similar trend. Papillomas seem to start as diploid lesions, but between 10 and 20 weeks of promotion, hyperdiploid cells can be observed in almost every tumor. In some cases the stem line was taken over by aneuploid clones. At 40 weeks of promotion, all papillomas were aneuploid, most of them with hyperdiploid stem lines. A positive correlation was found between the histological and cytogenetic studies, with the most aggressive and atypical tumors being the more aneuploid. These results support the idea that most, if not all, papillomas are truly premalignant lesions in different stages of the potential progression toward malignancy. Chromosomal abnormalities might play an important role in the sequence of events leading to malignancy.\r"

Studies of specific receptors (neurotransmitters or hormones) located on this structure can be performed by means of radioligand-binding techniques on isolated brain microvessels. We examined on pure bovine cerebral microvessel preparations the binding of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), using 125I-labeled ANF. Saturation and competition experiments demonstrated the presence of a single class of ANF-binding sites with high affinity (dissociation constant, approximately 10(-10) M) and with a binding capacity of 58 fmol/mg of protein. The binding of 125I-labeled ANF to brain microvessels is specific, reversible, and time dependent, as is shown by association-dissociation experiments. The demonstration of specific ANF-binding sites on brain microvessels supposes a physiological role of ANF on brain microvasculature. The coexistence of ANF and angiotensin II receptors on this cerebrovascular tissue suggests that the two circulating peptides may act as mutual antagonists in the regulation of brain microcirculation and/or blood-brain barrier function.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of voltage-activated Ca2+ current by acetylcholine was studied in single freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells from the stomach of the toad Bufo marinus by using the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. Ca2+ currents were elicited by positive-going command pulses from a holding level near -80 mV in the presence of internal Cs+ to block outward K+ currents. Ca2+ current was greatest in magnitude at command potentials near 10 mV. At such command potentials, acetylcholine increased the magnitude of the inward current and slowed its decay. The effects of acetylcholine were seen in the absence of external Na+ or with low Cl- (aspartate replacement) in the bathing solution and could be mimicked by muscarine. The peak of the current-voltage relationship for the Ca2+ current was not discernibly shifted along the voltage axis by acetylcholine. These results demonstrate that activation of muscarinic receptors not only suppresses a K+ current (M-current), as we have previously demonstrated [Sims, S. M., Singer, J. J. & Walsh, J. V., Jr. (1985) J. Physiol. (London) 367, 503-529], but also increases the magnitude and slows the decay of Ca2+ current.\r"

We have constructed a chimeric cDNA molecule containing the extracellular IL-2-binding domain of the IL-2 receptor cDNA and the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of the EGF receptor cDNA. When transfected into fibroblasts, this IL-2-EGF receptor cDNA generated high-affinity receptors for IL-2. Moreover, fibroblasts transfected with the chimeric molecule were morphologically transformed and produced rapidly growing tumors in nude mice.\r"

The gene, tentatively designated as GPA1, contains a contiguous, single open reading frame of 1416 nucleotides that codes for a protein of 472 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 54,075. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the GPA1 gene (tentatively designated as G protein 1 alpha or GP1 alpha) is remarkably homologous to the amino acid sequence of rat brain Gi alpha and the alpha subunit of the G protein of unknown function (Go alpha); the primary structure of the sites for GTP hydrolysis as well as GTP interaction are nearly identical. The main difference in the molecular sizes of yeast GP1 alpha (472 amino acids) and rat brain Gi alpha (355 amino acids) is due to the presence of a stretch of 110 extra amino acid residues in yeast GP1 alpha, which are inserted near the NH2-terminal one-third of mammalian Gi alpha. From blot-hybridization analysis, the size of the GP1 alpha mRNA was estimated as 1.7 kilobases.\r"

In view of the recent observation that pT181 initiates replication by a nick and 3'-extension mechanism (S.

The hypothalamic transcripts are similar in overall size (approximately 1100 nucleotides), 5' terminus, 3' terminus, and nucleotide sequence to their counterparts synthesized in the cardiac atria. The 5' terminus of the hypothalamic transcripts, determined by both S1 nuclease and primer-extension analysis, was located approximately 20 nucleotides downstream from the TATAAAA sequence that is thought to dictate the start of transcription. Similar 5' termini were identified in RNA from the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The 3' termini of the hypothalamic transcripts mapped approximately 10 nucleotides downstream from each of two successive AATAAA sequences that are believed to provide the cleavage signal required for subsequent polyadenylylation. The same 3' termini were present in atrial, ventricular, lung, and pituitary RNA. To confirm the identity of the hypothalamic gene transcript, a partial-length cDNA clone encoding ANF was isolated from a hypothalamic cDNA library and sequenced. This hypothalamic clone was identical to an analogous atrial cDNA clone at each of its 612 nucleotide positions. These findings suggest that ANF peptides, previously identified in specific loci of the hypothalamus and pontine tegmentum, are synthesized locally in these tissues and support a role for this peptide in the central regulation of cardiovascular physiology.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that magnification, an increase in the number of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) in gametes produced by rDNA-deficient flies, can occur in female Drosophila if they have a Y chromosome. We now have tested several X-Y translocation and recombinant chromosomes to determine which parts of the Y chromosome are necessary for magnification to occur in females. Our data indicate that the required region is the distal part of the long arm of the Y chromosome, YL. We have also used X-Y translocation chromosomes to study magnification of rDNA-deficient X chromosomes in males. Our data show that the region of the Y chromosome from the distal end of the nucleolus organizer through the centromere is not required for magnification in males. The frequency of magnification in males with rDNA-deficient Y fragments is comparable to that produced by Ybb-, a chromosome that has often been used to produce magnification in males. These results demonstrate that the Ybb-chromosome is not uniquely effective in causing magnification to occur in males. The results of these studies imply that sequences present on YL are required for magnification to occur in females; these sequences are probably also required for magnification in males. Since unequal sister chromatid exchange has been implicated as the major mechanism of ribosomal gene increase during magnification, the YL sequences required for magnification may be involved in encoding or regulating products needed for sister chromatid recombination in germ-line cells.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanism of the t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation found in follicular lymphoma, we examined the structure of both derivative (der) chromosomal breakpoints as well as their germ-line predecessors. We noted that chromosome segment 18q21 was juxtaposed with immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain gene diversity (DH) regions on all five der(18) chromosomes we examined, and we confirmed the juncture with immunoglobulin H-chain gene joining (JH) regions on the der(14) chromosome. However, the t(14;18) was not fully reciprocal in that chromosome 14 DNA between the DH and JH regions was deleted. Furthermore, extra nucleotides, reminiscent of \"N\" segments, were present at the der(14) and possibly der(18) junctions. This indicates that despite the mature B-cell phenotype of follicular lymphoma, the t(14;18) occurs during attempted DH-JH joining, the earliest event in immunoglobulin rearrangement in a pre-B-cell. Our detailed analysis of the germ-line 18q21 region indicated that most breakpoints clustered within a 150-base-pair major breakpoint region. However, we found no evidence for evolutionarily conserved immunoglobulin-like recombinational signals at 18q21, arguing against a role for immunoglobulin recombinase in chromosome 18 breakage. Instead, a direct repeat duplication of chromosome 18 sequences was discovered at both chromosomal junctures, typical of the repair of a naturally occurring staggered double-stranded DNA break. These results prompt a translocation model with illegitimate pairing of a staggered double-stranded DNA break at 18q21 and an immunoglobulin endonuclease-mediated break at 14q32 and with N-segment addition, repair, and ligation to generate der(14) and der(18) chromosomes.\r"

In this study, full-length cDNA clones encoding the I-A alpha and beta chains from the nonobese diabetic mouse have been isolated and sequenced. They are identical to the sequences previously determined from the H-2d haplotype except for the sequence encoding the first external domain, the leader peptide, and the 5' untranslated region of the I-A beta chain molecule. Most strikingly, there are five consecutive nucleotide substitutions which lead to two radical amino acid changes in a region that is conserved between human and mouse. We suggest that the unique structure of the first external I-A beta chain domain is a major determinant in the disease susceptibility that maps to the major histocompatibility complex of the nonobese diabetic mouse.\r"

To determine whether the adult B-cell repertoire is similarly skewed, we first identified the genes that rearrange in pre-B cells from BALB/c mice and then determined their frequency of rearrangement in adult B cells. In fetal pre-B cell lines, two genes, VH81X from the 7183 subfamily and VHOx2 from the Q52 subfamily, comprise 75% of the rearranged alleles of an estimated 1000 genes (P less than 0.001). Sequencing analyses revealed that rearrangements involving the two genes were both productive and nonproductive. The biased rearrangement of these two VH genes persists in B-cell hybridomas from adult mice at a frequency of 22%, as determined by Southern gel analysis and RNA sequencing. The sequence of one VHOx2 rearrangement from a hybridoma shows that the rearrangement is productive, suggesting that the gene encodes an antibody that could participate in the immune response. The data indicate that the adult B-cell repertoire is not random concerning usage of individual VH genes, and it may be shaped by the unknown mechanisms that cause preferential rearrangement of certain genes early in ontogeny.\r"

  ".W": "The recent slowdown in the decline of infant mortality in the United States and the continued high risk of death among black infants (twice that of white infants) prompted a consortium of Public Health Service agencies to collaborate with all States in the development of a national data base from linked birth and infant death certificates. This National Infant Mortality Surveillance (NIMS) project for the 1980 U.S. birth cohort provides neonatal, postneonatal, and infant mortality risks for blacks, whites, and all races in 12 categories of birth weights. (Note: Neonatal mortality risk = number of deaths to infants less than 28 days of life per 1,000 live births; postneonatal mortality risk = number of deaths to infants 28 days to less than 1 year of life per 1,000 neonatal survivors; and infant mortality risk = number of deaths to infants less than 1 year of life per 1,000 live births.) Separate tabulations were requested for infants born in single and multiple deliveries. For single-delivery births, tabulations included birth weight, age at death, race of infant, and each of these characteristics: infant's live-birth order, sex, gestation, type of delivery, and cause of death; and mother's age, education, prenatal care history, and number of prior fetal losses at 20 weeks' or more gestation. An estimated 95 percent of eligible deaths were included in the NIMS tabulations. The analyses focus on three components of infant mortality: birth weight distribution of live births, neonatal mortality, and postneonatal mortality. The most important predictor for infant survival was birth weight, with an exponential improvement in survival by increasing birth weight to its optimum level. The nearly twofold higher risk of infant mortality among blacks was related to a higher prevalence of low birth weights and to higher mortality risks in the neonatal period for infants weighing 3,000 grams or more, and in the postneonatal period for all infants, regardless of birth weight. Regardless of other infant or maternal risk factors, the black-white gap persisted for infants weighing 2,500 grams or more.\r"

The infant mortality risk (IMR) for the nation was 11.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. The risk (with 95 percent confidence intervals [CI]) for the four U.S. Census regions were West 9.9 (9.7 to 10.1), Northeast 10.4 (10.1 to 10.6), North Central 10.8 (10.6 to 11.0), and South 12.1 (11.9 to 12.3). In all regions, the IMR for blacks was approximately twice that of whites. Seventy-two percent of the higher IMR in the South was due to a higher proportion of black births compared with the remainder of the nation, reflecting the higher mortality rates suffered by black infants, and 28 percent to higher mortality among southern whites. The IMR for whites in the South was significantly higher than in the remainder of the nation: 9.8 versus 9.1 (relative risk = 1.09, CI = 1.06 to 1.11). Thirty-six percent of this excess in IMR was due to a higher frequency of low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams), 18 percent was due to higher IMR in infants with birth weight less than 2,500 grams, and 46 percent due to higher IMR in infants with birth weights of 2,500 g or more. Black infants born in the West had a lower risk of death than black infants in the other regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mortality risk ratios of two or greater were found when comparing high and low States for overall black infant mortality risks, overall neonatal mortality, neonatal mortality risks for black and white infants examined separately, neonatal mortality risks for low birth weight infants regardless of race, and overall postneonatal mortality and postneonatal mortality for white infants. The lowest State-specific black mortality risks were higher than the highest white risks for overall infant mortality and neonatal mortality. The differences between State extremes in mortality risks are greater than the differences between the United States and the Scandinavian countries with the lowest infant mortality.\r"

(Infant mortality risk is the number of deaths of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births.) In this 20-year period, the infant mortality risk (IMR) for single-delivery infants declined 53 percent, from 23.3 deaths per 1,000 live births to 11.0; 91 percent of this decline was due to lower IMRs within birth weight categories, and 9 percent was due to reduced frequency of low birth weight. The greatest reduction in neonatal mortality (under 28 days)--73 percent--occurred among infants of 1,500-1,999 grams (g) birth weight, whereas the greatest reductions in postneonatal mortality (28 days to under 1 year)--51 percent to 54 percent--occurred among infants of 3,500 g or more birth weight. Trends in IMR for black and white infants were similar, and the twofold gap between the races in IMR persisted from 1960 to 1980. For whites, reductions in the frequency of low birth weights contributed to the decline in the IMR. For blacks, the percentage of infants with birth weights of less than 1,500 g increased, and the total reduction in the IMR was attributable to lower birth weight-specific mortality risks. In some regions of the United States, failure to observe an increase in birth weight for blacks may be a reporting artifact, reflecting improved reporting of births of very small black infants in 1980. Examination of changes in perinatal mortality risks (from 20 weeks gestation to less than 28 days of life) did not suggest that infant mortality trends were substantially affected by changes in the distinction between fetal and neonatal deaths over the 20-year period. Reducing the number of low birth weight infants remains the greatest potential for future reductions in infant mortality.\r"

Compared with heavier infants, infants with birth weights of 500-2,499 grams (g) are at increased risk of both neonatal and postneonatal death for virtually all causes. Sixty-two percent of neonatal deaths (under 28 days of life) were attributed to \"conditions arising in the perinatal period,\" as defined using codes from the International Classification of Diseases. Prematurity-low birth weight and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were the leading causes of such deaths among infants with birth weights of 500-2,499 g, while birth trauma-hypoxia-asphyxia and other perinatal respiratory conditions were the leading causes among heavier infants. For all birth weight groups, congenital anomalies were the second leading cause, representing 27 percent of neonatal deaths. Although perinatal conditions caused nearly one-third of postneonatal deaths (28 days to under 1 year of life) among infants with birth weights of 500-1,499 g, for the other birth weight groups these conditions were much less important; predominant causes of postneonatal death were sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), congenital anomalies, infections, and injuries. Black infants had a roughly twofold higher risk of neonatal and postneonatal death than did white infants for all causes except congenital anomalies, which occurred with almost equal frequency in blacks and whites. However, for infants with birth weights of 500-2,499 g, blacks had lower risks of neonatal death from RDS and congenital anomalies. Between 1960 (the latest year for which national birth weight-specific mortality statistics had been available) and 1980, SIDS emerged as a major diagnostic rubric. Otherwise, except for infections and congenital anomalies among infants with birth weights of 500-1,499 g, all causes of death declined in frequency among all birth weight groups.\r"

In 1960 there were 14,714 deaths due to congenital anomalies, compared with 8,674 in 1980, a 41 percent reduction. The infant mortality risk (IMR) due to congenital anomalies fell 31 percent. This is in contrast with the observed 54 percent decline in IMR due to all causes. This reduction in mortality due to congenital anomalies occurred for both whites and blacks in the postneonatal period and for whites only in the neonatal period. Changes ranged from a 1.8 percent increase for the black neonatal mortality risk to a 46.6 percent decrease for the white postneonatal mortality risk. In spite of these relative reductions, the absolute percentage of all infant deaths due to congenital anomalies had increased from 15.8 percent in 1960 to 24.1 percent in 1980. Two categories, cardiovascular and central nervous system anomalies, accounted for 72 percent of infant deaths due to congenital anomalies in 1960 and for 59 percent in 1980; cardiovascular anomalies accounted for 48 percent of all deaths due to congenital anomalies in 1960 and 40 percent in 1980. Infant mortality risks in the United States showed a 2:1 black to white ratio in both 1960 and 1980. However, for infant mortality due to congenital anomalies, the black and white mortality risks were approximately equal in both 1960 and 1980. For infants with birth weights of 500-2,499 g, the risk of neonatal mortality for blacks was less than half the risk for whites.\r"

  ".W": "In recent decades, neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates have declined overall in the United States. Yet, the mortality rates for black infants continue to be approximately twice those for white infants. With the use of data from 45 of the 53 vital statistics reporting areas that participated in the 1980 National Infant Mortality Surveillance project, we extended previous State analyses to describe differences, nationally, in neonatal and postneonatal mortality risks for black and white infants according to gestational age and birth weight. After restricting our analysis to single-delivery infants with known and plausible combinations of gestational age of 26 or more weeks and birth weights of 500 grams (g) or more, the neonatal mortality risk (NMR)--that is, the number of deaths to infants less than 28 days of life per 1,000 live births--for black infants was 1.6 times higher than the NMR for whites. This difference was largely explained by two findings: First, although the NMR was lower for black than for white infants with gestational ages of less than 38 weeks and birth weights less than 3,000 g, that advantage was heavily outweighed by the higher percentage of such births among blacks, accounting for roughly two-thirds of the overall difference in NMR between blacks and whites. Second, most of the remaining difference in NMR was accounted for by higher NMRs among black infants with gestational ages of 38 or more weeks and birth weights of 3,000 g or more. A comparison of the lowest mortality risk for any combination of birth weight and gestational age showed that the black NMR was 1.89 times higher than the white NMR. The postneonatal mortality risk (PNMR)--PNMR equals the number of deaths to infants 28 days to less than 1 year of life per 1,000 neonatal survivors--for black infants was 2.09 times the PNMR for white infants. Black infants had higher PNMRs than white infants for nearly all combinations of birth weight and gestational age. Higher PNMRs among infants with gestational ages of 38 or more weeks and birth weights of 2,500 g or more accounted for 43 percent of the difference in PNMR between black infants and white infants. Eliminating the U.S. black-white infant mortality disparity will require not only reducing the higher frequency of prematurity and low birth weight among black infants, but also improving the survival during both the neonatal and postneonatal periods of term black infants with normal birth weights.\r"

  ".W": "In 1980, there were 562,330 babies born in the United States to teenage mothers (19 years of age or younger). The offspring of teenage mothers have long been known to be at increased risk of infant mortality, largely because of their high prevalence of low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams). We used data from the National Infant Mortality Surveillance (NIMS) project to examine the effect of young maternal age and low birth weight on infant mortality among infants born in 1980 to U.S. residents. This analysis was restricted to single-delivery babies who were either black or white, who were born to mothers ages 10-29 years, and who were born in one of 48 States or the District of Columbia. Included were 2,527,813 births and 28,499 deaths (data from Maine and Texas were excluded for technical reasons). Direct standardization was used to calculate the relative risks, adjusted for birth weight, of neonatal mortality (less than 28 days of life) and postneonatal mortality (28 days to less than 1 year of life) by race and maternal age. There was a strong association between young maternal age and high infant mortality and between young maternal age and a high prevalence of low birth weight. Neonatal mortality declined steadily with increasing maternal age. After adjusting for birth weight, the race-specific relative risks for babies born to mothers less than 16 years of age were still elevated from 11 to 40 percent, compared with babies born to mothers 25-29 years of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Record linkage depends on complete registration of vital events, interstate exchange of vital records, accurate information on certificates, and a comprehensive linkage system. States reported 2,604 unlinked infant death certificates for 1980, ranging from 0 to 397 per State. Age at death for these infants ranged from 1 minute to 11 months. More than 41 percent of the unlinked death certificates were for postneonates, compared with 32.5 percent found in the cohort's total infant death experience. Only 38.2 percent of the unlinked infant death certificates showed strictly intrastate events (birth and death occurrence, and residence at death all in one State), compared with 92.9 percent in the cohort's total infant death experience. Estimates of the percentage successfully linked by State ranged from 86.0 to 100.0. After adjusting for the certainly unlinked infant death certificates, nine States' infant mortality risks increased by more than 0.2 per 1,000 live births. Improvements are needed both within and between States to ensure more complete birth and infant death certificate linkage.\r"

Therefore, it was essential to achieve maximum uniformity among the separate data sets and to specify when this uniformity could not be obtained. In working with these multiple sources, we identified five key issues that relate to data from linked birth and death certificates: Variations in definitions of variables are often embedded in data that have been gathered from several independent sources. (For NIMS, the sources were 53 reporting areas and the National Center for Health Statistics.) Variations in States' linking procedures--these are based on an individual State's primary purpose for linking the data--affect the completeness and comparability of the 1980 resident birth cohorts used for NIMS. Variations in the recording of some pregnancy outcomes as fetal deaths or live births are known to be a problem in vital statistics data that particularly affects data for events among infants weighing less than 500 g at birth. Ambiguities occur frequently in unknowns or zero values. For NIMS this effect was most pronounced for the pregnancy history variables. Examination of the values reported for unknown or zero categories helps in uncovering problems with and improving quality of data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Combining information from different sources can be valuable in identifying problems--the essential first step in program planning. To facilitate this process, a workshop was conducted during the National Infant Mortality Surveillance Conference in Atlanta, GA. Maternal and child health directors explored the use of linked birth and infant death data for program planning and evaluation. Linked birth and infant death certificate files permit evaluation of infant mortality by birth weight and other infant and maternal characteristics, thus providing more detailed information than birth or death certificates alone. An assessment of the birth weight distribution of live births, birth weight specific-mortality risks, distribution of deaths by birth weight, and birth weight-specific causes of death can help identify problems in the childbearing population and with the delivery of health services. Once the infant health problems are defined clearly, the selection and delivery of services can be better targeted and evaluated for the reduction of these problems.\r"

A linked file of the 1982 birth cohort was produced that successfully linked 97 percent of the death records for infants who died in a nine-State area. The method NCHS uses to create national linked files takes full advantage of two existing data sources: the NCHS fully coded natality and mortality files and State files of matched births and infant deaths. For the nine-State pilot area, NCHS obtained computerized linked files from the States and extracted from them the certificate numbers on matching birth and death records. With the use of these numbers, NCHS selected and linked birth and death statistical records from its final natality and mortality files, thus creating new statistical linked records. The initial match rate of 93.2 percent for the project's linked record file was increased to 96.7 percent as a result of efforts by the pilot States to complete the matching of birth and infant death records. Matching in the nine-State linked file appears to be highly accurate, based on the results of two evaluation studies. In the second stage of the project, now underway, NCHS will continue to evaluate and improve State and national linked files for the four birth cohorts of 1983-86. With funding from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, stage 2 will be conducted in collaboration with each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and New York City, an independent registration area.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 25 percent of persons diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been black. This paper examines three areas of concern when focusing on AIDS in the black population: differences from whites in patterns of transmission of the infection, cultural factors that may affect health education efforts, and ethnically relevant issues in the provision of medical care to black persons with AIDS. Recognition of these differences is important in developing appropriate AIDS-related services for the black population. First, the epidemiologic pattern of infection in the black population differs from whites. Although they represent only 12 percent of the American population, blacks make up nearly one-quarter of reported AIDS cases. Currently, it is estimated that between 1 and 1.4 percent of the black population may be infected with the human T-lymphotropic virus/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV), a rate estimated to be three times that of whites. In addition, epidemiologic patterns of viral transmission in the black community suggest a greater incursion into the heterosexual population. Second, educational interventions designed to slow the rate of infection need to be sensitive to cultural and behavioral differences between blacks and whites who are at increased risk for acquiring or transmitting an HTLV-III/LAV infection. These include possible differences in perceptions of being at risk and actual risk behaviors. Third, in caring for black AIDS patients there are psychological, sociocultural, and medical care issues that are relevant. Research findings specific to health care for blacks are reviewed with particular reference to concerns that might arise in the treatment of black persons with AIDS. Recommendations for research and health education efforts in the black community are presented.\r"

Mean and percentile values are presented in tabular form. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volumes were lower than those reported in surveys of white populations. Beginning with the 11-15-year age groups, black males had higher red cell values than black females. After age 30, mean hemoglobin levels for men gradually declined, while those in women rose, so that the sex difference diminished after 60 years of age. Leukocyte counts were higher in young children and in women, compared with men ages 21-50 years. After 60 years of age, the sex difference disappeared. Further large surveys that exclude data on persons with iron deficiency are needed in black populations.\r"

In this process, the sevenless gene is essential for the development of a single type of photoreceptor cell. In the absence of proper sevenless function the cells that would normally become the R7 photoreceptors instead become nonneuronal cells. Previous morphological and genetic analysis has indicated that the product of the sevenless gene is involved in reading or interpreting the positional information that specifies this particular developmental pathway. The sevenless gene has now been isolated and characterized. The data indicate that sevenless encodes a transmembrane protein with a tyrosine kinase domain. This structural similarity between sevenless and certain hormone receptors suggests that similar mechanisms are involved in developmental decisions based on cell-cell interaction and physiological or developmental changes induced by diffusible factors.\r"

When purified Leu-1+ and Leu-1- B lymphocytes were transformed into immunoglobulin-secreting cells by infection with Epstein-Barr virus and the culture fluids were tested for reactivity with self-antigens, at least two important autoantibodies, antibody to the Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin G (rheumatoid factor) and antibody to single-stranded DNA, were found to be made exclusively by Leu-1+ B cells. It is concluded that the Leu-1+ lymphocytes represent a major subset of the normal human B cell repertoire and include the B cells capable of making autoantibodies similar to those found in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

The neonatal enrichment of Leu-1+ B cells, the presence of Leu-1+ B cells in increased frequencies in patients with autoimmune disease, and the involvement of Leu-1+ B cells in autoantibody secretion suggest both developmental and functional homologies between this human B cell subpopulation and the murine Ly-1 B cell subpopulation.\r"

The effects of aluminum ion on the in vitro assembly of tubulin into microtubules has been examined by determining the association constants for the metal ion-guanosine triphosphate-tubulin ternary complex required for polymerization. The association constant for aluminum ion was approximately 10(7) times that of magnesium ion, the physiological mediator of microtubule assembly. In addition, aluminum ion at 4.0 X 10(-10) mole per liter competed effectively with magnesium ion for support of tubulin polymerization when magnesium ion falls below 1.0 millimole per liter. The microtubules produced by aluminum ion were indistinguishable from those produced by magnesium ion when viewed by electron microscopy, and they showed identical critical tubulin concentrations for assembly and sensitivities to cold-induced depolymerization. However, the rate of guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis and the sensitivity to calcium ion-induced depolymerization, critical regulatory processes of microtubules in vivo, were markedly lower for aluminum ion microtubules than for magnesium ion microtubules.\r"

Specific loss of alleles from chromosome 22 was detected with polymorphic DNA markers in two acoustic neuromas, two neurofibromas, and one meningioma from BANF patients. This indicates a common pathogenetic mechanism for all three tumor types. The two neurofibromas were among three taken from the same patient, and both showed loss of identical alleles demonstrating that the same chromosome suffered deletion in both tumors. The third neurofibroma from this patient showed no detectable loss of heterozygosity, which suggests the possibility of a more subtle mutational event that affects chromosome 22. In the two acoustic neuromas, only a portion of chromosome 22 was deleted, narrowing the possible chromosomal location of the gene that causes BANF to the region distal to the D22S9 locus in band 22q11. The identification of progressively smaller deletions on chromosome 22 in these tumor types may well provide a means to clone and characterize the defect.\r"

Since short lengths of DNA are not that flexible, it may be that runs of coherently spaced deoxyadenylate residues constitute bend sites in the ori sequence that facilitate the process. Earlier data showed that ori DNA has electrophoretic anomalies characteristic of bend sites and that these are augmented by initiator protein binding. Here origin bending is examined by direct measurement of the ability of polymerized ori sequences to form small circles. The smallest circles observed (84 residues) are compatible with the required radius of curvature. Bend sites within the O protein binding sites, bend sites in the spacers between them, plus the inherent flexibility of non-bent DNA in the origin may all contribute to origin bending. The data also show that a bend site is required for O protein binding to DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Cold hemagglutinin disease is infrequently recognized before complications ensue. We describe a patient with chronic cold hemagglutinin disease who sustained an acute hemolytic crisis during a routine operative procedure in a cool operating room. Cold agglutinins were present during routine preoperative blood cross matching with the Coombs' test positive for C3d. Analysis of the offending cold agglutinin revealed a high-titer monoclonal IgM-kappa antibody with anti-I specificity and broad thermal amplitude. Major complications from the presence of cold agglutinins have been poorly documented and are often thought to be of only theoretic concern. This case and literature review show that such complications may occur and emphasize the importance of careful preoperative plans when the Coombs' test suggests that cold agglutinins exist.\r"

  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone originating from atrial cardiocytes. It seems to be involved in the regulatory control of circulating volume and vascular tone. Plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IrANP) was investigated in 22 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (16 with atrial fibrillation, 4 with atrial flutter, one with a Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) and one with atrial tachycardia). During the aute attack, IrANP was significantly increased (125.3 +/- 11.4 pmol/l) compared to samples obtained during convalescence (55.9 +/- 4.7 pmol/l). Heart rate (HR) was 144 +/- 4.3 beats/min during the arrhythmia and 75 +/- 2.6 during convalescence. The reduction of IrANP in plasma from the acute attack of tachycardia to follow-up was significantly related to the reduction of HR (p less than 0.05). Irrespective of type of paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, 50% of the patients experienced polyuria during the attack. This symptom was more frequent in younger patients with a shorter duration of tachycardia. Polyuria patients had a higher HR during the attack of supraventricular tachycardia. Even though polyuria was not always found in the patients with the highest IrANP values, the symptom was associated with significantly higher concentrations of IrANP in plasma compared to the non-polyuria group. We conclude that IrANP is increased in plasma during acute attacks of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Furthermore, the polyuria frequently associated with this condition may partly be due to excess release of ANP from cardiac myocytes.\r"

To study the scintigraphic appearance of fresh pericardial blood, we performed equilibrium RNV in six dogs with measured volumes (10, 30, or 50 ml) of intrapericardial blood. Loculated and diffuse pericardial blood was simulated by injecting the blood either into an intrapericardial balloon, or freely into the pericardial space. Ability to detect pericardial blood was determined by blinded review, and blood volume analysis was attempted by measuring its scintigraphic thickness, brightness (relative to the left ventricle), extent, and background-subtracted count rate and a peak count index. Detection rates for 10, 30, and 50 ml were all 100% for loculated pericardial blood, and 67%, 100% and 100% for free pericardial blood, with the use of three scintigraphic views. Visually determined \"extent\" of the abnormal blood pool was the most reliable indicator of pericardial blood volume. When the volume was 30 ml or more, at least 40% of the heart was surrounded in 26 of 27 cases (96%); the specificity of this finding was 90%. We conclude from this animal study that RNV should be a sensitive method for detecting pericardial bleeding; visual appearance permits qualitative assessment of the volume of accumulated labeled blood.\r"

Stepwise regression techniques were used to develop models relating feeding-associated factors. Feeding method significantly affected weight gain in infants 1000 to 1249 g birth weight with continuous nasogastric feeding associated with an additional weight gain of 3.6 to 6.1 g/kg/d. No effects of feeding method on changes in occipitofrontal circumference, triceps skin-fold thickness, bilirubin values, or total protein values were demonstrable. There were few major differences between feeding groups on measures of feeding complications. Continuous nasogastric feeding was fairly well tolerated and resulted in improved weight gain when compared with intermittent nasogastric feeding in preterm infants 1000 to 1249 g birth weight.\r"

Preexposure prophylaxis for type B hepatitis is indicated for health care workers who have frequent contact with blood, and most endoscopists would be among this group of high-risk individuals. Prenatal screening of pregnant women for HBsAg provides an opportunity to intervene in the vicious cycle of perpetuating a population of hepatitis B carriers via perinatal transmission. Unfortunately until serological tags for the non-A non-B hepatitis viruses are identified, there will be no effective vaccination for this form of hepatitis. Patients who already have acute or chronic viral hepatitis must await the advent of safe and effective antiviral agents for treatment of these viral infections.\r"

  ".W": "Antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of ischemic strokes and cerebral hemorrhage as complications of excessive or long-standing hypertension. However, neurologic dysfunction and brain damage may also accompany short-term, and under certain conditions, even long-term antihypertensive treatment. Therefore, treatment should be instituted restrictively and cautiously. Special regard should be given to the action of antihypertensive drugs on cerebral perfusion in patients with an increased risk for the development of treatment-induced cerebral ischemic complications, such as patients with hypertensive encephalopathy or autonomic dysfunction, and elderly patients with suspected sclerotic stenosis of cerebral or neck arteries. The structural and functional lesions of cerebral vessels observed in acute and chronic hypertension are reviewed, as are the effects of antihypertensive drugs on cerebral blood flow. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have advantages as first-line drugs in the treatment of patients with an elevated risk of cerebral hypoperfusion, because of the selective action of these agents on vasoconstricted vessels and their differential effects in varying regional vascular beds. The excellent efficacy of these drugs in the short- and long-term treatment of hypertension may lead to changes in the traditional management of hypertensive emergencies as well as in management strategies for other patients at risk for treatment-induced complications.\r"

In a consecutive series of 100 patients, one or two rearranged heavy chain genes could be detected in each of the 80 samples expressing clonal surface immunoglobulin. The kappa gene was rearranged in 70 percent of kappa-bearing tumors and in 23 percent of lambda-bearing specimens. Furthermore, a rearranged immunoglobulin gene was also observed in 21 of 29 lymphomas (nine from the consecutive series and 20 selected for surface immunoglobulin-negative status) in which B cell lineage was in doubt because of absent clonal surface immunoglobulin. These findings indicate that most cases of lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia in adults are of B cell lineage, even when phenotypic evidence is inconclusive. The exceptional cases (only 3 percent in the consecutive series) were of either follicular lymphoma or diffuse large cell (histiocytic) lymphoma subtype; the lineage in cases of diffuse lymphocytic lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia was never in doubt. Although the convenience of surface marker analysis assures its continuing clinical application, gene study resolves indeterminate cases and extends the understanding of the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative disease.\r"

At the end of a week's daily intake of an isocaloric diet containing 200 g of carbohydrate, all patients experienced a subjective improvement; the mean body weight was 55.5 +/- 15.4 kg (1 SD) compared with 56.0 +/- 16.0 kg during the control dietary period, the arterial carbon dioxide tension decreased from a mean of 56.9 +/- 6.7 to 50.9 +/- 6.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005), and the arterial oxygen tension increased from a mean of 50.6 +/- 7.3 to 62.0 +/- 14.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.02). After a week's intake of 50 g of carbohydrate in an isocaloric diet, the body weight and arterial oxygen tension did not change significantly, but the arterial carbon dioxide tension decreased still further to 48.0 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Mouth pressure at 100 msec after the start of inspiration, as a measure of respiratory center output, was significantly higher during both the low carbohydrate intakes compared with the control dietary period. The spirometric data, ventilation-perfusion distribution measurements, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production did not change significantly during various dietary periods. It is concluded that, under these short-term, hospital-controlled conditions, a reduction in the carbohydrate intake to 200 g a day improves the general well-being of patients with chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure, increases arterial oxygen tension, and decreases arterial carbon dioxide tension. A further reduction in the carbohydrate intake to 50 g a day provides further beneficial effects, and such a diet may be used in patients with intractable respiratory failure.\r"

In the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat, the authors previously observed an increased content of chondroitin sulfate, an increased incorporation of [35S]sulfate into proteoglycans, and qualitative alterations in the [35S]polysaccharides compared to the normotensive Wistar Kyoto rat. To determine if these differences were related to hypertension or to strain variations, normotensive and hypertensive Dahl S rats were studied. There was a significant elevation (70%) in the aorta content of chondroitin sulfate, whereas the dermatan sulfate and hyaluronic acid contents were similar in the two groups. The in vitro incorporation of [35S]sulfate was increased 2.6-fold in the hypertensive animals. No differences between the two groups were observed with respect to the gel chromatographic profiles of the [35S]proteoglycans or the charge density of the [35S]glycosaminoglycans, as assessed by ion exchange chromatography. It was concluded that the increase in chondroitin sulfate and [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans occurred as a result of hypertension, regardless of genetic factors.\r"

  ".W": "Calcification is the principal cause of failure of tissue-derived cardiac valve replacements pretreated with glutaraldehyde (GLUT). The objective of this study was to determine the role of GLUT-induced cross-links in bovine pericardial tissue calcification. Various levels of 3H-GLUT incorporation were obtained by varying incubation pH, and protein modification was determined by amino acid analysis and resistance to collagenase digestion. Calcification of cross-linked tissue was studied using subdermal implants in rats. Low GLUT uptake (less than 150 nm/mg) resulted in minimal calcification (Ca2+, 12.8 micrograms/mg) and stability (4% residual weight following digestion) due to a limited crosslinking (lysine + hydroxylysine = 26.1 residues/1000 amino acids [AA]). In contrast, higher GLUT uptake induced more cross-links (Lys + Hyl = 8.2 residues/1000 AA) and consequent higher stability (95% residual wt); such tissues calcified severely (Ca2+, 93.5 micrograms/mg). Incorporation of GLUT two to three times beyond a critical level did not further enhance calcification. It is concluded that the amount of GLUT incorporated controls the extent of cross-links, which in turn directly determines tissue stability and calcification.\r"

  ".W": "The authors investigated the distribution of interleukin-2 receptors (TAC antigen) in the lymph nodes of 300 patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. They used fresh-frozen sections to evaluate a possible correlation between the immunophenotype of specific lymphoid disorders and the presence or absence of TAC expression and to determine whether the TAC positivity of lymphoid cells contributes to the characterization of lymphoproliferative processes. All of the cases had previously been studied with a large screening panel of monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera. Among 85 patients with a variety of benign reactive processes, the lymph nodes from 47 contained TAC-bearing lymphocytes in various patterns of distribution. Of 41 patients with Hodgkin's disease, 37 had TAC-bearing lymphocytes. Of 26 B-cell, well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas (WDL), 14 were diffusely TAC-positive and one had TAC-bearing cells in random distribution. Six cases of intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma were also studied, and three showed randomly distributed TAC-bearing lymphocytes. Of 19 patients with follicular or follicular and diffuse, poorly differentiated lymphocytic (PDL) lymphoma, 14 were TAC-positive. All 3 diffuse PDL lymphomas studied were TAC-negative. Among 23 cases of B-cell and 5 cases of T-cell mixed cell lymphoma, 15 and three, respectively, had TAC-positive lymphocytes. Of 39 large cell lymphomas (B-cell, 33; T-cell, 6), 14 were TAC-positive. All 13 cases of hairy cell leukemia were diffusely positive. Of 23 T-lymphoblastic lymphomas, only 1 showed positive TAC reactivity, which was focal. Of 5 cases of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, 2 had TAC-bearing lymphocytes. Our study indicates that the TAC antigen is not lineage-specific, and that it may be expressed by lymphoid cells regardless of their phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "The ras oncogene p21 antigen (p21) has been identified in several epithelial malignancies, including breast, colon, bladder, and prostate. The pattern and intensity of immunoreactivity between normal and neoplastic tissues has been distinctly different. The authors examined thyroid lesions from 73 different cases by immunohistochemistry for the expression of p21 with a monoclonal antibody (RAP-5). Normal thyroid tissues (4) showed the least immunoreactivity, while papillary carcinomas (8), Hurthle cell carcinomas (10), and follicular carcinomas as (3) showed slightly more intense staining than Hurthle cell adenomas (12) or follicular adenomas (9). Anaplastic carcinomas (4) showed much less intense staining than most other carcinomas, while medullary thyroid carcinomas (5) showed only slight immunoreactivity. Inflammatory thyroid lesions associated with goiters, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (6) and Graves' disease (8), showed moderate to intense expression of p21 as did multinodular goiters (4). Semiquantitative analysis of staining intensity by serial dilution of the primary antibody showed significant differences in staining between normal thyroid and some carcinomas (P less than 0.05), but not between carcinomas and adenomas. These results show that while antibody RAP-5 detects an antigen that is only weakly expressed in normal thyroids, this antigen is more strongly expressed in benign and malignant thyroid tumors, as well as in inflammatory and nonneoplastic proliferative thyroid lesions. It is thus not helpful in identifying differences between neoplastic and non-neoplastic thyroid lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies showed that the prostaglandin-forming macrophages (M phi) induced in the spleens of CBA/J mice by intraperitoneal administration of Corynebacterium parvum (CP) could not be demonstrated following the depletion of bone marrow and blood monocytes with 89Sr. The present study compares prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and LTB4 release by splenic and resident peritoneal M phi in 89Sr-treated mice and 88Sr controls following in vivo CP and in vitro incubation with zymosan, calcium ionophore A23187, or phorbol ester (PMA). Intraperitoneal administration of CP resulted in the appearance of PGE2- and LTB4-releasing M phi in the spleens of control but not 89Sr mice. The incorporation and quantitative distribution of 3H-arachidonic acid into membrane lipids, however, were comparable in test and control mice. Neither zymosan nor any of the other stimulatory agents was able to effect significant release of PGE2 in vitro. No release of LTC4 by splenic M phi was detectable under experimental or control conditions. In contrast, the capacity of resident peritoneal M phi to release PGE2, LTC4, and LTB4 was apparently unaffected by 89Sr-induced bone marrow and monocyte depletion with virtually no demonstrable elicitation. Resident peritoneal M phi removed after CP in such mice showed a dramatic decrease in PGE2 release when incubated in vitro with zymosan, A23187, or PMA. These results, taken with earlier findings, demonstrate characteristically different phenotypic expression of metabolism of certain eicosanoids by splenic M phi from the spleen and the peritoneal cavity and suggest in addition that the induction of PGE2-synthesizing M phi in the spleen by CP is dependent on either an immigrant cell originating in the bone marrow or a regulatory agent derived from a bone marrow cell.\r"

The alpha-hCG immunoreactive cells were present in endocrinelike cells of non-neoplastic glands (6 fetuses older than 14th gestational week, 3 infants and 19 of 23 adults). Many of the positive cells were argyrophilic, and all were nonimmunoreactive for beta subunits of glycoprotein hormones. alpha-hCG immunoreactivity was also present in many argyrophilic cells of all carcinoid tumors and in some of the endocrine cell micronests. The immunoreactive cells for isolated beta-hCG were found in 14 infiltrating carcinomas. The distribution of hCG subunits was unbalanced, and both subunits may be expressed through an independent mechanism, commonly in normal and neoplastic rectosigmoid colon.\r"

In this study, the rejection process of combined heart-lung allografts was examined for determining whether it affects the lung and heart synchronously and whether it differs from rejection when these organs are transplanted alone. The lungs of the combined allografts were functionally rejected prior to the heart (6 and 11 days, respectively). Accordingly, the pathologic changes were most severe in the lungs. The rejection pathology of these combinedly transplanted organs was similar to that described for lungs and hearts transplanted separately, except that the airways were found to be more extensively involved than had been appreciated in previous studies. It is concluded that after combined transplantation the lung is more prone to rejection than the heart. On the basis of the present observations, the definition of sequential rejection phases in the lung was slightly altered.\r"

Five of these nine subjects and one of 22 subjects without such a history showed TSH blunting (TSH data were not available for one subject). This difference was statistically highly significant. Although there were sex differences in TSH response, TSH blunting occurred most frequently in men with a family or personal history of depression or alcoholism. The fault may have utility as a marker of past episodes or as a true marker of trait.\r"

The authors evaluated DST and TRH test results in 29 depressed hospitalized patients; both tests significantly discriminated patients with nonendogenous depression from those with endogenous depression. Furthermore, postdexamethasone cortisol levels but not the change in thyroid-stimulating hormone discriminated the patients with endogenous delusional depression from those with endogenous nondelusional depression.\r"

To evaluate the effectiveness of abstracting techniques in identifying nosocomial infections at discharge, discharge abstracts of patients with nosocomial infections were reviewed during September through November of 1984. Patients with nosocomial infections were identified using modified Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definitions and trained surveillance technicians. Records which did not include the diagnosis of nosocomial infections in the discharge abstract were identified, and potential lost revenues were estimated. We identified 631 infections in 498 patients. On average, only 57 per cent of the infections were properly recorded and coded in the discharge abstract. Of the additional monies which might be anticipated by the health care institution to assist in the cost of care of adverse events, approximately one-third would have been lost due to errors in coding in the discharge abstract. Although these lost revenues are substantial, they constitute but a small proportion of the potential costs to the institution when patients acquire nosocomial infections.\r"

The degree to which the fatty liver develops is dependent on total dietary fat intake. Both ethanol and carbon tetrachloride impair desaturation of linoleic acid and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and this appears to be relevant to the pathogenesis of fatty liver from two points of view. First, low arachidonic acid in liver phospholipids is associated with increased liver triacylglycerol content whether caused by ethanol, carbon tetrachloride, or essential fatty acid deficiency. Second, essential fatty acids including gamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid, as well as the prostaglandins, prevent ethanol- and carbon tetrachloride-induced fatty liver. Arachidonic acid and possibly the prostaglandins are therefore likely to be directly involved in lipoprotein and triacylglycerol secretion by the liver.\r"

Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) of serum estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were performed from blood collected before each alcohol administration. Results showed decreased elimination times, reduced areas under the BAC-time curve (AUCs), and faster disappearance rates associated with the midluteal menstrual phase compared to the early follicular and ovulatory phases which were consistent for both moderate and high alcohol doses. Decreased elimination times, smaller AUCs, and faster disappearance rates were associated with increased levels of progesterone, elevated progesterone to estradiol ratios, and decreased FSH levels. No differences were found in absorption time or peak BAC across phases of the menstrual cycle.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate in seven healthy volunteers the effect of RO 15-1788 on cerebral blood flow when intravenously injected alone or with midazolam and to compare its effects with midazolam administered alone. Cerebral blood flow was measured with the 133xenon inhalation technique and the drugs were administered simultaneously in a double-blind, randomized fashion during the four following sessions: placebo-placebo; midazolam-placebo; RO 15-1788-placebo; midazolam-RO 15-1788. No difference in cerebral blood flow was noted between the placebo-placebo, the RO 15-1788-placebo, and the RO 15-1788-midazolam sessions--although midazolam injected alone decreased cerebral blood flow by 30%. The sedation, amnesia, and the electroencephalograph (EEG) and muscle tone changes observed with midazolam-placebo were not present during the RO 15-1788-placebo and RO 15-1788-midazolam sessions. This study demonstrates the absence of effects of RO 15-1788 on cerebral blood flow when injected alone and the efficacy of this new drug in antagonizing the depressant effects of midazolam on cerebral hemodynamics.\r"

Seven animals received two countershocks of 30 delivered joules each, while six animals were not shocked but were atrially paced to a rate of 190-200, both with and without occlusion of the vena cava to produce a mean arterial pressure of 40-50 mmHg. All animals had substantially positive lactate extraction in the baseline state (36 +/- 10% for countershock group vs. 41 +/- 3% for pacing group). Myocardial lactate extraction reached a markedly negative nadir 2.5 min after countershock (-19 +/- 15%), but returned toward normal by 6 min (10 +/- 6%). Lactate extraction was not significantly changed from baseline in the pacing group. The relationship between changes in regional myocardial blood flow (radiolabeled microspheres) and post-countershock myocardial damage (technetium pyrophosphate uptake) was assessed in six dogs shocked as above. Mean myocardial blood flow was increased minimally immediately after countershock (0.78 +/- 0.08 ml X min-1 X g-1 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.3), but there was no difference in blood flow between damaged and undamaged tissue at either time point. The epicardial-to-endocardial ratio of blood flow was unchanged after countershock (0.97 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.08). There was no relationship between myocardial damage and either the absolute amount of blood flow after countershock (r = -0.03) or the change in blood flow compared with the pre-shock period (r = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Preliminary studies established the stability of the preparation (experiment 1) during two hours of observation and allowed estimation of (experiment 2) the concentration of BW755C that inhibited the HPV response by 50% (ED50 = 125 microM). In experiment 3, the rat lungs were subdivided into four groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A received the drug solvent, and B received 17 microM ibuprofen. Groups C and D received ibuprofen and, in addition, an ED50 dose of BW755C. The lungs were then tested for their response to hypoxia. In addition, groups C and D were tested for their response to 0.2 microgram Ang II. 0.5 MAC halothane was introduced into the ventilatory circuit of A, B, and D. Group C received no halothane. Responses to hypoxia and Ang II (groups C and D) were measured. Halothane was terminated and a further hypoxic response was tested in groups A and B. The results show, in group A, that the addition of halothane reduced the response to hypoxia from (mean +/- SE cm H2O) 13.4 +/- 1.56 to 6.5 +/- 1.28, a 50% reduction. The addition of ibuprofen in group B caused a 33% increase in the response, and the addition of halothane now caused only a 30% decrease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mediators with anticoagulant activities such as heparin and tryptase (fibrinogenolysis) and antithrombotic activity, PGD2, would appear to facilitate dispersion in tissues of the plasma ultrafiltrate brought there by the subgroup of mediators that enhance vasopermeability. In contrast, PAF causes platelet aggregation and chymase may cause arteriolar vasoconstriction (decreasing the volume of plasma reaching venules) by generation of angiotensin II. Assessment of any differential production of mediators by different types of mast cells will be of obvious importance in sorting out the physiologic responses to mast cell activation as well as the pathophysiology of allergic reactions.\r"

The mean pH gradient (pHa - pHcv) was .31 +/- .10 units and the mean PCO2 gradient (PcvCO2 - PaCO2) was 60.5 +/- 23.6 torr. This selective venous hypercarbia is probably due to a cardiac output that is inadequate to eliminate the CO2 produced from both residual aerobic metabolism and the buffering of anaerobically produced lactic acid. Central venous blood gases are probably a better reflection of actual tissue environment during prolonged cardiac arrest than are arterial blood gases.\r"

In contrast, human leukocyte elastase has similar specific activities on the 2 substrates. In addition, the bacterial enzyme is about 10 times more active on human elastin than the neutrophil elastase but the latter is about 5 times more active on bovine elastin than the former. In order to better quantitate these enzyme-substrate interactions, we have measured initial rates of elastolysis, derived from product versus time curves, as a function of elastin concentration. The substrate-velocity curves, analyzed using an equation similar to the classic Michaelis-Menten one, yielded 2 empirical kinetic parameters: [S50]-1, the apparent elastase-elastin affinity and Vm, the apparent catalytic efficiency of elastase. This analysis shows that human leukocyte elastase exhibits similar [S50]-1 and Vm values for the 2 elastins. The low activity of P. aeruginosa elastase on bovine elastin is due to the combined effects of low S50(-1) and Vm values, which could not be measured separately.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the early postoperative period, there was a moderate decrease in VC and TLC but gas exchange was maintained at essentially normal levels. The most conspicuous features of postoperative lung function were a very low airway resistance and an increase in FEV1/VC ratio above 95%. These alterations were associated with an unusual shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curve. Instead of showing a uniform decrease in expiratory flow as expiration proceeds to residual volume, the post-transplant MEFV curve showed a peak followed by a gently sloping plateau ending at a knee where flow suddenly fell. The knee occurred after exhalation of 80% VC. From the sixth postoperative month, the patient developed rapidly increasing air-flow obstruction, which proved to be due to obliterative bronchiolitis. As air-flow obstruction worsened, the knee on the MEFV curve progressively occurred at a higher lung volume, the flow plateau shortened, and flow after the knee became smaller at a given volume. From the ninth postoperative month, it was no longer possible to identify a plateau-knee configuration on the MEFV curve, which resembled that seen in severe obstructive airway disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten patients' cultures grew colonies of gentamicin-resistant enterococci--six after admission to the intensive care units and four after hospitalization on the medical ward. The initial sites of colonization were the rectal and perineal areas in seven patients, sternal wound in one, urine in one, and the rectal and perineal areas as well as urine after Foley catheter insertion in one. Nine patients died and three of the deaths were associated with enterococcal infection. The acquisition of resistant strains was associated with previous and more frequent exposure to antimicrobial agents, and with geographic clustering of patients. Resistant enterococci were isolated from the hands of hospital personnel and were frequently isolated from environmental surfaces. Nosocomial acquisition and interhospital spread of gentamicin-resistant enterococci was shown to have occurred when plasmid content was used as an epidemiologic marker.\r"

In this issue, Zervos and colleagues report findings from a prospective study in which they assessed the frequency of colonization and infection with such organisms at a university medical center, demonstrating probable person-to-person spread. Their findings suggest that hospitals should conduct systematic screening for enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin, that antimicrobial treatment habits be modified to limit the emergence of such organisms, and that rigorous infection control be practiced to minimize their spread. These observations are particularly timely because it has become clear that enterococci are extremely versatile pathogens which are both well suited for survival and capable of causing serious illness, especially in hospitalized patients treated with some of the newer broad-spectrum antibiotic agents. Enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin are also of growing concern because their resistance to many antibiotic agents severely limits the clinician's options for treatment.\r"

The permeability defects were unstable in vitro, with normalization after serial passage in antibiotic-free media. The variants grew as nonpigmented, small-colony types, with in vitro generation times approximately 1.5 to 2 times longer than that of the parental strain (30 to 40 versus 20 min, respectively). Two impermeability variants were compared with the parental strain for ability to induce experimental endocarditis in rabbits with aortic catheters. Both variants were virulent in vivo; however, mean bacterial densities in vegetations were approximately 2.5 log10 CFU/g lower in animals challenged with the variants than in animals challenged with the parental strain, probably reflecting a slower in vivo growth rate.\r"

This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.\r"

We developed a rat model of enterococcal endocarditis which permits comparison of continuous intravenous infusion of ampicillin with intramuscular therapy. Continuous low-dose ampicillin infusion (450 mg/kg [body weight] per day) was compared with the same dose given intramuscularly in three divided doses and with high-dose infusion (4.5 g/kg per day) of the drug. For the infecting strain of Streptococcus faecalis, the MIC and MBC were 1 microgram/ml. Mean ampicillin levels in serum were 53.9 +/- 4.8 (peak) and less than 1 (trough), 8.7 +/- 1.4, and 244 +/- 29 micrograms/ml for intramuscular, low-dose, and high-dose regimens, respectively. Ampicillin infusion therapy significantly increased the survival rate and sterilization of blood cultures. Continuous infusions were superior to intermittent therapy in eradicating bacteremia. After 5 days of treatment, low-dose ampicillin infusion was more effective than intermittent therapy in sterilizing cardiac vegetations (P less than 0.01). Continuous-infusion therapy at either dose was significantly more effective than intramuscular injection in reducing bacterial titers in cardiac vegetations (5.4 +/- 1.0 log10 CFU/g [low dose], 4.8 +/- 0.3 log10 CFU/g [high dose], and 7.7 +/- 0.3 log10 CFU/g [intramuscular]).

The O-acetylated form of the disaccharide pentapeptide was not detected among the major peaks. The correlation of antibiotic binding to gonococcal penicillin-binding protein 2 and accumulation of non-O-acetylated disaccharide pentapeptide suggested an explanation for the previously observed relationship of penicillin-binding protein 2 and O-acetylation of peptidoglycan.\r"

  ".W": "Tigemonam, a novel, orally administered monobactam, exhibited potent and specific activity in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Its activity was variable to poor against gram-positive bacteria, Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes. Within its spectrum of activity, tigemonam was far superior to oral antibiotics currently available, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In addition, tigemonam was superior to cefuroxime, which is under development as an oral pro-drug, and more active than cefixime against several genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. The activity of tigemonam against the enteric bacteria, Haemophilus species, and Neisseria species was, in general, comparable to that of the quinolone norfloxacin. The excellent activity of tigemonam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria reflected its marked stability to hydrolysis by isolated enzymes. The expanded spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria observed with tigemonam thus extends oral beta-lactam coverage to include members of the Enterobacteriaceae that are intrinsically or enzymatically resistant to broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins.\r"

In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor.

Both resistant variants were stably derepressed for the type Id beta-lactamase, which was ceftazidime inducible in the parental strain (PA-96) used to initially infect the rabbits. There was no evidence of ceftazidime bioinactivation by the resistant strains, and their outer membrane permeabilities were comparable to those of the parental strain. No alterations were observed in patterns of outer membrane proteins or membrane lipopolysaccharides in the resistant variants as compared with the parental strain. Penicillin-binding protein patterns of the resistant variants revealed the absence of penicillin-binding protein 4 in both, with acquisition of a new protein of higher apparent molecular weight in PA-60. Calculation of the rate of appearance of ceftazidime in the periplasm at sub-MICs suggested that slow enzymatic hydrolysis of the beta-lactam, rather than nonhydrolytic trapping, was the major explanation for the induced resistance in vivo in strains PA-48 and PA-60.\r"

The MICs of CGP 31608 against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., staphylococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were between 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of beta-lactamase-producing strains and known porin mutants of the Enterobacteriaceae suggests that CGP 31608 is resistant to many important beta-lactamases (including the mutationally derepressed chromosomal enzymes) and is not excluded from the bacterial cell in strains expressing these known porin mutations. Generally, CGP 31608 was less active than imipenem, Sch 34343, and the cephalosporins, except against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of CGP 31608 against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) was greater than that of the cephalosporins. The major target site in Escherichia coli K-12 for CGP 31608 was penicillin-binding protein 2. The serum protein binding of 5 micrograms of CGP 31608 per ml was 14%, and serum had little effect on activity.\r"

Six children had direct atrioventricular accessory pathways, of whom four had overt Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome on the 12 lead electrocardiogram, while in the other two the accessory pathway was concealed. Three children had nodal atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia, two had a re-entrant tachycardia, the exact mechanism of which was not known, one child had ectopic atrial tachycardia, and one had atrial flutter associated with an atrial septal defect. The remaining 12 children had structurally normal hearts. Flecainide (2 mg/kg intravenously) resulted in termination of the tachycardia in 11 of the 12 children treated during tachycardia. In 11 of the children successful prophylaxis was achieved with oral flecainide. Side effects occurred in two children during intravenous administration, but there were no side effects with oral treatment. This experience indicates that flecainide, which has not been used extensively in children, is an effective and safe antiarrhythmic agent, capable of terminating and controlling supraventricular tachycardia in children. Furthermore, flecainide may be successful where conventional agents fail.\r"

There was variation in the protective effects of verapamil and cromoglycate among the patients. Although cromoglycate produced an increase in PD20 in 53% of the children tested, the protection was not significant when compared with the placebo. Verapamil was partially protective, however, in 80% of children and achieved significantly better results than the placebo.

Rates of FFA oxidation have also been quantitated. Measurements were made in the basal state, during glucose infusion (4 mg/kg/min), and during total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Rates of glycerol and FFA appearance (Ra) in volunteers and NWL cancer patients were similar, and in both groups there was a significant suppression after glucose infusion. The basal Ra values for glycerol and FFA were 2.4 +/- 0.2 and 6.5 +/- 0.8 mumol/kg/min, respectively, in the volunteers, and in the NWL cancer patients the corresponding values were 2.7 +/- 0.4 and 7.1 +/- 1.1 mumol/kg/min (not significantly different). Compared with the volunteers, the rates of glycerol and FFA turnover were significantly elevated in both septic patients and WL cancer patients. The values for glycerol and FFA Ra were 6.3 +/- 1.1 and 13.1 +/- 3.0 mumol/kg/min, respectively, in the septic patients. The corresponding values were 4.1 +/- 0.4 and 11.7 +/- 1.6 mumol/kg/min in the WL cancer patients. In contrast to the response seen in the volunteers and NWL cancer patients, glucose infusion did not suppress lipolysis in either the septic or WL cancer patients. In all groups studied, glucose infusion resulted in an increase in FFA recycling. Despite the fact that the WL cancer patients had an increased FFA availability, they were significantly less able to oxidize either endogenous FFA or infused lipid when compared with NWL cancer patients (the basal % of FFA uptake oxidized in WL cancer patients was 10 +/- 2% vs. 18 +/- 3% in NWL cancer patients). In contrast, the septic patients had an enhanced capacity to oxidize either endogenous FFA or infused lipid (the basal % of FFA uptake oxidized was 40 +/- 8%, and during TPN this increased in 65 +/- 10%). From these studies the following was concluded: in terms of lipid kinetics, NWL cancer patients are not significantly different from volunteers; WL cancer patients and septic patients have elevated rates of lipolysis, and in contrast to what was seen in NWL cancer patients and in volunteers, glucose infusion in WL cancer patients and in septic patients does not result in a significant inhibition of lipolysis; and WL cancer patients have an impaired capacity to oxidize either endogenous FFA or infused lipid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These measures, before treatment, were higher in manic patients than in either depressed or normal subjects and correlated significantly with severity of mania. Levels in CSF of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid did not correlate with severity or with change during lithium carbonate treatment. Responders (about 70% of the patients) did not differ from nonresponders in pretreatment mania ratings or neurotransmitter measures. The CSF MHPG and urinary norepinephrine excretion were reduced during lithium carbonate treatment in both responders and nonresponders. Unlike the case before treatment, urinary MHPG excretion was higher during treatment in nonresponders than in responders and correlated with several indexes of symptom severity. These results support a relationship between mania and increased noradrenergic function. Treatment outcome, however, was not related exclusively to the reduction of noradrenergic indexes by lithium carbonate since reductions were similar in both responders and nonresponders. Reduced noradrenergic activity may therefore be necessary but not sufficient for successful outcome during lithium carbonate treatment.\r"

This places budgetary limitations on personnel, supplies, and equipment and ultimately has an impact on the quality of care. An alternative approach is to modify traditional practice patterns so that quality is preserved and costs are reduced. We reviewed elective class I and II coronary artery bypass graft surgery on a cost basis to identify potential problems. High costs in blood and blood-product usage were identified. An in-depth analysis of practice patterns was conducted, and comparisons were made between data from our hospital and other institutions. Modifications that improved quality and reduced costs were designed. Blood and blood-product usage was reduced from an average of 9.2 U to 3.4 U per case, resulting in an estimated cost avoidance of $111,286 per year. No cost advantage was observed with the use of cell savers, membrane oxygenators, or automated coagulation analysis in these routine short pump run surgeries. Though not cost-effective, the cell saver did allow the salvage of 2 U of blood per case. Mediastinal drainage systems (Sorenson) as well as reeducation regarding the safe, albeit low, hematocrit (no transfusions for hematocrits above 25% [0.25]) were effective in eliminating unnecessary use of potentially dangerous and expensive blood products.\r"

Ocular abnormalities include microphthalmia, cataract, immature anterior chamber angle, retinal dysplasia with or without retinal detachment, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, optic nerve hypoplasia, and coloboma. Skeletal muscle findings include fiber splitting, variable fiber size, and endomysial fibrosis. Recent evidence has shown that COD-MD syndrome may be identical to the Walker-Warburg (also known as Warburg) syndrome. Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy is similar to the COD-MD and Walker-Warburg syndromes, although the ocular manifestations are less severe.

Release of 3H-arachidonic acid (C20:4) and 3H-PGE2 from cells with phospholipids that were prelabeled with 3H-C20:4 did not occur in parallel. At 240 minutes, phospholipase activity in sonicated cell suspensions had increased only 38%, while cyclooxygenase activity had doubled (109%). This doubling, as well as the production of synoviocyte PGE2, was prevented by inhibiting the synthesis of protein. Cyclooxygenase is an inducible enzyme, and as such, it is a rate-controlling step in PGE2 production.\r"

Ten of these patients underwent emergency tumor debulking to relieve airway obstruction and to avoid emergency tracheotomy for airway control, and 23 had definitive treatment of superficial or frankly invasive carcinoma. Among the first group, all had an adequate airway after tumor debulking and could be treated with elective laryngectomy with or without radical neck dissection once their metabolic conditions had improved and they had been appropriately evaluated. Among the second group, two died of lung carcinoma but were free of laryngeal disease and two were lost to follow-up at one year. With a minimal three-year follow-up, six of the remaining 19 patients underwent additional laser procedures. None have required external laryngeal surgery or radiation therapy. Endoscopic laser therapy appears preferable to a more radical approach for carcinoma in situ, microinvasive carcinoma, or superficially invasive carcinoma of the larynx.\r"

The results with this method usually are good, but cases of overinjection with resultant poor voice, airway compromise, or both, do occur. The carbon dioxide laser has become a standard instrument for laryngeal surgery, and it might reasonably be used in attempts to correct the overinjected vocal cord. Realizing that Teflon could share flammable characteristics with other polymers, such as rubber and polyvinylchloride, we investigated the effect of the carbon dioxide laser on fresh polytef paste (Mentor O & O Inc, Hingham, Mass) before using it in a patient with an overinjected hemilarynx. Fresh paste was found to ignite after exposure to standard laser power at normal time settings, both in room air and in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere. To determine the effect of the laser on Teflon in situ, the paste was injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly into a rat. After a suitable interval of time, the Teflon was found to glow but not ignite when exposed to the laser under standard operating conditions. Only under high power in an oxygen-enriched environment did ignition occur. In our patient, the laser was used to incise the mucosa over the polytef granuloma, and standard microsurgical (nonlaser) techniques were used to complete the removal with good results. Laryngologists should be aware of the dangers of using the carbon dioxide laser on or near Teflon, especially in freshly injected vocal cords.\r"

All studies were completed before surgery commenced, and the children received no preoperative medication. The depression of ventilation produced by the three agents increased in a dose-related fashion as the alveolar concentrations were increased, and the depression of ventilation that they produced in oxygen was greater than that produced by equipotent concentrations in nitrous oxide. While the increase in ventilatory frequency and the decrease in TE associated with increasing concentrations of halothane were statistically significant (P less than 0.05), the increase in frequency associated with isoflurane was not, although it was sufficient to maintain the end-tidal and arterialized venous PCO2 in the isoflurane group at a value which did not differ significantly from that in the halothane group. Profound depression of ventilation was produced in the children by enflurane, clearly because no increase in ventilatory frequency was associated with its use. It was evident that the ventilatory effects of the three volatile agents in unstimulated children are very similar to those described elsewhere in the adult. There was no difference of any clinical significance between the degree of depression of ventilation produced by halothane and isoflurane in children.\r"

These changes remained significantly different from the control group for 60 min after injection. There was no effect on arterial pressure, heart rate or ventilatory rate and no anxiety states were observed. After initial complete awakening, sedation increased gradually in drug-treated patients, while in the control group, sedation scores and cognitive testing scores all diminished over the 4-h study period.

Mean tpa antigen was markedly increased in all three groups, but no correlation was observed between overall fibrinolytic activity as measured by the DWBCLT and the level of tpa antigen. In contrast, there was a significant correlation between overall fibrinolytic activity and tpa activity and an equally significant correlation between fibrinolytic activity and decreased tpa inhibition. Mean a2PI activity was significantly lower than normal in groups 1 and 2 but was normal in group 3. The pathogenesis of accelerated fibrinolysis in liver cirrhosis thus appears to depend critically on the capacity of plasma inhibitors to inhibit increased circulating tpa antigen. Reduced a2PI also appears to play a role.\r"

  ".U": "87185819\r", 
  ".W": "A two-site immunoradiometric assay for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen has been developed using immunoaffinity purified antibody. Various treatments enhanced the detection of tPA antigen in the plasma samples. Maximum detection was obtained by acidification of plasma to pH 4.8 to 6.5 or addition of 0.5 mol/L of L-lysine or L-arginine. Acidification or addition of lysine to plasma is also required for maximum immunoadsorption of plasma tPA antigen on anti-tPA-Ig-sepharose. These results indicate that plasma tPA antigen is partially cryptic to antibody in untreated plasma. The plasma tPA antigen isolated by immunoadsorption of either untreated plasma or acidified plasma on anti-tPA-Ig-sepharose consists mainly of a 100-kd plasminogen activator species as determined by fibrin-agar zymography. The 100-kd activity is possibly a tPA:inhibitor complex. A standardized sample preparation method was conveniently adopted by mixing 3 vol of plasma and 1 vol of 2 mol/L of L-lysine for the assay. Reconstitution and recovery studies showed that the method is specific and permits full detection of both free tPA and tPA:inhibitor complex. The validity of the assay is further supported by the finding that the spontaneous plasma fibrinolysis previously demonstrated to be dependent on plasma tPA antigen is correlated with tPA antigen content. Using the standardized assay, we found that tPA antigen concentrations in 16 blood bank plasmas are equivalent to 3.7 to 20 ng of 60 kd tPA/mL. In all the plasma tested, more than half of the antigen is undetected unless the plasma is treated as described above.\r"

  ".W": "The initiation and regulation of fibrinolysis has been studied by reconstitution of fibrinolytic activity in human plasma in vitro. Depletion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen by immunoadsorption of human plasma with anti-tPA Ig Sepharose 4B leads to total loss of spontaneous fibrinolytic activity determined by lysis of a thrombin-induced clot. Addition of physiological concentrations of purified tPA to tPA-depleted plasma restores fibrinolytic activity as a function of the length of time between tPA addition and clotting. Addition of free tPA to tPA-depleted plasma followed by immediate clotting results in a high rate of fibrinolysis. In contrast, when free tPA is allowed to incubate in plasma for 10 to 60 minutes prior to clot formation, the fibrinolytic activity of tPA is gradually lost. The loss of tPA-induced fibrinolytic activity in unclotted plasma is accompanied by decreased partitioning of tPA antigen into fibrin after clotting and is kinetically correlated with the formation of a 100 kilodalton (kDa) tPA complex as demonstrated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and fibrin-agar zymography. These results suggest that free tPA is susceptible to complexation by the plasma inhibitor in the absence of a clot. Fibrin formation renders tPA relatively inaccessible to inhibition. The tPA antigen isolated from stored plasma consists mainly of 100 kDa activity in SDS-gel electrophoresis and zymography, indicating that the tPA complex is resistant to dissociation by SDS. Upon rezymography of the sliced gel, only a 60 kDa tPA activity is found, suggesting that the activity at 100 kDa is at least partly due to free tPA dissociated from the complex during the first zymography. Conversion of tPA complex to enzymatically active free tPA also occurs with brief SDS exposure followed by incubation in the presence of excess Triton X-100 or by hydroxylamine treatment. These results reconcile the apparent discrepancy of the 100 kDA inhibitor-tPA complex manifesting plasminogen activation activity during zymography. The plasma tPA-inhibitor complex is precipitated strongly by antisera against plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) of human Hep G2 hepatoma and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells and weakly by antiserum against bovine aortic endothelial cell PAI but not by antiserum against a placental PAI (PAI-2) suggesting that the plasma inhibitor is immunologically related to Hep G2, HT-1080 and possibly endothedial cell PAIs. Based on the above findings, a simple model for the initiation and regulation of plasma fibrinolysis at the PA level has been formulated.\r"

We studied T cell IL-2R-specific modulation of adult bone marrow erythropoiesis by recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2). I3-2R were induced by CD3 T cell surface determinant-triggering and analyzed by cytofluorography. Bone marrow monocyte and T cell-depleted (NAB-T) target cells were assessed for early erythroid progenitor expression (BFU-E) in the presence of 0 to 10(3) U/mL of rIL-2, rIL-2 had no significant effect on BFU-E expression in the absence of T cells or in the presence of IL-2R-negative T cells. rIL-2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition (75% to 90%) of BFU-E in the presence of autologous IL-2R-positive T cells. The addition of anti-IL2-receptor antibody to cultures containing rIL-2 plus IL-2R-positive T cells entirely abrogated rIL-2-mediated inhibition of BFU-E. In the presence of rIL-2 (10(2) U/mL) production of interferon gamma (IF-gamma) by adult marrow CD3-triggered IL-2R-positive T cells was increased 37- to 125-fold compared to IL-2R-negative T cells. rIF-gamma caused a dose-dependent (88% +/- 17% at 10(3) U/mL) inhibition of adult BFU-E in the presence of CD3-triggered autologous T cells. rIL2-mediated inhibition of adult BFU-E in the presence of IL-2R-positive T cells was partially abrogated (52% +/- 16%) following addition of monospecific IF-gamma antibody. These results demonstrate (a) rIL-2 modulation of adult marrow erythropoiesis is selectively dependent upon both the presence or absence of autologous T cells and the IL-2R status of these T cells; and (b) rIL-2-induced inhibition of adult marrow erythropoiesis is mediated in part by release of IF-gamma from IL-2R-positive T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet membrane changes that accompany in vivo activation may be difficult to detect if only a small fraction of circulating platelets has undergone secretion. This study describes an approach to that problem by using a method to measure the number of molecules of fluorescein-labeled antibody bound to individual platelets by flow cytometry. The platelet response to different concentrations of thrombin was determined by measuring the binding of a monoclonal antibody (S12) to GMP-140, an alpha-granule membrane protein that becomes exposed on the platelet surface during alpha-granule secretion. Unstimulated platelets bound a mean of 1,120 molecules of S12 per cell, and 93% of platelets bound less than 2,000 molecules. Platelet stimulation by 0.25 U/mL thrombin caused maximum S12 binding with a mean of 7,529 molecules per cell. Even at low concentrations of thrombin (0.025 U/mL), 5% of platelets were maximally activated, binding over 7,000 molecules of S12 per cell. Conversely, at 0.25 U/mL thrombin, 13% of platelets continued to bind less than 2,000 molecules of S12 per cell. A mixture of as little as 5% thrombin-activated platelets with unstimulated platelets could be detected by this method. Therefore flow cytometry offers an important tool for investigating patients who may have circulating activated platelets as part of a disorder predisposing to thrombosis or hemorrhage.\r"

Northern blot analysis using a human M-CSF cDNA probe and a specific bioassay for human M-CSF were used to investigate the cellular sources of M-CSF. Expression of the M-CSF gene was induced in blood mononuclear cells stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or gamma-interferon. When mononuclear cells were fractionated into highly purified populations of T cells and monocytes, M-CSF transcripts were detected predominantly in monocytes. Further, monocytes stimulated with PMA released an M-CSF-like activity. These results demonstrate that M-CSF can be produced by activated cells of the macrophage lineage.\r"

An eight-year-old female with an increased bleeding tendency since infancy was found to have laboratory values typical of type IIA vWD, but her parents and siblings were asymptomatic. With the exception of uniformly decreased levels of ristocetin cofactor in relation to von Willebrand factor antigen, the results of family studies were normal including the presence of large multimeric forms of von Willebrand factor antigen. These findings are consistent with the propositus having the homozygous state of an autosomal recessive trait. Desmopressin infusion in the propositus was followed by a significant increase of factor VIII coagulant and von Willebrand factor antigen but a limited change in ristocetin cofactor with no development of large multimers.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we used a recently developed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique to measure ionized calcium in sickle erythrocytes. The NMR technique, which involves 19F NMR studies of a fluorinated calcium chelator quinMF, [2-(2-amino-4-methyl-5-fluorophenoxy)methyl-8-aminoquinoline-N,N,N',N'- tetraacetic acid] provides a novel approach to the study of ionized calcium in erythrocytes since the presence of hemoglobin precludes the use of fluorescent calcium indicators. The mean value for ionized calcium in oxygenated sickle erythrocytes was 18 +/- 2 nmol/L (SE). Experiments with normal RBCs gave a mean value of 21 +/- 2 nmol/L (SE). After 1 hour of deoxygenation, mean values for ionized calcium in sickle erythrocytes did not increase as compared with values obtained under oxygen. To investigate whether deoxygenation stimulated endocytosis, sickle erythrocytes were deoxygenated for 1 hour in the presence of impermeant FBAPTA (1,2 bis-(2-amino-5-fluorophenoxy) ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid). Cells were then separated from the extracellular medium and assayed for the presence of FBAPTA; they had incorporated significant quantities of the extracellular FBAPTA. This incorporation was not observed with normal erythrocytes. These data are consistent with at least a portion of the elevation in total cell calcium in sickle erythrocytes arising as a consequence of an endocytotic process in which extracellular calcium ions are incorporated into vesicles. Additional experiments show that these intracellular vesicles accumulate Ca2+ on further deoxygenation, consistent with a transient increase in ionized cell calcium. These studies represent the first use of NMR spectroscopy to evaluate endocytotic processes.\r"

We also used immunoblotting to examine the immunoglobulin class and subclass content of 12 inhibitors with monoclonal antibodies specific for human IgG subclasses and IgM. Seven hemophilic (alloantibody) and five spontaneous (autoantibody) inhibitors contained IgG-1 and IgG-4 antibody; one of the spontaneous inhibitors also contained IgG-3. In one hemophilic inhibitor, the IgG-4 component reacted strongly with the 92-kd and 80-kd polypeptides, whereas the IgG-1 component reacted only minimally with the 92-kd polypeptide although its reactivity with the 80-kd polypeptide was strong. Another hemophilic inhibitor was affinity purified and subjected to quantitative radial immunodiffusion, and the presence of IgG-1 and IgG-4 antibody was confirmed. We conclude that the inhibitors examined are not monoclonal but are probably of restricted polyclonal origin and that different IgG subclasses in an inhibitor plasma can have different degrees of FVIII polypeptide reactivity.\r"

Scatchard plot analyses show that the 125I-labeled antibody (iodo-gen procedure), binds to 1.09 X 10(5), 0.43 X 10(5), and 0.32 X 10(5) antigen sites on each D--/D--, R2R2 and R1R1 RBC, respectively, with an association constant of approximately 0.6 X 10(8) mol/L-1. Immune precipitation studies indicate also that the Rh(D) antigen of the Rh(D)-positive RBCs is carried by a 29 kd polypeptide as deduced from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). No material could be precipitated from Rh(D)-negative or Rhnull RBCs. These results indicate that the monoclonal and the polyclonal human anti-Rh(D) behave similarly. A sample (Blo., presumed genotype R2r or R0R2) showing an increased number of antigen sites (0.76 X 10(5)/cell) and a high binding constant (5.7 X 10(8) mol/L-1) was used, as well as D--/D-- RBCs, for further purification of the 29-kd component. Extraction by Triton X-100 (0.1% to 5%) of the immune complexes formed between the membrane-bound Rh(D) antigens and the monoclonal antibody as well as a direct quantitative estimate of the 29-kd component, suggest that the Rh(D) polypeptide is loosely bound to the skeleton, since less than or equal to 80% can be solubilized from the membrane. In similar conditions, glycophorin A showed a slight association with the Triton-insoluble residue, whereas glycophorin B was easily and completely extracted. In contrast, both the minor RBC sialoglycoproteins, glycophorin C and glycoprotein gamma, remained predominantly bound to the membrane skeleton. The purified Rh(D) polypeptide obtained from Blo. and D--/D-- RBCs by immunoprecipitation and preparative gel electrophoresis was homogenous as judged by SDS-PAGE. Amino acid composition indicated that the Rh(D) protein contained sulfhydryl groups which are essential for biological activity.\r"

These multimers were shown by immunofluorescent staining to bind more extensively to the extracellular matrix of human foreskin fibroblasts than constitutively secreted vWf, which is composed predominantly of dimeric molecules. Increased binding of A23187-released vWf was not due to another component present in the releasate, since releasate from which vWf was adsorbed, when added together with constitutively secreted vWf, did not promote binding. When iodinated plasma vWf was overlaid onto the fibroblasts, the large forms bound preferentially to the matrix. These results indicated that the enhanced binding of the vWf released from the Weibel-Palade bodies was likely due to its large multimeric size. It appears that multivalency is an important component of vWf interaction with the extracellular matrix, just as has been shown for vWf interaction with platelets. The pool of vWf contained within the Weibel-Palade bodies, therefore, is not only especially suited for platelet binding, but also for interaction with the extracellular matrix.\r"

In contrast, the Xbal intron 22 polymorphism was useful in 53% of women who were uninformative (homozygous) for either the BclI or BglI polymorphisms. Using the BclI/intron 18 and Xbal/intron 22 intragenic polymorphisms, we could provide highly accurate information for 68% of women we studied who were at risk for carriership.

Gamma interferon, which resulted in a slight decrease in c-myb but no change in c-fos or c-myc expression, had a transient antiproliferative effect without a morphological or functional differentiation of THP-1 cells. Resting human peripheral blood monocytes have a high c-fos, a low c-myc, and no detectable c-myb expression. These findings suggest that a switch in c-fos/c-myb expression is associated with the terminal differentiation of cells of the monocytic lineage.\r"

Arthritis comprised 44% of the rheumatological topics taught; there was a noticeable lack of teaching on problems commonly encountered in general practice, such as soft tissue rheumatism and injury and back pain, and on clinical skills including examination and injection of joints. Eighty eight respondents made comments and suggestions. The favoured educational strategies were small group teaching, apprenticeship schemes, and interchange between general practitioners and consultants about shared cases. This contrasts with what was typically done--namely, formal lectures on rheumatoid arthritis in postgraduate medical centres. These findings raise questions about the continuing education of consultants themselves as well as about the consultants' role in teaching others.\r"

Renal abnormalities were found in 33 of the 49 primiparas (67%) and in 22 of the 35 multiparas (63%). Two thirds of the multiparas with pre-eclampsia before 37 weeks with a diagnosis of either essential hypertension or renal disease had recurrent pre-eclampsia. Maternal morbidity and fetal mortality were greater in the group with early onset pre-eclampsia than in a group with late onset disease. Idiopathic pre-eclampsia occurred in 10% of primiparas in the early onset group, whereas it was the main condition in over three quarters of primiparas in the late onset group. A presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic pre-eclampsia is likely to be correct only in primiparas who develop the disease after 37 weeks of pregnancy; in all other cases careful search will almost certainly detect an underlying abnormality, predominantly renal.\r"

Conventional treatment including exchange transfusions and mechanical ventilation was to no avail, and an infusion of epoprostenol also failed to halt her worsening condition. When her arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) had fallen to 6.5 kPa (49 mm Hg) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was instituted. Within two days her PaO2 was greatly improved (maximum 11.6 kPa; 87 mmHg), and by the sixth day pulmonary vascular resistance was reduced and angiography showed reperfusion of many vessels. The patient recovered and six months later showed a transfer factor close to the predicted range and normal spirometric values. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered for severe sickle chest syndrome when conventional methods of artificial ventilation fail.\r"

Four were admitted with pulmonary oedema and three in cardiogenic shock and one had angina at rest. With the use of echocardiographic and radiographic guidance percutaneous transluminal aortic valvuloplasty was carried out. Aortic gradients were reduced by an average of 40%. All four patients who presented with cardiac failure improved immediately and remained well six months later. The patient with angina was symptom free at nine months. Two of the three patients who presented in cardiogenic shock improved immediately and were well nine and three months later. The other patient died four hours after the procedure. Doppler echocardiographic studies showed a slight initial increase in aortic incompetence, but this did not worsen and valvar gradients remained improved three and six months later. Percutaneous valvuloplasty of the aortic valve is an effective therapeutic option in patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis who are unfit for surgery. Its role as an alternative to surgery has not been considered and should be investigated in a controlled clinical trial.\r"

The pattern of mortality shortly after both censuses suggests that sick unemployed men were not categorised as seeking work, and it is concluded that for both samples the mortality of those who were reported to be seeking work was raised for reasons other than initial poor health. Other findings from the two censuses are also broadly similar. If confirmed after longer follow up this will add considerably to the evidence of the adverse health consequences of unemployment.\r"

The use of and response to laboratory investigations for iron deficiency were generally appropriate, but many practitioners probably do not check for a response to oral iron sufficiently early during treatment or stop prescribing supplements before iron stores have been replenished. There is scope for further education in the biology and management of iron deficiency in general practice.\r"

Results were compared with those in a matched control group of seven patients treated by splenectomy. All patients treated by partial splenic embolisation showed a reduction in blood transfusion requirements comparable with those in the controls and which remained unchanged over the five years. Serious infections that commonly occur in patients splenectomised for thalassaemia did not occur after embolisation, presumably owing to preservation of some immune function by the splenic remnant. By contrast with the change in platelet counts seen after splenectomy, platelet counts remained normal after partial splenic embolisation, so reducing the risk of thromboses. On the other hand, pre-existing leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were corrected after embolisation. It is concluded that partial splenic embolisation provides an alternative to splenectomy for thalassaemia major and is equally effective and much safer.\r"

  ".U": "87186188\r", 
  ".W": "A study was conducted aimed at establishing a range of plasma concentrations of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin that might predict ectopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer. From May 1984 to February 1986, 161 consecutive pregnancies at the Monash University in vitro fertilisation unit were analysed by determining plasma beta human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations between two and 10 weeks after oocyte collection. Eighty eight ongoing singleton pregnancies, 25 multiple pregnancies, 27 first trimester spontaneous abortions, 12 anembryonic pregnancies, and nine ectopic pregnancies resulted from these conception cycles. When compared with values for ongoing singleton pregnancies two weeks after oocyte collection plasma beta human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations in ectopic pregnancies were significantly lower (p less than 0.05; Wilcoxon rank sum test). Two weeks after oocyte collection all plasma beta human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations in the set of ectopic pregnancies were below 30.6 IU/l, which corresponded to the lower quartile (25th percentile) of beta human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations in ongoing singleton pregnancies. The beta human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration corresponding to the lower quartile of ongoing singleton pregnancies at each week of gestation was used to derive the predictive value of various statistics in detecting ectopic pregnancy in patients after in vitro fertilisation. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a positive result, predictive value of a negative result, and efficiency of a single plasma beta human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration in predicting ectopic pregnancy were 100%, 68.1%, 16.7%, 100%, and 70%, respectively, two weeks after oocyte collection. These results suggest that a single determination of the plasma beta human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration beginning 14 days after oocyte collection is clinically useful in predicting the outcome of pregnancy achieved by in vitro fertilisation. Ectopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilisation is more likely when beta human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration is below the lower quartile of values in ongoing singleton pregnancies achieved by the technique.\r"

A total of 39,207 men were followed up for an average of 8.9 years; 385 died of coronary heart disease. Diastolic blood pressure seemed to be the better predictor, the difference being most pronounced in the age group 35-39. At this age 26% more deaths from coronary heart disease were found in the upper quintile of diastolic blood pressure compared with the upper quintile of systolic blood pressure. At ages 45-49 there were almost the same numbers of deaths from coronary heart disease in the upper quintiles of systolic and diastolic pressures. These findings suggest that the relative predictive strength of systolic and diastolic blood pressure may be dependent on age. Furthermore, for very obese men the association between blood pressure and death from coronary heart disease is much weaker.\r"

Pinch skin grafting may allow healing from epithelial islands throughout the surface area of the ulcer, and a prospective randomised trial was therefore conducted comparing this treatment with porcine dermis dressings. Most patients were treated as outpatients, 25 ulcers being randomised to treatment with pinch skin grafts and 28 to treatment with porcine dermis. Though the groups were well matched, the mean healing rate in the first week was 15 cm2 for pinch skin grafts compared with 3.5 cm2 with porcine dermis (p less than 0.02). By life table analysis 64% of ulcers treated by pinch grafts were healed at six weeks and 74% by 12 weeks compared with 29% and 46% of ulcers, respectively, treated with porcine dermis dressings (chi2 = 4.1; p less than 0.05). All ulcers that failed to heal within 12 weeks included an area posterior to the medial malleolus, where local compression may have been inadequate. Pinch skin grafting improves the rate of healing in large venous ulcers and is a simple technique that may be performed as an outpatient procedure under local anaesthesia.\r"

A further nine patients underwent surgery after responding initially to intensive medical treatment that did not check the attack. There were no deaths from acute colitis. Thirteen patients underwent elective surgery for ulcerative colitis, and there were no deaths. The prognosis for acute colitis in district general hospitals has improved.\r"
