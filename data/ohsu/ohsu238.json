  ".W": "The physiological role of glucagon-like peptide-1 7-36 amide (GLP-1 7-36) in man was investigated. GLP-1 7-36-like immunoreactivity was found in the human bowel; its circulating level rose after oral glucose and after a test breakfast. When it was infused into seven volunteers at a rate to mimic its postprandial plasma concentration in the fasting state, plasma insulin levels rose significantly and glucose and glucagon concentrations fell. During an intravenous glucose load, it greatly enhanced insulin release and significantly reduced peak plasma glucose concentrations, compared with a control saline infusion, even inducing postinfusion reactive hypoglycaemia. By comparison, infusion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) to physiological levels was less effective in stimulating insulin release. These observations suggest that GLP-1 7-36 is a physiological incretin and that it is more powerful than GIP. The observation of greatly increased postprandial plasma GLP-1 7-36 levels in patients with postgastrectomy dumping syndrome suggests that it may mediate the hyperinsulinaemia and reactive hypoglycaemia of this disorder.\r"

The West African isolates were more sensitive to halofantrine than to mefloquine. Since neither mefloquine nor halofantrine has been used in West Africa, the findings suggest that P falciparum may be inherently resistant to mefloquine and that mefloquine should be introduced cautiously to West Africa. Moreover, halofantrine may be of greater value than mefloquine for controlling multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria in West Africa.\r"

Of the eight prospective randomised controlled trials designed to assess its value in obstetric care, four were concerned with mothers defined as being at high-risk, three with normal or low-risk patients, and the eighth with the total population of a maternity hospital over several months. None suggested any major advantage of continuous fetal heart rate monitoring over intermittent surveillance in terms of neonatal mortality, morbidity, cord blood pH values, or the five minute Apgar score. The rates of caesarean section and forceps delivery were higher in the continuously monitored group. For low-risk mothers there is a good case for a return to the traditional method of intermittent auscultation with its lower false-positive rate, lesser incidence of intervention, and opportunity for greater contact between the maternity care staff and the mother.\r"

Four hundred sixty-five 4-minute samples obtained from 18 patients in a clinical studies unit were analyzed and rated as to severity. Agreement between polysomnography and sleep sonography was very high in scoring the respiratory pattern (r = 0.79) and detecting apnea (r = 0.89). These findings demonstrate that sleep sonography is a reliable method for evaluating patients with upper airway obstruction due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy.\r"

In the latter instance, whether the disease originated in the glandular stroma itself or in a paraglandular lymph node and then invaded the stroma, the lymphoma is defined as primary, as long as there is no detectable disease outside the salivary gland. Five cases of primary salivary gland lymphomas are described. All had a complete clinical staging including chest x-ray, bilateral bone marrow biopsy, liver-spleen scan, bilateral pedal lymphangiography and/or abdominal CT scan. There was no evidence of lymphoma outside the gland in any of the patients described; hence, these can be labeled as primary lymphomas of the salivary gland. Review of the literature suggests that this presentation of the disease is extremely rare. Although 324 cases of salivary gland lymphomas have been described in the literature, only six may be considered primary by our criteria. The remaining patients were either not adequately staged or had documented evidence of disease elsewhere at the time of diagnosis. The diagnosis of primary salivary gland lymphoma should not be made unless complete staging is performed.\r"

Blood pressure (BP) and state anxiety were assessed prior to and following the conditions. In the first experiment, 15 normotensive Ss were assessed during the 3-h following the treatments. The results revealed that state anxiety and BP were reduced following both conditions. The exercise-induced BP reductions remained significant for 2 to 3 h (P less than 0.05), whereas the BP reductions returned to baseline within 20-min following cessation of quiet rest. The second experiment involved an evaluation of the effects of exercise and quiet rest on 15 pharmacologically controlled hypertensive Ss. A significant reduction in systolic BP (P less than 0.05) was observed following exercise and quiet rest. State anxiety was reduced following quiet rest and exercise (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that exercise and quiet rest have similar effects on state anxiety, and both conditions are followed by a transitory reduction in blood pressure. These anti-anxiety effects, however, are sustained for a longer period following exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The combined influence of diabetes and moderate treadmill exercise training on select metabolic and cardiovascular parameters was investigated with mature male Sprague-Dawley rats assigned to either control diabetic or diabetic groups receiving exogenous insulin. Experimental diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (80 mg.kg-1, i.v.) and verified by blood glucose concentrations greater than 16 mmol. The animals were designated as control, insulin-injected (5 U.kg-1, twice daily), or saline-injected (twice daily), and assigned to either non-trained or trained sub-groups. Insulin treatment partially restored the measured physiological functions to within normal limits. All animals were trained at 60 to 70% maximal oxygen consumption for 9 wk and exhibited higher maximal oxygen consumption values and cytochrome oxidase activity of the soleus muscles. Diabetes caused lower (P less than 0.05) reductions in resting heart rate but training-induced bradycardia did not occur in any group. Heart rate response to atropine sulfate (1 mg.kg-1, atrial choline acetyltransferase activity, atrial acetylcholine concentration, and quinuclidinyl benzilate binding was measured to evaluate changes in the parasympathetic nervous system. Atropine-induced cardiac acceleration was most pronounced in control and least effective in diabetic animals. Endurance training had no meaningful influence on this response to cholinergic inhibition. Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding for the diabetic and the diabetic groups receiving insulin revealed no change in receptor number, receptor affinity, or training effects. These findings indicated that 9 wk of exercise training improves the aerobic capability of insulin-deficient rats without changing cardiovascular characteristics associated with the parasympathetic nervous system.\r"

Psychologists have developed theoretical models of self-regulation and produced principles of self-regulation that are summarized by the models. These concepts apply directly to sport performance. The purpose of this paper is to review the most relevant concepts in self-regulation and show how they impact on sport psychology. Several studies are reviewed which have used self-regulatory concepts to help both elite and ordinary athletes improve their performance. For example, the research indicates that when performance is difficult (e.g., at low and moderate skill levels), performance can be improved by keeping track of successes while performing or while viewing videotapes of one's own performance. Keeping track of instances of inadequate performance may prove detrimental except if the tasks being monitored are extremely easy or routine. How to apply this principle and others to sport performance is discussed.\r"

The results of 34 studies having 92 effect size estimates from 1,449 subjects were statistically combined to compare psychosocial stressor tasks and arousal measures. The average effect size estimate of 0.48 was significantly different from zero (P less than 0.01), indicating that aerobically fit subjects had a reduced psychosocial stress response compared to either control group or baseline values. The test for the homogeneity assumption showed that it could not be rejected, and thus none of the proposed moderating variables altered the aerobic fitness-psychosocial reactivity relationship. Various underlying mechanisms which may contribute to this response are discussed, and future research directions are presented.\r"

  ".U": "88065010\r", 
  ".W": "Exercise requires the integrated activity of neuromuscular systems controlling skeletal, cardiac, and vascular smooth muscle. However, exercise can be defined at the most basic cellular level. Therefore, in order to effectively study the specific cellular events involved in the activity of each system, it is necessary to first isolate and control the major neurogenic, myogenic, and humoral components of neuromuscular activity. For example, these components of activity are differentially involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptors. The increased concentration of intracellular free calcium during contraction (an event classified as a myogenic component of activity), rather than trophic factors from the motoneuron (neurogenic component) and hormonal factors (humoral component), is a major regulator of acetylcholine receptor expression. The degree of experimental control increases as one progresses from the experimental approaches involving the exercising human to the single cell studied in vitro. It has been possible only by cell culture techniques to identify specific intracellular messengers, e.g., calcium, that mediate the effect of neuromuscular activity on acetylcholine receptor expression. The wide variety of in vitro techniques now available permit the selection of appropriate models. Therefore, the use of various in vitro methods by exercise physiologists seems justified. In vitro methods provide a valuable dimension to the study and understanding of neuromuscular activity in the intact organism.\r"

In vitro systems provide stable conditions for intra- and extra-cellular recordings and enable pharmacological and ionic manipulations of the neuronal environment. Studies of motor activity generated by isolated spinal cord have revealed the existence of co-ordinated motor output from early in development, in which antagonist motoneurons alternate in their activity and synergists are co-active. Intra-cellular recordings from single neurons and electronic recordings from muscle nerves have provided insight into the mechanism of flexor and extensor alternation. These studies have revealed that flexor and extensor motoneurons receive a similar de-polarization during each cycle of motor activity, but that the two classes of motoneuron process the de-polarization differently. Flexors fire late in each cycle whereas extensors fire early, which leads to a pattern of alternation. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the differences in the firing behavior of flexor and extensor motoneurons are currently being investigated using techniques that are only possible using the in vitro preparation.\r"

  ".W": "Muscle genes are developmentally regulated. In vivo, the differential expression of muscle structural genes during myogenesis is controlled in complex ways by extrinsic factors and by a pre-determined genetic program. Terminal differentiation, which is achieved when differentiated myoblasts fuse to form multi-nucleated myotubes, appears mainly regulated by intrinsic factors. Environmental components, on the other hand, play a significant role in the developmental regulation of genes during the course of muscle fiber maturation. In culture, the differential expression of muscle genes is assumed to be solely controlled by intrinsic genetic factors, in the sense that, once precursors cease to proliferate and are committed to become myoblasts, they inevitably progress through terminal differentiation, whatever the environment. The system lacks the necessary elements to proceed towards fiber maturation. Consequently, muscle culture models have, until recently, been limited in studies dealing with the roles played both by genetic and environmental factors in the regulation of muscle gene expression. The accumulating data, however, suggest that under given culture conditions, it is becoming possible to make cells mature beyond embryonic stages and express specific phenotypes in response to extrinsic factors. This paper reviews some of the progress in the development of culture systems which will be useful in studies of muscle plasticity.\r"

  ".W": "Tension is an important regulator of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in vivo. When increased constant tension is applied to embryonic skeletal muscle fibers differentiated in a tissue culture environment, many of the same biochemical processes associated with muscle hypertrophy in vivo are also stimulated in vitro, e.g., sodium-dependent amino acid transport, Na+,K+-ATPase (sodium pump) activity, protein synthesis, total protein, and myosin heavy chain accumulation. The molecular mechanisms by which tension induces these growth-related changes are unknown, but several models have been tested using whole animal, organ-cultured muscle, and tissue culture model systems. In tissue culture, activation of the plasma membrane sodium pump is closely coupled to, and essential for, stretch and serum-induced skeletal muscle growth. Long-term membrane hyperpolarization is not associated with this sodium pump activation, and muscle growth in vitro is unrelated to the myotube's resting membrane potential, since growth can occur under de-polarizating conditions. Medium growth factors are essential for stretch-induced muscle growth in tissue culture. In medium without growth factor supplements, stretch is able to reduce the rate of atrophy of the cultured muscle cells which are in negative nitrogen balance, but the muscle cells are unable to grow in response to stretch without the presence of some as yet undefined growth factor or factors present in serum. As newer tissue culture environments are designed for growing embryonic skeletal muscle under more in vivo-like conditions, a more complete analysis of the mechanisms by which a physical stimulus (tension) is translated into the biochemical alterations leading to muscle growth will be possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88065014\r", 
  ".W": "The integrated use of several energy sources allows high muscular power outputs to be sustained. Muscle glycogen provides the major fuel source for muscular exercise, but other fuels can provide alternative energy sources which allow for muscle glycogen-sparing and an increased potential for prolonged high metabolic rates. Blood-borne glucose, derived from liver glycogenolysis and glyconeogenesis, as well as intra-muscular lipids and plasma free fatty acids derived from adipose tissue provide the main energy alternatives to muscle glycogen. Several amino acids, including the essential amino acid leucine, are also used directly as oxidizable fuels during exercise. Depending on the duration and intensity of exercise and other factors such as glycogen stores and energy intake, amino acids can provide from a few to approximately 10% of the total energy for sustained exercise. Additionally, many amino acids can be converted to glutamate (via glutamate dehydrogenase) and then to alanine (via glutamate-pyruvate transaminase). Alanine, along with lactate and pyruvate, are recognized as the major gluconeogenic precursors. Via this mechanism, several amino acids play crucial roles in providing the carbon sources for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis during exercise and glycogen restitution during recovery. And finally, during exercise and recovery, amino acids likely play important anaplerotic functions sustaining the whole metabolic apparatus.\r"

  ".U": "88065015\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, several authors have recommended protein intakes as high as 2 to 3 g X kg body weight-1 X d-1 for physically active individuals. Review of the literature cited to support this recommendation, as well as other published and unpublished work, suggests that there are at least three variables which have not been sufficiently controlled or investigated in much of the research done, making such a recommendation premature. These variables are timing of sampling relative to initiation of an exercise program (training), energy and protein intake associated with activity, and intensity of exercise performed. Several investigators report a 12- to 14-d adaptation period following initiation of an activity program during which nitrogen (N) balance falls and then returns near to equilibrium. Data collected during this adaptation period can be expected to reflect a more negative N balance than data collected after that time. Butterfield and co-workers have found that exercise at 40 to 50% of maximal oxygen consumption actually promotes N retention in previously untrained men given sufficient time to adjust to the new exercise regimen, allowing maintenance of N equilibrium on a marginal protein intake. Energy intake, energy balance, and quantity of protein ingested inter-act in this effect. Finally, recent experiments suggest that, at high intensity activities, energy balance becomes even more critical in the utilization of protein: when energy balance is negative, an intake of protein as high as 2 g X kg body weight-1 X d-1 may be inadequate to maintain N equilibrium in previously trained individuals exercising at 64% of maximal oxygen consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During endurance exercise, there is a net breakdown of body protein and the amino acids so mobilized are available for increased rates of oxidation and gluconeogenesis. At least part of the net loss of protein is due to a decrease in the rate of protein synthesis during exercise. Liver protein degradation is increased during exercise as a result of autophagy and proteolysis of cell material inside the secondary lysosomes. The rate of degradation of contractile proteins is decreased during exercise but is increased during the recovery period if the exercise is of high intensity and of long duration. Preliminary evidence suggests that the rate of degradation of non-contractile proteins in muscle may be increased at the same time that contractile protein degradation is decreased.\r"

  ".W": "Currently, the recommended dietary allowance for protein determined for sedentary individuals is assumed to be adequate for athletes. However, several types of evidence (in vitro, in situ, and in vivo) indicate that exercise causes substantial changes in protein metabolism. In fact, recent data suggest the protein recommended dietary allowance may actually be 50 to 100% higher for individuals who exercise on a regular basis. Optimal intakes, although unknown, may even be higher, especially for individuals attempting to increase muscle mass and strength. The reasons why the recent experimental results contradict older studies are complex and not fully understood. However, dietary (total energy input, percent of each foodstuff, accommodation to treatments), exercise (type, frequency, intensity, duration, training, environment), and methodological (in vitro, in situ, in vivo) considerations are likely very important. This paper reviews the recent findings and discusses their implications to exercise performance. Although, definitive recommendations regarding optimal protein intakes for various athletic groups are not yet possible, it appears that exercise increases protein needs. It is hoped that well-controlled studies will be completed in the near future so that such recommendations will soon be possible.\r"

Possible causes of this iron depletion include inadequate iron intake especially among females and increased iron excretion through sweating and gastrointestinal blood loss. Animal studies suggest that iron deficiency without anemia can reduce endurance by lowering tissue cytochromes and the activity of certain muscle tissue enzymes. Iron supplementation appears to be beneficial in reducing blood lactate concentrations following heavy exercise. The amount of iron in the supplement appears to influence the amount of increase in hemoglobin and serum ferritin.\r"

  ".W": "An understanding of the biologic characteristics and cellular tropism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is critical to appreciate the diverse neurologic manifestations of HIV infection in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Only carefully designed prospective studies can provide information regarding prevalence, incidence, and natural history of the full spectrum of neurologic complications of HIV infection. A degree of tropism for monocyte/macrophages and possibly for cells within the CNS seems certain. One of the most frequent complications is AIDS-related dementia, which reflects central nervous system invasion by HIV. Despite the evidence linking unchecked viral replication within the brain and progressive dementia, the basic pathogenetic mechanisms remain obscure. Further characterization of the cellular targets of HIV within the brain, and the mechanisms which ultimately lead to the dementia, is critical. The demonstration that HIV enters the central nervous system during the earliest stages of infection has major implications for antiviral agents which must penetrate brain parenchyma to clear the virus effectively. Other neurologic complications occur frequently, including myelopathies, peripheral neuropathies, opportunistic CNS infections, and CNS neoplasms. Many of these disorders are novel and incompletely characterized and their etiology is uncertain. While treatment is available for several of these conditions, it is generally not curative, and is often poorly tolerated because of adverse effects. Research directions will focus on better understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms, on earlier and more precise detection of these diverse conditions, and on improved therapeutic agents. For the future, efforts toward the development of a safe, effective vaccine are of critical importance. There are, however, already up to 2 million individuals in the United States who are already infected with HIV and who are thus at risk for developing 1 or several of these neurologic complications. Vaccination, even if it were available now, is not likely to benefit these individuals. While it is hoped that only a fraction of this infected population will develop neurologic symptoms, the prospects of an epidemic of AIDS-related dementia are ominous, particularly as antiviral therapy alone is unlikely to either eradicate the virus or restore brain function. In Africa and worldwide the numbers at risk for HIV-related diseases are enormous, and the risk factors for transmission of HIV less well defined. There, economic and medical resources are less than adequate to deal with a problem of this magnitude.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is an increasingly recognized complication of cirrhosis with ascites. However, the presence of ascites from any cause appears to be a risk factor for this infection. The etiology of SBP is multifactorial, including derangements in the reticuloendothelial system, abnormalities of both the serum and ascitic fluid humoral immune systems, and systemic bacteremia. Gram-negative enteric pathogens are the etiologic agents in 70% of the cases; anaerobes are an uncommon cause. Fever and abdominal pain are the most common presenting symptoms. However, asymptomatic patients are being increasingly recognized. When SBP is suspected, paracentesis is indicated. An absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte count greater than 500/mm3 is highly suggestive of SBP. Ascitic fluid lactate and pH may offer additional diagnostic assistance when the PMN count is ambiguous. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initially based on the centrifuged Gram stain of ascites as well as the patient's renal function. Mortality is substantial and appears to be related to the severity of the underlying liver disease.\r"

The natural history of this disease in some sites appears to differ from that of small-cell lung cancer. One patient with small-cell carcinoma of the esophagus was treated with combination chemotherapy and survived for 1 year. Another patient had ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone production with small-cell carcinoma of the rectum. Two patients with small-cell bladder carcinoma are also reported in this series. Another patient with small-cell carcinoma in a cervical lymph node metastasis has survived more than 7 years after receiving radiation as the only modality of therapy. This case further substantiates the observations of others that extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma may pursue an indolent course. Furthermore, in certain sites, local modalities of therapy may result in long-term survival or cure. This is particularly true for small-cell neoplasms of the head and neck region. An association between smoking and extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma is postulated. The therapy and outcome of this disease is also discussed, with particular emphasis on the effectiveness of combined strategies of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the clinical features of 96 cases of amebic liver abscess and 48 of pyogenic hepatic abscess. Most patients with amebic abscess were young Hispanic males. Those with pyogenic abscess were older, without any ethnic predominance. Symptoms tended to be acute and localized to the right upper quadrant in amebic infection. In pyogenic disease, symptoms were often nonspecific and chronic in nature. A marked shift to the left of the leukocyte count occurred more frequently in pyogenic abscess, as did markedly abnormal values of the serum albumin, direct bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase. Sonography detected all cases of amebic abscess and missed the lesions in 2 of 39 patients with pyogenic abscess. Abscess cultures yielded pathogens in 90% of cases of pyogenic disease, while blood cultures were positive in 50%. Five of 20 patients with positive blood cultures had additional organisms isolated from the abscess that would have required adjustment of antibiotics for optimal coverage. We believe that all pyogenic abscesses should be aspirated to guide antibiotic therapy. In amebic abscess, the diagnosis was usually based on clinical and sonographic findings, aspiration being performed in only 14% of cases. Ninety-eight percent of patients were treated with amebicidal agents alone, and all responded to therapy. Therapeutic needle aspiration is rarely necessary. In pyogenic abscess, prolonged fever was common during medical therapy. Even in those eventually cured without surgery, the median time to defervescence was 8 days. Though 19 patients underwent surgical drainage, only 2 clearly did not benefit from medical treatment, having high fevers after more than 2 weeks on a regimen of appropriate antibiotics. Surgery is often performed prematurely because physicians expect fever to resolve quickly, but persistent fever of less than 2 weeks' duration should not constitute an indication for surgical drainage. Seven patients with pyogenic abscess died, 5 as a result of hepatic abscess. In 3 of these cases, the diagnosis was unsuspected till autopsy. Improved awareness of this disease may decrease morbidity and mortality from this treatable condition.\r"

We evaluated these measures in more than 5500 fetuses, including 28 who were later found to have Down's syndrome by means of amniocentesis with cytogenetic analysis. Normal femur length was established as a function of biparietal diameter in 192 of the normal fetuses. We found that with use of a nuchal skin-fold thickness of 6 mm or more and a ratio of actual to expected femur length of 0.91 or less, fetuses with Down's syndrome could be identified with a sensitivity of 75 percent and a specificity of 98 percent. When other anomalies, such as an atrioventricular canal and meconium peritonitis, were added to these two criteria, the sensitivity of sonographic detection of Down's syndrome in the second-trimester fetus rose to 82 percent. The potential predictive value of these sonographic signs far exceeds that of advanced maternal age and low alpha-fetoprotein levels, which currently identify only 10 to 30 percent of affected fetuses. We recommend that fetuses with a thickened nuchal skin fold or shortened femurs on ultrasound examination be evaluated for Down's syndrome by amniocentesis and cytogenetic analysis.\r"

Slutsky, M.D., resigned his appointments as a radiology resident (trainee) and nonsalaried associate clinical professor in the Department of Radiology at the University of California, San Diego. During the following year, faculty committees investigated Slutsky's entire bibliography of 137 articles published in seven years; 77 (including reviews) were classified as valid, 48 were judged questionable, and 12 were deemed fraudulent. The majority of these papers were published while Slutsky was a research or clinical trainee in cardiology, nuclear medicine, and then radiology. Our analysis of this case leads us to conclude that research fraud, although probably rare, in view of the size of the research establishment, may evade detection, and that there are scientists prepared to run the appreciable risk of submitting inaccurate statements for publication. Sophisticated dishonesty can escape detection by peer review and replication. The emphasis on competition and the pressure to produce, while intended to advance the discovery of truth, may foster a conflict between personal career goals and the intellectual motivation of scientists to seek the truth. The scientific community needs to address the issues raised by recent reports of fraud. Each institution and granting agency must have procedures for investigating suspected fraud or unethical practices, procedures that protect both the person who reports such practices and the accused person from premature disclosure. As we heighten awareness, we must avoid a \"witch hunt.\" Deterrence of research fraud is clearly needed, but institution of practices that might stifle originality or discourage cooperative research would be counterproductive.\r"

  ".W": "Propylthiouracil has been shown experimentally to protect against alcohol-induced hepatocellular necrosis in hypoxic conditions. An earlier, short-term study of patients with alcoholism and liver disease indicated clinical improvement with propylthiouracil, but the effect on mortality could not be assessed. In the present study, we investigated the effect of propylthiouracil on mortality in patients with alcoholic liver disease in a long-term, double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 310 compliant patients who received propylthiouracil (n = 157) or placebo (n = 153) for a maximum of two years. There were no differences between the two groups in demographic and clinical characteristics and biopsy-confirmed diagnoses at randomization, or in daily urinary alcohol levels during the study. The cumulative dropout rate over two years was not significantly different (propylthiouracil group, 0.68; placebo group, 0.60). The group receiving propylthiouracil (300 mg per day) had a cumulative mortality rate half that in the group receiving placebo (0.13 vs. 0.25 [P less than 0.05] in the total sample, and 0.25 vs. 0.55 [P less than 0.03] in a subgroup of severely ill patients [propylthiouracil group, n = 56; placebo group, n = 41]). Proportional-hazards stepwise regression analyses indicated that only propylthiouracil treatment, prothrombin time, hemoglobin levels, and mean daily urinary alcohol levels significantly affected mortality. The hazards ratio for the complete group indicated that mortality in the propylthiouracil group was 0.38 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.83) that of the placebo group. Protection by propylthiouracil was not observed in patients with high morning urinary alcohol levels. No clinically important side effects of propylthiouracil were observed at the dose used. We conclude that the administration of propylthiouracil can reduce mortality due to alcoholic liver disease.\r"

  ".U": "88065727\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1979 and 1984, 195 evaluable patients were entered in an international multicenter study comparing two regimens for patients with completely resected pathological Stage II testicular cancer (that is, with positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes). All patients had undergone orchiectomy and dissection of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. They were randomly assigned to be treated with two cycles of immediate adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy or to be observed monthly with treatment at relapse. The median follow-up period was four years. Of the 97 patients assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy, 6 (6 percent) had a recurrence; however, only 1 had received adjuvant chemotherapy before the recurrence. Three died (one of testicular cancer), and 94 of the 97 survived. Of the 98 patients who were observed, 48 (49 percent) had a relapse. However, almost all patients with relapses were effectively treated, and 93 of the 98 are alive and disease-free; 3 have died of testicular cancer. No identifiable factors were strongly associated with the risk of relapse. We conclude that two courses of cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy will almost always prevent relapse in pathological Stage II testicular cancer treated with orchiectomy and retroperitoneal-lymph-node dissection. However, when surgery, follow-up, and chemotherapy are optimal, observation with chemotherapy only for relapse will lead to equivalent cure rates.\r"

  ".W": "We looked for opioid peptides and their precursors in 108 tumors of both neuroendocrine and nonneuroendocrine origin, using a monoclonal \"pan-opioid\" antibody, 3-E7, which recognizes the tetrapeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe (the sequence responsible for pharmacologic activity in all known opioid peptides), in conjunction with polyclonal antibodies directed against representative peptides of each of the three precursors (alpha-endorphin, [met]enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu, and dynorphin B). Using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique, we observed consistent cytoplasmic immunoreactivity (at least focally) in all of 15 adrenal pheochromocytomas, all of 6 thyroid medullary carcinomas, and all of 5 pituitary adenomas. Opioid staining was also observed in parathyroid adenomas (8 of 9), pancreatic islet-cell tumors (7 of 10), carcinoid tumors from various sites (18 of 26), and paragangliomas (1 of 2). There was no immunoreactivity in pulmonary small-cell carcinomas, Merkel-cell tumors of skin, neuroblastomas, or any of the non-neuroendocrine tumors examined. The expression of alpha-endorphin, [met]enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu, and dynorphin B varied from tumor to tumor; however, positive staining with the \"pan-opioid\" antibody was found in each tumor containing at least one of the three precursors. Opioid peptide immunoreactivity was also detected in non-neoplastic cells of the adrenal medulla, pancreatic islets, pituitary, intestinal and bronchial mucosa, and intestinal myenteric plexuses. We conclude that opioid expression within tumors is most likely due to enhanced expression of a normal cell product and that opioid peptides are useful markers of neuroendocrine differentiation in many tumors.\r"

  ".U": "88065745\r", 
  ".W": "In September 1985, an outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 enteritis affected 55 of 169 residents and 18 of 137 staff members at a nursing home. The outbreak was characterized by two phases: a primary wave whose source was probably a contaminated sandwich meal and a secondary wave compatible with person-to-person transmission of infection. Among the elderly residents, the incubation period was 4 to 9 days (mean, 5.7 +/- 1.2). Older age and previous gastrectomy increased the risk of acquiring the infection (P = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). Antibiotic therapy during exposure was associated with acquiring a secondary infection (P = 0.001). Hemolytic uremic syndrome developed in 12 affected residents (22 percent), 11 of whom died. Overall, 19 (35 percent) of the affected residents died, 17 (31 percent) from causes attributable to their infection. Antibiotic therapy after the onset of symptoms was associated with a higher case fatality rate in the more severe cases, possibly because patients with more severe disease tended to be treated with antibiotics. There were no complications or deaths among the affected members of the staff. Evidence of infection by verotoxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 was detected in 30 of 70 cases on the basis of isolation of this organism or demonstration of free verotoxin in stools. All isolates belonged to the same phage type. The high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition emphasize the need for proper food hygiene, rapid identification of outbreaks of disease, and prompt institution of infection-control techniques among the institutionalized elderly.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that nocturnal hypoglycemia causes fasting hyperglycemia (the Somogyi phenomenon) in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, we studied 10 patients, who were on their usual therapeutic regimens, from 10 p.m. through 8 a.m. on three nights. On the first night, only a control procedure was performed (blood sampling only); on the second night, hypoglycemia was prevented (by intravenous glucose infusion, if necessary, to keep plasma glucose levels above 100 mg per deciliter [5.6 mmol per liter]); and on the third night, hypoglycemia was induced (by stepped intravenous insulin infusions between midnight and 4 a.m. to keep plasma glucose levels below 50 mg per deciliter [2.8 mmol per liter]). After nocturnal hypoglycemia was induced (36 +/- 2 mg per deciliter [2.0 +/- 0.1 mmol per liter] [mean +/- SE] from 2 to 4:30 a.m.), 8 a.m. plasma glucose concentrations (113 +/- 18 mg per deciliter [6.3 +/- 1.0 mmol per liter]) were not higher than values obtained after hypoglycemia was prevented (182 +/- 14 mg per deciliter [10.1 +/- 0.8 mmol per liter]) or those obtained after blood sampling only (149 +/- 20 mg per deciliter [8.3 +/- 1.1 mmol per liter]). Indeed, regression analysis of data obtained on the control night indicated that the 8 a.m. plasma glucose concentration was directly related to the nocturnal glucose nadir (r = 0.761, P = 0.011). None of the patients was awakened by hypoglycemia. Scores for symptoms of hypoglycemia, which were determined at 8 a.m., did not differ significantly among the three studies. We conclude that asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia does not appear to cause clinically important fasting hyperglycemia in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus on their usual therapeutic regimens.\r"

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of methylprednisolone therapy in 99 patients with refractory hypoxemia, diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography and absence of congestive heart failure documented by pulmonary-artery catheterization. The causes of ARDS included sepsis (27 percent), aspiration pneumonia (18 percent), pancreatitis (4 percent), shock (2 percent), fat emboli (1 percent), and miscellaneous causes or more than one cause (42 percent). Fifty patients received methylprednisolone (30 mg per kilogram of body weight every six hours for 24 hours), and 49 received placebo according to the same schedule. Serial measurements were made of pulmonary shunting, the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to partial pressure of alveolar oxygen, the chest radiograph severity score, total thoracic compliance, and pulmonary-artery pressure. We observed no statistical differences between groups in these characteristics upon entry or during the five days after entry. Forty-five days after entry there were no differences between the methylprednisolone and placebo groups in mortality (respectively, 30 of 50 [60 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 46 to 74] and 31 of 49 [63 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 49 to 77]; P = 0.74) or in the reversal of ARDS (18 of 50 [36 percent] vs. 19 of 49 [39 percent]; P = 0.77). However, the relatively wide confidence intervals in the mortality data make it impossible to exclude a small effect of treatment. Infectious complications were similar in the methylprednisolone group (8 of 50 [16 percent]) and the placebo group (5 of 49 [10 percent]; P = 0.60). Our data suggest that in patients with established ARDS due to sepsis, aspiration, or a mixed cause, high-dose methylprednisolone does not affect outcome.\r"

Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates (means +/- SE) of disease-free survival at five years among patients with ALL in second remission, third remission, and fourth remission or relapse were 64 +/- 9, 42 +/- 14, and 23 +/- 11 percent, respectively, with probabilities of relapse of 13 +/- 7, 25 +/- 13, and 64 +/- 16 percent. Among patients with AML in first remission, second remission, and third remission or relapse, five-year disease-free survival estimates were 66 +/- 10, 75 +/- 15, and 33 +/- 19 percent, with respective relapse probabilities of 0, 13 +/- 12, and 67 +/- 19 percent. The most frequent cause of death in patients in early remission (ALL in second or third remission or AML in first or second remission) was bacterial sepsis, fungal sepsis, or both, most often in the presence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. Among patients with ALL who received transplants while in second remission, the duration of the initial remission had no effect on the probability of relapse after transplantation. The only pretransplantation factor that significantly affected outcome was the disease status at the time of transplantation; patients in early remission had better disease-free survival. We conclude that transplantation after preparation with hyperfractionated total-body irradiation and cyclophosphamide is an effective mode of therapy in children with refractory forms of acute leukemia.\r"

The outcome was monitored by flexible proctosigmoidoscopic examinations and physicians' assessments at three-week intervals and by patients' recordings of daily symptoms. Results showed 24 percent complete and 50 percent partial responses in those receiving 4.8 g of 5-ASA per day as compared with 5 percent complete and 13 percent partial responses in those receiving placebo (P less than 0.0001, rank-sum test). At a dosage of 1.6 g per day, the response was twice as good as with placebo, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.51). Age, sex, duration of disease, duration of active symptoms, or extent of disease did not affect the clinical outcome. We conclude that oral 5-ASA administered in a dosage of 4.8 g per day is effective therapy, at least in the short term, for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.\r"

The immune response to these peptides is much lower than that to complete virus particles and the same sequence fused to the N terminus of beta-galactosidase did not produce a more potent immunogen than synthetic peptide alone. We report here an expression system for immunogenic epitopes linked to a carrier protein, hepatitis B core antigen, to form part of a virus-like complex which can present these epitopes to the immune system at high density. The immunogenicity of these structures approaches that of FMDV particles.\r"

Considerable functional as well as corresponding phenotypic heterogeneity exists within the two major T cell subsets. Although the CD8+ population contains pre-cytotoxic, cytotoxic, pre-suppressor and suppressor effector T cells, these distinctions still rest largely on the use of functional assays. Attempts have been made to define the CD8+ precursor of the killer cell with new monoclonal antibodies. But more precise phenotypic distinctions between the functional subpopulations within CD8+ cells will be needed. We have now developed a monoclonal antibody, anti-S6F1 which can distinguish killer effector and suppressor effector cells in CD8 lymphocyte populations. The cell-surface structure defined by this antibody comprises two glycoproteins with relative molecular mass (Mr) 180K and 95K respectively. Also sequential immunoprecipitation studies and two dimensional gel electrophoresis indicate that anti-S6F1 recognizes a novel epitope on the LFA-1 antigen.\r"

  ".U": "88065924\r", 
  ".W": "In the hippocampus, which is phylogenetically older than the cerebral neocortex, high frequency stimulation of afferent pathways leads to long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission. This use-dependent malleability is of considerable interest because it may serve as a substrate for memory processes. However, in the neocortex, whose involvement in learning is undisputed, attempts to demonstrate LTP have remained inconclusive. Here we use intracellular recording techniques to show that LTP can be induced by high frequency stimulation of the optic radiation in slices of the visual cortex of adult rats. We identify as a necessary prerequisite for the induction of LTP the activation of the membrane channel that is associated with the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor. Selective blockade of this receptor system with DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate consistently prevents LTP as in most hippocampal pathways. In most cortical neurons the activation of the NMDA mechanism and hence the induction of LTP in these experiments requires a concomitant reduction of GABAergic inhibition by low doses of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline. This indicates that in the neocortex the activation threshold of the NMDA-mechanism and consequently the susceptibility to LTP, are strongly influenced by inhibitory processes.\r"

After lesion, however, there is a dramatic increase in the amounts of both NGF-mRNA and NGF protein synthesized by the sciatic non-neuronal cells. This local increase in NGF synthesis partially replaces the interrupted NGF supply from the periphery to the NGF-responsive sensory and sympathetic neurons, whose axons run within the sciatic nerve. Macrophages, known to invade the site of nerve lesion during wallerian degeneration, are important in the regulation of NGF synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the effect of macrophages on NGF-mRNA levels in cultured explants of sciatic nerve can be mimicked by conditioned media of activated macrophages, and that interleukin-1 is the responsible agent.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial infection of the mammalian bloodstream can lead to overwhelming sepsis, a potentially fatal syndrome of irreversible cardiovascular collapse (shock) and critical organ failure. Cachectin, also known as tumour necrosis factor, is a macrophage-derived peptide hormone released in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and it has been implicated as a principal mediator of endotoxic shock, although its function in bacterial sepsis is not known. Anaesthetized baboons were passively immunized against endogenous cachectin and subsequently infused with an LD100 dose of live Escherichia coli. Control animals (not immunized against cachectin) developed hypotension followed by lethal renal and pulmonary failure. Neutralizing monoclonal anti-cachectin antibody fragments (F(ab')2) administered to baboons only one hour before bacterial challenge protected against shock, but did not prevent critical organ failure. Complete protection against shock, vital organ dysfunction, persistent stress hormone release and death was conferred by administration of antibodies 2 h before bacterial infusion. These results indicate that cachectin is a mediator of fatal bacteraemic shock, and suggest that antibodies against cachectin offer a potential therapy of life-threatening infection.\r"

We have now cloned the corresponding complementary DNA from a human-liver cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the overall structure of the cellular gene, which we have named hap, is similar to that of the DNA-binding hormone receptors. That is, it displays two highly conserved regions identified as the putative DNA-binding and hormone-binding domains of the c-erb A/steroid receptors. Six out of seven hepatoma and hepatoma-derived cell-lines express a 2.5-kilobase (kb) hap messenger RNA species which is undetectable in normal adult and fetal livers but present in all non-hepatic tissues analysed. The data suggest that the hap gene product may be a novel ligand-responsive regulatory protein whose inappropriate expression in liver may relate to the hepatocellular carcinogenesis.\r"

The activating regions that have been characterized are acidic, and mutational analysis of one indicates that this acidity is important for activity. Here we report the design of an artificial protein bearing a novel 15-amino acid peptide linked to a DNA binding fragment of the yeast regulatory protein GAL4). The synthetic peptide is acidic and should it form an alpha-helix, that helix would be amphipathic, having one hydrophilic face bearing the acidic residues, and one hydrophobic face. When expressed in yeast, the artificial protein bearing this peptide efficiently activates the GAL1 gene which is ordinarily activated by GAL4. An otherwise identical protein with the novel 15 amino acids in a scrambled order, and which is thus unable to form an amphipathic structure, does not activate GAL1 transcription.\r"

The 40 neural sheath tumors included 26 neurofibromas, 8 schwannomas, 4 malignant neural sheath tumors, 1 fibrosarcoma, and 1 meningioma. Nine of the neurofibromas were associated with von Recklinghausen's disease (VRD), and 2 others were what was termed regionalized neurofibromatosis characterized by involvement of one limb with extension along the course of one or more plexus elements. Seventeen tumors were not of neural sheath origin; 7 were benign and 10 were metastatic malignant tumors compressing or invading the plexus. Benign neurofibromas and malignant sheath tumors almost always presented with pain or functional neural deficit, whereas schwannomas often presented with a palpable mass as their only initial symptom. Patients with solitary neurofibromas were significantly older, often female, and more likely to have tumor on the right side than patients with schwannomas, malignant neural sheath tumors, or neurofibromas associated with VRD. Solitary neurofibromas could often be totally resected without added deficit by sacrificing fascicles entering and leaving tumor that were determined to be \"nonfunctional\" by intraoperative nerve action potential recordings. Resection of neurofibromas associated with VRD sometimes but not always resulted in significant loss. Operation is nonetheless recommended, especially when malignancy is suspected because of rapidly increasing size, when severe pain or neural deficit is present, or when compression of adjacent plexus elements is a concern. Schwannomas and benign non-neural sheath tumors can usually be extirpated without damage to plexus elements. Forequarter amputation is advised for malignant intrinsic tumors involving distal plexus elements even though gross total resection seems feasible.\r"

Intracranial heating during operation was performed in 4 patients. RF applicators with a cooling system were placed on the cerebral convexity and medial brain surface with the tumor between them. RF power was controlled to maintain the brain temperatures under 40 degrees C. Under this condition, the highest temperature of each tumor varied from 44 to 49 degrees C. After heating for about 60 minutes, 2 tumors showed regression on computed tomographic (CT) scans. Extracranial heating was performed in 12 patients with cerebral glioblastoma. RF applicators were placed on the lateral sides of the scalp and applied to diametrically opposite sides of the tumor. To avoid the influence of the skull on RF conduction, we performed a bilateral craniectomy slightly larger than the applicator at the initial operation. Heating was performed for approximately 60 minutes at each session and was repeated twice a week for a total of 4 to 10 times in combination with radiation and ACNU chemotherapy. No anesthetic agent was used during heating. Brain temperatures were maintained under 42 degrees C. The scalp under the applicators remained at 28-35 degrees C during heating, and no heat injury of the scalp was observed after repeated heating. The highest temperatures of the tumor or cavity after tumor removal were 45-46 degrees C in 3 cases, 43-44 degrees C in 3 cases, 42-43 degrees C in 4 cases, and 40-41 degrees C in 2 cases, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A prospective analysis of pregnancy outcome after ultrasound documentation of fetal viability at eight to 12 weeks' gestation was carried out in an uninstrumented population of patients to establish a background loss rate against which to evaluate the safety of chorionic villus sampling. All patients presenting to the authors' private practice from December 1983 to January 1986 were enrolled in the study. An ultrasound examination was performed at the first visit to confirm intrauterine pregnancy and assess gestational age; in gestations less than eight weeks, the sonogram was repeated four weeks later. Four hundred eighty-nine delivered patients are the subject of this study. We evaluated the differences between this group and those patients presenting either with a blighted ovum or beyond the first trimester, as well as the outcome of those patients with spotting early in gestation. This study suggests that if a live fetus is documented by ultrasonography at eight to 12 weeks' gestation, the risk of spontaneous abortion before 20 weeks' gestation in an uninstrumented population is 2.0%.\r"

Following wedge resection, the mean residual astigmatism was 3.04 D, with a range of 0 to 5.0 D. Although the mean keratometric astigmatism measurements were generally similar to the astigmatism measured during refraction, there was little correlation between them on a case-by-case basis.

Four cases were done under general anesthesia and in three there was straining and bucking at extubation. The most common presentation was sudden severe ocular pain one day postoperatively, associated with marked decrease in vision and low intraocular pressure. The prognosis was related to the extent of the hemorrhage; where suprachoroidal hemorrhage was extensive, surgical drainage appeared to help. Our last two patients, both with massive postoperative nonexpulsive suprachoroidal hemorrhage, underwent surgical drainage of suprachoroidal blood and recovered preoperative visual acuity.\r"

No patients ingested acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)-containing compounds before or during admission. Two patients of 24 treated with EACA and 1 of 25 given placebo had rebleeds. The hyphemas in the EACA-treated group took significantly longer to clear (mean, 5.3 versus 2.6 days; P less than 0.001). Because of the low incidence of rebleeds in the placebo group, the efficacy of EACA in reducing the rate of rebleeds could not be determined. Further studies with this drug, controlling for age, race, sickle trait, and pre-admission antiplatelet agents should be undertaken before its routine use in traumatic hyphema management can be recommended.\r"

The indications for the penetrating keratoplasty were photophobia, corneal edema, and loss of best-corrected vision after the astigmatic keratotomy procedures. Epithelial plugs were seen in all five specimens. Complete basal lamina lined the wounds in two cases. Tangential incisions of the Ruiz procedure were shallower and demonstrated more advanced wound healing than the corresponding semiradial incisions. Two of the three Ruiz procedures demonstrated peripheral separation of the semiradial incisions. Wound healing events after astigmatic keratotomy procedures appear similar to those reported previously after standard radial keratotomy with the exception that tangential incisions appear to heal faster than the semiradial incisions.\r"

The interaction of numerous local ocular and systemic factors played a fundamental role in causing disease. The authors found significant association between S. pneumoniae and topical steroid use, and direct and indirect linkage of S. aureus with diabetes and trauma, respectively. S. pneumoniae and Moraxella were risk factors for major complications (24% of cases); S. pneumoniae was related to enucleation and late perforation. Corneal exposure and prior topical steroids were associated with prolonged hospital stays. Hypopyon was associated with pneumococcal infection, 60 years of age or older, and trauma. The identification of groups at high-risk for microbial keratitis and problems of preventive management are discussed.\r"

The elderly consume a share of the nation's health care that is disproportionate to their numbers. In 1984, per capita health care spending for the elderly was four times that for the rest of the population. Ophthalmic expenses form a significant portion of their health care spending. Increasing numbers of elderly and per capita spending have placed enormous pressure on Medicare. In recent years, changing patterns of ophthalmic care have influenced the size and direction of Medicare expenditures; for example, new technologies in cataract surgery have shifted services from inpatient to outpatient settings. Such shifting of costs and other program changes must be analyzed to determine the impact on future Medicare expenditures and beneficiaries.\r"

Screening for significant refractive errors in preverbal children is more difficult; however, the red reflex test of Bruckner is useful for the detection of anisometropic refractive errors. The photorefraction test, which is an adaptation of Bruckner's red reflex test, may prove to be a useful screening device for detecting bilateral as well as unilateral refractive errors.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic liver disease in the pediatric age group, even in young infants.

Symptoms in patient 1 developed after fundoplication, generalized autonomic dysfunction occurred in patient 2, and dumping syndrome developed in patient 3 after malplacement of a feeding gastrostomy tube. Average blood glucose levels studied during and after two to seven meals in each child were 375 +/- 97 mg/dL (mean +/- SD) 30 minutes postprandially and 35 +/- 10 mg/dL greater than 120 minutes later. Swings in glucose values were proportional to the volume of meals. Insulin and glucagon levels were followed during a single meal challenge test in each patient; the average glucose concentration increased to 356 +/- 59 mg/dL 30 minutes postprandially and decreased to 32 +/- 11 mg/dL at 150 +/- 30 minutes. Hormonal analyses indicated (1) inappropriate early release of glucagon (300 pg/mL at 15 minutes) in patient 1, (2) exuberant early release of insulin (maximum 190 +/- 15 microU/mL) resulting in rapid decrease in glucose concentration in all patients, (3) development and/or persistence of hypoglycemia after the decline in circulating insulin to undetectable levels, and (4) inadequate glucagon response to hypoglycemia resulting in sustained hypoglycemia. These data indicate that gross disturbances of the insulin-glucagon axis attend childhood dumping syndrome.\r"

The supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus produces the ADH and the neurohypophysis stores and releases it. Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus sense minute changes in the extracellular osmolality and stimulate or inhibit ADH synthesis and secretion. At the same time the thirst center of the hypothalamus is stimulated by the extracellular osmolality and brings conscious awareness of thirst into play. Once ADH is secreted, its target organ is the kidney, specifically the collecting ducts and distal tubules. Blood volume, blood pressure, emotional input, medications, and various pathologic conditions also affect ADH synthesis and secretion. As with any complex system there are numerous opportunities for a breakdown to occur. The most common types of pathologic conditions are the various forms of DI and SIADH. Both of these disorders have numerous causes, which must be identified prior to effective treatment. Serum and urine osmolality and sodium content are of use in diagnosing the disorders. Treatment is then geared toward correcting the underlying problem and controlling water balance, usually through pharmacologic agents. Nursing care includes meeting both the physical and psychologic needs of patients and educating them in the process of living with their transient or permanent condition.\r"

Acutely, the rapidity of onset of renal deterioration makes nursing assessment and intervention critical to the prevention of complications and potentially fatal outcomes. For patients with chronic renal failure, nursing assessment and intervention are equally significant, since there is an absence of renal regulatory mechanisms. In renal failure, acute or chronic, one most commonly sees patients who have a tendency to develop hypervolemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and bicarbonate deficiency (metabolic acidosis). Sodium is generally retained, but may appear normal, or hyponatremic, because of dilution from fluid retention. Following the relief of a urinary tract obstruction, hypovolemia, hyponatremia (true loss of sodium), hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and bicarbonate loss are most apt to occur. Electrolyte imbalances after urinary diversion vary depending on the site of urine diversion.\r"

Additional reasons for implementation relate to activities supporting or evaluating nursing care. Consistency of the nursing focus is important in both direct and indirect care activities. As nursing diagnosis-based planning of care is implemented, consideration has to be given to the use of diagnosis-based documentation systems, quality assurance programs, staffing, and other support or evaluative activities. Great progress has been made in the classification of nursing diagnoses since the 1970s but much still remains to be done. The role of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association in this work has been briefly summarized.\r"

  ".W": "The pathway of renin biosynthesis and secretion in normal and ischemic human kidneys has been investigated by pulse-labeling experiments. The results indicate that in normal human kidney, preprorenin is rapidly processed to 47-kDa prorenin. Microradiosequencing showed that this molecule was generated by cleavage between Gly-23 and Leu-24, yielding a 43-amino acid proregion. Analysis of prorenin secreted by the kidney tissue yielded an identical sequence, indicating that prorenin is secreted without any further proteolysis. An examination of the kinetics of processing and secretion suggested that a majority of the newly synthesized prorenin is quickly secreted, while only a small fraction is processed intracellularly to the mature renin. The differences in secretion kinetics between prorenin and mature renin and the selective inhibition of prorenin secretion by monensin suggest that they are secreted independently via two pathways: a constitutive pathway probably from the Golgi or protogranules that rapidly release prorenin and a regulated pathway that secretes mature renin from the mature granules. A comparison of the kinetics of processing between normal and ischemic tissues suggests that renal ischemia leads to an overall increase in the rate of processing of prorenin to mature renin. In addition, prolonged biosynthetic labeling of renin in the ischemic kidney yielded two smaller molecular weight immunoreactive forms suggestive of renin fragments that may be degradative products. These fragments were not detected in normal kidney tissue labeled for similar lengths of time.\r"

The entrapped or free DNA was injected intraperitoneally into immunodeficient (nude) BALB/c mice bearing ascites tumor generated by H-2Kk-positive RDM-4 lymphoma cells. About 20% of the injected immunoliposomes were taken up by the target RDM-4 cells. Uptake was much less when liposomes without antibody were used. The presence of the targeting antibody on liposomes also significantly decreased the nonspecific uptake of liposomes by the spleen. Significant CAT enzyme activity was detected in RDM-4 cells from mice treated with DNA entrapped in the pH-sensitive immunoliposomes. Furthermore, CAT expression in RDM-4 cells was under the control of cAMP, as only the cells from mice injected with 8-bromo-cAMP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine showed CAT activity. CAT activity in liver and spleen was much lower (by factors of 12 and 5, respectively) than in the RDM-4 cells, and the activities in these reticuloendothelial organs were not regulated by cAMP. CAT activity in RDM-4 cells from mice injected with DNA entrapped in pH-insensitive immunoliposomes (containing phosphatidylcholine in place of phosphatidylethanolamine) was approximately one-fourth that in RDM-4 cells from mice injected with pH-sensitive immunoliposomes, indicating the superior delivery efficiency of the pH-sensitive liposomes. These results are discussed in terms of the DNA-carrier potential of immunoliposomes in therapy of cancer and genetic diseases.\r"

The protein that recognizes this sequence is not known but is likely to be the Tn10-encoded transposase protein. We present evidence that the 5-methyl groups of the two thymines in this sequence are essential for efficient transposon insertion; in their absence the sequence is still recognized, but at lower efficiency. We have reached this conclusion by examination of a specific hot spot whose sequence is 5' GCCAGGC 3'. The innermost cytosines of this sequence happen to be substrates for methylation at their 5 positions by the bacterial dcm-encoded methylase. We find that Tn10 transposes into this site 15 times more frequently in a Dcm+ host than in a Dcm- host; in the Dcm- host, insertions still occur, but at a low frequency. Thus, at this site, the absence of pyrimidine 5-methyl groups at the third positions of the consensus sequence is sufficient to convert a strong insertion hot spot into a weaker but still recognizable hot spot. This observation supports the general proposition, suggested previously by comparisons among consensus sequences, that the presence or absence of these 5-methyl groups is one major feature that can make the difference between a strong and a weak Tn10 insertion hot spot.\r"

Order-of-function analysis indicated that the cold-sensitive defect blocked cells during reentry before start of the first mitotic cell cycle.

When the injection was performed at E4 or E5, the number of heart tumors declined, whereas the number of skin muscle tumors increased significantly. The p110gag-myc protein was found in all tumors analyzed. When the virus was injected intravenously into E10 embryos, no tumors appeared during embryonic life, in striking contrast to the results obtained from injections at earlier stages. The monoclonal antibody 13F4, which is specific for the myogenic lineage, bound strongly to tumoral heart tissue, whereas it bound weakly to normal cardiac cells. Comparison of the peaks of tumor incidence in relationship to the timing of injection suggests that the v-myc product could interfere in vivo with an early step of the muscle lineage differentiation program. In addition, we show that the p58c-myc protein, which is supposed to play an important role in the control of cell proliferation, is only faintly detected in the heart of normal E3 embryos, in contrast to limb and tail buds, which readily express detectable levels of p58c-myc.\r"

A computer simulation of the theoretical model that calculates the mobility of large DNA molecules as a function of agarose pore size, DNA chain properties, and electric field conditions has been used to generate mobility curves for DNA molecules in the size range of the larger yeast chromosomes. Pulsed-field electrophoresis experiments resulting in the establishment of an electrophoretic karyotype for yeast, where the mobility of the DNA fragments is a monotonic function of molecular size for the entire size range that is resolved (200-2200 kilobase pairs), has been compared to the theoretical mobility curves generated by the computer model. The various physical mechanisms and experimental conditions responsible for band inversion and improved electrophoretic separation are identified and discussed in the framework of the model.\r"

In this study, we show that mutant Alar6, when grown under conditions of repression, has an A system of amino acid transport activity similar to that of the derepressed parental cell line, CHO-K1 (wild type) and of the fully constitutive mutant in gene R1, Alar4. However, the A system of Alar6 is further derepressible. The Vmax for proline transport through this system in mutant Alar6 is four times that of the parental culture, with no significant change in Km. Analysis of hybrids produced by crossing mutant Alar6 with the parental culture and with Alar4 shows that mutant Alar6 is recessive to wild type and complements mutant Alar4. Although the amino acid transport A system of CHO-K1 is stimulated by insulin, mutant alar6 is not stimulated by insulin. These results support the hypothesis that mutant alar6 results from mutation in another regulatory gene, R2, that, in conjunction with gene R1, negatively controls the expression of a structural gene for the A-system transport. Evidence also indicates that R2 gene product is not responsive to amino acids and that insulin stimulation of the A system may result from insulin inactivation of this repressor.\r"

  ".W": "The insertion sequence IS903 has perfect, 18-base-pair terminal repeats that are the presumed binding sites of its transposase. We have isolated mutations throughout this inverted repeat and analyzed their effect on transposition. We show that every position in the inverted repeat (with the possible exception of position 4) is important for efficient transposition. Furthermore, various substitutions at a single position can have a wide range of effects. Analysis of these hierarchical effects suggests that transposase contacts the minor groove in the region from position 13 to position 16 but makes major groove (or more complex) interactions with the outer portion of the inverted repeat. Our data indicate that the transposase exhibits relaxed specificity for the \"second\" end of a transposed segment; the defect in transposition of virtually all mutant inverted repeats can be rescued by a wild-type end. However, this rescue exhibits a pronounced position effect; in most cases, it is efficient only when the wild-type end is close to the 3' end of the transposase gene. This confirms the cis-acting nature of the transposase protein and suggests the initial transposase-inverted repeat interaction is the rate-limiting step in transposition. From the behavior of transposons with one mutant and one wild-type end, we infer that the inverted repeat contains two functional domains--one for initial complex formation with transposase and the other for effective completion of transpositional recombination. To support this hypothesis we show that an end with a mutation in one domain can significantly rescue an end with a mutation in the other domain.\r"

The disulfide bridge constraints have been designed on the basis of conformational studies on SP and physalaemin indicating an alpha-helical structure for the core of these two tachykinins (group I) and a folding of the C-terminal carboxamide towards the side chains of the glutamines 5 and 6 (group II). Only peptides simulating the alpha-helix present substantial potencies. [Cys3,6]SP is as active as SP in inhibiting 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter SP-specific binding on rat brain synaptosomes and on dog carotid bioassay, two assays specific for the neurokinin 1 receptor. Moreover, [Cys3,6]SP is as potent as neurokinin B in inhibiting 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter eledoisin-specific binding on rat cortical synaptosomes as well as in stimulating rat portal vein, two tests specific for the neurokinin 3 receptor. Interestingly, in contrast to neurokinin B, [Cys3,6]SP is a weak agonist of the neurokinin 2 receptor subtype, as evidenced by its binding potency in inhibiting 3H-labeled neurokinin A-specific binding on rat duodenum and in inducing the contractions of the rabbit pulmonary artery, a neurokinin 2-type bioassay. To increase the specificity of the cyclic analogue [Cys3,6]SP positions 8 and 9 were modified. [Cys3,6, Tyr8, Ala9]SP is slightly less selective than SP for the neurokinin 1 receptor subtype. [Cys2,5]neurokinin B constitutes a selective cyclic agonist for the neurokinin 3 receptor. The very weak potencies of the peptides from group II indicate that a certain degree of flexibility in the C-terminal moiety is required. Collectively, these results suggest that the neurokinin 1 and neurokinin 3 tachykinin receptors may recognize a similar three-dimensional structure of the core of the tachykinins. Different orientations of the common C-terminal tripeptide may be related to the selectivity for the different receptor subtypes.\r"

  ".W": "The oxidant H2O2 has many insulin-like effects in rat adipocytes. To determine whether these effects could be mediated by the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor, the ability of H2O2 to stimulate receptor phosphorylation in intact adipocytes and partially purified insulin receptors has been examined. Phosphorylation of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor was increased approximately 2-fold by treatment of intact cells with 3 mM H2O2, a concentration that maximally stimulates 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Stimulation of receptor phosphorylation was rapid, reaching maximal levels within 5 min, and preceded activation of glucose transport. Phosphoamino acid analysis of insulin receptors from H2O2-treated adipocytes showed that 32P incorporation into phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues of the beta subunit was enhanced. Furthermore, partially purified receptors from H2O2-treated cells exhibit increased tyrosine kinase activity, as measured by phosphorylation of the peptide Glu80Tyr20. In contrast, the direct addition of H2O2 to partially purified insulin receptors did not stimulate tyrosine kinase activity or insulin receptor autophosphorylation. This was not due to breakdown of H2O2 or oxidation of ATP or the required divalent cations. To define the factors involved in H2O2's effect, we have examined receptor phosphorylation in fat cell homogenates and purified plasma membranes. Although insulin stimulated receptor phosphorylation in both of these systems, H2O2 was only effective in the cell homogenates. These data demonstrate that, under certain conditions, H2O2 stimulates insulin receptor phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting that the insulin-like effects of H2O2 may be mediated by stimulation of insulin receptor phosphorylation. This does not appear to be a direct effect of H2O2 on the insulin receptor and requires nonplasma membrane cellular constituents.\r"

Castanospermine is shown to inhibit syncytium formation induced by the envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus and to inhibit viral replication. The decrease in syncytium formation in the presence of castanospermine can be attributed to inhibition of processing of the envelope precursor protein gp160, with resultant decreased cell surface expression of the mature envelope glycoprotein gp120. In addition, castanospermine may cause defects in steps involved in membrane fusion after binding of CD4 antigen. The antiviral effects of castanospermine may be due to modifications of the envelope glycoprotein that affect the ability of the virus to enter cells after attachment to the CD4 cell receptor.\r"

To study the interrelationship between various c-abl transcripts and to compare their sequence with the v-abl transcript, we prepared c-abl-specific cDNA clones from mouse testis and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the 4.0-kb cDNA that appears to be the reverse transcript of the testis-specific mRNA. In addition, we have determined the 3' sequence of an additional clone derived from the larger mRNA species that is expressed in somatic as well as germ-line cells. These cDNA sequences have been compared with the v-abl sequences to understand the mechanism of activation of this oncogene. The results demonstrate that (i) testis-specific c-abl mRNAs arise as a result of 3' truncation, and (ii) the v-abl gene has arisen from its cellular homologue as a result of an extensive deletional/mutational process.\r"

Among these mixtures, a combination of two sets of partially complementary oligomers were able to hybridize to all the tested sequences. To identify members of the ras superfamily, we screened a rat brain cDNA library with these probes and isolated four genes, denoted rab1, -2, -3, and -4, encoding proteins homologous to the yeast YPT protein. Amino acid homology scores with YPT range from 75% for rab1 to 37% for rab4, whereas the homologies with p21 ras and other ras-related proteins are approximately equal to 30%, and homologous residues were clustered in the regions involved in GTP/GDP binding. Another striking similarity shared by the rab and the other ras-related proteins is the conservation of at least one cysteine residue near the carboxyl-terminal end involved in the membrane binding of the ras proteins. rab1 is a mammalian homolog of the yeast YPT gene, and the four rab genes constitute an additional branch of the ras gene superfamily that to our knowledge has not been described in higher eukaryotes.\r"

DNase I \"footprinting\" analysis showed that the transposase protects an inner 25-base-pair region of the 38-base-pair terminal inverted repeat sequence of Tn3. This protection is not dependent on pH. Interestingly, binding of the transposase to the inverted repeat sequences facilitates DNase I to nick at the end of the Tn3 sequence. It was also observed that the transposase protects the end regions of restriction fragments with a cohesive sequence at their 5' end or with a flush end from DNase I cleavage.

E. coli strains that are defective for phosphoglucose isomerase (strain DF40) alone or phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (strain DF2000) accumulate Glc-6-P when grown in gluconate minimal medium in the presence of glucose. These strains and the control strain K10 were transformed with pAM006, a plasmid that carries the genes for ampicillin resistance and beta-galactosidase production, and grown for 24 hr under conditions that prompted the accumulation of Glc-6-P. An increase in plasmid mutations was observed (7- and 13-fold) that was associated with the increased intracellular levels of Glc-6-P (20- and 30-fold) present in the DF40 and DF2000 E. coli strains, respectively. Growth of the mutant bacteria in gluconate minimal medium does not increase the intracellular levels of Glc-6-P or the rate of plasmid mutations over background. Further characterization of the mutated plasmid DNA showed that insertions, deletions, and point mutations were responsible for the loss of beta-galactosidase production. The increase in plasmid mutations as a function of increased intracellular Glc-6-P levels suggests that the accumulation of adducts formed by Glc-6-P and other reducing sugars may contribute to DNA damage.\r"

  ".W": "Matrix Gla protein (MGP), a low molecular weight protein found in bone, dentin, and cartilage, contains 5 residues of the vitamin K-dependent amino acid gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). We have used antibodies raised against MGP and oligonucleotide probes to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from the rat osteosarcoma cells (line ROS 17/2) that had been pretreated with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. By sequencing several cloned cDNAs, we established a 523-base-pair sequence that predicts an 84-residue mature MGP and a 19-residue hydrophobic signal peptide. The 84-residue mature rat MGP predicted from the cDNA sequence has an additional 5 residues at its C terminus (-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Lys) not seen in the sequence of MGP isolated from bovine bone. The structure of rat MGP provides insight into the mechanisms by which the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase recognizes substrate. The present studies show that MGP, unlike other vitamin K-dependent proteins, lacks a propeptide. The absence of an MGP propeptide demonstrates that gamma-carboxylation and secretion of vitamin K-dependent proteins need not be linked to the presence of a propeptide or to its proteolytic removal. The propeptides of other vitamin K-dependent proteins are structurally homologous, and there is evidence that this homologous propeptide domain is important to substrate recognition by the gamma-carboxylase. Mature MGP has a sequence segment (residues 15-30) that is homologous to the propeptide of other vitamin K-dependent proteins and probably serves the same role in gamma-carboxylase recognition. Rat MGP also has a second sequence that has recently been identified in all known vitamin K-dependent vertebrate proteins, the invariant unit Glu-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Glu-Xaa-Cys (EXXXEXC). Since the glutamic residues in this unit are sites of gamma-carboxylation, it has been suggested that the EXXXEXC unit could allow the gamma-carboxylase to discriminate between substrate and product. The demonstration that two structures common to vitamin K-dependent proteins, the homologous propeptides domain and the invariant EXXXEXC unit, are in mature MGP indicates that des-gamma-carboxy-MGP should be an excellent in vitro gamma-carboxylase substrate for analysis of mechanisms involved in substrate recognition and product dissociation.\r"

The deduced DHFR-TS protein contained 608 amino acids (71,682 Da). The coding region for DHFR-TS contained no intervening sequences and had a high A + T content (75%). The DHFR domain, in the amino-terminal portion of the protein, was joined by a 94-amino acid junction sequence to the TS domain in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein. The TS domain was more conserved than the DHFR domain and both P. falciparum domains were more homologous to eukaryotic than to prokaryotic forms of the enzymes. Predicted secondary structures of the DHFR and TS domains were nearly identical to the structures identified in other DHFR and TS enzymes.\r"

In contrast, the expression of non-HS genes in extracts from heat-induced cells is only 40% of that seen in extracts from cells at 33 degrees C. These results correlate well with the levels of HS sigma factor and normal sigma factor bound to RNA polymerase. Thus, there was an 8-fold increase in the HS sigma factor and a 60% decrease in the normal sigma factor associated with RNA polymerase at the higher temperature. Part of the increase in the level of the HS sigma factor could be accounted for by a 3-fold increase in the level of HS sigma factor mRNA during heat induction.\r"

  ".U": "88068605\r", 
  ".W": "A two-step culture system has been developed to analyze the role of hormones in casein accumulation by mammary epithelial cells obtained from adrenalectomized and ovariectomized adult virgin mice. In the first step cells are grown inside collagen gel in medium containing insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and linoleic acid for 9 days; these conditions stimulate very little casein accumulation. Following this growth phase the gels are released to float in medium containing insulin, prolactin, and linoleic acid. During this second phase the mammary cells will accumulate large amounts of casein, but only in the simultaneous presence of insulin, prolactin, and linoleic acid; in the absence of linoleic acid casein accumulation is greatly reduced. The casein accumulation is not dependent on the presence of the glucocorticoid cortisol and will occur in spite of the presence of the antiglucocorticoid agent RU 38 486. To determine if the response to cortisol observed in organ culture by other investigators might be mediated by stromal cells, epithelial cells were grown in collagen gel under fatty acid-free conditions and then cocultured with explants of mammary fat pads from adult virgin mice with or without mammary parenchyma. The cocultures were performed in fatty acid-free medium containing insulin and prolactin with or without cortisol. In the majority of experiments the mammary epithelial cells in the collagen gel accumulate more casein in the presence of cortisol than in its absence, irrespective of the presence of mammary parenchyma in the explant. Thus, mammary epithelial cells are directly dependent on insulin and prolactin for casein accumulation and indirectly dependent on cortisol by means of its effect on the stromal cells. This cortisol effect may be to cause release into the medium of linoleic acid or a metabolic product of linoleic acid from the stromal cells.\r"

Introduction of the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cDNA clone into a vector based on the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus allowed efficient transfer and expression of GM-CSF in factor-dependent myeloid cell lines (FDC-P1 and FDC-P2). Factor-independent growth was acquired when the vector was introduced into the GM-CSF-responsive FDC-P1 cell line but not the multi-CSF-dependent FDC-P2 line. Nonlinear clonability in the absence of exogenous growth factor and growth inhibition by GM-CSF antiserum support a model of autocrine stimulation that requires interaction of factor and receptor at the outer membrane. However, many, but not all, infected FDC-P1 cells acquired subsequently a second mutation that abrogated the requirement of GM-CSF secretion and external interaction. The nature of the second step, which presumably leads to tumorigenicity of these cells, is not well understood, but its frequency could be correlated with the level of GM-CSF released by an individual cell clone.\r"

Using antibody directed against the Sec53 protein, we found that a substantial portion of the Sec53 protein is associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Membrane-bound Sec53 protein is largely insoluble in Triton X-100, but the protein is effectively released from the membrane by urea. We propose that the Sec53 protein may be a member of a complex of proteins required for an early step in protein processing and transport.\r"

Unexpectedly, significant variations in the amounts of EBV DNA per cell were observed between individual cells of these lines.

Results described here demonstrate that the bryostatins may also be useful as stimulators of normal human hematopoietic cells since they can (i) directly stimulate bone marrow progenitor cells to form colonies in vitro and (ii) functionally activate neutrophils. Structure-activity studies with bryostatin congeners indicate that these stimulatory properties may be dependent on the chain length and the unsaturated nature of the acylated group at carbons 20 and 7 of the bryostatin molecule. These stimulatory properties demonstrate that the naturally occurring bryostatins can mimic many of the biological effects of multipotential granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Thus, the coupling of antineoplastic activity with stimulatory growth properties for normal hematopoietic cells makes this agent an excellent probe to dissect the mechanism(s) of normal hematopoiesis. In addition, bryostatin may represent a clinically attractive agent useful for treating bone marrow failure states.\r"

In the present study, RNA blot analyses and immunohistochemical studies were performed on rat tissues obtained from a variety of prenatal and postnatal stages to examine the expression of the neu oncogene and its product, p185, during normal development. Expression of the neu gene was detected in mid-gestation embryos in a variety of tissues including nervous system, connective tissue, and secretory epithelium, but not in lymphoid tissue. In adult animals, secretory epithelial tissues and basal cells of the skin expressed neu. These studies demonstrate that the neu gene is expressed in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. We suggest that the p185 molecule plays an important role in the growth and development of a variety of tissues, and, in particular, in epithelial tissue.\r"

Transfected cells in culture expressing the Ca2+-dependent L-CAM showed uniform surface expression of the molecule. Unlike untransfected L cells, these cells aggregated readily; the aggregation was inhibited by Fab' fragments of antibodies to L-CAM but not by fragments of anti-N-CAM. These cells spread more efficiently in culture than did their untransfected counterparts, forming small colonies of flattened cells that gradually assumed morphologies resembling closely packed L cells. Transfected L cells expressing either the small or large intercellular domain polypeptide (sd or ld) chains of N-CAM aggregated specifically with each other or bound membrane vesicles from chick brain. Both types of binding were specifically inhibited by Fab' fragments of anti-N-CAM antibodies. These cells, in contrast to those transfected with vectors for L-CAM, showed rounded morphologies and spread inefficiently in culture. L cells transfected with vectors specifying the small surface domain polypeptide (ssd) chain of N-CAM showed no phenotypic changes and no evidence for linkage of ssd chains to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol intermediates. Instead, these cells synthesized the molecule and released it into the medium. These findings complete the demonstration that different CAMs have specific roles in ligating the cells that synthesize them, and they provide further evidence that L-CAM and N-CAM bind by homophilic mechanisms. The different phenotypic changes observed for each specific CAM are consistent with the hypothesis that CAM synthesis or differing associations of CAM carboxyl-terminal domains with the cell surface and cortex may lead directly or indirectly to specific alterations in the cells bound together by that CAM.\r"

We have mapped two sites to the nontranscribed region of the element upstream of the transcription start site that are required for maximal gene expression and are similar to sites previously defined in other genes. One, the TATA site, is located 74 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site and has the canonical sequence TATAAAA. This site is required for normal rates of initiation; deletion of the site greatly reduces the amount of Ty917 mRNA without changing its 5' end. A second site is located in a region from 140 to 110 base pairs upstream of the start site. Unlike other upstream activation site (UAS) elements previously defined, the Ty917 UAS is not sufficient to promote any transcription in the absence of downstream transcription regulatory sites. Thus the UAS is necessary but not sufficient for maximal transcription. Comparison of constructs lacking either the UAS or the downstream enhancer or both shows evidence of synergistic interaction between the sites since the effect of the sites on the rate of transcription initiation is more than additive.\r"

Several transmembrane segments within MalF can act as signal sequences in exporting alkaline phosphatase. Other transmembrane sequences, in conjunction with cytoplasmic domains, can stably anchor alkaline phosphatase in the cytoplasm. Our results suggest that features of the amino acid sequence (possibly the positively charged amino acids) of the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins are important in anchoring these domains in the cytoplasm. These studies in conjunction with our earlier results show that alkaline phosphatase fusions to membrane proteins can be an important aid in analyzing membrane topology and its determinants.\r"

The site is, at most, 34 base pairs and contains a perfect 13-base-pair inverted repeat. Site-directed mutations were made within the repeat sequence that abolished activity whether or not the symmetry of the palindrome was maintained. Partition appears to be a competitive process, as differentially marked plasmids carrying the same type of partition site are not independently segregated but are randomly distributed with respect to each other. We have studied competition between plasmids carrying various fragments encompassing the parS site. As expected, two plasmids carrying the minimal parS site compete with each other. However, a sequence that lies to the left of the minimal parS site acts as a major modulator of this competition, changing the specificity of the competitive effect completely. Thus, this adjacent sequence appears to be an important determinant of the specificity of the wild-type P1 partition system without being necessary for its efficient function.\r"

Both activated ras genes partially complemented the regulatory defect in RJ2.2.5 and specifically increased the expression of the DR and DQ subsets of HLA class II genes. Blot-hybridization analysis and RNase mapping indicated that HLA-DQ alpha-chain mRNA in the infected cell lines was increased to a level at least 50% that of the parent B-cell line, Raji. The levels of HLA-DR and -DQ beta-chain RNA also were increased but to a lesser extent. In contrast, we detected no effect of ras on the quantities of other class II, class I, or invariant-chain mRNAs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with antibodies recognizing HLA-DR, -DQ, and class I antigens supported these observations. Enhancement of HLA class II gene expression by ras genes may have important implications for regulation of the immune system in response to transformation.\r"

Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA showed the patient carried a homozygous mutation inherited from his parents. When compared with normal human aldolase A, the patient's enzyme from erythrocytes and from cultured lymphoblastoid cells was found to be highly thermolabile, suggesting that this mutation causes a functional defect of the enzyme. To further examine this possibility, the thermal stability of aldolase A of the patient and of a normal control, expressed in Escherichia coli using expression plasmids, was determined. The results of E. coli expression of the mutated aldolase A enzyme confirmed the thermolabile nature of the abnormal enzyme. The Asp-128 is conserved in aldolase A, B, and C of eukaryotes, including an insect, Drosophila, suggesting that the Asp-128 of the aldolase A protein is likely to be an amino acid residue with a crucial role in maintaining the correct spatial structure or in performing the catalytic function of the enzyme.\r"

We describe a peptide, of calculated molecular mass 3905 Da, that was a major protein component of amyloid-rich pancreatic extracts of three type 2 diabetic patients. After collagenase treatment, an extract containing 20-50% amyloid was solubilized by sonication into 70% formic acid and the peptide was purified by gel filtration followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. We term this peptide diabetes-associated peptide, as it was not detected in extracts of pancreas from any of six normal subjects. Diabetes-associated peptide contains 37 amino acids and is 46% identical to the sequences of rat and human calcitonin gene-related peptide, indicating that these peptides are related in evolution. Sequence identities with conserved residues of the insulin A chain were also seen in a 16-residue segment. On extraction, the islet amyloid is particulate and insoluble like the core particles of Alzheimer disease. Their monomers have similar molecular masses, each having a hydropathic region that can probably form beta-pleated sheets. The accumulation of amyloid, including diabetes-associated peptide, in islets may impair islet function in type 2 diabetes mellitus.\r"

Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against cytokeratin and the 17-1A epithelial antigen we identified immunocytochemically tumor cells in bone marrow of patients with breast cancer (n = 155) and colorectal cancer (n = 57) at the time of surgery of the primary tumor. Monoclonal antibody CK2, recognizing the human cytokeratin component 18 in simple epithelia, appeared to be the most suitable reagent because of its negative reaction with bone marrow samples of the noncarcinoma patients (n = 75). Its specificity was further demonstrated in a double-marker staining procedure using an anti-leukocyte common antigen monoclonal antibody (T200) as counterstain. A comparative analysis showed that immunocytology was clearly superior to conventional cytology (n = 212) and histology (n = 39). In 9.5-20.5% of patients without distant metastasis, tumor cells could be detected in bone marrow. We found a significant correlation between tumor cells in bone marrow and conventional risk factors, such as distant metastasis or lymph node involvement. In a first approach toward immunotherapy we demonstrated in 3 patients that infused monoclonal antibody 17-1A can label single tumor cells in bone marrow in vivo. We then used this approach to follow up 7 patients undergoing 17-1A therapy in an adjuvant clinical trial.\r"

The mry::Tn916 mutation causes a reduction by a factor of approximately equal to 50 in the amount of M protein produced, in the original strain and in a nonmutagenized host to which the mutation was transferred by transduction. The insertion is located approximately 1.8 kilobases upstream of the structural gene for M protein (emm) and its promoter. The genomic region including mry::Tn916 and emm was cloned on a cosmid vector and introduced into Escherichia coli. When the transposon excised precisely from the chimeric cosmid in E. coli, the resulting streptococcal DNA showed the same restriction pattern as the homologous chromosomal region in the parental nonmutagenized streptococcus. The sequence of the promoter for emm was not altered in the mry mutant. The reduction in protein correlates with a decrease in the amount of M protein-specific mRNA, indicating that mry regulates transcription of emm.\r"

Sodium channels purified from rat brain are approximately 18% RI and 80% RII. In brain, the RII subtype is preferentially expressed with RI/RII ratios ranging from 0.07 in the hippocampus to 0.17 in the cerebral cortex. The RI subtype is preferentially expressed in more caudal areas of the central nervous system with values of RI/RII of 0.98 for medulla oblongata and 2.2 for spinal cord. Expression of additional unidentified sodium channel subtype(s) is detected in midbrain, medulla, and spinal cord, and expression of unidentified sodium channel subtypes predominates over expression of RI and RII in retina and optic nerve. The RI and RII subtypes are primarily expressed in the central nervous system and are not detected in significant numbers in skeletal or cardiac muscle, sympathetic ganglia, adrenal medulla, sciatic nerve, or cauda equina. The RII subtype appears first in development of both brain and spinal cord but declines in adult spinal cord as the RI subtype increases. The strict regional expression of these two sodium channel subtypes suggests that they may have distinct functional properties or physiological roles.\r"

By reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay, cerebellum and DCoN in rat were found to contain similar concentrations of this hexadecapeptide. Immunocytochemistry with our rabbit antiserum C1, raised against synthetic cerebellin, revealed that cerebellin-like immunoreactivity in the cerebellum is localized exclusively to Purkinje cells, while in the DCoN, it is found primarily in cartwheel cells and in the basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Some displaced Purkinje cells were also stained. Although cerebellum and DCoN receive their inputs from different brain regions, their organizations show several similarities, with many neuronal cell types present in one having their presumed homologue in the other. Cerebellin is present in Purkinje and cartwheel cells throughout the cerebellum and the DCoN without site predilection. This should be viewed together with recent data indicating that these two classes of neurons share a similar fate in several murine mutations (\"nervous,\" \"lurcher,\" \"Purkinje cell degeneration,\" and \"staggerer\"). This situation leads us to conclude that cerebellin represents a marker for a small number of spatially related neuronal cell classes, and that it may play a role in an as yet unknown aspect of a circuit function worthy of further exploration.\r"

Regions of the rat brain stained with this antibody paralleled those areas of the brain exhibiting [3H]nicotine binding sites and corresponded to areas in which mRNAs encoding for alpha subunits of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor are present. Thus, the anteroventral thalamus, cortex, hippocampus, medial habenula, interpeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area exhibited significant immunoreactivity. Neurons of the medial habenula and substantia nigra were densely stained, and processes were prominently delineated. Furthermore, in the projection areas of the medial habenula (interpeduncular nucleus and median raphe) axons were strongly immunoreactive and were distributed to distinct subdivisions of the target sites. The present data suggest that there are several discrete neuronal systems in which nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have functional importance. These immunohistochemical studies delineate at the single-cell level the localization within the mammalian central nervous system of certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.\r"

  ".U": "88068658\r", 
  ".W": "In primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells, protein kinase C (PKC) translocation and activation can be triggered by the stimulation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter receptors. Glutamate evokes a dose-related translocation of 4-beta-[3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3H]-P(BtO)2) binding sites from the cytosol to the neuronal membrane and stimulates the incorporation of 32P into a number of membrane proteins, particularly protein bands in the range of 80, 50, and 40 kDa. The glutamate-evoked PKC translocation is Mg2+ sensitive, is prevented by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and phencyclidine, is not inhibited by nitrendipine (a voltage-dependent Ca2+-channel blocker) but is abolished by the removal of Ca2+ from the incubation medium, suggesting that glutamate-mediated Ca2+ influx is operative in the redistribution of PKC. Exposure of granule cells to the gangliosides trisialosylgangliotetraglycosylceramide (GT1b) or monosialosylgangliotetraglycosylceramide (GM1) inhibits the translocation and activation of PKC evoked by glutamate. These glycosphingolipids fail to interfere with glutamate binding to its high-affinity recognition site or with the [3H]P(BtO)2 binding, nor do they affect the Ca2+ influx. These gangliosides may prevent PKC translocation by interfering with the PKC binding to the neuronal membrane phosphatidylserine.\r"

In addition to the expression on certain neuroblast populations it is found on some but not all axons and is also expressed at high levels on the end feet of radial glia in regions through which axons actively grow. In the perinatal rat retina, almost all the antigenic activity was carried on a ganglioside migrating between GM1 and GM2. The epitope recognized by antibody JONES was base labile and treatment with 0.1 M sodium carbonate or ammonia vapor converted the antigen into GD3. Resistance to oxidation by sodium periodate and reformation of the epitope by chemical acetylation of base-treated gangliosides with N-acetylimidazole identify the antigen as 9-O-acetyl GD3. The acetylation of GD3 seems to be regulated independently from GD3 expression itself since acetylated and nonacetylated GD3 do not have identical immunocytochemical distributions in the developing central nervous system. In addition, five independent human melanoma cell lines varied substantially in their expression of 9-O-acetyl GD3, even though they all expressed high levels of GD3. Acetylation of ganglioside-linked sialic acid provides a mechanism for generating unique patterns of surface carbohydrates, which may influence cell interactions in development.\r"

This suggests that modulation of the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) \"pulse generator\" by this steroid is not of major physiological importance. Herein is described the unexpected inhibition or total blockade of the electrical activity of this pulse generator in ovariectomized monkeys by physiological levels of exogenous E2. This inhibition began 2-4.5 hr after the initiation of E2 infusion and was noted 1 to 3 weeks after subcutaneous implantation of E2-containing capsules. Pulse generator activity was also arrested during the initiation and subsequent development of estrogen-induced surges of luteinizing hormone. We propose that this inhibition of hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator activity by E2 in ovariectomized monkeys reflects the absence of an ovarian factor that normally protects this neuronal system from the inhibitory action of estrogen during the menstrual cycle.\r"

The single most common cause was tuberculosis (40 per cent) with cryptococcosis (7 per cent), malignancy (8 per cent) and other definable causes much less frequent. In one-third of patients (34 per cent) no cause was found although most appeared to respond to treatment either with anti-tuberculosis drugs or steroids. There were some differences in clinical presentation, the clinical picture being most characteristic in tuberculous meningitis and malignant meningitis. However, there were frequent exceptions to any general rule and, particularly in adults, the clinical features and changes in cell count, protein and glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) did not reliably distinguish one form of chronic meningitis from another. Cerebral and meningeal biopsy produced disappointing results with respect to practical guidance in management. It is often necessary to begin treatment before a cause has been identified. Important points in management include the early use of anti-tuberculosis treatment and the difficulty in deciding on a trial of treatment with corticosteroids or amphotericin B. Not emphasised in previous reports is a subgroup of patients with idiopathic chronic meningitis who are responsive to treatment with steroids. Those patients tend to follow a more prolonged indolent course and often require long-term immunosuppression to control symptoms.\r"

Axial pre- and postcontrast images demonstrated a total of six and 38 metastases, respectively. Of the 35 lesions detected only after administration of contrast material, all were less than 10 mm, and none had evidence of surrounding edema. Lesion conspicuity was comparable on postcontrast mixed (T1, proton density, and T2) images and T1-weighted images, indicating the feasibility of effectively screening for metastases with a single postcontrast spin-echo sequence providing mixed and T2-weighted images. Sagittal and coronal images depicted temporal lobe lesions not seen on axial images. No discomfort, side effects, or complications resulted from the contrast medium. The detection of additional lesions with Gd-DTPA increased the radiologic suspicion of metastatic disease, revealed locations more favorable for biopsy, prompted the search for a primary tumor, and modified therapeutic objectives and methods.\r"

Scanning in familiar planes provided images that are easier to interpret. In addition, correlation of these images with cryomicrotome sections and histochemical studies disclosed several new findings. The articular cartilage of infant hips-composed mostly of water-is anechoic. However, the hyaline cartilage-which contains many vascular channels, columns of cartilage cells, and mesenchymal stroma-appears as alternating hypoechoic or anechoic columns and echogenic columns. The fibrocartilage of the limbus, on the other hand, is echogenic, as are other fibrous tissues. As expected, the points of attachment of the distal aspect of the synovial membrane, the fibrous capsule, and the ligaments in relation to the epiphyseal growth plate, varied with age, as did the characteristics of the cartilaginous structures. Familiarization with the sonographic appearance of normal hip anatomy in subjects of all ages is a first step toward recognition of various pathologic entities of the hip.\r"

In the 19 previously reported cases, there were only two cases of cystic fibrosis, neither with intraabdominal calcifications. The presence of calcifications was significantly associated with causes other than cystic fibrosis. Prenatally diagnosed cases of meconium peritonitis are associated with cystic fibrosis less frequently than previous studies suggest.\r"

No lateralization was noted with respect to distribution of bleeding sites or areas of nonhemorrhagic abnormalities. US was a sensitive but imperfect screening tool for intracranial abnormalities. Abnormalities missed with US included peripheral and small parenchymal lesions, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral atrophy, and sagittal sinus thrombosis.\r"

Presence of abnormality at neuroimaging and the neuroimaging score were correlated with the findings of neurodevelopmental evaluations (Bayley scales) performed in infants who were at a mean age of 11.8 months (range, 6-16 months). A significant inverse correlation was found between the neuroimaging score and mental and psychomotor development indexes of the Bayley scale (P less than .005). Mean neuroimaging scores in infants with normal development were significantly lower than those in infants with delayed development (P = .002). Although individual outcomes cannot be predicted with neuroimaging, the neuroimaging score can be a useful adjunct in assigning patients who survive with ECMO treatment to risk categories for developmental outcome.\r"

On follow-up study of four of the invasive moles, disappearance of the hypoechoic area due to blood flow was observed when chemotherapy was successful.

Color Doppler imaging allowed faster detection of intraaneurysmal flow, and the track between the injured artery and the pseudoaneurysm was identified only with color Doppler imaging.

At cholecystostomy, the fundus of the gallbladder was sutured to the anterior abdominal wall resulting in a short surgical track to the gallbladder. This permitted early percutaneous stone removal through the cholecystostomy track under fluoroscopic guidance. All gallstones were removed in 31 of 36 patients, for an overall success rate of 86%. The success rate was 97% for gallbladder stones, 86% for cystic duct stones, and 63% for common bile duct stones that were removed by traversing the cystic duct. The treatment in the five patients in whom radiologic stone removal was incomplete or unsuccessful consisted of elective cholecystectomy in three, with common bile duct exploration in two of these; endoscopic sphincterotomy and stone extraction in one; and expectant management in one. There were no deaths or serious complications. This technique has thus proved safe and effective in these 36 high-risk patients.\r"

Signal homogeneity within the abscess was present more often on T1- than on T2-weighted images. Diaphragmatic disruption was seen in two cases on coronal MR images. An amebic empyema was differentiable from sympathetic pleural effusions by its hyperintensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. In patients who also underwent computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography (US), no lesion was missed with any modality, and except for shape, no consistent features were found among images obtained with the different modalities. The data suggest that CT, US, and MR imaging are comparably effective in the detection of amebic abscess.\r"

In 96 recently treated patients, therapeutic aspiration and percutaneous drainage were rarely needed. Most cases were correctly diagnosed by means of clinical, laboratory, and sonographic findings. Abscesses in only 13 (13.5%) patients were diagnostically aspirated. An abscess in one patient was therapeutically aspirated because the patient was responding slowly to medical therapy. No patient required catheter drainage. The key to successful amebic abscess management is medical therapy. Therapeutic drainage is rarely needed. Successfully treated patients occasionally respond slowly to medical therapy, and successfully treated amebic abscesses may enlarge or become bizarre-appearing on sonograms. This should not prompt therapeutic drainage. Diagnostic aspiration is appropriate when amebic and pyogenic abscesses are indistinguishable using clinical and imaging findings. Rare indications for therapeutic aspiration or drainage include pyogenic superinfection and large, juxtacardiac abscesses (potential intrapericardial rupture).\r"

The US and pathologic findings were correlated in three surgical specimens of gastric lymphoma. Three different US patterns were found in gastric lymphomas: a polypoid pattern (two cases), localized (two cases) or extended (five cases) hypoechoic infiltration, and thickening with superficial ulcerations. Infiltration was confined to the second and third layers of the gastric wall in six cases and was transmural in three. The study of the gastric lymphoma specimens confirmed the accuracy of US in demonstrating the extent of infiltration. Gastric carcinomas had a more echogenic pattern and a different trend of diffusion, with no extended longitudinal hypoechoic infiltration of the superficial layers or extended hypoechoic transmural infiltration.\r"

US had an accuracy of 92.5% in demonstrating invasion of the submucosa and 77% for invasion of the muscularis externa. For mucosal neoplasms with invasion through the muscularis externa and extension into the subserosal tissues, nearly 90% of US interpretations were correct.

A case of community-acquired pneumonia and bacteremia due to Achromobacter in a patient with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis is reported herein. The majority of patients who have developed achromobacter bacteremia have had a predisposition to infection (although the predisposing conditions have been diverse). Immunosuppression has been reported in only one of the seven patients with achromobacter bacteremia for whom detailed information is available. Achromobacter is usually resistant to ampicillin, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides. Antipseudomonal penicillins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole inhibit most isolates. Multiple-drug resistance is common, and optimal therapy is not known.\r"

C. lusitaniae may be misidentified as one of several other fungal species, including Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, and even Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As judged by in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing, minimal inhibitory concentrations of antifungal agents other than amphotericin B are achievable, but fungicidal levels are not. When encountered in blood or other body sites, C. lusitaniae should be carefully considered as a potential pathogen.\r"

When tests were first performed within six months of onset of lymphadenopathy, single high titers of IgG toxoplasma antibodies (suggestive of acute infection) were found with the Sabin-Feldman dye test and the direct agglutination test in 93% and 76% of cases, respectively. Observations of significant rises in titer were uncommon because of the late acquisition of sera. Within the first six months after the onset of lymphadenopathy, IgM toxoplasma antibody was demonstrable by the double-sandwich IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 88% of cases and by the IgM-immunofluorescent antibody test in 78%. Twenty percent of patients who had serum samples drawn more than 12 months after onset lymphadenopathy still had IgM toxoplasma antibodies demonstrable by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No patient first tested six or more months after onset of lymphadenopathy was positive in the IgM-immunofluorescent antibody test. These results provide the basis for recommendations on the use of serologic tests for the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmic lymphadenopathy.\r"

A review of 70 cases of CNS actinomycosis was conducted in an effort to characterize clinicopathologic features and identify patients with a high risk of death from infection. Types of lesions included brain abscess (67%), meningitis or meningoencephalitis (13%), actinomycoma (7%), subdural empyema (6%), and epidural abscess (6%). Most infections developed from distant sites (lung, 19 cases; abdomen, four; pelvis, three) or contiguous foci (ear, sinus, and cervicofacial region, 21 cases). For nonmeningitic infection, signs and symptoms were generally those of a space-occupying lesion and were indistinguishable from the manifestations of other pyogenic infections except for a longer interval before diagnosis. Risk factors included dental caries; dental infection; recent tooth extraction; head trauma; gastrointestinal tract surgery; chronic otitis, mastoiditis, or sinusitis; chronic osteomyelitis; tetralogy of Fallot; and actinomyces infection of an intrauterine device. Optimal management combined adequate surgical drainage with prolonged antibiotic therapy (mean duration, 5 months). Overall mortality from treated infection was 28%; 54% of survivors had neurologic sequelae. Features correlated with a poor prognosis were disease onset greater than 2 months before diagnosis and treatment, no antibiotic treatment, no surgery, and needle aspiration drainage of abscess lesions.\r"

The protection against disease imparted by pertussis vaccines may be greater than that against infection. Estimates of vaccine efficacy from case-control studies are higher than those from studies of household secondary-attack rates; likewise, estimates of efficacy are higher when based on clinically severe or bacteriologically positive cases rather than simply on notified cases. Some of the reported differences in protection by different vaccines may be attributable to relations between the antigenic composition of the vaccine used and that of the circulating strain of Bordetella pertussis. Failure to consider age trends has sometimes led to spuriously high estimates of efficacy. Many biases can affect efficacy studies, and it is usually difficult to assess whether the net effect has been to underestimate or to overestimate \"true\" efficacy. The immunity imparted by conventional pertussis vaccines may be neither as solid nor as stable as that imparted by many live-virus vaccines. These issues must be considered during the evaluation of acellular pertussis vaccines.\r"

Splenectomized patients and those with alcoholic liver disease are most susceptible to DF-2 infection. The clinical picture can be one of fulminant septicemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation in the splenectomized patient; the presentation is milder in the alcoholic patient. The overall mortality from DF-2 septicemia among the 41 cases reported in the literature is 27%. The organism is sensitive to penicillin, resistant to aminoglycosides, and not easily grown on common media. It appears to be serum-sensitive in tests with normal human serum. Penicillin prophylaxis of dog bite wounds is especially important in high-risk patients. DF-2 infection should be considered when any splenectomized patient develops fulminant septicemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and peripheral gangrene. Examination of a gram stain of the peripheral blood or buffy coat is of value in such cases.\r"

Only 14% of the episodes were community-acquired, and 29% were due to methicillin-resistant strains. The commonest foci of SAB were intravascular catheters (33%), postoperative wounds (11%), skin infections (7%), and pulmonary infections (7%). Complications were infrequent, with endocarditis in two patients and metastatic infection in one. Mortality due to SAB was 32%, with no difference in mortality between community-acquired and hospital-acquired SAB. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend of higher mortality for methicillin-resistant SAB (42%) than for methicillin-sensitive SAB (28%) and for patients with no focus of SAB (43%) than for those with a defined primary focus (28%). A review of studies of SAB published since 1940 revealed several trends. SAB is now predominately a nosocomial infection; intravascular-catheter infection has become the commonest cause of SAB; with several exceptions, the risk of endocarditis in patients with SAB is low (5%-20%); mortality due to SAB has decreased over the past 40 years but not over the past 10 years.\r"

  ".W": "Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus induction of diabetes mellitus in mice has proven to be an excellent experimental model for the pathogenesis of viral disease. In SJL and DBA/2 mice, diabetes results exclusively from the infection and damage of beta cells by the virus. In addition, in BALB/cBy mice subclinical beta cell damage caused by the virus is followed by autoimmune beta cell destruction, which results in hyperglycemia. Studies of two closely related plaque variants (EMC-D and EMC-B) selected from the M strain of EMC virus revealed differences in the interferon response associated with viral infection. The EMC-D variant causes diabetes in infected SJL mice by direct beta cell destruction. Infection with EMC-B does not cause diabetes and interferes with the production of diabetes by EMC-D due to the greater ability of EMC-B than of EMC-D to induce interferon in mice. Circulating interferon has a greater effect on inhibition of viral replication because local interferon production is amplified in interferon-primed cells infected with EMC-B. These properties are determined by the interferon-inducing particle (Ifp+) phenotype of EMC-B and the Ifp- phenotype of EMC-D.\r"

Salmonellosis may occur in patients with an established diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or it may be the first manifestation of this disorder. In patients with AIDS, salmonellosis is characterized by recurrent bacteremia despite treatment and a relative paucity of gastrointestinal manifestations. Treatment regimens may be limited by antimicrobial resistance, poor penetration of antibiotics into phagocytes, and drug intolerance; optimal therapy remains to be established. Possible mechanisms to account for this increased frequency and severity of salmonellosis include altered cell-mediated immunity, hemolysis, prior use of antibiotics, and increased exposure to the pathogen. Salmonellae should be considered among the pathogens associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection.\r"

Cattle, sheep, goats, and ticks are the primary reservoirs of the etiologic agent, Coxiella burnetii. Humans are usually infected by inhaling infectious aerosols. Because C. burnetii can survive for long periods in the environment, it poses a continuing health hazard once it is disseminated. Q fever usually occurs sporadically, but large outbreaks are frequently observed throughout the world, particularly among abattoir workers and personnel working in research centers. Q fever endocarditis follows a chronic course and is frequently fatal. Tests for antibodies to C. burnetii are required for confirmation of the diagnosis. Tetracyclines remain the mainstay of treatment for acute Q fever, and tetracyclines in combination with other antibiotics have been advocated for patients with Q fever endocarditis. Vaccines for Q fever have been proven effective in clinical trials.\r"

However, the efficiency of heterosexual transmission and related risk factors remain unclear. Viral transmission from males to their female sexual partners is well documented, although in the United States instances of female-to-male transmission have been observed less frequently. On the other hand, in parts of Africa and Haiti, AIDS appears to be a bidirectional, heterosexually transmitted disease that often occurs concurrently with other sexually transmitted diseases. Although a widespread heterosexual epidemic of AIDS could evolve in the United States, it seems more plausible that, like other sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS will settle in limited segments of the community characterized by certain high-risk behaviors.\r"

Neurocysticercosis should be suspected in any patient from a high-risk region who has symptoms or signs of a central nervous system disorder, especially seizures, headaches, or signs of increased intracranial pressure. The best diagnostic test is CT of the head, which usually shows a combination of multiple punctate calcifications; hydrocephalus; and parenchymal, subarachnoid, or intraventricular cysts with and without contrast enhancement. Cysticercosis is confirmed serologically by measurement of cysticercosis antibody titers in serum or cerebrospinal fluid and histologically by biopsy of a lesion. Treatment with praziquantel and dexamethasone is usually sufficient, but ventricular shunting or surgical removal of intraventricular or spinal cysts may be necessary. Whenever a case is identified, other household members should be examined for symptoms and signs of neurocysticercosis and screened for active Taenia solium infection.\r"

In many ways these flaws have resulted from the limitations and conventions of traditional journalism, especially the need to appeal to a large mainstream audience and a reliance on authorities as sources and validators of information. News stories typically rely on a single articulate authority, and articles that involve conspiracy or controversy or have a high entertainment value are favored. Although coverage of politics and social issues is not distorted by these journalistic conventions, coverage of science suffers. Analysis of news coverage of AIDS shows that mass media often respond to sensationalism rather than to important scientific developments. In addition, scientific disagreements are better adjudicated by evidence than by appeals to authority. As a result, media coverage often obscures the process of scientific deliberation. Public health officials need to consider setting up a special channel of communications to clarify information about AIDS.\r"

Few Americans had participated in the advances in bacteriology led by Koch and Pasteur when a laboratory from which the NIH eventually developed was established in New York in 1887, but its first director patterned this laboratory after ones already established in Germany, France, and England. The era of modern biomedical research in the United States began during World War II with the cooperation of government and nongovernment (mostly academic) research laboratories. Today, the philosophical foundation underlying all research-supporting programs of the NIH is that a close connection exists between improved medical care and research and that any expansion of medical facilities must be accompanied by an expansion of medical training and research. In addition, government grants should not interfere with the freedom and integrity of academic institutions and should allow scientists complete independence in determining the nature, scope, and methodology of their investigations. Discoveries in genetics in the 1950's and 1960's heralded an era of science in which it was necessary to address major questions with immediate relevance to human health. Impelled by pressure from the public, the scientific community, and the Congress, the NIH participates in formulating safety guidelines regarding potential applications of biotechnology. The annual increase in funds appropriated by Congress to the NIH attests to a high level of public commitment to the support of biomedical research and underlines the degree of accountability to which the NIH is subject.\r"

Consequently, mobile genetic elements--plasmids, bacteriophages, and transposons--have been the central factors in the evolution of pathogenic traits. One central feature of pathogenicity, the capacity to enter epithelial cells, is encoded by the bacterial chromosome of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis but by plasmid genes in enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. A single Yersinia gene, inv, which encodes a single 107,000-dalton protein, can be cloned in E. coli K12, and its presence is sufficient to permit the bacteria to enter cultured human cells. In contrast, fully 70 kilobases of a virulence plasmid from enteroinvasive E. coli must be transferred to E. coli K12 to achieve the same result. While researchers are at the early stages of understanding microbial entry into host cells, they can now investigate the molecular basis of this event in greater detail than has previously been possible.\r"

  ".W": "The two varieties of fimbriae identified on oral strains of actinomyces have distinct functional properties. The type 1 fimbriae of Actinomyces viscosus T14V mediate attachment to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Type 2 fimbriae--on A. viscosus and the only fimbriae detected on A. naeslundii WVU45--are associated with lectin activity. Interaction of these fimbriae with complementary receptors initiates bacterial attachment to Streptococcus sanguis 34 and sialidase-treated epithelial cells and the killing of actinomyces by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), and related oligosaccharides inhibit these processes, and mutants lacking type 2 fimbriae do not participate in them. The actinomyces lectin is similar to lectins from Ricinus communis and Bauhinia purpurea that agglutinate certain strains of oral streptococci, block attachment of actinomyces to epithelial cells, and inhibit killing of actinomyces by PMNs. The S. sanguis receptor for the actinomyces lectin comprises repeating hexasaccharide units with GalNAc termini. Used as probes, the peanut agglutinin, with specificity for Gal(beta-3)GalNAc, and the lectin from B. purpurea detect a 160-kilodalton (kdal) band in SDS-PAGE-separated epithelial cell extracts and a 100-kdal band in PMN extracts. These may be receptors for type 2 fimbriae. A. viscosus genes encoding subunits of types 1 and 2 fimbriae have been cloned in Escherichia coli; the type 1 subunit is 65 kdal and the type 2 subunit is 59 kdal. Submandibular immunization of mice with a mixture of type 1 and type 2 fimbriae evokes the production of IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva that inhibit in vitro adsorption of A. viscosus to SHA. These antibodies may modulate colonization of teeth by this organism.\r"

  ".U": "88070123\r", 
  ".W": "It is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner. After the organisms penetrate the nonspecific mechanical and cleansing forces, ligands (or adhesins) on the surface of the bacteria interact in a lock-and-key (or induced-fit) fashion with complementary receptors on mucosal surfaces of the host. The adhesins are usually composed of proteins in the form of fimbriae or fibrillae and the receptors of glycolipids or glycoproteins. In group A streptococci the adhesin, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), is anchored to one or more proteins on the surface of the bacterial cells and interacts through its lipid moiety with fibronectin molecules deposited on and bound to the epithelial cells. In an attempt to locate the region of fibronectin recognized by LTA and group A streptococci, fibronectin was cleaved with thermolysin and the fragment mixture adsorbed with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococci adsorbed several high-molecular-weight fragments as well as a 28-kilodalton and a 23-kilodalton fragment, whereas S. pyogenes cells adsorbed only the 28-kilodalton fragment completely. The adsorption of the fragments by S. pyogenes was blocked by LTA. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide copying the NH2 terminus of fibronectin reacted in a western blot with the 28-kilodalton fragment; this result indicated that S. pyogenes and its LTA react with the NH2-terminal region of fibronectin at a site distinct from that at which S. aureus reacts. Our findings are consistent with the idea that LTA mediates the attachment of group A streptococci to fatty acid binding sites of fibronectin deposited on mucosal epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "Understanding of the pathogenesis of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) has come from the juxtaposition of epidemiologic, clinical, immunologic, and physiologic studies. A hypothesis has been developed for the pathogenesis of menstrually related TSS. Certain tampon fibers that are highly absorbent for water are also ion exchangers for magnesium ions. The latter ions uniquely affect the production of TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1) by appropriate strains of Staphylococcus aureus, with a marked increase in the amount of toxin when magnesium concentrations are limiting and suppression of toxin production when magnesium is in excess. Many epidemiologic features of TSS could be explained by this hypothesis. The absorbability of highly absorptive fibers is not affected by the addition of small amounts of magnesium sufficient to suppress production of TSST-1; thus absorption is distinguishable from toxin production in vitro. TSST-1 stimulates production of interleukin 1 and of tumor necrosis factor and is highly toxic when absorbed slowly. Like TSST-1, staphylococcal enterotoxins are lethal to rabbits when given by slow injection, and some enterotoxins may be more lethal than TSST-1.\r"

Single amino acid substitutions were found to have profound effects on the physicochemical behavior of the proteins and on their immunologic reactivity. With the use of enzyme-linked immunosorption assays (ELISAs) with and without the GM1 ganglioside receptor for these toxins, several distinct epitopes in GM1-binding domains were identified by different monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal rabbit antisera to synthetic peptides of the cholera enterotoxin B subunit were cross-reactive to various degrees with the proteins in our library, which include two different cholera enterotoxins, two H-LTs, P-LT, and four chimeric proteins. Some of these reactions were blocked by GM1 ganglioside but not the oligosaccharide of GM1, a finding suggesting that the peptides generated antibodies to epitopes near, but not in, a GM1-binding domain. A hypothetical evolutionary tree based on the reported amino acid sequences of the various enterotoxins is constructed. As additional enterotoxins are described, it will be interesting to determine if and where they fit in this scheme.\r"

The major points can be summarized as follows. (1) Recent results obtained by the use of synthetic analogues of lipid A structures proved unequivocally that the lipid moiety of the endotoxin is the carrier of toxic properties. Incomplete or attenuated structures are inactive in some or all toxic reactions, depending on the extent of deviations from the structure of the native product. (2) On the other hand, some beneficial reactions can be initiated not only by the complete structures but by their structural remains, which are no longer toxic. (3) Some of the split products in the lipid-free and polysaccharide-rich preparations can induce beneficial reactions. (4) Gram-negative bacteria can produce endotoxin-unrelated and beneficial compounds. Conventional endotoxin preparations are heterogeneous and often contain some of these unrelated substances. (5) Elucidation of the exact structural requirements of endotoxic reactions has just begun. It appears to be safe to predict that individual reactions will require highly specific structures or physicochemical properties. The potential rewards of such research might be quite significant by facilitating our understanding of the molecular events of the beneficial effects of endotoxins and by directing the search for preparations with therapeutic applications.\r"

  ".U": "88070128\r", 
  ".W": "The major surface antigens of Escherichia coli are the cell wall lipopolysaccharides (LPS; O antigens) and the capsular polysaccharides (PS; K antigens). These polysaccharides are synthesized at the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacteria; the LPS are transported to the outer membrane, where they reside, whereas the PS are secreted into capsules. The LPS consist of lipid A covalently linked to the core oligosaccharide, which itself is covalently linked to the O-specific polysaccharide. The latter, which determines the O specificity of the bacteria may be neutral or contain negative charges (carboxyl groups or phosphate). The relatedness of E. coli to other genera (e.g., Klebsiella or Shigella) frequently is borne out by structural identity. This intergeneric relation is paralleled by similar pathogenic properties of the bacteria in question. The capsular antigens of E. coli are acidic polysaccharides, which can be divided into groups (I and II) on the basis of molecular size, nature of the acidic component, coexpression with O antigens, and temperature regulation of their biosynthesis. The major acidic components are hexuronic acid (mainly of Klebsiella-like group I) as well as 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-mannooctulonic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid, or phosphate (mainly in Neisseria- and Haemophilus-like group II). Relatedness of encapsulated E. coli to encapsulated bacteria of other genera (Neisseria, Haemophilus, Klebsiella) is based on structural identity or similarity of the respective capsules. Identity not only refers to structure and serology of these capsules but also to the pathogenicity of the respective bacteria (e.g., E. coli K1 and Neisseria meningitidis b). Bacterial pathogenicity may be caused by the host's inability to raise an immune response to bacterial capsules (E. coli K1 and K5) because of the identity of the capsular polysaccharides and the host carbohydrates. This can be described as camouflage used by the bacteria as a strategem for bacterial virulence.\r"

  ".W": "The chemical structure of the lipid A component of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is now known in some detail. For example, lipid A of Escherichia coli consists of a beta(1----6)-linked D-glucosamine disaccharide that carries four (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl groups in positions 2, 3, 2', and 3' and two phosphoryl residues in positions 1 and 4'. The hydroxy fatty acids at positions 2' and 3' are acylated at their 3-hydroxyl groups by dodecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid, respectively. The hydroxyl groups in positions 4 and 6' are free, the latter serving as the attachment site for the polysaccharide component in intact LPS. On the basis of this structure, E. coli-type lipid A and partial structures thereof have been chemically synthesized (group of T. Shiba, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) and analyzed for endotoxic activity. In all in vivo and in vitro test systems employed (including lethal toxicity, pyrogenicity, local Shwartzman reactivity, B lymphocyte mitogenicity, macrophage activation, and serologic cross-reactivity with lipid A antiserum), synthetic lipid A has activity identical to that of E. coli lipid A. These findings support the structural proposal for lipid A and prove the previous hypothesis that the endotoxic principle is embedded in lipid A.\r"

  ".W": "The factors controlling lysis of gram-negative bacteria by complement are being investigated systematically. The first question was how smooth Salmonella minnesota, which has on its surface lipopolysaccharide with long O polysaccharide side chains, avoids lysis. Rough organisms are serum sensitive. In both smooth and rough organisms, complement components are deposited on the surface and the lytic sequence proceeds to completion. However, with serum-resistant organisms the membrane attack complex (MAC), composed of late-acting complement proteins, does not successfully insert into the outer membrane to cause membrane damage. At the completion of the lytic sequence, the hydrophobic MAC is shed. C3b, which directs late component assembly, is deposited on the longest O polysaccharide side chains on these smooth organisms, where it does not direct successful insertion of the MAC into the outer membrane. Serum-resistant gonococci sequester the MAC on the organism's surface in association with specific outer membrane components, where it does no damage to the outer membrane. Antibody appears to mediate site-directed complement component deposition in a number of systems. Thus, depending on antibody specificity, complement may be deposited on the organism's surface to cause successful complement attack or may block complement attack induced by bactericidal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies of the same isotype directed at different epitopes on the same bacterial surface antigen may either induce lysis or block lytic attack.\r"

Upon adequate stimulation (e.g., by endotoxin, by lectins, in the course of immune reactions, and in response to lymphokines of T cell origin), macrophages and monocytes synthesize tissue thromboplastin and expose it on their surface. Leukocyte proteases may interfere with blood coagulation by degrading clotting factors, in particular factors V, VIII, and XIII. Furthermore, these enzymes act as fibrinolytic agents, which also cleave fibrinogen. Leukocyte elastase attacks the platelet glycoproteins Ib (the receptor for von Willebrand factor) and V (a thrombin substrate) and at the same time exposes the platelet fibrinogen receptor. Platelet-activating factor of leukocyte origin may induce platelet aggregation and is a powerful potentiator of other inducers of platelet activity. The last-mentioned property has also been reported for leukotrienes. Activated leukocytes and their products play an important role in the pathogenesis of important disorders of the hemostatic system, with disseminated intravascular coagulation as the most prominent example.\r"

A direct or complement-mediated release of eicosanoids--depending on the species, the tissue, and the kind of endotoxin--has been found to be associated with endotoxemic shock. Prostacyclin appears to be partially responsible for the early decrease in blood pressure and clearly induces the sustained hypotension of endotoxemia but is irrelevant to its fatal outcome. In contrast, simultaneous administration of vasodilating prostanoids such as prostaglandin E1 and metabolically stable analogues of prostacyclin prevents endotoxin lethality. Thromboxane A2 may contribute to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, but its quantitative importance often is obscured by other mediators. The peptidoleukotrienes, in particular leukotriene D4, contribute to lung damage and--in galactosamine-sensitized rats, at least--to fatal liver destruction. Little is known about the role of leukotriene B4 in endotoxemia. Endotoxin suppresses rather than stimulates superoxide release from phagocytes in vitro but leads to massive free-radical formation mediated by complement activation in vivo and, thereby, contributes to lung injury.\r"

Three lines of evidence support the conclusion that the cysteinyl leukotrienes are involved in the lethal shock-inducing action of endotoxin. (1) Endotoxin elicits the systemic production of cysteinyl leukotrienes in vivo. (2) Injection of these leukotrienes into sensitive species causes shock-like reactions, myocardial depression, and extravasation of plasma. (3) Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists and inhibitors of leukotriene synthesis prevent experimental endotoxin shock. Moreover, endotoxin induces a strong inhibition of the hepatobiliary elimination of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which normally represents the major pathway for deactivation of these mediators. This dual action of endotoxin, comprising enhanced synthesis and simultaneously impaired deactivation of potent mediators, points to a novel type of toxin action. The role of cysteinyl leukotrienes in endotoxin action does not exclude the involvement of additional shock-inducing factors released by endotoxin and their possible contribution to the formation of lipid mediators, including leukotrienes.\r"

Increased new formation and increased release of histamine are the two hypotheses currently considered as the basis for a causal relationship. Both hypotheses were tested in a standardized rat model of endotoxic shock. Several randomized controlled studies were performed with inhibitors of histamine formation (histidine decarboxylase inhibitors) and of its action via receptors (H1 and H2 receptor antagonists). Two inhibitors of histamine formation (alpha-methylhistidine and alpha-fluoromethylhistidine) in a wide range of doses exerted no significant effects on survival curves for rats in endotoxic shock, despite enzyme inhibition in vitro and in homogenates of liver obtained from rats immediately after death. In addition, three H1 and three H2 receptor antagonists, which were selected on the basis of markedly different antihistaminic efficacies and of defined non-antihistaminic (nonspecific) efficacies, gave no indications of specific histamine-mediated effects on survival parameters in these studies when tested either singly or in various combinations. Thus, histamine cannot be shown to be a predominant factor in the lethal outcome of endotoxic shock in rats.\r"

The urine of febrile individuals contains elevated levels of a 30-40 kilodalton (kdal) glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of IL-1-induced proliferation of murine thymocytes. This inhibitor from febrile individuals also blocks antigen-induced activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro but increases, rather than decreases IL-1-induced production of prostaglandin E2 by fibroblasts. Uromodulin, an 85-kdal glycoprotein derived from the urine of pregnant women, is also a potent inhibitor of IL-1-induced thymocyte proliferation and human lymphocyte activation. Differences in molecular weight, biologic activity, and antigenicity suggest that uromodulin and the febrile inhibitor are distinct entities. Urine of some individuals has also been found to contain large amounts of a third IL-1 inhibitor that is 20-25 kdal in size. Unlike the febrile inhibitor and uromodulin, this 25-kdal molecule has been found to be a potent inhibitor of IL-1-induced production of prostaglandin E2 by fibroblasts as well as of the proliferation of thymocytes. The biologic activities of these three inhibitors indicate that they may be part of an important physiologic system for the regulation of immunity and inflammation in humans.\r"

These beneficial effects are achieved by pretreatment with minute amounts of endotoxin. Recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) are among the mediators capable of invoking radioprotection or resistance to the consequences of cecal ligation and puncture. Both cytokines are potent inducers of serum colony-stimulating factor (CSF) in C3H/HeJ mice (low responders to endotoxin). The number of splenic granulocyte-macrophage precursors was found to increase 5 days after injection of TNF in these mice. Although with IL-1 no increase in the number of granulocyte-macrophage colonies occurred in culture in the presence of serum CSF, a marked stimulation was observed when TNF was added. This stimulation of myelopoiesis observed in vivo and in vitro may be related to the radioprotective effect of TNF. The data presented suggest that TNF and IL-1 released after injection of endotoxin participate in the mediation of endotoxin-induced enhancement of nonspecific resistance and stimulation of hematopoiesis.\r"

The functional state of Kupffer cells was evaluated by measuring both the number of these cells per microscopic field that phagocytosed 1.0-micron latex particles and the rate at which individual Kupffer cells phagocytosed single latex particles. The intrahepatic density and level of activation of Kupffer cells were found to play a role in determining endotoxin sensitivity and to be involved, in conjunction with endotoxin, in the development of tolerance.

  ".W": "Experimental observations indicate that tissue macrophages deployed in great numbers at critical anatomic sites such as the liver, spleen, and lung are major targets for glucocorticoids compromising natural resistance of the host. Therapeutic concentrations of glucocorticoids appear to prevent destruction of microorganisms ingested by macrophages without interfering with phagocytosis, phagolysosomal fusion, and/or secretion of reactive oxygen intermediates. These findings indicate that at the cellular level the glucocorticoid target should be sought for in the nonoxidative armature of the phagocyte and that nonoxidative killing systems of resident tissue macrophages play an important role in natural resistance to opportunistic pathogens. Glucocorticoids do not prevent lymphokine-induced activation of oxidative killing systems. Thus, lymphokines such as interferon-gamma can restore the microbicidal activity of macrophages functionally impaired by glucocorticoids. Counterbalance of the suppressive effect of glucocorticoids by lymphokines might only be possible, however, for pathogens susceptible to oxidative killing and not for microorganisms that are more resistant to reactive oxygen intermediates such as Aspergillus spores and Nocardia, opportunists that appear to be particularly associated with hypercortisolism.\r"

However, the accessibility of core glycolipid epitopes to antibody in the intact bacterial cell may be affected by the cell surface structure. In studies with 125I-labeled monoclonal antibodies to core glycolipid that cross-react with isolated LPS, the degree to which antibodies can bind to LPS in the outer membrane of intact, viable, gram-negative bacterial cells was found to vary with the strain of bacteria tested. Sequestration of bacterial cell-bound LPS from antibody was confirmed in a smooth strain of Escherichia coli by means of immunoelectron microscopy. The inability of antibody to bind to membrane-bound LPS suggests that such sequestered LPS may also be unable to effect toxicity in the infected host until liberated by bacterial cell breakdown.\r"

Information about mechanisms of immunity, gained mainly from experimental models but likely to be relevant to human infection, indicates a dynamic balance between protective and regulatory (blocking) mechanisms. Besides cell-mediated responses leading to macrophage activation, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity systems involving precise antibody isotypes and nonlymphoid cells (mononuclear phagocytes, eosinophils, and platelets) appear to be essential effectors of immune attack. The slow development of immunity in humans seems related to the production of antibodies that cross-react with schistosomulum surface antigen and block the binding of antibodies of the effector isotype. Schistosomes that survive in the bloodstream and produce chronic infections may evade the immune system as a result of intrinsic changes in membrane susceptibility and of transient expression of target antigens; at other stages of the parasite life cycle, cross-reactive molecules may be secreted that play an essential role in the induction of immunity. Several schistosome proteins have been characterized as candidates for vaccination. Among these, an antigen of 28 kilodaltons has been cloned and shown to be immunogenic in humans and protective in mice, rats, and baboons.\r"

Evidence suggests that T cell alpha beta receptors recognize a complex of an antigen-derived peptide bound to one of the cell-surface products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. It is likely that alpha beta receptors and MHC proteins have coevolved to have some affinity for each other. During T cell development in the thymus, cells bearing self-reactive receptors are deleted by the mechanisms of tolerance, and cells are preferentially allowed to mature if they bear receptors that will be able to recognize antigen plus self-MHC after they have become full-fledged T cells. Some explanations for these phenomena have been tested, but no satisfactory theory can yet be proposed to account for them.\r"

Xenopus oocytes injected with messenger RNA isolated from primary cultures of rat brain have now been used to study NMDA receptors. The distinguishing properties of neuronal NMDA receptors have been reproduced in this amphibian cell, including voltage-dependent block by magnesium, block by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, and potentiation by glycine. This preparation should facilitate the quantitative study of the regulation of NMDA receptor activation and serve as a tool for purification of the encoding messenger RNA.\r"

However, little is known about the molecular forms derived from the amino terminal portion of the precursor, even though this part of the prohormone is highly conserved through evolution. By using an antibody against the amino terminus of prosomatostatin, a decapeptide with the structure Ala-Pro-Ser-Asp-Pro-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gln-Phe, corresponding to preprosomatostatin (25-34), was isolated from the endocrine portion of the rat stomach, the gastric antrum. The antral decapeptide may represent a bioactive product generated from prosomatostatin after a monobasic cleavage similar to that involved in the formation of somatostatin-28. In fact, a monobasic cleavage requires two basic residues and a domain containing nonpolar amino acids such as alanine or leucine, or both.\r"

However, the reason for the lower accumulation of chloroquine was unknown. The resistant parasite has now been found to release chloroquine 40 to 50 times more rapidly than the susceptible parasite, although their initial rates of chloroquine accumulation are the same. Verapamil and two other calcium channel blockers, as well as vinblastine and daunomycin, each slowed the release and increased the accumulation of chloroquine by resistant (but not susceptible) Plasmodium falciparum. These results suggest that a higher rate of chloroquine release explains the lower chloroquine accumulation, and thus the resistance observed in resistant Plasmodium falciparum.\r"

A model system with myeloid blood cells has shown that (i) normal blood cells require different proteins to induce cell multiplication (growth inducers) and cell differentiation (differentiation inducers), (ii) there is a hierarchy of growth inducers as cells become more restricted in their developmental program, and (iii) a cascade of interactions between proteins determines the correct balance between immature and mature cells in normal blood cell development. Gene cloning has shown that there is a family of different genes for these proteins. Normal protein regulators of blood cell development can control the abnormal growth of certain types of leukemic cells and suppress malignancy by inducing differentiation to mature nondividing cells. Chromosome abnormalities that give rise to malignancy in these leukemic cells can be bypassed and their effects nullified by inducing differentiation, which stops cells from multiplying. These blood cell regulatory proteins are active in culture and in the body, and they can be used clinically to correct defects in blood cell development.\r"

The NH2-terminus of the leader peptide remains in the cytoplasm and is protected from protease added to the medium outside of the cell.

The analysis of the ploidy of minichromosomes in cells that are released from arrest demonstrates that the sister molecules are properly segregated when the cell cycle block is removed. Therefore, sister minichromosome molecules need not remain topologically interlocked until anaphase in order to be properly segregated, and topological interlocking of sister DNA molecules apparently is not the primary force holding sister chromatids together.\r"

Careful attention to such factors as age, type of operation and anesthesia, underlying pulmonary, hypertensive, cardiac, renal, hepatic, endocrine, and hematologic diseases, and nutritional status can reduce the complication rate and death rate in surgical patients if specific preoperative, operative, and postoperative therapeutic maneuvers are instituted. A comprehensive comparative analysis by the internist, surgeon, and anesthesiologist should be made on all high-risk surgical patients to improve their medical care.\r"

  ".U": "88070976\r", 
  ".W": "Because there is increasing concern about low-back disability and its current medical management, this analysis attempts to construct a new theoretic framework for treatment. Observations of natural history and epidemiology suggest that low-back pain should be a benign, self-limiting condition, that low back-disability as opposed to pain is a relatively recent Western epidemic, and that the role of medicine in that epidemic must be critically examined. The traditional medical model of disease is contrasted with a biopsychosocial model of illness to analyze success and failure in low-back disorders. Studies of the mathematical relationship between the elements of illness in chronic low-back pain suggest that the biopsychosocial concept can be used as an operational model that explains many clinical observations. This model is used to compare rest and active rehabilitation for low-back pain. Rest is the commonest treatment prescribed after analgesics but is based on a doubtful rationale, and there is little evidence of any lasting benefit. There is, however, little doubt about the harmful effects--especially of prolonged bed rest. Conversely, there is no evidence that activity is harmful and, contrary to common belief, it does not necessarily make the pain worse. Experimental studies clearly show that controlled exercises not only restore function, reduce distress and illness behavior, and promote return to work, but actually reduce pain. Clinical studies confirm the value of active rehabilitation in practice. To achieve the goal of treating patients rather than spines, we must approach low-back disability as an illness rather than low-back pain as a purely physical disease. We must distinguish pain as a purely the symptoms and signs of distress and illness behavior from those of physical disease, and nominal from substantive diagnoses. Management must change from a negative philosophy of rest for pain to more active restoration of function. Only a new model and understanding of illness by physicians and patients alike makes real change possible.\r"

In cross-sectional studies of occupationally active populations, the occurrence of various symptoms and signs of back disease may be established. However, recommendations as to what data to gather or how to combine it into meaningful entireties are not yet established. To validate reported sciatic pain by clinical findings, 252 reinforcement workers and 231 painters, all men, 20-64 years of age, were examined by nine tests. In the reinforcement workers exposed to heavy occupational loads the reports of sciatica during the previous month were clearly related to several clinical findings. The tests for restriction and pain on bending forward and sideward gave sensitivity values of 0.36-0.61 and specificity values of 0.82-0.87. Combining the results of the separate tests into pairs enhanced the sensitivity to 0.62-0.68, but reduced the specificity to 0.77-0.78. Referring to the current results, recommendations include a structured inquiry into sciatic pain during the previous month, backed up by clinical tests for range of and pain on lumbar movement, when studying the occurrence of back syndromes in physically heavy trades.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients with cystic neoplasms of the pancreas were seen at four Northern California hospitals between the years 1978 and 1986. Three of the tumors were benign and five were malignant. Three females, whose average age was 61 years, had cystadenomas. Three females and two males, whose average age was 48 years, had mucinous cystadenocarcinomas. Clinical presentations were similar among all patients. Abdominal pain was a prominent feature. Anorexia, weight loss, nausea and vomiting with a palpable abdominal mass were seen in five of eight patients. Obstructive jaundice was seen in two of eight patients. Among patients with benign lesions, one lesion was in the head and two lesions were in the tail of the pancreas. The malignant lesions were in the head of the pancreas in three patients and in the tail or body in two. A presumptive diagnosis was made preoperatively on the basis of the clinical, laboratory and roentgenographic findings in seven of eight patients. Of the patients with benign tumors, two are alive and well at seven years and four months and one patient was lost to follow-up study at four years. Among the patients with a malignant condition who underwent operation, resection for cure was performed upon four patients. One patient died postoperatively and the other three patients are alive and well without evidence of a recurrence at three and one-half, four and four years after resection. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed upon two patients and distal pancreatectomy in another. Palliation was attempted in one critically ill patient with an unresectable tumor by longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy. This procedure was not effective in providing pain relief because of obstruction of the pancreatic duct by the viscous mucoid secretion of the tumor. The preoperative diagnosis of these very rare tumors is usually possible roentgenographically, especially with the use of the computed tomography scan. The presence of a thick mucoid secretion of high viscosity is diagnostic of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas should always be resected, if possible, with the expectation of long term survival.\r"

The infected mice were treated with three doses of gentamicin, cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin alone or else metronidazole or clindamycin in combination with gentamicin. Mice were sacrificed five days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses were determined. Infection induced by a single bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. However, in infections caused by two organisms, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides fragilis (with metronidazole or clindamycin) or Escherichia coli (with gentamicin) was effective in not only significantly reducing the colony forming units (CFU) of the target organism but also reducing the number of untreated bacteria. Clindamycin alone was effective in reducing the CFU of both components of mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis with either Staphylococcus aureus or Group A streptococci. Cefoxitin alone and the combination of either clindamycin or metronidazole with gentamicin were effective against all mixed infections. These data support the need to provide coverage for all components of mixed infections with single or combination therapy.\r"

Nonetheless, the extent and severity of the trauma to the extremity generated on our \"civilian battlefields\" match and often surpass the wounds confronted by our predecessors. In the Civil War, as it had been for many preceeding years, amputation remained the dominant approach to managing a great variety of injuries to the extremities. However, constant surgical progress, as reflected by a gradual reduction in recourse to amputation, had enabled each succeeding generation of surgeons to surpass and distance themselves from their predecessors. Amputation of the traumatized extremity had always defined and continues to represent the prevalent abilities and limitations of conservative and reconstructive surgical efforts. Operative treatment, for much of its existence, represented a collection of dangerous ablative procedures which were used reluctantly when all other measures were exhausted. Its transformation into a successful reconstructive endeavor evolved primarily in this century. The understanding of bone healing and the functional importance of the knee joint led to a transformation in amputation and to changes in the management of fractures which are still evolving. The next revolution in operative treatment came with the ability to restore blood flow in injured extremities. Finally, the recent introduction of a variety of free flaps enables the reconstitution of extensive soft tissue and bony defects and further lowers the number of obligatory amputations. These innovations enabled the surgeon to reduce his or her recourse to amputation of severely injured extremities. Nonetheless, the significant number of amputations still performed constitute a reminder that there is still work to be done.\r"

Beneficial effects of chemotherapy induced amenorrhea was noted in four of five reported adjunctive trials. Chemotherapy appears to delay recurrence but has only minimal effect on survival rates. The results of four of five studies comparing ovarian ablation with controls show a consistent, but modest, prolongation of disease-free survival rates from oophorectomy similar to that observed from adjunctive chemotherapy. The benefits are accomplished with less morbidity from ovarian ablation. Additional trials are needed to prove whether or not chemotherapy is more beneficial than adjunctive ovarian ablation in delaying recurrence and if either prolong survival time. Such trials should compare intensive adjunctive chemotherapy with either minimal or no adjunctive therapies. Therapy to be given at the time of recurrence should be defined at the outset to assure comparable over-all treatment among groups.\r"

  ".W": "Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers University discovered the first aminoglycoside antibiotic, streptomycin, in 1943. Other aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin and tobramycin, soon followed. Tobramycin is compatible with most intravenous fluids and tear substitutes, but it is incompatible with heparin and some beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporins. Due to tobramycin's broad spectrum of activity, it has proven useful in controlling both superficial and deep infections of the eye and ocular adnexa (i.e., blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and endophthalmitis). However, since tobramycin has been associated with neuromuscular blockade, as well as possessing ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects, care must be taken to minimize toxicity by monitoring patients undergoing systemic tobramycin therapy.\r"
