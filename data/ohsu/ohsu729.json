The presence of hypertension in persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with increased rates of the microvascular and macrovascular complications of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. A cross-sectional study of a cohort of 817 diabetic Navajo Indians was performed to determine the age-, sex-, and duration-specific prevalence of diagnosed hypertension. Persons with end-stage renal disease were excluded from the population. A total of 388 of the patients (47.5%) had diagnosed hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension increased with increasing age. Contrary to findings in other populations, women did not have higher rates of hypertension than men. The duration of diabetes did not have a consistent effect on the rates of hypertension. The current prevalence of hypertension among Navajos with diabetes is higher than that reported two decades ago.\r"

  ".W": "From 1971 to 1972 (N = 105) and 1986 to 1987 (N = 160), parenteral drug abusers seropositive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers were screened for antibodies to the hepatitis delta virus (anti-HD). In both time frames anti-HD was independently associated with the hepatitis B surface antigen. It was observed that 31% of those positive for hepatitis B surface antigen from the early sample and 20% of those from the latter sample had detectable anti-HD, as opposed to 10% and 7%, respectively, of those negative for hepatitis B surface antigen. Anti-HD seropositivity was unrelated to gender and ethnicity, and in the 1971 and 1972 nationwide sample, its presence was unrelated to geographic location. The probability of manifesting anti-HD increased with the more HBV markers detected, particularly the number of different HBV antibody markers. We conclude that anti-HD was wide-spread in parenteral drug abusers at least as early as 1971, and that its expression was associated with hepatitis B surface antigen and the intensity of the immune response to HBV as evidenced by the number of different circulating HBV antibodies.\r"

We therefore studied diurnal variations in AER in type I diabetics with normal AER (n = 16) and incipient (n = 12) and clinical (defined as persistent AER greater than 200 micrograms/min) nephropathy (n = 12), and in healthy controls (n = 24). In all groups AER was lowest at night. In some patients of all groups, marked diurnal variations were observed. Twenty-four-hour urine collections classified all patients correctly. Overnight urine collections, however, misclassified patients with incipient nephropathy as having normal AER in 4 of 12, 7 of 12, or 3 of 7 cases, depending on which cutoff level was used. We conclude that 24-hour urine collections are more sensitive than overnight samples in identifying patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy.\r"

Seventy-four physicians (38 house staff and 36 attending physicians) were surveyed from four sites in Pittsburgh, Pa, regarding their agreement with recommendations of the American Cancer Society and the Canadian Task Force. Two hundred fifty patients were interviewed and their charts were reviewed for performance of the recommendations. In all patients, physicians agreed highly with the American Cancer Society and the Canadian Task Force recommendations (agreement, 80% to 100%), with the exception of proctoscopy and thyroid examinations. Physicians performed screening procedures much less frequently. House staff and attending physicians differed regarding their attitudes about prevention. House staff felt the need for more formal instruction and were more positive regarding a healthy life-style and commitment to health promotion. The significant predictors of tests (defined as either examination or test ordered by a physician) were presence of a checklist, site of practice, and physician status. A logistic regression analysis was performed; however, this model could not entirely explain the variations found. Although physicians agreed with recommendations for screening, the attending physicians and house staff (particularly attending physicians) were less likely to perform the screening, especially in the elderly.\r"

Three epidemiologic studies in which nationally representative samples of US adults were interviewed about their drinking practices and problems provide some data on this issue. Analyses of data from these three studies (conducted in 1967, 1979, and 1984) indicate that multiple alcohol problems and at least one occasion of recent heavy alcohol consumption have increased over time in the general population. At the same time, the probability of a physician recommending reduction in drinking declined for both males and females. When only male subjects with multiple alcohol problems were considered, physician recommendations to reduce drinking did not decline significantly between 1967 and 1984. However, the sharp decline over time in physician's medical advice to female subjects with multiple alcohol problems was statistically significant. Similar results were found for physician attention to drinking among the more inclusive group of subjects with at least one recent occasion of heavy drinking. Implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Twenty-six patients hospitalized with bronchoscopy-proved P carinii pneumonia were studied. Nineteen patients survived their episode of P carinii pneumonia, while 7 subjects did not. The only clinical factor associated with mortality was a history of a shorter duration of pulmonary symptoms. Univariate analysis showed decreased total CD8 cell count, total lymphocyte count, serum hemoglobin, serum albumin, total thyroxine, and total triiodothyronine values consistent with a poor outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the single best prognostic indicator of acute mortality appeared to be a total serum triiodothyronine value less than 0.70 nmol/L obtained early in the hospital course, and that the combination of serum triiodothyronine and hemoglobin values provided a better indication for survival. These preliminary observations would appear to justify the further exploration of serial serum triiodothyronine measurements as a potentially valuable prognostic indicator for the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infected with P carinii and possibly other intercurrent infectious illnesses.\r"

Eleven patients with septic encephalopathy were compared with nine patients with septic encephalopathy and nine normal controls with respect to blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amino acid profile, phenylethylamine and its metabolite phenylacetic acid, and blood ammonia. Blood and CSF levels of phenylacetic acid increased markedly in septic and hepatic encephalopathy while CSF phenylethylamine levels were not increased in either condition, presumably due to rapid turnover. The CSF concentrations of all the aromatic amino acids were increased in hepatic encephalopathy, whereas in the patients with sepsis, only phenylalanine levels were increased. Evidence of stimulated neutral amino acid transport into brain was demonstrated in hepatic not septic encephalopathy and appeared to correlate with the CSF glutamine concentration. Blood ammonia levels were increased in hepatic but not in septic encephalopathy. Our data support the hypothesis that metabolites of phenylethylamine contribute to encephalopathy in systemic sepsis and hepatic failure; however, the entities differ in other respects.\r"

Postoperatively, the symptoms were relieved, when present, and the digital changes were stabilized.

Growth hormone secretion was measured during electroencephalographically monitored sleep in 38 patients with a recurrent major depressive disorder and 35 healthy control subjects. Before treatment, depressed patients had a statistically significant reduction in growth hormone secretion during sleep. This reduction, which persisted through treatment and recovery into the drug-free remitted state, may be a trait marker in patients with a recurrent depressive disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The functional status of platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors in patients with major depression has been assessed by simultaneously measuring both a biochemical mechanism of transduction of receptor activation (inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity) and a physiologic response of the receptor (induction of aggregation). The inhibitory effects induced by epinephrine and UK 14304 on adenylate cyclase activity were unchanged, while the aggregation responses induced by the same alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists were potentiated, which indicated receptor supersensitivity. In depressed (n = 30) and euthymic (n = 11) patients as well as in control subjects (n = 66), there was a clear dissociation between inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and induction of aggregation, indicating that the two responses represent different phenomena of alpha 2-adrenoceptor activation. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor-mediated platelet aggregation could represent a better marker than inhibition of adenylate cyclase to assess functional changes of the receptor in depression. Both of these functional responses are desensitized after long-term antidepressant treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years the dopamine hypothesis has failed to explain the complexities of schizophrenia. Because both negative symptoms and noradrenergic activity appear to increase with psychotic relapse, we studied negative symptoms, psychosis, cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine, and cerebrospinal fluid monoamine metabolites in 32 male patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia while both receiving and not receiving long-term haloperidol treatment. Drug-free cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels correlated significantly with the severity of negative symptoms and psychosis ratings. When the patients were divided into those who did and did not relapse while not receiving the drug, significant positive correlations between negative symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol were observed only in the patients who relapsed. Non significant but negative correlations were observed between the same variables in the nonrelapsers. Thus, increased norepinephrine activity in drug-free patients is associated with intensification of schizophrenic symptoms without necessarily causing the symptoms.\r"

Despite numerous attempts at characterizing the behavior of schizophrenics in the presence of distractors, evidence of increased distractibility has been equivocal due to the difficulty of assessing simultaneously the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of distracting stimuli. We report the results of an experiment in which event-related potential and performance measures were used to assess distractibility during reaction time tasks under different distracting conditions. The results supported the view of an increased distractibility in schizophrenic patients. Event-related potential data suggested that in schizophrenic patients, a reduced amount of processing resources is allocated to process external stimuli and attention is abnormally apportioned to task-irrelevant vs task-relevant stimuli.\r"

It is strongly focused on the use of resources and the end product, and is closely related to marketing. The pathologist's product is information, and the practice of anatomic pathology is evaluated as a system for producing and effectively communicating information. Our integrated program for QA in surgical pathology, autopsy pathology, and cytopathology recognizes that several discrete elements make up the sequence leading to communication of the diagnostic opinion. These are control and processing of the specimen, accuracy of diagnosis, timely and clear communication, efficiency in production of information, coherence with institutional programs in QA, and relation to licensing and accreditation agencies. Each of these elements may be tested separately and sources of error reduced so that the validity and cost of the pathologist's prediction will ultimately be limited only by the state of the art and not by any failure of the information system. Several components of QA, especially resource utilization by pathologists, are potentially productive areas for operations research.\r"

Only 8 cases (0.05%) from a total of approximately 17,500 autopsies were found. The ages ranged from 1 month to 13 years and predisposing factors included recent surgery, congenital heart disease, in-dwelling venous catheters, sepsis, an arteriovenous malformation, occult malignancy, and prolonged immobility. This study confirms that pulmonary thromboembolism is a diagnosis that must be considered in cases of sudden and unexpected death in the pediatric age group. Its incidence, however, appears to be extremely low even in a relatively high-risk population.\r"

To determine the autopsy rate for nursing homes, we analyzed all deaths occurring in New York State nursing homes from 1980 to 1984. Of 58,985 nursing home deaths, autopsies were performed in only 499 cases (0.8%). In comparison to the general nursing home population, autopsied residents were more likely to be male and never married and less likely to be widowed. Of 110 practicing nursing home physicians surveyed, 19% believed autopsies had little if any value in the nursing home population, whereas 71% saw autopsy as a valuable tool but rarely requested one. Fewer than 1 in 10 physicians routinely discussed autopsies with patients and/or families before death. Perceived obstacles included the emotional lability of patients and families and a lack of financial reimbursement. Concerns over religious objections, funeral delays, and unnecessary mutilation were cited by fewer than one third of respondents. Facilitation of consent, physician education, and cost sharing may all contribute to enhanced rates of autopsies in the future.\r"

The sinusoidal infiltrate was more prominent in zones 1 and 2 and less prominent in zone 3 of the acinus. Erythrocyte inclusions that were confirmed by immunohistochemical methods were seen in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.

This prompted a longitudinal analysis of HPV DNA in archival material from these urogenital lesions. Colorimetric in situ hybridization was used to assay for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 were present throughout the period of follow-up in all the condylomatous lesions, including those identified in the bladder, suggesting a common source of infection and spread. By contrast, HPV type 16 was associated only with the vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia that was identified midway through the period of follow-up, and it was apparently cured by excision of the lesion.\r"

The small cells were monoclonal kappa-positive cells admixed with reactive T and B cells. The large cells reacted solely with anti-lambda antibodies. Dual-color and dual-parameter (surface vs DNA) analysis further showed that the small, kappa-positive cells coexpressed CD5 and were diploid, with an estimated synthetic (S) fraction of 2.2%. The predicted histologic pattern was malignant lymphoma, small lymphocytic. In contrast, the large lambda-positive cells were both hyperdiploid and tetraploid with an estimated S fraction of 18%. On the basis of this multiparametric analysis, the predicted histologic pattern for the latter component was malignant lymphoma, diffuse large-cell type. Subsequent histologic examination confirmed the predicted pattern in both cases.\r"

Using multiple linear regression analysis, only the stage of renal dysfunction was significantly predictive of the density of BMHs, but both variables were simultaneously predictive for the stage of polycystic liver disease. On serial sections, 41.4% of cysts were connected to BMHs and 81.0% of BMHs to portal tracts. Bile-like material was found in 10.7% of BMHs. Flat or polypoid hyperplasia of the epithelium was observed in 2.7% of cysts. These results support the long-maintained view that hepatic cysts in ADPKD result from cystic dilatation of BMHs. They indicate, however, that the number of BMHs increases during life. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that hepatic and renal cysts in ADPKD have similar pathogeneses, that BMHs and hepatic cysts result from hyperplasia of the bile duct epithelium, and that as they grow, the hepatic cysts become disconnected from the biliary ducts from which they are derived.\r"

This illustrates an area where flow cytometric studies do not extend tumor detection. In 56 fluids from 48 patients, cytologic methods revealed no malignant cells but flow cytometry distinguished aneuploid cell populations; additional clinical information allowed the identification of malignant tumors in 24 (50%) of these patients.

Increased screening values for glucose were associated with a 70% incidence of diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance when subsequent oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Confirmatory testing with the oral glucose tolerance test was equivalent in cost and superior in diagnostic yield to repeated fasting glucose determination. Nonetheless, preferential use by clinicians of repeated glucose determination was found to contribute to underdiagnosis. Hemoglobin A1c could not reliably predict impaired or diabetic glucose tolerance. We conclude that maximal value of screening for diabetes mellitus is achieved only by obligatory confirmatory oral glucose tolerance testing.\r"

The upper extremity response of the subject was analyzed to find the reliability and discriminating power measures that quantify speed, coordination, and steadiness of the upper extremity response during the tracking task. Results show that reliability of the measures, although variable across the populations tested, is generally high (greater than 0.7). The speed and coordination measures derived from phase-plane analysis are more discriminating than the measures of step-response analysis for the populations tested. Some of the measures may be useful for monitoring patient performance, the other measures can be potentially helpful in diagnosis of the disorders.\r"

In this study, five posttrauma, fully rehabilitated, complete paraplegic adult men walked using their ParaWalkers both without and with electrical stimulation augmentation. Oxygen consumption and distance covered during the test period were monitored to derive speed (m s-1), energy cost (J kg-1 m-1), and energy consumption (J kg-1 s-1). With the ParaWalker-electrical stimulation \"hybrid\" orthosis, three subjects increased their walking speed (10.92%, 7.85%, and 9.27%) and two reduced it (4.49% and 9.36%). Energy cost was reduced in four subjects (6.47%, 7.93%, 6.92%, and 7.97%) but remained the same for the fifth. Energy consumption was reduced in four subjects (0.82%, 11.06%, 0.38%, and 10.28%) and increased in one subject (4.19%). Results were better than those in a previous study of paraplegic locomotion using functional electrical stimulation and long-leg braces. Although electrical stimulation augmentation yields only a small reduction in energy cost, its long-term physiologic effect could be significant in increasing the aerobic-anaerobic threshold of an individual via recruitment of large muscles like the gluteus maximus and medius, thereby increasing performance in a sustained activity like walking.\r"

  ".W": "Many acute spinal cord injury (SCI) patients require rehospitalization after discharge from initial rehabilitation. Previous studies of rehospitalization for these patients have been cross-sectional with respect to time since injury (in years), and have not allowed for comparison of patients with equal exposure to the risk of medical complications once they have reentered the community. To examine the incidence, cause, and monetary cost of rehospitalizations during the first year after discharge from initial rehabilitative care (day 365), the medical records of 88 consecutive, acute SCI patients who completed initial rehabilitation at a regional model SCI care system were reviewed. Cases were excluded from the study if the patient was lost to follow-up before day 365. All readmissions to the regional SCI care system during the follow-up period were reviewed for primary diagnosis, length of stay (LOS), and hospital charges incurred. Thirty-four patients (39%) were readmitted at least once by day 365. There was a total of 47 readmissions; mean LOS was 11.9 +/- 2.1 days per admission (+/- 1SE), and mean hospital charge per admission was $9,683. Univariate comparisons between the characteristics of patients who were readmitted vs those who were not indicated that the readmitted group was less educated (11.8 +/- 2.1 years vs 12.9 +/- 0.3 years, p less than 0.05) and had a substantially longer initial rehabilitation LOS (88.9 +/- 6.6 days vs 72.9 +/- 5.1 days, p less than 0.05). Readmissions were less common among patients who were discharged at Frankel class C or D (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that prostheses improve the forward reach of sitting lower-limb amputees was tested. While sitting with only ischial support, ten unilateral below-knee (BK) amputees could reach farther when they wore their prostheses than when they did not, when reaching at 45 degrees toward or away from the side of the amputation, with mean differences (+/- 1 SD) of 10.7cm (+/- 6.9, p less than 0.0001) and 4.4cm (+/- 4.1, p less than 0.01), respectively. With ten unilateral above-knee (AK) amputees, the differences were not statistically significant. Seven bilateral amputees (mixed levels) were able to reach farther with their prostheses on than off, with mean differences of 41.2cm (+/- 9.5) and 31.5cm (+/- 7.9) for reaches at 0 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively (p less than 0.0001). With the prostheses off, their reach was significantly greater when their thighs were supported than when they were sitting with only ischial support. These findings suggest that (1) prostheses improve the anterolateral reach of unilateral BK amputees, and the straight forward and anterolateral reach of bilateral amputees; (2) when prostheses are not being worn, a sitting surface which provides support through the residual limbs improves forward reach; and (3) the design of AK prostheses should reflect the patient's needs, both standing and sitting.\r"

Patient ratings of satisfaction with treatment were assessed one month after treatment. Multivariate analyses revealed that extent of agreement with the videotape content was significantly associated with lower pain ratings, increased ratings of physical ability, and higher treatment satisfaction. Prognostic use of this procedure for identifying patients at risk for nonadherence to treatment is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Driving after brain damage is a vital issue, considering the large number of patients who suffer from cerebrovascular and traumatic encephalopathy. The ability to operate a motor vehicle is an integral part of independence for most adults and so should be preserved whenever possible. The physician may estimate a patient's ability to drive safely based on his own examination, the evaluation of a neuropsychologist, and a comprehensive driving evaluation--testing, driving simulation, behind-the-wheel observation--with a driving specialist. This study sought to evaluate the ability of brain-damaged individuals to operate a motor vehicle safely at follow-up. These patients had been evaluated (by a physician, a neuropsychologist, and a driving specialist) and were judged able to operate a motor vehicle safely after their cognitive insult. Twenty-two brain-damaged patients who were evaluated at our institution were successfully followed up to five years (mean interval of 2.67 years). Patients were interviewed by telephone. Their driving safely was compared with a control group consisting of a close friend or spouse of each patient. Statistical analysis revealed no difference between patient and control groups in the type of driving, the incidence of speeding tickets, near accidents, and accidents, and the cost of vehicle damage when accidents occurred. The patient group was further divided into those who had, and those who had not experienced driving difficulties so that initial neuropsychologic testing could be compared. No significant differences were noted in any aspect of the neuropsychologic test battery. We conclude that selected brain-damaged patients who have passed a comprehensive driving assessment as outlined were as fit to drive as were their normal matched controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies of the healthy elderly indicate that accidental falls account for many lengthy hospital stays and permanent disabilities. An ongoing investigation by our group is examining the contribution of neuromuscular feedback and the possible substitution of visual-perceptual feedback as a major contributor to falling in this population. This combination of decreased weighting of neuromuscular factors and increased weighting of the visual-perceptual factors led to the following hypothesis: Those persons who cannot see should show less change in frequency of falling as they age than sighted cohorts. The deaf, who rely more than others on visual perceptual stimuli, are less likely to fall as they age than the general elderly population, who first begin to rely more heavily on visual stimuli when they age. Thus, the deaf and blind constitute a population whose change in frequency of falls with increased age should differ markedly from change in the frequency of falls among the nonblind and nondeaf segments of the population. Our results support the hypothesis. The blind demonstrated a higher rate of falls than the deaf or nonimpaired population. However, the more elderly blind failed to show the increase in falling demonstrated by the deaf and nonimpaired. If these findings are confirmed in subsequent studies, the nonimpaired and deaf elderly could be trained to focus on visual feedback. The blind may be able to reduce the frequency of falls by enhancing musculoskeletal feedback and strength via exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of circuit training on blood pressure (BP) and strength were evaluated for six months in 16 middle-aged (means = 55.8 years) men in a metropolitan cardiac rehabilitation program. Circuit training consisted of 12 to 20 repetitions at 30% to 40% of one repetition maximum on 12 Nautilus exercises with one-minute rests between exercises. This strength conditioning was supplemental to the patients' aerobic exercise. Five of the patients had myocardial infarctions, six had coronary artery bypass grafts, two had ventricular arrhythmias, one had angioplasty, and two had a complex of other cardiac conditions. Average height, weight, and body fat for the 16 patients were 179.3 cm, 82.4 kg, and 24.6%, respectively. Blood pressure (BP) data indicated no change in mean systolic or diastolic values during actual circuit training sessions (initial = 122/77 mmHg, mid = 124/78 mmHg, end = 122/76 mmHg). These data were compared with corresponding sets of BP at three and six months of training and no significant differences were seen. In no instance did circuit training appear to elevate a patient's BP above clinically acceptable levels for controlled hypertension. In the six months, significant increases in strength were observed with a mean increment of 8.2 kg or 22% for all 12 exercises. No changes occurred in body weight or percentage of fat. For selected patients in cardiac rehabilitation programs, a carefully supervised, long-term program of low-resistance strength training appears to be safe with regard to BP response, and beneficial in terms of strength gain.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the circulatory and metabolic responses of arm crank ergometer (ACE) exercise to those of wheelchair ergometer (WCE) exercise during maximal and submaximal intensities. Maximal intensity exercise was defined as the highest power output (PO) achieved on each ergometer. The submaximal responses were compared at an equivalent absolute (PO = 25W) and relative (66% peak oxygen uptake [VO2]) intensity. On separate days and in random sequence, nine untrained able-bodied women performed a discontinuous incremental test for peak VO2 using either ACE or WCE. Each exercise bout was approximately six minutes, interspersed with four-minute rest periods. VO2 and heart rate (HR) were measured during each stage of the test and blood lactate concentrations were measured five minutes postexercise. Peak PO, ventilation (VE), and HR were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) on the ACE, with no significant difference in peak VO2 or postexercise blood lactate concentration. When compared at equivalent submaximal PO levels (25W), VO2, VE, and HR were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) on the WCE than on the ACE. In contrast, ACE exercise elicited a higher PO (p less than 0.05) at an equivalent relative metabolic load (66% peak VO2). These results suggest that in women wheelchair ergometry is less metabolically efficient than arm crank ergometry at submaximal exercise intensities. However, at maximal intensity exercise, ACE exercise imposes greater central circulatory stress. The finding that a higher peak HR was elicited by the ACE than the WCE suggests that exercise testing needs to be ergometer-specific when the results are to be used for exercise prescription.\r"

The predominant Wolfe pattern on mammography was P2 (38%); however, no relationship was observed between the Wolfe pattern and malignancy. A marked correlation was observed between malignancy and small lesions, more than 15 calcifications, and calcifications in a linear or branching pattern. Twenty-four percent (n = 67) of the biopsy specimens contained either ductal or lobular breast cancer.

An additional 11 small tumors were evaluated by immunocytochemical assay alone and results were interpretable based on our prior data.

Seven of 46 were estrogen positive while results from the dextran-coated charcoal method were estrogen negative. One of 46 was estrogen negative, while the results from the dextran-coated charcoal method were estrogen positive. Lymph node slide preparations were stained to detect tumor cells using antikeratin monoclonal antibodies. Three of 8 node-negative patients were found to have micrometastases.

The percentage of lymphocytes recovered from the cancer varied widely; that of renal cell carcinoma was higher than that of breast or colon cancer (65% vs 45%), which was higher than that of melanomas or sarcomas (30% to 35%). The types of lymphocytes before and after interleukin 2 activation showed specific patterns. CD4+ helper T cells predominated in all tumors except melanomas, which had more CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. CD16+ natural killer cells were recovered in renal cell carcinoma and sarcomas. Three different cytotoxic lymphocytes were identified among interleukin 2-activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes: (1) CD3+ CD16- cytotoxic T lymphocytes with cytotoxicity restricted to autologous tumor cells in melanomas, (2) CD3-CD16+ natural killer cells with vigorous major histocompatibility complex-nonrestricted cytotoxicity in renal cell carcinoma, and (3) CD3+ CD16- T cells with modest levels of major histocompatibility complex-nonstricted cytotoxicity in all cancers except melanomas. Thus, there was considerable diversity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes among these histologically distinct tumors with respect to magnitude of lymphocyte infiltration, phenotypic expression, and functional capacity.\r"

Only monoclonal antibody FH6 (antisialyl-dimeric Lex) bound more to the metastatic variant compared with HT-29 P. Detergent extracts of human tissues were then assayed for their FH6-binding activity. Normal colonic mucosa displayed less FH6 binding than either Dukes stage B or D primary colon carcinomas. Liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma demonstrated greater binding than stage B and stage D primary tumors, and more than normal liver. Expression of sialyl-dimeric Lex increases as the metastatic potential of colorectal carcinomas increases, and is related to the progression of colorectal cancer.\r"

A retrospective study of 35 patients was undertaken to evaluate the roles of modern mammography, breast preservation, and adjuvant systemic therapy in the management of these patients. Twenty-eight patients underwent a mastectomy, while 7 were managed by a combination of limited resection and/or axillary dissection and radiation therapy. Twenty-two (67%) of the 33 breast specimens contained carcinoma. Comparison of the pathologic results with the preoperative mammograms showed a specificity of 73%, while the sensitivity was only 29%. Actuarial 5-year survival after mastectomy or breast preservation was similar (77% and 65%, respectively). Patients with more than one positive lymph node benefited from adjuvant therapy. Mammography does not locate the majority of occult stage II breast cancers, and both breast preservation and adjuvant therapy may have roles in the management of these patients.\r"

Immunotherapy with the mouse anti-CD3 analogue combined with low-dose interleukin 2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was tested for in vivo antitumor efficacy against established pulmonary metastases from a variety of mouse tumor-cell lines. Administration of a single dose of anti-CD3 followed by low-dose IL-2 and TNF-alpha potentiated reduction of metastases compared with higher doses of IL-2 alone or IL-2 plus TNF-alpha. Treatment with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 plus TNF-alpha significantly prolonged survival and resulted in 60% of the mice achieving long-term survival compared with no survival using single agents or other combinations. The lymphokine-activated killer and natural killer activities of mouse splenocytes increased following treatment with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 plus TNF-alpha. These results indicate that the sequential use of anti-CD3, IL-2, and TNF-alpha for the induction and maintenance of lymphokine-activated killer activity potentiates antitumor activity and provides novel strategies for combination immunotherapy.\r"

Patients underwent scanning 3 to 7 days after infusion by planar and emission computed tomography. ZCE-025 monoclonal antibody imaging detected tumor recurrence or metastasis in 11 of 13 patients. In one patient the monoclonal antibody scan gave a true-negative result, and in one patient the monoclonal antibody scan failed to disclose a metachronous cecal primary. Tumor sites identified were the pelvis (2 patients), abdominal wall (2), retroperitoneum (1), lymph nodes (3); liver (2), bone (2), and lung (1). The accurate localization of colorectal carcinoma recurrences by means of 111In ZCE-025 monoclonal antibody demonstrates the usefulness of this diagnostic agent in the setting of elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level and negative results of clinical and radiologic workup.\r"

Resectability was proved in 16 (29%) of 55 patients for the head of the pancreas, 1 (6%) of 17 for the body and tail of the pancreas, and 14 (88%) of 16 for the ampulla. The combined findings of computed tomography and angiography showed that more than 87% of pancreatic head tumors were unresectable because of vascular encasement, but neither modality sufficed alone. Small liver and peritoneal metastases were found in 15 (27%) of 55 cancers of the head of the pancreas, 11 (65%) of 17 cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas, and 1 (6%) of 16 cancers of the ampulla; computed tomography missed all but 2 of these instances of metastasis, but laparoscopy with biopsy identified 22 (96%) of 23 instances. Magnetic resonance imaging findings did not differ significantly from computed tomography and conferred no added benefit. Ninety percent of unresectable tumors were identified. Seventy-eight percent of pancreatic head cancers were resectable when all test results were negative vs 5% (2/37) when any test result was positive. This study demonstrates that accurate and efficient triage is possible for patients with cancer of the pancreas and ampulla.\r"

Clinical jaundice, tumor stage, and tumor grade were all predictive of patient outcome. DNA ploidy, measured in 70 patients, was not a prognostic indicator. In 36% of patients, cholecystectomy (20%) or radical cholecystectomy (16%), which included adjacent liver and regional lymph node resection, was potentially curative. Median survival for patients undergoing radical procedures was 3.6 years, and survival was 0.8 years for patients following cholecystectomy. The 5-year survival rates were comparable (33% vs 32%). While radical cholecystectomy may benefit individual patients and can be accomplished with low morbidity, there was no overall survival advantage compared with cholecystectomy.\r"

Twenty-one children presented with intussusception. Complete surgical resection of tumor was accomplished in 32 patients, partial resection in 20, and biopsy only in 6. All patients were given lymphoma protocols employing chemotherapy and irradiation. Forty-four (76%) of 58 patients are surviving from 1 year to greater than 20 years from diagnosis. Thirty-one of 32 patients who underwent complete resection followed by protocol management are surviving, compared with 13 of 26 children with residual gross disease.

Therefore, we analyzed 20 clinical and laboratory parameters in 49 patients with acute cholecystitis to determine which factor(s) predicted bactibilla. Twenty-one (42.9%) of 49 patients with pathologically proved acute cholecystitis had positive bile and/or gallbladder wall cultures. Univariate analysis suggested that a preoperative temperature greater than 37.3 degrees C, a total serum bilirubin level greater than 8.6 mumol/L, and a white blood cell count greater than 14.1 x 10(9)/L were the best predictors of bactibilia. Multifactorial analysis demonstrated that the 17 patients with zero or one predictive factor had a significantly lower chance of having bactibilia than the 32 patients with two or three predictive factors (6% vs 63%). We concluded that the culture status of patients with acute cholecystitis can be predicted preoperatively. We propose that patients with acute cholecystitis and zero or one of the predictive factors receive a single preoperative antibiotic dose. In patients with two or three predictive factors, antibiotics should be continued until culture data are available.\r"

The plug is designed to occlude the hernial defect without tension. Several improvements in technique based on extensive experience with this method have been developed. Such repairs result in minimal postoperative discomfort and rapid rehabilitation. This report is based on 1402 operations, with a follow-up of 91% of the patients. There were 1276 patients who were followed up for 3 to 21 years and the recurrence rate was 1.6%. The plug repair for most recurrent inguinal hernias is recommended.\r"

An embolic phenomenon from the internal carotid artery or from the heart explained the infarct in 17 patients (63%). Anterior cerebral artery occlusion without a potential source of embolism was found only in one Vietnamese patient. Neurologic features correlated well with the topography and size of infarct, including hemiparesis, hemihypesthesia, mutism at onset, transcortical motor aphasia, conflictual tasks impairment, mood disturbances, and, more uncommonly, incontinence, grasp reflex, hemineglect, acute confusional state, and unilateral left apraxia. These findings suggest that the etiologic spectrum of anterior cerebral artery infarcts is the same as that of middle cerebral artery infarcts.\r"

We present the correlates between LA severity on magnetic resonance imaging and mental deterioration in a selected sample of 41 elderly patients with vascular risk factors. We found that LA was related to performance on tasks measuring the speed of information processing and, in particular, on those that involve complex processes. This impairment can be important in producing reduction in daily living activities as it is in the support to the relationship found with some commonly used behavioral rating scales. Leuko-araiosis is also related to the presence of some primitive reflexes, suggesting that their disinhibition may be due to diffuse corticofugal fibers damage.\r"

Seizures occurred in 44 patients (4.4%; SE, 0.7%), including 10 (15.4%) of 65 (SE, 4.5%) with lobar or extensive hemorrhage, 6 (8.5%) of 71 (SE, 3.3%) with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 24 (6.5%) of 370 (SE, 1.3%) with cortical infarction, and 4 (3.7%) of 109 (SE, 1.8%) with hemispheric transient ischemic attacks. Lacunar infarcts and deep hemorrhages were not associated with seizures. Arteriovenous malformation was a common cause of lobar hemorrhage with early seizures, but in cortical infarcts there was no association between seizure occurrence and pathogenesis. Seizures generally occurred within 48 hours of stroke onset, were usually single, partial, and readily controlled. Seizures were not associated with a higher mortality or worse functional outcome.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the role of leuko-araiosis observed on computed tomographic imaging among normal populations, 37 neurologically and cognitively normal volunteers ages 18 to 88 years were studied. Local cerebral blood flow was measured using stable xenon-enhanced computed tomography. Severity of leuko-araiosis and cerebral atrophy were graded on computed tomographic images. Leuko-araiosis was observed in 21.6% of normal volunteers, in 52.2% of patients with multi-infarct dementia (n = 23), and in 61.5% of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (n = 13). When multiple regression analysis was applied among normal volunteers, the degree of cerebral atrophy, advancing age, and local cerebral blood flow reductions of subcortical white matter correlated and contributed in that order of precedence to the presence and severity of leuko-araiosis. Combination of the unusual vascular anatomy of periventricular white matter together with cerebral hypoperfusion appears to be related to the occurrence of leuko-araiosis observed among neurologically and cognitively normal subjects. Further investigations should determine whether leuko-araiosis among this population is a risk factor for later cognitive impairments.\r"

We have analyzed brain amino compounds of these patients and found a decrease of aspartic acid and glutamic acid in the cerebellar cortex and of aspartic acid in the inferior olives. The cell density analysis revealed decreased cell counts, with a mean of 34% of olivary cells and 42% of Purkinje cells surviving when compared with 10 control brains. The cell counts were then correlated with the amino acid analyses. The correlation coefficient for aspartic acid content and surviving neurons in the inferior olive was .87 and that for aspartic acid content and Purkinje cell density was .86. Comparison of glutamic acid content and Purkinje cell density yielded a correlation coefficient of .75. The correlations appear to indicate a relationship between these particular cells or the area they occupy and the decreased content of the two amino acids.\r"

When compared with normal values, mean cerebral glucose metabolism was drastically decreased (+/- 50%) in vegetative subjects, and to a lesser degree (+/- 25%) in conscious patients. The most consistent regional alterations were found in the parieto-occipital cortex (9 cases), the frontier between vertebral and carotid arterial territories, followed by the frontomesial junction (5 cases), the striatum (3 cases with dystonia), thalamus (2 cases), and visual cortex (2 cases with cortical blindness). These data suggest that brain anoxia can result in global brain hypometabolism, which appears related to the vigilance state, as well as in regional alterations preferentially located in arterial border zones.\r"

The middle frontal and temporal cortex, prosubiculum and entorhinal cortex of the hippocampus, substantia nigra, thalamus, amygdala, and caudate were examined. Demented patients with major depression exhibited a 10-fold to 20-fold reduction in the level of norepinephrine in the cortex, along with relative preservation of choline acetyltransferase activity in subcortical regions, compared with demented patients who were not depressed. Serotonin levels were reduced in all eight brain regions, but the reduction did not reach statistical significance in any region examined. A para-doxical increase in dopamine levels was observed in the entorhinal cortex of depressed, demented patients, although no consistent pattern of change in the level of this neurotransmitter emerged across brain regions. Our results indicate that the development of major depression in primary dementia is associated with a profile of concurrent neurochemical changes that is largely consistent with existing neurochemical hypotheses of idiopathic affective disorders, and qualitatively distinct from that associated with primary dementia.\r"

One example of Tolstoy's attention to detail is the description of the death of Prince Nicholas Bolkonski in War and Peace. The information provided in War and Peace allows the identification of the prince's terminal illness as a brain-stem stroke and is probably the first description of the one-and-a-half syndrome. Prince Bolkonski is also portrayed as suffering from a dementing process. Tolstoy used the character of Prince Bolkonski to exemplify the rationalistic, Western-influenced aristocracy that dominated Russia at the end of the 18th century. Prince Bolkonski's decline and apoplectic death parallel the fate of Enlightenment thought in Eastern Europe. The clinical detail employed in this case illustrates how Tolstoy used symbolic characters without sacrificing the realism of War and Peace.\r"

Overall photocoagulation alone was successful in eradicating 76% of the tumors, while in 24% of the tumors additional treatment with cryotherapy, plaque radiotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, or enucleation was necessary. In cases where the tumor was less than or equal to 3.0 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in thickness and was confined to the sensory retina, without seeding into the adjacent vitreous, tumor destruction was achieved with photocoagulation. The mean number of photocoagulation sessions needed for complete tumor regression was 2.5. Photocoagulation alone was generally unsuccessful for tumors greater than 4.5 mm in diameter and 2.5 mm in thickness, and supplemental treatment with other modalities was often necessary in such cases. Based on observations in these patients, we point out certain misconceptions regarding photocoagulation of retinoblastomas and define our current indications and contraindications for this treatment modality.\r"

In young diabetics with comparable disease duration (5 to 10 years), postpubertal children had a greater prevalence of retinopathy than those who were not sexually mature. After adjusting for duration of diabetes and sex, the relative odds of having retinopathy in the postpubescent group relative to the prepubescent or pubescent groups was 4.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 15.3). This study suggests that minimal retinopathy in children is not rare and that postpubescent children have a greater prevalence of diabetic retinopathy than do prepubescent children with similar diabetes duration.\r"

We tested 35 subjects in two replications of four conditions: 10- and 20-Hz flicker, and 4- and 10-Hz pattern reversal. Only the even harmonics were recorded. The patients with glaucoma had reduced electroretinogram amplitudes for all measures relative to the normal subjects. Electroretinogram amplitudes of those suspected of having glaucoma were intermediate. The greatest amplitude reductions were for the 10-Hz flicker electroretinogram and the 4-Hz pattern electroretinogram.

Horizontal ovalness or cyclotorsion, oblique insertion of the optic disc, and bean pot disc were more common in the high myopes. In the eyes with high myopia with glaucoma, inferior dominant nerve fiber layer defects, ectopic fiber defects, and multiple nerve fiber layer defects were common. The incidence of superior nerve fiber layer defects or superior-inferior equal nerve fiber layer defects was high in round or vertically oval discs and low in cyclotorted or horizontal oval discs. The oblique insertion of the discs correlated positively with a higher incidence of ectopic defects in high myopic eyes with glaucoma. The incidence of focal type nerve defects is higher in older patients and high myopes with oblique insertion of the optic disc. Atypical shape of the optic disc correlates positively with atypical retinal nerve fiber layer defects in eyes with high-tension glaucoma.\r"

The procedure was performed on an additional 5 patients with superficial keratopathies. Three of those five procedures resulted in a stable and clear optical surface.

High-water content lenses absorb greater quantities of benzalkonium than do low-water content lenses. Hard lenses take up a much smaller quantity of benzalkonium but release between 30% and 60% of total uptake during washout for 24 hours. Fluorosilicone-acrylate polymer lenses adsorb and release the most preservative, while polymethylmethacrylate lenses (Paragon Optical Inc, Mesa, Ariz) adsorb and release the least. The released benzalkonium from either soft or hard lenses is of a sufficient concentration to be at or above the upper limits of safety.\r"

A 5-year-old boy with mucolipidosis IV experienced recurrent episodes of severe ocular pain, tearing, and ipsilateral facial flushing. This was suggestive of reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a syndrome of pain and sympathetic hyperactivity. The examination revealed marked corneal surface irregularities, corresponding to massive accumulations of intracytoplasmic storage material in the epithelium. Episodic pain in patients with mucolipidosis IV is an important symptom, presumably reflecting the distinctive corneal ultrastructural abnormality in this disease.\r"

Tracer dilution rates were decreased by the use of the disposable infusion port or the aphakic model eye; however, 2 minutes of infusion at a 30-inch bottle height dilution was still sufficient to wash out the tracer to less than 5% of the original concentration.\r"

The subretinal fluid completely or partially resorbed in the four eyes that were treated with retinal photocoagulation, but the final visual acuity was poor in all cases. Exudative retinal detachment is a potential complication of central retinal vein occlusion and in this series was associated with a poor visual prognosis.\r"

To investigate whether minor cartilage collagens are arthritogenic, we immunized DBA/1 mice with the pepsin-soluble fractions of type IX or type XI collagen emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. Both collagens were arthritogenic in DBA/1 mice after only 1 injection. However, the incidence of the polyarthritis was lower and the severity was lesser than with that induced by bovine type II collagen, even when a booster injection was administered. All mice developed a humoral response to the immunizing antigen, without any relationship to the arthritic status. Interestingly, competition experiments showed that antibodies raised against type XI collagen also bound with high avidity to type II collagen. In contrast, sera from type IX collagen-immunized mice did not react with either type II or type XI collagen. We conclude that types IX and XI minor cartilage collagens are both arthritogenic and immunogenic in DBA/1 mice. Whether the recognition of epitopes common to different collagens is relevant to the articular pathology remains to be elucidated.\r"

However, these differences were not associated with alterations in the relative formation of the 2-hydroxylated and the 16 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites. The development of overt nephritis was associated with a decrease in estrogen metabolic activity, but not with any alteration in the distribution of estrogen metabolites. Thus, estrogen metabolism was not altered in premorbid (NZB x NZW)F1 mice in a manner that would result in abnormal retention of hormonally active metabolites.\r"

After a 2-week drug washout period, patients received flurbiprofen (200 mg/day) or sustained-release ibuprofen (2,400 mg/day) for a 10-week trial. Clinical response was assessed biweekly using standard clinical parameters, including 50-foot walk time, tender joint score, duration of morning stiffness, and global assessment of disease activity and pain (by both the patient and the physician). Patients were classified as responders if there was greater than or equal to 30% improvement in at least 3 of the 4 clinical measures of disease activity. Thirty patients completed at least 8 weeks of therapy; there were 12 responders and 18 nonresponders. Of the laboratory parameters examined, the responders, but not the nonresponders, demonstrated significant reductions (from postwashout values) in levels of IgM rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein (CRP), along with significant increases in the number of circulating lymphocytes and decreases in the number of circulating granulocytes (P less than or equal to 0.05). In contrast, the nonresponders demonstrated either no change or worsening of the laboratory correlates of disease activity. The responders also appeared to have more aggressive disease at baseline, with significantly more painful joints, greater 50-foot walk times, elevated CRP values, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates (P less than or equal to 0.05). These data suggest that there is a subset of rheumatoid arthritis patients in whom clinical improvement with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy is associated with significant reductions in IgM rheumatoid factor and CRP levels.\r"

Patients with SS were found to have a significantly increased expression of c-myc messenger RNA compared with normal individuals. No abnormal forms of c-myc RNA were detected in the SS patients. DNA analysis did not show deletion, rearrangement, or amplification in the c-myc proto-oncogene. The methylation status of the c-myc gene in patients with SS was found to be comparable with that of the control subjects. Nuclear run-off assays showed increased transcription of the c-myc gene in some patients but normal transcription in others, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms are also involved in the increased c-myc messenger RNA observed in these patients. Two patients with primary SS and B cell lymphomas were found to have normal c-myc expression in their PBMC. These results demonstrate the presence of activated PBMC in patients with primary SS and delineate some of the mechanisms that are involved at the molecular level. We speculate that increased c-myc expression may represent an early permissive event in the progression toward neoplasia in these patients.\r"

The higher magnification and resolution of microfocal radiography permitted the quantitative detection of progressive changes in 4 different features: subchondral sclerosis, the number and size of osteophytes, juxtaarticular radiolucencies, and joint space narrowing. Compared with normal control subjects, subchondral cortical thickness was greater in all patients at entry and showed a variable degree of change over the study period. Osteophytes and juxtaarticular radiolucencies were present in all patients at study entry; by the end of the study, osteophytes had increased in number and area, and juxtaarticular radiolucencies had increased in area, but not in number. At entry, 44% of the patients had joint space narrowing significantly greater than that in the control subjects; by 18 months, this proportion increased to 65%. No correlation was found between subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, juxtaarticular radiolucencies, and joint space narrowing. We conclude that in osteoarthritis of the hand, the bony changes have progressed significantly before the occurrence of radiographically evident joint space narrowing indicative of cartilage thinning.\r"

Exposure to ICF resulted in a significant decrease in mineral resorption, as indicated by the decreased release of 45Ca and a decreased number of osteoclasts in the diaphysis. Conditioned medium (CM) from ICF-exposed periosteum-free cultures (ICF-CM), but not from control cultures (Co-CM), inhibited mineral resorption in fresh bones cultured under control conditions. Co-CM increased, but ICF-CM decreased, the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells in 7-day bone marrow cultures. Direct exposure of bone marrow cultures to ICF yielded the same results. Thus, osteoclastic bone resorption in cartilaginous long bones is inhibited by ICF in vitro. A soluble factor(s) acting on tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive, osteoclast precursor-like cells seems to play a role in this effect.\r"

Iodide clearance from the knee was 3 times greater than that from the wrist. In contrast, radioiodinated serum albumin clearance from the knee was only slightly greater than that from the wrist. Interpreted as respective indices of effective synovial plasma flow and lymphatic drainage, these values indicate that the filtration fraction is normally greater in microvessels of the wrist than in those of the knee. These findings complement the results of companion studies of Starling forces that indicate a higher pressure microvascular bed in the wrist than in the knee.\r"

At the vascular site where proximal filtration ceases and distal reabsorption begins, all forces are theoretically in balance. At this point, the transitional microvascular pressure (TMP) may be estimated from the equation TMP = HPSF + OPP - OPSF. We measured these forces in the shoulders, wrists, and knees of 10 normal dogs, ages 2-10 years. The mean HPSF in the knee was lower than that in the shoulders and significantly lower than that in the wrist. Conversely, the OPSF in the wrist was significantly lower than that in the shoulder or the knee. These factors combined indicate that the microvascular bed in the normal knee has a remarkably low mean TMP (7.9 mm Hg). We also found a strong positive correlation between the age of each dog and the mean oncotic pressure of its SF.\r"

We used a radioimmunoassay to measure SP levels in plasma and synovial fluid samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), Reiter's syndrome (RS), and posttraumatic arthritis, as well as in plasma samples from 13 normal subjects. Plasma SP levels in RS patients exceeded levels in RA and OA patients, which in turn exceeded levels in posttrauma patients and in normal subjects. Synovial fluid SP levels exceeded respective plasma levels for all groups, except in RS patients, in whom the plasma level was not significantly different from that in synovial fluid. SP levels in synovial fluid of RA, OA, and RS patients did not differ significantly from each other, but the level in posttrauma patients was higher than in all other groups (P less than 0.005). These studies demonstrate localized intraarticular SP release, and significant plasma/synovial fluid SP concentration gradients in several forms of arthritis.\r"

In format, content, and operations, Chinese medical journals generally resemble their American counterparts, but they also differ. Their content consists largely of scientific papers (whose format is usually the same as that in the United States), case reports, and review articles. Case series are common, and reports of randomized clinical trials are rare. An estimated 20% of journals routinely include English-language abstracts, and the proportion is increasing. Papers are normally peer reviewed by at least two referees. Authors generally are paid on publication of a paper, and peer reviewers are also paid.

In this study, the severity and nature of injuries to prehospital emergency personnel in King County, Washington are reported. In addition, the types of injuries occurring to defibrillator operators throughout the United States, as voluntarily reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are described. In King County, prehospital emergency personnel reported eight accidental shocks. One individual was admitted to the hospital for 3 days and required lidocaine for premature ventricular contractions. Most injuries were the result of accidental contact with the patient rather than equipment failure, but the most serious case was caused by equipment failure. There were 13 injuries reported to the FDA over a 3 1/2-year period, and most injuries involved a mild shock or burn. Three patients were admitted to the hospital for observation. Two cases involved equipment failure. The rate of injury for paramedics was 1 per 1,700 defibrillatory shocks, and the rate of injury for emergency medical technician-defibrillator personnel was 1 per 1,000 defibrillatory shocks. These rates probably overestimate the real risk. Emphasis on safety and incorporation of safety procedures into resuscitation protocols can make the rate of injury even lower.\r"

Significant protection against d-amphetamine-induced death was afforded by pretreatment with haloperidol (1.0 to 20.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (20.0 to 30.0 mg/kg). Diazepam (5.0 to 10.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of clinically overt seizures but offered no protection against death. Yohimbine (2.5 to 10.0 mg/kg) was ineffective in preventing either seizures or death. When haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) was administered in combination with diazepam (2.0 mg/kg), the incidence of death was no different than if haloperidol were given alone. In combination, haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) and propranolol (10.0 mg/kg) reduced death more than either agent alone. These data support a protective role of haloperidol or propranolol in the treatment of d-amphetamine intoxication and show no protection with diazepam or yohimbine.\r"

The authors studied patients who arrested in the field and did not regain a pulse before their arrival in the ED to determine if any ever leave the hospital neurologically intact. All cardiac arrests in the urban St Louis area that were brought to our facility over a 2 1/2-year period by advanced life support units (excluding all patients with hypothermia, drug overdose, near drowning, and traumatic cardiac arrest) were reviewed. Of 243 such patients 32 (13%) arrived with a pulse. Twenty-three of these patients were admitted and 10 discharged alive, 7 were neurologically intact. Out of 211 patients who arrived without a pulse, 24 (11%) developed a pulse with further resuscitative efforts in the ED. Eighteen of these patients were admitted but only one was discharged neurologically intact. The only survivor in the group without a pulse arrested while en route to the ED. It is concluded that cardiac arrest victims who arrive in the ED without a pulse on arrival or en route have almost no chance of functional recovery.\r"

  ".W": "Dip and read urinalysis is a laboratory test commonly performed by emergency physicians. Although the manufacturer states that the capped vials containing the dipsticks must be closed immediately after removal of a strip, this recommendation may not be followed in a busy emergency department. In a simple, two-part, blinded, and controlled trial the authors found that the reagents for determining leukocyte esterase, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, urobilinogen, bilirubin, and blood showed good reproducibility when fresh dipsticks were compared with dipsticks exposed to room temperature and humidity for 1 to 15 days. In contrast to this, the nitrite portion of the exposed dipsticks showed a rapid and cumulative loss of specificity over time. By the end of a week of exposure, one third of the nitrite tests gave false-positive readings. At the end of a second week, nearly three quarters gave false-positive readings for a specificity of only 28%. It is concluded that the nitrite reagent, in contrast to the other eight reagents on the Chemstrip-9 dipstick (Biodynamics, Indianapolis, IN), rapidly loses accuracy when stored in uncapped vials.\r"

A possible mechanism for this drug reaction is the potentiation of bradykinin with resultant kinin system activation.\r"

Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease represented 50% of all cardiac causes. The second most common etiology was overdose or toxic exposure (21%). Witnessed arrest and an etiology of primary cardiac dysrhythmia for arrest were statistically significant factors related to favorable outcome. Asystole as the initial cardiac rhythm was a negative prognostic indicator. Age, sex, race, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and paramedic response time were not significant prognostic factors for long-term survival.\r"

The most common indication for aortography was a widened mediastinum on chest roentgenogram (83.4%). The aortogram was positive for cardiovascular injury in 19.7% of cases. There were 47 patients with aortic rupture, 15 with subclavian artery disruption, and 1 with traumatic aortic insufficiency. Complications occurred in 1.7% of patients. Two patients sustained groin hematomas and one patient suffered an intimal tear of the ascending aorta from the angiographic catheter. None of the complications required treatment. Aberrant origin of the arch vessels occurred in 0.96% of patients, and ductus diverticulum occurred in 0.64%. There were two false-positive and no false-negative aortograms. It was concluded that thoracic aortography after trauma is accurate and safe.\r"

Midazolam is about two to four times more potent than diazepam. Midazolam has been extensively used for a variety of outpatient procedures, but there has been no documentation of its safety in emergency department patients. The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients receiving midazolam during a 2-year period at the University of Cincinnati Center for Emergency Care. The study population consisted of 389 patients (men 56%; women 44%) with an average age of 33.3 years. Midazolam was used intravenously for sedation before a wide variety of painful procedures and for agitation control. The average dose was 3.86 mg, with a range of 0.5 mg to 20.0 mg. The majority of patients (79.2%) received narcotics or sedative/hypnotic agents in addition to midazolam. There was an overall complication rate of 1.0%. Two patients (0.5%) developed clinically significant respiratory depression after midazolam use. Both patients had also received fentanyl citrate and the respiratory depression was reversed with naloxone. Two patients (0.5%) receiving several other drugs developed short periods of hypotension. There were no apparent long term sequelae. The authors conclude that midazolam can be safely used in the emergency department setting. Careful dosing and titration to the desired clinical effects is mandatory. Patients should be closely monitored to maximize safety.\r"

  ".W": "The findings from a questionnaire prepared by the Association of Professors of Medicine and the Association of American Medical Colleges were published in two reports in 1986 and 1987. These reports assessed the research activities of full-time members of departments of internal medicine in 1982 and 1983. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the data of the earlier reports in order to compare the research activities of women and men who were full-time faculty in departments of medicine during the time period originally surveyed. More than half of the faculty women who responded (52%) were less than 40 years old, compared with 23% of the faculty men. Sixty-seven percent of the women held the rank of instructor or assistant professor, in contrast to 40% of the men holding these ranks. Although the faculty of both genders reported generally the same proportions of time devoted to research, the women researchers with M.D. degrees had significantly less National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant support than did their counterparts who were men. Since this difference may have been a function of age, the authors compared NIH grant support of the faculty men and women with M.D. degrees who were 40-59 years old. Even in this older group, significantly fewer of the faculty women had NIH grant support than did the men (16% versus 30%). Furthermore, the percentage of designated laboratory space was significantly lower among the faculty women, regardless of degree (M.D., M.D./Ph.D., or Ph.D.). Further investigation is warranted to monitor the progress of women attempting to develop their research careers and to assess their overall clinical teaching and administrative roles in departments of medicine.\r"

The results suggest that in ten of the 14 PMPs the students appeared to rely on specific information-gathering strategies in formulating their diagnoses, and that both similarities and differences existed between the levels of emphasis placed by the students and physicians on each of the three processes. In general, the physicians placed greater emphasis on the importance of the history, whereas the students relied more on diagnostic studies. These variations have implications for selecting medical problems for purposes of instruction and evaluation of students.\r"

Moreover, their performance on oncology-related questions was significantly lower than the national average (p less than .001). The curriculum committee thus initiated a review of the oncology content in the curriculum of the school of medicine and implemented a two-year plan in 1984-1986 to improve the perceived deficiencies. During the year the two-year intervention was completed, reevaluation demonstrated evidence that substantial improvement had occurred in oncology performance by the students, relative to their performance in non-oncology subjects (p less than .05) and to the national average. Performance on the non-oncology items was unchanged. The authors conclude that oncology education and performance of the students was significantly improved within two years, after instituting the short-term plan to enhance cancer education in the medical school, the improvement in oncology did not occur at the expense of a reduction in performance in non-oncology subjects, and the improved performance in oncology by the students enhanced their overall performance on the NBME examination.\r"

  ".W": "Many physicians believe that the tasks of postgraduate medical education and faculty development are best carried out by senior physicians trained in the appropriate specialty. However, many also will admit that, as physicians, they have received too little training for such an educational role, and that the practical demands of medical practice, scientific research, and administration make it difficult if not impossible to allocate time to continuing medical education program development, curriculum design for residency training, teacher training, and other key aspects of postgraduate medical education. Many medical disciplines have attempted to alleviate this problem by using nonphysician health-care educational consultants in their training programs. However, little attention has been paid to the possibilities of using such consultants in anesthesiology residency education and faculty development. Such consultants in postgraduate medical education and training programs in anesthesiology could perform a wide variety of functions and roles because they possess skills and technical expertise in teaching, training, curriculum design, evaluation, program planning, and interpersonal communications that faculty members often lack. The successful use of a nonphysician consultant in the Department of Anesthesiology at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is described.\r"

  ".W": "During the last decade, total appropriations for the NIH have grown in current as well as constant dollars. Constant dollar expenditures for indirect costs and research project grants have increased, as also has the number of the latter, while such expenditures for research centers, training, and research contracts have shrunk. The most impressive redistribution in emphasis has been toward traditional research project grants (R01s). The size of the average R01 award, discounted for inflation, has grown at an annual rate of 1.1% during the last decade and 1.3% since fiscal year (FY) 1970; that of the average research program project (P01) has declined over the same periods, after a slight rise in the early 1970s. Factors contributing to the modest rise in the real (constant-dollar) size of the average R01 are explored. The regularity with which current-services-requirements estimates for the NIH exceed inflation reflects real growth in the program, particularly in the category of research project grants; the artifact of basing calculations on the post-rather than pre-\"negotiated\" levels of awards in the \"current\" year; and the extent to which the project periods of awards have been extended. The effect of lengthening project periods is slow to become manifest, but inexorably swells the pool of non-competing awards; decisions in this area undertaken in 1985, and continued at least through FY 1988, could very significantly increase current services requirements in FYs 1991 and 1992.\r"

(1) In the educational realm, he indicates why medical centers must play an expanded role in training primary care physicians, explains the dangers of not doing so, and describes ongoing and proposed approaches and reforms for achieving this goal. (2) In the arena of patient care, he explains why modifying physician reimbursement policies is essential for more physicians to develop careers as generalists. Other more controversial physician payment reform measures and their implications for health care and academic medical centers are discussed; the author urges that benefit to patients always be the first concern of such reforms, even at the expense of more narrowly based interests such as limits in faculty salaries or reduced overages to institutions. (3) Regarding research, he discusses various facets and implications of conflict of interest for biomedical scientists--both the reality of misconduct and the appearance of it--especially as they apply to the growing number and forms of university-industry relationships, and urges that such conflicts be managed within guidelines that clarify expectations and standards in an atmosphere of appropriate disclosure and oversight. He concludes by urging academic medical centers to rise to, rather than avoid, the three challenges he has described.\r"

The author maintains that such intervention was inevitable because academic medical centers have focused only on the educational process and the quality of graduates but have not dealt with the need to shape the output of their training programs to meet national health needs. He challenges the academic medical community to seize the initiative in seeking the difficult-to-find solutions to major issues of medical training or be prepared to yield to the decisions of lawmakers and regulators.\r"

  ".W": "Although the quality of U.S. medical care is at an all-time high, thanks largely to the education and training of American physicians, the nation is in a health care crisis, especially in rural areas and the inner cities. To meet this challenge, change in the education of physicians is required. An important reason for the present crisis is that the selection and education process has encouraged only science- and high-technology-oriented individuals to enter medicine, even though social and behavioral factors are the basis of a majority of today's medical problems. The author realizes that there is little motivation for frequently overburdened faculties and underfunded medical schools to undertake the needed changes; he describes various problems that challenge the existence of the health care system, including the increasing (and well-meaning) involvement in educational matters by legislators and bureaucrats. The author then explores various options for bringing about reform of physician education, including changes in premedical education, in the criteria used for identifying and admitting promising students, and in various aspects of medical education. Such reform could encourage some of the best, brightest, and more broadly educated students to enter the medical profession and could maintain high standards of physician education while fulfilling a public trust and meeting a public need.\r"

In individuals less than 50 years old, a J shaped dose-response association was found with abstainers and heavy alcohol consumers having significantly higher blood pressures than moderate alcohol consumers (1 to 2 beverages per day). In individuals 50 years and older, alcohol was associated with higher blood pressures only at the highest levels of intake (greater than 2 beverages per day). The prevalence of hypertension was similarly affected in each age group. This association between alcohol consumption and blood pressure was independent of several variables that are associated with increased blood pressure such as age, sex, race, smoking, education, Quetelet index, social participation, and physical activity. The population attributable risk for hypertension due to heavy alcohol consumption is 5 to 7% in those greater than 50 years old and 6 to 8% in those less than 50 years old. These data suggest that alcohol consumption is a potentially important risk factor for elevations in blood pressure and hypertension.\r"

In this investigation we have examined the adaptive response of the heart following 5/6 renal ablation. Renal ablated and sham rats were maintained under identical conditions for 6 weeks. Despite the presence of systemic hypertension in renal ablated rats (185 +/- 10 mm Hg, P less than .01), heart weight did not differ from sham. [125I] +/- CYP binding was performed and myocardial norepinephrine (NE) content determined to evaluate myocardial sympathetic neuroeffector mechanisms. Scatchard analysis and 1-isoproterenol competition curves did not reveal a difference in the binding properties of the myocardial beta-receptor. No difference in myocardial NE was found in renal ablated and sham rats. Unexpectedly, 1-isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase was impaired in renal ablated rats (32.6 +/- 6 v 58.6 +/- 5 pmol/mg/min, P less than .01) and the dose response curve shifted to the right. We conclude that despite systemic hypertension an adaptive hypertrophic response was not present in hearts of renal ablated rats; myocardial sympathetic neuroeffector mechanisms are not altered in this model; and impaired stimulation of adenylate cyclase appears to be the result of a post-receptor defect.\r"

Pressor responses to shaker stress were significantly larger in SHR than in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Increased sympathetic nerve responses to shaker stress were also significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. Exaggerated pressor responses in SHR were partly attenuated by adrenalectomy and abolished by clonidine (icv). By contrast, 1-Sar,8-Ile angiotensin II (icv) was ineffective. These findings suggest that in SHR, the alpha-adrenergic system in the brain may contribute to exaggerated pressor responses to shaker stress, but not the brain renin-angiotensin system.\r"

The release of endogenous epinephrine and norepinephrine from the vascular adrenergic neurons by periarterial nerve stimulation was examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The isolated mesenteric vasculatures were prepared, and the epinephrine and norepinephrine release during electrical nerve stimulation was determined as the increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine contents in the vascular perfusate. Epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector. Vasoconstrictor responses and norepinephrine overflow during electrical nerve stimulation were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. The amount of stimulation-evoked epinephrine overflow into the perfusate was also increased in SHR compared to that in WKY, especially at low frequency stimulation. These results suggest that epinephrine could be released from the vascular adrenergic neurons as a cotransmitter of norepinephrine and contribute to increased vascular tone in hypertension.\r"

Therefore, endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were studied in the mesenteric resistance vessels of spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Rings with and without endothelium were suspended in a myograph filled with physiological salt solution at 37 degrees C and aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2; the isometric tension was recorded. Acetylcholine caused relaxations only in rings with endothelium. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, relaxations were impaired and markedly biphasic with an early rapid relaxation followed by a secondary contraction. Indomethacin inhibited the secondary response and augmented the duration of the relaxations induced by acetylcholine in the arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats. These findings suggest that the decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine in mesenteric resistance vessels of the spontaneously hypertensive rat is due to the release of a constrictor prostanoid which partly offsets the response of the vascular smooth muscle to endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s).\r"

Renal function and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were studied in four Yucatan miniature swine (YMS) with established DOCA hypertension prior to and for 3 weeks after surgical renal denervation (RDX). During the first week post-RDX, MAP decreased from 141 /+- 6 to 121 +/- 3 mm Hg (P less than .05), while sodium balance increased from 0.32 +/- 0.05 to 0.95 +/- 0.14 mEq/kg/day (P less than .05). By 3 weeks post-RDX, MAP remained below normotensive levels while sodium balance returned to the pre-RDX value. There was no significant change in potassium or water balance after RDX. Thus, in DOCA-YMS the renal nerves are important in the maintenance of hypertension. The reduction in MAP with RDX in the absence of a natriuresis suggests a role for renal afferent nerve activity.\r"

Diet 1 (High Na, Low K) contained 1.0% Na, 0.36% K and diet 2 (Low Na, High K) contained 0.05% Na, 2.0% K. Half of the rats consuming diets 1 and 2 for 1 week received uni and the other half of sham operation (sham). The rats were followed for another week while consuming the experimental diets. Uni and sham rats on diet 1 showed significant increase in blood pressure (BP) (136 +/- 4 v 126 +/- 3 mm Hg, P less than .05). Uni itself did not alter blood pressure. Body weight and heart rate were unchanged by diet or operation. Kidney weight, renal RNA, protein, RNA/DNA, and protein/DNA increased significantly after uni but the differences were not affected by diet. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were not markedly different among any group of rats suggesting no major renal damage. We conclude that dietary changes of Na-K which cause no obvious renal damage even though BP is elevated moderately do not influence renal growth or compensatory renal growth. Based on RNA, DNA and protein metabolism, the form of growth (hypertrophy or hyperplasia) is also not influenced by renal electrolyte handling.\r"

We and others have previously suggested that the outcome of both conditions may be influenced by more aggressive treatment. We examined a large general medicine outpatient population; 72% were black and 41% were diabetic (95% type II). Decreased renal function, defined as a serum creatinine greater than or equal to mg/dL, developed in 18.1%. A multivariable logistic regression analysis identified glucose control, systolic blood pressure level, and male gender as indicators of decreased renal function. These data suggested that both glucose and blood pressure control may decrease the frequency of impaired renal function. However, when these variables were controlled, blacks still had almost twice the risk for renal dysfunction of whites. The data draw attention to, and elucidate the exceptionally high incidence of renal dysfunction in hypertensive blacks with or without diabetes. Further, they may explain the inordinate numbers of blacks with hypertension requiring dialysis. Prospective trials to test the efficacy of blood pressure and glucose control on the course of renal disease in hypertensive and/or type II diabetic patients are warranted.\r"

For this reason, monitoring the cardiovascular response to therapeutic exercise might be expected to enhance the medical and rehabilitative management of dysvascular amputees. In the present study, 31 amputees with peripheral vascular disease underwent continuous noninvasive dynamic cardiovascular monitoring during an initial physical therapy session. The sample had a mean age of 65 yr. There were 20 females. Twenty patients had unilateral below knee amputation. Fifty-two percent had a preamputation history of cardiac disease and six experienced major cardiovascular complications during rehabilitation. After a mean acute hospitalization of 20 days and a mean rehabilitation stay of 36 days, 11 patients were walking independently and 25 were discharged to home. During the monitored physical therapy session, patients achieved a mean maximum heart rate of 113 beats/min, mean maximum blood pressure of 159/81, mean maximum rate-pressure product of 14,546, and mean percent of age-predicted maximal heart rate of 73%. Seventeen (55%) patients demonstrated abnormalities during the monitored session, four of whom had no prior history of heart disease. These changes consisted predominantly of ST-T segment abnormalities, but also included exercise-induced arrhythmias and decreases in blood pressure. Patients with a history of heart disease demonstrated significantly more abnormalities during the monitored session than did those without a history of heart disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The clinical presentation of IBM has marked similarities to that of chronic polymyositis with proximal greater than distal weakness and muscle wasting more pronounced in the lower than upper extremities. In contrast to polymyositis, however, relatively few individuals report neck flexor weakness or dysphagia. Corticosteroid treatment is usually ineffective. The clinical, histopathologic and electrophysiologic findings in a patient with IBM are presented. Of particular interest in this report is the detailed motor unit recruitment frequency data. A number of previous IBM reports fail to mention specific electrophysiologic data or present evidence suggestive of a possible combined neuropathic and myopathic disease. Recruitment intervals of 150 ms or greater in combination with decreased motor unit duration and amplitudes in the involved muscles imply a myopathic pathophysiology. These findings are discussed in relation to electrophysiologic data from previously reported cases.\r"

There were no significant differences in the mean MBI scores, self-care subscores, mobility subscores, acute lengths of stay or rehabilitation lengths of stay between high and low paraplegic patients. However, low paraplegic patients were more likely to walk than were the high paraplegic patients. Surgical stabilization was performed on 36% of the sample; total MBI scores were similar for surgically stabilized and nonsurgically stabilized patients. High and low thoracic paraplegic patients achieved significant functional gains during rehabilitation. These functional gains occurred in a setting which provided for the vocational, psychosocial and recreational needs of the individual, and which fostered independence, community participation and a return to a healthy and active lifestyle.\r"

Although the effects of different high- and low-frequency filters have been hypothesized, they have been the subject of little study under actual clinical conditions. This investigation showed clinically and statistically (p less than 0.01) significant alterations in both motor and sensory nerve evoked responses produced by modification of filter settings within the range routinely used for recording. As the low-frequency filter was varied from 3 to 20 Hz; large differences were seen in amplitude, area and duration of the compound muscle action potential. When the high-frequency filter was changed from 10 to 2 kHz, the mean amplitude of the sensory nerve action potential decreased by 12% and the mean latency was increased 0.1 ms. We conclude that filter parameters must remain constant when determining normal values and when performing serial studies on any patient. Filter settings should be reported as part of all electro-diagnostic reports and scientific manuscripts.\r"

A prospective comparative study was carried out on 164 stroke patients; 48 hospitalized patients served as controls. Mean motor response times to visual stimuli presented in the left and right visual fields and to centrally presented stimuli were studied. The principle finding was that stroke patients improved significantly in their response times from initial to final evaluation. While at initial assessment they performed significantly more slowly than controls, by final assessment the response times of the two groups did not differ. Visual hemineglect influenced change in response time differentially depending on side of lesion: right hemisphere lesion patients with neglect improved, whereas left hemisphere lesion patients with neglect actually deteriorated. The presence of depression influenced right hemisphere lesion patients' response times and change in response times but it did not have any influence for left hemisphere lesion patients. The findings that response time generally improved during rehabilitation has important implications for the treatment of individuals with brain injury. It will be important to identify therapeutic practices which will be effective in the remediation of response time for all patients. Ultimately the goal of intervening in slow response time is to improve performance of functional activities which are influenced by an individual's ability to respond to visual stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Therapeutic trials often attempt to \"blind\" patient and investigator to the true nature of treatments received, reducing the influences of conscious or subconscious prejudices. In drug trials, this is accomplished with placebo tablets, but blinding in trials of physical treatments is more problematic. This issue arose in a clinical trial of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for patients with chronic low back pain. Several study design features were incorporated to promote blinding: use of sham TENS units visually identical with real units, exclusion of potential subjects with previous TENS experience, avoidance of a crossover design and use of identical visit frequency, instructions and modifications in electrode placement. Subjects were asked not to discuss treatments with the clinicians who performed outcome assessments. Both patients and clinicians were asked to guess actual treatment assignments at the trial's end. Every patient in the true TENS group believed the unit was functioning properly, but the degree of certainty varied. In the sham TENS group, 84% also believed they had functioning units, but their certainty was significantly less than in the active treatment group. Differences in patient perceptions did not affect compliance, as the two groups had similar dropout rates, appointment compliance, days of TENS use and daily duration of TENS use. Clinicians guessed treatments correctly 61% of the time (as opposed to 50% expected by chance), again suggesting partial success in blinding. These efforts at blinding may partly explain the negative trial results for TENS efficacy. We conclude that complete blinding is difficult to achieve because of sensory difference in treatment and unintended communication between patient and examiner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One patient had no detectable laudanosine in CSF, but sampling in this patient was possible for only 30 min. There was no atracurium detectable in the CSF of any patient. We conclude that laudanosine crosses the blood-brain barrier and further study of its central nervous system effects in man is warranted.\r"

Respiratory minute volume and alveolar ventilation decreased and ventilatory rate increased. Systemic arterial pressure decreased (diastolic more than systolic) and heart rate remained unchanged. Cardiac rhythm remained unaltered, except in one volunteer who experienced a single premature atrial contraction. Volunteers stated that the odour of desflurane was not irritating or unpleasant. Exposure to the agent for approximately 90 min resulted in rapid and clear-headed recovery.\r"

In 46 patients the mean percentage collection was 82%. Using personal sampling devices, we found that comprehensive scavenging in paediatric anaesthesia can reduce the average exposure of anaesthetists to about 130 p.p.m. of nitrous oxide.\r"

Measurements of mouth opening were made for up to 10 min after loss of the adductor pollicis twitch and cessation of muscle fasciculations. In 22 patients receiving suxamethonium, a significant (P less than 0.001) reduction in mean mouth opening occurred in the 60 s after loss of twitch and cessation of fasciculations. Mouth opening reductions could last for up to 10 min after the loss of twitch, beyond the return of the twitch. One patient experienced \"masseter spasm\"; he did not develop malignant hyperpyrexia during 2.5 h of isoflurane anaesthesia. Patients receiving vecuronium showed a significant (P less than 0.0006) increase in mouth opening. In 20 subjects, mouth opening was generated with a small (1.67 N) and a larger (4.32 N) force. Proportionally equal reductions in mouth opening were obtained with either force after suxamethonium administration. Relatively equal increases with either force followed vecuronium administration. Isolated masseter spasm is not pathognomonic for malignant hyperpyrexia. If the diagnosis of malignant hyperpyrexia is contemplated, signs of hypermetabolism, such as increases in end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration during constant minute ventilation, should be sought.\r"

This constant is a combination of the terminal elimination half-life (T beta 1/2) and the exponent (s) of the Hill equation and may be used to describe the time course of recovery from neuromuscular block. The constant may be estimated by non-linear curve fitting to f, the effect expressed as fraction of maximal effect, or by linear regression of the logit function of f. The methods were validated using plasma concentration and effect data from seven patients administered atracurium. The two methods utilizing effect data alone yielded values of 4.2 (0.7) min and 4.3 (0.5) min (mean (SEM)), respectively, for T beta s1/2 compared with 4.1 (0.6) min when the constant was calculated using plasma concentration data for T beta 1/2 and curve fitting to the concentration-effect data to determine s. These methods offer an objective measure of the rate of recovery and a means of testing if redistribution or elimination is the primary process in the termination of drug effect.\r"

Patients in the other group were given no priming dose. Lower oesophageal pH was monitored continuously and acid reflux was defined as a decrease in pH to less than 4.0. One patient in each group had acid reflux during the time course of the induction. This study suggests that vecuronium 0.01 mg kg-1 given as a priming dose does not increase the risk of acid reflux into the oesophagus.\r"

The end-point of induction of anaesthesia was inability to open eyes upon command. Dose-response curves were determined for each group with a probit procedure and compared with an isobolographic analysis. Midazolam was found to act in synergism with fentanyl for induction of anaesthesia. Twenty-five percent of the ED50 of fentanyl was required in combination with 23% of the ED50 for midazolam to achieve the ED50 of the combination. This degree of synergism may explain mutual potentiation between opioids and benzodiazepines reported previously.\r"

Immediate recovery, as judged by ability to open eyes and recall date of birth, was significantly more rapid following propofol (P less than 0.001). Similarly, restoration of higher mental function was significantly faster following propofol, measured by choice reaction time and critical flicker fusion threshold.

Intraperitoneal administration of propofol 50 mg kg-1 and thiopentone 25 mg kg-1 produced similar peak behavioural effects of mild sedation and incoordination. However, at these doses propofol afforded a greater degree of protection against pentylenetetrazol than thiopentone and at greater doses both propofol and thiopentone caused marked protection. Both anaesthetics were effective also against electroshock seizures at sedative doses. We conclude that propofol has strong anticonvulsant properties.\r"

A total of EMLA 2 g was applied over four different skin areas, totalling 16 cm2, for 4 h before anaesthesia for a minor surgical procedure. Sampling was carried out before and 4, 8 and 12 h after application. Maximum MetHb values (median = 2.24%) were obtained usually at 8 h and were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than before application (median 1.32%). The plasma concentrations of local anaesthetics were low (maximum values: prilocaine 78 ng ml-1, lignocaine 412 ng ml-1). The activity of erythrocyte MetHb reductase (cytochrome b5 reductase) was analysed. Data from a previously studied group of infants aged 3-12 months were included also. Enzyme activity did not reach adult levels until after the age of 3 months. It showed a good inverse correlation with the maximum MetHb values after application of EMLA. Although the MetHb concentrations in the infants younger than 3 months were small, the enzyme capacity may be overloaded when EMLA is administered at the same time as other MetHb-inducing agents. It is concluded that the use of EMLA should be restricted in this age group.\r"

For nitrogen and argon there was a linear relationship between gas pressure and inhibition of aggregation over the range 15-68 atmospheres absolute (atm abs), whereas helium had a threshold for inhibition of approximately 34 atm abs. The inhibition by all gases was reversible after slow decompression. At pressures greater than 55 atm abs, nitrogen produced less inhibition than helium, indicating anaesthetic-pressure antagonism. Whereas pressure alone and the anaesthetic gases inhibited aggregation, the platelet shape change elicited by ADP was resistant to both nitrogen and helium, indicating that ADP binding and the early events in platelet activation were relatively unaffected by these conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of anorexia nervosa on skin thickness, skin collagen content and bone density were investigated in a cross-sectional study of 36 women with anorexia nervosa with a 4-year median duration of amenorrhoea and compared with a group of 33 women of comparable age without anorexia and with normal periods. The median skin thickness, assessed radiologically, was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) from 0.88 mm in the comparison group to 0.70 mm in the anorectic group and the median collagen content was significantly reduced from 209 micrograms/mm2 in the comparison group to 164 micrograms/mm2 in the anorectic group (P less than 0.05). The median bone density in the comparison group was 0.93 gHA/cm2 at the lumbar spine and 0.84 gHA/cm2 at the proximal femur. These values were greatly reduced in the women with anorexia nervosa to 0.77 gHA/cm2 and 0.65 gHA/cm2 respectively (P less than 0.01). Our findings confirm the loss of bone mass with anorexia and demonstrate the coexistent loss of skin thickness and skin collagen content. This association supports the hypothesis that a generalized loss of collagen is a major factor in the causation of osteoporosis following oestrogen deficiency.\r"

Major complications were extremely rare and genital tract trauma only occurred in 4 (0.17%) and proven pelvic infection in 2 (0.08%) patients. Thirty-three (1.4%) were readmitted and required a surgical evacuation of the uterus. Since long-term complications have been assessed for this method of termination and found to be infrequent, we see no reason to consider a change in methods for second trimester terminations.\r"

Restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA sequencing of the region encompassing the breakpoint show that the deletion starts 3.2 kilobases (kb) upstream from the delta gene and ends within the enhancer region 3' to the beta-globin gene. Here the deletion removes one of the four binding sites for an erythroid specific transcriptional factor (NF-E1). The molecular comparison of the new deletion with others of similar size and location but associated with a delta beta-thalassemia phenotype suggests that the residual enhancer element, relocated near gamma genes, may increase the fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression above the level observed in delta beta-thalassemia.\r"

We find that the proportion of BFU-E sensitive to 3H-dT kill, and hence active in DNA synthesis, was inversely correlated with the percent of peripheral HbF when light density (LD) mononuclear cells were used for plating. Regression analysis showed that the correlation between HbF level and BFU-E kill was highly significant (r = .88; P less than .00003). We confirmed the BPA-like factor(s) production by LD mononuclear cells of SS patients, and found, in addition, that this phenomenon is restricted to the population of SS patients with HbF levels lower than 9%. Circulating BFU-E of patients with high HbF levels are not sensitive to 3H-dT, and their mononuclear cells do not release BPA-like factor. In summary, SS patients exhibit differences in the capacity of their mononuclear cells to produce BPA activity according to their peripheral HbF level, as well as to the DNA synthesis-state of their circulating BFU-E. We conclude that erythroid progenitors differ among SS patients in relation to their peripheral HbF level.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the long term outcome of 197 patients who were treated for grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following histocompatible allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Of 469 recipients of sibling donor allografts performed at our center between January, 1979 and October, 1987, 197 patients (42%) developed greater than or equal to grade II acute GVHD at a median of 38 days (range 9 to 98 days) post-BMT. After treatment with corticosteroids (n = 160) or other immunosuppressive therapies (n = 37), 72 patients (41% +/- 8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]) achieved complete and continuing resolution of acute GVHD after a median of 21 days of therapy. Sixty-one patients required additional immunosuppressive therapy with high dose methylprednisolone, antithymocyte globulin (ATG)/steroids, or other therapies because of refractory or progressive symptoms of acute GVHD. Seven of these 61 patients eventually obtained complete and continuing remission after 13 to 57 days (median 50) of secondary treatment. The overall rate of chronic GVHD was 70% +/- 16%; 95% CI following grade II to IV acute GVHD. Twenty-five of the 197 patients never developed chronic GVHD, resulting in a Kaplan-Meier projection of 30% +/- 8% (95% CI) cure of moderate/severe acute GVHD. Analysis of clinical features associated with complete response (CR) to acute GVHD therapy identified more favorable responses to therapy in patients without either liver or skin involvement, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and donor/recipient pairs other than male patients with female donors. Older recipient age was not associated with more resistance to GVHD treatment. CR to GVHD treatment was associated with significantly better 5-year survival: 51% +/- 14% versus 32% +/- 11% for patients with therapy resistant acute GVHD (P = .004). GVHD was a major contributing cause of death in 49 of the 90 patients who died and was often complicated by infection or interstitial pneumonitis. Control of acute GVHD through immunosuppressive therapy did not affect the risk of leukemic relapse after transplantation.\r"

The patients did not receive a significantly larger inoculum of mature T cells than other recipients of T cell-depleted marrow transplants. All four patients achieved quick engraftment, and three of the four patients are alive and well today. The three living patients have all had a complete return of normal T-cell and B-cell function. Infectious complications in the surviving patients were minimal; however, all three experienced some degree of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Two of these three patients received GVHD prophylaxis. The patient not receiving GVHD prophylaxis experienced severe GVHD and had a difficult posttransplant course. The patient who did not survive was chronically ill before BMT, whereas the other patients were in relatively good health at the time of BMT. Since the majority of individuals with this disease lack a matched bone marrow donor, our results using partially matched donors suggest that a greater number of patients can be successfully treated for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and that outcome is related to control of GVHD and state of health before BMT. Marrow transplantation should be offered earlier in the disease course before the onset of major infectious problems.\r"

Responses were attained in 44 patients (65%, 95% confidence intervals [CI], 52% to 76%), including 37 who achieved complete responses. Fifteen patients (22%, 95% C.I. 13% to 34%) remain free of disease (including 11 continuously) at a median of 5.3 (range 3.1 to 9.1) years later. Higher Karnofsky scores (P less than .01, Mann-Whitney U test) and the absence of a history of prior radiotherapy (P = .02, chi 2 test) were associated with achievement of complete plus partial responses. Higher Karnofsky scores (P less than .01, Mann-Whitney U test) and less resistant disease status at transplantation (P = .04, chi 2 test) were significant when calculations were limited to complete responses. Karnofsky scores were also associated with the probability of freedom from progression (P = .02, log-rank) for responding patients. Also, Karnofsky scores and the absence of prior radiotherapy (P less than .01 and P = .01, respectively, log-rank) were associated with improved survival. Progressive lymphoma was the chief cause of failure; progression usually occurred less than 6 months after transplantation, most often at the sites of active disease before the transplant. However, five patients (including four with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) suffered hematogenous patterns of relapse; four of these five patients had no prior history of marrow involvement. Other causes of mortality included interstitial pneumonitis, sepsis, hemorrhage and renal failure. Intensive chemoradiotherapy and autologous marrow transplantation produces durable remissions in some patients with progressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Since such therapy is more effective when given to patients with signs of less advanced disease, earlier treatment would be the simplest way to produce improved results. However, improved conditioning regimens will also be needed, and measures to reduce occult lymphoma stem cell contamination with the autograft may also be required to increase the likelihood of cure in some patients.\r"

All treatment was stopped after 24 months. Sixty-nine percent of patients achieved a partial response, 11% a minor response, and 3% (one patient) had stable disease. Six patients (17%) did not respond to rIFN-alpha 2a. Two patients (6%) achieved a response but later progressed on treatment. A total of 23 patients completed 2 years of treatment and are evaluable for long-term follow-up at a median of 20 months postcompletion of therapy (range 9 to 32 months). Eleven patients (48%) have had progression of their disease at a median of 10 months (range .5 to 25 months) after treatment was discontinued. Statistical analysis of pretreatment patient characteristics did not reveal any factor(s) associated with a high probability of responding to rIFN-alpha 2a; however, analysis of post-treatment variables measured after 2 years of treatment suggested that a low platelet count was associated with a high rate of disease progression. These findings are compared with other published trials using rIFN-alpha 2b, a similar but not identical rIFN preparation. We conclude that while rIFN-alpha 2a has a high overall response incidence, the rate of disease progression after therapy is discontinued approaches 50%, and that a subset of patients can be identified who are at high risk for recurrence after completing 2 years of treatment.\r"

In this study, we have investigated changes in cell attachment to Fn upon terminal erythroid differentiation. We first purified CFU-E from human marrow by avidin-biotin immune rosetting. This negative selection procedure yielded a cell population containing approximately 80% blasts that, after characterization by colony-assays and electron microscopy, appeared to consist of CFU-E (10% to 15%) and their immediate progeny (85% to 90%), here defined as \"preproerythroblasts.\" In the presence of erythropoietin, purified cells differentiated into reticulocytes in 7 to 10 days. Cell attachment to Fn was inversely correlated to the stage of differentiation of the erythroid cell: more than 50% of the CFU-E population reproducibly adhered to Fn, whereas at most 30% of the preproerythroblasts had the same capacity. Adhesion was further lost at late maturation stages, and a constant finding was the inability of reticulocytes to adhere to Fn. Finally, CFU-E adhesion to Fn was blocked by polyclonal lgG raised against the Fn receptor and by a monoclonal antibody against VLA-5. These results demonstrate that adhesion to Fn is developmentally regulated during normal human erythropoiesis. Restriction of its expression to CFU-E and its first divisions strikingly correlates with the migratory capacity of these cells.\r"

All four MoAbs immunoprecipitate radioiodinated native EPO, and the concentrations of MoAbs required for maximum binding range from 10 nmol/L to 100 nmol/L. Two MoAbs, designated Group I MoAbs, bind to an epitope within the N-terminal 20 amino acids of EPO and also immunoprecipitate sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-denatured EPO. Two other MoAbs (Group II MoAbs) do not immunoprecipitate SDS-denatured EPO and do not bind to any of the eight endo C fragments of EPO. We first used murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells to test the MoAbs for inhibition of EPO-receptor binding. MEL cells, although unresponsive to EPO, express 760 high affinity receptors for EPO per cell (Kd = 0.24 nmol/L). To assay our MoAbs, MEL cells were grown as monolayers on fibronectin-coated Petri dishes and incubated at 4 degrees C with radioiodinated EPO. Group I MoAbs do not inhibit binding of radioiodinated EPO to the MEL EPO-receptor, but Group II MoAbs do inhibit binding in a dose-dependent manner. We next examined the neutralization of EPO bioactivity by our MoAbs, using EPO-dependent cell line. Only Group II MoAbs inhibit a newly developed EPO-dependent cell growth, demonstrating that inhibition of EPO-receptor binding correlates with neutralization of EPO bioactivity.\r"

  ".W": "The platelet fibrinogen receptor, which is composed of glycoproteins IIb (GPIIb) and IIIa (GPIIIa), belongs to a large family of receptors that participate in a multitude of biologically important adhesive interactions. Platelets from most patients with the autosomal recessive bleeding disorder, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, are deficient in GPIIb and GPIIIa. We have used cDNA probes to analyze the GPIIb and GPIIIa genes in four patients from three kindreds with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Southern analysis of their DNA was identical to that observed in normals when probed with a full-length GPIIb cDNA or a 3' GPIIIa cDNA. However, in one family, a 5' 2.0 kb GPIIIa cDNA identified abnormal DNA fragments in the father and two affected siblings' genes. A series of restriction digests resulting in small genomic fragments were probed with portions of the 5' 2.0 kb GPIIIa cDNA and indicated that the abnormal sequences are flanked by normal fragments of the GPIIIa gene. To analyze further the genetic defect in this family, RNA was prepared from their platelets. Northern analysis revealed normal levels of GPIIb mRNA compared to control platelets. We were unable to identify GPIIIa mRNA of any size in the clinically affected family members. We also identified an EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) that permitted carrier status determination in the clinically unaffected siblings. These studies indicate that Glanzmann's thrombasthenia can be caused by heterogeneous defects in the GPIIIa gene. Furthermore, we have shown that platelets can be used to characterize normal and abnormal GPIIIa and GPIIb mRNA, and RFLPs may be used to determine the carrier status in some families with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. The specific gene abnormality in this family appears to represent an example of an insertional mutation resulting in a human disease.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated two major questions related to the molecular basis of interactions between the three-dimensional fibrin network and thrombin-stimulated human platelets. First, what are the roles played by glycoproteins (GP) Ib and IIb:IIIa in linking the fibrin clot tightly to the platelet surface? Second, does von Willebrand factor (vWF) modulate the extent of platelet-fibrin interactions? Quantitative fluorescence microscopy (microfluorimetry) has been used to determine the quantity of fluorescein-labeled fibrin bound to the surface of thrombin-stimulated, gel-filtered platelets (the supernatants of which contained small quantities of vWF) in the presence/absence of receptor-specific and vWF-specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), as well as exogenous vWF. A MoAb specific for the GPIIb:IIIa complex exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of fibrin binding, whereas a MoAb specific for GPIb was ineffective in this regard. Similarly, a MoAb that recognizes the N-terminal region of vWF involved in GPIb binding did not influence fibrin binding. In contrast, a MoAb that binds to a C-terminal region of vWF involved in GPIIb:IIIa recognition caused a specific, concentration-dependent increase in the quantity of platelet-bound fibrin. We also found that exogenous vWF caused a concentration-dependent decrease in fibrin binding. These results support the hypothesis that vWF and fibrin, both of which are multimeric adhesive ligands, compete for occupancy of the GPIIb:IIIa complex on thrombin-stimulated platelets.\r"

We previously reported that treatment of cultured endothelial cells with homocysteine increased endogenous factor V activity by activation of the cofactor. Because endothelial cell-associated factor Va would be regulated by the protein C mechanism, the ability of homocysteine-treated arterial and venous endothelial cells to activate protein C was investigated. Both arterial and venous endothelial cells activated protein C; 0.6 mmol/L homocysteine reduced endothelial cell protein C activation by 12%. Maximal inhibition (90%) of protein C activation occurred with 7.5 to 10 mmol/L homocysteine after 6 to 9 hours of incubation. Metabolism of homocysteine was not accelerated by cultured endothelial cells. Investigation of the mechanism(s) by which homocysteine reduced protein C activation indicated that the metabolite did not induce an inhibitor to activated protein C, but in low concentrations acted as a competitive inhibitor to thrombin. These data suggest that perturbation of the vascular endothelial cell protein C mechanism by homocysteine may contribute to the thrombotic tendency seen in patients with elevated blood levels of this metabolite.\r"

Therefore, the clot-promoting activity of activated Hageman factor might be relatively unimpaired if Hageman factor fragments are also present. Normal C1(-)-inhibitor was cleaved by Hageman factor fragments. Clot-promoting activity was not generated in Hageman factor by exposure to Hageman factor fragments, nor was Hageman factor cleaved by Hageman factor fragments. When Hageman factor was cleaved by streptokinase-activated plasminogen, a 40 Kd fragment was released. In contrast to their interactions with other proteinases, which are blocked by normal C1(-)-inhibitor, Type II C1(-)-inhibitors from plasmas of affected members of eight different kindred with this form of hereditary angioneurotic edema all inhibited the specific coagulant activity of activated Hageman factor to some degree. They did not all form complexes with activated Hageman factor that were stable during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\r"

  ".W": "Two monocyte-derived cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), have been reported to costimulate monocyte-depleted T cell populations in the presence of mitogen, and this effect has been attributed to an accessory function of these molecules. We have now examined further the accessory function potential of IL-1 plus IL-6, and examined how these cytokines promote T cell growth with mitogen. Together, IL-1 and IL-6 additively and, to a small degree, synergistically promote the proliferation of highly purified human peripheral blood T cells with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). However, maximum costimulation by IL-1 plus IL-6 over a wide range of concentrations is significantly smaller than that induced by optimal numbers of monocytes. Also, in contrast to monocytes that costimulate equally effectively T4 positive and T8 positive cells, IL-1 plus IL-6 costimulate T4 positive lymphocytes in marked preference to T8 positive cells. IL-1 plus IL-6 induces IL-2 secretion in T cell cultures costimulated with PHA, and an antibody to the IL-2 receptor, anti-Tac, markedly inhibits PHA-activated T cells costimulated by IL-1 plus IL-6. In addition, IL-1 plus IL-6 enhances the expression of surface IL-2 receptors. Because the costimulatory effect of IL-1 plus IL-6 is quantitatively smaller than that of monocytes, and it is preferentially directed toward T4 positive as opposed to T8 positive T cells, IL-1 plus IL-6, together, appear to represent a selective set of monocyte-derived accessory signals.\r"

We analyzed a panel of 15 T-ALL and 15 T-LL selected for their cell surface expression of the CD3 molecules. The results indicated that TcR gamma delta is more frequently used than TcR alpha beta in T-ALL (10 of the 15 patients tested). This is in contrast to the results obtained with T-LL where the vast majority expressed TcR alpha beta (13 of the 15 patients). These findings suggest that the leukemic cells could have a different origin in these two diseases. In addition, analysis of TcR variable regions expressed by the leukemic blasts showed that, in most cases, they had rearranged functional V delta 1 gene segments (8 of 11 patients), whereas in a unique case V delta 2 gene segment was used. Together, these results and those indicating that T-ALL cells coexpress the CD1a, b, and c molecules strengthen the possibility that although these leukemic cells express the CD3-TcR complex at their cell surface, their normal counterparts are not found in peripheral blood.\r"

After activation, leukemic LGL remained Tac-, with the exception of a patient with CD4+ LGL leukemia. Radiolabeled interleukin-2 (IL-2) binding studies demonstrated that treatment with anti-CD3 MoAb resulted in upregulation of the number of p75 intermediate affinity IL-2 receptor sites per cell. Northern blot hybridization analysis showed expression of gamma-interferon gene transcripts 24 to 48 hours after activation. There was no evidence for expression of IL-2 messenger RNA or secretion of IL-2 after activation. Anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2 provide different signals for activation of CD3+ LGL. Induction of cytotoxicity produced by anti-CD3 MoAb in leukemic CD3+ LGL is not associated with IL-2 production.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, low-molecular-weight B-cell growth factor (LMW-BCGF) has been reported to stimulate growth of leukemic cells from B-cell precursor-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). We further investigated the effects of LMW-BCGF on proliferation of leukemic clonogenic (progenitor) and nonclonogenic (progeny) cells from children with BCP-ALL (28 patients) and B-cell ALL (two patients). Patients were either at diagnosis (n = 18) or in relapse (n = 12). Response of leukemic progenitor cells was determined by culturing cells (10(5) cells/mL) in methylcellulose with 0.1 U/mL LMW-BCGF. Colonies (greater than 20 cells) were counted at day 7. The response of the leukemic progeny population was determined by DNA synthesis studies using tritiated-thymidine and by DNA quantitation with propidiumiodide for determination of cell-cycle status. LMW-BCGF supported growth of leukemic progenitor cells from 20 of 28 (71%) BCP-ALL and two of two B-cell ALL patients. Colony numbers ranged from 7 to 2,400 (mean 145, median 45). A dose-response effect in colony growth was noted, with an apparent plateau at approximately 2.0 U/mL LMW-BCGF. Colony cells were primarily of leukemic phenotype (CD19+/CD10+/-). LMW-BCGF also induced significant increases in leukemic progeny cell proliferation as measured by both thymidine incorporation (stimulation indexes of 1.6 to 34) and by cell-cycle assay (percentage S+ G2/M stimulation indexes of 1.6 to 6). LMW-BCGF was more effective in stimulating leukemic proliferation than three recombinant interleukins (rIL-2, rIL-3, rIL-4), although rIL-3 was able to support colony growth in 4 of 11 patients. These results indicate that LMW-BCGF and, to a lesser degree rIL-3, are able to stimulate proliferation of BCP-ALL progenitor and progeny cells, whereas rIL-2 and rIL-4 do not support progenitor cell proliferation and have only marginal effects on leukemic progeny cell proliferation.\r"

Total RNAs were extracted from diagnostic tissue specimens and submitted to Northern blot analysis, using specific TNF and LT cRNA probes. High amounts of TNF mRNA were found exclusively in NHL (12/35). The majority (9/12) of these were low grade B-cell NHL, which contained a uniform population of malignant cells. In contrast, abundant LT mRNA production was detected in most HL (21/23) and in 19 of 35 NHL. The highest LT mRNA levels were observed in high grade NHL and in lymphocytic predominant subtypes of HL specimens. A significant correlation was found between TNF/cachectin and LT gene expression in NHL and the presence of constitutional symptoms. The biologic and prognostic implications of these preliminary findings are presently unknown, but they demonstrate that lymphoma tissues sharing common histologic features are highly heterogeneous in their ability to synthesize cytokines susceptible to playing a role in the growth control of malignant cells. These results suggest that the evaluation of TNF/cachectin and LT production in lymphomas may help to elucidate the mechanisms of tumoral fever and cachexia.\r"

After an overnight incubation in culture medium of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), we demonstrated the presence of B8.7 antigen in 18 of 25 cases (72%). Such an incubation also induced a significant increase in the LMW BCGF responsiveness of ALL cells (P less than 0.03). In addition, we showed a significant correlation between B8.7 expression and the ability of pre-B ALL cells to respond to LMW BCGF. As previously described for normal B cells, the anti-B8.7 monoclonal antibody inhibited the LMW BCGF-dependent proliferation of pre-B ALL cells in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that B8.7 antigen is expressed and may be functionally related to the LMW BCGF pathway at the pre-B cell stages of differentiation. These results also suggest that human B-cell precursor ALL are not only phenotypically similar to their normal B lymphocyte counterparts, but are also sensitive to the same immunoregulatory cytokines that control normal cell growth.\r"

A gamma-Globin promoter fragments were fused to the neomycin phosphotransferase (neoR) gene in a plasmid-based vector and transiently transfected by electroporation into K562 cells. Correctly initiated \"A gamma-neo\" transcripts were detected with an S1 nuclease protection assay that was internally controlled for transfection efficiency and RNA content. We first optimized the conditions for electroporation, and then determined input DNA concentrations that permitted study of gamma-promoter function in the linear range of the assay. We discovered that a gamma-globin promoter fragment extending from -299 to +36 (with respect to the transcription initiation site) was active in this transient transfection assay, and that the expression of this promoter was increased by the SV40 enhancer. Deletion of the gamma-globin promoter to position -199 did not significantly affect gamma-globin promoter function. However, deletion to -160 reduced gamma promoter strength to 70% that of control, deletion to position -130 to 19% that of control, and deletion to position -61 to 8.7% that of control. Three gamma-globin promoters containing mutations associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (-202 C----G, -196 C----T, and -117 G----A) were not overexpressed in the K562 cell environment, consistent with the hypothesis that these promoters are not overexpressed in fetal erythroblasts, only adult erythroid cells. This system will allow us to further dissect the roles of regulatory globin cis-acting DNA elements in fetal erythroid cells.\r"

In association with the rectal anomaly, three of them had a presacral tumour (teratoma in two, hamartoma in one) and all had a deformed sacrum. An embryological hypothesis to explain this association has been postulated by Currarino, after whom this triad has been named. Two patients were related (father and daughter). The role of hereditary factors in the occurrence of the syndrome has been reported before. Operative treatment of the rectal stenosis was necessary in all patients. Preoperative diverting colostomy was performed in three cases, followed by a posterior sagittal approach to excise the rectal stenosis and the presacral mass. In one case, persistent cerebrospinal fluid leakage required re-exploration for closure of a tear in a congenitally abnormal dural sac. The fourth patient had undergone a low anterior resection in the past via the abdominal route and needed rectal dilatation afterwards for some time. The final result in all patients appears satisfactory, although follow-up is short. Most cases of this triad have been reported in children but a number of patients have been diagnosed only as adults. Recognition of this triad should imply a careful search for neural crest malformations. Operative treatment to correct all soft tissue anomalies leads to good results.\r"

Patients usually have a history of symptoms of less than 6 months prior to bleeding. Adenocarcinoma was the commonest type of tumour, and 74 per cent were stage IV lesions. The proportion of lesions in the body of the stomach (57 per cent) was greater than expected, suggesting that these are different populations of gastric tumour. Laparotomy was undertaken in 20 patients, 12 of whom had a resection. Resection was associated with a median survival of 17.0 months. Those with unresectable tumours or who were treated only by supportive measures had a median survival of only 2.5 months (P less than 0.01). Evidence of peritoneal or liver involvement should contraindicate surgical intervention as these patients have a high postoperative mortality rate.\r"

These methods have been confined to situations and tumour stages otherwise deemed untreatable, or to situations where resection would not have been sufficiently radical. In one patient the ex situ approach avoided the need to undertake liver grafting for a benign tumour. To date, hepatocellular tumours and metastases not compromising global hepatic function or causing cholestasis are considered to be suitable conditions; cholestasis appears to be highly detrimental for the postoperative course after an ex situ procedure. Elaboration of methods for better grading of pre-existing liver damage and of its prognostic significance is essential. The assessment of the final therapeutic value of the described procedure requires further experience.\r"

MTBE was non-contributory in 21 (64 per cent) cases: four passed stones after MTBE was stopped, six were treated by subsequent endoscopic techniques without evidence of dissolution, seven underwent surgery, and four were treated conservatively (with one death). In at least ten of the 21 cases in which MTBE was non-contributory, pigment stones were present. Forty-two complications occurred in 26 (79 per cent) patients. The efficacy of MTBE for treating bile duct stones might be improved by better methods of instillation and, since success may be related to technique, the use of MTBE should be restricted to units familiar with this chemical.\r"

Three patients died as a consequence of pre-existing renal failure, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Patients presenting late with multisystem complications and ongoing sepsis secondary to oesophagopleural fistulae pose a major management problem. Our preliminary results suggest that T tube intubation offers a potential alternative to major surgical intervention, when more conservative measures have failed.\r"

Reflux was controlled in 116 patients (92.1 per cent). One hundred and five patients (83.3 per cent) had a clinically satisfactory result (Visick grades 1 and 2). Poor results were largely due to recurrent reflux, technical failure or the irritable bowel syndrome. An unsatisfactory result was not more likely in those with upright reflux, an oesophageal motility disorder or a competent cardia as defined by manometry. Preoperative oesophageal studies, other than those required to make an accurate diagnosis, were found to have no value in deciding the suitability of patients for surgical correction of gastro-oesophageal reflux.\r"

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and oesophageal manometry were also performed. Thirteen patients with oesophageal symptoms were studied. Eight had dysphagia, and all of these had endoscopies with no evidence of oesophagitis or stricture. Four of these eight subjects had gross delay of oesophageal emptying for fluids, and manometry showed absence of oesophageal peristalsis and incomplete relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. This abnormality is similar to achalasia. Two of these four patients have benefited from pneumatic dilatation with improvement in their severe dysphagia. We believe that pneumatic dilatation should be considered in patients with systemic sclerosis and severe dysphagia where reflux oesophagitis is not apparent.\r"

  ".W": "The experience of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan of 143 patients who underwent extended surgery for cancer of the stomach from 1965 to 1980 is reviewed. They represent 16.3 per cent of the patients who underwent curative surgery. The operative mortality rate was 15.4 per cent but this significantly decreased in recent years to 8 per cent and the morbidity rate to 17.5 per cent. The overall 5-year survival rate was 19 per cent. Survival was analysed according to tumour penetration (pT) and nodal status (N). It was found that patients without tumour penetration of adjacent structures and nodal involvement (pT3N-) had a better 5-year survival rate (21 per cent) than patients with nodal involvement (pT3N+) (2 per cent). Patients with tumour penetration of adjacent structures and without nodal involvement (pT4N-) had a better 5-year survival rate (29 per cent) than patients with nodal involvement (pT4N+) (5 per cent). These differences were significant on log rank test (P less than 0.000001 and P less than 0.001 respectively) and suggest that nodal status is a stronger prognostic variable than pT level. The role of extended surgery is discussed from the viewpoint of the oncological surgeon who has to weigh up the difficulty of a preoperative diagnosis of tumour infiltration of adjacent structures (predictive positive value 0.39), with the operative mortality rate of at least 8 per cent and long-term results which are strongly affected by the nodal status.\r"

During the period 1981-87, 835 melanoma patients were referred and 30 developed complaints caused by gastrointestinal metastatic melanoma. Twenty-three patients were treated surgically. The interval between treatment of the primary melanoma and detection of intestinal involvement was a median of 34 months (range 2-87 months). In four patients recurrence in the gut was the first evidence of dissemination. Major complaints were nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, signs of anaemia, and blood in the stools. Complications were bleeding (ten cases), ileus due to intussusception (five cases), bowel perforation (four cases) and cholecystitis (one case). The metastases, mainly localized in the small bowel, were removed by relatively simple procedures. Symptoms were reduced in 19 patients. Two patients died after operation: one from sepsis due to suture leakage, the other from pneumonia and a cerebrovascular accident. Of the remaining patients, 16 survived a median of 7.5 (range 0.7-32.0) months. Five patients are still alive 72, 72, 70, 7 and 2 months after the metastasectomy, three of whom are tumour-free. The actuarial 5-year survival of all patients is 19 per cent. These results support surgical intervention for patients with complaints and/or complications attributable to gastrointestinal metastatic melanoma.\r"

Of these, 283 (92.2 per cent) were followed up prospectively for a minimum of 5 years. Recurrent ulcer was diagnosed in 49 (17.3 per cent). The recurrent ulcer rate increased from 13.2 per cent at 5 years to 19.4 per cent at 12 years. Age, length of history, previous haemorrhage or perforation and preoperative acid output were not associated with increased risk of recurrent ulceration. The risk in men and smokers was higher but not significantly so. The recurrence rate for individual surgeons varied from 5.3 to 25.6 per cent. Failure of healing with H2-receptor antagonists was not associated with a higher recurrent ulcer rate. Patients with a strong family history (more than one first degree relative affected) had a significantly higher recurrence rate (33.2 per cent at 10 years) than those without (13.5 per cent at 10 years). Of the 49 recurrent ulcer patients, 30 (61.2 per cent) required either an operation or regular H2-receptor antagonists. Of the 250 patients (81.4 per cent) available in 1988 for review of symptoms 5-15 years after operation, 5.4 per cent had dumping, 8.9 per cent epigastric pain, and 11.8 per cent heartburn every day or most days. H2-receptor antagonists were required by 10.7 per cent of patients on a frequent or regular basis. Of 239 patients who answered the question, 218 (91.2 per cent) felt that their symptoms had been cured or greatly improved and 203 (84.9) considered the operation a success. Despite the high recurrence rate, the operation was successful in controlling ulcer symptoms in around 90 per cent of patients and produced postvagotomy symptoms--none severe--in around 5 per cent of patients.\r"

There was no difference on assessment using Visick grading between TVP (59 patients) and HSV (57 patients) (grades I and II, 75 per cent in each case). However, 20 per cent of TVP patients (but none of the HSV patients) had undergone reoperation in the intervening period. The endoscopically proven recurrence rate was 7 per cent after TVP and 5 per cent after HSV. This long-term follow-up supports the optimism that HSV is a better operation than TVP in the elective treatment of duodenal ulcer.\r"

Patients were divided into two categories according to their previous history of dyspepsia; group 1 (66 patients) with a chronic history of more than 3 months and group 2 (47 patients) where there was no history of dyspepsia or a history of less than 3 months duration. The follow-up periods were similar (group 1, 44 months; group 2, 43 months). The overall recurrence rate was 42 per cent and to date only 14 per cent of the total group of 113 patients have required a definitive operation. The incidence of ulcer recurrence was higher in group 1 than in group 2 in terms of total recurrence (group 1, 50 per cent; group 2, 32 per cent) and patients requiring further surgery (group 1, n = 14, 21 per cent; group 2, n = 7, 15 per cent). Five of these 21 patients required an emergency procedure for haemorrhage or reperforation (group 1, n = 2; group 2, n = 3). There were no significant differences between the 5-year predictive recurrence rate or the requirement for definitive surgery between the groups. Five of the 27 patients currently on medical treatment have required maintenance treatment while the remaining patients receive active treatment for a mean of 20 per cent of the time since they developed recurrent ulceration. These results support continuation of our 'wait and see' policy following simple closure of perforated duodenal ulcer, even in patients with a history of chronic dyspepsia.\r"

An air-filled intragastric balloon was used, which was permanently connected to an inflation catheter exiting through the nose. Patients were evaluated for loss of body weight and tolerance of the balloon; the balloon was inspected for efficacy and safety. A mean total loss of body weight of 21 kg was obtained after a mean of 39 weeks in 15 men (mean age 37.7 years) and 45 women (mean age 36.2 years), with a mean initial weight of 127.9 kg. The maximum rate of weight loss occurred in the first 6 months, with a steady decrease of 1 kg per week; thereafter the rate declined. Subjective complaints were infrequent and consisted of nasal discomfort or abdominal symptoms. Intolerance in 12 per cent of patients was due to enhanced hunger (one patient), nasal pulling sensation (four patients) and symptomatic ulcer (two patients). Fifteen patients asked for removal of the well functioning balloon after a mean of 169 days; 14 of the 15 balloons were still airtight. Forty balloons failed prematurely. Nine were retrieved orally and 31 were passed per anum, of which 28 passed with mild abdominal cramping, two patients required transabdominal puncture and one needed laparotomy. Even the 40 prematurely removed balloons remained in situ for a mean of 108 days; only one-third showed leakage. As yet, 33 well functioning balloons have been in situ for a mean of 167 days. Well functioning balloons deflated at a rate of 2.3 ml per day. Malfunctioning of the balloon was due to leakage in 12 cases and to clogging of the inflation catheter in three cases. Major complications (8 per cent) included two gastric ulcers and three cases of mild ileus. One ileus patient required surgery (2 per cent). The reported intragastric balloon model is effective and safe. We recommended this type of balloon as a weight reducing adjuvant therapy before bariatric surgery.\r"

Pancreatic function was examined by the p-aminobenzoic acid/p-aminosalicylic acid (PABA/PAS) test 3-160 months after operation and compared with age- and sex-matched controls. There were no significant differences between mean (s.e.m.) serum PABA concentrations 3 h after ingestion of N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-PABA (25.5 (3.6)) mumol/l for patients, 26.1 (2.0) mumol/l for controls). However, the mean (s.e.m.) PABA excretion index was significantly lower in the patients (0.58 (0.08)) than in the controls (0.76 (0.04)). Four patients required pancreatic enzyme supplements for control of diarrhoea. Self-limiting pancreatic leaks occurred in two patients. The results suggests that the sutureless pancreatico-enteric anastomosis has an acceptably low leakage rate but that pancreatic exocrine function is diminished following pancreaticoduodenectomy with this technique. However, the majority of patients require no enzyme supplements and no significant tendency to late stenosis of the anastomosis was demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 143 consecutive operations for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity, performed by one surgeon over a 5-year period, was studied to determine the place of compartmental excision. The surgical aim was to achieve the nearest to radical surgery compatible with preservation of a functional limb. Of the operations, 73 were for previously untreated primary tumour and 70 for local recurrence. Two tumours arose in areas previously irradiated for other malignancies and 35 recurrences had occurred despite prior radiotherapy; of the 106 remaining cases, adjuvant radiotherapy was used for 79. Adjuvant chemotherapy was used only occasionally and was more often regional than systemic. For the majority of tumours, compartmentectomy was inappropriate or inadequate: 49 were extracompartmental in origin and 48 extended beyond their compartment of origin at the time of surgery. The remaining 46 were confined to one compartment; in only 21 of these 46 operations was a radical compartmental excision performed. Compartmental excision was more likely to be performed when the tumour was centrally located within a compartment, was so large that it replaced most of the muscle group, or was high grade or recurrent (particularly when adjuvant radiotherapy had already been used). The general preference was to combine less-than-radical surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy rather than sacrifice entire muscle groups or adjacent, functionally important, structures such as artery or nerve. This reflects the proven efficacy of radiotherapy in controlling microscopic disease. Overall, compartmental excision was considered appropriate in only 15 per cent of operations.\r"

All patients were sensitized with 2.5 mg kg-1 of haematoporphyrin derivative, 48 h before phototherapy. A standard treatment protocol of light exposure was used. Up to four parts of the tumour were treated with 50J of red light (630 nm) from a tuneable dye laser, through a flexible optical fibre passed through the colonoscope and inserted into the tumour. Two patients with small lesions are tumour-free 20 and 28 months after PDT. One treatment of an advanced tumour was complicated by a haemodynamically significant secondary haemorrhage. PDT may be most suitable for the treatment of small tumours or for small areas of persistent tumour where the bulk has been removed by alternative techniques.\r"

First, we studied 4 patients with bilateral medial thalamic infarctions using magnetic resonance imaging and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. All patients were followed for more than 1 year. Using a stereotactic method, we plotted the lesions in an atlas delineating the probable structure involved. Secondly, in 2 monkeys, using autoradiography, we traced the pathway from the amygdala to the dorsomedial nucleus, paying particular attention to the intrathalamic course of the amygdalothalamic projections. Our findings were (1) patients develop amnesia when infarctions are located anteriorly; (2) in patients with amnesia, the lesions can be small and strategically located, probably interfering with both hippocampal-related neural structures such as the mamillothalamic tract, and amygdala-related neural structures such as the ventroamygdalofugal pathway; and (3) a specific component of the latter is situated lateral but immediately adjacent to the mamillothalamic tract in the monkey, enabling both structures to be damaged bilaterally by small mirror image lesions. The amnesia is characterized by deficits in anterograde verbal and visual learning and in retrograde amnesia, but motor learning is preserved. We raise the possibility that bilateral diencephalic lesions may interfere particularly with temporal aspects of memory.\r"

The first task was repetitive tracing with the hand of an irregular geometric pattern with normal visual guidance, and the second task was repetitive tracing of a different geometric pattern with mirror-reversed vision. Patients with pathology limited to the cerebellum showed impairments in the skilled performance of the movement performed with normal vision that may have been related to a failure to alter movement strategy. Patients with added pathology in the brainstem exhibited impairments in adapting to mirror-reversed vision. Subsidiary experiments indicated that improvements of movements guided by mirror-reversed vision were mediated by vision. These results indicate that the cerebellum and its associated input pathways are involved in motor skill learning.\r"

In the present series cerebellar infarcts involved only the AICA territory in 13 cases. They were bilateral in 3 cases. In these pontocerebellar infarcts the middle cerebellar peduncle was the core of the affected territory. It was seldom selectively affected. In a few cases, the infarction extended to the flocculus. Next most frequently involved was a thin band of tissue in the adjacent cerebellar white matter, comprising laterally the neighbouring cerebellar lobules. The largest infarcts extended to the anterior and inferior aspects of the cerebellum. In these cases, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was hypoplastic. In most infarcts, the inferolateral pontine territory was involved, the infarction sometimes extending up to the middle third of the lateral pons and down to the superior part of the lateral medulla. No brainstem compression or tonsillar herniation were observed with infarcts affecting the AICA territory alone. Clinically, involvement of several cranial nerves (facial palsy, multimodal trigeminal sensory impairment, deafness, sometimes with tinnitus, a vestibular syndrome, or lateral gaze palsy) was constant. Cerebellar signs and motor weakness occurred frequently. Contralateral pain and temperature sensory loss was present at times. Horner's syndrome or skew deviation was rare. Study of the arteries showed that arterial occlusion was mainly due to thrombosis superimposed on atheromatous stenosis. In 7 cases, the infarction also involved the PICA territory or the PICA and the superior cerebellar artery territories. These extensive infarcts were often associated with tonsillar herniation and massive paramedian brainstem infarction. The cases in which the territories of the three cerebellar arteries were affected presented in deep coma, together with tetraplegia in some patients. Those in which PICA and AICA territories were involved together presented with similar clinical features as in the cases in which only the AICA territory was involved.\r"

In addition, nerve activity in both baroreceptor nerves was significantly reduced.

The severity of hemiplegic posture and motor disturbance in the proximal and distal muscles was related to the total amount of residual descending fibres in the CP. In all patients whose CPs were less than 60% of the normal size, recovery from disturbance in reaching and grasping movements and impairment of relative independent finger movements was incomplete. Recovery of these movements occurred when more than 60% of the CP was spared and the degree of recovery from motor weakness was positively correlated with the quantity of intact fibres spared (residual CP ratio). The ability to perform fine and discrete movements with the fingers, known to be an essential function of the pyramidal system, was consistently impaired in patients with severe shrinkage involving the medial division of the CP. There was no particular correlation between the CP shrinkage and neurological signs such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and pathological reflexes.\r"

In contrast, when bisecting lines under tactile-proprioceptive guidance, subjects err towards near peripersonal space, suggesting that normally attention is preferentially distributed away from the body during visual exploration but distributed towards the body during tactile exploration. A patient with ischaemic lesions, however, involving both inferior temporal lobes neglected far peripersonal and upper vertical space. He also demonstrated a motor bias away from the neglected space. These findings suggest that in man attention is spatially directed in three orthogonal axes (horizontal, vertical and radial), that attention may normally be unequally distributed in each of these axes, and that neglect may occur in not only the horizontal axis but also in the radial and vertical axes.\r"

The uniform clinical findings in 39 cases, aged 4-46 yrs, indicated abrupt symmetric isolated and permanent but not progressive damage to the upper motor neurons. Due to the failure of other food crops, the diet at onset consisted almost exclusively of bitter cassava roots, a drought-tolerant starchy root crop widely cultivated in Africa. The drought increased the natural occurrence of cyanogenic glucosides in the cassava roots, and the processing procedure normally applied in order to remove cyanide before consumption was shortened because of food shortage. The resulting high dietary cyanide exposure was confirmed by very high serum levels of thiocyanate, the detoxification product of cyanide. Tests for HTLV-1 antibodies were negative and no other findings supported an infectious aetiology. The clinical findings and the associations with cassava toxicity are almost identical to those reported from outbreaks of spastic paraparesis in Mozambique and in Zaire, where this disease was first reported under the name 'konzo'. We thus conclude that konzo constitutes a distinct upper motor neuron disease entity, probably caused by a toxic effect from insufficiently processed cassava under adverse dietary circumstances.\r"

A symbolic spatial cue (arrow) was used to indicate validly or invalidly the location of a visual target located to the left or right of the cue. Manual reaction time and reaction time to initiate a saccade to the target were measured. Patients with damage to the left frontal lobe (n = 6), right frontal lobe (n = 7) and right parietal lobe (n = 7) were compared with normal control subjects (n = 20). A sex difference was found for the right cerebral hemisphere patients in the manual reaction time data. Right parietal males and right frontal females showed an overall elevation in manual reaction time, reflecting an inability to maintain a normal level of visual arousal and/or motor activation. Conversely, right frontal males and right parietal females were not influenced significantly by cue validity, suggesting that they were unable to direct visual attention in a covert manner. All subjects showed a normal effect of cue validity on saccade reaction time. Thus the cortical areas studied do not appear to be necessary for directing visual attention with a saccade. Cue validity, however, affected saccade amplitude, especially in the left visual field of patients with right hemisphere damage. The cue validity effect depended both on the sex of the subject and the anterior/posterior location of damage in the right hemisphere. Damage to the right frontal lobe resulted in an 'under' reaction to the spatial cues, especially in the male patients. Saccades were smaller than normal following the valid cues, but larger than normal following the invalid cues. The effect was opposite following damage to the right parietal lobe. In this case, saccade amplitude reflected an 'over' reaction to the spatial cues, especially in the female patients. Saccades were larger than normal following valid cues and smaller than normal following invalid cues.\r"

  ".W": "Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction ratio (OER), oxygen utilization (CMRO2) and blood volume (CBV) were measured in a group of 34 healthy volunteers (age range 22-82 yrs) using the 15O steady-state inhalation method and positron emission tomography. Between subjects CBF correlated positively with CMRO2, although the interindividual variability of the measured values was large. OER was not dependent on CMRO2, but highly negatively correlated with CBF. CBV correlated positively with CBF. When considering the values of all the regions of interest within a single subject, a strict coupling between CMRO2 and CBF, and between CBF and CBV was found, while OER was constant and independent of CBF and CMRO2. In 'pure' grey and white matter regions CMRO2, CBF and CBV decreased with age approximately 0.50% per year. In other regions the decline was less evident, most likely due to partial volume effects. OER did not change or showed a slight increase with age (maximum in the grey matter region 0.35%/yr). The results suggest diminished neuronal firing or decreased dendritic synaptic density with age.\r"

  ".W": "Electrophysiological studies were performed on 17 patients with pontine haemorrhage. Most had had massive hypertensive bleeding, leading to death in 12 of them within 3 months. Of the 5 surviving patients, 2 had a poor outcome and 3 a moderately good outcome. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded in all patients, mostly with serial recordings. BAEPs were pathological in all patients. The most important finding was a reduction in amplitude or loss of waves. With a loss of waves after wave II bilaterally all patients died; the 2 patients with a normal amplitude of waves I-V at least on one side, survived in good condition. Further prognostic conclusions were not possible. The correlation with the clinical state was limited and was best for small unilateral tegmental haemorrhages. Eleven of the 17 patients suffered bilateral loss of the N20 component of the median nerve SEP. All these patients died. In patients with unilateral loss of the SEP the outcome could be favourable even if the bleeding extended across the midline. 'Subcortical' SEPs were not significantly altered. EEG findings in 15 and visual evoked potentials in 4 patients showed preserved forebrain electrical activity even in patients in poor condition.\r"

  ".W": "Toe-up or toe-down tilts of a platform on which a subject stands induce early EMG responses in the leg muscles initially stretched by the perturbation and late responses in the antagonist muscles. Early responses are thought to be connected with the stretch of the leg muscle in which they appear. Disagreement exists as to the origin of the late responses occurring in the antagonist muscle. The aims of this study were to assess (1) whether the late responses are induced by afferent volleys from the spindles of the muscle stretched by the initial perturbation, or (2) whether they are connected with the induced overall postural imbalance, and (3) whether the postural set may influence the occurrence of the late responses. Subjects standing on a platform underwent randomized perturbations stretching the soleus (Sol) muscle (upward tilts and backward translations) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles (downward tilts and forward translations). The platform movement was regulated in order to yield changes in ankle angle of similar extent and velocity during both tilt and translation. Surface EMGs of Sol and TA were recorded bilaterally. An optoelectronic device detected the movements of markers fixed on the body. From these data, movements of the head, and changes in hip, knee and ankle angles, along with variations in the length of Sol, gastrocnemii (Gas) and TA were computed. Both tilts and translations, equally stretching Sol or TA, induced similar early responses in the stretched muscle. Consistent late responses in the antagonist muscle (antagonist reactions, ARs) were induced only by tilts. In spite of similar changes in ankle angles, the most striking differences in body movements between tilts and translations stretching the same leg muscle concerned changes in knee angles and Gas length. Slight differences were also seen in vertical head movements. Standing and holding onto a frame strongly decreased the amplitude and the frequency of occurrence of both early responses and ARs only in the TA muscle, while all Sol responses were not affected. This modulation of TA responses occurred in spite of changes in ankle angle and head movements similar to those occurring under the free-standing condition. It was concluded that early EMG responses are connected with the stretch of the muscle induced by the platform movement. The ARs, on the other hand, appear to be related to the type of overall postural imbalance. The absence of ARs during translations suggests a role in these responses of the afferences from the joint and muscles of the lower limb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The left cerebral hemisphere in man contains anatomical structures specialized not only for language but also for higher-order motor programming. One method of studying the nature of these motor programs is by observing the type of errors made by patients who have left hemisphere damage. A major problem, however, in investigating the disorders that result from failure of this specialized left hemisphere system (the apraxias) has been the difficulty in obtaining objective measurement of movement in three-dimensional space. To this end, we provide the first three-dimensional analysis of the nature of movement errors in apraxia. Two apraxic subjects with lesions to the left hemisphere and 5 matched control subjects were studied. The apraxic subjects showed impairments in the control of movement timing and spatial relations, as well as decoupling in the normally tight relation between certain spatial and temporal aspects of their movement trajectories. Further, the use of the distal musculature by apraxic subjects was more impaired than their use of the proximal musculature, suggesting more distal representation in any space-time maps of learned movement. These data provide further insight into the nature of the representations of learned skilled movements in the left cerebral hemisphere.\r"
