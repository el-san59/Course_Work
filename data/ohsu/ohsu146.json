In study, 1, 10 patients with left ventricular failure received Sunitang in single oral doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg in a double-blind manner. Sunitang showed dose-related positive inotropic, chronotropic, and vasodilator effects. The effects reached their maximum within 30 to 60 minutes and lasted for 6 hours. In study 2, 77 patients with left ventricular failure who had not been treated satisfactorily by the conventional methods entered a controlled (parallel design), double-blind study for 1 month. When they entered the study they were in steady states. They continued their original medications throughout the month. Sunitang showed additional positive inotropic, chronotropic, and vasodilator effects. In this study no apparent adverse effects of Sunitang were noted. We conclude from these results that Sunitang may be useful in heart failure and bradycardia.\r"

Analgesic measurements were made by two trained nurse observers using standard verbal rating and visual analogue scales. Aspirin was statistically superior to placebo on all analgesic measures, demonstrating assay sensitivity. Fluradoline, 300 mg, was distinguished from placebo and fluradoline, 150 mg, but not from aspirin, 650 mg. Overall, fluradoline, 300 mg, was equivalent to aspirin, 650 mg. Fluradoline, 300 mg, produced a significant elevation in mood score. Neither aspirin, 650 mg, nor fluradoline caused untoward side effects, but fluradoline, 300 mg, increased blood pressure.\r"

It can affect persons of any age but is most commonly seen in patients 50 to 70 years old. Clinical findings are nonspecific in a large number of patients and, therefore, one should maintain a high clinical index of suspicion and be aware of abnormal laboratory data, particularly liver function tests. On the basis of these factors, one of the imaging techniques discussed earlier--particularly the ultrasound and the CT scan--should be ordered for the patient immediately. Once the diagnosis of liver abscess is made, the primary source of infection should be determined. Prompt antibiotic treatment and percutaneous drainage or open surgery, depending on the circumstances, should be used. This approach should minimize the morbidity and mortality in this disease that was otherwise always fatal just a few decades ago.\r"

Objective confirmation is sought with the use of M-mode and 2D echocardiography. A nondiagnostic echocardiogram, especially with recurrent or progressive symptoms and signs of atrial myxoma, should prompt more invasive methods of confirmation. The hemodynamic and angiographic data previously discussed may provide the clues needed for diagnosis, especially with nonprolapsing myxomas. The use of other techniques, such as a gated blood pool scanning or computerized tomography, affects primarily the incidental discovery of a \"silent\" tumor. Urgent surgical removal of the myxoma is mandatory to avoid progressive obstructive and embolic complications. Postoperative examination should be directed specifically at evaluating the patient for intracardiac tumor recurrence or growth of a peripheral embolic fragment. The incidence of these complications is small, but they are frequently overlooked. A second echocardiogram should be obtained as an initial baseline study. The asymptomatic patient should have subsequent routine clinical examinations to detect the growth of tumor embolic fragments and an echocardiographic examination every year or two to detect intracardiac tumor recurrence. Immediate evaluation is necessary should the patient develop recurrent symptoms.\r"

This investigation tested whether, after acute lung injury (ALI), APRV promotes alveolar ventilation and arterial oxygenation without increasing airway pressure (Paw) above the CPAP level and without depressing cardiac function. Ten anesthetized dogs randomly received either intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) or APRV. APRV was delivered with a continuous-flow CPAP system. Expiration occurred when a switch in the expiratory limb opened and Paw decreased to near-ambient, which decreased lung volume. After baseline data collection, ALI was induced by infusing oleic acid iv. Two hours later, IPPV and APRV were administered randomly, and data were collected. With normal lungs, APRV and IPPV achieved similar gas exchange and hemodynamic function. During ALI, arterial oxygenation was improved, and peak Paw which did not exceed the CPAP level, was lower during APRV. Similar minute ventilations were delivered by both modes but resulted in lower PaCO2 with APRV. Thus, APRV decreased physiologic deadspace ventilation. Hemodynamic status was similar during both modes. Therefore, APRV is an improved method of oxygenation and ventilatory support for patients with ALI that will allow unrestricted spontaneous ventilation and may decrease the incidence of barotrauma.\r"

In this controlled study, 32 septic ICU patients (mean initial fibronectin level = 60% of normal) received cryoprecipitate or control infusions. Although the fibronectin level was significantly elevated to the normal range in the cryoprecipitate group, no effects were seen in hemodynamics, oxygen metabolism, or lung and kidney functions. Our results indicate that this form of fibronectin therapy does not influence the impaired organ function in septic shock.\r"

The Trach Care catheter can be connected to the endotracheal tube of a patient on mechanical ventilation and be left in place as long as 24 h. Thus, suctioning does not require disconnection from the mechanical ventilator. We evaluated the benefits of this new system in 20 patients receiving mechanical ventilation; ten patients required PEEP of 10 cm H2O and under, while the other ten patients needed PEEP over 10 cm H2O to maintain acceptable oxygenation. PaCO2, arterial oxygen saturation, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference were measured before and after suctioning, using a conventional catheter and the Trach Care closed-suction method. Oxygenation only deteriorated when the open technique was used in patients receiving over 10 cm H2O of PEEP. The changes were statistically, but not clinically, significant. The Trach Care system is approximately 25 times as expensive as conventional suctions catheter, so its use cannot be justified economically. A potential advantage of the technique is preventing the dissemination of contaminated secretions, which are dispersed when the patient is disconnected from the ventilator and inspiratory gas flow persists. While no universal advantage of the closed-suction system was found, potential benefits may be considered on a case-by-case basis.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that angiotensin II could be a mediator of acute lung injury, we studied the effects of perindopril diacid, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, on hemodynamics, blood gases, lung mechanics, and extravascular lung water (EVLW). Twenty-four dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed and ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4 in which pulmonary edema was induced by 0.1 ml/kg iv oleic acid. Perindopril diacid (1 mg/kg) was administered iv either before (eight dogs) or 100 min after (eight dogs) oleic acid injection. In the control group (eight dogs) not treated with perindopril diacid, 150 min after oleic acid injection, PaO2 changed from 193 +/- 7 (mean +/- SEM) to 55 +/- 4 torr, venous admixture from 3 +/- 1% to 52 +/- 5%, cardiac index from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 3.1 +/- 0.3 L/min X m2, mean pulmonary artery pressure from 13 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 1 mm Hg, dynamic compliance from 90 +/- 8 to 46 +/- 7 ml/cm H2O, and EVLW from 165 +/- 25 to 750 +/- 92 ml/m2. Administration of perindopril diacid reduced systemic BP by 20% but did not affect other hemodynamic variables, blood gases, or dynamic compliance. Maximum increases in EVLW were from 169 +/- 16 to 615 +/- 54 ml/m2 in the pretreated group and from 188 +/- 23 to 675 +/- 56 ml/m2 in the treated group (no significant difference from the control group). However, pretreatment with perindopril diacid significantly (p less than .05) slowed the rise in EVLW, which was lower 60 and 90 min after oleic acid injection compared to untreated dogs. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin I concentration increased after oleic acid injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eleven (34%) of these infant baboons had persisting evidence for retrograde flow over the first 24 h by Doppler examination. Significantly higher fluid requirements and bicarbonate requirements were present in the animals with a persisting PDA. Mean aortic BP values were significantly lower in these same animals. No significant differences were found between groups when mean airway pressure, heart rate, urine output, or form of ventilation were compared. The only significant differences found between the conventional and high-frequency ventilated animals with PDA were higher peak airway pressures and lower PEEP levels in the conventionally ventilated infants. The premature baboons can be a useful primate model to study the PDA. There appears to be no significant difference regarding the clinical effects of HFV and CPPV on PDA.\r"

Twenty-five patients received postoperative mechanical ventilation for 16 to 24 h, 13 with an inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) of no more than 0.30 and 12 with an FIO2 of 0.50. After tracheal extubation, all patients spontaneously breathed room air (FIO2 0.21). Postextubation the calculated venous admixture of patients who had received 50% oxygen (0.20 +/- 0.03 [SD]) was significantly (p less than .01) greater than that calculated for patients who received lower oxygen concentrations (0.13 +/- 0.04). Consequently, the PaO2 of patients who had received 50% oxygen (60 +/- 5 torr) was significantly (p less than .03) lower than the PaO2 of patients who had received no more than 30% oxygen (66 +/- 7 torr). Thus, administration of 50% oxygen, supposedly nontoxic, to mechanically ventilated patients may cause impairment of pulmonary gas exchange after tracheal extubation. Although high concentrations of supplemental oxygen are sometimes required, unnecessary elevation of FIO2 is not likely to significantly increase oxygen delivery and may contribute to postextubation pulmonary dysfunction.\r"

Then they received 2.5 mg albuterol (Salbutamol) by inhalation, and the two parameters were measured again after 30 minutes. It was found that the drug has a dose-related effect on expiratory flow rates. Indeed, 20 mg nifedipine produced a mild (less than 10 percent) but significant improvement in FVC (p less than 0.01) and FEV1 (p less than 0.05), while the response to 10 mg was mild, not significant and manifested rather by a decrease in both parameters. In three patients, the forced expiratory flow rates markedly worsened. No correlation could be established between the effect of nifedipine and the severity of the disease. In contrast, the improvement produced by albuterol was strongly related to the degree of airway obstruction (p less than 0.001). Nifedipine in both doses did not potentiate the bronchodilatation induced by albuterol.\r"

Each had greater methacholine responsiveness on repeat study. The degree of methacholine hyperresponsiveness, judged by the PD20, could not predict which of the initial responders would develop asthma. Twenty-four (60 percent) of our patients showed normal responses to methacholine on initial study; none developed asthma and 88 percent remained nonresponders on repeat study.

  ".W": "Changes in intrathoracic pressure can influence cardiac performance by altering ventricular loading conditions. Since ventricular loading, both from systemic venous return (preload) and from left ventricular wall stress (afterload), varies during the cardiac cycle, we reasoned that appropriately placed, phasic, cardiac cycle-specific (synchronous) increases in intrathoracic pressure might augment ventricular ejection in acute ventricular failure. Recent studies in animals suggest that synchronous increases in intrathoracic pressure during systole increase ejection. We compared the hemodynamic effect of synchronous increases in intrathoracic pressure with similar increases delivered at random in the cardiac cycle in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy (n = 9). Intrathoracic pressure was estimated by measuring esophageal pressure. High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) synchronized with the electrocardiogram (synchronous HFJV) was compared with HFJV at a fixed frequency within 15 percent of the heart rate (asynchronous HFJV) and with intermittent positive-pressure breathing (IPPB) (tidal volume = 10 ml/kg; f = 15). All forms of ventilation resulted in the same mean airway pressure and esophageal pressure. Mean pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure and arterial pressure were constant in all conditions. Cardiac output was greater with synchronous HFJV than with either IPPB or asynchronous HFJV (4.5 +/- 0.7 L/min compared with 3.5 +/- 0.7 and 3.4 +/- 0.6 L/min [mean +/- SE], respectively; p less than 0.05). Mixed venous oxygen saturation covaried with cardiac output (p less than 0.05), such that calculated oxygen consumption remained constant for all conditions. We conclude that synchronous HFJV augments cardiac output more efficiently than do similar increases in intrathoracic pressure delivered randomly in the cardiac cycle.\r"

Blood flow in 17 colostomies has been measured at one week, median flux 28 units (range, 13 to 43) and in 12 colostomies more than eight weeks after formation, median flux 46 units (range, 35-56; P less than 0.002). Nine of the \"mature\" colostomies have been closed without a fecal fistula or other signs of anastomotic failure. Serial readings of colostomy blood flow were made at weekly intervals in another ten stomas over a period of two months. Blood flow increased over this time from a median of 19 units (range, 17 to 22) at one week to a median of 44 units (range, 39 to 48; P less than 0.002) at eight weeks. Laser Doppler flowmetry is a simple, noninvasive method of measuring colostomy blood flow and the findings support a clinical policy for delayed colostomy closure.\r"

We retrospectively identified 13 patients with a urinary sodium excretion lower than 15 mmol/day and 13 patients with a sodium excretion higher than 15 mmol/day. Using univariate analysis, all the patients with poor sodium excretion had abnormally high levels of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and arginine vasopressin. In addition, they had a diastolic blood pressure lower than patients with high urinary sodium excretion, although otherwise were comparable as regards clinical and biochemical data. The consistency of the above associations was then tested by multiple-regression analysis in an attempt to control for potentially confounding factors and to identify only true, independent associations. After a discriminant stepwise procedure, we found that low diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01) and high plasma aldosterone levels (P less than 0.05) were the only two conditions independently associated with abnormally low urinary sodium excretion. These findings are consistent with the view that sodium retention in decompensated cirrhosis results from a concomitant severe contraction in the effective blood volume and an increased production and/or retention of aldosterone. The concordance between our results and several pathophysiological findings supports the validity of this statistical approach to confirm physiological and/or clinical predictions.\r"

Animal studies have shown that a variety of agents afford such a protective effect. With some of these agents, a similar protective effect has been shown in man. This protective effect must be distinguished from an action that enhances healing of an already established mucosal lesion as an ulcer. It is yet to be established that the cytoprotective effect of an agent enhances ulcer healing. Agents other than prostaglandins that have been shown to possess such a cytoprotective effect in animals are reviewed. Some, such as sucralfate, act via stimulation of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis, while others, such as DeNol, neomycin, and meciadanol, do not. Investigation of the mechanism through which these agents enhance gastric mucosal defense is a fertile field for investigation.\r"

The interfering drugs include ascorbic acid, beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., cephalosporins and penicillins), levodopa, and salicylates. Several other drugs may also interfere with certain urine glucose tests, but the interactions are poorly documented. These drugs include chloral hydrate, hyaluronidase, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, p-aminosalicylic acid, phenazopyridine, probenecid, and X-ray contrast media. Drugs or their metabolites that are strong reducing substances produce false-positive results by the copper-reduction method and false-negative results by the glucose oxidase method. The beta-lactam antibiotics interfere with copper-reduction tests by producing copper compounds of various colors that confuse interpretation of test results. Tables are provided that summarize the drug interferences discussed.\r"

These three curves illustrate the median level of control and provide an index of variability in control at each hour of a \"typical day.\" We observed distinctive AGPs related to the variability in metabolic control and the type of diabetes. Comparisons between diagnostic groups showed consistent differences between groups, independent of level of glycemic control. Review of serial AGPs obtained for sequential 2-wk periods for 23 non-pregnant individuals with type I diabetes and 10 women with gestational diabetes revealed changes in AGP corresponding to alterations in regimen. The AGP provides a new approach to the evaluation of glycemic control, with applications to patient and physician education, clinical investigation, and individual patient care.\r"

The mechanism of action of metformin and other biguanides is not completely understood, but recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that metformin may act in part by both increasing the binding of insulin to its receptor and potentiating insulin action. Metformin, because of its chemical structure, does not interact with the liver and has a short half-life. Consequently, lactic acidosis, which is a rare complication of metformin, has not been associated with the proper use of this drug. In addition to its antidiabetic actions, metformin causes weight loss in obese diabetic patients and may be useful in managing associated lipid disorders.\r"

  ".W": "A Danish population of 5699 individuals (60-74 yr old) was screened by fasting blood glucose (FBG) and interviewed about known diabetes. The distribution of FBG in individuals not known to have diabetes showed no sex difference or significant variation with age. Fasting hyperglycemia (FH), defined as FBG greater than or equal to mM in subjects without a history of diabetes, was found in 1.7% of men and women. Known diabetes (KD) had a prevalence of 3.9 and 5.0% in men and women, respectively. The prevalence rates of FH and KD increased significantly with age. In the two subgroups, plasma C-peptide was measured after overnight fasting and subsequently 6 min after an intravenous injection of glucagon. Based on the distribution of the C-peptide concentrations in non-insulin-treated KD subjects, lower limits for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) of 0.30 pmol/ml for fasting C-peptide and 0.60 pmol/ml for stimulated C-peptide were arbitrarily chosen. According to these cutoff points, only 38.5% of KD subjects treated with insulin had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, corresponding to 9.3% of all KD subjects. After exclusion of these patients, the prevalence of recognized NIDDM was 3.5% in men and 4.5% in women. All FH subjects except one had C-peptide values in the NIDDM interval. A close agreement between fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-peptide was seen. In epidemiological studies with an expected high prevalence of NIDDM, we propose to use fasting C-peptide for classification of patients with insulin-treated diabetes.\r"

For the 12 C-peptide-positive children (basal C-peptide greater than or equal to 0.03 pmol/ml) there were no differences in the basal or stimulated values between tests 1 and 2. The effect of exogenous insulin on C-peptide secretion was assessed in 20 other children (group 2) by their responses to two Sustacal tests, one test without and one with soluble insulin (0.25 U/kg) injected subcutaneously before testing. Eleven children were C-peptide positive and had no differences in C-peptide response between tests 1 and 2. The results from test 1 in groups 1 and 2 were combined with those from 44 others undergoing a single Sustacal test (group 3, N = 84). There was a close correlation between basal and peak C-peptide concentrations in the 44 C-peptide-positive children (r = .88, P less than .001). Peak C-peptide concentrations correlated inversely with HbA1 (r = -.29, P less than .01), insulin dose in units per kilogram (r = -.40, P less than .001), and duration of diabetes (r = .33, P less than .001) and positively with age at onset of diabetes (r = .34, P less than .001). The C-peptide-positive children had reduced glucose response to Sustacal, lower HbA1 concentration, lower insulin requirement, later age of onset, and shorter duration of diabetes than children who were C-peptide negative.\r"

Group 1 was treated with oral prednisone (60 mg X m-2 X day-1 for 14 days, 30 and 15 mg X m-2 X day-1 for 7 days). Group 2 matched the control group. All patients were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for the first 15 days of treatment, and then with two daily injections of a mixture of intermediate- and fast-acting insulin. All subjects were followed for 1 yr. Group 1 required more insulin than group 2 after 30 days (1.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.6 $ 0.2 U X kg-1 X day-1, P less than .001) and after 60 days (0.8 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.06 U X kg-1 X day-1, P less than .001). After 3 mo, both groups reached the lowest mean stable HbA1 level (8.4 +/- 0.4 and 8.3 +/- 0.4% group 1 and 2 respectively). Between the 2nd and 9th mo of follow-up, mean postbreakfast C-peptide concentration increased in both groups. The highest levels of fasting C-peptide were reached by group 1 after 90 days (0.77 +/- 0.32 nM) and group 2 after 60 days (0.34 +/- 0.09 nM). The largest partial remission (C-peptide 0.3 nM, insulin requirement less than 0.5 U X kg-1 X day-1 and no glycosuria) was observed in group 1 after 180 days (5 of 16 patients) and in group 2 after 60 days (5 of 15 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen newly diagnosed diabetic subjects, 5 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 8 with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, mean age 37.1 yr (range 25-64 yr), underwent glucose-clamp studies at diagnosis of diabetes at plasma glucose 200 mg/dl. Each subject was then treated twice daily with insulin for 6 mo with improvement in glycemic control, and the glucose-clamp studies repeated. Changes in glucose uptake at an insulin infusion rate of 1.0 mU X kg-1 X min-1 varied greatly from diagnosis to 6 mo. There were significant negative correlations between change in glucose uptake and diabetes type (r = -.78, P less than .002), C-peptide secretion (r = -.66, P less than .05), and age (r = -.62, P less than .05). At an insulin infusion rate of 10 mU X kg-1 X min-1 there was improvement in glucose uptake from diagnosis to 6 mo that did not reach statistical significance. During the steady-state periods of the glucose-clamp studies at diagnosis, growth hormone (GH) rose above basal, which reached statistical significance at the higher insulin infusion rate. This increase in GH was not apparent at the time of the glucose-clamp studies after insulin therapy. Our results indicate that in the clinical situation, only patients with IDDM can expect an improvement in their sensitivity to physiologic insulin levels with long-term insulin therapy. In all subjects, improvement in glycemic control leads to abolition of GH secretion in the presence of hyperglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "Euglycemic insulin glucose-clamp and insulin-binding studies on erythrocytes and monocytes were performed in seven type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects before and after 4 wk of metformin treatment (850 mg 3 times/day) and in five obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance. Glucose turnover was also measured at basal insulin concentrations and during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps. During euglycemic insulin-glucose clamps, diabetic subjects showed glucose disposal rates of 3.44 +/- 0.42 and 7.34 +/- 0.34 mg X kg-1 X min-1 (means +/- SD) before metformin at insulin infusion rates of 0.80 and 15.37 mU X kg-1 X min-1, respectively. With the same insulin infusion rates, glucose disposal was 4.94 +/- 0.55 (P less than .01) and 8.99 +/- 0.66 (P less than .01), respectively, after metformin treatment. Glucose disposal rates in normal obese subjects were 5.76 +/- 0.63 (P less than .01) and 10.92 +/- 1.11 (P less than .01) at 0.80 and 15.37 mU X kg-1 X min-1, respectively. Insulin maximum binding to erythrocytes in diabetics was 9.6 +/- 4.2 and 5.8 +/- 2.6 X 10(9) cells (means +/- SD) before and after metformin treatment, respectively (NS). Insulin maximum binding to monocytes in diabetics was 6.2 +/- 2.3 X 10(7) cells before and 5.0 +/- 1.6% after metformin. Hepatic glucose production was higher in the diabetic patients at basal insulin levels, but not at higher insulin concentrations, and was not significantly changed by drug treatment. Basal glucose and insulin concentrations decreased with metformin. Thus, metformin treatment improved glucose disposal rate without significant effect on insulin-binding capacity on circulating cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examines some information on the extent and breadth of public and private health insurance for individuals with diabetes, as well as some estimates of their use of health-care services and their mean expenses for this care. About 12% of all diabetic patients less than 65 yr old (approximately 311,000 individuals) were uninsured throughout 1977, a rate not much different from that for the rest of the United States population. Those with diabetes who are uninsured tend to be younger, Black or Hispanic, in excellent or good health, and live outside of metropolitan areas and in the South or West. As expected, diabetic patients use more medical care than others of their age and sex, and their medical expenses are also much higher, particularly in younger age groups. In 1977, average total medical-care expenses for people with diabetes were $1514 compared with $548 for the rest of the population. They and their families paid approximately 20% out of pocket (approximately $355). Their health insurance premiums were not much different from those without diabetes, averaging approximately $1000 in 1977 for those under age 65. The private insurance coverage for diabetic patients was similar to that for others, although slightly fewer had major medical coverage than the general population.\r"

The primary side effect is a dose-related suppression of bone marrow function. Other reported toxic effects include mucositis, nausea, vomiting, cardiotoxicity, liver dysfunction, and alopecia. Despite these negative effects, amsacrine appears to have a role in the combination therapy of acute leukemias.\r"

  ".U": "87190047\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of inhibitors of insulin secretion on the concentration of plasma insulin and on the subcellular distribution of hepatic insulin receptors have been examined in rats. Liver plasma membranes, Golgi fractions, and a total particulate fraction were prepared various times after the injection of diazoxide (10 mg), xylazine (0.5 mg), and somatostatin (20 micrograms as a bolus followed by a 20 micrograms/15-min infusion), solubilized by Triton X-100, and examined for specific insulin binding. Injection of each of these drugs caused a 4- to 8-fold decrease in plasma insulin concentration, and concomitantly, a 25-35% decrease in insulin binding to Golgi fractions; a 10% increase in insulin binding to plasma membranes also occurred in diazoxide-treated rats. Insulin binding to the total particulate fraction was unaffected. These changes achieved maximum by 10-30 min and underwent complete reversal in 1 h. The decrease in insulin binding to Golgi fractions resulted exclusively from a change in receptor number and was accompanied by a 4- to 6-fold decrease in the content of extractable insulin in these fractions; the latter observation suggests that receptor internalization, rather than receptor synthesis, is diminished. The effects of diazoxide on plasma insulin concentration, insulin binding to Golgi fractions, and insulin content of Golgi fractions were fully prevented by tolbutamide, a stimulant of insulin secretion. These results show that acute hypoinsulinemias in rats are accompanied by changes in the subcellular distribution of hepatic insulin receptors that are opposite to those previously observed in acute hyperinsulinemias. Furthermore, both in acute hyperinsulinemic and hypoinsulinemic models, a significant correlation is observed between plasma insulin concentration on the one hand, and insulin binding to Golgi fractions as well as insulin content of Golgi fractions on the other. It is concluded that the extent to which hepatic insulin receptors are internalized is a function of their occupancy by endogenous hormone, and that, at least under acute conditions, receptor internalization is one major mechanism involved in receptor regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like immunoreactivity has been found in nerves that innervate the rat ovary. In this study, we used immunohistochemical and biochemical methods to identify NPY in the prepubertal rat ovary. The normal distribution of NPY-containing nerve fibers and the route by which these nerves enter the ovary were analyzed with indirect immunofluorescence techniques. In ovaries with intact nerves, a profuse network of NPY-labeled fibers was observed surrounding blood vessels. Immunoreactive fibers were also seen in the interstitial tissue and coursing between follicles. Occasionally some fibers appeared to enter the follicles. Surgical transection of the superior ovarian nerve had no effect on NPY immunoreactivity; however, transection of the plexus nerve completely eliminated NPY-labeled nerve fibers in all ovarian compartments. The nature of this immunoreactivity was examined in extracts of pooled ovaries that were subjected to reverse phase HPLC and then analyzed by RIA. The major peak of NPY immunoreactivity in each extract eluted at the same time or slightly before synthetic porcine NPY. Two additional peaks of NPY-like immunoreactivity that eluted much earlier than porcine NPY were found in each extract. We conclude that the plexus nerve carries NPY afferents to the ovary and that the ovary contains NPY-like peptides, one of which has a retention time on reverse phase HPLC nearly identical to that of porcine NPY, whereas two others elute with earlier retention times. While the identity and composition of these substances remain to be determined, the presence of peptides that display NPY-like immunoreactivity in the ovary as well as the profuse network of NPY-containing fibers strongly imply a physiological involvement of NPY in the regulation of ovarian function.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, the rat ovary was shown to contain significant levels of a GnRH-like protein, but no detectable GnRH. In the present studies, extracts of bovine ovaries and ovine corpora lutea were examined for their content of both GnRH-like protein and GnRH. The GnRH-like proteins were detected with a rat ovarian membrane radioreceptor assay, and GnRH was detected with a specific GnRH RIA. The biological activity of the GnRH-like protein was evaluated with a rat luteal cell assay. GnRH-like activity, but not GnRH, was clearly present in extracts of the entire bovine ovary, bovine corpus luteum, bovine granulosa cells, and ovine corpus luteum. The highest levels of GnRH-like activity were present in granulosa cells. Neither GnRH-like activity nor GnRH was detected in extracts of bovine follicular fluid or bovine jugular plasma. Fractionation of the bovine and ovine GnRH-like proteins by reverse phase HPLC resulted in retention times similar to that of the rat ovarian GnRH-like protein, but distinctly different from that of authentic GnRH. The bovine and ovine GnRH-like fractions, like those in the rat, were sensitive to protease and heat. The bovine GnRH-like protein, obtained by preparative reverse phase HPLC, evoked a dose-dependent inhibition of LH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in rat luteal cells similar to that caused by GnRH. Based on these results, we suggest that the bovine ovary, granulosa cells, and corpus luteum and the ovine corpus luteum contain an antigonadotropic GnRH-like protein similar to the GnRH-like protein of the rat ovary. The presence of a similar GnRH-like protein (but the absence of GnRH) in ovaries of domestic species and the rat raises the possibility that this substance may play a paracrine antigonadotropic role in the ovary of diverse species.\r"

  ".U": "87190054\r", 
  ".W": "Arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids generated by glucose stimulation of phospholipase A2 may be related to the biphasic pattern of insulin secretion. Therefore, we examined the effects of glucose, exogenous phospholipase A2, lysophospholipids, and pharmacological agents which perturb the reesterification or oxygenation of arachidonic acid in superfused monolayer cultures of neonatal rat islet cells. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (20 microM), an inhibitor of islet lipoxygenase, significantly decreased phasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, especially during phase 1, suggesting that stimulatory lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid contribute to the effects of glucose stimulation. Treatment with exogenous phospholipase A2 (10 mU/ml) or melittin (1.0 or 2.0 micrograms/ml) to generate arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids de novo caused a monophasic release of insulin, followed by a gradual decline in insulin secretion despite the continued presence of these agonists. Conversely, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (15, 30, and 50 microM), which blocks the reacylation of lysophospholipids with arachidonic acid, evoked a concentration-dependent biphasic stimulation of insulin secretion which was reversible. Lipoxygenase inhibition had no effect upon phase 1 secretion by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, although it did partially reduce phase 2 secretion. However, lysophosphatidylcholine (50, 75, and 100 micrograms/ml) also caused a concentration-dependent biphasic stimulation of insulin secretion which resembled that seen with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, suggesting that lysophospholipids were mediating the effects of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. We speculate that during glucose stimulation of the islet, the following three phospholipase A2-initiated changes may be important: generation of lysophospholipid to stimulate directly insulin secretion, generation of arachidonic acid and lipoxygenase-mediated arachidonate metabolites, which positively modulate insulin secretion, and generation of cyclooxygenase-mediated arachidonate metabolites, which negatively modulate insulin secretion.\r"

  ".U": "87190056\r", 
  ".W": "Mouse islets were used to test the hypothesis that the B cell membrane must be depolarized for acetylcholine to increase insulin release. The resting membrane potential of B cells (at 3 mM glucose) was slightly decreased (5 mV) by acetylcholine, but no electrical activity appeared. This depolarization was accompanied by a Ca-independent acceleration of 86Rb and 45Ca efflux but no insulin release. When the B cell membrane was depolarized by a stimulatory concentration of glucose (10 mM), acetylcholine potentiated electrical activity, accelerated 86Rb and 45Ca efflux, and increased insulin release. This latter effect, but not the acceleration of 45Ca efflux, was totally dependent on extracellular Ca. If glucose-induced depolarization of the B cell membrane was prevented by diazoxide, acetylcholine lost all effects but those produced at low glucose. In contrast, when the B cell membrane was depolarized by leucine or tolbutamide (at 3 mM glucose), acetylcholine triggered a further depolarization with appearance of electrical activity, accelerated 86Rb and 45Ca efflux, and stimulated insulin release. Acetylcholine produced similar effects (except for electrical activity) in the presence of high K or arginine which, unlike the above test agents, depolarize the B cell membrane by a mechanism other than a decrease in K+ permeability. Omission of extracellular Ca abolished the releasing effect of acetylcholine under all conditions but only partially decreased the stimulation of 45Ca efflux. The results show thus that acetylcholine stimulation of insulin release does not result from mobilization of cellular Ca but requires that the B cell membrane be sufficiently depolarized to reach the threshold potential where Ca channels are activated. This may explain why acetylcholine alone does not initiate release but becomes active in the presence of a variety of agents.\r"

  ".W": "Immunological and binding methods have been used to demonstrate that acute inflammation induced in the pregnant mouse by a single sc turpentine injection elicits plasma protein responses in the fetal as well as in the maternal compartment. The maternal response involves, along with the classical pattern of positive and negative acute phase reactants seen in the inflammatory nonpregnant animal, a highly specific approximately 2-fold increase of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations. In addition, the high pregnancy-associated corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) levels drop dramatically (2-3 times) in response to inflammation. The fetal response is characterized by small (10-25%) but statistically significant declines of AFP, CBG, and albumin concentrations, without any increase in levels of the positive classical acute phase reactants. The divergent responses of the estrophilic mouse AFP on the two sides of the placental barrier result in a 3- to 4-fold enrichment of the maternal serum vs. an approximately 20% impoverishment of the fetal serum in high affinity estrogen binding sites. The similar decrease in levels of CBG in mother and fetus leads to marked losses of high affinity corticosteroid sites for both. Neither the affinity constants for the estrogen-AFP interactions nor those for the corticosterone-CBG interactions are affected by inflammation. This is the first report of AFP as a positive marker of acute inflammation, of AFP as a pregnancy-specific inflammatory reactant in the mouse, and of a plasma protein response of the fetus in utero to an inflammatory stress undergone by the mother.\r"

  ".W": "Intracerebroventricular administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been shown to modify LH secretion, with the direction of the response dependent on the steroid background. To study further the role of gonadal steroids in the regulation of NPY secretion, the basal and KCl-evoked release of NPY from the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) of intact and castrated male rats was assessed twice with the use of an in vitro incubation system. In each experiment, the amounts of NPY released in response to a 15-min pulse of KCl (45 mM) were significantly smaller from the MBH of castrated rats than of intact rats (P less than 0.05). Next, to assess the possible effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the MBH were exposed in a similar manner to two 15-min pulses, 30 min apart, of 0.568 and 56.8 mumol PGE2. Unlike KCl, PGE2 failed to stimulate NPY release from the MBH of either intact or castrated rats. However, a similar 56.8 mumol concentration of PGE2 was effective in stimulating the release of LHRH. We next examined the effects of castration on NPY levels in several microdissected regions of the hypothalamus. Whereas NPY concentrations were unchanged in the medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus, NPY levels were significantly decreased in the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, and ventromedial nucleus 2 weeks after castration. These studies show that KCl can stimulate NPY release from the MBH in vitro, like that of LHRH, the KCl-induced NPY response is significantly smaller from the MBH of castrated than intact males, castration can significantly reduce the levels of NPY in the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, and ventromedial nucleus, thereby suggesting that testicular secretions may modulate NPY levels and release from the MBH, and because PGE2 stimulated the release of LHRH but not of NPY, separate regulatory neural events may underlie the secretion of these two neuropeptides.\r"

The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for the higher and lower affinity INS binding components were 0.01 X 10(-9) M and 2.5 X 10(-9) M, respectively. During the latter half of pregnancy INS binding increased gradually and peaked on the day of parturition (159.9 +/- 19.8, 196.3 +/- 24.6, 254.7 +/- 36.8, and 272.6 +/- 29.1 and femtomolars per mg protein, mean +/- SEM on days 15, 20, 21, and 22 of gestation, respectively). The pattern of increased INS binding paralleled the prepartum increase in myometrial cell nuclear estrogen receptors as well as myometrial glycogen levels. In contrast, low INS binding was associated with elevated cell nuclear progestin receptor levels, on day 15 and immediately postpartum. These results suggest that, during the latter half of pregnancy, myometrial INS binding capacity and glycogen concentration gradually increase. Since INS receptor levels begin to increase in parallel with increasing nuclear estrogen receptors, INS receptor synthesis may be under estrogen control.\r"

  ".U": "87190084\r", 
  ".W": "To establish an in vitro model to investigate the glucagon-related peptides, fetal rat intestinal cells were enzymatically dispersed and placed into culture for up to 7 days. After 1 day in culture, the presence of epithelial-like cells containing glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI) was demonstrated using immunocytochemical techniques. The cell peptides were extracted by passage through a cartridge of octadecylsilyl silica and characterized by gel filtration and RIA. Two GLI moieties were detected with apparent mol wts of 11,000-12,000 and 5,000-6,000. The immunoreactive profile obtained for the cells in culture was identical to that of both whole fetal rat intestine and adult rat ileum. The presence of glucagon could not be demonstrated in any of the extracts. The basal levels of GLI and apparent immunoreactive glucagon (IRGa) were 1,457 +/- 381 and 198 +/- 57 pg/dish, respectively, on day 1 of culture. The GLI content of the cells, but not the IRGa, declined with time in culture for up to 5-7 days (P less than 0.03). Addition of insulin to the culture medium (10 or 100 mU/ml) did not influence the decrease in GLI content of the cells, but did inhibit the production of IRGa (P less than 0.05). Addition of 500 mg/dl glucose to the cells in the presence of 20 microU/ml insulin increased the secretion of GLI by 42 +/- 7% over 2 h (P less than 0.05). The stimulation by glucose was not seen in the absence of insulin or with higher insulin concentrations (100 microU/ml), nor did insulin alone (100 microU/ml) have any effect on the release of GLI. Thus, fetal rat intestinal cells in culture produce the GLI peptides, and secrete them in response to glucose. This system may provide a means by which the synthesis and control of secretion of the glucagon-related peptides can be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin D binding protein (DBP), a Mr 56,000-58,000 alpha 2-glycoprotein, is the major serum protein involved in the transport of vitamin D sterols. Recently it has been suggested that DBP may also be involved in immunoglobulin G binding to cells. Because the trophoblast is involved in the transport of molecules such as vitamin D and immunoglobulin G to the fetus, we asked whether DBP could be detected on the surface of human placental trophoblast cells. Cytotrophoblasts purified from human term placentae were fixed and made permeant with Triton X-100 and examined by indirect immunofluorescence after incubation with a monoclonal antibody to DBP. Greater than 90% of these cells stained positively, whereas no staining was observed with nonimmune antiserum. The presence of DBP on/in the surface of cytotrophoblasts could also be demonstrated by fluorescent cytometry. When cell surface-associated proteins of cytotrophoblasts were radioiodinated, a Mr 57,000 radiolabeled protein could be immunoisolated from the cell lysate with a purified monospecific polyclonal antibody to DBP. Immunoisolation of this radiolabeled protein was prevented by the addition of excess unlabeled human DBP to the cell lysate before incubation with antibody. This Mr 57,000 radiolabeled protein could also be isolated by affinity chromatography selecting for proteins that bind to globular actin. When cytotrophoblasts were incubated with [35S]methionine for 3 or 18 h, active synthesis of DBP could not be demonstrated by immunoisolation techniques. These studies demonstrate the presence of DBP on the surface of well washed, human cytotrophoblasts. This DBP may be maternally derived, since active synthesis of DBP could not be demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin has been shown previously to inhibit basal and glucocorticoid- or T3-stimulated rat GH (rGH) synthesis, secretion, and mRNA levels in cultured rat pituitary tumor cells (GH3 cells) or pituitaries. The effects of insulin on rGH gene expression in GH3 cells were examined in greater detail in the current studies. Cells were deinduced for 5 days in medium devoid of steroids, T3, and insulin. Cells were then treated for 48 h with insulin (5 X 10(-9) M), dexamethasone (Dex; 10(-6) M), T3 (10(-8) M), insulin plus Dex, or insulin plus T3. When media and hormones were not replaced daily the results were similar to those obtained previously. Insulin decreased both basal and glucocorticoid-stimulated rGH mRNA levels to approximately 70% of control levels, as measured by cytoplasmic dot hybridization. By contrast, when media and hormones were replaced daily, rGH mRNA levels increased by 1.5 to 7-fold in response to insulin in the absence or presence of Dex or T3, measured by both cytoplasmic dot hybridization and RNA (Northern) blotting. Dex increased rGH mRNA levels under both sets of conditions, verifying the specific nature of the insulin influence. Maximum rGH gene expression was achieved after a 48-h exposure to insulin. The observed insulin effects were probably mediated through insulin rather than insulin-like growth factor I or II receptors, since the concentration of insulin employed was near the Kd of the hormone for its receptor measured in the same cells. These results suggest that insulin is capable of regulating rGH gene expression. The action of insulin can be either positive or negative and is influenced by the metabolic state of the cell.\r"

Expression of the IGF-I gene was examined in GH3 cells, a rat pituitary tumor cell line secreting GH and PRL. Increasing concentrations of RNA extracts of GH3 cells yielded a linear increase in hybridization intensity with a 32P-labeled mouse IGF-I cDNA probe. Northern analysis of GH3 cells poly(A) RNA revealed IGF-I mRNA transcripts 1.3, 5.3, and 7.7 kilobases in size. Poly(A) RNA extracts of BALBc/3T3 fibroblasts, a cell line dependent on exogenous somatomedins for DNA synthesis, and of JEG-3 cells, a choriocarcinoma cell line, did not hybridize with the IGF-I cDNA probe. GH3 cells showed positive immunoperoxidase staining using a rabbit anti[Thr59]IGF-I antibody which was largely blocked by prior incubation of the antibody with excess IGF-I. Negligible background peroxidase activity was present in cells incubated with a rabbit nonimmune serum and PBS. Furthermore, BALBc/3T3 fibroblasts showed only weak specific staining with the IGF-I antibody. Finally, GH3 cells secreted IGF-I into the culture medium in a time-dependent fashion, while neither 3T3 nor JEG-3 cells produced detectable medium levels of the peptide after 72 h of incubation. As IGF-I is known to inhibit GH production by the pituitary, the data shown suggest that locally produced IGF-I may regulate GH secretion in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.\r"

  ".U": "87190093\r", 
  ".W": "The two phases of the ovulatory menstrual cycle of the primate are characterized by divergent activities of the GnRH pulse generator. During the luteal phase, LH pulse frequency is significantly reduced below that observed during the follicular phase. In this report we investigate whether the decrease in pulse frequency during the luteal phase is of physiological relevance to normal menstrual cyclicity. We have tested the effect of a pulsatile GnRH infusion given iv at hourly intervals for a period of 8-10 days during the luteal phase on the subsequent three to five cycles in eight female rhesus monkeys. Three of the eight animals received two treatment courses. Amounts of GnRH infused were 1.5 micrograms/pulse (n = 2 trials); 3.0 micrograms/pulse (n = 7); and 4.0 micrograms/pulse (n = 2). LH response to GnRH pulses of 1.5 and 3.0 micrograms resembled spontaneous LH pulses observed during the luteal phase. During the GnRH infusion period, the monkeys were fitted with a primate vest and tethered. Eleven control experiments were performed in these monkeys under similar conditions. GnRH therapy during the luteal phase affected subsequent cycles significantly, while no differences were observed in the control experiments. Overall mean follicular phase length in the control cycle was 13.4 days; it was significantly increased (P less than 0.005) in all post-GnRH treatment cycles to reach 34.4 (+/- 10.9), 43.9 (+/- 12.7), 40.4 (+/- 13.0), and 23.1 (+/- 4.8) days (+/- SE) in the first to fourth post-GnRH cycles, respectively. Progesterone secretion was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the first two post-GnRH cycles than in the control cycles: progesterone, 46.4 (+/- 2.1) in all control cycles, decreased to 27.7 (+/- 3.7), 24.8 (+/- 4.3), 34.0 (+/- 5.4), and 32.0 (+/- 6.5) surface units (+/- SE) from the first to fourth post-GnRH cycles, respectively, while luteal phase length remained relatively unchanged. The data indicate that significant disturbances in the menstrual cycle of the rhesus monkey follow imposed changes in the normal frequency pattern of the GnRH hypophysiotropic signal during the luteal phase and suggest that the naturally occurring slowing of GnRH-LH pulse frequency during the luteal phase is a relevant phenomenon in the sequence of events which control menstrual cyclicity.\r"

  ".W": "Relaxin release from dispersed luteal cells was detected by a reverse hemolytic plaque assay to determine the influence of gestational age on basal relaxin secretion. Monodispersed luteal cells were derived by collagenase treatment of corpora lutea obtained from pigs in early (days 19-26), mid-(days 47-62), and late (days 80-99) gestation. The rate of plaque development under nonstimulated conditions progressively accelerated as gestation advanced, as did the rate of increase in plaque size. These results unequivocally demonstrate that basal relaxin release increases with advancing gestation. However, only about 50% of large luteal cells released relaxin at all stages of pregnancy examined up to day 100. These data indicated not only that basal relaxin release increases during pregnancy, but also that considerable heterogeneity exists with respect to relaxin output by individual cells. In contrast, both the basal rate of relaxin release and the percentage of cells committed to relaxin release declined significantly when luteal cells derived from preparturient sows (days 107-112 of gestation) were examined. Exposure of cultured luteal cells to prostaglandin F2 alpha (10(-8) and 10(-6) M) resulted in a rapid stimulation of relaxin secretion, but this agent did not recruit additional cells into the secretory pool. These data are consistent with the idea that autonomous changes and the action of secretagogues may combine at different times to achieve overall regulation of relaxin release by the corpus luteum. The significance of nonrelaxin-releasing luteal cells remains to be determined.\r"

  ".U": "87190101\r", 
  ".W": "We have characterized the interaction of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) with its plasma membrane receptor(s) on cultured rat chondrocytes. Our studies, paralleling those already reported for IGF-I, demonstrate that [125I]IGF-II binds to these receptors with a high degree of affinity and that this process is reversible, specific, and time, temperature, and concentration dependent. At 4 C, unlabeled IGF-II causes half-maximal displacement of the labeled ligand at a concentration of 22 ng/ml, whereas IGF-I is approximately 1/200th as potent, and insulin does not displace [125I]IGF-II even at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. Maximum binding to chondrocytes (44% of added radioactivity) occurred after 4-5 h of incubation at 15 C. Compared to [125I]IGF-I binding, this value is 7-fold higher and is consistent with an affinity constant (Ka = 3.8 X 10(8) M-1) approximately 1 order of magnitude greater. Photoaffinity labeling studies disclose that IGF-II binds primarily to the type II IGF receptor, which has an apparent mol wt of 220K when electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions and 270K under reducing conditions. Nanomolar concentrations of IGF-II stimulated the synthesis of DNA and RNA in a dose-related manner, and micromolar concentrations of insulin demonstrated an additive effect with respect to the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, but not [3H]uridine into RNA. Preincubation of rat chondrocytes with increasing concentrations of insulin caused a marked dose-related increase in [125I]IGF-II binding, a phenomenon previously reported in several other cell types. In addition to defining the binding characteristics of IGF-II, we used the lysosomotropic agents chloroquine and ammonium chloride to demonstrate that its ligand-receptor complex, like that of IGF-I, is internalized and degraded partially via the lysosomal pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The liver and kidney nuclear T3 content and the maximal nuclear T3-binding capacity (MBC) were measured 1 month after streptozotocin administration and compared with values in controls either fed ad libitum (C) or offered a restricted diet (FR). A group of insulin-treated diabetic (D+I) rats was also included. Plasma T4 and T3 concentrations decreased to low levels in diabetic (D) rats. Plasma T3 levels were decreased in FR rats, whereas circulating T4 was in the normal range for C animals. The MBC (nanograms of T3 per mg DNA) for liver and kidney nuclear T3 was determined by an in vivo saturation technique. The respective results for all groups were as follows (asterisks denote values differing from C with P values less than 0.05): C, 0.601 and 0.414; FR, 0.583 and 0.369; D, 0.310 and 0.220; D+I, 0.630 and 0.394. Nuclear T4 and T3 concentrations were determined by an isotopic equilibrium technique. Nuclear T3 (nanograms per mg DNA) for liver and kidney were, respectively, 0.298 and 0.176 for C, 0.208 and 0.135 for FR, 0.109 and 0.070 for D, and 0.270 and 0.168 for D+I rats. The decreased liver and kidney nuclear T3 content in D rats appears to be due to a marked reduction of their available intracellular T4 pool, from which T3 could be generated, but most likely represents a decreased T3 uptake into liver and kidney nuclei, as the nuclear to plasma ratios of labeled T3 were decreased in D rats. The low levels of T3 in nuclei of FR rats could be attributed to an inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, since the intracellular pool of T4 appears to be normal. The possibility that diabetes and food restriction might affect the thyroid activity was examined by measurement of the activities of alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and cytosol malic enzyme, two liver and kidney enzymes regulated by thyroid hormone. Furthermore, although the measurements made in FR rats excluded the possibility that the alterations in MBC found in D animals were nutrition dependent, the reduced nuclear T3 content concomitant with food restriction may account for some of the quantitative changes in the alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and cytosol malic enzyme activity found in D rat tissues. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that the observed changes in indices of thyroid hormone action in liver and kidney of D rats could be related to alterations in nuclear T3 receptor concentrations and the concentration of T3 bound to the receptor.\r"

The degree of increase of acetoacetate (AcAc) in adult rats (50-week-old) after a 36-h fasting period in both normal and diabetic rats was significantly smaller than that of young rats (8-week-old). Plasma total carnitine tended to decrease with aging. On the other hand, the plasma levels of FFA and glucagon in fasted adult rats were significantly higher than those in young rats. In parallel with the in vivo observation, the basal output of AcAc, but not 3-hydroxybutyrate, from adult rat livers was significantly smaller than that of the young normal and diabetic rats. The level of glucagon-stimulated AcAc output from the young rat liver was significantly higher than that from the adult rat liver in both the normal and diabetic rats. This study demonstrates that the hepatic unresponsiveness to glucagon in terms of its ketone body production by aging may be one of the major causes of hyperosmolar nonketotic coma in elderly people.\r"

  ".U": "87190118\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the aromatase activity in human endometrial stromal cells was stimulated by progestin and enhanced by estrogen and forskolin (Fk), an agent that stimulates the accumulation of intracellular cAMP. Present study was undertaken to investigate whether any peptide hormone would affect endometrial aromatase activity. Stromal cells were isolated from normal proliferative and secretory endometria and cultured in nutrient medium. Porcine relaxin (RLX) was added to culture medium individually or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and estradiol (E2). Cells treated with RLX alone did not affect the aromatase activity. RLX, however, exerted a synergistic effect on aromatase activity in the presence of MPA or MPA plus E2. On the other hand, human CG, epidermal growth factor, human PRL, and insulin did not increase the aromatase activity in the presence or absence of MPA and E2 studied in a limited number of specimens. The progestin-dependent effect of RLX on aromatase activity was dose dependent indicating that the biological effect of RLX is mediated through a saturable mechanism. When RLX was added to MPA-pretreated cells, additional increase of aromatase activity was seen after 24 h incubation indicating that the action of RLX on stromal cells is not an acute effect. Antiprogestin, RU486, inhibited the stimulation of aromatase activity in both MPA and MPA plus RLX treated cells. RLX has either no effect or a moderate increase (up to 2-fold over the control) on intracellular cAMP content. On the other hand, Fk increased the intracellular cAMP level and enhanced the aromatase activity in the presence of progestin. Also RLX did not replace the effect of Fk since additional increase of aromatase activity was noted when stromal cells were incubated with MPA plus RLX plus Fk in comparison to MPA plus RLX or MPA plus Fk. These results suggest that the action of RLX on stromal cells may be mediated through an intracellular messenger independent of cAMP. Present studies provide evidence that RLX exerts a synergistic effect on aromatase activity in the presence of progestin in human endometrial stromal cells. It is evident that human endometrium is a target organ of RLX.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the control of pulsatile insulin secretion by an intrapancreatic pacemaker, samples at minute intervals were taken from the portal vein in dogs in vivo and from an isolated perfused pancreas preparation in vitro. Anesthetized dogs had high amplitude pulsatile insulin secretion which was not consistently regular. Fourier transform analysis showed dominant 20- and 10-min periods of spectral power (P less than 0.01). After vagotomy, the relative oscillatory power was reduced from 83% to 42%, about a lower mean concentration with abolition of the 20-min oscillations. The isolated perfused dog pancreas also had oscillatory insulin secretion with oscillatory power of 12%. Autocorrelation showed regularity of in vitro insulin secretion with a period of 10-11 min (P less than 0.0001). In addition, somatostatin was secreted from the in vitro pancreas in pulses in phase with insulin (cross-correlation P less than 0.0001). These data are in accord with the theory that the pancreas has an internal pacemaker which controls insulin secretion, and that the amplitude of the oscillations is modulated by vagal control. The pacing of the islets may be coordinated by a neural network, whereas coincident pulsatile somatostatin release may temporarily suppress islet secretion and help to synchronize hormonal oscillations.\r"

Clarification as to whether renin and angiotensinogen mRNAs are coexpressed in the same tissues of the same animal species is important for understanding the biology of the tissue renin-angiotensin system. We employed mouse renin cDNA and rat angiotensinogen cDNA to compare tissue distributions of renin and angiotensinogen in RNAs of the rat and mouse. Both cDNA probes readily cross-hybridize with the corresponding mRNA of the other species. Our results demonstrate several patterns of distribution. Renin and angiotensinogen mRNAs are readily detected in kidney and adrenals of both species. In brain and heart, angiotensinogen mRNAs are present in concentrations that far exceed renin mRNA levels in these organs in both species. In mouse and rat livers, angiotensinogen, but not renin, mRNA is demonstrated. In rat testis, only renin mRNA can be detected, whereas in mouse testes both renin and angiotensinogen mRNA are present. In CD-1 male mouse submandibular gland, renin mRNA exists in high concentrations, whereas angiotensinogen mRNA is present in low levels. In contrast, neither renin nor angiotensinogen mRNA could be detected in rat salivary gland. In summary, our study demonstrates the widespread codistribution of renin and angiotensinogen mRNAs in many tissues of both species, allowing for the possibility of local angiotensin production. However, tissue and species differences in these gene expressions also exist. Understanding differential tissue expressions of these genes will provide additional important insight into the biology of the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

We studied whether this effect was related to an ability of adenosine to alter the activation of insulin receptor kinase by insulin. It was found that depletion of endogenous adenosine by adenosine deaminase treatment decreases insulin's ability to activate the receptor kinase at submaximal insulin concentrations. This occurred without changes in insulin binding. At 4 ng/ml insulin, adenosine deaminase decreased insulin activation of insulin receptor kinase by 25%, a reduction that equalled the effect of adenosine deaminase on insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose transport. The effects of adenosine deaminase on both insulin activation of insulin receptor kinase and insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose transport were reversed by the addition of N6-phenylisopropyl-adenosine, a nonhydrolyzable adenosine analog. Our data are consistent with the view that adenosine modulates the coupling of insulin binding to biological actions of insulin at or before the level of activation of insulin receptor kinase.\r"

In a 3-day incubation with less than 500 pg/ml human GH (hGH), SF2 was better than the traditional medium in supporting Nb2-11C growth, although the comparative efficiency of SF2 decreased at higher hGH levels. Known growth factors (epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet derived-growth factor, recombinant somatomedin-C, multiplication-stimulating activity) and insulin had no consistent effect on the cell growth in SF2 either in the presence or absence of hGH. Corticosterone (12.4-150 nM) was toxic to the Nb2-11C cells. SF2 could support the growth of Nb2-11C cells for at least 30 passages in the presence of 5 ng/ml hGH, and that of 2 spontaneously proliferating cell lines (Nb2-SP and Nb2-HSP) for the same length of time in the absence of lactogen. However, in all cases the growth rate in SF2 was lower than that seen in the presence of 10% HS. Long-term culture of Nb2-SP and Nb2-HSP cells in SF2 led to an increase of the growth rate with time. There was a change in the responsiveness of Nb2-SP cells to lactogens after long-term culture in SF2 which was only apparent in the presence of HS. After 10 passages in SF2, Nb2-11C cells showed no apparent changes in lactogen-induced growth response, cell phenotype, cell size, or binding capacity for [125I]hGH.\r"

Forskolin mimicked the stimulatory effect on PLMT, and insulin inhibited this effect. In both the absence and presence of insulin, there was a linear relationship between PLMT activity and lipolysis. PLMT activity was also increased in response to oxytocin, which does not activate adenylate cyclase in adipocytes and does not stimulate lipolysis. The effects of oxytocin were inhibited by insulin and were additive with those of isoproterenol on PLMT. These data support the hypothesis that in adipocytes, PLMT is activated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a cAMP-independent mechanism, both of which can be regulated independently, and both of which are sensitive to inhibition by insulin.\r"

  ".U": "87190156\r", 
  ".W": "Two PRL-like glycoprotein hormone complexes were purified from the medium of cultured mouse conceptuses from day 10 of pregnancy: mouse placental lactogen-I (mPL-I) (29-32K), and mPL-I (36.5-42K). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed that mPL-I (36.5-42K) is a complex of five proteins with mol wt of 36.5K, 37.5K, 39K, 40.5K, and 42K. Deglycosylation with peptide: N-glycosidase F or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid produced a single 29K protein. mPL-I (36.5-42K) was also sensitive to neuraminidase, but not to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H or bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The production of intermediates from partial digestion of mPL-I (36.5-42K) with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F indicated the presence of multiple glycosylation sites. mPL-I (29-32K) is a complex of three proteins with mol wt of 29K, 30.5K, and 32K. Treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid reduced the mol wt of the 30.5K and 32K bands to 28K. The 30.5K band was sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F, but the 32K band was not. Neither band was sensitive to neuraminidase or bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The 29K band was resistant to all chemical and enzymatic treatments and is probably not glycosylated or phosphorylated. In the nonreduced state, neither form of mPL-I showed an increase in mobility over that of its reduced counterpart on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, indicating that neither form of mPL-I contains the large disulfide loop common to hormones of the PRL family. After iodination, all component proteins of both forms of mPL-I were found to bind to day 17 pregnant mouse liver membranes and were displaceable by excess mPL-II. In a radioreceptor assay, 125I-labeled mPL-I (36.5-42K) was displaced by mPRL or mPL-II, but not by mGH. An antiserum to both forms of mPL-I was generated, and a RIA employing mPL-I (36.5-42K) as the standard and radioligand was developed. Dilutions of day 10 pregnant maternal mouse serum and placental homogenate and a partially purified fraction of mPL-I (29-32K) produced displacement curves parallel to that of mPL-I (36.5-42K) standard curve. Five micrograms of mPRL, mPL-II, or mGH or 10 microliter day 17 pregnant or male mouse serum did not displace the radioligand from the antibody. mPL-I (36.5-42K) was lactogenic, but it did not possess LH-like bioactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Ectopic pregnancy is the shady companion of tubal surgery. Among patients with ectopic pregnancy, relatively few have a history of tubal surgery as their underlying etiologic factor when compared with other etiologies such as PID. Nevertheless, a history of tubal surgery should place the patient at a higher-risk group for ectopic pregnancy; 3% to 20% of these patients will encounter an ectopic pregnancy after the corrective surgery. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy after tubal surgery is extremely variable and is closely linked to the degree of restoration of normal functional and anatomic integrity after the surgical procedure. This depends, to a large extent, on the amount of previous damage to the tube and its potential reversibility. Major improvements in surgical technique can, therefore, have reduced, but not eliminated, the occurrence of tubal pregnancy. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy associated with any given tubal surgical procedure should be taken into consideration when surgery is contemplated. When the risk of ectopic pregnancy is unacceptably high, or when the patient is reluctant to be exposed to a high risk of ectopic pregnancy, IVF-ET could be offered as an alternative. Table 11 represents the incidence of ectopic pregnancy associated with the various surgical procedures. The figures demonstrate the wide variation in outcome for the same procedure.\r"

For examination of this question, the immunobead binding technique was used to identify IgA, IgG, and IgM ASA in the serum, semen, and follicular fluid (FF) of 40 couples undergoing IVF-ET. ASA binding to sperm tail tip did not predict the fertilization rate of uniformly inseminated mature oocytes. Similarly, ASA binding to sperm head in semen and male serum did not predict fertilization. However, the fertilization rate in couples with ASA to sperm head (ASA-H) of at least one isotype in female serum (n = 6) was significantly less than in those without ASA-H (n = 34; 34% versus 74%, P less than 0.01). Among these women, oocyte fertilization rates were 33% versus 71% (P less than 0.001). Sixty percent of women whose ova did not fertilize (n = 5) had ASA-H in their serum versus 6% of those whose ova did (n = 35; P less than 0.05). The presence of ASA-H in FF also correlated with fertilization. ASA-H in female serum reduced the zygote cleavage rate from 91% to 67% (P = 0.51). We conclude that the presence of ASA-H in female serum and FF is associated with reduced fertilization in IVF-ET.\r"

Two SPAs were done on each subject. Ninety-seven percent of the VARIs showed less than 15% penetration on a single test, and 91% showed less than 15% on both tests. On a single test 61% of the VARNs and 68% of the VARFs were less than 15%. If 0 penetration were used as the criteria of infertility, then 40% of the VARIs, 27% of the VARFs, and 12% of the VARNs would be classified as being infertile.

  ".W": "The inhibitory action of insulin and proinsulin on basal and glucagon-activated glycogenolysis was studied in cultured rat hepatocytes containing [14C]glycogen. Insulin or proinsulin given as sole hormones in the presence of 5 mM glucose decreased basal release of [14C]glucose from [14C]glycogen to 20%. Half-maximal effective concentration of insulin was approximately 0.15 nM and of proinsulin was approximately 5 nM. Inhibition of [14C]lactate release from [14C]glycogen required slightly higher hormone concentrations with a similar difference in potency for insulin and proinsulin. The glucagon-stimulated release of [14C]glucose was completely blocked by insulin or proinsulin with half-maximal effective concentrations of approximately 0.2 and approximately 8 nM, respectively. In contrast, release of [14C]lactate in the presence of glucagon was increased slightly by insulin and proinsulin. Basal and glucagon-activated phosphorylase activity was inhibited by approximately 50% in a dose-dependent manner by both hormones, with differences in potency similar to those for the inhibition of glycogenolysis. These data point to a direct regulatory role of insulin in the control of hepatic glycogen breakdown even when acting as sole hormone. The results do not support the notion of a preferential inhibitory potency of proinsulin on hepatic glycogenolysis.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of plasma glucagon levels on the blood glucose response to intravenous insulin administered continuously or in a pulsatile manner. Six type I diabetic patients proven to have no residual insulin secretion were investigated. Endogenous glucagon secretion was inhibited by a continuous intravenous infusion of somatostatin (100 micrograms/h) and replaced by exogenous infusions of the hormone at three different rates (7.5, 4.5, and 2.5 micrograms/h), resulting in three different plasma glucagon steady-state levels (i.e., approximately equal to 200, approximately equal to 130, and approximately equal to 75 pg/ml, respectively). Each subject, in random order and on different days, was infused intravenously with regular human insulin either continuously (0.17 mU X kg-1 X min-1) or with the same amount of insulin infused in a pulsatile manner (0.85 mU X kg-1 X min-1 during 2 min followed by 8 min during which no insulin was infused). At plasma glucagon levels approximately equal to 200 pg/ml, blood glucose rose from approximately 10 to approximately 13 mM without any difference between the two modalities of insulin infusion. For plasma glucagon levels approximately equal to 130 pg/ml, plasma glucose remained steady throughout the experiments, but during the last 40 min, plasma glucose levels were significantly lower when insulin was administered intermittently. This greater blood glucose-lowering effect of pulsatile insulin occurred earlier and was more pronounced for plasma glucagon levels averaging 75 pg/ml. We conclude that the greater hypoglycemic effect of insulin administered intravenously in a pulsatile manner in type I diabetics critically depends on plasma glucagon circulating levels.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperinsulinism has been associated with infection and endotoxin shock in rodents, dogs, and humans. In dogs with Escherichia coli-induced endotoxin shock, this hyperinsulinism was in response to glucose administration. To determine the role of endogenous opiates in endotoxin-induced glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinism, plasma beta-endorphin, Met-enkephalin, Leu-enkephalin, insulin, and glucose concentrations were measured for 6 h in fasted, anesthetized dogs given LD70 of E. coli endotoxin; endotoxin and glucose; endotoxin, glucose, and naloxone (an opiate antagonist); glucose and naloxone; or glucose alone. Plasma endogenous opiate immunoreactivity was elevated in dogs that received endotoxin, regardless of the presence of glucose or naloxone. The elevation of plasma Met-enkephalin and beta-endorphin preceded the onset of hyperinsulinism, but the elevation of plasma Leu-enkephalin did not. Plasma insulin was elevated 100-fold by 360 min in dogs given endotoxin and glucose. The magnitude of this hyperinsulinism was markedly reduced by naloxone, supporting the hypothesis that endogenous opiates are involved in the development of the glucose-stimulated hyperinsulinism associated with endotoxin shock. Interestingly, naloxone, given in conjunction with glucose, appeared to have a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that a nonimmunoreactive analogue of somatostatin, (D-Ala5, D-Trp8)-somatostatin, differentially inhibits pancreatic somatostatin secretion without inhibiting insulin or glucagon secretion. During normoglycemia, suppression of pancreatic somatostatin with this analogue increases glucagon and insulin secretion, suggesting that pancreatic somatostatin tonically inhibits glucagon and insulin secretion by a paracrine mechanism. In our study, we used this analogue to determine whether endogenous pancreatic somatostatin has a role in the inhibition of glucagon secretion by hyperglycemia. The experiments were performed in pentobarbital-anesthetized, laparotomized dogs. To measure the pancreatic output of somatostatin directly, pancreatic venous blood was sampled from the right lobe of the dog pancreas, and the pancreatic blood flow was measured. In the first set of experiments, glucagon secretion was suppressed by a glucose infusion (200 mg/kg bolus and 20 mg X kg-1 X min-1 i.v.) for 3 h. Plasma glucose rose from 102 +/- 6 to 365 +/- 34 mg/dl. Pancreatic insulin output increased 10-fold, pancreatic somatostatin output increased from 1.2 +/- 0.3 to 3.0 +/- 0.8 ng/min, and pancreatic glucagon output was suppressed from 1.4 +/- 0.7 to 0.5 +/- 0.1 ng/min. After 2 h of glucose infusion, an infusion of the analogue (5.5 micrograms/min i.v.) reversed both the stimulation of somatostatin and the suppression of glucagon without significantly changing either the plasma glucose level or the pancreatic insulin output. In a second set of experiments, basal somatostatin output was suppressed by the analogue (5.5 micrograms/min i.v.) for 15 min before the administration of glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mechanisms underlying cerebral loss in this model are unknown, but abnormalities of the vascular supply with prolongation of the route of diffusion might play a role.\r"

Herein, we measured urinary insulin clearance during oral glucose tolerance tests in proband with abnormal insulinemia (44-yr-old female), three affected family members, two unaffected family members, two other hyperinsulinemic patients with obesity, five non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients, and five normal control subjects. Urinary insulin-to-creatinine clearance ratio in the proband and her affected family members was 0.22 X 10(-3) +/- 0.07 (mean +/- SD, n = 4) and was markedly reduced compared with those of other groups: 1.73 X 10(-3) in two unaffected family members, 2.77 X 10(-3) in two other hyperinsulinemic patients with obesity, 2.99 X 10(-3) +/- 1.48 in five non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients, and 2.54 X 10(-3) +/- 0.67 in five normal control subjects. In contrast, urinary C-peptide clearance in these groups was not significantly different from controls. Binding of immunopurified insulins extracted from urine of the patients with abnormal insulinemia to guinea pig kidney membrane was slightly decreased (71% of standard insulin), in contrast with the observation that serum insulin of the proband had much less receptor-binding activity. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the immunopurified insulin of the proband revealed that the ratios of normal insulin to abnormal insulin were 8:3 in urine and 1:7 in serum, respectively. These results suggest that excretion of abnormal insulin in urine is much less than that of normal insulin.\r"

To partially elucidate this issue we have studied seven obese subjects with the euglycemic clamp technique with a low-dose insulin infusion rate of 15 mU X m-2 X min-1 over 3 h. Basal insulin levels were 24 +/- 7 microU/ml and increased to steady-state levels of 35 +/- 3 microU/ml during insulin infusion. Endogenous insulin secretion, quantitated by C-peptide measurements, decreased by 58% of the basal value after peripheral insulin infusion. Based on C-peptide measurements and the contribution of the peripheral insulin infusion to the circulating insulin concentrations, calculated portal insulin levels either decreased or remained unchanged during the clamp studies. Basal glucagon levels were 165 +/- 18 and did not change during the insulin infusion. The basal glucose disposal rate was 86 +/- 2 mg X m-2 X min-1 and did not increase significantly during the clamp studies. In contrast, hepatic glucose output (HGO) was suppressed by 82 +/- 5% of the basal value. In summary, in a group of insulin-resistant obese subjects, glucose-clamp studies were performed at peripheral insulin levels of 35 +/- 3 microU/ml; glucose disposal did not increase, whereas HGO was suppressed by 82%. At the same time, glucagon levels remained constant and estimated portal insulin levels either decreased or remained unchanged. These findings suggest that insulin can suppress HGO through indirect extrahepatic actions.\r"

The insulin sensitivity and responsiveness of glucose transport in freshly isolated adipocytes were significantly reduced in NIDDM subjects compared with nondiabetics. This was due in part to decreased insulin binding in adipocytes. Reduced specific 125I-labeled insulin binding was also observed in crude detergent extracts and partially purified insulin receptors from adipose tissue. In addition, the basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity per milligram of protein was significantly decreased in NIDDM patients compared with nondiabetics. The differences between maximally insulin-stimulated and basal kinase activities expressed by insulin-binding activity were also significantly reduced in NIDDM subjects. We conclude that insulin resistance in morbidly obese patients with NIDDM is due to both insulin-binding and postbinding defects. One of the postbinding defects in NIDDM appears to be impaired insulin-receptor kinase activity of fat tissue.\r"

In the basal state, 4 wk-old obese rats were hyperinsulinemic (159 +/- 8 vs. 82 +/- 9 microU/ml), whereas glucose turnover rate was similar to that observed in lean rats (14.9 +/- 1.9 vs. 12.5 +/- 1.9 mg X min-1 X kg-1). Glucose utilization was identical in skeletal muscles, whereas it was increased in white adipose tissue of obese rats (22 +/- 4 vs. 8 +/- 2 ng X min-1 X mg-1). At plasma insulin level of 500 microU/ml, glucose production was totally suppressed in both groups, whereas overall glucose utilization was slightly less in 4-wk-old obese than in lean rats. This was due to a reduced stimulation of glucose utilization in skeletal muscles and brown adipose tissue. In contrast, glucose utilization in periovarian white adipose tissue was similarly increased in lean and obese rats. For a maximal insulin concentration (1500 microU/ml), all the differences were abolished between lean and obese young Zucker rats.

We studied whether the variation in IDDM preponderance with age, sex, and genetic background in vivo is reflected in different susceptibility to IL-1 toxicity of islets in vitro. In addition, we studied the effect of preculture conditions that support endocrine islet cell function and decrease nonendocrine passenger-cell survival on the susceptibility of beta-cells to IL-1 because it is unknown whether IL-1 acts directly on beta-cells or via passenger cells. No differences in susceptibility to various doses of IL-1-containing mononuclear cell supernatants were found between islets isolated from newborn or adult rats, male or female rats, or rats of four inbred strains, indicating that age, sex, and genetic background do not influence the susceptibility of the beta-cell to IL-1. Preculture of islets for 1-7 days in normal atmosphere and preculture of islet clusters in 95% O2 to delete passenger cells did not affect IL-1-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that IL-1 acts directly on beta-cells. Increasing the glucose concentration (22 mM) in the culture medium, which is known to protect beta-cells against alloxan toxicity, reduced IL-1 toxicity. Five or 25% normal human serum as well as 5% normal rat serum, but not equivalent concentrations of human serum albumin, inhibited IL-1 toxicity, indicating the presence of IL-1 inhibitors, IL-1 antagonists, or beta-cell-protecting factors in normal serum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Genetically diabetic Chinese hamsters were selected from a subline (L) known for subnormal pancreatic insulin release and excessive pancreatic glucagon release in vitro. 86Rb accumulation in 1 mM glucose was normal in the diabetic islets. Similar to the pattern of 86Rb efflux previously seen from normal rat and mouse islets, 20 mM glucose suppressed 86Rb efflux within 1-2 min, and efflux remained suppressed until return to 1 mM glucose in both normal and diabetic hamster islets. After the first 2 min of 20 mM glucose, suppression of 86Rb efflux was somewhat greater in the diabetic hamster islets than in the normals. In addition, glucose-stimulated insulin release and 45Ca uptake were significantly reduced in the diabetic islets. Therefore, in the diabetic hamster islets, there is at least no impairment in the initial suppression of 86Rb efflux by glucose. This suggests that the diabetic beta-cells recognize glucose and carry out the initial steps in the stimulus-secretion coupling sequence normally. The later, excessive suppression of 86Rb efflux may be due to impaired Ca2+-induced changes in 86Rb efflux, suggesting that defective regulation of intracellular Ca2+ activity, rather than defective regulation of K+ permeability, may lead to the impaired insulin secretion.\r"

The suggestion that insulin deficiency leads to insulin resistance, a prominent feature of human NIDDM, led us to examine insulin binding and glucose transport in the NSIR during the development of hyperglycemia. Male Wistar rats were injected at 2 days of age with STZ (90 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle alone. Mild insulin deficiency, reflected by minimally decreased fed plasma insulin concentrations, was apparent at 4 wk (mean +/- SE, control vs. NSIR, 2.32 +/- 0.19 vs. 1.75 +/- 0.21 ng/ml) and at 8 wk. Pancreatic insulin content was dramatically reduced in NSIR to 12 and 5% of control values at 4 and 8 wk, respectively (P less than .001). Fed plasma glucose concentrations increased in the NSIR between 4 and 5 wk and were significantly elevated at 8 wk (251 +/- 25 vs. 527 +/- 52 mg/dl, P less than .001). 125l-labeled insulin binding showed a progressive increase as a function of adipocyte volume in control and NSIR. Epididymal fat pad weights and adipocyte volumes were significantly decreased in the NSIR. Thus, insulin binding did not differ when expressed per cell number but was increased in NSIR when corrected for cell size (percent specific binding X 10(2), 8.49 +/- 0.96 vs. 11.56 +/- 1.08/microliter cell vol; P less than .05, all ages combined).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of restoration of euglycemia with the artificial beta-cell (Biostator GCIIS) on triglyceride metabolism was studied in seven normolipidemic patients with type I diabetes mellitus. Very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG) transport was determined with [3H]glycerol as an endogenous precursor of VLDL-TG; the resultant kinetic data were evaluated by multicompartmental analysis. Studies of triglyceride metabolism were performed in diabetic patients taking their usual dose of subcutaneous insulin (control study) and after 72 h of euglycemia with the artificial beta-cell (Biostator study). Treatment with the artificial beta-cell resulted in a decrease in mean (+/- SE) 24-h plasma glucose levels from 199 +/- 9 to 123 +/- 7 mg/dl and an increase in mean plasma free-insulin levels from 12.3 +/- 1.9 to 27.6 +/- 4.2 microU/ml (P less than .05). These changes were accompanied by a decrease in mean plasma TG levels from 134 +/- 29 to 88 +/- 15 mg/dl (P less than .05). Kinetic studies demonstrated that the change in plasma triglyceride levels was primarily due to a decrease in VLDL-TG transport (i.e., synthesis), which fell from 11.7 +/- 2.5 mg X h-1 X kg-1 ideal wt during the control study to 7.5 +/- 2.0 mg X h-1 X kg-1 ideal wt during the Biostator study (P less than .05). There was no significant change in fractional catabolic rates of VLDL-TG between the two studies (0.35 +/- .05 vs. 0.38 +/- .07 h-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle is thought to be involved in the major diabetic complication atherosclerosis. We have previously reported an increase of growth-promoting activity (GA) in platelets from insulin-dependent diabetics. In this study, GA was measured in the platelet extract (PE) from eight diabetic patients who had been treated by conventional insulin therapy. Vascular smooth muscle cells from rat aorta were cultured and used as an assay system for GA. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA of cultured cells was stimulated by diabetic PE significantly more (P less than .05) than by normal PE. Diabetic PE incubated with cells for 4 days increased cell numbers significantly more (P less than .05) than normal PE. These abnormalities were corrected by long-term intensive insulin treatments (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and Pen infuser). The decrease of platelet extract GA appeared to correlate with the amount of insulin administered before meals as short-acting boluses, whereas the level of basal or long-acting insulin appeared to correlate with an increase of PE GA. Thus, the growth-promoting potential of platelets can be normalized by intensive insulin therapy. The relationship of insulin levels to this activity needs further evaluation.\r"

  ".U": "87191446\r", 
  ".W": "Somatostatin has been widely used to suppress endogenous pancreatic hormone secretion in research studies. Many of these studies required the simultaneous infusion of a hormone together with somatostatin. A critical assumption for its use in metabolic investigation is that somatostatin has no effect on the action or clearance of a concomitantly infused hormone. To test whether clearance of an exogenously infused hormone is affected, we infused insulin with or without somatostatin in two sets of studies. Insulin (40 mU X kg-1 X h-1) was infused for 100 min (n = 6). Plasma glucose levels fell to 55 +/- 4.1 mg/dl with insulin alone and significantly lower, to 44 +/- 1.9 mg/dl, when somatostatin (250 micrograms/h) was also infused (P less than .01). Plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) rose to 57 +/- 12.5 microU/ml with insulin alone, which was significantly different from 88 +/- 15 microU/ml when insulin was infused together with somatostatin (P less than .01). When a smaller dose of insulin (30 mU X kg-1 X h-1) was infused for 100 min (n = 4), similar results were observed. When somatostatin was infused together with insulin, plasma glucose fell to lower levels (41 +/- 4.2 vs. 62 +/- 9.5 mg/dl; P less than .01) and plasma IRI rose higher (39 +/- 8.5 vs. 27 +/- 5.9 microU/ml; P less than .01) than when insulin was infused alone. C-peptide was equally suppressed by hypoglycemia regardless of whether somatostatin was administered, indicating suppression of endogenous insulin during these studies. We conclude that somatostatin infusion impairs the clearance of exogenous insulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report the production of mouse monoclonal antibodies against human proinsulin with biosynthetic human proinsulin (produced by recombinant DNA technology) as immunogen. Four monoclonal antibody-producing cell lines were obtained from two separate fusions. Two of the antibodies had affinity constants for intact proinsulin of 3.1 X 10(10) and 5.6 X 10(10) L/mol and bound all forms of proinsulin and insulin. Cross-reactivity with intact proinsulin was greater than with 65-66 and 32-33 split proinsulins and des 64-65 and des 31-32 proinsulins. The third antibody had an affinity constant for intact proinsulin of 6.3 X 10(10) L/mol and reacted only with intact proinsulin, 65-66 split proinsulin, and des 64-65 proinsulin; there was no reaction with 32-33 split proinsulin, des 31-32 proinsulin, or C-peptide.

Insulin, C-peptide, and 32-33 split proinsulin did not react in the assay up to a concentration of 100 pM. The 65-66 split proinsulin and des 64-65 proinsulin reacted with a potency of approximately 55% relative to intact proinsulin.

  ".W": "Oral glucose administration to normal humans stimulates insulin release and simultaneously enhances the action of insulin by producing a rapid increase in tissue insulin sensitivity by a mechanism separate from the amount of hormone released. We determined whether insulin-resistant patients with myotonic dystrophy lose the ability to produce the normal rapid increase in tissue insulin action after oral glucose. Nine ambulatory, nonobese men with myotonic dystrophy were studied with 120-min euglycemic insulin infusions (20 mU X m-2 X min-1) given before and after glucose ingestion (4 and 5 patients received 15- and 25-g loads, respectively). Identical studies were performed in nonobese normal volunteers (16 and 13 patients received 15- and 25-g oral glucose loads, respectively). Glucose infusion rates at 20-120 min (GIR20-120) during euglycemic insulin infusions without prior glucose were 2.87 +/- 0.6 mg X kg-1 X min-1 in patients with myotonic dystrophy compared to 4.70 +/- 0.3 mg X kg-1 X min-1 in normal subjects. Euglycemic insulin infusions after glucose ingestion were begun after arterialized blood glucose values had returned to baseline. After glucose ingestion by normal subjects, GIR20-120 increased by 44.4 +/- 7.1% (P less than .0001) and by 46.8 +/- 8.6% (P less than .0002) with 15- and 25-g glucose loads, respectively. GIR20-120 in the nine patients with myotonic dystrophy showed no significant increase after glucose ingestion. These results confirmed the existence of a decrease in whole-body insulin sensitivity in myotonic dystrophy and indicated that the patients lack the normal mechanism that enhances insulin action after oral glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The medium and the cell extract were chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 column, and radioactivity eluting in the position of intact insulin was concentrated and analyzed on HPLC. The HPLC analysis of the cell extract showed two major products eluting from the column at 19 and 23 min, whereas medium extracts showed one prominent product eluting at 14 min. Inclusion of chloroquine in the incubation blocked the formation of cellular products at 19 and 23 min and caused the accumulation of a product eluting at 41 min while not affecting the media products. After sulfitolysis all cellular products contained an intact A-chain. Dansylcadaverine increased media products and altered the cell-extracted product pattern such that it had a major peak at 14 min, similar to media. These results suggest that two pathways for insulin degradation exist within hepatocytes. The extracellular process forms products that are essentially unchanged by chloroquine and dansylcadaverine. The intracellular process is altered by chloroquine and apparently inhibited by dansylcadaverine.\r"

In addition, abnormality in the direction of blood flow could be detected by pulsed Doppler examination. Ultrasonography is relatively inexpensive, readily accessible, does not require administration of radiation or contrast agents and therefore should be the primary non-invasive investigation of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome, or those at risk of developing it.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and twelve consecutive Child Class A and B cirrhotic patients were included in a prospective controlled trial aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic sclerotherapy vs. distal splenorenal shunt in the elective treatment of hemorrhage from esophagogastric varices. Fifty-seven patients were randomly allocated to splenorenal shunt and 55 to endoscopic sclerotherapy. Since only 4 of the 55 patients assigned to endoscopic sclerotherapy had to be excluded after randomization and before treatment as compared to 14 of the 57 patients assigned to splenorenal shunt, it is suggested that the applicability of endoscopic sclerotherapy is greater than that of splenorenal shunt. One patient in each group died within 30 days of the procedure and two in the endoscopic sclerotherapy group were lost to follow-up just after discharge. Variceal rebleeding during follow-up occurred in 37.5% (18/48) of patients in the endoscopic sclerotherapy group and in 14.3% of those in the splenorenal shunt group (6/42) (p less than 0.02), whereas hepatic encephalopathy was more frequent in patients submitted to splenorenal shunt (10/42, 24%) than in those treated by endoscopic sclerotherapy (4/48, 8%) (p less than 0.05). The therapeutic modality was the only variable with independent predictive value for rebleeding during follow-up, whereas for hepatic encephalopathy, the therapeutic modality, and the presence of encephalopathy related to the bleeding episode each showed independent predictive value. Early and long-term mortality, did not differ between the two therapeutic groups, being the 2-year survival was 71% for splenorenal shunt and 68% for endoscopic sclerotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Heavy diffuse bleeding from congested gastric mucosa (congestive gastropathy) was treated by propranolol (dose = 24 to 480 mg per day) in 14 consecutive patients with portal hypertension. Thirteen patients (93%) stopped bleeding within 3 days. Gastric mucosal cherry red spots (a sign of severe gastropathy) were unchanged in 5 patients, became less obvious in 4 and appearances returned to normal in 5. Propranolol was discontinued electively in seven patients after 2 to 6 months; four of these patients rebled from the same lesion and stopped bleeding when propranolol was recommenced. No patient has rebled from congestive gastropathy while receiving propranolol during follow-up of 12 to 42 (median = 23) months. A further 24 patients with nonbleeding congestive gastropathy received 160 mg long-acting propranolol per day in a double-blind placebo controlled cross-over trial. Twenty-two patients completed the study; in nine patients, endoscopic grading of congestive gastropathy improved after propranolol compared to three after placebo (p less than 0.05). Although the mechanism of action is not understood, propranolol appears to have a clinically significant role in the management of nonvariceal gastric bleeding in portal hypertension.\r"

The anti-liver-kidney microsome antibody-positive sera were used to study the localization of the liver-kidney microsome antigen in hepatocytes. Immunoblot analysis of microsomal subfractions, lysosomal membranes, plasma membranes, mitochondria and purified ribosomes obtained from rat liver demonstrated that this antibody recognizes a protein of 50 kD present only in endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Immunogold labeling of ultrathin frozen sections and immunoperoxidase staining of 11 to 15 micron cryostat sections were used to detect the liver-kidney microsome antigen in rat liver tissue. The anti-liver-kidney microsome antibody binds to antigenic domains on the cytoplasmic face of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes of hepatocytes. No labeling was observed of the Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes, mitochondria, lysosomes, nuclei or plasma membranes. Not only was the antigen recognized by the anti-liver-kidney microsome antibody specific for endoplasmic reticulum membranes, but it was also specific for the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes only, since no labeling was observed in any organelle of Kupffer or endothelial cells. Therefore, the anti-liver-kidney microsome antibody can be considered as a marker for endoplasmic reticulum in rat hepatocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The acute vanishing bile duct syndrome can be defined as an irreversible, rejection-related condition that affects hepatic allografts within 100 days after orthotopic liver transplantation and whose presence requires retransplantation. We have observed the acute vanishing bile duct syndrome in 5 of 48 consecutive patients (approximately 10%) who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. In 4 cases, the condition progressed relentlessly within approximately 7 to 11 weeks after orthotopic liver transplantation from mild rejection to severe rejection to acute vanishing bile duct syndrome. A fifth patient had severe rejection in the first week and required retransplantation after 17 days because of thrombotic venoocclusive disease complicating the acute vanishing bile duct syndrome. Clinically, signs of impending acute vanishing bile duct syndrome included abrupt onset of fever and jaundice and marked elevation of serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels which persisted despite antirejection treatment. Biopsy specimens revealed destructive cholangitis (rejection cholangitis), ductopenia, and, if retransplantation was delayed, presence of noninflammatory, \"burnt-out\" portal tracts without bile ducts. We recommend to base the diagnosis of acute vanishing bile duct syndrome on documentation of severe ductopenia in at least 20 portal tracts which may require several consecutive needle biopsies. Rejection arteriopathy which was found in 3 of our 5 cases might have been another important diagnostic clue but could not be recognized prior to retransplantation. The pathogenesis of acute vanishing bile duct syndrome is not clear; until the condition had manifested itself, we found no qualitative differences between acute reversible and irreversible rejection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Transplanted patients (n = 13) were more likely to survive (p less than 0.05), were younger (p less than 0.05) and spent more time in the hospital (p less than 0.025) than did those who were not transplanted (n = 16). Despite spending a much longer time in the hospital, transplanted patients spent less time in the intensive care unit (p less than 0.05) in coma (p less than 0.01) and on a respirator (p less than 0.01) than did those not transplanted. Most importantly, the survival rate for transplanted patients was significantly improved (p less than 0.05) as compared to those not transplanted. We conclude that liver transplantation can be applied successfully to the difficult clinical problem of fulminant and subacute hepatic failure.\r"

Three antibodies (K-PLC1, K-PLC2 and K-PLC3) showed evidence of carcinoma-associated reactivity by indirect immunofluorescence. Antibodies K-PLC2 and K-PLC3 reacted only with PLC/PRF/5 cells, but not with any other normal or malignant cell type tested, including the Hep/G2 hepatoma cell line. The reactivity of these antibodies was not removed by absorption with homogenates of either normal liver or a primary hepatocellular carcinoma. These results suggest that K-PLC2 and K-PLC3 identify PLC/PRF/5 idiospecific determinants. Following surface iodination of PLC/PRF/5 cells, immunoprecipitation and analysis on polyacrylamide gels, these specific determinants were found to be of 200,000 and 76,000 daltons, respectively. On the other hand, antibody K-PLC1, although unreactive by immunofluorescence on the majority of normal cell types, including those of lymphoid organs and bone marrow liver cells and most epithelia, was weakly positive on some normal ductal secretory epithelia and was positive on vascular endothelium. However, K-PLC1 reacted strongly with all carcinoma specimens tested, and with most carcinoma-derived cell lines, indicating a large increase in K-PLC1 antigen expression by epithelial cells after malignant transformation. Absorption of K-PLC1 with normal liver homogenate had no affect, but absorption with a hepatocarcinoma homogenate abolished its activity. The K-PLC1 antigen could not be immunoblotted or immunoprecipitated and resolved on polyacrylamide gels; yet it showed the properties of a phospholipid, namely resistance to proteases, extractability with organic solvents and sensitivity to phospholipase C.\r"

During treatment, serum levels of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen decreased in all 10 treated patients, but in none of five controls (p less than 0.05). Also during therapy, ALT activity decreased by an average of 50% and serum IgG levels by 30% (both p less than 0.05). Serum levels of hepatitis B virus DNA and DNA polymerase activity did not change significantly. Four to 10 weeks after discontinuation of prednisolone, a rebound of serum ALT and IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen levels occurred, which usually resolved within the subsequent months of follow-up evaluation. In three patients, however, there was a prolonged exacerbation of the disease following prednisolone withdrawal; in these three, levels of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and ALT remained elevated above pretreatment values. The close correlation between changes in serum ALT activity and IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen levels suggests that corticosteroids can modulate disease activity in chronic type B hepatitis by suppression of the host-immune response to hepatitis B virus antigens.\r"

Responses to postural stress (change from supine to sitting position) following phlebotomy were also compared in a second group of subjects. Before phlebotomy, supine plasma hormone levels did not differ in the two groups. After phlebotomy, both groups exhibited only slight decreases (5 mm Hg) in systolic BP and a transient rise in heart rate. Only plasma norepinephrine increased significantly in both groups (35% above control in normal and 43% in hypertensive subjects). Similar results were obtained in a second group of normal and hypertensive subjects, who were also subjected to a 10-minute postural challenge after phlebotomy. After 10 minutes in a sitting position, BP in these subjects remained unchanged but heart rate and plasma norepinephrine increased further to levels almost twice that produced by phlebotomy alone. Plasma epinephrine levels and PRA also increased with this additional stress, but plasma vasopressin remained unchanged. Changes in BP, heart rate, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine, and PRA did not differ significantly between the two groups. These data indicate that hypertensive subjects are as capable as normal subjects of maintaining BP when subjected to standard phlebotomy, the sympathetic nervous system appears to be the predominant pressor mechanism activated following an acute, nonhypotensive blood loss in both groups of subjects,(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Angioplasty caused a considerable decrease in blood pressure in 15 of the 21 patients. In 12 of these 15 patients, captopril induced changes in the time-activity curves of the affected kidney only, suggesting deterioration of the excretory function of that kidney, while the function of the contralateral kidney remained normal. After angioplasty the asymmetry in the time-activity curves diminished despite identical pretreatment with captopril. Such captopril-induced unilateral impairment of the renal function was not seen in the six patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis whose blood pressure did not change after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or in 13 patients with hypertension and normal renal arteries. The functional impairment of the affected kidneys was characterized by a decrease of 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid uptake and a delay of 131I-hippurate excretion, while the 131I-hippurate uptake remained unaffected. These data are in agreement with a reduced glomerular filtration rate and diuresis during preservation of the renal blood flow, changes that can be expected after converting enzyme inhibition in a kidney with low perfusion and an active, renin-mediated autoregulation of the glomerular filtration rate. These data suggest that functional captopril-induced unilateral changes, shown by split renal function studies with noninvasive gamma camera scintigraphy, can be used as a diagnostic test for renovascular hypertension caused by unilateral renal artery stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mortality associated with ARF in these settings remains unacceptably high. Evaluation of the oliguric patient must include thorough monitoring for, and correction of, prerenal and postrenal causes of oliguria. In this sense, diagnosis of ARF is one of exclusion. Differential diagnosis is facilitated by microscopic examination of urine and by biochemical analyses of blood and urine for calculating indices of tubular function (urinary-to-plasma ratios of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, sodium excretion, and clearances of sodium, creatinine, solute, and water). The early detection of an intrarenal defect, as accomplished by using serial measurements of free water clearance, may allow interruption of the process and prevention of ARF. Preventive measures include optimization of hemodynamic status and the use of osmotic diuretic agents (mannitol) and loop diuretics (furosemide, ethacrynic acid, and bumetanide). Dopamine is useful for increasing both renal blood flow and urine flow and may be useful for preventing ARF, but this is not firmly established. Experimentally, other approaches such as modulating the renin-angiotensin system, prostaglandin system, and cellular calcium fluxes have been attempted, but the clinical applicability of these measures is not established. The best approach to ARF is preventing it by knowing which patients are at high risk, by studiously preventing renal insults, and by aggressively treating early indications of renal malfunction using established therapies.\r"

The type and severity of the initial injury are the major determinants of outcome. Trauma prevention is therefore a compelling social goal. Skillful and timely resuscitation efforts favorably affect survival statistics. Even though detailed outcome data do not yet exist in all areas regarding pre-existing illness, it is clear that underlying disease may directly cause trauma, may necessitate modification in trauma management, and may even adversely effect the health-care providers themselves.\r"

However, the problems of massive transfusion are not insurmountable. More important than achieving an adequate blood pressure in the hemorrhaging patient is the need to reestablish adequate tissue perfusion, thus maintaining oxygen transport and appropriate tissue oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption will decrease after hemorrhagic shock, reflecting a metabolic deficit at the cellular level, and may contribute to end-organ failure. Through blood transfusion, the oxygen consumptive needs of the tissues can be met. Whether the blood administered is autologous or homologous, no superior medium for oxygen transport is yet available. Close attention to the hazards associated with massive transfusion will result in improved outcome and decreased mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Overall, no ideal induction or maintenance technique is available for the traumatized, hypovolemic patient. As a result of the multiple insults that produce hypovolemia and the heterogeneous population of patients sustaining trauma, it is unlikely that a controlled human study of this anesthetic dilemma will ever be performed. One must balance the potential incidence of recall of operation or unacceptable sympathectomy-induced vasodilation against the anesthetic techniques available. Bogetz and Katz addressed the recall issue by documenting how many patients sustaining major trauma and requiring operation were really anesthetized. They stressed that many of the patients evaluated were too hemodynamically unstable to tolerate the usual dose of anesthetics administered during elective operations. They postulated that hypotension, hypothermia, and acute alcohol intoxication found in many trauma patients should make recall infrequent. Two groups of patients were analyzed for incidence of recall. The groups were separated based on the continuity of anesthetic administered. In 37 patients given ketamine for induction and low-dose inhalational agent for maintenance, with no gaps in anesthetic administration of over 20 minutes, 4 of 37 (11%) patients had recall. Recall was reported by 6 of 14 (43%) patients in whom it was considered clinically unwise to administer an anesthetic for intubation or whose anesthetic needed to be interrupted for more than 20 minutes secondary to hemodynamic instability. If these figures are representative of the worldwide incidence of recall in our traumatized patients, we may need to redefine the role of anesthesia in trauma. We may need to consider ourselves, not inappropriately, resuscitologists rather than anesthesiologists.\r"

Maximal muscle strength was determined in 58 patients and maximal cardiovascular capacity was assessed in 36 patients. Before dialysis there was a 31 percent reduction in muscle strength in men and 47 percent in women. The loss of muscle strength was most pronounced in the leg extensors. Cardiovascular capacity and muscle strength was positively correlated in the dialysis patients (p less than or equal to 0.05). The cardiovascular capacity was decreased 29% in predialysis patients, 45% in dialysis patients and 37% in transplanted patients compared to untrained healthy controls. The predialysis patients had a 19% greater cardiovascular capacity than the dialysis patients and a 9% greater cardiovascular capacity than the transplanted patients. While hemoglobin concentrations showed a positive correlation (p less than or equal to 0.05) with maximal cardiovascular capacity and creatinine concentration showed a negative correlation (p less than or equal to 0.05) with maximal cardiovascular capacity in the predialysis patients, hemoglobin concentrations and creatinine concentrations did not correlate with cardiovascular capacity in the dialysed and transplanted patients. In dialysis patients as well as in patients after kidney transplantation hemoglobin and creatinine concentrations, muscle strength, height, weight, and age are factors influencing the physical work capacity, but none of these variables alone seems to be a strong determination factor. Besides the complications of kidney disease which may itself reduce physical fitness, the lack of physical training is an important factor in determining the residual muscle strength and cardiovascular capacity for all patients with renal insufficiency.\r"

Insulin and growth hormone production increased (p less than 0.05) only with the high glucose bath, and no hemodynamic differences were noted during either dialyses. We then compared lipid profiles of 18 patients for 6 months, changing the glucose dialysate concentrations in each patient after three months. We found that all patients had hypertriglyceridemia, mild hypercholesterolemia, low HDL, normal LDL, and high VLDL cholesterol. We therefore conclude that episodic hyperinsulinemia and episodic excessive growth hormone secretion do not contribute significantly to the lipid abnormalities of the dialysis patients.\r"

  ".W": "In many sheep Escherichia coli endotoxin results in pulmonary hypertension, increased microvascular permeability, pulmonary edema, and increased central venous pressure. Since lung lymph drains into the systemic veins, increases in venous pressure may impair lymph flow sufficiently to enhance the accumulation of extravascular fluid. We tested the hypothesis that, following endotoxin, elevating the venous pressure would increase extravascular fluid. Thirteen sheep were chronically instrumented with catheters to monitor left atrial pressure (LAP), pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and superior vena caval pressure (SVCP) as well as balloons to elevate LAP and SVCP. These sheep received 4 micrograms/kg endotoxin, and following the pulmonary hypertensive spike the left atrial balloon was inflated so that (PAP + LAP)/2 = colloid osmotic pressure. It was necessary to control PAP + LAP in this way to minimize the sheep-to-sheep differences in the pulmonary hypertension. We elevated the SVCP to 10 or 17 mmHg or allowed it to stay low (3.2 mmHg). After a 3-h period, we killed the sheep and removed the right lungs for determination of the extravascular fluid-to-blood-free dry weight ratio (EVF). Sheep with SVCP elevated to 10 or 17 mmHg had significant increases in EVF (5.2 +/- 0.1 and 5.6 +/- 1.2) compared with the sheep in which we did not elevate SVCP (EVF = 4.5 +/- 0.4). These results indicate that sustained elevation in central venous pressure in patients contributes to the amount of pulmonary edema associated with endotoxemia.\r"

Plasma arginine vasopressin increased variably and insignificantly. The cardiovascular response (heart rate, systemic arterial and pulmonary arterial pressures, left ventricular filling pressure, and calculated total peripheral and pulmonary arteriolar resistance) closely paralleled that of human subjects. Increased hemoglobin concentration was induced by exercise in the dogs. The ventilatory response of the animals was characterized by respiratory alkalosis. These data suggest similarities between canine and human subjects in norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone responses to submaximal exercise. Apparent species differences during submaximal exertion include greater alterations of plasma epinephrine concentration and a respiratory alkalosis in dogs.\r"

Sequential measurements were made of cardiac dimensions, [left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (EDD), changes in diameter (delta D%), wall thickness (WTh), wall thickening (WTh%), left ventricular pressure (LVP), time derivative of pressure (dP/dt), stroke volume, total body O2 consumption (VO2), blood gases, and systemic hemodynamics] at rest and during moderate and severe exercise. Postmortem studies included morphometric measurements of capillary density, arteriolar density, mitochondria, and myofibrils. All of the exercise-trained pigs showed significant increases in aerobic capacity. Maximum O2 consumption (VO2 max) increased by 37.5% in group 1 (moderate exercise training) and 34% in group 3 (heavy exercise training). Cardiac hypertrophy ranged from less than 15% in a group (n = 8) subjected to moderate exercise training to greater than 30% in a group (n = 11) subjected to heavy exercise training. Before training, exercise was characterized by a decreasing EDD during progressive exercise; this was reversed after exercise training. Stroke volume and end-diastolic volumes during exercise showed a highly significant increase after exercise training and hypertrophy. Morphometric measurements showed that mitochondria and cell membranes increased with increasing myocyte growth in all exercise groups, but there was only a partially compensated adaptation of capillary proliferation. Arteriolar number and length increased in all exercise groups. Intrinsic contractility as measured by delta D%, WTh%, or left ventricular dP/dt did not increase with exercise training and in some instances decreased. Therefore, left ventricular adaptation to strenuous exercise in the pig heart is primarily one of changes in left ventricular dimensions and a compensated hypertrophy. Exercise-induced increases in EDD and stroke volume can be accounted for by decreases in peripheral resistance and increased cardiac dimensions.\r"

We measured the early pulmonary arterial pressure responses after injections of the monosaccharides lipid X (2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate) and MAGP (2-monoacylglucosamine 1-phosphate), of the tetraacyl disaccharide diphosphate precursor of lipid A, IV-A (Federation Proc. 43: 1567, 1984), and of Escherichia coli bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). We also measured the response of lipid X after prior administration of indomethacin and MAGP. Lipid X, at a total cumulative dose of 40 micrograms/kg, produced an immediate, but transient dose-dependent pulmonary arterial vasoconstrictive response. MAGP, at a total dose of 40 micrograms/kg, had no pulmonary pressure activity but did increase extravascular lung water and produce some histological changes in the lung. Disaccharide precursor IV-A, at a total dose of 40 micrograms/kg, produced an immediate dose-dependent pulmonary arterial vasoconstrictive response that was prolonged for greater than 2 h. E. coli endotoxin caused a delayed (15-min) increase in the pulmonary arterial pressure but one that also persisted for greater than 2 h. Prior administration of indomethacin blocked the pulmonary pressor activity of lipid X, whereas prior administration of MAGP increased both the magnitude and the duration of the pulmonary pressure response of lipid X. We conclude that the initial pulmonary hypertension seen after lipid X injection may involve cyclooxygenase-dependent formation of prostaglandins and that the genesis of this pulmonary pressor activity is at least in part dependent on the ester-linked hydroxymyristoyl moiety at position 3 of the lipid X molecule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Because the presence of bronchial smooth muscle reactivity in infants remains controversial, airway reactivity was assessed in 10 normal, asymptomatic male infants less than 15 mo of age by measuring the changes that occurred in the maximal expiratory flows at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC) during a methacholine bronchial challenge test. Sleeping infants inhaled doubling concentrations of methacholine by 2 min of tidal breathing, starting with a concentration of 0.075 mg/ml, and the bronchial challenge was stopped when VmaxFRC decreased by at least 40%. The threshold concentration of methacholine required to produce a decrease in VmaxFRC by 2 SD's of the control value was 0.43 mg/ml (0.11-0.90). By a methacholine concentration of 1.2 mg/ml, all infants decreased VmaxFRC by at least 40% (range 40-75%), and the mean dose required to produce a 40% decrease was 0.72 mg/ml. The airway reactivity was not related to base-line flows. During the methacholine challenge, no infant developed wheezing, but the percent oxygen saturation for the group decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) from 94 to 92%. Following the methacholine, the infants inhaled the bronchodilator metaproterenol, and 10 min later, VmaxFRC returned to base line. This study demonstrates that infants exhibit airway reactivity as evidenced by bronchoconstriction with methacholine and the subsequent bronchodilation with metaproterenol.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) causes lung injury that occasionally progresses to the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We measured the effect of 10 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on small solute and protein flux in dogs 1 wk before and 2 h after the completion of CPB. As an index of alveolar epithelial permeability, the clearance from lung to blood of inhaled technetium-99m-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) was measured. To assess microvascular endothelial integrity, the rate of accumulation in the lung interstitium of intravascular 113mIn-transferrin was measured. The clearance half time (t 1/2) for 99mTc-DTPA in the study dogs declined from 18.8 +/- 1.9 min (mean +/- SE) at base line to 9.4 +/- 2.0 min during PEEP (P less than 0.05). Two hours after CPB, the t 1/2 was 8.1 +/- 1.6 min at base line and unchanged during PEEP. The 113mIn-transferrin rate of accumulation was unchanged by PEEP before CPB. After CPB, the index was 3.25 +/- 0.95 slope/min X 10(-3) (P less than 0.05). Of the five dogs with a significant slope, four showed a decrease in microvascular flux during PEEP, although for the group the mean change in slope was not significant (P = 0.10). We conclude that the application of PEEP does not increase 99mTc-DTPA clearance in lungs already injured by CPB, and may actually decrease the apparent microvascular protein flux in some cases.\r"

Upper airway resistance (Ru) increased from a control value of 0.48 +/- 0.04 cmH2O X ml-1 X s (mean +/- SE) to 0.85 +/- 0.15 after 128 mg/ml MCh, whereas lower airway resistance (Rlo) increased from 0.11 +/- 0.03 to 0.21 +/- 0.04. However, there was no correlation between the magnitudes of the changes in Ru and Rlo. In a further seven anesthetized spontaneously breathing rats aerosols of MCh were delivered into the lower airways via a tracheostomy and resulted in increases in Rlo from a control value of 0.20 +/- 0.03 to 0.66 +/- 0.12 after 128 mg/ml MCh. Ru also increased to approximately double its control value. We conclude that inhaled MCh causes narrowing of both Ru and Rlo in the anesthetized rat, the changes in Ru and Rlo are not correlated, and changes in Ru can occur when MCh deposition occurs only in the lower airways.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of lung volume on the bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled aerosolized methacholine (MCh) in seven normal subjects. We constructed dose-response curves to MCh, using measurements of inspiratory pulmonary resistance (RL) during tidal breathing at functional residual capacity (FRC) and after a change in end-expiratory lung volume (EEV) to either FRC -0.5 liter (n = 5) or FRC +0.5 liter (n = 2). Aerosols of MCh were generated using a nebulizer with an output of 0.12 ml/min and administered for 2 min in progressively doubling concentrations from 1 to 256 mg/ml. After MCh, RL rose from a base-line value of 2.1 +/- 0.3 cmH2O. 1-1 X s (mean +/- SE; n = 7) to a maximum of 13.9 +/- 1.8. In five of the seven subjects a plateau response to MCh was obtained at FRC. There was no correlation between the concentration of MCh required to double RL and the maximum value of RL. The dose-response relationship to MCh was markedly altered by changing lung volume. The bronchoconstrictor response was enhanced at FRC - 0.5 liter; RL reached a maximum of 39.0 +/- 4.0 cmH2O X 1-1 X s. Conversely, at FRC + 0.5 liter the maximum value of RL was reduced in both subjects from 8.2 and 16.6 to 6.0 and 7.7 cmH2O X 1-1 X s, respectively. We conclude that lung volume is a major determinant of the bronchoconstrictor response to MCh in normal subjects. We suggest that changes in lung volume act to alter the forces of interdependence between airways and parenchyma that oppose airway smooth muscle contraction.\r"

  ".W": "The lung epithelial permeability to inhaled solutes is primarily attributed to the degree of distension of the interepithelial junctions and thus of the alveolar volume. To assess this hypothesis, a submicronic aerosol of technetium-99m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (99mTc-DTPA) was inhaled by eight normal subjects in left lateral decubitus (LLD). The regional lung clearance of 99mTc-DTPA was measured in LLD, then in right lateral decubitus (RLD) to reverse the relative distension of the alveoli. Although in LLD the deposition of the aerosol is the greatest in the gravity-dependent regions of the left lung, their 99mTc-DTPA clearances are significantly lower than those of the nondependent regions of the right lung (0.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 2 +/- 0.8%/min, P less than 0.001). In RLD, these regions placed in opposite positions significantly reversed their clearances (1.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.2%/min, P less than 0.001). Results indicate in lateral decubitus a gravity gradient of 99mTc-DTPA clearances independent of the aerosol deposition. This gradient of epithelial permeability to solutes appears to be influenced by the gradient of alveolar volume.\r"

It is usually seen in women of late child-bearing age as a variably painful and tender swelling over the medial end of the clavicle. Radiographs show sclerosis and slight expansion of the medial one-third of the clavicle. Although malignant tumor of bone must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a disease that has such radiographic findings, numerous and expensive screening tests for a presumed primary malignant lesion are not recommended for most patients. It is recommended, however, that an excisional or (preferably) incisional biopsy be performed in all patients unless pain is insignificant and the clinical presentation strongly supports the diagnosis of condensing osteitis. Many patients who have slight pain do not need treatment. Anti-inflammatory medications are variably effective. Patients in whom the lesion is refractory respond well to excision of the medial one-third of the clavicle.\r"

The same general pattern was noted when antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was assayed. There was measurable cell-mediated immunity to donor cells from six weeks after surgery onward, although no distinct pattern or differences between experimental groups were noted. Higher titers of anti-DLA antibody were found in synovial fluid than in serum; in fact, synovial antibody was detectable when systemic antibody was not. Joints that received DLA-mismatched grafts had the highest titer of antibody and the intra-articular response was significantly reduced when the graft had been frozen.\r"

Twenty-three biopsies were performed in sixteen patients from nine to seventy-eight months after transplantation. No clear relationship could be established between the degree of histocompatibility of the donor and the recipient and the incorporation of the graft, probably in part due to the number of variables involved and the polymorphism of the HLA system. However, no early massive resorption of the transplant was seen in this series, in which, by the design of the protocol, no recipients had pre-existing circulating antibodies to the antigens of the donor. Two allografts showed infiltration by round cells and vascular lesions in the absence of infection, which is suggestive of an immune response against antigens from the donor. Both matched poorly with the donor for HLA antigens. The individual who had the strongest reaction was the only recipient in the series who had a massive failure of the transplant.\r"

The men were given continuous iv infusions of 0.15 M saline (5 h), dopamine (4 micrograms/kg X min; 1 h), GHRH (2 ng/kg X min; 2 h), and GHRH (2 ng/kg X min; 2 h) plus dopamine (4 micrograms/kg X min; 1 h) on four separate occasions, and serum GH responses were measured. In a second study, on separate days, placebo or bromocriptine (2.5 mg/dose) was administered, and GH and PRL responses to a single iv GHRH dose were measured. A continuous infusion of dopamine and GHRH on separate days stimulated GH secretion in all subjects. The mean integrated GH secretion was 13.2 +/- 3.1 (+/- SEM) ng/mL X h during the dopamine infusion and 14.7 +/- 4.6 during GHRH, compared with 1.7 +/- 0.4 during the saline infusion. The combination of GHRH and dopamine resulted in the greatest stimulation of GH secretion (29.8 +/- 5.7 ng/ml X h; P less than 0.05 vs. 3 other study days). The oral dopamine agonist bromocriptine also augmented GHRH-stimulated GH secretion. Integrated GH secretion after a single iv injection of GHRH following two doses of bromocriptine was 160 +/- 29.5 ng/ml X h compared with 81.3 +/- 22.2 after placebo (P = 0.04). We suggest that these findings are compatible with the hypothesis that dopamine inhibits hypothalamic somatostatin secretion, which then allows for a greater stimulatory effect of GHRH.\r"

  ".U": "87195263\r", 
  ".W": "Two insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors, the type I and type II IGF receptors, have been described. While substantial evidence indicates that the type I receptor is involved in the regulation of cell division, it is uncertain if the type II receptor also mediates this response. Similarly, the role of the insulin receptor in mediating DNA synthesis remains controversial. To address these questions, we used a monoclonal antibody (alpha IR-3) to specifically inhibit type I IGF receptor activity and examined the effects of this inhibition on IGF- and insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in human fibroblasts. WI-38 human embryonic lung fibroblasts have both type I and type II IGF receptors, as determined by cross-linking [125I] IGF-I and [125I]IGF-II to monolayers of these cells. In serum-free medium both IGF-I and IGF-II stimulate DNA synthesis in WI-38 fibroblasts, with half-maximal effects occurring at 1.5 +/- 0.3 (+/- SD) and 3.4 +/- 1.4 nM, respectively. At maximally effective concentrations, however, both hormones stimulate DNA synthesis to equal levels. alpha IR-3 binds to the type I, but not the type II, IGF receptor on WI-38 cells. It also inhibits IGF binding to the type I receptor on these cells. alpha IR-3 competitively inhibited both IGF-I- and IGF-II-stimulated DNA synthesis in WI-38 cells, but had no effect on either epidermal growth factor- or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis. These results indicate that in WI-38 fibroblasts the mitogenic effects of both IGF-I and IGF-II are mediated through the type I receptor and that the type II IGF receptor is not directly involved in this response. To define the role of the insulin receptor in mediating DNA synthesis we compared the effects of alpha IR-3 on insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in a variety of human cell lines under identical experimental conditions. With WI-38 and HEL, another human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line, alpha IR-3 competitively inhibited the mitogenic effect of insulin. However, in two other fibroblast cell lines (GM498 and HES) and an osteogenic sarcoma cell line (MG63), alpha IR-3 inhibited IGF, but not insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis. These results indicate that human cell lines differ in the receptor type through which insulin stimulates DNA synthesis and that these differences are intrinsic properties of the cell lines and are not artifacts resulting from differences in experimental conditions.\r"

The plasma insulin response to oral glucose inversely correlated with the M value (r = -0.60; P less than 0.001), being highest in those with the lowest M (quartile 1) and lowest in those with the highest M (quartile 4). On the other hand, the plasma glucose responses of the 4 quartiles were virtually identical. These results document that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake varies widely in subjects with normal glucose tolerance, and that these differences are independent of any change in the plasma glucose response to oral glucose. Furthermore, the results indicate that insulin resistance in normal individuals is associated with hyperinsulinemia.\r"

To investigate the role of CRH in the plasma ACTH response to hypoglycemia, two different doses of ovine CRH (oCRH) were given to normal men during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. We hypothesized that if the endogenous CRH response to hypoglycemia were less than maximally stimulating, administration of oCRH during hypoglycemia would result in a greater peak plasma immunoreactive (IR) ACTH response. Six normal men were given 1) 0.15 U/kg regular insulin, iv; 2) insulin plus 1 microgram/kg oCRH, iv, 5 min after serum glucose fell to 40 mg/dL or less; and 3) oCRH alone. The degree and duration of hypoglycemia were the same when insulin was given alone or with oCRH. Plasma IR-ACTH after insulin alone and insulin plus oCRH rose at the same rate to similar peaks of 226 +/- 37 (mean +/- SEM) and 213 +/- 53 pg/mL, respectively, both of which were greater (P less than 0.05) than the peak plasma IR-ACTH after oCRH alone (61 +/- 19 pg/mL). The peak plasma IR-cortisol levels after insulin alone (24 +/- 4 micrograms/dL), insulin plus oCRH (27 +/- 3 micrograms/dL), and oCRH alone (18 +/- 2 micrograms/dL) were not significantly different. In a second study, six normal men were given 0.15 U/kg regular insulin, iv; insulin plus 10 micrograms/kg oCRH, iv; and 10 micrograms/kg oCRH alone. Administration of oCRH 5 min after serum glucose fell to 40 mg/dL or less did not affect the degree or duration of hypoglycemia. Plasma IR-ACTH after insulin alone and insulin plus oCRH rose at the same rate to similar peaks of 258 +/- 14 and 290 +/- 33 pg/mL, respectively, both of which were greater (P less than 0.01) than the peak (54 +/- 6 pg/mL) after oCRH alone. After insulin alone, plasma IR-ACTH declined to baseline by 3 h. However, after insulin plus oCRH, plasma IR-ACTH fell gradually until 2 h, rose to a second peak at 2.5-3 h, and remained greater (P less than 0.01) than after insulin or oCRH alone for the 4-h duration of the study. The mean peak plasma IR-cortisol level after insulin plus oCRH (33 +/- 4 micrograms/dL) was similar to that after insulin alone (28 +/- 3 micrograms/dL), but was greater (P less than 0.05) than that after oCRH alone (18 +/- 2 micrograms/dL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Forty-nine members of 6 families with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) were investigated with a standardized meal stimulation test to detect the presence of pancreatic endocrine tumors. Fifteen age-matched subjects and 4 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism also were studied. Serum pancreatic polypeptide (PP), gastrin, and insulin as well as plasma glucagon and somatostatin concentrations were determined before and during the test meal. Patients with demonstrable pancreatic endocrine tumors had significantly increased mean basal and peak serum PP (P less than 0.001) and gastrin (P less than 0.001) responses to the meal compared with healthy family members and normal subjects. Seven of 12 MEN 1 patients with parathyroid and pituitary disease but no demonstrable pancreatic endocrine tumors had exaggerated PP and/or gastrin responses to the meal; 4 of them developed pancreatic endocrine tumors, detected by abdominal computerized tomography, 0.5-4 yr later. None of the healthy members of the MEN 1 families or the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism had responses different from those of the normal subjects. Our experience with the meal stimulation test indicates that an elevated basal or exaggerated serum PP and/or gastrin response is an earlier sign of pancreatic involvement in the MEN 1 trait than is abdominal computerized tomography.\r"

Effective suppression of gonadotropin secretion was correlated with increased circulating concentrations of immunoassayable GnRH antagonist. Inhibition of gonadotropin secretion was achieved by a parenteral dose of 300 micrograms/kg GnRH antagonist. This dose reduced plasma bioactive LH concentrations by 49-59%, immunoactive LH by 41-46%, and immunoactive FSH by 25-40%. Blockade of gonadotropin secretion was sustained for 10-28 h after a single injection of the synthetic decapeptide. This prolonged action was associated with significant plasma protein binding of the GnRH antagonist and mean plasma half-times of disappearance of 1.5 and 21 h for the fast and slow components, respectively. In summary, we have described the biological actions of a potent GnRH antagonist that binds avidly to serum proteins, has a prolonged plasma residence time, and exerts sustained inhibitory effects on bio- and immunoactive LH release in man. The extended duration of action of this compound may reflect in part its significant binding to circulating plasma proteins.\r"

  ".W": "We used the rat interstitial cell testosterone (RICT) bioassay to assess biological LH activity secreted in response to endogenous and low dose exogenous GnRH pulses in normal men. The absence of nonspecific plasma effects in the LH bioassay was demonstrated by the finding of undetectable levels of LH bioactivity despite low but measurable immunoactivity in 10 hypogonadotropic men. Moreover, bolus injections of human LH in 6 hypogonadotropic men defined a curvilinear relationship between plasma bioactive and immunoactive LH concentrations, in which the extrapolated concentration of plasma bioactive LH at a zero dose of immunoactive LH was indistinguishable from zero. Zero bioactive LH intercepts were also found when physiological bio- and immunoactive LH concentrations derived from 7 intensively sampled normal men were subjected to linear regression using 2-dimensional error fitting. In these men, exogenous low dose (10 micrograms) iv GnRH administration resulted in preferential release of bioactive LH, with a consequent significant increase in the median plasma bio- to immunoactive (bioimmuno) LH ratio. This pattern mimicked that of endogenous LH pulsatility, in which median intrapulse bio:immuno LH ratios were significantly higher than median interpulse ratios in the same individuals (P = 0.006). Increases in spontaneous plasma bio:immuno LH ratios were not attributable to spurious rises in bioactive LH concentrations associated with decreases in serum immunoactive LH levels. Rather, sample cross-correlation analyses demonstrated positive correlations between bio- and immunoactive LH at lags of 0-40 min, indicating that both hormones increased or decreased concomitantly. These results demonstrate that LH is secreted physiologically in pulses of increased biological activity, presumably reflecting the release of a functionally compartmentalized LH pool relatively enriched in biologically active hormone. Accordingly, evaluation of the plasma bio:immuno LH ratio can provide a useful and sensitive index of qualitative changes in the LH molecule in response to endogenous (spontaneous) and exogenous GnRH stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "87195286\r", 
  ".W": "The rat ovary contains significant amounts of a GnRH-like protein, but does not contain readily detectable GnRH. We, therefore, determined whether human ovaries contain a similar GnRH-like protein. Extracts of human ovaries as well as rat ovaries, rat hypothalami, and rat plasma were examined for their content of both GnRH-like protein and GnRH. GnRH-like activity was detected by inhibition of binding of GnRH to rat ovarian membrane receptors [radioreceptor assay (RRA)]. GnRH was detected with a specific GnRH RIA. Equivalent amounts of GnRH-like activity were found in both human and rat ovaries, whereas GnRH was not detected. The human and rat ovarian GnRH-like materials had identical retention times after reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and these were clearly different from that of authentic GnRH. Furthermore, the ovarian GnRH-like activity was clearly separated by HPLC from GnRH and GnRH-like activities extracted from rat hypothalami. Plasma contained neither GnRH-like nor GnRh activity. The ovarian GnRH-like activity was protease and heat sensitive, whereas hypothalamic GnRH and GnRH-like activity were protease sensitive, but not heat sensitive. The ovarian GnRH-like protein did not inhibit the specific binding of prostaglandin F2 alpha to rat ovarian membranes under conditions of assay similar to the GnRH RRA. The ovarian GnRH-like protein did not have GnRH peptidase activity, its inhibition of GnRH binding in the RRA was reversible, and bacitracin (protease inhibitor) had no effect on assay of the ovarian GnRH-like protein by RRA. We conclude that the human ovary contains a GnRH-like protein similar, if not identical, to the GnRH-like protein of the rat ovary, which is different from GnRH and the GnRH-like protein of the hypothalamus. The presence of the same GnRH-like material in human and rat ovary raises the possibility that this protein may mediate responses in the human ovary similar to the antigonadotropic actions of GnRH in the rat ovary.\r"

  ".W": "The plasma catecholamine response to hypoglycemia was studied in a group of hypopituitary patients with Sheehan's syndrome before (group A) and after (group B) combined cortisol and thyroid hormone treatment as well as in a group of normal women (group C). The mean basal plasma norepinephrine (NE) level was significantly increased in group A compared to levels in groups B and C, in which values were similar. The mean basal plasma epinephrine (E) level was not significantly altered by hypopituitarism. The plasma NE response to hypoglycemia was similar in the three groups, while the plasma E response was blunted in groups A and B. However, the plasma E response was significantly decreased only in half of the patients. The basal E/NE ratio was similar in the three groups, but it was significantly decreased in groups A and B compared to that in group C at the peak. From these data we conclude that 1) hypopituitarism is characterized in the basal state by increased adrenergic tone, probably related to secondary hypothyroidism; and 2) during hypoglycemia adrenal stimulation is impaired only in some patients. The role of ACTH in the regulation of E secretion is minor. Impaired neurogenic regulation in some patients with Sheehan's syndrome could contribute to their illness.\r"

Insulin binding was decreased in obesity due to reduced number of binding sites but no differences were observed in insulin binding between obese subjects with or without NIDDM. The structural characteristics of the receptors, as determined by affinity labeling methods and electrophoretic mobility of the beta-subunit, were not altered in obese or NIDDM compared to normal weight subjects. Furthermore, the ability of insulin to stimulate the autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit and the phosphoamino acid composition of the phosphorylated receptor were the same in all groups. However, insulin receptor kinase activity was decreased in obesity using Glu4:Tyr1 as exogenous phosphoacceptor without any appreciable additional defect when obesity was associated with NIDDM. Thus, our data are supportive of the hypothesis that in muscle of obese humans, insulin resistance is partially due to decreased insulin receptors and insulin receptor kinase activity. In NIDDM the defect(s) in muscle is probably distal to the insulin receptor kinase.\r"

Spotted cells are highly proliferative, as evidenced by the nuclear staining with the antibody Ki67, and were found in the bone marrow from most of the myeloma patients studied. This type of cell was also present in patients with immunocytomas, in some cases of benign monoclonal gammopathy, and in patients in the state of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. IgG subclass distribution of so-called spotted cells and plasma cells, found in a patient with pseudo biclonal gammopathy, indicates that spotted cells are intermediate between B cells and plasma cells.

We investigated the role of elevated renal ammonia levels and the interaction of ammonia with the complement system in this injury. Potassium deficiency was induced in rats by feeding a low potassium diet. Experimental animals received 150 mM NaHCO3 or equimolar NaCl, as drinking water. After 3 wk, NaHCO3 supplemented rats demonstrated decreased ammonia production, less renal hypertrophy, less histologic evidence of injury, and less proteinuria. In in vitro studies on normal cortical tubular fragments, the addition of ammonia to serum in concentrations comparable to renal cortical levels in potassium-deficient animals significantly increased tubular deposition of C3 as quantitated by a radiolabeled antibody binding technique. Thus, alkali supplementation reduced chronic tubulointerstitial disease in a rat model of hypokalemic nephropathy. We propose that increased cortical ammonia levels contribute to hypokalemic nephropathy through ammonia-mediated activation of the alternative complement pathway.\r"

We tested the effect of PAF receptor antagonists, CV 3988 and SRI 63-441, on endotoxin-induced hemodynamic changes and lung vascular injury. Pretreatment with CV 3988 attenuated systemic hypotension, preserved hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and prolonged survival of awake catheter-implanted endotoxin-treated (20 mg/kg) rats. Pretreatment with SRI 63-441 prevented the depressed hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction after low dose (2 mg/kg) endotoxin. Both CV 3988 and SRI 63-441 blocked the increased extravascular accumulation of 125I-albumin and water in perfused lungs isolated from endotoxin-treated rats. We conclude that PAF is produced in the lung during endotoxemia and may be an important mediator of the systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic changes as well as the acute lung vascular injury after endotoxemia.\r"

In each group of patients, the kinetics of the lymphokine response and the response to mitogens and nonparasite antigens did not differ significantly. In marked contrast, when antigen-induced lymphokine production was examined, most patients with microfilaremia were unable to produce either interleukin 2 (IL-2) or gamma-interferon (i.e., were nonresponders), and the few who could (hyporesponders, generally with quite low microfilaremia levels) did so at levels significantly less than those of patients with elephantiasis, all of whom showed strong responses to parasite antigen. Removal of neither adherent cells or T8+ cells affected the parasite-specific anergy seen in those with microfilaremia, suggesting a state of T cell tolerance to the parasite in patients with this most common clinical manifestation of bancroftian filariasis.\r"

The effect of novobiocin on clonogenic survival and DNA crosslinking due to cisplatin (cDDP) and carmustine (BCNU) was studied. Novobiocin caused synergistic cytotoxicity in Chinese hamster ovary cells exposed to cDDP or BCNU. Novobiocin and cDDP increased the formation of DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks six-fold greater than cDDP alone. The effect was schedule dependent. Novobiocin and cDDP or BCNU markedly reduced in vivo growth of a murine fibrosarcoma without increased host toxicity.

Their mechanisms of action in vivo, however, remain unclear. In comparison to parenteral gold, the pharmacokinetics of a newly available oral compound, auranofin, differ greatly. Auranofin also appears to have specific immunomodulatory actions and to be associated with fewer and milder toxic effects. The role of chrysotherapy in dermatology has been reemphasized recently. It may be used as an adjuvant in pemphigus or other steroid-responsive diseases to help control disease activity and to taper or eliminate corticosteroid therapy more rapidly. Reports on the use of gold in dermatology are otherwise limited. They include one case of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and psoriatic arthritis. The benefits of gold treatment have to be weighed against the risks inherent in its adverse reactions, some of which are serious and unpredictable.\r"

There are, however, specific advantages in certain instances of using a preplanned geometric closure. Utilization of the secondary defect created by movement of a rotation flap permits redirection of the forces of tension of wound closure. Preplanning of advancement flaps allows for selective placement of tissue dog ears and thereby allows for maximal camouflaging of excisional scars. The dynamics of these two flaps are discussed and specific examples illustrating the principles are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "Monitoring human cardiac allograft rejection is currently accomplished by endomyocardial biopsy. Available noninvasive methods for identifying rejection have lacked the necessary sensitivity or specificity, or both, for routine clinical application. In vivo phosphorus-31 (P-31) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used for monitoring phosphorus metabolism in both animal models and humans. In the present study this technique was employed as a noninvasive means to assess the bioenergetic processes that occur during cardiac allograft rejection in a rat model. Brown Norway rat hearts were transplanted subcutaneously into the anterior region of the neck of Lewis rat recipients (allografts). Control isografts employed Lewis donors and recipients. Phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate (PCr/Pi), phosphocreatine to beta-adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP beta), beta-adenosine triphosphate to inorganic phosphate (ATP beta/Pi) ratios and pH of the transplanted hearts were monitored using surface coil P-31 NMR spectroscopy (at 4.7 tesla) daily for 7 days. To allow recovery from the compromise induced by the surgical procedure, the measurements obtained on day 2 were taken as a baseline. PCr/Pi was unchanged or increased in the isografts but decreased continually in allografts, with the difference becoming significant by day 4 when compared with levels in day 2 allografts (p less than 0.005) and by day 3 when compared with levels in the isograft group (p less than 0.05). PCr/ATP beta in isografts did not change throughout the study; however, allografts demonstrated a significant decrease as early as day 3 (p less than 0.01), although a significant difference between isografts and allografts did not become manifest until day 4 (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to be effective in reopening totally occluded arteries in acute myocardial infarction. Coronary thrombus is also believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of unstable angina and non-Q wave infarction. However, few patients with these two acute coronary syndromes have been treated with intracoronary streptokinase. Therefore, 100,000 to 300,000 IU (mean 177,000 +/- 80,000 IU) of intracoronary streptokinase was infused into 36 consecutive catheterized patients who either presented with an acute episode of unstable angina or had had a recent non-Q wave infarction and in whom a less than 100% occluded ischemia-producing artery could be identified. Qualitative techniques utilizing vessel magnification and quantitative analysis with digital subtraction were performed on the ischemia-producing coronary lesion before and immediately after streptokinase therapy and 3 to 10 days later in 18 patients who were restudied at the time of transluminal coronary angioplasty. Before streptokinase treatment, 24 (67%) of 36 ischemia-producing arteries contained eccentric, irregular lesions. The percent diameter stenosis and percent area stenosis in all ischemia-producing arteries averaged 83.8 +/- 8.3% and 94.8 +/- 3.3%, respectively. After streptokinase treatment there were 23 arteries (64%) with eccentric irregular lesions. The percent diameter stenosis and percent area stenosis in all ischemia-producing arteries were similar to pre-streptokinase values (82.9 +/- 5.9% and 93.8 +/- 4.0%, respectively). At restudy, there were also no significant changes in any quantitative or qualitative variable. Five individual patients showed a significant reduction in percent stenosis after streptokinase. This improvement was independent of duration of symptoms, use of heparin before angiography, streptokinase dose or reduction of fibrinogen levels post-streptokinase. Two additional patients deteriorated clinically and developed total occlusion of the ischemia-producing artery within 12 hours of streptokinase infusion. These data suggest that intracoronary streptokinase may be of limited utility in either unstable angina or recent non-Q wave infarction with a less than 100% occluded ischemia-producing artery. In these syndromes, thrombus may be organized or short infusions may be given too late to be effective. In some cases, thrombus may even be absent. Whether longer infusion of streptokinase or other thrombolytic agents will be of benefit remains to be determined.\r"

No statistically significant differences were found between the powder and aerosol formulations with respect to pulmonary function, length of time mean FEV1 remained greater than or equal to 15% above baseline, physicians' assessments of patients' clinical response, or patients' subjective symptom scores. There were also no significant differences between treatment groups in cardiovascular effects, laboratory values, or adverse events. Among patients who expressed a preference for one of the delivery systems, half preferred using the powder.

Glucocorticoid therapy caused prompt resolution of symptoms and disappearance of blood eosinophilia and pulmonary shadowing. Electron microscopy and tissue immunofluorescence studies for major basic protein documented extensive eosinophil degranulation and the presence of free granules within the pulmonary microvasculature. In addition, exfoliation of the alveolar lining cell was observed in association with a clustering of free intact and disintegrating extracellular eosinophil granules against a denuded basement membrane. These findings suggest a cytotoxic potential of the eosinophil at the level of the pulmonary parenchyma in a case of idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.\r"

Dehydrated foods were hidden in capsules or juice and administered twice a day. Antigens were obtained commercially or prepared through a process of freeze-drying and subsequent pulverization. Cutaneous, gastrointestinal, nasal, and/or respiratory symptoms occurred following 133 challenges. Although patients exhibited multiple positive skin tests to foods, 86% experienced a positive response on blinded challenge to only one or two foods. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges accurately diagnose food hypersensitivity and minimize the number of foods eliminated from allergy avoidance diets. A new method of elimination diet management and education is based on the identification of \"key words\" on food labels. Instructional diet sheets were developed to teach this concept, which was found to promote greater confidence, compliance, and creativity in diet planning.\r"

Eighteen healthy young (mean age, 27 +/- 1 standard error of the mean) (SEM) and 18 old (71 +/- 1 SEM) subjects matched for relative weight and socioeconomic group were studied. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed while eating ad lib diet and after being given high (85%), medium (45%), and low (20% to 30%) CHO formula diets for at least three days. A three- to seven-day food record was used to determine the major nutrients including CHO and fiber intake in the ad lib diet at home. Our older subjects consumed significantly less total calories and slightly less carbohydrate but there was no difference in dietary fiber, protein, and fat intake. When studies were performed on matched CHO diets, decreased glucose tolerance was present in the older group. However, the mechanism(s) involved may vary with dietary CHO and with age. During the low CHO formula diet and the medium CHO ad lib diet, impaired insulin secretion was prominent in the elderly but was not present in the young. During the high CHO formula diet, insulin response was adequate in both old and young, but decreased glucose tolerance persisted in the older group, suggesting that insulin resistance may be the major contributing factor. We conclude that decreased glucose tolerance in the elderly is modified by CHO intake, but is present even when dietary CHO variability is acutely controlled.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-nine (30%) articles used a mental health measure. Measures of cognitive function were most common, being used in 32 (25%) of the articles reviewed. Twenty-three (18%) studies measured abnormal mental experiences and 17 (13%) articles measured behavioral disorder. Many articles used measures or determinations with no established reliability. Twenty-six of the articles which used a mental health measure also used a measure of activities of daily living or physical function. Retrospective and prospective studies were similar in number. A minority of articles used control groups, random samples, or prepost measures while a majority (64%) identified an outcome measure. We conclude that nursing home research can be improved by the increased use of reliable measures of cognition and abnormal mental experiences and by the development of reliable measures of behavioral disorder. Study design can be improved by identifying a priori hypotheses and by the increased use of random sampling and control/comparison groups.\r"

Although much is known about resources used for inpatient care for Medicare-age patients, detailed information organized on a per-patient, per-year basis about ambulatory care of these patients is lacking. In order to address this problem and to investigate possible differences in resource use by age groups within the Medicare-age population, a study was made of a primary care group practice in which 523 patients, including 174 patients in the Medicare-age group, were followed for one year to determine their use of ambulatory care resources. A comparison of annual resource use by patients age 75 and over with patients age 65 through 74 showed that patients age 75 and over made more visits for primary care (8.15 vs. 6.46), made more visits to specialty and subspecialty clinics (3.41 vs. 2.33) and had higher total charges for ambulatory care ($749 vs. $623). The pattern of use of specialty and subspecialty clinics suggests that the primary care physicians functioned effectively as gatekeepers because most medical problems were handled without referrals to medical subspecialty clinics. The pattern also suggests that the projected rapid increase between now and the year 2000 in the number of persons age 75 and over may result in a greater than anticipated demand for services provided by ophthalmologists, podiatrists, and otolaryngologists.\r"

In August 1984, a comprehensive clinical data base was compiled for 176 male residents of this VA nursing home. During the next 14 months, 12 men were discharged to other locations and were dropped from the study; among the remaining 166, who comprised the study group of this report, 24 died. The most common immediate causes of death were infections (67%) and cardiac disorders (25%). Twenty of the deaths occurred after transfer to the acute hospital services. Among the 67 items in the clinical data base (including absence or presence of 17 diagnoses and 16 drugs), eight were significantly correlated with death rate. Age and functional impairment were directly related, and inversely related were the following: body weight as percent of ideal, triceps skin fold, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and serum cholesterol. Multivariate analysis showed cholesterol and hematocrit to be the most informative of the eight mortality predictors and to correlate with death independently of age and functional level. Subgroups defined on the basis of combinations of mortality-related attributes differed many fold in their death rates. For example, men with cholesterol less than or equal to 156 mg/dl and hematocrit less than or equal to 41% died at a rate 42 times the rate of men with values above both thresholds. For each mortality-related attribute, death rate varied with the level of the attribute. This relationship extended into the generally accepted \"normal ranges\" for cholesterol, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and albumin.\r"

  ".W": "Caregiver burden has been associated with patient dementia. In this study we tested the hypothesis that caregiver burden and depression are related to patient cognitive impairment. We analyzed records of 127 elderly male patients from a Veterans hospital geriatrics referral clinic. The patients and their informal caregivers had been referred to the clinic because the complexity and multiplicity of their problems were beyond the treatment capability of other clinics. There was a high prevalence of dementia (73%) and depression (69%) in these patients according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) criteria. Quantitative measures of patient dementia and dependency in activities of daily living were not statistically associated with measures of caregiver depression or burden. In contrast, measures of patient depression were significantly correlated with measures of caregiver depression and burden. We hypothesize that caregivers of chronically ill, elderly men cope better with physical and cognitive incapacity than with affective symptoms. Because caregiver support is the most important factor in maintaining a disabled elder in the community, we suggest evaluating patients and caregivers for depression as part of standard practice in geriatric clinical settings.\r"

Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional unreferred article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited concern primarily medical ailments of the elderly but legal, ethical, and sociologic topics are also covered. The references are divided into categories. The first set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, the fourth with the elderly and society, and the fifth with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.\r"

Two hundred and fifty incident cases of prostatic cancer, 238 hospital controls, and 240 neighborhood controls were included. Controls were matched to cases on age, sex, and race. Cases were somewhat more educated than controls. An association was found between prostatic cancer and a history of venereal disease in their sexual partners: odds ratio (OR) = 2.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14 to 6.46 and OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.02 to 4.29 for hospital and neighborhood controls, respectively. Cases had more sexual experiences with prostitutes, although their overall lifetime frequency of sexual intercourse with all partners was somewhat lower. Cases also reported more homosexual partners than controls. The results from the study lend some support to an infectious hypothesis for prostatic cancer. The lower frequency of sexual intercourse (OR = .54, 95% CI = .34 to .83 and OR = .68, 95% CI = .47 to 1.01 for hospital and neighborhood controls, respectively) is also noteworthy and may be indicative of a hormonal difference related to sexual interest or drive.\r"

Serum levels of the pancreatic enzymes were similar in young and elderly adults, with no significant differences between the groups for any of the assays. There was a close correlation between lipase enzyme activity and immunoreactivity in all participants, suggesting that the catalytic activity of lipase was not affected by aging. There were also significant correlations between the levels of immunoreactive lipase protein and immunoreactive trypsin protein, within and between the two groups, suggesting an age-independent relationship between these two pancreatic enzymes.\r"

Studies have shown an approximate 20% incidence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms in patients using aspirin and a 10% incidence in patients using some other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. Because symptom assessment is subjective and may correlate poorly with objective evidence of gastroduodenal injury, studies of endoscopic and fecal blood loss have been used to assess mucosal injury. Whereas high doses of aspirin may produce overt mucosal injury in a majority of patients and normal volunteers, ibuprofen causes significantly less qualitative and quantitative damage in a dose-dependent manner. Daily doses of 1,200 mg of ibuprofen may produce endoscopic injury and fecal blood losses similar to placebo. Although epidemiologic evidence shows a strong correlation of daily aspirin use to gastric ulcer and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, other NSAIDs have not been definitively linked to these lesions; no epidemiologic study has established NSAIDs as a cause of duodenal ulcer or gastric lesions when given in low doses. NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, in low doses can be considered to have low gastroduodenal toxicity.\r"

Although ethanol can affect the thyroid gland and also may directly interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism, most patients with alcoholic liver disease are euthyroid. However, some have mild hypothalamic pituitary axis dysfunction. In persons who chronically and continuously drink alcohol, there are demonstrable biochemical abnormalities similar to the effects of thyroid hormone on the liver. However, a primary pathogenetic role in alcoholic hepatitis has not been proven for this thyroid hormone mimicry. There is good clinical evidence, however, that serum thyroid hormones can serve as prognostic indicators of the course of liver disease.\r"

A detailed psychosocial assessment indicated several areas for cognitive-behavioral intervention. Nine months after the patient began treatment, the frequency of IBS episodes had greatly reduced, he was off narcotic pain medication, and his general health was improved as measured by clinic and emergency room visits. We suggest that psychological interventions of the type described here can be an efficacious and cost-effective treatment for IBS.\r"

  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody 1F5, which is reactive with the CD20 (Bp 35) pan-B cell antigen, was shown to activate resting human peripheral blood B cells into the middle to late G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, in contrast to F(ab')2 fragments of polyclonal anti-mu, 1F5 synergized only weakly with B cell growth factor (BCGF) for DNA synthesis in these cells. We provide evidence that the CD20 molecule and surface immunoglobulin represent two alternative activation pathways in resting B cells. We also show that anti-immunoglobulins, during co-stimulation with BCGF, may play an important role in G1 as well as for the initial cell triggering. Thus, anti-mu in nonmitogenic concentrations was shown to provoke distinct effects on 1F5-pretreated G1 cells, as monitored by increases in cellular volumes as well as in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. Moreover, anti-mu could increase c-myc mRNA levels in 1F5-primed cells, implying that c-myc expression can be regulated in G1 as well as during the initial G0 to G1 transition. Partially purified human BCGF neither induced G1 entry in resting peripheral blood cells nor primed the cells for DNA synthesis. The finding that BCGF did not influence c-myc mRNA levels in resting or in activated B cells suggests that its mitogenic action does not involve the c-myc function.\r"

Further manipulations aimed at preferentially sparing or enhancing the activity of suppressor T cells prolonged skin graft survival in pretransfused mice and led to the presence of suppressor T cells in the spleen of such mice, which were active upon adoptive transfer. These manipulations included the use of pretransplant donor-specific transfusion, administration of ALS or cyclosporin-A, or the use of posttransplant injection with a T suppressor activating factor (SAF). Optimum graft survival was associated with combined treatment when using transfusion, SAF, and cyclosporin-A.\r"

We have combined immunodeficiency genes with the db mutation to determine whether beta cell necrosis and establishment of severe diabetes would occur in the absence of normal T and/or B lymphocyte functions. Inbred mice carrying the recessive mutations, severe combined immunodeficiency (scid), X-linked immunodeficiency (xid), nude (nu), and the Y-linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa), were crossed with strains congenic for the db mutation. The diabetes syndrome was studied in double homozygotes produced in the F2 generation. In another experiment, C57BL/KsJ-db/db males were made T cell function deficient by adolescent thymectomy followed by lethal irradiation and bone marrow reconstitution. None of these manipulations served to prevent the induction of a severe diabetes syndrome in any of the model systems analyzed. Thus, diabetogenesis characterized by massive necrosis of the pancreatic beta cells and atrophy of the pancreatic islets was observed in both the absence of normal T cell function (as assessed by absence of T cell mitogen response) and humoral autoimmunity against beta cell antigens (insulin, retroviral p73). In conclusion, our data indicate that anti-beta cell autoimmunity is not a primary event in the etiopathogenesis of diabetes in the db/db mouse.\r"

In the diabetic group, the extent of monocyte adhesion on fibronectin- and autologous plasma-coated surfaces was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (p less than 0.01 on both types of surfaces). Monocytes adhesion to the plasma-coated surface, but not to the fibronectin-coated surface, could be inhibited by monoclonal anti-Mo-1 antibody in a dose-dependent manner. For diabetic monocyte adhesion, a higher amount of anti-Mo-1 antibody was required to produce a similar extent of inhibition as observed with control monocytes. This indication of increased Mo-1 expression on diabetic monocytes was further confirmed by analyzing the fluorescence intensity of monocytes labeled with the antibody anti-Mo-1. The results of the present study suggest that diabetic monocytes have increased adhesiveness as the result of increased expression of fibronectin and Mo-1 receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Rapid progress in studies of cytokines have clarified their roles in processes of lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation. However, the involvement of these molecules in lymphopoiesis during embryonic development has not yet been well documented. In this study we screened for possible existence of cytokines that influence lymphopoiesis in murine amniotic fluid (AF) obtained from non-autoimmune prone \"normal\" strains of mice (CBA/J, BALB/c, A/J, SWR, and C57B/6) and autoimmune-prone NZB mice. Significant colony stimulating activity-1 (CSA-1)-like activities were found in AF of all of the strains tested, but relatively low activities were present in AF of NZB mice. No interleukin 2 (IL 2) or interleukin 3 (IL 3)-like activities were detected, Weak IL 1-like activity was found in AF of most of the strains tested; however, the results of the standard thymocyte proliferation assays varied with each AF sample. This variation is probably related to the presence of nonspecific inhibitors including alpha-fetoprotein in murine AF. Therefore, pooled AF from CBA and NZB strains of mice were subjected to several purification procedures to assess the actual amount of IL 1-like activity present in murine AF. After (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and hydrophobic phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, the measurable level of IL 1-like activity could be increased significantly. With lentil-lectin affinity chromatography, IL 1-like activity was completely dissociated from CSA-like activity. Moreover, a significantly larger amount of IL 1-like activity was found in NZB AF fractions (approximately sixfold higher). Apparent pI values estimated by preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF) were 5.9, 7.2, and 7.4 in CBA AF fractions, and 6.5 and 7.3 in NZB AF fractions. The NZB AF fraction with pI of 7.3 showed significantly higher IL 1 activity than the other fractions studied. These partially purified molecules were found to be resistant to pH 2 and the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol, but were inactivated by heat (56 degrees C, 1 hr) or trypsin. None of the fractions showed IL 2-like activity but some that had IL 1-like activity induced IL 2 production in a IL 1-dependent, IL 2-producing B lymphoma cell line. Apparent m.w. of these IL 1-like activities were 14,000, 14,500, 17,000, 18,000, and 21,000 in CBA AF fractions, and 15,000, 19,000, and 21,000 in NZB AF fractions according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87196358\r", 
  ".W": "A complement-resistant line of HeLa cells (T638) was derived by serial passage of complement-susceptible HeLa cells in anti-beta 2-microglobulin (b2m) antiserum and complement. The T638 line maintained stable complement resistance when passed for an additional 1500 generations in the absence of antiserum and complement. T638 cells expressed equivalent levels of cell-associated b2m as did the parent HeLa cell line. Furthermore, T638 cells were resistant to killing by complement and anti-HeLa antiserum with specificity for molecules other than b2m. These results indicate that the resistance of T638 cells does not simply reflect loss of anti-b2m binding antigens. We next investigated the mechanism of resistance of T638 cells to complement-mediated killing. Antibody-sensitized HeLa and T638 cells both consumed CH50 activity completely from normal human serum; cytotoxicity was not mediated via the alternative complement pathway. HeLa and T638 cells caused equivalent utilization of C4 from normal human serum in the presence of antibody. Consumption of C2, greater with T638 than with HeLa cells during incubation in serum, was complete when cells bearing purified C1 and limited C4 were incubated with C2. T638 cells bound more 3H-C4 than HeLa cells during incubation in serum, but binding of 3H-C3 by T638 cells was fourfold to fivefold less than by HeLa cells. Finally, we investigated the rate of decay in the capacity of C142 on HeLa and T638 to cleave and deposit 3H-C3. The T1/2 for decay of C142-mediated binding of 3H-C3 on HeLa was 3.9 min, whereas minimal C3 deposition was detected on T638 cells at all time points. These results show that T638 cells evade complement-mediated lysis despite activating early components of the classical complement pathway. The mechanism of resistance is a failure to form an effective C3 convertase.\r"

The results presented demonstrate that at pH 6.4: binding of C5 and Factor B to C3b deposited on human erythrocytes is markedly enhanced; generation of the two C3 convertases, C3(H2O), Bb and C3b,Bb is increased; and control of C3b on human erythrocytes by CR1 and Factor I is diminished. In addition, it was found that rabbit erythrocytes, which activate the human alternative pathway, are also lysed much better at pH 6.4 than at pH 7.4. These results indicate that the optimal pH for the initiation and amplification of the alternative complement pathway, and probably also for the activation of the membrane attack complex, is 6.4.\r"

A sensitive MAb (CA101)-based ELISA for measuring circulating parasite antigen was capable of detecting antigen in the sera of 93% of patients with microfilaremia, 46% of those with lymphatic obstruction, and 56% of patients with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome. Circulating antigen was absent from sera of normal controls, and \"false positives\" were recorded in only two of 17 patients with nonfilarial helminth infections. By ELISA and immunoblot analysis, it was shown that three of the monoclonals raised to this 200 kD antigen were directed to epitopes of phosphocholine (PC). Two MAb (CA86, CA101) were identified as having the T15 idiotype previously associated with antibodies to the PC of pneumococcal teichoic acid; one was untypeable. All three of these anti-PC MAb reacted with adult, microfilaria, and larval antigen preparations, and by immunoblotting showed multiple banding patterns that indicated the presence of PC determinants on many different antigenic molecules. On the other hand, target antigens of CA101 which were found in the circulation of infected patients were limited to three species with apparent m.w. of 200, 160, and 78 kD. The 200 kD antigen was seen more frequently than the other two antigens. Other T15 anti-PC MAb derived from mice not immunized with filarial antigen showed similar patterns of reactivity with circulating filarial antigen.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the first analysis of the expressed B cell repertoire specific for a bacterium. In this study, responses to an acetone-killed and dried preparation of Salmonella typhimurium strain TML (AKD-TML) are described. The results show that AKD-TML can stimulate splenic B cells from primed CBA/Ca mice over a wide dose range. The average frequency of secondary TML-specific B cells is 16.4 per 10(5) splenic B cells. This frequency is similar to that observed for another complex, natural antigen, the hemagglutinin of influenza virus. The majority of all secondary TML-specific B cells (greater than 70%) secrete immunoglobulin M, but most of these clones also secrete other isotypes of which immunoglobulins G2 and A are the most prevalent. Analysis of the specificity of secondary TML-specific B cells showed that the vast majority of these B cells were specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule. Moreover, fine specificity analysis demonstrated that approximately two-thirds of these anti-LPS-specific B cell clones are directed against the core polysaccharides or lipid A regions of the LPS molecule, while only about one-third are directed toward the O antigen region. Since anti-S. typhimurium serum antibodies are directed primarily against the O antigens, these studies suggest that the serum levels of antibodies to a given epitope on a bacterial antigen may not be a true reflection of the expressed B cell repertoire when analyzed at the single B cell level. These studies also suggest that the role of antibodies to lipid A molecules in the development of protective immunity to S. typhimurium be reevaluated.\r"

Twenty-four hours after ascending E. coli urinary tract infection, an influx of neutrophils into the urine was observed in C3H/HeN mice (Lpsn,Lpsn); no significant neutrophil influx occurred in C3H/HeJ mice (Lpsd,Lpsd) at this time. A second peak of urinary neutrophil excretion was observed in both strains of mice approximately 6 days post-infection. The first, but not the second peak was inducible by inoculation with formalin-killed E. coli but not by Gram-positive bacteria. This finding suggested that the first peak is triggered by LPS, whereas the second peak emanates from other bacterial components which activate both LPS responder and nonresponder mice. The first peak of the inflammatory response was inversely related to bacterial clearance. C3H/HeJ mice (Lpsd,Lpsd) retained about 2000-fold more E. coli in the kidneys than C3H/HeN mice (Lpsn,Lpsn). The infection persisted despite the late-occurring influx of neutrophils in C3H/HeJ mice. These results suggest that an inflammatory response to LPS is required for the elimination of a local Gram-negative infection.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody to the Jo-1 antigen (histidyl-tRNA synthetase) is found almost exclusively in myositis patients, usually those with adult PM, but has been found in only 30% of that group by immunodiffusion or other techniques thus far reported. We have reexamined the prevalence of antibody to Jo-1 in sera from 130 patients and 82 controls by using the sensitive ELISA technique. The ELISA used affinity-purified, enzymatically active bovine Jo-1 antigen. A wide range of antibody level by ELISA was found among 24 immunodiffusion positive sera. Six myositis and two control sera had apparent specific antibody detectable only by ELISA. Overall, however, the antibody continued to show high myositis specificity with predominance in adult PM (35.8% in that group). Because the antibody inhibits enzymatic activity of the synthetase antigen, we also studied the quantitative inhibitory activity of these sera to compare with the antibody activity as determined by ELISA. Twenty-four immunodiffusion-positive sera, 29 immunodiffusion-negative sera, and 15 normal sera were tested at 1/50 dilution in the reaction mixture. There was background inhibition by all normal sera tested that averaged 30.5%. All but one immunodiffusion negative myositis sera (a high binder by ELISA) inhibited less than 50% of the average with normal serum. Twenty-three of 24 immunodiffusion positive sera inhibited greater than 80% of this normal average; the other inhibited 66%. The serum dilution giving 50% inhibition was highly correlated (R = 0.83) with the ELISA activity. Thus, inhibition of histidyl-tRNA synthetase activity is a relatively accurate measure of Jo-1 antibody. This method should be applicable to measuring antibody to other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.\r"

Two antibodies, H130 (IgM-kappa) and H241 (IgG2a-kappa), bound to normal glomeruli in vitro. This binding was not inhibited by DNAase, but it was, in the case of H130, inhibited by the anti-idiotype anti-H130. Both antibodies also bound to glomerular digests on nitrocellulose. After i.v. injection, however, H241 bound to glomeruli and formed glomerular immune deposits, whereas H130 did not. Similarly, after i.p. injection of H241 hybridomas to normal mice, all mice developed glomerular immune deposits. In contrast, administration of H130 hybridomas, other anti-DNA-producing hybridomas, and other unrelated hybridomas did not lead to glomerular immune deposit formation. We conclude that certain lupus auto-antibodies can form glomerular immune deposits by binding directly to non-DNA antigenic structures that are normally present in extracellular locations within normal glomeruli.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies of known specificity are used to validate the assay, and the results show that antibodies directed at glycoproteins and glycolipids are detected by this technique. The principal glycolipid targets are found in the ganglio and lacto series of glycosphingolipids, and not in the globo series. When the CELISA was used to study sera from type I diabetics, no differences in binding of control and diabetic samples were detected at low dilutions of serum. However, at higher serum dilutions (1/30 to 1/120) binding of IgG antibodies from type I diabetics was greater than that observed with normal sera. Similar reactivity was not detected in these sera when rat hepatocytes were used as targets in the CELISA. Prolonged culture of RIN cells, however, resulted in the loss of reactivity with sera from type I subjects, and is associated with a corresponding decrease in expression of cell surface gangliosides. Accordingly, subclones selected for ganglioside expression were used to compare anti-RIN binding in type I diabetics with that of normal controls and unaffected siblings. The results indicate that some rat islet tumors express antigenic determinants recognized by anti-islet antibodies associated with type I diabetes. Both nonspecific interaction at low serum dilutions and variable expression of cell surface antigens may explain the difficulties encountered when these cells are used for diagnostic purposes. An objective assay such as the CELISA may help to avoid these problems.\r"

Similarly, epidermal cell suspensions from scid mice failed to proliferate in response to Con A, as compared with epidermal cell suspensions from C.B-17 control mice. Transplantation of normal bone marrow into scid mice reconstituted morphologically identifiable dendritic Thy-1+ EC in whole mounts, as well as Con A responsiveness of EC suspensions, thus indicating that the deficiency in dendritic Thy-1+ EC in scid mice is at the precursor level. These studies demonstrate that Thy-1+ EC are more closely related to T lymphocytes than to NK cells.\r"

Affinity chromatography and immunoblot methods were used to demonstrate a 200,000 m.w. circulating parasite antigen in sera from infected humans which corresponded to an antigen released by adult W. bancrofti during in vitro culture. Two monoclonal antibodies were produced to this antigen by immunizing mice with antigens from Dirofilaria immitis, a filarial parasite that is closely related to W. bancrofti, and screening cell fusion supernatants by enzyme immunoassay and counterimmunoelectrophoresis inhibition. The antibodies bound to a single repeated epitope (not phosphorylcholine) that was resistant to heat, acid, and protease treatments but sensitive to periodate oxidation. Immunoperoxidase studies showed that the epitope was concentrated in the cuticle and reproductive organs in D. immitis, and it was released in relatively large amounts by adult female D. immitis in vitro. The epitope is also present in antigens of other species of filarial and nonfilarial nematodes, but on the basis of preliminary studies, its presence in human serum appears to be specific for W. bancrofti infection.\r"

The IF reactions of the pemphigus antibodies of PV could be distinguished from those of PF or BPF by differences in their reactivity on ME and GPE sections in 98% of the cases examined in this study. In most cases, the pemphigus antibodies of PV cases gave higher titers and stronger IF staining reactions on ME sections, while those of PF and BPF cases gave stronger reactions on GPE sections. In addition, most (13 of 21) PV sera react with the lowest 3-4 cell layers of ME sections, while most (13 of 15) PF sera failed to do so but did react with the upper layers of the sections. Importantly, in 8 of the 50 cases examined by IF, the choice of substrate affected the detectability of the pemphigus antibodies, i.e., 4 of 15 PF and 2 of 14 BPF sera reacted only with GPE and 2 of 21 PV sera reacted only on ME. These research findings point to the need for an evaluation of the combined use of ME and GPE in routine diagnostic studies of pemphigus antibodies.\r"

Specific isolation was achieved by removing contaminating serum IgA by a combination of washes in saline and sodium dodecyl sulfate without a reducing agent present and mechanical isolation of papillary dermis. The tissue IgA was then solubilized by a buffer containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, a reducing agent. Immunoreactive alpha chains were recovered in eluates of DH skin in 6-fold greater amounts than in eluates of normal skin, coincident with disappearance of immunofluorescent-staining granular deposits of IgA. Extracted specific IgA was recovered in sufficient quantity for detection by immunoenzymatic stain, was partially composed of a native (165 Kd) molecular mass, and had alpha and kappa staining material, all indicating that the extracted immunoglobulin was in part intact.\r"

Skin blood flow was estimated by laser Doppler flowmetry and local skin temperature was measured by a thermistor probe. Linear regression of SBF on skin temperature revealed significant correlations (r = 0.87, p less than 0.05) within subjects and large variations in estimated slopes (s/m = 34%) between subjects. Therefore, SBF was normalized to the room climate value in each separate experiment. When skin temperature and normalized SBF from all subjects were included in the regression analysis, a nearly linear relationship was confirmed (r = 0.88, p less than 0.0005). Radiative cooling (17 degrees C) doubled the heat loss, reduced skin temperature by 3.7 degrees C, and left SBF virtually unchanged compared with room climate values. When convective cooling (19 degrees C) was applied at 2 air current velocities (0.5 and 1.0 ms-1), palm blood flow diminished to 60 and 53%, respectively, of room climate values. Corresponding heat losses with convective cooling decreased to 68 and 70%, respectively, of room climate values. Linear regression of local heat loss on normalized SBF gave a significant correlation coefficient of 0.79 (p less than 0.001).\r"

In order to approach this problem experimentally, we used the \"skin equivalent\" model composed of a native collagen gel populated with cultured fibroblasts and covered by cultured keratinocytes. By using bovine fibroblasts to populate the gel, fetal bovine serum in the culture medium, and human keratinocytes to form the epithelium, we were able to be certain that any human fibronectin produced in the culture was synthesized by the keratinocytes. A monoclonal antibody to fibronectin was found to recognize human but not bovine fibronectin. When the skin equivalent was stained by indirect immunofluorescence with antifibronectin, fibronectin was visible as an intensely staining band at the dermal-epidermal junction. In sections in which the dermis and epidermis had separated, the staining was usually limited to the dermal aspect of the skin equivalent. The results indicate that epithelium can contribute fibronectin to the dermal-epidermal junction and suggest that dermal staining in skin sections may originate from the epidermis. Since the developing skin equivalent has a rapidly growing epithelium and simulates a healing wound, contribution of fibronectin by the epithelium, in addition to that possibly contributed by serum and fibroblasts, may be of importance in wound healing.\r"

  ".W": "Ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) is an autosomal dominant, scaling disorder in which keratohyaline granules and filaggrin are reduced in or absent from the epidermis of affected individuals. Morphologic and biochemical markers of epidermal differentiation were studied in keratinocytes cultured from clinically unaffected skin of patients with IV, from clinically unaffected skin of an obligate gene carrier, and from normal skin of unaffected family members and an adult volunteer. Cultured keratinocytes from affected subjects formed thickened layers of scaly cells that failed to react with monoclonal antibody to filaggrin. In contrast, normal cells contained many large, immunoreactive granules. Electron microscopy confirmed the absence of keratohyaline granules in affected cells and the presence of large keratohyaline granules in normal cells. Immunoblot analysis of keratinocyte extracts from subjects with ichthyosis showed that profilaggrin was absent, but no differences in keratins were detected between affected and control cells. For all parameters, findings in cells of the clinically unaffected obligate gene carrier were intermediate between those from affected patients and controls. We conclude that keratinocytes cultured from patients with IV maintain structural and biochemical phenotypic characteristics of the disease in vitro.\r"

During a seven-week period, five very low birth weight infants (index cases [ICs]) more than four weeks of age became bacteremic. Bacteriologic surveillance of neonates revealed persistent colonization in three ICs and identified three asymptomatic carriers (ACs). All ICs and one AC acquired Ib/c-GBS nosocomially, whereas the other two ACs were colonized at birth. Among nursery personnel, 39% carried GBS, but only two harbored Ib/c-GBS. Although phage typing of Ib/c-GBS isolates identified two patterns of susceptibility, we believe a single strain was involved in the epidemic, because the patterns overlapped and most isolates carried the same lysogenic phage. Analysis of events suggested infant-to-infant spread via the hands of personnel, but acquisition from the colonized staff was also possible. The control measures instituted prevented further spread of Ib/c-GBS in the NICU.\r"

Tests specific for each of the enteric adenoviruses, adenovirus type 40 (Ad 40) and type 41 (Ad 41), were designed. The sensitivity of the assay was determined by comparing the results of the EIA with isolation of virus in Graham 293 cells from stools that contained particles having adenovirus morphology. The standard for specificity was analysis of adenovirus genome profiles after digestion with SmaI endonuclease. The sensitivity was 95.8% (23 of 24) for Ad 40 and 97.1% (34 of 35) for Ad 41. The specificity was 95.7% (45 of 47) and 97.2% (35 of 36), respectively. The two type-specific monoclonal antibodies could be mixed in an EIA for identification of enteric adenoviruses in stools without loss of reactivity in either type. The EIA permits rapid diagnosis and type-specific identification of enteric adenoviruses in gastroenteritis.\r"

The estimated attack rates were almost identical in U.S. and Swiss travelers. The attack rate per 100,000 travelers averaged 280 in those who did not use chemoprophylaxis, 162 in those who took 4-aminoquinolines (P greater than .05), and 27 in those who used Fansidar for prophylaxis (P less than .001). Non-immune travelers to Kenya have an appreciable risk of acquiring a P. falciparum infection and need to be informed of current guidelines for chemoprophylaxis. The changing drug susceptibility patterns in Africa require continuous evaluation of the efficacy of recommended drug regimens for malaria prophylaxis.\r"

The isolate was resistant to ceftazidime but susceptible to other third-generation cephalosporins. Alterations in outer membrane proteins were implicated in this selective ceftazidime resistance. As ceftazidime susceptibility was regained, the quantity of outer membrane proteins of 37,000 and 39,000 molecular weight increased. Although the isolate possessed a TEM-1 beta-lactamase, this enzyme was not involved in the selective resistance to ceftazidime; it did not disappear on reacquisition of ceftazidime susceptibility and did not hydrolyze the drug. Potassium clavulanate enhanced the activity of ceftazidime against E. coli strain MG/32, but this enhancement was due to a direct effect on outer membrane proteins and not to beta-lactamase inhibition.\r"

Higher doses of penicillin G and ceftriaxone exhibited significantly greater bactericidal activity in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whereas the bactericidal activity of penicillin G plus gentamicin was not significantly different from that of penicillin G. Clearance of GBS from blood was significantly more rapid in animals receiving ceftriaxone. However, differences in death rates were not apparent with any single regimen. These findings suggest that clearance of GBS from blood and CSF can be improved by more potent antimicrobial agents, but further reduction in the death rate may be difficult to achieve by antimicrobial therapy alone.\r"

Vaccinees had serum and local intestinal immune responses to S. sonnei lipopolysaccharide, and the presence of specific serum IgA or IgG antibody before challenge with pathogenic S. sonnei was correlated with protection from illness.

If the nose was still bleeding on presentation, and the bleeding point was visible, successful management could be obtained by cauterising the bleeding point. This is a treatment that could be carried out by either the General Practitioner or the Accident Department. If the nose was actively bleeding, and the bleeding point could not be seen, then even initially successful treatment by the Accident Department was usually found to be ineffective within forty-eight hours.

In the present state of the art, cochlear implantation seems justified in well chosen cases.\r"

Presumably, they do so by examining traces made by laryngeal microtremors which, they claim exist in the voice, are associated with stress, and ultimately are associated with lying. However, most research that seeks to identify the relationships between microtremors and laryngeal function has produced negative results, and data on the ability of voice analyzers to detect stress from speech--or to identify spoken deception--have been negative or \"mixed\" in nature. Since perspectives based on available results leave a number of questions unanswered, a series of experiments has been undertaken. The first was focused on the basic acoustic/temporal correlates of stress in voice (the subject of an earlier report), the second on examination of stress by commercial voice analyzers, and the third on the detection of relatively high-risk lies by this same type of voice analysis procedure. It was found that correct stress/nonstress identifications occurred only at chance levels; the lie/nonlie identification scores were quite similar with professional \"examiners\" performing at about the same level of accuracy as other auditors. The following review is divided into two parts: a history of the controversy and a presentation of the two cited experiments.\r"

Extraordinary stressors are like more ordinary stressful events with respect to their complex differential effects upon individuals. Personal characteristics and the nature of the social environment modify the likelihood and form of the response of individuals to all types of stressors.\r"

  ".W": "This clinical trial (DT7995) was designed to evaluate amsacrine (AMSA) plus cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), vincristine, and prednisone (OAP) therapy in previously untreated patients with adult acute leukemia and to investigate a new strategy for assignment of patients to treatment using estimated probabilities of complete remission (PPR) based on six prognostic factors. In the first stage of the trial, patients with unfavorable prognosis (PPR less than .40) received AMSA-OAP for remission induction and patients with favorable prognosis (PPR greater than or equal to .40) received Adriamycin [Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH] plus OAP (Ad-OAP). As AMSA-OAP was found to be promising in patients with unfavorable prognosis, it was administered to relatively more favorable patients (PPR less than .60) in the second stage of the trial and to all patients in the third stage. There were 242 patients entered into study; 134 received AMSA-OAP and 108 received Ad-OAP. Outcomes were compared with 242 paired patients who received Ad-OAP therapy from 1973 to 1977. The estimated complete remission rate in previously untreated adults with acute leukemia is 61% for patients receiving Ad-OAP (95% confidence interval, 59% to 64%). Overall, the survival experience for the 242 patients on DT7995 was significantly better than that in the control series (P = .03), but there was no strong statistical evidence (P = .10) that the 134 patients receiving AMSA-OAP had better survival than control patients receiving Ad-OAP, with a median of 32 v 21 weeks, respectively. It is concluded that AMSA-OAP is equivalent to Ad-OAP in the induction of complete remissions (estimated complete remission rate, 61%) and that assignment of patients to treatment based on predicted prognosis is an ethical and efficient strategy for the evaluation of new therapies in previously untreated patients with acute leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Employment of postoperative brain irradiation in the initial management of high-grade malignant glial tumors has now become standard. The addition of conventional chemotherapy to irradiation has not significantly improved median survival beyond 1 year. We treated 25 consecutive patients (13 pilot patients and 12 protocol patients) with histologically confirmed unresectable grade 3 or 4 malignant gliomas with high-dose BCNU (carmustine) followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation and whole brain irradiation. Within 3 weeks of initial surgery, each patient had autologous bone marrow stored (median 2 X 10(8) nucleated cells/kg), and then received BCNU 1,050 mg/m2 intravenously (IV). Peripheral granulocytes recovered (greater than 500/microL) at a median of 19 days (range, 10 to 37 days), and platelets recovered (greater than 20,000/microL) at a median of 18 days (range, 13 to 40 days), following bone marrow infusion. Patients received 60 Gy whole brain irradiation when granulocytes were greater than 1,500/microL. Toxicity was well tolerated. Nausea occurred in 19 patients (76%); however, only eight patients (32%) experienced vomiting (mild in three, moderate in five). Eleven patients (44%) did not require empiric antibiotics, six of whom never developed an absolute granulocyte count less than 500/microL. Three patients with a poor performance status died early (one seizure with vomiting and asphyxiation; one, klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) with bacteremia; one, candidal pneumonia), and one additional patient who was performing well died of pulmonary hemorrhage. The 13 pilot patients have now been followed for a median of 23 months, with a significant survival advantage compared with the 52 consecutive historical control patients who received similar surgery and radiotherapy without high-dose BCNU (P = .037). The overall study group of 25 patients also has a significant survival advantage when compared with the same historical control group, with a projected median survival of 26 months (P = .007). This new approach using early postoperative intensive therapy consisting of high-dose BCNU, autologous bone marrow transplantation, and whole brain irradiation appears to significantly improve survival.\r"

The study group comprised 846 patients treated between October, 1979, and June, 1984. Antibiotics, including cefazolin and gentamicin, were administered only in the immediate preoperative and intraoperative periods. Sixteen patients, none of whom developed infections, were excluded from final statistical analysis because they had inadvertently been entered into the study while failing to meet entry criteria. Fifteen wound infections (3.64%) developed in the group of 412 patients who did not receive antibiotics, whereas only four infections (0.96%) were identified among the 418 patients who received antibiotics. The difference is statistically significant (p = 0.008) and represents a 74% reduction in infection rate with antibiotics. An analysis of subgroups of surgical procedures revealed a dramatic decrease in craniotomy infections from 6.77% to 0% (p = 0.003). Of the four infections that occurred among the antibiotic-treated patients, three were in cases where foreign bodies had been implanted. No complications of antibiotic usage were identified. The rates of infection in areas of the body other than the surgical wound were no different in the antibiotic-treated and nontreated groups. All wound infections in both antibiotic-treated and nontreated patients involved similar types of Gram-positive organisms, suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis did not produce infections with resistant or unusual organisms. This study, combined with other recently published analyses, suggests that routine perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis can significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative neurosurgical infections.\r"

To prevent symptomatic vasospasm, the patients were given the calcium channel blocker, nimodipine, intravenously (2 mg/hr) for 14 days and orally (60 mg four times daily) for another 7 days. At short intervals (at least every 3rd day) the blood flow velocity in the different segments of the circle of Willis was measured with a noninvasive transcranial Doppler ultrasonography method. Within the first 72 hours after SAH, the velocity was normal in the large branches of the circle of Willis and angiography revealed no signs of vasospasm. The Doppler frequency changes that relate to blood flow accelerated between Days 3 and 10, and maximum blood flow velocities were recorded between Days 11 and 20, with normalization occurring within the following 4 weeks. The changes showed a significant relationship to the source of SAH, the side of the operative approach, and the method of nimodipine administration. A comparison between the angiographically proven diameter of spastic arteries and the Doppler-measured blood flow velocity showed an inverse relationship in flow of the middle cerebral artery and the internal carotid artery that was statistically highly significant (p less than 0.001) while this correlation was only slightly significant in the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (p = 0.054). Seven patients (14%) developed delayed ischemic deficits (DID's), which were all functionally reversible. One patient (2%) died as a result of decompensated vasospasm. Based on the information provided by Doppler measurement of the individual blood flow velocity changes due to vasospasm, preventive hypertensive treatment was introduced to improve the perfusion pressure while patients were still in an asymptomatic stage. Among the last 40 patients who were treated according to this regimen, reversible DID's were observed in only three patients (7.5%) and postoperative angiography to detect vasospasm was not necessary.\r"
