  ".W": "Hypertension and cardiomyopathy are prominent findings in humans and rats harboring pheochromocytomas, tumors that can secrete enormous quantities of catecholamines. We have previously found that alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists may ameliorate the hypertension and cardiomyopathy found in New England Deaconess Hospital rats implanted with pheochromocytoma. The present studies were designed to determine the possible action of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on these changes in rats harboring pheochromocytomas. Rats were implanted with transplantable pheochromocytomas and treated with captopril dissolved in the drinking water (1 mg/ml) for 4-6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was monitored by using the tail-cuff technique. In the rats with pheochromocytoma, blood pressure progressively increased to 184 +/- 3 mm Hg after the tumor was implanted. However, in rats with pheochromocytoma treated with captopril in the drinking water before the development of hypertension, blood pressure did not increase (137 +/- 3 mm Hg). In rats with pheochromocytoma with established hypertension, captopril normalized the systolic blood pressure. Plasma norepinephrine was markedly elevated to a similar extent in both groups compared with unimplanted control rats. Plasma renin activities were slightly lower in rats with pheochromocytoma compared with unimplanted control rats. Treatment with captopril of rats with pheochromocytoma did not modify contraction of isolated rings of thoracic aorta exposed in vitro to either phenylephrine or angiotensin II. Treatment with captopril markedly attenuated the cardiomyopathy induced by pheochromocytoma. These results demonstrate that captopril prevents the development of hypertension despite markedly elevated concentrations of catecholamines. In addition, captopril attenuates catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in pheochromocytoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although the precise function of the chromogranins remains elusive, knowledge of their structure, distribution, and potential intracellular and extracellular roles, especially that of chromogranin A, has greatly expanded during recent years. Chromogranin A is coreleased with catecholamines by exocytosis from vesicles in the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerve endings. Thus, measurement of its circulating concentration by radioimmunoassay may be a useful probe of exocytotic sympathoadrenal activity in humans, under both physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we explore the storage, structure, and function of chromogranin A, and parameters that influence its circulating levels. We have also measured plasma chromogranin A concentrations in different groups of patients with hypertension, including those with pheochromocytoma.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability largely account for interindividual differences in the response to antihypertensive drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The factors determining the response to enalapril have been investigated in a placebo-controlled study in essential hypertension. The effects of placebo, the initial dose of enalapril, and long-term (1 and 6 weeks) treatment with enalapril were studied in 13 subjects. By using an integrated kinetic-dynamic model that incorporates a parameter for saturable protein binding, individual responses for blood pressure reduction and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition were characterized in terms of the maximum effect (Emax) and the drug concentration required to produce 50% of Emax (Ce50). In individual subjects, plasma enalaprilat concentrations could be correlated with falls in blood pressure and changes in plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity. For the group, Emax was -46.1 +/- 16.5 and -19.7 +/- 3.8 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, and the corresponding Ce50 values were 66.1 +/- 20.2 and 61.6 +/- 22.5 ng/ml. For angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, Emax (%) and Ce50 (ng/ml) were, respectively, 102.4 +/- 5 and 19.8 +/- 13 after the first dose, 103 +/- 5 and 33.4 +/- 20.3 after 1 week, and 101.3 +/- 2.2 and 31.3 +/- 18.9 after 6 weeks. There was no relation between the responsiveness to enalapril (Emax or Ce50) and patient age or plasma renin activity, but there was a significant positive correlation between Emax and the pretreatment blood pressure. In individual subjects, Emax (first dose) was directly correlated with Emax after 1 and 6 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90152839\r", 
  ".W": "Recent reports suggest that centrally induced increases in sympathetic outflow to the kidney have the potential to enhance the sensitivity of pressure-dependent renin release. In the present study, the possibility was investigated that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which are thought to have increased tonic sympathetic outflow to the kidney, exhibit enhanced renin release in response to reduced renal perfusion pressure. The increase in plasma renin activity in response to a graded suprarenal aortic constriction was determined in conscious young (6-9 weeks of age) and adult (14-16 weeks of age) SHR and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats. Under conditions of relatively little stress, the renin response to reduced renal perfusion pressure was not enhanced in young or adult SHR when compared with age-matched WKY rats. That is, this regulatory mechanism was not \"reset\" in the hypertensive animals. When challenged with an acute stress (air to the face) both age groups of SHR exhibited a significantly enhanced response. Neither age group of WKY rats was affected by the acute air stress. These data suggest that, under unstressed conditions, pressure-dependent renin release probably does not contribute to the elevation of arterial pressure in the SHR. However, under stressful conditions, the contribution of this system may be significant. Intermittent increases in sympathetic outflow to the kidney that can occur in the SHR in response to daily stresses have the potential to render it more sensitive to spontaneous reductions in perfusion pressure. Occasional exaggerated release of renin could then contribute to the hypertensive process.\r"

In the first 4 weeks, the rise in blood pressure was higher in high NaCl than in high NaCl/high potassium or regular diet groups. However, by 8 and 12 weeks, the blood pressure in all three groups was similar. After 4 weeks of diet, plasma renin activity was similar in the three groups (3.4 +/- 0.8, 4.1 +/- 0.9, and 5.2 +/- 1.6 ng/ml/hr, in high NaCl, high NaCl/high potassium, and regular diet groups, respectively) and were not related to sodium excretion. After 8 weeks, plasma renin activity was significantly increased only in the high NaCl group (13.7 +/- 3.7 ng/ml/hr), and by 12 weeks plasma renin activity was significantly higher in the high NaCl group (25.3 +/- 3.6 ng/ml/hr) than in the high NaCl/high potassium (11.1 +/- 2.9 ng/ml/hr) or in the regular diet (7.8 +/- 4.6 ng/ml/hr) groups. Moderate to severe renal vascular lesions were first detected in the high NaCl group by 8 weeks of diet. At 12 weeks, renal vascular damage index (RVDI), estimated histologically, was significantly higher in the high NaCl group (RVDI = 79 +/- 14) than in the high NaCl/high potassium (RVDI = 40 +/- 11) and regular diet (RVDI = 7.8 +/- 4.6) groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Total aortic surface involvement by lesions was reduced from 48 +/- 3.6% in control Watanabe rabbits to 30 +/- 3.9% with captopril treatment (p less than 0.01). Most of the decrease could be accounted for by a marked reduction in atherosclerosis of descending thoracic aortas from 49 +/- 5.2% to 15 +/- 3.9% in control and captopril-related groups, respectively (p less than 0.001). Significant decrease in cholesterol content of descending thoracic aorta was also observed in captopril-treated rabbits. Microscopic examination of the arterial lesions in captopril-treated animals suggested a relative decrease in cellularity and increase in extracellular matrix as compared with untreated animals. These studies indicate that captopril has a potent antiatherosclerotic action in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbit.\r"

Though often referred to as vasospasm, arteriographic stenosis may result from edema of the vessel wall, arterial dissection, the effects of puerperium or arteritis. A biphasic course of spasm, similar to the pattern noted with subarachnoid hemorrhage, has been recorded in some migraineurs. The current neurogenic and biochemical concepts of \"spasm\" developed for subarachnoid hemorrhage are reviewed. Arterial narrowing may be important in several phenomena associated with migraine. It may account for migrainous cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Vasoconstriction has also been invoked to explain the aura and other features of migraine. But the site of stenosis does not always correlate with the headache or focal neurologic features in location or timing. The angiographic changes are probably an epiphenomena rather than a primary mechanism of migraine. These changes may result from altered sympathetic neuronal activity; factors supporting that concept are reviewed.\r"

  ".U": "90153237\r", 
  ".W": "These studies of cluster headache (CH) focus on two key features of pain transmission: a) sensory nerves when stimulated, as well as the expected afferent transmission, also display an efferent function which affects capillaries, glands, and smooth muscle (of the iris in CH); substance P (SP) and allied transmitters such as Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) are the main agonists of this dual afferent-efferent function; b) impaired pain transmission (deafferentation-like condition) provokes a rostral spread of neuronal irritability and automatic firing (\"quasi epileptic foci\") producing a clinical predilection for pain with the generation of \"spontaneous\" pains along the sensory pathways. The substrates studied in the present experiments are the iris, salivary glands, and nasal mucosa. 1) Iris: the conjunctival instillation of SP induces isocoric miosis both in CH sufferers and in normals, thus excluding gross SP receptoral dysfunction of the iris muscle in CH. Electrical stimulation of extraocular (infratrochlear) endings of the first branch of the trigeminal nerve provokes a miosis, which is significantly less in the symptomatic eye than in the contralateral one. This miosis is ascribed to a retrograde release of SP, induced by electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ophthalmic branch. The relatively poor miosis in the painful eye could correlate with a deficient release of SP from the sensory terminals in the iris. 2) Salivary glands: an increase of substance P-like immunoreactivity is found in the saliva taken from the asymptomatic side, but not from the painful side during a cluster headache attack, thus showing at this level also an asymmetry as previously shown in other head structures. 3) Nasal mucosa: intranasal application of capsaicin, a powerful releaser of SP from sensory terminals, evokes an immediate burning pain in the ipsilateral nasal, ocular, and temporal areas, as well as lacrimation and rhinorrhea. A gradual decrease (tachyphylaxis) of these phenomena is consistently observed after few days of daily nasal administration of capsaicin. When this treatment is applied to CH patients, a rapid decrease in the number and intensity of attacks, and even disappearance of symptoms accompanies the decline of the capsaicin-induced manifestations. Local (nasal) capsaicin, in spite of evoking immediately the same vegetative (rhinorrhea, lacrimation, conjunctival congestion) and in part nociceptive (transient nasal, ocular, temporal burning) phenomena of CH, never has been able to provoke delayed spontaneous-CH like attacks. Such delayed provoked attacks, one of the most pregnant phenomena in CH investigations, are almost constantly evoked by systemic stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All twelve patients had had a total replacement arthroplasty for primary osteoarthrosis. All of the prostheses had been cemented. The aggressive granulomas consisted of well organized connective tissue containing histiocytic-monocytic and fibroblastic reactive zones. The granulomas were highly vascularized, and villous structures were observed at many sites. In contrast, the areas around the loose cemented stems were characterized by dense connective tissue. Immunohistological evaluation revealed that most of the cells in the aggressive granulomatous tissue were multinucleated giant cells and C3bi-receptor and nonspecific esterase-positive monocyte-macrophages. This cytological finding suggests a foreign-body-type reaction, compatible with the rapidly progressive lytic nature of the lesion that was shown radiographically. There was a clear-cut difference between aggressive granulomatosis and the more common lesion accompanying prosthetic loosening--namely, the relative lack of activated fibroblasts in granulomatosis. We suggest that granulomatosis involves an uncoupling of the normal sequence of monocyte-macrophage-mediated clearance of foreign material and tissue debris that is normally followed by fibroblast-mediated synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. We also suggest that aggressive granulomatosis in association with a cemented hip prosthesis is a distinct entity, not only clinically and radiographically, but also histopathologically.\r"

Epidemiologic studies confirm a continued increase in the number of basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and malignant melanomas. Dermatologists, the primary caretakers of the skin, manage skin cancer with various modalities that have been time tested and found reliable, including excision, electrosurgery, cryosurgery, and Mohs micrographic surgery. Extirpative procedures for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are considered with attention to cure, restoration of function, and cosmesis--in that order. The dermatologic management of melanoma is critical because early diagnosis and treatment of thin lesions has been the only effective improvement in melanoma management in the last several decades. Wide excision, with a 1-3-cm margin, of thin stage I melanoma has moved surgical management from the operating room to the outpatient surgical setting. Management of these increasingly common problems, as reviewed here, is principally responsible for the growth of surgical practice as a subspecialty of dermatology.\r"

Growth is tightly controlled under physiologic conditions, and several factors must act in concert to overcome control. Because the result of growth is a much larger orderly structure of complex design, we expect the existence of a genetic blueprint for its construction. Peptide growth factors have recently been isolated from a variety of organs, including the heart. We have provided experimental evidence that the heparin-binding growth factor beta-ECGF shows an increased transcription in growing pig collateral vessels. Because the chain of events probably originates in the ischemic cardiac myocyte, it appears logical to search there for the initiating factor. In addition to local production, growth factors can also be transported into ischemic myocardium by blood-borne cells. Monocytes adhere to altered endothelium in a potentially ischemic region and start to produce growth factors in situ. Platelets are rich sources of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PDECGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), all of which are known angiogenic factors or mitogens.\r"

  ".W": "The endothelium modulates coronary vascular tone by the release of endothelium-derived relaxing or contracting substances. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor has been identified as nitric oxide synthesized in endothelial cells from L-arginine. The endothelium can release other relaxing substances such as prostacyclin and a hyperpolarizing factor. Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide formed by endothelial cells, and is likely to be the physiologic antagonist of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Other putative contracting factors include superoxide anions and products of arachidonic acid metabolism. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor is released spontaneously and in response to flow, platelet-derived products (that is, serotonin, thrombin and adenosine diphosphate) and certain autacoids (that is, acetylcholine, bradykinin, histamine, substance P, vasopressin, alpha-adrenergic agonists). A considerable heterogeneity of responses exists among vessels of different size from different anatomic origin and different species. Hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, hypertension and myocardial ischemia or reperfusion, or both, impair endothelium-dependent relaxation. Under normal conditions, endothelium-derived relaxing factor appears to dominate the control of vascular tone of large and small coronary vessels, whereas in disease states, endothelium-derived contracting factors are released. Impairments of endothelial function may be important in the development of various forms of cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".U": "90154499\r", 
  ".W": "Cardiac hypertrophy is often characterized by abnormalities in myocardial perfusion, including decreased coronary reserve, increased minimal coronary vascular resistance, underperfusion of the subendomyocardium during conditions of high oxygen demand and increased risk of infarction in the presence of coronary occlusion. Two major anatomic variables may cause these perfusion deficits. First, the coronary resistance vessels may not grow in proportion to the magnitude of the cardiac enlargement. Second, the luminal diameter of resistance vessels may become reduced as a consequence of medial hypertrophy, hyperplasia or fibrosis. A luminal narrowing coupled with a lack or inadequate numeric proliferation of resistance vessels can markedly limit maximal myocardial perfusion. However, not all models of cardiac hypertrophy are characterized by perfusion abnormalities. A substantial growth of arterioles and capillaries has been documented in exercise- and thyroxine-induced left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, at least in some models, angiogenesis occurs when the duration of the ventricular hypertrophy is sufficient. The hypothesis that coronary angiogenesis is stimulated by increased blood flow or prolongation of diastole appears to have support from a number of experimental studies. However, the cascade of events underlying angiogenesis and the numerous variables that characterize the various models of hypertrophy are complex and require elucidation.\r"

A nonhistologic marker of immune activation would be clinically useful in identifying cases of immune-mediated myocarditis. A viral etiology with subsequent autoimmunity to cardiac antigens has been implicated in human myocarditis. Because autoimmunity and viral disease are commonly associated with increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on targeted tissue, we examined endomyocardial biopsy samples from patients with active myocarditis for abnormal levels of MHC antigen expression. Thirteen patients with active myocarditis and eight control patients with other well-defined cardiac diagnoses (coronary disease, amyloidosis or neoplasm) were studied. A sensitive radioimmunoassay was developed that utilized monoclonal antibodies to human MHC class I and class II antigens in order to quantitate the expression of both of these antigens within each biopsy. Abnormal MHC class I and class II antigen expression was present in 11 of 13 myocarditis specimens and 1 of 8 control samples (specificity 88%, sensitivity 84.6%). Active myocarditis samples had approximately a 10-fold increase in MHC class I and class II expression. Immunoperoxidase staining localized abnormal MHC expression primarily within microvascular endothelium and along myocyte surfaces (11 of 13). This study is the first to demonstrate a marked increase in major histocompatibility complex antigen expression within the myocardium of patients with active myocarditis. The identification of abnormal histocompatibility antigen expression within an endomyocardial biopsy may prove a useful adjunct to the histologic diagnosis of myocarditis.\r"

All patients received the same standardized extract of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus with the same maintenance dose.

In a third group (479 patients), the same pretreatment was associated with preventive measures and with FEV1 results and the occurrence of large local reactions. A fourth group consisted of 223 patients who received a step protocol with the same pretreatment and preventive measures. The incidence of SRs per patient was 36.2% with RIT alone, 16.2% when the pretreatment was added, and 7.2% when pretreatment and preventive measures were used.

The identical studies were repeated after an 8-week course of 3.5 gm/day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Ryegrass antigen evoked mean rises in nasal blood flow of 30% to 100% after 10 and 30 minutes that were significant, relative to prechallenge levels and to levels after diluent challenge, both before and after EPA. Antigen-induced increases in nasal blood flow were significantly less after than before EPA at 10 minutes, and at 180 minutes increases were significant only before EPA. In ryegrass-allergic patients with rhinitis who did not take EPA between the two studies, the increases in blood flow after antigen challenge were the same on both occasions. Similarly, the nasal eosinophilia elicited by antigen was significant at 180 minutes only before EPA. Both a composite index of signs and symptoms and the constituent variables, reflecting the clinical response to antigen challenge, were unaffected by EPA. The suppression by EPA of responses of nasal blood flow and nasal eosinophils to antigen challenge supports a role for fatty acid and phospholipid mediators in allergic rhinitis, but the clinical assessment did not provide evidence for any symptomatic benefit from EPA.\r"

Evening PEFR, FEV1, and asthma symptom scores also improved significantly, demonstrating no significant difference between groups. The incidence of side effects was also similar between groups. We conclude that both enprofylline and theophylline offer useful bronchodilatation in the maintenance therapy of asthma, enprofylline, 450 mg b.i.d., being approximately equivalent to theophylline, 300 or 450 mg b.i.d.\r"

Synthetic salmon calcitonin was administered as a 415 pmol i.v. bolus injection followed by a 90-min infusion to reach an overall dose of 62.25 pmol/kg body mass. Gastric emptying of a radiolabeled meal was surveyed by means of a gamma camera. A pronounced inhibition of gastric emptying with calcitonin was observed in all subjects (median gastric half emptying time 60.3 min after placebo versus 197.6 min after calcitonin; p less than 0.001). Calcitonin did not effect the postprandial gastrin release, nor did it change significantly the serum calcium or phosphorus concentrations. A decreased postprandial insulin release by calcitonin (mean +/- SEM area under the insulin curve 2,124.6 +/- 382.0 min mU L-1 after placebo versus 640.9 +/- 124.0 min mU L-1 after calcitonin; p less than 0.002) was accompanied by a different pattern of serum glucose concentrations during the infusion of the hormone when compared to the situation with a placebo.

Computed tomography, performed in 15 cases, always confirmed the sonographic findings. Lymph node biopsies from two patients showed reactive hyperplasia. Lymphadenopathy occurred more frequently in autoimmune (primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune, and liver-kidney microsomal antibody-positive chronic hepatitis: 33, 25, and 22% of cases, respectively) than nonautoimmune disease (cryptogenic, alcoholic, and hepatitis B virus-related chronic hepatitis: 16, 12, and 10% of cases, respectively) (p less than 0.005). Four of five patients with mixed polyclonal cryoglobulinemia or monoclonal gammopathy had lymphadenopathy. In 125 patients, including 25 with lymphadenopathy, who were monitored for a median period of 25 months, the ultrasonographic pattern remained unchanged. Abdominal, presumably benign, lymphadenopathy may accompany chronic liver disease, especially when prominent immunological features coexist. This should be kept in mind for the correct interpretation of such an ultrasound finding.\r"

  ".W": "A panel of murine mAb against chicken TCR and associated molecules was used to study the ontogeny of T cells. The intrathymic maturation of the TCR-gamma delta, (TCR-1) and TCR-alpha beta (TCR-2) sublineages was the focus of these studies employing immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections and immunofluorescence analysis of cell suspensions. The first CD3+ cells appeared in the thymus on embryonic day 9 (E9) when the CD3 Ag was restricted to the cytoplasm. In tissue sections, both TCR-1+ and TCR-2+ cells were observed on E12, whereas only the TCR-1 cells were identifiable by surface immunofluorescence. On the next day, when a discrete thymic medullary region was first recognizable, the TCR-1 cells were present in both cortex and medulla. Two days later (E15), TCR-1 cells were found in the spleen. Surface TCR-2+ cells did not appear until E14, began to migrate in to the medulla on E17, and appeared in the spleen on E19. The first TCR-1 cells thus move quickly through this maturational pathway, whereas TCR-2 cells undergo a prolonged developmental period in the cortex. While most TCR-1+ cells were CD4-CD8-, a minor subpopulation (5 to 15%) were CD4-CD8+, and less than 1% were CD4+CD8+. In contrast, immature TCR-2+ thymocytes in the cortex were predominantly CD4+CD8+, whereas cells expressing a higher density of the CD3/TCR-2 complex were either CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ and were localized in the thymic medulla. In the medulla of the mature thymus, the TCR-1+ cells preferentially occupy the cortico-medullary junction and form small aggregates around vessels. TCR-2+ cells were less frequent in these areas of TCR-1 accumulation. The thymic ontogeny and, by implication, the selection of the receptor repertoire thus differs substantially for these two TCR isotypes.\r"

Although perforin (hemolytic) activity was detected in unstimulated R8i, it was induced 2- to 14-fold in the presence of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-6, and to a lesser degree (less than 4-fold) by TNF and IFN-gamma. A transient induction was also observed at the mRNA level. Peak perforin protein and mRNA levels were reached within 24 h and started to decline 48 h after stimulation. A trypsinlike SE activity which cleaves the chromogenic substrate N, alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester was also induced 2- to 4-fold in the presence of the various IL tested. At the mRNA level, the message for SE SE1/granzyme A/Hanukah factor was absent from R8i whereas SE2/granzyme B/CTLA-1 increased by greater than 3-fold in the presence of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-6 and occurred with the same kinetics and pattern as perforin. The induction response occurred without any enhancement of cell proliferation, suggesting that the cytokines tested may provide a direct differentiation signal to CTL. The induction response was abrogated effectively by inhibitors of protein (cycloheximide or emetine) and RNA (actinomycin D) syntheses. These findings suggest that the various IL may provide both a growth signal and a differentiation signal to CTL, resulting in the direct activation of perforin and SE genes.\r"

We previously showed that anti-CD28 mAb synergized with anti-CD2 mAb directed against epitopes T11.1 and T11.2, in the activation of purified resting T cells or unseparated thymocytes. Proliferation induced via CD2 plus CD28 was mediated via an IL-2-dependent pathway and was not affected by prior modulation of the CD3-TCR complex. Here, we show that a subset of CD3low thymocytes, although unresponsive to CD3 activation, can be activated to proliferate through the CD2 or the CD28 pathways, in the presence of exogenous IL-2. The mitogenic combination of mAb to CD2 and CD28 induces a proliferation of thymocytes which, in absence of exogenous lymphokines, is restricted to the more mature intrathymic subpopulation, CD1a-. However, CD3low thymocytes can also be triggered through the CD2 plus CD28 activation pathways but require at least addition of exogenous IL-2 to proliferate. This study demonstrates that a fraction of immature CD3low thymocytes possesses functional CD2 and CD28 surface molecules at a time when CD3 is not yet functional.\r"

  ".U": "90154792\r", 
  ".W": "The accumulation of mononuclear cells at sites of chronic inflammation is dependent on a number of factors including localized adherence of lymphocytes to vascular endothelial cells (EC), cytokine-mediated increased adhesiveness of endothelium, chemotactic factors and endothelial permeability. The present study investigates two of the above attributes of lymphocyte-EC interaction: namely, the ability of maturationally distinct subpopulations of human T lymphocytes to adhere to vascular EC and to increase vascular endothelial permeability to macromolecules in an in vitro model. Thus, human T lymphocytes were separated into CD4+ CD8-helper/inducer, CD4- CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor, CD29+ CD45RA- CD45RO+ memory, and CD29- CD45RA+ CD45RO- naive/virgin T subpopulations, were activated with PHA and PMA, and then examined for their adherence to EC and also for their effect on endothelial permeability. Upon activation, cells within each of the above four subpopulations exhibited increased adherence to EC. In contrast, resting CD29+ CD45RA- CD45RO+ memory T lymphocytes exhibited two to three times greater ability to adhere to EC than their CD29- CD45RA+ CD45RO- naive/virgin counterparts. Consistent with their increased adherence to EC, CD29+ CD45RO+ memory T lymphocytes, when activated, significantly increased endothelial permeability to albumin. Although activated CD45RA+ naive T lymphocytes exhibited increased adherence to EC, these cells failed to increase significantly endothelial permeability. Similar to their polyclonal counterparts, Ag-specific CD4+ CD29+ CD45RO+ T cell clones, but not their actively released mediators, also increased endothelial permeability via a noncytolytic mechanism(s). This ability of CD29+ CD45RO+ memory T lymphocytes to augment endothelial permeability may facilitate their transendothelial migration into extravascular space. These observations may provide additional insights into molecular mechanism(s) underlying pathophysiology of localized chronic inflammatory responses in general and more specifically selective accumulation of CD29+/CD45RO+ memory T lymphocytes at sites of chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid synovium.\r"

  ".U": "90154793\r", 
  ".W": "Autoimmunity often precedes the onset of AIDS-related complex or AIDS, and a number of autoantibodies have been described in AIDS patients and persons at risk for AIDS. The presence of such antibodies provokes speculation that autoimmunity is a component of AIDS pathogenesis. We report evidence of an autoantibody (anticollagen) common to all homosexual AIDS patients studied. High titer serum reactivity against collagen was detected in all homosexual AIDS patients, and in HIV+ homosexuals (66%), HIV+ i.v. drug users (38%) HIV- homosexuals (32%), HIV+ transfusion recipients (22%), and HIV+ hemophiliacs (13%), but not in HIV- i.v. drug users, HIV- transfusion recipients, HIV- hemophiliacs, rheumatoid arthritis patients, or controls. Anticollagen reactivity does not correlate with serum IgG levels, so it is not merely a reflection of polyclonal B-cell activation. Titration of anticollagen positive sera typically revealed anticollagen antibody titers 100 times those of normal sera. Affinity purification and immunoblot analysis confirmed the antibody nature of the anticollagen reactivity. The anticollagen antibodies react preferentially with primary determinants of types I and III collagen revealed after heat denaturation. Similar antibodies occur infrequently in rheumatoid arthritis patients, more often on SLE, and frequently in graft vs host disease and lepromatous leprosy. Levels of anticollagen activity in HIV+ i.v. drug users and transfusion recipients correlate with serum beta 2-microglobulin levels, suggesting that those persons with anticollagen antibodies are at greater risk of developing AIDS. This correlation, the fact that anticollagen antibodies occurred in all homosexual AIDS patients tested, and the occurrence of antibodies against denatured collagen in immune disorders with features similar to AIDS suggest these antibodies may be related to disease progression. The association of anticollagen autoantibodies with AIDS and certain other infections and immune disorders may reflect common immunopathogenic features in the etiology of these disorders.\r"

  ".U": "90154799\r", 
  ".W": "S-Antigen (S-Ag) is a well characterized 45,000 m.w. photoreceptor cell protein. When injected into susceptible animal species, including primates, it induces an experimental autoimmune uveitis, a predominantly T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the retina and uveal tract of the eye, and of the pineal gland. In this study we found an amino acid sequence homology between a uveitopathogenic site of S-Ag, several viral proteins and one additional nonviral protein. An experimental autoimmune uveitis and pinealitis was induced in Lewis rats with these different synthetic peptides, corresponding to the amino sequence of hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase, gag-pol polyprotein of Baboon endogenous virus and gag-pol polyprotein of AKV murine leukemia virus and potato proteinase inhibitor IIa, which contain three or more consecutive amino acids identical to peptide M in S-Ag. Lymph node cells from rats immunized with either peptide M or the different synthetic peptides showed a significant degree of cross-reaction. Mononuclear cells from monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) immunized with peptide M also showed significant proliferation when incubated with either peptide M or synthetic peptides as measured by in vitro lymphocyte mitogenesis assay using [3H]TdR. Based on our findings we conclude that a viral infection may sensitize the mononuclear cells that can cross-react with self proteins by a mechanism termed molecular mimicry. Tissue injury from the resultant autoantigenic event can take place in the absence of the infectious virus that initiated the immune response.\r"

In this work, we used the whole blood culture to identify the cells expressing IL-6 gene/protein after various stimulation. When the whole blood was incubated with LPS or Con A, much IL-6 activity, measured by the growth promoting assay using a murine IL-6-dependent hybridoma clone, was detected in the plasma as early as 4 h of culture and continued to increase with time, reaching a plateau around 12 h. Immunocytochemical analysis with anti-rIL-6 antiserum revealed that a proportion of mononuclear cells (MNC) contained intracytoplasmic IL-6 in LPS- or Con A-stimulated blood. Northern blot analysis for MNC from the blood stimulated with these stimuli showed that their transcripts for IL-6 peaked at 4 h, then rapidly declined and was undetectable after 24 h of stimulation. In situ hybridization technique with radiolabeled antisense RNA probe for IL-6 demonstrated that a fraction of MNC from LPS- as well as Con A-stimulated blood expressed IL-6 mRNA. With the combined use of in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence by corresponding mAb, it was confirmed that IL-6 mRNA expressing cells in stimulated blood were exclusively monocytes. In the whole blood culture, it was shown that expression of IL-6 mRNA by monocytes was inhibited by dexamethasone, but not by cyclosporin A. These results suggest that monocytes are the major cells expressing IL-6 gene/protein in the circulation after exposure to external stimuli.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine if NAP-1 interacted with other types of blood leukocytes. In addition to its chemotactic activity for neutrophils, NAP-1 induced chemotactic responses by T lymphocytes and basophils. Chemotactic potency (10(-8) M for an optimal response) was the same for all three cell types. However, NAP-1 caused a chemotactic response in excess of random migration of 7% or 16% of basophils (depending on the medium used) and only 9% of T lymphocytes, in contrast to 30% of neutrophils. This agonist was not chemotactic for partially purified normal human eosinophils. The symmetrical histogram obtained by flow cytometry of neutrophils equilibrated at 0 degree C with fluoresceinated NAP-1 indicates that all neutrophils bound the ligand. A dose-response curve plateau, and inhibition of binding of NAP-1-FITC by unlabeled ligand are evidence for saturable binding to receptors, estimated to be 7000 per cell. Our results suggest that, for induction of an acute inflammatory response, the quantitatively significant action of NAP-1 is on neutrophils.\r"

Compared to LPS, dLPS was ineffectual as a stimulus of both PMN adherence and release of secondary granule enzymes, and dLPS inhibited specific LPS-induced adherence. Neither LPS nor dLPS caused release of the primary granule enzymes, myeloperoxidase, and elastase. Unlike LPS, dLPS failed to prime PMN for superoxide release when a second stimulus (FMLP, 10(-6) M was given. The mechanism of the LPS induced increase in PMN adherence was investigated, and we found that LPS significantly increased the amount of the adhesive glycoprotein CD11b on the surface of the PMN. dLPS had no effect on CD11b expression. Our results suggest that enzymatic deacylation of LPS profoundly alters its ability to stimulate PMN and deacylation of LPS by inflammatory cells in vivo might be an important mechanism limiting the toxic effects of LPS.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, we present data on the activation of different neutrophil effector functions by two distinct Fc-gamma receptors, FcRII and FcRIII. We and others have shown previously that IgG-dependent activation of phagocytosis and superoxide generation is mediated via FcRII. IgG-dependent exocytosis of granule proteins was assessed with Staphylococcus aureus Oxford opsonized with human IgG or with IgG-coated latex. Both anti-FcRII mAb and anti-FcRIII-F(ab')2 mAb inhibited this release, whereas the combination of these mAb inhibited this process more strongly than either mAb alone. This indicates that both FcRII and FcRIII are involved in IgG-dependent release of granule proteins. Cross-linking of the receptors by anti-FcR mAb and F(ab')2 fragments of goat-anti-mouse-Ig showed again that both FcRII and FcRIII mediate lysozyme release, whereas cross-linking of a control antigen (CD67) did not. By measuring the release of elastase and lactoferrin, we found that cross-linking of either FcRII or FcRIII induced release of both azurophilic and specific granules. Under these conditions, we did not measure any activation of the respiratory burst. When FcRIII was removed by treatment of neutrophils with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, the lysozyme release induced by cross-linking of FcRIII was lower than the release from control neutrophils, whereas the release induced by cross-linking of FcRII was similar. Therefore, we conclude that IgG-dependent activation of neutrophils follows two distinct pathways: one via transmembrane FcRII, activating both the NADPH oxidase and the release of granule proteins (as was demonstrated previously by us and by others), and the other via phosphatidylinositol-linked FcRIII, activating exocytosis of granule proteins.\r"

  ".W": "T cell-mediated immunity has been shown to play an important role in the host defense to Cryptococcus neoformans. Infections due to C. neoformans are increased in patients with AIDS who are deficient in the CD4+ subset of T lymphocytes. Thus, the effect of CD4+ (L3T4+) lymphocyte depletion on murine host defenses to C. neoformans was studied. The mAb GK 1.5 was administered to mice, and CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion was confirmed by the analysis of T cell subsets in blood, spleen, lymph node, and lung. Evidence of a functional defect was confirmed by demonstrating that the splenocytes of treated mice were unable to proliferate in response to class II incompatible spleen cells. Furthermore, delayed type hypersensitivity to C. neoformans was abrogated by CD4+ lymphocyte depletion. Mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes were inoculated with a virulent strain of C. neoformans by the i.v. or the intratracheal route. After i.v. inoculation of C. neoformans, the survival of mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes was reduced (27.8 +/- 1.8 vs 36.0 +/- 3.1 days, p less than 0.04). After intratracheal inoculation, C. neoformans disseminated from the lung to extrapulmonary organs. Dissemination occurred earlier in mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes compared to mice that received control antibody, and the burden of C. neoformans in extrapulmonary organs was greater in mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes than control mice. Surprisingly, there was no increase in the burden of C. neoformans in the lungs of CD4+ lymphocyte-depleted mice. Survival of mice inoculated with C. neoformans and depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes was reduced compared to control mice and was related to the increased rate of accumulation of organisms in the brains of treated mice. The mean survival of GK 1.5-treated mice was 34.1 +/- 0.9 days compared to control mice with a mean survival of 40.6 +/- 9 days (p less than 0.001). These data suggest that CD4+ lymphocytes play a prominent role in the host defense of infections due to C. neoformans, that CD4+ lymphocytes are required in extrapulmonary organs for optimal clearance of C. neoformans and that CD4+ lymphocytes are critical for survival of mice infected with C. neoformans.\r"

Four M. leprae reactive CD4+ T cell clones, isolated from two healthy individuals vaccinated with killed M. leprae, recognized a determinant initially defined by the peptide (38-50). However, fine mapping of the minimal sequence required for T cell recognition revealed heterogeneity among the T cell clones with regard to the N- and carboxyl-terminal boundaries of the epitopes recognized. MHC restriction analysis showed that the immunogenic peptides were presented to the T cells in an HLA-DR4,Dw4-restricted manner in all cases. The results suggest that a polyclonal T cell response representing different fine specificities is directed toward a possible immunodominant epitope from the M. leprae 18-kDa Ag in individuals carrying this MHC haplotype.\r"

  ".W": "The multiplication of Plasmodium falciparum within RBC is energy-dependent and the glucose consumption of infected RBC is increased more than 50 times over the consumption of normal RBC. High levels of glycolytic enzymes such as fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase (p41) have been detected in infected RBC. Expression of the cloned aldolase gene of P. falciparum in Escherichia coli resulted in an enzymatically active polypeptide with a high sp. act. and the recombinant p41 aldolase was used for enzymatic and immunologic studies reported here. The presence of antibodies against p41 in the sera of human adults partially immune to malaria and immunization experiments in monkeys suggest that p41 is implicated in protective immune response against the parasite. Therefore, we analyzed the capacity of various antisera to inhibit P. falciparum aldolase activity. It was found that anti-p41 antibodies raised in mice, rabbits, and monkeys inhibited very efficiently aldolase activity in vitro up to dilutions higher than 10(-3). In contrast none of the human sera with high levels of anti-p41 antibodies were able to inhibit parasite aldolase activity even at a dilution of 1/2. The inability of human antisera to neutralize parasite aldolase is not related to antibody titers but is probably related to the specificity of the human antibodies. This finding is discussed in relation to homology of structure of P. falciparum and mammalian aldolase and to a possible mechanism of parasite adaptation and survival in its natural host.\r"

  ".U": "90154833\r", 
  ".W": "The class I MHC molecule HLA-B27 bears an unpaired Cys residue at position 67, which is predicted to face the Ag binding pocket, based on the x-ray crystallographic model of HLA-A2. To investigate the potential of this residue in the antigenic structure of HLA-B27, a panel of 11 mutant HLA-B27 genes has been created, each bearing a separate amino acid substitution at position 67. The genes were transfected into mouse L cells and the resulting cells analyzed by cytofluorography with a panel of antibodies reactive with the wild-type B27 molecule. Although previous studies had indicated that all mAb that bound the B27 molecule on human lymphocytes bound comparably to L cells transfected with the wild-type B27 gene in the absence of h beta 2-m (human beta 2-microglobulin), the first of the mutant B27 genes was found to express several mAb epitopes in the presence but not in the absence of a h beta 2-m gene. Therefore, subsequent analysis of the B27 mutant panel was conducted in L cells coexpressing the h beta 2-m gene. Under these circumstances, all of the mutants bound the monomorphic anti-class I HLA mAb W6/32 and B.9.12.1, as well as the broadly polymorphic mAb B.1.23.2. Binding to the mutant transfectants of three anti-B27 mAb that cross-react with HLA-B7, ME1, GS145.2, and GSP5.3, was directly proportional to the size of the substituted amino acid side chain. The binding of another anti-B27 mAb, B27M2, that recognizes a B27 determinant that includes the region of amino acids 77-81, was not affected by the Cys67- greater than Tyr67 substitution. Rabbit antibodies to a synthetic peptide composed of B27 amino acids 61-84 bound to both the wild-type B27 and to the Tyr67 mutant. This binding, but not the binding of ME1 or B27M2, was inhibited by the synthetic peptide. These data are interpreted as suggesting that the large amino acid substitutions at position 67 induce a limited conformational change that disrupts the epitopes of the three anti-B27, B7 mAb, that are themselves at least partially conformational. The potential implications of these findings for the role of HLA-B27 in disease pathogenesis are discussed.\r"

On the basis of a hypertension definition of 140/90 mmHg or of the use of antihypertensive medications, overall sensitivity of self-reported hypertension was 56% for Mexican-Americans, 71% for Cuban-Americans and 72% for Puerto Ricans. Sensitivity was higher among women, among the obese, and among those with access to a regular place for medical care; increased with increasing age; and decreased with education and the time interval since last medical visit. Independent associations for sensitivity were noted for sex, body mass index (BMI), and time interval since last medical visit among Mexican-Americans; and for time interval since last medical visit and for being divorced or separated for Cuban-Americans. Overall positive predictive value reached 49% among Mexican-Americans, 53% among Cuban-Americans, and 39% among Puerto Ricans.

Twelve lead electrocardiograms were routinely obtained at the time of randomization (baseline electrocardiogram) and at 12 and 24 months of follow-up. There was a positive correlation between baseline QTc interval prolongation (but not QT prolongation) and mortality and sudden death that was independent of treatment group. The data for non-sudden death and non-fatal reinfarction exhibit similar trends. We conclude that: (1) QTc prolongation identifies a high risk subset of post myocardial infarction patients. (2) The relative benefit of propranolol is similar in patients with normal and prolonged QTc.\r"

Light microscopic and ultrastructural observation of the spheroids displayed morphological features similar to those of the original tumor tissue in vivo; in this respect they were different from spheroids obtained from permanent cell lines. The spheroids contained preserved vessels, connective tissue, and macrophages, revealing a close resemblance to the conditions in the original tumor. Flow cytometric deoxyribonucleic acid measurements of cells from the tumor spheroids and from biopsy material obtained directly from the operation revealed the same ploidy and the same amount of proliferating cells in the spheroids as in the original tumor. Fluorescence microscopy using bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) incorporation and anti-BUdR monoclonal antibody confirmed the proliferative potential of tumor cells in the spheroids. Diameter measurements showed that the size of the spheroids from two of the tumors increased over time while in three other cases it decreased. Spheroids from the remaining two tumors showed no change in size, even after 80 days in culture. These growth data and the relatively high number of proliferating cells, as measured by flow cytometry, indicate that the degree of cell proliferation and cell loss from the spheroids are closely linked, as is the case for tumors in vivo. The culture system presented provides a valuable alternative to propagation of human tumors in animals.\r"

The rise in blood glucose was higher after the control meal without guar gum than after the guar gum-containing meals, which all gave a similar rise in glucose. In contrast, increased doses of guar gum led to a greater reduction in the postprandial rise in insulin. The postprandial increase in serum hydroxyproline, an amino acid added to all meals, was decreased in a similar manner by all of the guar gum doses. Gastric emptying was measured after the control meal without guar gum and the meal containing 12.5 g of guar gum by monitoring 51Cr, which was added to the meals. Guar gum was found to reduce the variation between individuals, as well as the initial rate of gastric emptying, which correlated with changes in both serum hydroxyproline (rs = 0.93, P less than 0.01) and blood glucose (rs = 0.83, P less than 0.01). The effectiveness of guar gum in reducing postprandial response was lost after heating and homogenization for canning. A threshold in the reduction in rise of glucose or hydroxyproline was reached with the lowest dose (2.5 g) of viscous guar gum; larger doses had no additional effects. The reduced absorption seems to be an effect of a slower gastric emptying rate.\r"

Nine to 11 rats in each group were killed on d 12 postpartum (study d 34) and on d 40 postpartum (study d 62). During lactation, brown fat citrate synthase, beta-hydroxyacylCoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) and lipoprotein lipase activities were significantly lower in the lactating than in the nonlactating dams or virgin controls. Although the nonlactating dams had their pups removed within 24 h after delivery, by d 12 postpartum citrate synthase and HOAD activities were significantly lower than those of nonpregnant controls. By the end of the study there were no differences among the three groups except in the case of HOAD. HOAD activity in the lactation group was significantly lower than in the nonlactation group. White fat cell number in the parametrial depot was significantly increased in the nonlactation groups by d 12 postpartum. In the lactation group, increased white fat cell number in this depot was detectable at d 40 postpartum, when carcass fat stores and fat cells had been repleted. These results demonstrate that both lactating and nonlactating dams undergo cellular hyperplasia, at least in the parametrial depot. This may predispose them to obesity. Also, decreased brown fat metabolism in the nonlactating dams may be contributing to their significantly greater carcass fat content at d 12 postpartum.\r"

The peak plasma glucose level and total incremental glucose were significantly decreased following ingestion of each starch source when acarbose (8 mg/100 g body wt) or BAY-M-1099 (2 mg/100 g body wt) were simultaneously intubated. The effect of both inhibitors was more pronounced in diabetic rats than in nondiabetic rats, and their effect on digestion was in a substrate-specific manner. Potato starch digestion was inhibited 58 +/- 11% by BAY-M-1099, and by acarbose, 38 +/- 9%. Rice starch digestion was inhibited by 65 +/- 2% by acarbose, and by BAY-M-1099, only 30 +/- 9%. Both drugs had a similar inhibitory effect when corn or spaghetti was ingested. BAY-M-1099 appears to be more potent than acarbose on both a weight-per-weight basis and on a molar basis. When corn or rice was used, only 2 mg of BAY-M-1099 was required to achieve a similar inhibitory effect to that of 8 mg of acarbose (9.7 X 10(-3) M) vs. 12.2 X 10(-3) M). Since both drugs blunted to varying degrees the rise in glucose level following starch ingestion, they may be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of diabetic subjects. Simultaneous use of both drugs in therapeutic treatment should be seriously considered.\r"

  ".W": "It has been claimed that vitamin A deficiency increases the severity of malarial infection in rats. We measured parasitemia, mortality, serum retinol, liver retinol, spleen weight, and degree of xerophthalmia in vitamin A-deficient rats (A-), pair-fed control rats (A+PF), and ad libitum-fed control rats (A+AL) infected with Plasmodium berghei, a rodent malarial parasite. In experiments 1 and 2 vitamin A deprivation began at weaning. Parasitemia and mortality among mildly deficient (expt. 1, mean serum retinol 19 micrograms/dl) or acutely deficient rats (expt. 2, mean serum retinol less than 5 micrograms/dl) infected with P. berghei were not significantly different from those of infected A+AL or A+PF rats. Furthermore, when the mildly deficient rats were given a second, larger dose of P. berghei, all demonstrated complete immunity to the parasite. However, when vitamin A was withdrawn midway through pregnancy (expt. 3), the A- rats experienced significantly higher parasitemia and mortality during infection with P. berghei. Malaria caused a significant decrease in the serum retinol but not liver retinol of the A+PF and A+AL rats. Among the acutely deficient rats, xerophthalmia was significantly more prevalent and more severe among those infected with malaria than among those not infected with malaria. Malaria and vitamin A deficiency acted synergistically to increase spleen weight, and this interaction was highly significant. In these experiments, vitamin A deficiency decreased the rats' ability to recover from malaria, but only when the deficiency began early in life, was very severe, and the rats were young when infected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to evaluate the effect of guar gum on the postprandial increase in plasma lipids, insulin and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in white adipose tissue (WAT). Male rats were given ad libitum access to purified diets containing either no fiber or 5% guar gum for 3 wk. The animals were killed at various times after a meal (10% of daily ad libitum intake of their respective diets). Consumption of guar gum resulted in smaller final body weight (-7%, P less than 0.05) and ad libitum food intake (-10%, P less than 0.05). The difference in epididymal WAT weight induced by the concomitant diet was relatively larger (-29%, P less than 0.05) than that of whole body weight. Although no difference was seen in fasting plasma total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between dietary groups, the postprandial increase in these variables was larger in the animals given the fiber-free meal than in those receiving the fiber-supplemented meal (P less than 0.01). Guar also attenuated the postprandial rise in plasma triacylglycerols. The presence of fiber in the meal reduced the postprandial increase in plasma insulin (P less than 0.01). The meal-induced rise in LPL activity of WAT was significantly smaller (P less than 0.02) in the animals fed the diet containing fiber than in those receiving the fiber-free diet. Thus, guar gum altered the activity of LPL in WAT, an effect that may be related to the insulin response to this dietary component.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, present financing of GME by Medicare is linked to payment for inpatient service, and few other payors pay explicitly for education. Human capital theory suggests that hospitals will be unwilling to finance GME unless their expenses are reimbursed. Reform of Medicare should include changes in how residents' time in ambulatory settings is counted, incentives for primary care education, and direction of funds to medical educators (rather than hospital administrators). Other federal initiatives could include changes in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) support of residents and in Title VII grants. Non-federal payors also should contribute to paying for GME. Physician payment reform could help finance primary care GME, and an additional payment for bills submitted by physician-teachers should be considered. Medical educators must share responsibility by assuring that residencies are operated efficiently and that national needs for physicians are not subjugated to local service requirements.\r"

  ".U": "90155606\r", 
  ".W": "These case reports and review focus on three mandibular fractures that occurred through endosseous cylinder implant sites. The first patient, and most likely the second, had osteoporotic changes that affected their already atrophic mandibles. The third patient probably had an area of deficient mineralization or poorly consolidated bone in the region where the fracture developed. These bony conditions increased the potential for fracture. Although the exact mechanism by which such fractures occur is not known, an examination of past research suggests that stress concentration at the mandibular defect prepared for implant placement is a probable explanation. The site of an implant that has not yet osseointegrated acts as a site of tensile stress concentration and ultimately an area of weakness. Consequently, this area of weakness in a mandible with decreased bone density or mineralization is more prone to applied functional forces. Repeated submaximal functional forces in an area of bony weakness, such as an endosseous implant site, may lead to a spontaneous fracture with no associated trauma. With these factors in mind, several extra precautions should be taken when implants are placed in thin or weak mandibles.\r"

We reviewed the currently available reports of HIV-2 infection to assess what is known about the extent of HIV-2 pathogenicity as it compares to HIV-1 pathogenicity. There is evidence that HIV-2 is associated with AIDS. Most of this evidence, however, comes from descriptive case-report type data that do not meet the basic requirements for defining causality. The most significant problems are the lack of control groups and the absence of a documented temporal relationship with HIV-2 infection preceding the development of AIDS. Comparisons of the epidemiology and disease association between HIV-1 and HIV-2 in Africa may suggest relative pathogenic effects. Although certain comparisons between HIV-2 and HIV-1 are difficult to make, we conclude on the basis of existing data that the pathogenic effects and the natural history of HIV-2 are distinct from those of HIV-1.\r"

Fifty HIV-1-seronegative men, 85 HIV-1-seropositive men without constitutional symptoms, and 14 with symptomatic HIV disease underwent MR imaging using a uniform protocol. Scans were rated by neuroradiologists blinded to all clinical details except age. The majority of MR scans were normal in all of the clinical groups and no covert mass lesions or diffuse white matter abnormalities were identified. Focal hyperintensities in the white matter were observed in 24% of the HIV-1 seronegatives, 26% of HIV-1 asymptomatic seropositives (CDC II/III), and 17% of those with ARC/AIDS. No significant associations were noted between the white matter hyperintensities and HIV-1 serostatus, neurological abnormalities, CD4 count, alcohol or drug use, hypertension, or smoking. In one individual classified with early HIV-1 dementia, MR demonstrated several hyperintensities in the deep parietal white matter, but at autopsy no microscopic abnormalities corresponding to the MR findings were identified. Our studies imply that focal white matter hyperintensities identified on MR are not specific for HIV-1 infection and are probably incidental and of no clinical significance.\r"

The clinical syndrome was characterized by fever (all cases), generalized lymphadenopathy (11), arthralgias and myalgias (9), sore throat (9), rash (7), splenomegaly (6), and other less frequent signs and symptoms. All patients had a spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within 5-30 days. Anti-HIV-1 serum antibodies, as measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) at the onset of clinical illness, were negative in every patient. HIV antigen (p24), on the contrary, was detectable in nine cases. Western blot IgM and IgG analysis was serially performed: IgMs were positive in nine cases and IgGs in three. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was low in all patients because CD8+ were remarkably increased and CD4+ slightly reduced. A laterocervical lymph nodes biopsy was performed in four patients. The morphological and immunohistological pattern of the acute HIV-1-related lymphadenopathy did not correspond to any of the typical ones. The envelope virus protein gp120/160 was found in interfollicular and follicular lymphocytes, in endothelial cells, and in interdigitating and dendritic reticulum cells. The p17 and p24 core virus proteins were mainly detected in endothelial, interdigitating, and dendritic reticulum cells, but in only a few lymphocytes. The follow-up suggests a rapid evolution to ARC and AIDS in patients showing an acute symptomatic HIV infection.\r"

Uterine hyperstimulation with abnormal fetal heart rate patterns occurred with 2.9% and 1% of the BSTs and OCTs, respectively. The failure rate for the BST group was 22%. Maternal age and weight, parity and gestational age were not associated with test failure. Only one patient failed more than one BST, but she did not fail every such test. When test time (time from initiation to completion of the test) was compared between the two groups, a significant difference was found when the BST was successful. However, when test time in the total BST group (successful and unsuccessful BSTs followed by an OCT was compared to that in the OCT group, no difference could be found. Though an OCT following an unsuccessful BST took longer to perform than did a primary OCT, the difference was not statistically significant. It appears that BST test failure may relate more to the technique of nipple stimulation used than to intrinsic patient factors.\r"

A significant difference in AF-AFP levels was found in 9/49 (19.4%) of twin pairs of the same sex and 9/19 (47.3%) of twin pairs of opposite sexes (P = .015). Differences in fetal size or gestational age at amniocentesis did not influence the rate of discordant AFP results. ACHE activity was identical in all amniotic fluid samples in twin pairs. In five additional patients, fetal anomalies (three), fetal death or fetal blood in the sample could have affected AFP levels, which were found to be discordant in three of them. Using fetal sex to represent zygosity, the study indicated that discordance in AF-AFP is more common in dizygous twins. The odds ratio for having a discordant AFP result if twins are of different sexes was 4.0. Implications of our data are: (1) in same-sex twins, discordance between sacs is less common, even if only one fetus is affected; (2) the difference in AFP results in twins of the same sex and of different sexes suggests variability in AFP transfer between twin gestational sacs; and (3) ACHE readily diffuses between sacs and cannot be used to determine which twin has an abnormality.\r"

The gel was inserted directly into the cervical canal after the patient had a reactive/negative contraction stress test. The patient was then observed on an external fetal monitor for an hour before going home. A total of 23 patients received PGE2, and 20 received the placebo. Results were analyzed for the following: change in the Bishop score, lag time from dosage to delivery, spontaneous versus induced labor, cesarean section rate, length of labor and neonatal outcome. There were no significant differences between the groups except in the incidence of patients going into labor within 72 hours. The results indicate that, in general, 0.5 mg of intracervical PGE administered at greater than or equal to 41 6/7 weeks without subsequent oxytocin induction of labor did not appear to significantly alter the obstetric outcome.\r"

Cefoxitin prophylaxis significantly reduced morbidity serious enough to require therapeutic antibiotics or to prolong the hospital stay and led to an overall reduction in the anaerobic microbial flora of the endocervix. However, the antibiotic was selective for the overgrowth of enterococci, which were present in nearly half the postoperative cultures of patients who had received the drug. Enterococcal sepsis occurred in one patient, and three other patients had significant bacteriuria and/or urinary tract infections from enterococci. No cefoxitin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, among species normally sensitive to the drug, were isolated from the stool samples after prophylaxis. The risk of enterococcal colonization and superinfection must be weighted against the benefits of reduction of the infection risk when deciding upon routine antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean section.\r"

  ".W": "Data concerning the in vitro lymphocyte response against autologous tumors are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on melanoma. Evidence for such an immune response to tumors has been accumulating over the last 10 years through the work of several groups of investigators. Proliferative and/or cytotoxic responses are detectable in approximately 70% of patients with primary tumors, whereas the in vitro reaction with metastatic lesions is much less frequent. This response is mainly mediated by T lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood, tumor lesions, and lymph nodes, but patients' suppressor cells and factors have been reported to inhibit such response. Clonal analysis revealed a low but consistent frequency of antimelanoma-specific T-cytotoxic and/or proliferating cells even in metastatic melanoma patients; such effectors are major histocompatibility complex restricted and use the T-cell receptor for tumor recognition of unique and, possibly, cross-reacting melanoma-restricted antigens. The chemical and genetic nature of such molecules remains to be defined. After the limited but biologically fundamental clinical responses achieved by adoptive immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killers, T cells appear to lend themselves as crucial new effectors in adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer and, in particular, of melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of blunt cardiac injury in traumatized patients is problematic and the implications of such a diagnosis are not clear. Although cardiac selective creatine kinase (CK-MB) assays and electrocardiograms (EKG) are the most widely available laboratory investigations, they often correlate poorly with diagnoses made on clinical grounds, or by other laboratory methods. We therefore retrospectively studied the Montreal General Hospital experience with 342 consecutive blunt trauma patients admitted to our surgical intensive care/trauma unit. Using clinical criteria, cardiac injury was diagnosed in 44 patients (13%). Twenty-seven of these patients (61%) developed arrythmias or cardiogenic hypotension, half of which required treatment. Heart injuries contributed to six of the 12 deaths in this group. Many of the patients maintained normal CK-MB levels and/or had normal admission EKG's despite the clinical diagnosis of cardiac injury. However, using our criteria for CK-MB positivity, there was a strong correlation between CK-MB elevation and the development of cardiac complications, and very high CK-MB levels (greater than 200 mu/L) were associated with a 100% incidence of such complications. Focusing on patients who developed cardiac complications serious enough to require treatment, we found combined CK-MB/EKG positivity in all cases (100% sensitivity). This method also provided a negative predictive value of 100%. We conclude that although blunt cardiac injury is an important source of morbidity and mortality its 'diagnosis' is not the issue. Rather, it is more important to recognize which of these clinically identified 'high-risk' patients will actually develop cardiac complications. We feel our approach will enable clinicians to do this.\r"

We report a simple technique, the hilar snare, to control such injuries and compare it to the standard technique of hilar occlusion with a vascular clamp. Standardized lacerations were made in the lung in each of six adult dogs. Blood loss from the injured lung was measured before and after placement of the hilar snare and compared to that following hilar occlusion with a Satinsky clamp (occlusive surface, 5.5 cm). The rate of blood loss before control was not significantly different between the two groups. Blood loss from the lacerated lung was significantly less (p less than 0.05) in the Hilar Snare group (9 +/- 4 ml/min) when compared to the Satinsky group (46 +/- 14 ml/min). The snare's flexible nature ensures complete occlusion of the hilar vessels and is a useful adjunctive technique to present methods of controlling severe pulmonary hemorrhage.\r"

Patients with unilateral renal stone(s) with at least 1 diameter between 7 and 25 mm. were eligible for the study. Fifty patients were randomized to a control or stented group. Double-pigtail stents with an attached suture were placed immediately before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in the stented group. Stents were removed by the patients 1 week after lithotripsy. A survey on pain and associated symptoms was completed by patients at 1 and 14 days after treatment. There was no statistical difference in flank or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, temperature or use of analgesics at 1 and 14 days after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in the control and stented groups. All patients in the stented groups complained of side effects attributable to the stent including urinary frequency and urgency, bladder pain, hematuria and flank pain with urination. Of 25 patients with stents 7 (27%) had early removal because of severe irritation, early migration or accidental removal. Among the patients with follow-up x-rays 1 month after treatment 17 of 21 (81%) in the control group and 12 of 19 (63%) in the stented group showed no evidence of remaining stones. The use of double-pigtail stents is not beneficial in patients with a moderate stone burden. Double-pigtail stents are associated with considerable patient discomfort but no decrease in symptomatic ureteral obstruction or final stone eradication rate.\r"

Catheter replacements followed patient-specific patterns, with each reason for replacement being associated significantly with the reason for the prior replacement (p less than 0.001).

There was a poor correlation between angiography and penile branchial index (r equals 0.314) and between angiography and cavernous penile brachial index (r equals 0.637). We also evaluated 15 normal individuals and a wide range of penile brachial index values was found (0.7 to 1.0). Penile brachial index values from normal patients overlapped with those from impotent patients. Penile brachial index values from impotent patients with normal and abnormal arteries (as determined by angiography) overlapped. The fact that penile brachial index measurements are performed in the flaccid state and without direct visualization of the cavernous arteries accounts for some of the variability of the penile brachial index test.\r"

Journal editors viewed themselves primarily as educators. The practice of editorial peer reviewing did not become general until sometime after World War II. Contrary to common assumption, editorial peer review did not grow out of or interact with grant peer review. Editorial peer review procedures did not spread in an orderly way; they were not developed from editorial boards and passed on from journal to journal. Instead, casual referring out of articles on an individual basis may have occurred at any time, beginning in the early to mid-19th century. Institutionalization of the process, however, took place mostly in the 20th century, either to handle new problems in the numbers of articles submitted or to meet the demands for expert authority and objectivity in an increasingly specialized world.\r"

Two categories of indexed US medical journals were examined: group 1 consisted mainly of well-known, clinically oriented journals, while group 2 was composed primarily of interdisciplinary or specialized journals. Data were collected through a series of interviews and questionnaires. All 16 group 1 editors or managing editors were interviewed. Questionnaires were mailed to 124 group 2 editors (69.4% were returned). Results showed that, although some of the practices of editorial peer review are the same, the two groups of journals had distinct editorial peer review practices. Group 1 made less use of editorial peer review than group 2 by relying on the editorial staff at several important decision points.\r"

  ".W": "Publication bias is the tendency on the parts of investigators, reviewers, and editors to submit or accept manuscripts for publication based on the direction or strength of the study findings. Much of what has been learned about publication bias comes from the social sciences, less from the field of medicine. In medicine, three studies have provided direct evidence for this bias. Prevention of publication bias is important both from the scientific perspective (complete dissemination of knowledge) and from the perspective of those who combine results from a number of similar studies (meta-analysis). If treatment decisions are based on the published literature, then the literature must include all available data that is of acceptable quality. Currently, obtaining information regarding all studies undertaken in a given field is difficult, even impossible. Registration of clinical trials, and perhaps other types of studies, is the direction in which the scientific community should move.\r"

(2) Publication bias refers to basing acceptance or rejection of a manuscript on whether it supports the treatment tested. Potentially biased reviewers are of equal concern. (3) Postpublication bias occurs in publishing interpretations, reviews, and meta-analyses of published clinical trials. Bias can be minimized by (1) insisting on high-quality research and thorough literature reviews, (2) eliminating the double standard concerning peer review and informed consent applied to clinical research and practice, (3) publishing legitimate trials regardless of their results, (4) requiring peer reviewers to acknowledge conflicts of interest, (5) replacing ordinary review articles with meta-analyses, and (6) requiring the authors of reviews to acknowledge possible conflicts of interest.\r"

At the University of California San Diego, a faculty committee evaluated 135 publications of Robert Slutsky, MD, and reported to each of the corresponding 30 journals whether each article was valid, questionable, or fraudulent, requesting publication of the criteria and the conclusions. Journals responded slowly to this request; half required additional letters over a 2-year period to elicit a reply. Of the 13 journals that had only valid articles, 5 printed a statement to that effect. Statements concerning 46 of 60 nonvalid articles were eventually published. Journals' inconsistent identification of published statements made it difficult to retrieve them by electronic searching. Only 7 notices covering 15 articles were found by searching under the Medical Subject Heading \"Retraction of Publication\"; scanning the entire bibliography retrieved 18 articles with retraction notations. A poll showed that journals rarely have written procedures for responding to allegations of research misconduct; in our experience, journals were reluctant to accept authorized retractions or corrections when coauthors failed to act.\r"

There was no evidence that small, obscure journals, non-US journals, or non-US authors were disproportionately responsible for these citations. Although, after retraction, US authors accounted for a smaller percentage of citations, they continued to be the single greatest source. Several possible reasons why invalid information continues to be used were identified. These included a dearth of available information on retracted works; inconsistency in retraction format, terminology, and indexing; and an apparent lack of sufficient attention to manuscripts by some authors and editors.\r"

These publications received 200 citations, of which 80 (40.0%) were self-citations by Breuning or his coauthors. Tracked over time, non--self-citations declined sharply in 1986 and later years, coinciding with disclosure of Breuning's fraud. The data indicated that, in this case, researchers effectively shunned work known to be or even suspected of being falsified. Unique citation contexts (101) were examined to see how citing authors used Breuning's work: 33 were negative (disagreed with findings/methods), 10 positive (agreed), and 58 neutral (no valuation). Also, 63 were inconsequential (no influence on the citing author's analysis/conclusion). Thirty-eight were material, but 21 of these led to negative conclusions. These data diminish the apparent impact of Breuning's work suggested by total citations alone.\r"

Urgent relief of myocardial ischemia with coronary reperfusion has had the largest impact in improving the results. Surgical treatment of mechanical and nonmechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction requires prompt decision making and expeditious implementation. Persistent left ventricular dysfunction and cardiogenic shock are the most important factors that influence the overall results.\r"

Leu 1+, Leu 2a+, Leu 3a + 3b+ T lymphocytes, Leu 7+ cells, and IgA-containing plasma cells tended to be distributed more in areas where CEA was localized over the entire surface of the cancer cells or in their surrounding stroma than where CEA was located along the apical surface or within the cytoplasm. Carcinoma cells with the pattern of CEA staining at the former site were previously shown to be less differentiated than those at the latter. There were also CEA-containing phagocytes which were often observed where T cells and IgA plasma cells had aggregated. We speculated that the dedifferentiation of cancer cells might cause the host immune response, especially the cellular immunity, in malignant lesions.\r"

  ".W": "TILs can be isolated and expanded in vitro in the presence of RIL-2. The resulting cells are highly cytotoxic in vitro and in vivo against a variety of tumor targets. Although most of the TILs bear T cell antigens on their cell surface, recent evidence suggests that natural killer (NK) cells may be part of the overall population of infiltrating cells. Based upon this evidence, we have evaluated the effects of Picibanil (OK-432), a well-known inducer of NK cell and T cell cytotoxicity, on TILs. OK-432 was administered intravenously at a dose of 100 micrograms, previously determined to be optimal for NK stimulation, to tumor-bearing animals. Two days later, control and experimental animals had their tumors harvested and processed in order to grow their TILs in vitro in complete medium containing RIL-2 at a final concentration of 1,000 U/ml. The following observations were made: 1) a greater than 300% increase in overall TIL number compared to controls on day 10 of culture returning to normal by day 30; 2) a marked increase in the percent of cells expressing cytotoxic and differentiation antigens in the experimental group compared to controls, such increase seen mostly from day 7 to day 10; 3) a marked increase in the cytotoxic activity of the experimental TILs against an NK-sensitive tumor target, the YAC-1 lymphoma, throughout the period of growth of the TILs (3-4 times controls) and to a lesser extent against an NK-resistant tumor target. These findings may have potential application, in immunotherapeutic trials against human tumors and may help to understand the reasons for the effectiveness of OK-432 in vivo against selected murine tumors.\r"

To examine their effectiveness in vivo, we tested the ability of these human T-cells to inhibit growth of human melanoma xenografts by using a Winn assay. Nude mice receiving specific CTLs (n = 10) demonstrated a dramatic inhibition of tumor growth. All treated mice were tumor-free at day 50 and nine remained tumor-free at day 65, vs. control mice (n = 10) with average tumor volumes of 321 mm3 and 808 mm3, respectively. To control for the possibility that a non-specific response to the human T-cells could inhibit tumor growth, an additional group received allospecific CTLs. There was no inhibition of tumor growth in this group (n = 8), with the average tumor volume of 2,768 mm3 at day 40 vs. 1,882 mm3 in the control group (n = 10). We conclude that these tumor-specific CTLs can inhibit tumor growth in vivo and may prove useful in the adoptive immunotherapy of melanoma.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups, long-term survivors and short-term survivors. In the group with stage I disease, the incidence of the sparse pattern was significantly greater in the infiltrating than in the non-infiltrating areas. In both areas, the incidence of sparse pattern was greater in the short-term than in the long-term survivors.

Currently, the procedure is being performed for patients with pulmonic, mitral, or aortic stenosis. The results vary according to the type of valve and the age of the patient. In patients with pulmonic stenosis, balloon valvuloplasty can be performed safely and the results are excellent. Therefore, at many institutions it is the procedure of choice for the treatment of isolated pulmonic stenosis. In patients with mitral stenosis, the results depend on the morphologic features of the stenotic valve. In patients with highly calcified and fibrotic mitral valve leaflets, the risks of the procedure are increased and the results are suboptimal. In experienced hands, however, balloon valvuloplasty is excellent for patients with a pliable, noncalcified mitral valve or those for whom operation imposes an extremely high risk. The use of balloon valvuloplasty for aortic stenosis has been limited to the frail, elderly patient who either is not a surgical candidate or is at high risk for operation. Although mortality and restenosis rates are high on short-term follow-up, aortic balloon valvuloplasty provides palliation of symptoms in many patients who otherwise would have been unable to undergo any intervention. Long-term follow-up is necessary for determining the ultimate role of balloon valvuloplasty in cardiology.\r"

Direct immunofluorescent techniques and leukocyte monoclonal antibody studies are useful for the diagnosis of selected cases of vasculitis. The clinical and histopathologic data help delineate an approach for further investigation of potentially associated systemic disorders or underlying causes.

Electrocardiography is a useful and relatively inexpensive test for detecting evidence of ischemia in patients with suspected angina. The presence of cardiomegaly on the chest roentgenogram has adverse prognostic implications. Exercise stress testing is important in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and also provides prognostic information. Patients should be classified into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk subsets by noninvasive techniques. Although relatively easy and inexpensive, treadmill exercise stress testing cannot be performed in all patients, and sometimes it will yield equivocal results. In these cases, radionuclide testing (with thallium scintigraphy or radionuclide angiography) can be helpful and also can identify high-risk patients. Some patients will require coronary angiography.\r"

In 101 ultrasound findings were in agreement (sensitivity 84%). 73 patients had a normal ERCP with ultrasound agreement in 70 (specificity 95%). The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound is now such that patients can proceed directly to ERCP for diagnostic confirmation and papillotomy or endoprosthesis insertion where appropriate.\r"

To assess the effects of FDP on the hormonal and metabolic response to exercise, ten trained males (34 +/- 7 yr) underwent 1 h of continuous exercise at 70% VO2max followed by 20 W.min-1 increments to exhaustion. Two hundred fifty mg.kg-1 body weight FDP or placebo was infused in randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. No differences were observed in heart rate, blood pressure, gas exchange data, perceived effort, or glucose, insulin, free fatty acid, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glycerol, and glucagon concentration at rest, during exercise, or upon exhaustion. In contrast to the previously reported bioenergetic effects of FDP under conditions in which glycolysis is impeded (acidosis, hypoxia, and ischemia), FDP did not affect the gas exchange, hormonal, or substrate response to moderately high intensity exercise in healthy normals.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the study was to compare the blood lactate accumulation and other metabolic responses by trained swimmers with varying degrees of controlled frequency breathing (CFB). Fourteen (eight males, six females) trained collegiate swimmers performed peak and submaximal tethered swim tests during which breathing was restricted to one breath every two (BR2), four (BR4), six (BR6) (N = 13), and eight (BR8) (N = 9) strokes. All submaximal swim tests were of 4-min duration, with tethered swim resistance at a constant 80% of peak resistance. Measures included oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), tidal volume (TV), ventilation (VE), estimated alveolar partial pressure of O2 (PAO2) and CO2 (PACO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), stroke rate (SR), heart rate (HR), and change in blood lactates (delta LA). Significant differences were associated with increases in CFB for all variables except HR and delta LA. Although CFB was associated with reduced VE, compensatory adaptations resulted in increases in TV, PACO2, and SR and decreases in PAO2 and RER. VCO2 was greater for BR2 than all others, and VO2 for BR2 was greater than BR8. The results indicate that CFB does not affect blood lactate accumulation but does enhance oxygen extraction. CFB may impede proper stroke mechanics.\r"

Various tests assessing cushioning and frictional properties are currently in use to evaluate sports surfaces with respect to their potential to reduce the number of surface-related injuries. A critical review of the currently used test procedures showed that most of them are not relevant. The main shortcomings are 1) errors in the measured test results by not correcting for inertia terms due to moving test foot or surface sample, 2) use of inadequate material test procedures where the test procedure influences significantly the test result, and 3) use of material test procedures where the used materials or the applied forces are not representative of the actual situation during sport activities. It is suggested that appropriate test batteries should include 1) test procedures that determine the material properties (stress-strain relation and traction coefficients) relevant for the surface-shoe interaction and 2) subject tests that describe the adaptation of the athlete to the surface-shoe-athlete situation.\r"

Recent studies have suggested alternative therapies, including the use of a warm air spray, the use of helicopter downdraft, and pharmacological agents. While evidence exists to support these methods, they have not been shown to reduce fatalities as effectively as ice water immersion. Although several cooling methods may have clinical use, all techniques rely on the prompt recognition of symptoms and immediate action in the field.\r"

The serious challenge to cardiovascular stability presented by exercise hyperthermia and some aspects of regulatory failure was reviewed in the introduction. The intent of this review, to understand how heat stress is translated into heat strain at the cellular level, is not to downplay the seriousness of the systemic condition. If we are successful, this may stimulate further interest on the impact of heat on the cell as a model for other factors which alter membrane integrity and permeability, lead to new experimental paradigms, and improve the diagnosis and treatment of other disorders such as toxic, hypovolemic, or ischemic shock. This review may also stimulate interesting research regarding more subtle threats to homeostasis such as chronic exercise, hypohydration and thirst, ion imbalance, and sleep deprivation. Since the original article on heat stroke pathophysiology was published (39), we have discussed the relationship of this concept to carbohydrate metabolism (40), thirst (41), and the cellular aspects of heat illness treatment (99). This article will attempt to integrate and extend some of those ideas.\r"

Those individuals, among the young active population (athletes, military recruits, laborers), are at risk to contract exertional heat stroke. Low tolerance to heat results from either functional factors, or from congenital or acquired disturbances. In most cases heat intolerance can be foreseen. Cases of dehydration, overweight, low physical fitness, lack of acclimatization, febrile or infectious diseases, and skin disorders should be regarded a priori as predisposing factors for heat intolerance. Special attention should be paid to subjects with previous heat stroke episodes since it might reflect an underlying cause for heat susceptibility. The heat tolerance of these subjects should be tested 8-12 wk postepisode to detect a possible residual injury in the ability to thermoregulate adequately in the heat.\r"

This manuscript reviews previous findings regarding recovery from EH and presents original research involving the heat acclimation ability of 10 prior EH patients (PH) and 5 control subjects. Heat acclimation, by definition, distinguishes heat-intolerant from heat-tolerant prior heatstroke patients. Nine PH exhibited normal heat acclimation adaptations (40.1 degrees C, 7 d, 90 min.d-1), thermoregulation, sweat gland function, whole-body sodium and potassium balance, and blood values at 61 +/- 7 d after EH. One PH (subject A) did not adapt to exercise in the heat, was defined heat intolerant, but subsequently was declared heat tolerant (11.5 months post-EH). Three PH exhibited large, unexpected increases in serum CPK levels, which resolved upon subsequent testing, and were probably related to their detrained state and the exercise which they performed. It was concluded that: 1) sleep loss and generalized fatigue were the most common predisposing factors for PH; 2) recovery from EH was idiosyncratic and may require up to 1 year in severe cases; 3) PH were not hereditarily heat intolerant, prior to EH; 4) no measured variable predicted recovery from EH, or heat acclimation responses; 5) heat intolerance occurs in a small percentage of prior heatstroke patients, and may be transient or persistent.\r"

  ".W": "Exertional heatstroke (EH) occurs when heat production, generated by muscular exercise, exceeds the body's heat dissipation capacities. This illness has been reported among young, active individuals, laborers, and religious pilgrims. Although EH includes a rectal temperature above 39.5 degrees C (depending on the timing of the measurement) and elevation of serum enzymes, altered mental status is the universally accepted sign which distinguishes EH from heat exhaustion. Once EH is suspected, cooling therapy should be initiated immediately and investigation of multiple-system involvement should be undertaken. Delay in diagnosis occurs more commonly in moderate environments, when suspicion of EH is low. Complications of EH include the central nervous, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems, often with renal and hematologic involvement. Treatment at the point of collapse should focus on clearing the airway, measurement of rectal temperature, whole body cooling, intravenous therapy, and prompt evacuation. Hospital treatment should emphasize whole body cooling, control of convulsions, monitoring of acid-base status, cardiac function, and renal function. The incidence of EH has been reduced markedly in Israel, by using the following simple guidelines: rest periods during exercise in heat, medical monitoring of strenuous activities, use of meteorological indices, and evaluation of medical history.\r"

Gains, time constants, and delays may be assigned to the components of the response and its linearity assessed. These techniques also allow the investigator to examine the features of poorly understood and even unexpected response patterns. Recent interest in the analysis of the non-steady state of exercise-in normal subjects and in patients with gas exchange defects-has led to an improved understanding of the sub-threshold dynamics. At work rates above the lactate threshold, the more complex kinetics are to date poorly described, and hence poorly understood, remaining a fertile area for the application of control-systems techniques to exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The rate of increase in oxygen uptake (VO2) at the onset of a step change in work rate can be studied to provide information about the physiological mechanisms that control this process. Several systems must interact to produce the total response. These can be grouped into oxygen transport and oxygen utilization mechanisms. In this paper, the hypothesis that one or the other of these mechanisms limits the adaptation of VO2 to a change in work rate will be examined. In addition to the traditional approach with step changes in work rate, the responses to other work rate forcing functions will be reported. These include ramp, impulse, and pseudorandom binary sequence work rate changes. The evidence that is accumulating from studies involving transitions from different baseline levels of exercise, as well as studies of the effects of hypoxia and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, has led to the conclusion that oxygen transport mechanisms limit the rate of increase in VO2. However, the dynamic response of VO2 in the presence of adequate oxygen is not much different from that of oxygen limited conditions.\r"

A structural model predicts behavior based on a hypothetical physiological structure. An empirical model summarizes observed behavior. A functional model attempts to relate observed behavior to physiological structure. It differs from structural model since it includes only structural aspects that are essential for describing the system response. This model classification provides for the interaction among experimental data, underlying physiological hypotheses and experimental design. In this paper, we illustrate the utility of this modeling process for studying pulmonary gas exchange dynamic control processes during exercise. The modeling process is applied to the problem of estimating breath-by-breath gas exchange data, to the problem of selecting appropriate models for characterizing the response to dynamic work rate inputs, and finally to the problem of design of the dynamic aspects of the work rate input.\r"

The index of vasodilator capacity was the flow response following the release of 10 min of arterial occlusion, the peak reactive hyperemic blood flow response (RHBF). The index of a structural effect of training on the vasculature was the brachial artery diameter (cm) derived by simultaneous measurement of velocity and forearm blood flow (area = flow.forearm volume.velocity-1). Vascular function differed significantly between the groups, with a greater RHBF (paraplegics, 53.8 +/- 3.7; controls, 38.2 +/- 1.5 ml.min-1.100 ml-1; P less than 0.05) and a larger brachial artery diameter at rest (paraplegics, 0.4 +/- 0.01 vs controls, 0.3 +/- 0.02 cm; P less than 0.05) in the paraplegics. We conclude that chronic upper extremity activity leads to an enhanced capability to vasodilate resistance vessels acutely and to a structural dilation of large conductance vessels.\r"

In normal controls and in patients with various neuromuscular diseases other than DMD and Becker's muscular dystrophy (BMD), dystrophin was detected homogeneously on the entire surface membrane of the muscle fibers, whereas it was absent in DMD patients and partially observed in BMD cases. The density of dystrophin was low in BMD and female DMD patients. In mouse skeletal and cardiac muscles, too, dystrophin localized in the muscle surface membrane, and its presence in the brain was also suggested. However, dystrophin was not detected in mdx mice. These data suggest that myofiber necrosis in DMD patients and mdx mice is likely to be the result of plasma membrane instability.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic and acute administration of epinephrine or related sympathomimetic agents are typically prescribed for the treatment of clinical disorders such as hypotension, anaphylactic and allergic reactions, and bronchial asthma. In addition to its effects on these infirmaties and on carbohydrate metabolism, epinephrine also exerts a positive inotropic effect on fast-contracting skeletal muscle in a variety of animal species. At present, the precise mechanisms responsible for the inotropic effect are not known. This communication reviews the positive inotropic effects of epinephrine on fast-contracting skeletal muscle and discusses possible mechanisms which might mediate this phenomenon. Epinephrine potentiates muscle twitches via the second messenger, cAMP, secondary to hormone binding to membrane-bound beta-receptors. Cyclic AMP then acts to increase carbohydrate metabolism, alter sodium/potassium exchange, phosphorylate myosin isozymes, and/or alter intracellular calcium exchange. Based on theoretical grounds, the first three mechanisms can be excluded. Therefore, it is tentatively hypothesized that the effect is due to cAMP-enhanced calcium exchange within the muscle fiber and/or to increased influx of extracellular calcium. This notion is consistent with the mechanism of the positive inotropic effects of epinephrine on cardiac tissue. If this hypothesis is correct, it would also suggest a role, at least under some conditions, for extracellular calcium in the process of skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling.\r"

  ".U": "90158705\r", 
  ".W": "Because glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is selectively impaired during the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), we tested the possibility that the glucose transporter of pancreatic islet beta cells is a target of the autoimmune process in patients with IDDM. We measured the uptake of 3-O-methyl-beta-D-glucose by dispersed islet cells from rats after a 15-minute incubation with purified IgG from 27 patients with newly diagnosed IDDM, 28 normal subjects, and 5 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The IgG fractions from 26 of the 27 patients with IDDM (96 percent), but from none of the 5 patients with NIDDM, reduced the initial rates of 3-O-methyl-beta-D-glucose uptake to at least 1 SD below the mean of the rates observed in the presence of IgG fractions from normal subjects (P less than 0.001). In contrast, the uptake of L-leucine by islet cells was not affected by any of the IgG fractions. The inhibitory activity of IgG from the patients with IDDM was abolished by preincubation with islet cells and membranes from hepatocytes, which contain the same glucose transporter as beta cells, but not with erythrocytes, which do not contain this transporter. We conclude that IgG from patients with IDDM of recent onset, but not from those with NIDDM, inhibits glucose uptake by rat islet cells. The results are consistent with the presence of an antibody against a protein involved in glucose transport by beta cells that would thereby impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and epidemiologic studies suggest that the intake of potassium chloride lowers blood pressure. To investigate whether supplemental potassium chloride (96 mmol of microcrystalline potassium chloride a day) reduced the need for antihypertensive medication in hypertensive men on a restricted-sodium diet, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. A total of 287 men 45 to 68 years of age, 142 given potassium chloride and 145 given placebo, were followed for an average of 2.2 years after the withdrawal of their antihypertensive medication. Men in both groups received instructions on following a low-sodium diet. Overnight urinary sodium excretion fell from 63 mmol per eight hours at base line to an average of 45 mmol per eight hours during follow-up. Participants given supplemental potassium chloride had significantly higher (P less than 0.001) serum potassium levels and urinary potassium excretion (averaging 4.5 mmol per liter and 42.5 mmol per eight hours, respectively) during follow-up than participants given placebo (4.2 mmol per liter and 20.0 mmol per eight hours). Seventy-nine participants in each group required reinstitution of antihypertensive medication according to strict indications defined by the protocol. No significant differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure were observed between the two groups. During follow-up, systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaged 130.6 and 82.5 mm Hg, respectively, for participants given supplemental potassium, and 132.5 and 83.1 mm Hg for participants given placebo. We conclude that supplemental potassium chloride does not reduce the need for antihypertensive medication in hypertensive men on a restricted-sodium diet.\r"

All the children were singletons with cephalic presentation, and all weighed less than or equal to 1750 g at birth. The mental and psychomotor indexes of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (standardized mean score +/- SD, 100 +/- 16) and a formal neurologic examination were administered at three follow-up visits (at 4, 8, and 18 months of age, corrected for gestational age). At 18 months, the mean mental-development scores in the groups receiving electronic fetal monitoring and periodic auscultation were 100.5 +/- 2.4 and 104.9 +/- 1.8, respectively (P greater than 0.1). The mean psychomotor-development scores in the two groups at 18 months were 94.0 +/- 2.4 and 98.3 +/- 1.8, respectively (P greater than 0.1). The incidence of cerebral palsy was higher in the electronically monitored group--20 percent as compared with 8 percent in the group that was monitored by auscultation (P less than 0.03). In the electronic-fetal-monitoring group (but not in the periodic-auscultation group), the risk of cerebral palsy increased with the duration of abnormal fetal-heart-rate patterns, as assessed by retrospective review (chi 2 trend = 12.71, P less than 0.001). The median time to delivery after the diagnosis of abnormal fetal-heart-rate patterns was 104 minutes with electronic fetal monitoring, as compared with 60 minutes with periodic auscultation. We conclude that as compared with a structured program of periodic auscultation, electronic fetal monitoring does not result in improved neurologic development in children born prematurely.\r"

For example, the mouse int-2 gene, which encodes an FGF-related product, is a frequent target of proviral activation in carcinomas induced by mouse mammary tumour virus, but apparently functions at discrete stages of normal embryonic development. Six classes of int-2 messenger RNA have been identified in embryonic cells, each of which is predicted to encode the same 245-amino-acid protein. But all known int-2 transcripts include sequences upstream of the AUG codon presumed to be the initiation codon. Here we report an additional N-terminally extended int-2 gene product initiated at an in-frame CUG codon. In COS-1 cells transiently transfected with appropriate int-2 complementary DNAs, the AUG-initiated product is found predominantly in the secretory pathway, whereas the CUG-initiated form is localized to the nucleus. These data indicate that the Int-2 oncoprotein could influence cellular behaviour by two distinct mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "90158818\r", 
  ".W": "Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) is a defective murine C-type retrovirus which causes a multi-stage erythroleukaemia in mice and erythroblastosis in bone marrow cultures. The SFFV env gene encodes a membrane glycoprotein, gp55, which is located on the cell surface and in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is essential both for the induction of leukaemia in vivo and erythroblast proliferation in vitro. The mechanism by which gp55 causes increased erythroblastosis and ultimately leukaemia is unknown, but a reasonable suggestion is that gp55 can mimic the action of erythropoietin by binding to its receptor (Epo-R), thereby triggering prolonged proliferation of erythroid cells. To test this possibility, we have co-expressed gp55 and the murine Epo-R in a fibroblast cell line. We show here that in such cells, the SFFV glycoprotein binds directly to Epo-R. Furthermore, when an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent lymphoid cell line was co-infected by SFFV and a virus that carries the Epo-R gene, it could grow without IL-3. We suggest that through direct binding to Epo-R, gp55 can stimulate the receptor and by-pass the normal requirement for Epo, causing prolonged proliferation of infected erythroid cells. This could be the first step of leukaemogenesis induced by Friend virus.\r"

  ".U": "90158833\r", 
  ".W": "Despite their widespread occurrence in the central nervous system, interactions between co-localized transmitters and their receptors remain poorly understood. Noradrenergic neurons of the nucleus locus coeruleus contain the peptide co-transmitter neuropeptide Y (refs 1,2). In locus coeruleus cells, stimulation of alpha2-adrenoceptors 3,4 or opioid mu-receptors 5,6 increases a potassium conductance and thereby leads to hyperpolarization and inhibition of spontaneous firing. Coupling between these receptors and the inward rectifying K+ channels involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein (Gi or Go)7. Here we investigate whether the neuropeptide Y and alpha2-receptors of locus coeruleus neurons interact with one another. When administered alone, neuropeptide Y reduces the discharge of action potentials, probably by increasing the permeability of the membrane to potassium ions through the activation of a G protein; this effect is reduced in the presence of alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Moreover, the peptide selectively increases the hyperpolarizing effect of alpha2-agonists, but does not enhance responses to opioid mu-agonists. We suggest that noradrenaline and its co-transmitter neuropeptide Y stimulate separate receptors, which influence each other in a specific way.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that the dystrophin gene, which is defective in patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (reviewed in ref. 1), is transcribed in brain from a specific promoter that is different from the one used in muscle, and so the two types of transcripts differ at least in their first exon. We recently found that the dystrophin gene is expressed at a higher level in primary cultures of neuronal cells than in astro-glial cells derived from adult mouse brain. Here we investigate the use of two different promoters in each cell type. Our results demonstrate that the brain-type promoter of the dystrophin gene is highly specific to neurons, in which there is a significant increase in the amount of brain-specific messenger RNA during the course of in vitro maturation. By contrast, the muscle-type promoter is active in a wider range of cell types, including not only striated and smooth muscle, but also glial cells to a lesser extent, and probably neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Attention has focused on the regulation of the eucaryotic cell division cycle since the protein kinase p34cdc2 was identified as a key enzyme in mitotic induction. The level of this kinase remains constant throughout the cell cycle but its activity alters, particularly before M phase. Although the factors regulating cdc2 activity are still unknown, there is increasing evidence that it is influenced by p34cdc2 dephosphorylation. Protein phosphatase inhibitor-2 (I2) is a specific inhibitor of phosphatase type-1, which with type-2A is one of the two principal Ser(P) and Thr(P) phosphatases. Here we show that the level of I2, assayed by immunofluorescence staining, activity measurements, western immunoblotting and metabolic labelling, oscillates during the cell cycle in rat fibroblasts, peaking at S phase and mitosis. Moreover, when we inhibited I2 in vivo by microinjection of anti-I2 antibodies in S-phase cells, the pseudo-mitotic cellular response to injected p34cdc2 was restored, indicating that I2 might have a role in the modulation of p34cdc2 activity.\r"

  ".U": "90158841\r", 
  ".W": "Ribozymes use specific RNA-RNA interactions for substrate binding and active-site formation. Self-splicing group I introns have approximately 70 nucleotides constituting the core, a region containing sequences and structures indispensable for catalytic function. The catalytic core must interact with the substrates used for the two steps of the self-splicing reaction, that is, guanosine, the 5'-splice-site helix (P1) and the 3' splice site. Mutational evidence suggests that core sequences near segment J6/7 that joins the base-paired stems P6 and P7, and the bulged base of P7(5'), participate in binding guanosine substrate, but nothing is known about the interactions between the core, the 5'-splice-site helix and the 3' splice site. On the basis of comparative sequence data, it has been suggested that two specific bases in the catalytic core of group I introns might form a binding sequence for the 3' splice site. Here we present genetic evidence that such a binding site exists in the core of the Tetrahymena large subunit ribosomal RNA intron. We demonstrate that this pairing, termed P9.0, is functionally important in the exon ligation step of self-splicing, but is not itself responsible for 3'-splice-site selection.\r"

Changes in the control of both water intake and excretion accompany aging and may predispose the elderly to disturbances in sodium and water balance. Reduced thirst and water intake in response to water deprivation and thermal dehydration have been observed in healthy elderly persons. This reduction, combined with reduced renal water-conservation capacity, may predispose the elderly to dangerous dehydration when illness increases water losses or physical incapacity prevents access to water. The reasons for the thirst deficit are not clear. The elderly have a reduced capacity to excrete a water load, which means they are predisposed to water overload and hyponatremia. Furthermore, various neuroendocrine changes in the elderly affect fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. More studies are needed to understand the etiology of the disturbances of fluid intake and output so that they can be better prevented and treated.\r"

Slowing of BPD, head circumference, and abdominal circumference growth was noted in triplets from the 28th week of gestation, whereas the head circumference/abdominal circumference ratio was similar to that of singletons. Femur growth was parallel to that of singletons, although on the low margin of the two standard deviations. We conclude that the growth patterns of triplets are different from those of singletons. We suggest that femur length derived for singletons may be suitable for the follow-up of triplets. However, when growth retardation is suspected, the growth curves presented herein may be used to identify the growth-retarded fetus.\r"

The intervention administered by the nurse-midwives included patient education to identify the signs and symptoms of preterm labor, activity counseling in response to monitoring of the cervix by frequent examinations, stress reduction by enhancing social support, nutrition counseling with emphasis on weight gain, and substance-abuse counseling. For women in the control group, care was provided by obstetricians according to local standards for the management of high-risk pregnancies. We hypothesized that the LBW rate among live births to women who had received care from nurse-midwives would be lower than that in the control group. Although the LBW rate was lower in the intervention group than in the control group, the observed difference was not statistically significant. Race was not prespecified as a possible effect modifier, but examination of the data post hoc suggested that black women at high statistical risk of giving birth to an LBW infant may have derived benefit from the program. Although the results do not suggest any striking advantage of the nurse-midwifery intervention over standard obstetric care for women at high statistical risk of having an LBW infant, neither do they suggest any disadvantage. Nurse-midwives could provide care to certain populations of high-risk women and facilitate future coverage of these presently underserved populations.\r"

The analysis revealed that 1) from 24-29 weeks' gestation, there was no significant difference in the uterine activity between the two groups; and 2) beginning at 30 weeks' gestation and continuing until the end of the 36th week of gestation, uterine activity was significantly greater in women destined to deliver preterm. These observations suggest that the patterns of daily uterine contractility observed in patients after an episode of preterm labor can identify those at greater risk for a preterm delivery.\r"

The outcome variables of interest were Bishop score upon removal of the devices, number of devices used, induction-to-delivery time, and induction-to-complete dilatation time. In the Dilapan group, an average of 4.3 devices per patient was used, compared with 9.7 devices in the laminaria group (P less than .01). Among patients who eventually achieved complete dilatation, the mean (+/- SD) time for the Dilapan group was 10.8 +/- 6.1 hours, compared with 14.7 +/- 9.2 hours with laminaria. For women undergoing induction of labor at term with an unripe cervix, Dilapan appeared to be a preferable alternative to Laminaria japonicum because its use may result in a shorter induction-to-delivery interval with fewer devices required to obtain significant cervical ripening.\r"

Prenatal diagnostic procedures were performed in 96 pregnancies. Two hundred nine couples declined active intervention, and these pregnancies were followed to delivery. Five chromosomal abnormalities (1.6%) were diagnosed in the study group. A group of 979 prenatal diagnostic procedures performed in \"low-risk\" pregnancies in Hutzel Hospital was used as controls, and three chromosomal anomalies (0.3%) were diagnosed. That the rate of aneuploid conceptions was statistically significantly (P = .02) higher in low-risk couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss than in controls points to a tendency for chromosomal aberrations in their offspring and suggests a place for prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies.\r"

In patients with cesarean delivery (N = 124), prophylactic antibiotics (relative risk 0.54; P less than .0002) and high-virulence bacteria or Mycoplasma hominis (relative risk 1.4; P less than .01) predicted the incidence of endometritis, and in patients with vaginal delivery (N = 483), \"bacterial vaginosis organisms\" (relative risk 14.2; P less than .001) and aerobic gram-negative rods (relative risk 4.2; P less than .01) predicted endometritis.

Transvaginal ultrasound offers improved resolution in the imaging of the uterus and adnexa. Seventy-four women with normal intrauterine pregnancies, 18 women with spontaneous abortions, and 34 women with tubal pregnancies were evaluated by transvaginal ultrasound and serial hCG determinations. Intrauterine pregnancies were followed within the first 50 days of gestation. In women with a normal uterus and singleton pregnancy, sacs were consistently recognized in association with an hCG level greater than 2004 mIU/mL (First International Reference Preparation). Two-to three-millimeter sacs were recognized in association with an hCG level of 2032 +/- 1253 on cycle day 36.1 +/- 2.0. When sacs were less than 5 mm in mean diameter, 33% exhibited a prominent echogenic rim, 38% exhibited a partial echogenic rim, and 29% exhibited no echogenic rim. Fetal cardiac activity was recognized in association with an hCG level of 27,284 +/- 11,479 on cycle day 45.0 +/- 2.9. The hCG doubling time was 1.46 +/- 1.0 days. Apparent loss of multiple gestational sacs was observed in five normal pregnancies. Apparent bleeding in the intrauterine cavity was observed in eight patients and associated with a 38% abortion rate. One false-positive sac was observed among 34 tubal pregnancies (3%). The extrauterine sonographic finding of a solid adnexal mass or cul-de-sac fluid was specific but not sensitive for the diagnosis of tubal pregnancy. The hCG doubling time in tubal pregnancies was 7.69 +/- 9.8 days. Transvaginal ultrasound and serial hCG determinations are useful for the early recognition of tubal pregnancy.\r"

By 17 weeks of gestation, the diagnosis was made with certainty. The transvaginal approach has changed the role of first-trimester ultrasound in the diabetic pregnancy. We suggest that transvaginal ultrasonography be used for purposes of accurate dating and for early detection of diabetic embryopathy, particularly in patients with poor periconceptional glycemic control.\r"

  ".W": "Transvaginal sonographic transducers have permitted better resolution of the pelvic structures than previously possible. The presenting fetal part may be difficult to image transabdominally when lodged deep in the lower uterine segment. In particular, second-trimester fetuses associated with severe oligohydramnios present a challenge to the sonologist because of both the lack of amniotic fluid and the deep and curled fetal position in the maternal pelvis. Two cases are reported of second-trimester oligohydramnios in which the fetal abnormalities were visible only with the vaginal probe. The vaginal scan permitted a definitive diagnosis of Potter syndrome not possible with the poorer resolution of the transabdominal approach. I conclude that transvaginal scanning should be considered in patients with unexplained severe oligohydramnios because the resolution of the fetal anatomy is greatly enhanced.\r"

We present a case of an oral cephalocele associated with polyhydramnios discovered on antenatal ultrasound. The differential diagnosis includes epignathus and epulis. The prognosis is dependent not only on the extent of brain involvement and associated anomalies, but also on the exact location of the herniated mass. If the oral cavity is extensively involved, airway management at birth may be difficult. Therefore, preparations for delivery may include maternal tertiary site referral, antenatal neurosurgical and pediatric consultation, and anticipation of complications such as rupture of the sac, dystocia, or the need for immediate tracheostomy if intubation is not possible.\r"

The plasma lithium level during the pregnancy was in or below the therapeutic range. From the 26th week of gestation, polyhydramnios developed. In the 35th week, 11.5 L of amniotic fluid was removed over a period of 12 hours by transabdominal amniocentesis. A cesarean delivery was performed in the 39th week of gestation because of fetal distress. The infant presented with the following symptoms, which in previous reports have been associated with lithium toxicity: asphyxia, apnea, cardiac decompensation, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes insipidus, hypotonia, and convulsions. The polyhydramnios was probably caused by fetal diabetes insipidus, possibly combined with cardiac decompensation. Lithium can be toxic to the infant and the fetus even though the mother is not affected and has a normal or low plasma lithium level. Polyhydramnios may be a sign of fetal lithium toxicity.\r"

The diagnosis of histiocytosis X may be established by identifying the Langerhans histiocyte, characterized by nuclear grooves, immunoreactivity for S-100 protein, and pentalamellar cytoplasmic structures seen by electron microscopy. Prognosis is difficult to determine with certainty. However, age of less than 2 years at presentation, multi-organ involvement, and/or organ dysfunction appear to be associated with a less favorable prognosis.

Complications in women who have undergone such complex procedures may endanger them or their fetuses and can disrupt the reconstruction or impair renal function. To counsel better those patients who have undergone urinary reconstruction and who desire to bear children, and to develop an approach to the management of their pregnancies, we reviewed the available literature. We found that the incidence of complications was low during pregnancy after a genitourinary reconstruction; the majority of women had an uneventful pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Close observation of renal function and prophylaxis against urinary tract infection during pregnancy are recommended. Elective cesarean is advised for women who have had a reconstruction of the bladder neck or urethra or who have received an artificial urinary sphincter. Urologists and gynecologists must continue to report the outcome of pregnancy in their patients who have undergone reconstruction so that we may develop meaningful data about the incidence of complications.\r"

We found 600 cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis published since 1982. These cases were reviewed with particular attention to genetic causes and were compared with a literature review of 298 cases published before 1982. The mean gestational age at diagnosis varied from 24-29 weeks in the recent series, compared with 31-33 weeks in the earlier series. Genetically transmitted conditions accounted for more than 35% of the fetal and maternal disorders associated with nonimmune hydrops fetalis in the recent series, compared with 21% before 1982. The most frequently identified genetic abnormalities in our review were chromosomal disorders (15.7%), alpha-thalassemia (10.3%), skeletal dysplasia (4%), arthrogryposis multiplex syndromes (1.8%), multiple pterygium syndrome (1.5%), and lysosomal storage disorders (1.0%). These results confirm the need for systematic chromosome analysis in fetuses with nonimmune hydrops. From this review, we conclude that prenatal noninvasive and invasive techniques combined with detailed pathologic studies have improved the accuracy of diagnosis of the underlying causes of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and have influenced the management of these pregnancies.\r"

The prevalence and extent of hemorrhage was equal in the two groups on postoperative days 3 and 7. In a clinical trial of 51 eyes undergoing diabetic vitrectomy, 70% of eyes randomized to air-filled vitreous cavity after vitrectomy had vitreous cavity hemorrhage on postoperative day 1 compared with 50% of fluid-filled eyes. At 1 week, the incidence of hemorrhage was 78% for air and 61% for fluid. The 6-month visual and anatomic results were similar in both groups. These findings suggest that an intravitreal air bubble neither improves hemostasis nor reduces the visual outcome after diabetic vitrectomy.\r"

In both a retrospective and a prospective dynamically balanced study, the control rates appeared to be similar. There were more posterior segment complications after 125I plaques and more anterior segment complications, including neovascular glaucoma, after helium ion irradiation. The follow-up period is too short to draw definitive conclusions on the radiation complications. Overall, approximately 89% of eyes were retained and less than 4% of treated eyes were removed because of failure to control the tumor.\r"

Three variations in the fundus appearances were distinguished: in the first and most common, white to yellow fundus spots (which are not drusen) accompany a disciform macular degeneration; in the second, the fundus spots are absent; in the third, the yellow deposits are associated with atrophic macular degeneration. Atrophy of the retina, pigment epithelium, and choroid then slowly progresses toward the periphery. Treatment does not halt the progress of the disease. Although variations in this dystrophy may be examples of genetic heterogeneity, Sorbsy's fundus dystrophy is a distinct clinical disorder.\r"

The results of the literature review show that all of the soft tissue lesions occurred before the age of 30 years (mean age, 8.3 +/- 7.0 years). There was a slight male predilection (male to female, 1.2:1). Most cases occurred in the paramandibular soft tissues and mandibular mucosa. Surface resorption of the underlying bone was a common feature. The recurrence rate was 22% and all of these were controlled with further therapy. The desmoplastic fibromas occurred in a slightly older age group (mean age, 14.7 +/- 12.1 years) although 88% of the patients were still younger than 30 years. There was no sex predilection. The vast majority occurred in the area of the mandibular body-angle-ramus. Radiographically, half were unilocular and half were multilocular. Some had poorly defined radiographic margins. The recurrence rate was 25%. The treatment of choice is surgical resection with wide margins, especially for cellular lesions and for those that erode bone with invasion of adjacent soft tissues. Microscopically, both peripheral and central lesions consist of variable proportions of collagen and fibroblasts with a uniform histologic appearance. Hyalinization of collagen is variable but is more frequent in the intraosseous lesions. The cells show no features of anaplasia, and although occasional mitoses may be found, they are always normal in appearance.\r"

The radiographs were digitized by means of a drum-scanning microdensitometer with a sampling aperture of 50 microns producing 256 gray levels and corrected for difference of contrast between image pairs. Results were as follows: (1) statistically significant changes were observed even 1 month after the therapy and (2) the extent of changes was quantitatively expressed and monotonically increased with time. These results indicate that subtraction radiography may be a reproducible and quantitative method for the evaluation of periodontal therapy.\r"

The average numbers (+/- SD) of patients in the treatment and control groups were 14.3 +/- 6.9 and 14.5 +/- 7.9, respectively. None of the studies had 80% power to detect a small or medium standardized difference and only 4 of the reports had 80% statistical power to detect a large standardized difference. The variability of cystic fibrosis causes a decrease in the standardized difference, making it more difficult to demonstrate statistical significance.

  ".W": "Forty-eight low-birth-weight, preterm graduates of the University of Washington's neonatal intensive care unit who had received periodic, serial scanning by means of cranial ultrasonography during the first 4 to 6 weeks of life were longitudinally observed in an interdisciplinary neurodevelopmental follow-up program to a mean corrected age of 18 months. Mean birth weight for the sample was 1286 g; mean gestational age was 29 weeks. Periventricular echodensities were graded from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no densities and 3 indicating cystic formation. Intracranial hemorrhage was graded in the conventional manner from 0 to IV. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed by means of a neurologic examination and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. To synthesize the results, neurodevelopmental outcome for each subject was classified as normal, demonstrating minor abnormalities, or demonstrating major abnormalities. Multiple statistical analyses with various subgroupings of subjects consistently indicated severe intracranial hemorrhage (grades III and/or IV) to be a better predictor of overall neurodevelopmental outcome than grade of periventricular echodensity, including small cysts. These results suggest a wide range of outcomes after detection of periventricular echodensities and caution against communicating overly pessimistic prognoses in many cases.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effects of intervention in cerebral palsy, 48 infants 12 to 19 months of age, with mild to severe spastic diplegia, were randomly assigned to receive either 6 months of infant stimulation followed by 6 months of physical therapy (test group) or 12 months of neurodevelopmental physical therapy (contrast group). The infant stimulation protocol consisted of cognitive, motor, sensory, and language activities. Outcome was assessed after 12 months by using Carey Infant Temperament Questionnaire subscores (activity, rhythmicity, adaptability, approach, threshold, intensity, mood, distractibility, and persistence); Roth Mother-Child Relationship Evaluation subscores (acceptance, overprotection, overindulgence, rejection); and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment subscores (maternal responsiveness, avoidance of restriction and punishment, organization of environment, play materials, maternal involvement, and variety of daily stimulation). Motor and cognitive outcomes suggesting advantage for the test group have been reported previously. After 12 months of intervention, mothers with infants in the contrast group showed a greater improvement in emotional and verbal responsiveness as measured by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (mean score change in control group = 1.2, test group = 0.3 P less than .04). None of the 19 other measures differed significantly between treatment groups in change from baseline. This study demonstrates no short-term systematic effect on temperament, maternal-infant interaction, or home environment attributable to the inclusion of an infant stimulation curriculum in an intervention program for infants with spastic diplegia. It suggests that motor and cognitive advantages associated with infant stimulation are not mediated by measurable changes in the psychosocial variables studied.\r"

A nonspecific antibody test is used for screening and a specific treponemal antibody test for confirmation. Because of the complexity of the disease, the sensitivity and specificity of a given test can vary according to disease stage. The physician must understand the limits imposed on testing by the disease process and the special circumstances that prevail in testing patients for prenatal and congenital syphilis as well as neurosyphilis. With early detection and treatment, cure can be achieved and long-term complications avoided.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is undergoing steady change as new medications are approved and new regimens are attempted. Once the diagnosis is ensured, therapy should include appropriate rest, physical and occupational therapy, involvement of the family or a supportive caregiver, and, most important, participation of the patient. If the disease is not terribly aggressive, therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is appropriate initially. If no response is obtained within 2 to 3 weeks, a new dose or different nonsteroidal agent is recommended. In many patients, aspirin, particularly if enteric-coated, is successful and very cost-effective. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are sometimes being used earlier in disease than previously. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil Sulfate), auranofin (Ridaura), or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine, S.A.S.-500) is sometimes effective for early rheumatoid arthritis. For patients with more aggressive disease, intramuscular gold is the drug of first choice, and it is the only one that has been shown to decrease the rate of formation of new erosions. Significant toxic reactions occur in 30% to 40% of patients, however. D-penicillamine (Cuprimine, Depen) and azathioprine (Imuran) can be used if intramuscular gold is unsuccessful. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex Dose Pack) is the newest DMARD approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Its onset of action is rapid, and it is an effective anti-inflammatory agent. Its toxicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is not yet fully understood, however. Combination therapy with DMARDs is in its infancy, but such treatment is likely to become more prevalent in the future.\r"

  ".U": "90160308\r", 
  ".W": "Plasticity of human tumor populations could account for the reason why many tumorigenic human cell lines lose this feature when grown in culture. Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) was used to convert premalignant squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line SCC-83-01-82 to a malignant phenotype. The MMS-treated SCC-83-01-82 cells (MMS-SCC-83-01-82) produced progressively growing tumors in 5 of 11 splenectomized BALB/c nude mice within 3-5 months. A cell line, designated SCC-83-01-82 CA, was established in vitro from one of the mouse tumors and was repassaged successively. This SCC-83-01-82 CA cell line was aggressively tumorigenic. A tumor greater than or equal to 2.0 cm in size was present within a month, as opposed to the 3-5 months required for the tumors produced by the MMS-SCC-83-01-82 cells. Examination of frozen cross sections by in situ hybridization revealed that focal areas of the tumor produced by the MMS-SCC-83-01-82 cells expressed MYC and HRAS mRNA. However, by the third passage in vivo, the levels of expression of the corresponding genes in the mouse tumors were undetectable. Blot-hybridization analysis of the RNA from the MMS-SCC-83-01-82 cells and the subsequently derived tumors and cells did not indicate any consistent overexpression of MYC, HRAS, or KRAS. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of both MYC and HRAS genes revealed neither rearrangement nor amplification of MYC nor point mutation in the 11th or 12th codon of HRAS. The data suggest that alterations in MYC and HRAS were not directly involved in either the initial transformation or MMS-induced tumorigenic conversion of the SCC-83-01-82 cell line. Persistence of tumorigenicity after reisolation of the MMS-converted premalignant SCC-83-01-82 cells did not disappear immediately following the treatment with MMS.\r"

We then showed that several other known phospholipid-binding proteins (bovine lung annexins and human serum lipoproteins) also bind much more tightly to Z-DNA than to B-DNA. In all cases, this Z-DNA binding was strongly blocked by competition with acidic phospholipids, such as cardiolipin. Our results raise the question whether many of the Z-DNA binding proteins previously isolated are actually phospholipid-binding proteins.\r"

A \"fragmenting vector\" has been developed that can introduce a yeast telomere and selectable marker into human-derived YACs at specific sites by means of homologous recombination, deleting all sequences distal to the recombination site. A powerful application of the method uses a human Alu family repeat sequence to target recombination to multiple independent sites on a human-derived YAC. Sets of deletion derivatives generated by this procedure greatly facilitate restriction mapping of large genomic segments. Targeting recombination with single copy sequences, such as cDNAs, will have many additional applications. This approach establishes a paradigm for manipulation and characterization of mammalian DNA segments cloned as YACs.\r"

The pure protein is a 46-kDa dimer composed of two subunits of equivalent mass as established by comparison of migration in SDS/polyacrylamide gels with and without prior reduction. This glioma-derived growth factor is a glycoprotein and is not mitogenic for BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts, properties that further distinguish it from other well-characterized vascular endothelial cell mitogens. In contrast to acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and to platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, which have no secretory leader sequences and might only be released by leakage from damaged cells, the glycoprotein nature of this mitogen implies that it is processed through the glycosylating secretory pathway. This secretable growth factor could, therefore, be readily available in the extracellular space under normal physiological conditions in vivo to promote vascular endothelial cell proliferation associated with blood-vessel growth and maintenance.\r"

To characterize the channel properties of the major rat liver gap junction protein (connexin 32) in isolation from other gap junction proteins, we have introduced the cDNA encoding it into a human hepatoma cell line (SKHep1) in which we have identified a gap junction deficiency. In this cell line, dye coupling was absent and junctional conductance was near zero. Connexins and connexin 32 mRNA were not detectable by immunocytochemistry and Northern blot analysis. After transfection and selection, cells were strongly coupled with regard to dye and electrical current, and connexin 32 mRNA and punctate connexin 32-immunoreactive membrane contacts were abundant. Functional gap junction channels were still expressed after 19 passages of the cells, indicating stable transfection. When junctional conductance was rendered reversibly low by exposing the cells to agents that uncouple other cell types, currents through single gap junction channels could be observed. The unitary conductance of these expressed channels was about 120-150 pS, a value that is distinctly larger than in heart cells, which express a different gap junction protein.\r"

The distribution and density of Na(+)-dependent glutamate uptake sites and glutamate receptor subtypes--kainate, quisqualate, and N-methyl-D-aspartate--were measured in adjacent sections of frontal cortex obtained postmortem from six patients with SDAT and six age-matched controls. The number of senile plaques was determined in the same brain region. Binding of D-[3H]aspartate to Na(+)-dependent uptake sites was reduced by approximately 40% throughout SDAT frontal cortex relative to controls, indicating a general loss of glutamatergic presynaptic terminals. [3H]Kainate receptor binding was significantly increased by approximately 70% in deep layers of SDAT frontal cortex compared with controls, whereas this binding was unaltered in superficial laminae. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.914) between kainate binding and senile plaque number in deep cortical layers. Quisqualate receptors, as assessed by 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-[3H]methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid binding, were unaltered in SDAT frontal cortex compared with controls. There was a small reduction (25%) in N-methyl-D-aspartate-sensitive [3H]glutamate binding only in superficial cortical layers of SDAT brains relative to control subjects. [3H]Glutamate binding in SDAT subjects was unrelated to senile plaque number in superficial cortical layers (r = 0.104). These results indicate that in the presence of cortical glutamatergic terminal loss in SDAT plastic alterations occur in some glutamate receptor subtypes but not in others.\r"

  ".W": "The FMS gene encodes the functional cell surface receptor for colony-stimulating factor 1, the macrophage- and monocyte-specific growth factor. Codons 969 and 301 have been identified as potentially involved in promoting the transforming activity of FMS. Mutations at codon 301 are believed to lead to neoplastic transformation by ligand independence and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. The tyrosine residue at codon 969 has been shown to be involved in a negative regulatory activity, which is disrupted by amino acid substitutions. This study reports on the frequency of point mutations at these codons, in vivo, in human myeloid malignancies and in normal subjects. We studied 110 patients [67 with myelodysplasia (MDS) and 48 with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)], 5 patients being studied at the MDS and the later AML stage of the disease. There was a total incidence of 12.7% (14/110) with mutations in codon 969 and 1.8% (2/110) with mutations in codon 301. Two patients had mutations in the AML stage of the disease but not in the preceding MDS and one had a mutation in the MDS stage but not upon transformation of AML. This is consistent with the somatic origin of these mutations. FMS mutations were most prevalent (20%) in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and AML type M4 (23%), both of which are characterized by monocytic differentiation. One of 51 normal subjects had a constitutional codon 969 mutation, which may represent a marker for predisposition to myeloid malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) continues to be one of the most common complications following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. To study the role of CMV in the suppression of hemopoiesis that frequently accompanies infection, we investigated the effect of CMV on the growth of isolated committed myeloid progenitors and on hemopoiesis in long-term bone marrow cultures. Laboratory strain AD169 had no effect on the growth and development of progenitor cells. In contrast, 40% of clinical isolates of CMV inhibited colony formation by up to 100%. In long-term bone marrow cultures all CMV isolates resulted in myelosuppression, which in the majority of cases was associated with the infection of stromal elements. Analysis of RNA from stromal cells infected with AD169 and one clinical isolate demonstrated a specific deficiency of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor transcripts. For a small proportion of the clinical isolates tested in long-term bone marrow cultures, suppression of hemopoiesis was correlated with infection of developing granulocytes. These studies suggest that CMV can impair hemopoiesis either through infection of stromal cells and consequent perturbation of growth factor production or by direct infection of myeloid cells.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin action appears to require the protein-tyrosine kinase domain of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor. Despite this, the identities and biochemical functions of the cellular targets of this tyrosine kinase are unknown. A phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) that phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring associates with several protein-tyrosine kinases. Here we report that PI 3-kinase activity is immunoprecipitated from insulin-stimulated CHO cells by antiphosphotyrosine and anti-insulin receptor antibodies. Insulin as low as 0.3 nM increased immunoprecipitable PI 3-kinase activity within 1 min. Increases in activity were much greater in CHO cells expressing the human insulin receptor (100,000 receptors per cell) than in control CHO cells (2000 receptors per cell). During insulin stimulation, various lipid products of the PI 3-kinase either appeared or increased in quantity in intact cells, suggesting that the appearance of immunoprecipitable PI 3-kinase reflects an increase in its activity in vivo. These results indicate that insulin at physiological concentrations regulates the PI 3-kinase and suggest that this regulation involves a physical association between the insulin receptor and the PI 3-kinase and tyrosyl phosphorylation.\r"

These antibodies (i) block the in vitro effects of purified insulin mediators and (ii) block the insulin-induced stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in intact BC3H1 myocytes but not insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, generation of diacylglycerol, or generation of insulin mediators. When added to intact cells in the presence of insulin, these antibodies induce the accumulation of insulin mediator activity in the extracellular medium. We therefore conclude that these anti-inositolglycan antibodies block some of the effects of insulin by inhibiting the uptake of specific insulin mediators generated outside the cell.\r"

  ".U": "90160355\r", 
  ".W": "Protein N-myristoylation refers to the covalent attachment of a myristoyl group (C14:0), via amide linkage, to the NH2-terminal glycine residue of certain cellular and viral proteins. Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes this cotranslational modification. We have developed a system for studying the substrate requirements and biological effects of protein N-myristoylation as well as NMT structure-activity relationships. Expression of the yeast NMT1 gene in Escherichia coli, a bacterium that has no endogenous NMT activity, results in production of the intact 53-kDa NMT polypeptide as well as a truncated polypeptide derived from proteolytic removal of its NH2-terminal 39 amino acids. Each E. coli-synthesized NMT species has fatty acid and peptide substrate specificities that are indistinguishable from those of NMT recovered from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that the NH2-terminal domain of this enzyme is not required for its catalytic activity. By using a dual plasmid system, N-myristoylation of a mammalian protein was reconstituted in E. coli by simultaneous expression of the yeast NMT1 gene and a murine cDNA encoding the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A). The fatty acid specificity of N-myristoylation was preserved in this system: [9,10(n)-3H]myristate but not [9,10(n)3H]palmitate was efficiently linked to Gly-1 of the C subunit. [13,14(n)-3H]10-Propoxydecanoic acid, a heteroatom-containing analog of myristic acid with reduced hydrophobicity but similar chain length, was an effective alternative substrate for NMT that also could be incorporated into the C subunit of PK-A. Such analogs have recently been shown to inhibit replication of certain retroviruses that depend upon linkage of a myristoyl group to their gag polyprotein precursors (e.g., the Pr55gag of human immunodeficiency virus type 1). A major advantage of the bacterial system over eukaryotic systems is the absence of endogenous NMT and substrates, providing a more straightforward way of preparing myristoylated, analog-substituted, and nonmyristoylated forms of a given protein for comparison of their structural and functional properties. The system should facilitate screening of enzyme inhibitors as well as alternative NMT fatty acid substrates for their ability to be incorporated into a specific target protein. Our experimental system may prove useful for recapitulating other eukaryotic protein modifications in E. coli so that structure-activity relationships of modifying enzymes and their substrates can be more readily assessed.\r"

We report that the MC29 v-myc gene product induces a strong cellular proliferation of 2-day quail neural crest with the appearance of catecholaminergic traits. Other v-myc as well as the c-myc gene products also trigger this phenotype. Retroviruses carrying some other oncogenes do not elicit this phenotypic expression, although they activate cell multiplication.

This group of evolutionarily conserved proteins presumably all utilize ATP (or some other nucleoside triphosphate) as an energy source for unwinding double-stranded RNA. Members of this family have been implicated in a variety of physiological functions in organisms ranging from Escherichia coli to human, such as translation initiation, mitochondrial mRNA splicing, ribosomal assembly, and germinal line cell differentiation. We have applied polymerase chain reaction technology to search for additional members of the RNA helicase family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify DNA fragments flanked by the highly conserved motifs V L D E A D and Y I H R I G, we have detected five putative RNA helicase genes. Northern and Southern blot analyses demonstrated that these genes are single copy and expressed in yeast. Several members of the RNA helicase family share sequence identity ranging from 49.2% to 67.2%, suggesting that they are functionally related. The discovery of such a multitude of putative RNA helicase genes in yeast suggests that RNA helicase activities are involved in a variety of fundamentally important biological processes.\r"

The results described here indicate that a beta-cell target antigen in non-obese diabetic (NOD/Lt) mice is a molecule cross-reactive with the 65-kDa heat shock protein (hsp65) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The onset of beta-cell destruction is associated with the spontaneous development of anti-hsp65 T lymphocytes. Subsequently hsp65 cross-reactive antigen becomes detectable in the sera of the prediabetic mice and some weeks later anti-hsp65 antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies, and anti-idiotypic antibodies to insulin antibodies become detectable. The hsp65-cross-reactive antigen, the autoantibodies, and the T-cell reactivity then decline with the development of overt insulin-dependent diabetes. The importance of hsp65 in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes was confirmed by the ability of clones of anti-hsp65 T cells to cause insulitis and hyperglycemia in young NOD/Lt mice. Moreover, hsp65 antigen could be used either to induce diabetes or to vaccinate against diabetes, depending on the form of its administration to prediabetic NOD/Lt mice. Other antigens such as the 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) had no effect on the development of diabetes.\r"

We mutated the initiation codon AUG of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene to UAG (CATam1) and translated mRNA derived from the mutant CAT gene in E. coli S-30 extracts. A full-length CAT polypeptide was synthesized in the presence of tRNA(fMetCUA), a mutant E. coli initiator tRNA which has a change in the anticodon sequence from CAU to CUA. Addition of purified E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase substantially stimulated synthesis of the CAT polypeptide. Thus, initiation of protein synthesis with UAG and tRNA(fMetCUA) most likely occurs with glutamine and not methionine. The UAG codon also initiates protein synthesis in vivo. To eliminate a weak secondary site of initiation from AUC, the fifth codon, we further mutagenized the CATam1 gene at codons 2 (GAG----GAC) and 5 (AUC----ACC). Transformation of E. coli with the resultant CATam1.2.5 gene yielded transformants that synthesized CAT polypeptide and were resistant to chloramphenicol only when they were also transformed with the mutant tRNA(fMetCUA) gene. Immunoblot analyses and assays for CAT enzyme activity in extracts from transformed cells indicate that initiation from UAG is efficient, 60-70% of that obtained from AUG. Initiation of protein synthesis from UAG using a mutant initiator tRNA allows tightly regulated expression of specific genes. This may be generally useful for overproduction in E. coli and other eubacteria of proteins which are toxic to these cells.\r"

Four overlapping cDNA clones isolated contain an open reading frame for 543 amino acid residues of the carboxyl-terminal end of a collagenous domain, a 229-residue carboxyl-terminal noncollagenous domain, and 1201 base pairs coding for a 3' untranslated region. The collagenous Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat sequence has five imperfections that coincide with those in the corresponding region of the alpha 1(IV) chain. The noncollagenous domain has 12 conserved cysteine residues and 83% and 63% sequence identity with the noncollagenous domains of the alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) chains, respectively. The alpha 5(IV) chain has less sequence identity with the putative bovine alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV) chains. Antiserum against an alpha 5(IV) synthetic peptide stained a polypeptide chain of about 185 kDa by immunoblot analysis and immunolocalization of the chain in human kidney was almost completely restricted to the glomerulus. The gene was assigned to the Xq22 locus by somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization. This may be identical or close to the locus of the X chromosome-linked Alport syndrome that is believed to be a type IV collagen disease.\r"

Two distinctly different theories of strength augmentation using percutaneous muscle stimulation are presented. The first theory proposes that augmentation of muscle strength with electrically elicited muscle contractions occurs in a similar manner to augmentation of muscle strength with voluntary exercise. Electrically elicited muscle contractions of relatively high intensity with low numbers of repetitions strengthen muscle proportionally to the external load on the muscle in a manner that is equivalent to voluntary contraction. The second theory proposes that augmentation of muscle strength using percutaneous stimulation is fundamentally different from augmentation of strength with voluntary exercise. This theory uses the physiological differences between electrically elicited and voluntary contractions, such as the reversal of motor unit recruitment order, as a basis for argument. Both theories are partially substantiated using published literature. Strategies for testing both theories are also presented.\r"

A questionnaire survey of 165 Alabama physical therapists was conducted to establish 1) the ranking of 24 physical therapy procedures according to the perceived level of complexity and 2) the relationship of a procedure's rank to delegation of that procedure to support personnel. The ranking and a cluster analysis of the 24 procedures correlated with similar ranking in other studies (Pearson r = .92). The level of complexity of a procedure influenced delegation to support personnel, with high-complexity procedures being delegated less frequently and requiring greater supervision than moderate- and low-complexity procedures. There was variation in the frequency of use of procedures, but a clear relationship was not found between a high level of professional involvement and use of high-complexity procedures. A relationship existed between professional involvement and both job title and types of referrals received. Those physical therapists with a higher level of professional involvement tended to be directors and supervisors (chi 2 = 28.29, df = 2, p less than .001), and they received autonomous referrals with greater frequency than those physical therapists with a lower level of involvement (chi 2 = 16.25, df = 3, p less than .001). The findings have implications for the continued professionalization of physical therapy and for the role that physical therapy educators and administrators play in this process.\r"

Also, intimal hyperplasia was consistently found at the anastomotic sites in the arteries, while it was totally absent in the venous anastomoses. Occlusive thrombosis was found in two arteries, one anastomosed with the Unilink system and one sutured. Two other arteries, one from each group, had subtotal occlusions at the anastomotic site. No occlusions occurred in any of the venous anastomoses. The overall patency in this study was 97.5 percent, with no difference between the two techniques.\r"

Age, gender, duration of diabetes, mode of treatment of diabetes and tobacco smoking did not influence whether or not a diabetic with a foot lesion will have major amputation, an unsatisfactory outcome of primary treatment, prolonged hospital stay or will die. Similarly, the presence of foot infections alone, microangiopathy (nephropathy, retinopathy), foot ischaemia alone or neuropathy alone had no relationship to poor prognostic indices. However, when these complications appeared in concert (neuropathy, ischaemia and infection) and when, at presentation, there was associated systemic disease (as shown by anaemia and leucocytosis), severe fasting hyperglycaemia, evident bone destruction and anaerobic superinfection, the outcome of treatment was adverse. In addition, hypertension and infection of the foot were related to need for major amputation. Poor long-term control did not influence prognosis adversely. We therefore suggest that the high morbidity seen with diabetic foot lesions could be reduced by optimizing glycaemic control, using combination antibiotic chemotherapy, vigorously correcting anaemia and encouraging early presentation of even mild lesions before underlying bone disease supervenes.\r"

Of the projected health care costs in the United States of $490 billion, all imaging procedures will account for only $12 billion, and nuclear medicine procedures will account for about $1 billion. Nuclear medicine research continues to blossom. The National Institutes of Health budget for diagnostic imaging research in fiscal year 1988 totaled $86.6 million; nuclear medicine projects represented 43% of this total, all other projects in radiology represented 30%, and projects outside radiology represented 30%. Research with positron emitters and positron emission tomography totaled $20.5 million, and research with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies totaled $6.2 million. Two major problems may hinder the future practice of nuclear medicine in the United States compared with that in other developed countries: (a) the serious time lag in the approval process for new radiopharmaceuticals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other agencies and (b) the lack of a facility dedicated to the continuous production of radionuclides for biomedical research. Now, there is sporadic production permitted only during high-energy physics experiments. The recent developments which will probably induce the greatest changes in clinical nuclear medicine in the near future are the improvements in design and utilization of single photon emission computed tomographic devices and prolific generation of new radiopharmaceuticals, especially technetium-99m agents for cerebral and myocardial imaging and tumor agents.\r"

Abnormalities of the chest radiograph predominated and included pleural effusions (n = 6), consolidation (n = 5), cavitating lesions (n = 1), and intrapulmonary nodules (n = 3), but there were no diagnostic features. The diagnosis was made on the basis of bronchial washings (n = 3), skin aspiration (n = 3), pleural fluid (n = 1), and aspiration biopsy of a pulmonary nodule (n = 1). Computed tomography (CT) was helpful in evaluating chest disease in three cases and allowed guided biopsy to obtain material for a definitive diagnosis. In three patients skin lesions in disseminated disease were associated with cerebral lesions seen at CT. A definitive tissue diagnosis is especially important in patients who have received transplants because of malignancy, since the radiologic manifestations of this unusual infection may mimic metastatic recurrence. Conventional radiography and CT are nonspecific but will enable determination of disease extent and selection of the most suitable site for tissue sampling, which is required to confirm the diagnosis.\r"

Sonography of the consolidated lung showed a wedge-shaped hypoechoic lesion containing a fluid bronchogram. The presumed obstructing tumor was seen as a hypoechoic nodule near the hilum or as a well-defined hyperechoic mass inside the partially consolidated lung. Computed tomography (CT) was superior to US in demonstrating the bronchial obstruction (P less than .05). However, there were no significant differences between CT and US in demonstrating the obstructing tumor (P greater than .10). In all 11 patients the diagnosis was made by means of US-guided transthoracic aspiration biopsy and in eight patients also by means of Trucut biopsy. No complications were observed in the studies. It is concluded that US and US-guided aspiration biopsy are useful adjunct diagnostic techniques for lung tumor patients with obstructive pneumonitis.\r"

Increasing pulsatility of the Doppler signals was demonstrated in 11 patients with severe congestive heart failure. Two patients with severe congestive heart failure showed decreasing pulsatility of portal Doppler signals in response to therapeutic procedures. Portal flow patterns suggestive of severe congestive heart failure include a monophasic forward flow with peak velocity in ventricular diastole and gradual diminution of velocity throughout ventricular systole (n = 5), a reversed flow velocity in ventricular systole (n = 3), and vena cava-like biphasic forward velocity peaks during each cardiac cycle (n = 2). The time-velocity waveform shape of portal flow is, to a large degree, influenced by the mechanical events in the right side of the heart in severe congestive heart failure.\r"

Radiologists were not told the group assignment or tape contents. The patients given the audiotape with instructions to elicit the relaxation response (n = 15) experienced significantly less anxiety (P less than .05) and pain (P less than .001) during the procedure, were observed by radiology nurses to exhibit significantly less pain (P less than .001) and anxiety (P less than .001), and requested significantly less fentanyl citrate (P less than .01) and diazepam (P less than .01) than patients given either the music (n = 14) or the blank (n = 16) control audiotapes.

Technical success was achieved in the placement of 34 of 35 stents (97%) in 27 common and external iliac artery lesions in 19 patients (23 limbs) who presented with disabling claudication, rest pain, or gangrene. Stent placement improved the angiographic results achieved by PTA alone in all 19 patients. Seventeen of 23 limbs (74%) had significant (greater than 20%) elevation of the ankle-arm index after combined angioplasty and stent placement, including nine limbs with occlusive outflow lesions. All 10 patients with continuous runoff distal to the stent and one patient with discontinuous runoff had resolution of their symptoms, remaining unchanged at a mean follow-up time of 6 months. There were three complications: One significantly altered the patient's hospital course, but none detracted from the achieved stent result. Stent placement is effective and does not significantly increase the complication rate of conventional iliac PTA. The current delivery system, however, may limit its utility.\r"

This was considered due to massive release of vasoactive substances into the systemic circulation, caused by manipulation of the tumor at biopsy and aggravated by resuscitative efforts. Hypotensive crisis should be considered a potential, although unusual, complication of FNAB of liver metastases in patients with carcinoid syndrome. If biopsy is necessary, an intravenous access line should be established before biopsy is performed, and personnel should be prepared to administer emergency resuscitation. Medication with a somatostatin analogue before biopsy is performed is suggested. Catecholamine administration should be avoided.\r"

This effect has been thought to represent gallstone fragments in suspension. However, evidence suggests that this finding is in part due to cavitation, a physical phenomenon associated with the formation or movement of gas bubbles in the fluid-filled gallbladder. Condoms filled with degassed water and five human bile specimens were positioned in the focus of an MPL 9000 lithotriptor (Dornier Medical Systems, Munich). A solitary nonradiopaque gallstone was then added to a bile-filled condom, and the sonographic pattern was observed before and after fragmentation. The mean clearance time of the cavitation bubbles was 4 seconds for degassed water and 22 seconds for human bile. Gallstone fragments were distinguished from cavitation bubbles by their prolonged settling time (up to 30 minutes) along the dependent gallbladder wall.\r"

During follow-up observation, four patients died because of complications unrelated to infarct, and five patients underwent splenectomy as a consequence of US findings. Expanding intralienal liquefaction, increasing subcapsular hemorrhage, free peritoneal blood (even in spleens shown to have an intact surface at sonography), and flow phenomena in the area of infarction demonstrated at B-mode pulsed Doppler US were identified as infarct-related complications associated with the risk of splenic rupture. Despite the high self-healing tendency in splenic infarction, short-term follow-up with US is recommended for early recognition of these possible complications.\r"

Immunohistochemical study revealed that AFP was produced by gastric carcinoma in two patients. Multiple metastatic foci in the liver appeared on CT and ultrasound (US) scans in all four patients. Echogenic thrombus was identified in three. There were no CT or US features that enabled differentiation of neoplastic from nonneoplastic thromboses. Angiography showed tumor vessels in only one patient: The thrombus was hypervascular in the arteriocapillary phase of celiac angiography but could not be differentiated from a much more common tumor thrombus seen in hepatocellular carcinoma. Nevertheless, gastric carcinoma should be considered a possibility in the diagnosis of portal venous tumor thrombosis, even if the serum AFP level is elevated and a liver tumor is identified.\r"

Six of the abnormal fetuses had trisomy 21, and seven had other chromosomal abnormalities. The ratio of measured-to-expected femur length (MFL/EFL) was determined for each fetus. The MFL/EFL values were 1.0 +/- 0.7 (mean +/- standard deviation) for the control group, 0.94 +/- 0.06 for trisomy 21 fetuses, 0.94 +/- 0.10 for non-trisomy 21 fetuses, and 0.94 +/- 0.08 for the entire group of fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities. The mean MFL/EFL value for the abnormal fetuses differed significantly from that for the control group (P less than .003). An MFL/EFL of 0.90 or less resulted in a sensitivity of 46.2% and a specificity of 94.1% for detection of all chromosomal abnormalities. For detecting trisomy 21, the sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 93.5%, respectively. Assuming a pretest probability for trisomy 21 of one in 250, an MFL/EFL of 0.90 or less resulted in a positive predictive value of 3%. It is concluded that an MFL/EFL of less than 0.90 modifies the relative risk for chromosomal abnormalities and may significantly influence the decision for amniocentesis.\r"

The article reviews morphologic-histologic observations at angioplasty restenosis sites, speculates about the connection between the acute injury patterns of balloon angioplasty and the development of restenosis, and briefly reviews the currently understood pathways to restenosis and possible approaches to its reduction or elimination.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous placement of caval filters is performed with increasing frequency as an alternative or adjunctive therapy for venous thromboembolic disease. The stainless steel Greenfield filter may be placed surgically or percutaneously. There are now several other approved or investigational devices primarily intended for percutaneous delivery. Morbidity and mortality rates for percutaneous filter placement are lower than those published for surgical filter placement. Choosing among the various devices on the basis of published studies is difficult, as the indications for filter placement; objectivity of follow-up; and criteria for complications, success, and failure vary greatly among studies. The author analyzes published and unpublished data about the physical characteristics; clinical availability; and morbidity, mortality, and efficacy rates of several caval filters. The author concludes that filters should be placed percutaneously rather than surgically, that the ideal device cannot be determined on the basis of current data (and might not exist), and that the choice among devices might depend on clinical circumstances and device characteristics. A strong recommendation is made for an independent, multicenter, prospective, randomized trial and, in the interim, a mandatory registry of all patients receiving caval filters.\r"

These techniques vary in their degree of efficacy, invasiveness, and convenience. They fall into five major categories, based on either the particular characteristic of the C. pylori organism or the manifestation of the C. pylori infection that they detect. The five categories include histologic examination of culture biopsy specimens, serologic examination, rapid urease tests, and carbon isotype breath tests. The observed efficacies of the techniques for detection of C. pylori are influenced by the standard with which they are compared. At present, the best candidate for the \"gold standard\" appears to be histologic detection by examination of multiple mucosal biopsy specimens.\r"

Other bismuth salts and sodium salicylate, a hydrolysis product of BSS in the gut, also were examined and were shown to have various degrees of activity. Growth of the organisms was monitored in vitro by inoculating culture fluid that contained one of the compounds to be tested and determining the concentration of viable organisms over a 24-hour period. Control cultures of each organism were grown in the absence of bismuth subsalicylate. BSS inhibited growth of all organisms examined in a dose-dependent fashion. Reductions of 2-6 logs, as compared with controls, were observed in cultures grown in the presence of 10-50 mM BSS. Other bismuth salts displayed various degrees of inhibition. These results suggest that the efficacy of BSS as an antidiarrheal agent may be related to an antimicrobial mechanism of action.\r"

  ".W": "A controlled, open clinical trial was performed to compare the effect of oral bismuth subsalicylate (600 mg three times daily) with that of cimetidine (800 mg/d) on Campylobacter pylori, ulcer healing, and rate of ulcer relapse in 49 patients with peptic ulcer. At the first endoscopic examination (to confirm the diagnosis) and at the second (after 4 weeks of treatment), biopsy specimens were taken from the gastric antrum; the presence of C. pylori in culture and the rate of ulcer healing were determined. The rate of ulcer relapse was determined by a 9-month follow-up examination. After cessation of treatment a significant rate of healing was seen in both treatment groups: 73% in the bismuth group and 65% in the cimetidine group. Ulcer healing was confirmed by endoscopic examination. Before therapy the number of C. pylori-positive cases (61%) was identical from the two groups; however, after 4 weeks of treatment, 75% of the previously culture-positive cases in the bismuth group reverted to negative (a statistically significant change), whereas only 40% of those in the cimetidine group reverted (not statistically significant). The rate of clearance of C. pylori was statistically significant for the 29 patients with healed ulcers and correlated strongly with ulcer healing in the bismuth group only. The rate of relapse after 9 months of follow-up was 13% in the group treated with bismuth subsalicylate--a figure significantly lower than the 54% rate of relapse in the group treated with cimetidine.\r"

  ".W": "Pepto-Bismol, which contains bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) as the active ingredient, has been marketed in the United States for more than 80 years. In the gastrointestinal tract, BSS is converted to salicylic acid and insoluble bismuth salts. The salicylate portion of BSS is extensively absorbed (greater than 90%) and excreted in urine. The maximal daily dose of Pepto-Bismol (4.2 g of BSS) results in peak concentrations of salicylate in plasma considerably below the level of salicylate toxicity. In contrast, little bismuth from BSS is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (less than .005%). Extended dosing of Pepto-Bismol (3.14 g of BSS/d) for up to 6 weeks produced a mean concentration of bismuth in blood of 16.1 +/- 7.9 ng/g, considerably below concentrations in blood that have been reported to cause neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity studies in animals and human safety data indicate that Pepto-Bismol can be used safely for its acute indications and for up to 3-4 weeks of extended dosing.\r"

  ".W": "Travelers' diarrhea is only mild or moderate in the majority of cases. Consequently, severe fluid and electrolyte losses are encountered only rarely. Secretory, osmotic, and inflammatory processes in the intestine result in increased losses of fluid and electrolytes due to diarrhea. Disorders of intestinal motor activity, coupled with fluid secretion, may also have a role in causing an increase in the frequency of bowel movements. Several systemic symptoms, such as malaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and fever, are commonly associated with diarrhea and contribute to significant morbidity, which is often sufficient to compromise effective participation in a vacation or business trip. Several putative mechanisms for the systemic symptoms associated with travelers' diarrhea are discussed in light of recent understanding of the enteric nervous system, intestinal neuropeptides and hormones, and other inflammatory mediators released from the bowel wall during enteric infections.\r"

  ".W": "Diarrheal diseases are major causes of morbidity, with attack rates ranging from two to 12 or more illnesses per person per year in developed and developing countries. In addition, diarrheal illnesses account for an estimated 12,600 deaths each day in children in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The causes of diarrhea include a wide array of viruses, bacteria, and parasites, many of which have been recognized only in the last decade or two. While enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and rotaviruses predominate in developing areas, Norwalk-like viruses, Campylobacter jejuni, and cytotoxigenic Clostridium difficile are seen with increasing frequency in developed areas; and Shigella, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium species, and Giardia lamblia are found throughout the world. The rational management of infectious diarrhea requires the highly selective use of laboratory tests for these varied etiologic agents, depending on the clinical and epidemiologic setting. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the magnitude, special settings, and etiologies of diarrhea endemic to developed and developing countries. This information permits a practical approach to the diagnosis and management of common diarrheal illnesses in different settings.\r"
