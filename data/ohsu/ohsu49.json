  ".W": "Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration (CAVH) is a new method of renal replacement therapy that has several advantages in the surgical treatment of acute renal failure. We initially learned the technique in laboratory testing and then developed a management protocol. Since 1983 we have used CAVH to treat 61 patients with acute renal failure. This extracorporeal technique consists of arteriovenous cannulation of the femoral vessels, which provides continuous blood flow through a hollow-fiber membrane. Hydrostatic pressure (systole greater than 80 mm Hg) creates an ultrafiltrate at a typical rate of 12 L/day. Volume is replaced with an intravenous solution at a rate to achieve the desired fluid balance, usually a net loss of 1 to 2 L/day. This extracellular fluid exchange typically results in removal of 15 gm of urea nitrogen and 50 mEq of potassium per day. The technique can be used in most intensive care units and has relatively few complications. In addition to being a safe and effective means of renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure, CAVH is particularly advantageous for managing conditions of fluid overload in hemodynamically unstable patients.\r"

This longitudinal study has been in progress now for 7 years with a mean follow-up interval of 50.12 +/- 5.76 months. Among 107 formerly symptom-free, normal hypertensive volunteers, 25 (23%) have developed cerebrovascular disease, 7 (6.5%) sustained a stroke, 10 (9.3%) developed multi-infarct dementia, and 18 (16.8%) have transient ischemic attacks. None have suffered intracranial hemorrhage. Mean gray matter cerebral blood flow (CBF) values measured at the initial visit were sensitive predictors of cerebrovascular disease. Eight of 16 hypertensives (50%) with initial CBF values below 60.0 ml/100 g/min now exhibit signs and symptoms of cerebrovascular disease, while 11 of 43 hypertensives (25.6%) with initial CBF values between 60.1 and 69.9 ml/100 g/min and only 6 of 48 (12.5%) with initial CBF levels above 70.0 developed cerebrovascular disease.

A third patient, with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy, so-called Binswanger's disease, was examined antemortem using a 0.6 tesla scanner. Nuclear magnetic resonance images were reconstructed at levels matching the pathologic specimens. Qualitative and, when available, quantitative comparisons between the results of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and pathology were carried out. Areas of qualitatively prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times on nuclear magnetic resonance imaging were more extensive than the corresponding areas of chronic infarction noted pathologically and were determined to be infarcts plus the adjacent areas of Wallerian degeneration. Hemorrhagic infarction, without evidence of blood on computed tomography, was found to have mildly prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times, between those of normal brain and chronic infarction; a 10-day-old hematoma had a very short T1, slightly shorter than that of white matter, and a mildly prolonged T2, with values between those of white and gray matter. Subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy was found to have areas of prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times involving almost the entire white matter of the corona radiata.\r"

Paired Mantel-Haenszel analysis revealed that alcohol ingestion within 24 (p = 0.07) and 72 (p = 0.001) hours of stroke onset and medical histories of smoking (p less than 0.0001), hypertension (p less than 0.001), and transient ischemic attacks (p = 0.051) were more common among stroke index cases than controls. Matched multiple logistic analysis revealed that both hypertension (p less than 0.05) and smoking (p less than 0.05) were independently associated with stroke, while alcohol consumption was not. In analyses to assess the possibility of mutual confounding effects of independent variables, the effect of alcohol ingestion was lost when adjusting for smoking. We conclude that acute alcohol ingestion is not an independent risk factor for cerebral infarction in middle-aged and elderly patients. The apparent association between alcohol ingestion and ischemic stroke may be the result of the confounding effects of smoking.\r"

The authors assess the incidence and clinical course of symptomatic vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage using a uniform management protocol over a 24-month period. One hundred eighteen consecutive patients were admitted to the neurovascular surgery service within 2 weeks of subarachnoid hemorrhage not attributed to trauma, tumor, or vascular malformation (113 patients had aneurysms). Early surgery was performed whenever possible, and hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution therapy was instituted at the first sign of clinical vasospasm. Forty-two patients (35.6%) developed characteristic signs and symptoms of clinical vasospasm with angiographic verification of spasm in 39 cases. All patients with clinical vasospasm received hypervolemic hemodilution therapy aiming for a hematocrit of 33-38%, a central venous pressure of 10-12 mm Hg (or a pulmonary wedge pressure of 15-18 mm Hg), and a systolic arterial pressure of 160-200 mm Hg (120-150 mm Hg for unclipped aneurysms) for the duration of clinical vasospasm. Over the course of treatment, 60% of patients with clinical vasospasm had sustained improvement by at least 1 neurologic grade, 24% maintained a stable neurologic status, and 16% continued to worsen. At the end of hypervolemic hemodilution therapy, 47.6% had become neurologically normal, 33.3% had a minor neurologic deficit, and 19% had a major neurologic deficit or were dead. There were 3 instances of cardiopulmonary deterioration (7%), all of which were in patients without Swan-Ganz catheters, and all resolved with appropriate diuresis. One patient rebled and died while on hypervolemic hemodilution therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study used an animal model of multifocal cerebral ischemia induced by air embolism and reversed by recompression to assess the effect of induced hypertension on the evoked response recovery, local cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, and brain water in 19 anesthetized dogs (Canis familiaris). Six received 0.4 ml of air via the internal carotid artery, 8 received intracarotid air and 10 micrograms/kg norepinephrine to produce transient hypertension, and 5 received intracarotid saline and norepinephrine. The average evoked response recovery in the air-only group was 58.3 +/- 7.7% (mean +/- SEM) of control after 4 hours of recompression; the air plus hypertension group recovery was 15.4 +/- 2.7% (p less than 0.01). The final evoked response in the dogs receiving hypertension alone did not differ from control values. Seven of 8 dogs in the air plus hypertension group had very low blood flows; only 1 of 4 in the air-only group had very low flows. The amount of brain water and the intracranial pressure were not detectably different at the end of treatment among all 3 groups. These results support a role for endothelial damage produced by air and hypertension in potentiating the process of postischemic hypoperfusion.\r"

The ratio of carotid arterial system TIA to vertebrobasilar arterial system TIA was about 1 to 1. The incidence ratios of stroke were 319.6 in Daisen and 314.5 in Ama per 100,000 people of all ages. The prevalence ratios of stroke were estimated to be 14.8 in Daisen and 13.5 in Ama per 1,000 people of all ages. The prevalence ratio of TIA in Japan is about one-third to one-half of that in Western countries. However, the prevalence of complete stroke is much higher in Japan compared with that in Western countries. Therefore, the ratio of TIA to stroke is much lower in Japan than in Western countries. The obstruction of small intracranial arteries, in addition to heart disease, might play an important role in TIA in Japan, whereas in Western countries TIA might be mostly caused by heart disease or the atherosclerosis of extracranial arteries.\r"

The occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and subarachnoid hemorrhage was 30, 55, and 14%, respectively. Age-specific rates of subarachnoid hemorrhage were higher in women than men; other types of stroke showed a preponderance in men. Total strokes increased in the winter; this seasonal difference was confined to cerebral hemorrhage. Putaminal hemorrhages predominated in the younger age groups; thalamic hemorrhage and cerebellar hemorrhage were predominant in the older age groups. The increased accuracy of the diagnosis of stroke subtypes by the use of computed tomography in this study is in contrast to other community-based epidemiologic studies that have relied solely on clinical diagnosis. This increased accuracy is seen to be the reason that new ratios of stroke subtype incidence have been identified.\r"

The goal of this study was to determine whether MCA occlusion produces a sustained reduction in cerebral blood flow or whether collateral vessels restore blood flow to normal levels. We measured blood flow through cerebral collateral vessels to the territory of the occluded MCA and to homologous tissue of the other hemisphere in WKY 1 month after occlusion of the MCA. Cerebral blood flow, measured with microspheres, was restored to normal levels under control conditions in the territory of the occluded MCA. During vasodilatation produced by seizures, blood flow and vascular conductance were increased to similar levels in tissue distal to the site of MCA occlusion and in the homologous tissue of the other hemisphere. MCA occlusion did not produce infarction in any of the WKY. In contrast, 1 month after MCA occlusion in SHRSP, a large atrophic infarct was invariably present in the territory of the occluded MCA. The number of collateral vessels to the territory of the MCA do not differ in SHRSP and WKY. Internal diameter and orientation of the anastomotic vessels differ in SHRSP and WKY. We conclude that, after 1 month of MCA occlusion, changes in the collateral vessels supplying the territory of the occluded MCA in WKY were sufficient to restore blood flow to normal under control conditions and to virtually normal levels during vasodilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the end of ischemia and at various recirculation times ranging from 15 to 120 minutes, brains were frozen in situ and the regional distribution of ATP, glucose, and tissue pH was studied on coronal cryostat sections by bioluminescent and fluoroscopic techniques. During ischemia ATP was completely depleted, glucose decreased to less than 10% of control, and regional tissue pH decreased from 7.04-7.09 to about 6.0. After the beginning of recirculation tissue pH and the regional content of metabolites exhibited a triphasic course. After 15 minutes pH returned to or even above normal, and ATP- and glucose-induced bioluminescence normalized. However, there was a secondary deterioration of both tissue acidosis and the metabolic state after 30 minutes. After longer recirculation times changes again improved and returned to normal within 2 hours. These changes were similar in all brain regions with the exception of the CA1 sector of the hippocampus, where the transient normalization of tissue pH was absent after 15 minutes of recirculation. This finding is in line with the previously observed microcirculatory insufficiency of this area and demonstrates that the CA1 sector of the hippocampus suffers more pronounced postischemic acidosis than other less vulnerable regions of the brain.\r"

Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine levels were decreased by about 40% and phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine by 25%, while sphingomyelin level remained unchanged. There was a 3.2-fold increase in total free fatty acid content with a relatively larger rise in polyunsaturated free fatty acids 20:4 and 22:6 (20-fold increase). Determination of enzyme activities showed decreases in Na+,K+-ATPase (-21%) and hexokinase (-14%) but no changes in phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Study of energy metabolism using the closed system method of Lowry et al showed a significant depression (-36%) of the cerebral metabolic rate. Taken together, these data suggest a relation between lipid alterations and dysfunction of energy metabolism. Phospholipid degradation with subsequent free fatty acid release and alteration in membrane-bound enzymes may have a direct effect on metabolic machinery and may slow cerebral metabolic rate.\r"

Much less pentane production occurred in animals subjected to global brain ischemia then exposed to an air atmosphere and in animals exposed to a 100% oxygen atmosphere without ischemia. Gerbils placed in 100% oxygen for 3-6 hours after 15 minutes of ischemia also had a threefold increase in 14-day mortality compared with gerbils subjected to ischemia and then placed in an air atmosphere. These findings raise a serious question about the use of oxygen-enriched atmospheres during reperfusion following ischemia.\r"

Specimens from other organs were investigated in one of the patients, and amyloid angiopathy characterized by an immunoreactivity of cystatin C was found in a submandibular lymph node. No immunoreactivity of amyloid fibril protein AA, kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chain, or prealbumin was observed. Significantly low cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of cystatin C were found in all 9 investigated individuals with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis. The concentrations of beta 2-microglobulin, albumin, and IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid were within normal limits. Isoelectric focusing showed that cystatin C from the cerebrospinal fluid of 9 patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis had an isoelectric point identical to that of normal individuals. This investigation demonstrates that hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis may be diagnosed by two laboratory methods: immunohistochemical investigation of cystatin C in brain tissue specimens and quantitation of cystatin C in cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intravenous ketamine (1 mg/kg) on cerebral cortical blood flow and O2 uptake were evaluated in 13 anesthetized, ventilated rabbits. Blood flow was measured either directly (Group 1) or by the H2 clearance method (Group 2). In those animals of Groups 1 and 2 with normal control arterial pH (pHa), ketamine produced a significant increase in cerebral cortical blood flow of 18 and 34%, respectively, but had no effect on cerebral cortical O2 uptake. However, in rabbits with low control pHa, ketamine caused an increase in blood flow (30%) accompanied by a significant increase in O2 uptake (22%). Ketamine produced nonsignificant changes in mean arterial blood pressure and arterial blood gases, except for a significant reduction in pressure in animals with low pHa. It is concluded that ketamine is a cerebral vasodilator without cerebral metabolic effect when mean arterial blood pressure and arterial PCO2, PO2, and pH are held constant at physiologic levels. The vasodilator effect of ketamine is probably due to direct dilating action or activation of a cholinergic cerebral vasodilator system.\r"

Ketamine injection (1 mg/kg) induced a significant cerebral vasodilatation that was blocked by scopolamine, a cholinergic antagonist. In contrast, the increase in cerebral blood flow after ketamine was additive to the cerebral vasodilator actions of inhaled CO2 and of physostigmine infusion, two procedures that activate cholinergic mechanisms. These observations suggest that in rabbits, ketamine activates a cholinergic cerebral vasodilator system.\r"

Animals were treated for 25 +/- 1 days with an oral antihypertensive regimen consisting of hydralazine, reserpine, and chlorothiazide, resulting in normotension within 2 weeks. Cerebral arterioles were examined via a constantly suffused open cranial window and video microscopy. Resting cerebral blood flow was measured using radioactive microspheres and the reference organ method. While untreated SHR exhibited reductions in arteriolar diameter compared with normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), treatment restored arteriolar dimensions to normal. Increments in microvascular wall area, associated with medial hypertrophy in untreated SHR, were completely reversed in treated SHR to a magnitude not different from control. Resting cerebral blood flow was, however, decreased in treated SHR compared with both untreated SHR and WKY; this was due to an increase in total cerebrovascular resistance compared with WKY. Additionally, microvascular pressure in the largest arterioles in treated SHR was reduced compared with both WKY and untreated SHR. There was a significant increase in the relative pressure drop accounted for by the arterial vessels upstream from the cerebral microcirculation in treated SHR. These results suggest that 1) cerebral microvascular abnormalities induced by chronic hypertension are reversed by delayed antihypertensive therapy, and 2) there is a persistent elevation in cerebrovascular resistance upstream from the microcirculation representing large vessel adaptations that may not be readily reversible with treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Due to methodologic difficulties, few investigations have been made on the blood flow velocity in the cerebral microcirculation. Using a newly developed video camera method, we simultaneously measured the blood flow velocity and diameter of pial arteries during hemorrhagic hypotension, after blood pressure recovery, and during CO2 inhalation in cats. When the mean arterial blood pressure was lowered from 129.7 +/- 6.6 to 71.5 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, the blood flow velocity inevitably decreased from 36.6 +/- 5.3 to 27.0 +/- 3.9 mm/sec (p less than 0.001). The calculated blood flow rate [pi X (diameter/2)2 X flow velocity] was preserved in cases with concomitant vasodilation. Conversely, the blood flow velocity increased from 25.3 +/- 5.1 to 31.0 +/- 5.4 mm/sec (p less than 0.001) after mean arterial blood pressure recovery from 67.1 +/- 3.7 to 129.8 +/- 5.8 mm Hg. The blood flow rate was again preserved in vessels with a vasoconstrictive response. Each pial artery apparently dilated or constricted in proportion to the decrease or increase in flow velocity during blood pressure changes, maintaining a constant cerebral blood flow. This indicated the importance of the pial arteries in the mechanisms of cerebral blood flow autoregulation. During 5% CO2 inhalation, the blood flow velocity increased markedly from 25.4 +/- 4.6 to 37.2 +/- 10.0 mm/sec (p less than 0.05), while the pial artery diameter (85.0 +/- 13.7 microns) increased by 9.6 +/- 1.5% (p less than 0.01). The increased flow velocity might be attributable to preferential dilatation of small arterioles or intraparenchymal vessels during hypercapnia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study sought to delineate the temporal relations between postischemic brain edema and the development of spontaneous epileptic activity. Fasted rats were subjected to 10 minutes of forebrain ischemia. One-half of the animals were made hyperglycemic by glucose infusion prior to ischemia. At serial recirculation intervals regional specific gravity and cortical electrolytes were measured. Normoglycemic animals showed a biphasic increase in brain water content that was fully resolved by 96 hours and had no convulsive activities. Hyperglycemic brains, although displaying a slower resolution from an initial transient decrease in specific gravity, also developed an interval with normal water content that persisted at 18 hours postischemia. At 24 hours, an increase in water content recurred and was soon followed by the onset of seizure activity. Cortical electrolyte changes were unremarkable until seizures occurred. Significant increases in total Na+, Cl-, and Ca2+ and a decrease in K+ were then seen. We conclude that while the normoglycemic brain is capable of resolving postischemic edema in this model, the hyperglycemic brain develops a delayed secondary increase in water content followed by the onset of seizure activity accompanied by a deterioration of ionic homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral arteries from monkeys with chronic cerebral vasospasm arising from experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage produced 5-6 days previously were examined for changes in their functional properties in an attempt to understand the basis of the narrowing. Hemorrhage was caused by puncture of the internal carotid artery just proximal to the circle of Willis. Segments taken close to the origins of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries consistently showed decreased distensibility. In addition, they exhibited large, prolonged, spontaneous increases in muscle tone. Other alterations observed include a marked reduction in the capacity of the vessel wall to contract, reduction in constrictor and dilator nerve influences on vascular tone, and some increased sensitivity to serotonin. Small pial arteries (150-200 micron o.d.) from the side of the injury showed large spontaneous irregular increases in tone. It is proposed that 5-6 days after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in monkeys the change most responsible for persistent narrowing in the larger arteries is an increased rigidity of the vessel wall. This is probably caused by an inflammatory response. In the smaller arteries, abnormal spontaneous contractile activity is a major factor in narrowing. This activity is not stretch-dependent. We suggest that the initial cause of the arterial narrowing after hemorrhage is the action of vasoactive substances released in the close vicinity of the arterial wall, which lead to tissue damage, abnormal tone, and an inflammatory response with fibrosis.\r"

Thirty-five rabbits that had 2 successive blood injections were divided into 3 groups: normal animals (control), 4 days, and 3 weeks after the first SAH. Acetylcholine (ACh) (10(-6)-10(-4) M) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (10(-6)-10(-4) M) were used to evoke dose-dependent vasodilation of isolated arterial rings previously contracted by 10(-6) M serotonin. In the animals killed 4 days after the first SAH, both ACh- and ATP-induced relaxation were suppressed, and the degree of relaxation of this group was 38 +/- 4.5% (mean +/- SEM) and 22 +/- 3.9% of the initial contractile tone in response to 10(-4) M ACh and 10(-4) M ATP, respectively. Suppression of the relaxation induced by ATP was seen even in the animals killed 3 weeks after the first SAH. Moreover, pretreatment with hemoglobin (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by ACh in the arterial rings from the animals killed 4 days after the first SAH. The present experiments suggest that impairment of the endothelium-dependent vasodilation following SAH may be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

Twenty-four hours after ischemia, 11-HETE appeared, and the amount of 15-HETE tended to increase. Seventy-two hours after ischemia, when brain edema reached its maximum, 5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12-, and 15-HETEs were identified, and the amounts of all HETEs except 8- and 12-HETE were significantly increased. The detection of 5-HETE in ischemic rat brain indicates the simultaneous production of leukotrienes in the same brain area. The above results support the view that lipoxygenase products may play significant roles in the formation of ischemic brain edema.\r"

We attempted to increase the objectivity of motor function evaluation by adapting quantifiable behavioral tests and actively testing rats' motor capability following a cerebral ischemic insult. It was hypothesized that active testing would reveal motor deficits which were not readily apparent upon casual observation and that such testing would provide a more sensitive means of experimental neurologic assessment. Wistar rats were exposed to reversible severe forebrain ischemia using the four-vessel occlusion technique. Motor function was evaluated using the total motor score (sum of scores for screen test, balance beam test, and prehensile-traction test) over the 48 hours which followed 20 minutes of cerebral ischemia. To manipulate neurologic outcome, rats were fed or fasted the day prior to ischemia and then pretreated with either 1,3-butanediol or saline. Fasted saline-treated animals demonstrated improved total motor performance compared with fed animals by 48 hours after ischemia. There was no improvement in motor performance by fasted vs. fed rats from among the butanediol-treated animals. Pretreatment with butanediol resulted in significantly better total motor performance among fasted rats 24 hours after ischemia; however, by 48 hours postischemia, no difference was detectable. This is the first demonstration of motor deficits produced by four-vessel occlusion in rats. The motor tests devised appear to be adequately sensitive to detect changes in motor function that are not apparent with passive observation in this model.\r"

When angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was confirmed 7 days after the initial intracisternal blood injection, a selective inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, 2-(12-hydroxydodeca-5,10-diynyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-1,4-benzoqu inone (AA-861), was infused intravenously at 6.5 X 10(-4) mg/kg/min for 2 hours. However, angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was not reversed, and mean regional cerebral blood flow was not significantly increased. In other studies, oral doses of AA-861 at 100 mg/kg/day were given twice a day for 7 days after the initial intracisternal blood injection. In the treated group, angiographic evidence of delayed vasospasm was significantly reduced, and the contractile property of excised basilar arteries in response to vasoconstrictor agents was significantly improved. It is suggested that leukotrienes, 5-lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid, might be important etiologic factors responsible for the development of delayed vasospasm and that AA-861 would have a therapeutic effect not on the reduction of delayed vasospasm once developed but on the prevention of the development of delayed vasospasm.\r"

In 206 cases of PIH, hypertension was diagnosed if heart weight greater than or equal to the mean heart weight of autopsy controls for either sex, plus 1.5 SD. Only 94 (46%) of all cases of PIH were hypertensive by this criterion. However, hypertension was five times more frequent in the cases than in the controls. The site of hemorrhage was clearly defined in 183 cases (88.8%) only. Of these, 80 (43.7%) had lobar hemorrhage and 69 (37.7%) bled in the basal ganglia. Only 26 cases (12.6%) had evidence of previous cerebral or myocardial infarction and there was no instance of previous intracerebral hemorrhage. These data show that arterial hypertension was present in about half the cases of PIH and suggest that other as yet unidentified risk factors for PIH may be more common than is realized. Patients who died from PIH had been healthy all their lives with no evidence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and the PIH was their first evidence of disease.\r"

This same technique of exact patient positioning may have application in the treatment of some lower ureteral calculi.\r"

The ureters were implanted in each end of the loop via an antireflux tunneling technique. There was no operative mortality, and the complications associated with this form of bladder replacement were minimal. All 10 patients had sensations of filling, and 8 of 10 achieved full daytime continence with complete voluntary emptying. Enuresis was present in all patients and required condom catheters during sleep, which were well tolerated. We believe that a tubular sigmoid segment is an acceptable alternative to tubular ileum or cecum for total bladder replacement.\r"

Any surgical decision should be based on this type of investigation. In most cases of pelvic crush injuries, the severed membranous urethra probably remains attached in close proximity to the distal segment, thus directing the redescent of the prostate and bladder base in the presence of a contracting pelvic hematoma.\r"

The results demonstrated concurrence of interpretation of both techniques. However, whereas the results of Snap-Gauge testing clearly distinguished between organic and psychogenic impotence, continuous penile rigidity monitoring usually delineated the nature of the penile erectile abnormality.\r"

This study clearly invalidated the Marshall-Marchetti test by objectively demonstrating that the Marshall-Marchetti test restored continence under stress of coughing by occluding the urethra and the urethrovesical junction.\r"

We also advocate that biopsy be performed in all individuals; although, since no pathognomonic abnormalities are demonstrable, it is unclear if the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis can be established or excluded by biopsy alone (unless, of course, another disease is encountered). While urodynamic studies are primarily useful to rule out interstitial cystitis, they may, in addition, have a role in subsequent management and/or in assessment of therapeutic response and thus, at least simple cystometry should probably also be performed. However, more complex urodynamic (e.g., electromyography, urethral pressure profilometry, etc.), radiographic (e.g., intravenous urography, voiding cystourethrography, or computerized axial tomography), laboratory or surgical (e.g., laparoscopy, prostate biopsy) studies are of minimal value in diagnosing interstitial cystitis and should only be done in the face of clinical evidence indicating their appropriateness.\r"

PMN adherence was measured as retention on an albumin-coated glass surface. PMN adherence was reduced by 4-54% by the Catharantus derivatives, as compared with control values. The suppression of adherence was statistically significant. Since the Catharantus derivatives are microtubule antagonists, it is reasonable to assume that PMN adherence is a partially microtubule-dependent process. It is suggested that reduction of PMN adherence could account for at least part of the immunosuppressive properties of the Catharantus derivatives.\r"

ECG signs indicating subclinical heart disease (major Q wave, ST depression, T wave inversion) were risk factors for development of angina pectoris and congestive heart failure. Heart enlargement on chest X-ray was also a risk factor for development of congestive heart failure, as were a high serum creatinine, body mass index, serum uric acid and proteinuria. Smoking was found to be a strong and independent risk factor for any one of these cardiovascular disorders. After 10 years about one fourth of all patients, still attending the clinic, had at least one cardiovascular complication. Hence, the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders is substantial and seems to be potentiated by the same risk factors known to operate in the general population.\r"

These were younger than the rest of the study population (55 +/- 13 vs. 62 +/- 6 years, p less than 0.05) and 15 (71%) of them were men. Endocarditis and chordal rupture occurred in 19% and 43% of the MVP patients. Sixteen patients (33%) had MR secondary to myocardial infarction while only three patients (6%) had MR of rheumatic aetiology. Bacterial endocarditis, hypertensive heart disease, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and mitral annulus calcification were less frequently found. Mitral valve replacement was done in 20 (57%) of the patients with severe MR and MVP was the underlying disease in 15 (75%) of these patients. In conclusion, MVP is a frequent cause of pure isolated MR and of mitral valve replacement. In contrast to the preponderance of young females amongst MVP patients in population surveys, most of the MVP patients with MR in this study are middle-aged and elderly men.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and echocardiographic features of cardiac amyloidosis may closely resemble those of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the disorders may thus be mixed up. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to identify features separating the two conditions by analysis of electro- and echocardiographic findings in patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Twenty-nine patients with familial amyloidosis and 22 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were studied. Particular attention was given to the sum of the S wave in V1 and R wave in V5 or V6, the echocardiographic left ventricular mass and cross-sectional area, the presence or absence of asymmetrical septal thickening, granular and sparkling myocardial appearance, thickened heart valves, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and pericardial effusion. A granular and sparkling appearance of the myocardium and thickened heart valves were found to be the best predictors of cardiac amyloidosis, while low QRS amplitudes in relation to echocardiographic left ventricular mass and a pericardial effusion seemed less important. The presence of systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve, a large left ventricular mass and a sum of S in V1 and R in V5 or V6 greater than 35 mm indicated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. When the four strongest predictors (left ventricular mass, thickened heart valves, a granular sparkling myocardial appearance, and systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve) were used to reclassify the present patients, 28 of 29 amyloidosis patients and 21 of 22 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were correctly categorized. Noninvasive methods may thus be useful for detecting the myocardial infiltrative process, and cardiac amyloidosis may be confidently diagnosed by typical noninvasive findings together with histopathological documentation of amyloid in an organ other than the heart.\r"

However, a thorough case history has been considered by others to give the same information regarding the anginal mechanism. Therefore a bedside ergonovine test (0.075-0.675 mg i.v.) was performed in 21 consecutive patients with effort angina in order to study the relation between the outcome of the test and the case history concerning angina at rest. A coronary angiography was performed in all cases and showed significant stenoses in 17 patients and normal coronary arteries in 4. Eight patients had angina only during effort, 11 had angina both during effort and at rest and 2 patients had atypical chest pain. Ten of the 11 patients with concomitant rest angina developed chest pain at the ergonovine test and 9 coexisting ECG changes. However, these effects were about as common among the 8 patients without angina at rest: 7 developed chest pain and 4 also ECG changes. The two patients with atypical chest pain had normal coronary angiograms and in these patients ergonovine provoked the same atypical chest pain but no ECG changes. Thus, a concomitant angina at rest is a common finding among patients with severe effort angina. However, the response to ergonovine was as common in the group with only effort angina as in the group with concomitant rest angina, indicating the limited value of this test in patients with severe angina.\r"

The cumulative 5-year survival was 100% in the embolectomy group, compared to 75 +/- 7% (SE) in the medically treated patients (p less than 0.05). Cancer caused 78% of the late deaths. At follow-up 0.5-8.7 years after treatment the treatment groups were indistinguishable as regards right-sided heart catheterization data, pulmonary artery rest-obstruction, right ventricular diameter and wall thickness, ventilatory function and ECG changes. The embolectomized patients were in a more favourable NYHA classification level than the medically treated. Chronic pulmonary artery hypertension was found in 75% of patients with greater than or equal to 3 anamnestic recurrent embolic episodes before diagnosis compared to 8% of patients with less than or equal to 2 recurrent episodes (p less than 0.001). Patients with irreversible cardiocirculatory shock before embolectomy all had abnormal pulmonary vascular resistance (greater than 1.5 mmHg/l/min), depressed ventilatory function and more than 25% reduced pulmonary perfusion at follow-up. The major prognostic factors thus were cancer, the number of recurrent episodes and the degree of cardiocirculatory affection in the acute event. Although the embolectomized patients were the most affected initially, they had a good prognosis. This led us to extend our indications for embolectomy to include all patients with central emboli, irrespective of the degree of cardiocirculatory impairment.\r"

Ergometer bicycling until exhaustion, which caused marked accumulation of lactic acid in the blood and reduction of pH, induced great elevations of both plasma potassium and phosphate with close relationships between the raised plasma concentrations and the reduction in pH, also during beta-blockade. However, longer-term aerobic exercise, without acidosis, also caused some rise of the potassium and phosphate concentrations. During recovery from anaerobic, but not from aerobic, exercise there was a rapid decrease of the plasma potassium levels while the phosphate values normalized gradually together with pH. From measurements of the ion concentrations both in the femoral effluent of one leg, which carried out maximal isokinetic work, and in the opposite antecubital vein it could be calculated that there was for potassium, but not for phosphate, a post-exercise uptake both in the exercised muscle and in the entire organism, indicating the participation of systemic factors.\r"

  ".W": "During the tenth biennial examination, 1315 Framingham study participants free of cardiovascular disease had fibrinogen measured along with other major cardiovascular risk factors including cigarette smoking. The fibrinogen values were significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, increased with the amount smoked in each sex, and exsmokers had values as low as those of nonsmokers. Over 10 years of follow-up, 165 men and 147 women developed cardiovascular disease, the risk in both sexes increasing progressively in relation to antecedent fibrinogen values over the 180 to 450 mg/dl range. Risk gradients for cardiovascular disease in men diminished with advancing age. In men, risk of cardiovascular disease was related to cigarette smoking. This was true in the multivariate case taking all standard risk factors into account. As for fibrinogen, the impact diminished with advancing age. Regression coefficients were actually larger in the multivariate than in the univariate case because of a negative correlation between smoking and blood pressure. Fibrinogen contributed to cardiovascular disease, risk taking into account both cigarette smoking and other risk factors. When fibrinogen is added to the multivariate model for prediction of cardiovascular disease the coefficient for smoking becomes much reduced and is no longer statistically significant. However, each independently contributed to risk in cross-sectional analysis. These data provide another mechanism whereby cigarette smoking influences the occurrence of atherocardiovascular disease and also another reason for prohibiting cigarette use.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed 23 surgically-excised MVP and 10 control mitral valves removed at necropsy. Two-dimensional echocardiograms (2DE) were available in 10 MVP and in six additional controls. 2DE accurately assessed the length of anterior leaflet (AL) and posterior leaflet (PL) of the mitral valve (3.2 +/- 0.7 cm and 2.2 +/- 0.6 cm, respectively) as compared to morphologic measurements (3.0 +/- 0.4 cm and 2.1 +/- 0.4 cm, respectively). However, annular diameter as assessed by echocardiography was significantly less (4.6 +/- 0.7 cm) than that derived by morphologic measurements of annular circumference (AC) (5.3 +/- 0.7 cm). The AL and PL lengths and the mitral anuli were significantly larger in patients with MVP as compared to controls (p less than 0.01) when assessed both by 2DE and by morphology. The ratio of the maximum distance of chordal separation/AC was 0.11 +/- 0.04 in MVP and 0.13 +/- 0.02 in controls (p less than 0.05). Chordal divisions were increased in MVP (4.2) compared to controls (3.1, p less than 0.01). The most striking morphologic feature of MVP was abnormal chordal insertion and a random, unpredictable pattern of chordal distribution. We postulate that abnormal chordal architecture may be responsible for unequal stress on the valve leaflets and may thus lead to MVP.\r"

Patients with mild (grade I) 2DE MVP differed significantly from those with moderate (grade II) to severe (grade III) 2DE MVP. Mild prolapse patients were predominantly female (p = 0.05) and younger (p less than 0.01). Atypical physical findings were associated with mild MVP while mitral insufficiency murmurs were associated with moderate to severe MVP (p less than 0.0025). When present, atypical chest pain and/or low-grade ventricular ectopy were associated with mild 2DE MVP, while pulmonary congestion, high-grade ectopy, and/or endocarditis were associated with moderate to severe 2DE MVP (p less than 0.001). Symptomatic moderate to severe 2DE MVP patients tended to have large annular dimensions. Additional echocardiographic characteristics of mild 2DE MVP included insensitivity of the parasternal long-axis 2DE view in its detection (p = 0.00002), predominance of anterior leaflet involvement in the apical 2DE view (p = 0.01), and absence of significant difference from age- and sex-matched control subjects in any annular dimension. In contrast, moderate to severe 2DE MVP showed highly significant differences from age- and sex-matched control subjects and from each other in all annular dimensions. Echocardiographically mild MVP defines a subgroup which differs quantitatively and clinically from more advanced morphologic variants. The use of mild 2DE MVP as a diagnostic criterion for MVP should be qualified as being \"of questionable diagnostic significance.\" When present, with or without corroborative auscultatory findings, it may define a subgroup of prolapse at lower risk of significant clinical events or one that represents a normal echocardiographic variant. New grading and annular measurement methodologies provide additional tools for 2DE analysis of MVP with potentially important clinical and prognostic implications.\r"

Fourteen patients underwent primary valve replacement and four underwent repeat valve replacement. The mean age was 11.5 years (range 2 to 17 years). The 2D-ECHO measured mitral or aortic valve anulus was compared with the external diameter of the largest prosthetic valve that could be inserted. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.99, p less than 0.001, SEE = 1.0 mm) between the 2D-ECHO measurements and the prosthetic valve size in patients undergoing primary valve replacement, but the correlation (r = 0.16, p = NS) was poor for those undergoing repeat valve replacement. In conclusion, 2D-ECHO prediction of prosthetic mitral and aortic valve size is accurate in children undergoing primary valve replacement but is poor in those undergoing repeat valve replacement.\r"

Among 686 patients with acute MI, 115 (16.8%) died during hospitalization and eight were lost to follow-up. The cumulative mortality rate of the 563 hospital survivors was 6.2% in the first year, 12.0% in the third year, and 19.1% in the fifth year, with cardiac death accounting for 63% of the deaths. Cumulative rates for recurrent MI were 4.4% in the first year, 11.0% in the third year, and 13.2% in the fifth year. Parameters influencing long-term mortality rates obtained by stepwise discriminant analysis were arteriosclerosis-related factors, presence of congestive heart failure at admission, age, and presence of previous MI, while parameters influencing the recurrence of MI were congestive heart failure, arteriosclerosis-related factors, and ischemic findings at discharge. Our findings indicate that the prognosis for patients with MI is far better in Japan than in Western countries and support the previous reports on the low incidence of ischemic heart disease in Japan, while factors influencing the prognosis are similar to those previously reported.\r"

Twenty-seven dogs had a coronary thrombus induced by a copper coil positioned directly in a major coronary artery; of these, four died of ventricular fibrillation prior to treatment, eight received an infusion of saline and showed no thrombolysis over 5 hours, and three died of ventricular fibrillation during the initial part of an intravenous infusion of ancrod. The remaining 12 dogs received ancrod intravenously (16 U/kg); six demonstrated lysis of the coronary thrombus (mean time to lysis, 65 +/- 20 minutes). The concentrations of ancrod used in these studies produced a severe decrease in systemic fibrinogen concentration and a significant decrease in the inhibitor of plasminogen activator levels. Thus, ancrod decreases the frequency of cyclic flow variations in stenosed canine coronary arteries and may cause coronary thrombolysis in approximately 50% of animals within 65 +/- 20 minutes of its intravenous administration.\r"

  ".W": "Isoproterenol has been used experimentally and clinically to elicit ischemia. The usefulness of this approach, however, in eliciting regional dysfunction in the presence of mild to moderate single-vessel coronary disease quantitated on the basis of coronary flow reserve measurements has not been previously defined. Open-chest, anesthetized dogs were instrumented with an electromagnetic flow probe, high-fidelity micromanometers, and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. A rigid, screw occluder was used to produce five subcritical coronary stenoses in each dog associated with varying impairment of postocclusion reactive hyperemia at rest but no impairment of resting coronary blood flow. Regional function at rest and in response to the isoproterenol challenge (0.25 micrograms/kg/min) in nonstenotic and stenotic conditions was assessed. Relative regional function was maintained during the infusion until nearly total loss of coronary flow reserve. With this near-critical stenosis, function was lower than in the nonstenotic state but remained greater than resting control values. Moderate impairments of coronary flow reserve were not associated with isoproterenol-induced deterioration of regional function. In conclusion, detection of impaired coronary flow reserve at rest is a more sensitive index of the severity of a coronary stenosis than is detection of regional dysfunction during isoproterenol challenge. Failure to maintain the expected isoproterenol-induced increase in regional function is manifested only when stenoses are associated with nearly total loss of resting coronary flow reserve. This suggests that the clinical use of isoproterenol challenge is not effective in eliciting regional dysfunction when mild coronary disease is present.\r"

In all patients a serum concentration measurement was obtained shortly after starting lidocaine infusion. In 22 patients a microcomputer program based on a Bayesian forecasting technique was used for dosing recommendations, whereas in 41 the serum concentration was interpreted and the dose was adjusted by the unaided physician. Both groups were similar with respect to the average concentration achieved (control: 3.8 +/- 1.13 [SD] mg/L, computer-aided: 3.5 +/- 0.59 mg/L). However, the interindividual variability was significantly larger in the control group (95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 6.1 mg/L vs 2.3 to 4.7 mg/L [p less than 0.01]). Nine of the 41 patients in the control group had a lidocaine concentration outside the recommended therapeutic range of 2 to 5 mg/L compared to only 1 of 22 in the computer-aided group. Lidocaine concentrations greater than 2 mg/L were associated with significantly more effective suppression of ventricular arrhythmias (p less than 0.05). The results show that Bayesian forecasting outperforms the physician in early adjustment of lidocaine dosage based on serum concentration measurements.\r"

In six patients consecutive P-P intervals during phase II were recorded in solid-state memory and were used to trigger pacing of the high right atrium at rest. This showed a significant increase in the AH interval (75 +/- 10 to 123 +/- 45 msec, p less than 0.05). Valsalva maneuver during constant rate atrial pacing resulted in a significant decrease in the AH interval during phase II (115 +/- 36 to 80 +/- 15 msec, p less than 0.001). During phase IV there was prolongation of the AH interval (156 +/- 58 msec) but in 11 patients (61%) a variable degree of Wenckebach periodicity appeared. Thus autonomic tone modulates the changes in AVN conduction induced during physiologic heart rate variation, resulting in maintenance of adequate 1:1 AVN conduction.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiologic effects of the new antiarrhythmic drug, propafenone, were evaluated in anesthetized closed-chest dogs and on isolated cardiac tissues with the microelectrode technique. Propafenone (2 to 4 mg/kg intravenously) had no effect on sinus rate or on sinus nodal recovery time, but caused a dose-dependent significant decrease in the rate of idioventricular rhythm and increased the duration of ventricular overdrive suppression in dogs (n = 8) with complete atrioventricular block. On isolated canine Purkinje fibers (n = 8) manifesting automaticity with resting membrane potential less negative than -70 mV, propafenone reduced the slope of phase 4 depolarization and reduced the rate of automatic impulse initiation in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-6) M-4.10(-5) M). At these concentrations, propafenone had no effect on rabbit sinus nodal automaticity (n = 8) or on sinoatrial conduction. However, significant depression of sinus nodal automaticity occurred with propafenone concentrations above 5.10(-6) M in the presence of cholinergic or complete autonomic blockade with atropine (10(-6) M) and propranolol (5.10(-5) M). Propafenone caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the disparity of Purkinje fiber-ventricular muscle action potential duration (APD), mainly by shortening Purkinje fiber APD. We conclude: that propafenone suppresses idioventricular rhythm in the intact dog, most likely by depressing Purkinje fiber automaticity; the depressant effect of propafenone on sinus nodal automaticity is evident only during cholinergic receptor blockade; and the antiarrhythmic properties of propafenone may include removal of APD disparity by selective shortening of Purkinje fiber and not of ventricular muscle APD.\r"

  ".W": "N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) is the active metabolite of procainamide currently undergoing evaluation for its antiarrhythmic properties. Its effects on hemodynamic variables and on ventricular function in man are poorly defined. The effects of intravenously administered NAPA (18 mg/kg over 30 minutes; mean plasma level 40.2 +/- 6.2 micrograms/ml) on hemodynamics and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by radionuclide ventriculography were therefore determined in 14 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization. The peak effects of the drug with respect to most measured variables were seen at 30 minutes and were still apparent at 60 minutes. NAPA increased heart rate (3% at 10 minutes; p less than 0.01), decreased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (14%; p less than 0.05) and capillary wedge pressure (27%; p less than 0.01), decreased mean arterial pressure (12%; p less than 0.01), cardiac index (8%; p less than 0.01), LV dp/dtmax (9%; p less than 0.05), and stroke work index (17%; p less than 0.01). The LVEF increased 5% (p less than 0.05). There was a trend for the systemic vascular resistance to decrease, but this did not reach statistical significance. The data show that NAPA exerts relatively weak peripheral arteriolar and venodilator effects associated with a mild reduction in contractility and cardiac output but an increase in LVEF in patients with preserved ventricular function.\r"

There was no significant difference in sex distribution, mean age, or the incidence of coronary heart disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, or renal failure between groups 1 and 2. Overall, the predicted cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 89%, 82%, and 74%, respectively, for group 1 and 94%, 86%, and 78%, respectively, for group 2. In patients with preexistent congestive heart failure (CHF), predicted cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 78%, 69%, and 57%, respectively, for group 1 (n = 23) and 90%, 83%, and 75%, respectively, for group 2 (n = 16). Five-year predicted cumulative survival was significantly lower in group 1 patients with CHF than in group 2 patients with CHF (p less than 0.03). There was no significant difference in 5-year cumulative survival rates between groups 1 and 2 in patients without CHF. The results suggest that permanent dual-chamber pacing enhances survival to a greater extent than permanent ventricular demand pacing in patients with chronic symptomatic sinus node dysfunction and CHF.\r"

The peak rate of change in dimension during systole (-dD/dt) was reduced in active SLE compared with normal control subjects (2.57 +/- 0.15 cm/sec vs 3.37 +/- 0.14 cm/sec, p less than 0.01). The peak rate of change in dimension during diastole (+dD/dt) was also reduced in active SLE compared with normal control subjects (3.16 +/- 0.19 cm/sec vs 4.41 +/- 0.20 cm/sec, p less than 0.01). After therapy, -dD/dt in inactive SLE was improved compared with active SLE (from 2.56 +/- 0.20 cm/sec to 3.13 +/- 0.19 cm/sec, p less than 0.001). Positive dD/dt in inactive SLE was also improved compared with active SLE (from 3.29 +/- 0.22 cm/sec to 4.23 +/- 0.23 cm/sec, p less than 0.01). No significant differences were found between inactive SLE and normal control subjects as to -dD/dt and +dD/dt. Significant correlations were found between anti-DNA antibody titers and both -dD/dt and +dD/dt (r = -0.97 p less than 0.0001, and r = -0.71 p less than 0.05, respectively). These results suggest that active SLE patients have left ventricular dysfunction that may be caused by an immunopathologic mechanism in SLE.\r"

Thirty-nine patients had blunt trauma (group I), and 37 had penetrating trauma (group II). The 2DE findings in group I were: no visible abnormality in 19, pericardial effusions in six, and wall motion abnormalities in two; the studies were technically inadequate in six. In group II patients, the 2DE findings were: no visible abnormality in 14, pericardial effusions in 12, wall motion abnormalities in three, and unusual abnormalities such as foreign body or intrathoracic air in three; the studies were technically inadequate in four. This study shows that satisfactory 2DE can be performed in up to 87% of unselected patients who sustain chest injuries and does provide clinically valuable information that cannot be easily obtained by other noninvasive tests. In this series, 2DE was of greatest value in the detection of pericardial effusions that were present in 27% and of unusual abnormalities including intrathoracic air and foreign bodies such as a bullet.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine if the thickened cardiac walls of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) are due to increased size or number of myocytes or increased amounts of fibrous tissue. Eight patients, aged 18 to 42 years, who died from complications of HC and 8 age-matched control subjects without heart disease were studied. A 1.5-cm3 block of tissue was removed from the left ventricular free wall, right ventricular free wall and ventricular septum (VS). Each region of each wall was evaluated for fibrous tissue by point counting; cell diameter was measured using an ocular micrometer disc. Cell layers were counted across the walls. The results revealed that increased cell size, cell layers and fibrous tissue are characteristic of HC, but only in the VS are all 3 significantly increased. The fibrous tissue was most extensive in the VS (19 +/- 9%), but it was more extensive than in the control subjects in all 3 walls. Cell diameters were largest in the layers closest to the left ventricular cavity.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the safety and efficacy of inferior vena caval (IVC) balloon occlusion for preload alteration in humans, 13 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied before and during repeated (total of 78) IVC occlusions. Left and right ventricular (LV and RV) micromanometer pressures were simultaneously measured and M-mode and 2-D echocardiograms were recorded at end expiration. Complications were limited to abdominal discomfort in 2 patients. With IVC occlusion, RV collapse fluoroscopically shifted the heart toward midline and ventricular septal motion was frequently disordered. Significant (p = 0.001) changes occurred in RV and LV systolic peak pressures (from 19 +/- 6 to 12 +/- 5 mm Hg and from 129 +/- 34 to 109 +/- 25 mm Hg, respectively). LV and RV end-diastolic pressures also decreased significantly (from 18 +/- 7 to 6 +/- 6 mm Hg and from 5 +/- 3 to 2 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively) (both p less than or equal to 0.0055). Similarly, LV end-diastolic diameter decreased 13% (from 61 +/- 11 to 53 +/- 12 mm, p = 0.0002). Mean heart rate did not change significantly (from 76 +/- 19 to 78 +/- 21 beats/min). Thus, IVC balloon occlusion provides a safe method of repeatedly altering loading conditions in humans. This approach allows for acquisition of important information regarding cardiac chamber dynamics while minimizing the effects of reflex mechanisms and avoiding use of pharmacologic agents.\r"

Previous operations included end-to-end anastomosis (n = 10), subclavian flap angioplasty (n = 7) and patch angioplasty (n = 3) for aortic coarctation, end-to-end anastomosis for interrupted aortic arch type B (n = 4) and aortic arch reconstruction for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n = 3). Two of the patients with interrupted arch had multiple areas of obstruction. Balloon sizes were between 2 and 6 times the diameter of the lesion and up to twice the diameter of the proximal transverse arch (mean 1.1). BDA was at least partially successful (more than 50% decrease in gradient and more than 30% increase in diameter) in 26 of the 29 procedures (90%). BDA failed in the 2 lesions with an initial diameter of more than 8 mm. No differences were apparent in the success rate among any of the clinical groups. Peak systolic gradient decreased from 42 +/- 14 to 14 +/- 15 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and mean diameter increased from 4.1 +/- 2.6 to 6.8 +/- 3.2 mm (p less than 0.01). There was no mortality or significant acute morbidity associated with the procedure. After 1 to 24 months of follow-up, restenosis has occurred in only 1 patient. Aneurysm formation was found in 2 of 5 patients who had undergone repeat catheterization; both aneurysms occurred in patients with repaired interruption of the aortic arch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each patient had previously undergone palliative surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. In 1 patient the angioplasty catheter was introduced into the ascending aorta during surgery to correct intracardiac defects. In the other 8 infants the catheters were inserted directly into the descending thoracic aorta via thoracotomy because the catheter size precluded percutaneous insertion into the femoral artery. In each case, after measuring the systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation, the angioplasty catheters were advanced over the guidewire across the coarctation site. The balloons were then inflated 2 to 3 times with an internal pressure of 3 to 6 atm. After the dilation sequence the angioplasty catheters were removed and the pressures were again measured above and below the coarctation. Preoperative gradients across the coarctation site ranged from 26 to 85 mm Hg (mean 45). Immediately after the procedure the gradient decreased in each case, ranging from 0 to 12 mm Hg (mean 4.3). There were no signs of disruption of the aortic wall. Relief of the pressure gradient persisted in the 7 patients who underwent follow-up cardiac catheterization after the procedure. The patients have been followed for as long as 18 months after the procedure and none has shown physical or echocardiographic evidence of recurrent aortic obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The morphologic characteristics of ventricular septal defect (VSD) and left ventricular outflow tract were studied in 45 hearts with VSD and coarctation of the aorta (C of A). Forty-one VSDs were classified into 1 of 4 categories. The first category includes 19 central muscular VSDs (43%), among which 3 hearts had the architecture of a spontaneously closed defect. The second category includes 10 perimembranous inlet defects (23%) with overlying tricuspid valve. The third category is formed by 8 perimembranous VSDs with leftward outlet septal malalignment (18%) and the fourth category includes 4 subarterial VSDs (8%) in which leftward malalignment of a deficient outlet septum results in subpulmonary localization of the defect. In addition to the main categories, 1 membranous, 1 perimembranous trabecular, 1 apical muscular and 1 doubly committed subarterial defects were identified. The left ventricular outflow tract was assessed as normal in only 2 cases. In 43 cases the left ventricular outflow tract was compromised by 1 or more of the following anomalies: anterolateral muscle bundle, anteroseptal twist, bicuspid aortic valve or a leftward malaligned outlet septum. These findings support the hypothesis of C of A being hemodynamically induced by anomalies of the left ventricular outflow tract. Previous studies have established that muscular, membranous and perimembranous inlet defects are prone to close spontaneously, in contrast to malalignment and subarterial VSDs. The present study shows that 70% of the VSDs belong to types characterized by a high incidence of spontaneous closure.\r"

  ".W": "In 16 of 177 patients with effusive acute idiopathic pericarditis (10 men, 6 women, mean age 38 years), features of cardiac constriction were detected (by physical examination in 6 patients and by noninvasive recordings in all) between 5 and 30 days after an echocardiogram had shown pericardial effusion, at a time when signs of activity had abated and effusion was already minimal or had altogether disappeared. Cardiac catheterization was performed in 5 patients, showing either overt (3 patients) or occult (2 patients) cardiac constriction. Two patients had clinical signs of cardiac failure. After a mean of 2.7 months, the features of constriction had spontaneously disappeared in all patients in the clinical examination and noninvasive recordings, and remained so in subsequent control studies (mean follow-up 31 months). Repeat cardiac catheterization in the 5 patients in whom it had been previously performed showed normal features both in the basal state and after fluid overload. The results of the present study show that some patients may go through a transient phase of cardiac constriction at the end of the effusive period of acute idiopathic pericarditis. Features of constriction are, in most cases, subtle and can go unrecognized if not specifically sought. However, they may have clinical relevance in some patients. These findings provide insight into the resolution phase of effusive acute idiopathic pericarditis, and an unnecessary pericardiectomy may be avoided.\r"

This study determines whether the magnitude of instantaneous velocity spread in the ascending aorta is related to ascending aortic diameter, Reynolds number or other factors. Ascending aortic velocity tracings and diameters were recorded for 77 normal subjects using a 25 degrees off-axis transducer that permitted beam-flow alignment. Percent instantaneous velocity spread at peak modal velocity, which corresponds temporally to initial deceleration, was determined by dividing instantaneous velocity spread by peak modal velocity. Using standard formulations, values were computed in the ascending aorta of each subject for Reynolds number using peak and mean velocity, Womersley's alpha, and critical oscillatory Reynolds number. The highest correlation occurred for percent instantaneous velocity spread and ascending aortic diameter (r = 0.54) (p less than 0.001). The second highest correlation occurred for percent instantaneous velocity spread and critical oscillatory Reynolds number (r = -0.47) (p less than 0.001). A low but significant correlation (r = 0.30) (p less than 0.05) was found between alpha and percent instantaneous velocity spread. No significant correlation was found between percent instantaneous velocity spread and heart rate (r = 0.23), Reynolds number (r = -0.11) or maximal ascending aortic velocity (r = 0.14). This study demonstrates that percent instantaneous velocity spread in the human aorta is most closely related to ascending aortic diameter, an increase of which will cause a higher percent instantaneous velocity spread at initial deceleration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diameter of mitral valve flow was measured in early and late diastole in the apical 4-chamber view. Transmitral velocities were measured in early and late diastole with pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The early flow diameter was significantly smaller in patients older than 50 than in those aged 20 to 29 years (p less than 0.05), while atrial flow diameter was significantly larger in patients older than 50 than in those aged 20 to 29 years (p less than 0.05). The ratio of early flow diameter to atrial flow diameter was 1.85 +/- 0.33 in patients 20 to 29 years old and 1.17 +/- 0.28 in those older than 50 (p less than 0.001). The ratio of early to atrial diastolic velocities was 1.98 +/- 0.53 in the younger patients and 1.07 +/- 0.41 in those older than 50 years (p less than 0.001). The ratio of early flow diameter to atrial flow diameter decreased significantly with aging, and this decrease had a negative correlation with aging (r = -0.64). Qualitatively, in these normal subjects, early diastolic flow filled the ventricle centrally, while with atrial contraction, flow entered the ventricle toward the posterolateral wall and was associated with flow moving toward the aortic valve along the ventricular septum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recordings were done independently by 2 experienced observers on the same day and repeated once after 1 to 21 days. Analysis of variance showed that no systematic differences were introduced by the 2 observers and Doppler approaches or by measuring on different days. The coefficient of variation between any pair of measurements in each patient was 9%. This variability is probably a result of the method or spontaneous fluctuations of the stroke volume and not of the varying recording conditions. The ultrasonic method detects day-to-day changes of cardiac stroke volume larger than 20% with a probability greater than 0.95.\r"

Because intakes of 0.4 micrograms X kg-1 X d-1 (0.89 nmol X kg-1 X d-1) and probably lower intakes maintain normal clotting activities in healthy neomycin-treated adults, rounded daily recommended dietary intakes (RDI) for essentially all reference 76-kg men and 62-kg women are 45 micrograms (100 nmol) and 35 micrograms (78 nmol) phylloquinone, respectively. Newborn infants are at high risk because breast milk contains inadequate concentrations of vitamin K and their intestines are not yet colonized with vitamin K-producing bacteria. Body reserves of vitamin K are small and turnover rapidly. Hence, supplementation of infants with vitamin K is highly advisable. Increments of vitamin K during pregnancy and lactation are also suggested.\r"

To maintain a suitable body pool in healthy 76-kg men and 62-kg women requires daily intakes (RDI) of 40 mg (227 mumol) and 30 mg (170 mumol), respectively. Reasons for not increasing RDI values to enhance iron absorption and to prevent nitrosamine formation are given. The specific association of normal intakes of dietary vitamin C with cancer is very weak and not quantifiable. Advisable intakes for children, pregnant and lactating women, and the elderly are considered. The present recommendations are in better accord with current information than are the 1980 RDA values.\r"

In this paper a satisfactory vitamin A status is defined as a total-body pool that provides adequate vitamin A to meet all known physiological needs and a reserve for 4 mo on low intakes or during stress. Mean dietary intakes required to maintain an adequate body pool (ie, 20 micrograms vitamin A/g liver [0.07 mumol/g]) in reference 76-kg men and 62-kg women are 506 and 413 micrograms retinol, respectively. Recommended dietary intakes (RDI) for nearly all reference men and women are 700 micrograms and 600 micrograms, respectively. Vitamin A needs in infants, children, the elderly, and pregnant and lactating women are quantified. The toxicity of vitamin A in early pregnancy, for which a safe intake level is not known, is stressed. On many grounds these suggested lower RDI values are preferable to the 1980 RDA values.\r"

By hydrostatic weighing, mean (+/- SD) body density was 1.01 g/mL (+/- 0.02) and percentage body fat, 41.7% (+/- 7.8). The best predictors of body density were the thigh and biceps sites with ultrasound (r = 0.820) and the triceps site with the calipers (r = 0.633). Further, ultrasound proved to be superior to the caliper technique in measuring subcutaneous fat of obese persons.\r"

Plasma free cystine, homocystine, cysteine-homocysteine-mixed disulfide (MDS), methionine, and taurine and protein-bound cysteine and homocysteine were measured. In nonfasted patients, plasma homocystine and MDS were not measured. Fasted patients predialysis had elevated plasma free cystine, homocystine, MDS, methionine, and taurine; all of these, except taurine, fell during dialysis. In nonfasted patients, plasma free cystine was elevated. Protein-bound cysteine and homocysteine were elevated predialysis and postdialysis in all patients; protein-bound cysteine fell during dialysis but remained above normal. In MHD patients predialysis, plasma free cystine levels correlated with plasma MDS, protein-bound cysteine, and age. These findings indicate pervasive alterations in plasma sulfur amino acid levels in MHD patients.\r"

After ingestion of 25 g xylitol, gastric emptying was markedly prolonged (T-1/2 58 +/- 5 min control vs 91 +/- 7 min after xylitol [p less than 0.01]). Since delayed gastric emptying may affect food intake, we evaluated the effects of xylitol on calorie intake. Food intake after oral preloading with water resulted in intake of 920 +/- 60 kcal vs 690 +/- 45 kcal after 25 g of xylitol. In contrast, a preload of glucose, fructose, or sucrose failed to suppress food intake. Although xylitol decreased food intake and also delayed gastric emptying, these effects may be unrelated. Our data suggest a role for xylitol as a potentially important agent in dietary control.\r"

Lactose malabsorption was diagnosed with standard oral lactose tolerance test and blood glucose determinations. Lactose malabsorbers showed symptoms more frequently than absorbers after the test load of lactose (p less than 0.01) they also reported milk intolerance more frequently (p less than 0.01). Prevalence of lactose malabsorption is significantly lower in the central sample (19%) than in the northern (52%) and southern (41%) samples (p less than 0.01). This finding contrasts with the hypothesis of a continuous increase in frequency of lactose malabsorption from northern to southern Europe and is probably due to the complex genetic history of the Italian population.\r"

The prevalence of mild xerophthalmia is higher in males than females (p = 0.03) and the difference cannot be explained by ecological factors. Nutritional status, length of weaning, severe diseases, and intake of food with low-vitamin A content are factors associated with vitamin A deficiency. Length of weaning and severe diseases play a more important role than nutritional status in this study. The prevalence of diarrhea and respiratory diseases was twice as high in children with xerophthalmia than in children without (p less than 0.001 and less than 0.02, respectively).

Associations between PDM and TM were highly significant (p less than 0.001). Correlation coefficients were 0.90454 for hemoglobin and 0.9266 for hematocrit and there were no significant differences between mean values obtained by both procedures. Hemoglobin levels in discs remained unchanged during a storage for 1 mo. Hematocrit values, however, were constant throughout a 6-mo evaluation. On average, the percent coefficients of variation were 3.4 and 8.3% for determinations of hemoglobin and hematocrit, respectively. It is concluded that PDM represents a practical alternative approach for assessing hematological status in the field.\r"

A retrospective survey of the records from pediatric echocardiographic laboratories and pediatric cardiologists at teaching hospitals, as well as a random sample survey of nonteaching hospitals with pediatric beds in the metropolitan area, was carried out. A total of 190 cases were identified, yielding an annual mean minimum incidence of 5.95 per 100,000 children less than 5 years old. Cases occurred endemically with superimposed spring clusters in 1980 and 1983. As seen in other studies, the male-female ratio was 1.58:1, and the peak incidence occurred in children between 1 and 2 years old, with 85% of cases occurring in children under 5 years of age. The racial distribution of cases was as follows: whites, including Hispanics, 62%; blacks, 32%; Asians, 5%; and half-white/half-Asian, 1%. Asians were slightly overrepresented in that they made up only 1.7% of the study area population. The annual minimum incidence for Asian Americans was 24.4 per 100,000 children less than 5 years old; this rate was significantly greater than those for the other racial groups. Although few cases were observed in Japanese-American children, the calculated annual minimum incidence in this small group was approximately 44 per 100,000 children less than 5 years old. The highest incidence was observed in several suburban Chicago zip code areas, where annual rates as high as 84.7 per 100,000 children less than 5 years old were documented. Coronary artery abnormalities were diagnosed by echocardiography in 30 (16%) of 190 cases; the male-female ratio of patients with such abnormalities was 2.75:1. Whites and children under 1 year of age demonstrated the highest incidence of coronary artery abnormalities. White children under 1 year of age appeared to be at particularly high risk for development of coronary abnormalities, with 11 (41%) of 27 white infants manifesting such findings by echocardiography. These infants may represent a subgroup of patients who would benefit particularly from therapy with intravenous gamma globulin for prevention of coronary abnormalities and who require particularly close follow-up care.\r"

The results indicated that parents were twice as likely to attribute competence to the physician wearing formal dress compared with the physician wearing an operating room outfit and four times more likely compared with the physician wearing an intern uniform. The likelihood of making assumptions of competence was significantly reduced in parents with a university education and in parents who had never previously had a child hospitalized. The gender of the physician had no effect on perceptions of competence.\r"

To our knowledge, no study has compared these three tests and jejunal biopsy results. A retrospective survey of all jejunal biopsy results at Children's Hospital, Boston, from July 1983 to July 1984 was undertaken to evaluate which test best predicted a normal biopsy result. None of the screening tests was ideal. The lactose breath test had low sensitivity and specificity and did not correlate significantly with biopsy results. The D-xylose and fecal fat tests were each significantly correlated with biopsy results; a normal result of either test was highly predictive of a normal biopsy result. Combining the results of two or more screening tests did not improve predictive value. The xylose test is preferable on the basis of greater sensitivity and ease of patient compliance.\r"

Half of the 49 patients in whom the diagnosis was based on positive cerebrospinal fluid culture benefited directly from viral culture results by early withdrawal of antibiotics, early discharge, or changing of the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. Enteroviral cultures became positive in as early as 24 hours, and most of the cultures became positive within one week. The cost of viral culture is comparable with that of other microbiologic tests. The virology laboratory has proved useful in the diagnosis and management of patients with enteroviral meningitis.\r"

The test procedure involves placing a gastric pinch biopsy into a small amount of a solution containing urea and a pH indicator in the well of a microtiter tray. The method depends on the ability of C. pyloridis to hydrolyse urea and release an alkaline product (ammonia). The \"microtiter biopsy urease test\" is 100% specific for C. pyloridis and has a 91% sensitivity after 18 h reaction time. Seventy-five percent of positive biopsies had a reaction time of less than 1 h. The test may be used to predict the presence of antral gastritis; as well as marking the presence of the bacterium; with a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative predictive value of 73%. There was a positive correlation between the biopsy urease test results and the grades of both chronic and active antral gastritis. This test is simple and can be performed in the endoscopy clinic as the formulation of the reagent obviates the need for aseptic techniques.\r"

In all patients where a comprehensive search of the stomach was conducted, C. pyloridis and active chronic gastritis were associated. That is, the presence of this organism anywhere in the stomach may be taken as a marker of active chronic gastritis within that stomach, although not necessarily at the site of bacterial detection. Two main patterns of colonization are proposed: C. pyloridis either colonizes normal antra and extends proximally along the lesser curvature and into the body with subsequent development of active chronic gastritis and/or the bacterium colonizes areas of chronic-only gastritis induced by other agents resulting in active chronic gastritis. As C. pyloridis may be limited to the antrum or body of any given stomach, it is necessary to biopsy both areas when looking for the bacterium.\r"

Ten patients had pain for more than 1 yr. Three patients presented with painless vomiting. The antrum was involved in 27 patients and the body in 17 patients. There was no correlation between the number of erosions and the duration of symptoms. Double contrast barium meal was positive in nine of 21 patients. Of 19 patients treated with cimetidine, 15 improved clinically and six of eight had endoscopic improvement. The treatment of choice is unknown and controlled trials are needed.

Contraction amplitude, wave duration, velocity, and propagation time were increased after metoclopramide. These changes were more pronounced in the distal esophagus. At the most distal manometric recording level located 2 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter, contraction amplitude increased 39% (p less than 0.01) and duration increased 22.5% (p less than 0.01) after metoclopramide. We conclude that in normal subjects metoclopramide has an effect predominant in the distal body of the esophagus.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly in which the ventral and dorsal pancreas drain separately into the duodenum. It is the most common congenital variant of pancreatic ductal fusion and drainage anomalies. With widespread use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, pancreas divisum is being detected with increasing frequency. Ten cases of pancreas divisum detected among 500 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examinations performed between 1979 and 1985 at our institution were critically analyzed. Patients with symptomatic pancreas divisum (group 1) were typically young (mean age 29 yr), usually female, and had no history of significant alcohol abuse. Those with incidental detection of pancreas divisum (group 2) were older (mean age 62 yr), usually male with hepatobiliary disease, and had a history of significant alcohol ingestion. The radiological feature of pancreas divisum is characterized by a short (1-6 cm) and thin (2 mm diameter) pancreatic duct (duct of Wirsung) that branches off into regular arborization and drains only the posterior part of the head of the pancreas. This appearance is quite typical; however, this may be simulated by other conditions such as previous pancreatic trauma, partial pancreatectomy, or pancreatitis with irreversible damage to the duct, pseudocyst, and pancreatic carcinoma. The differentiation between true and false pancreas divisum is important because of its clinical implications.\r"

  ".W": "Peptide YY has been localized within human ileocolonic endocrine cells and may contribute to the regulation of gastric secretion and gastric emptying in man. Since our previous studies had shown decreased colonic concentrations of peptide YY in the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, a specific radioimmunoassay was used to measure fasting serum concentrations of peptide YY in healthy controls and in patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum, idiopathic chronic active liver disease and hepatic cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. In healthy controls and in patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum, serum concentrations of peptide YY ranged from 50 to 260 pg/ml. Serum concentrations of peptide YY in patients with hepatic cirrhosis ranged from 59 to 717 pg/ml. Serum concentrations of peptide YY in patients with ulcerative colitis were similar to healthy controls. In patients with Crohn's disease, serum concentrations of peptide YY were less than 50 pg/ml in three patients who had had a previous proctocolectomy, and were more than 260 pg/ml in 14 patients who had had previous resection of more than 48 cm of ileum or presently had symptomatic Crohn's disease subsequently requiring surgical resection of a total of more than 75 cm of ileum. These results suggest that most circulating peptide YY is released from the colorectal region. Hepatic cirrhosis, previous ileal resection, and symptomatic Crohn's disease were associated with elevation of fasting serum peptide YY. The mechanism of increased fasting serum peptide YY in patients with Crohn's disease could be the loss of an ileal inhibitory factor or possibly an increased release of colonic peptide YY in response to fat malabsorption. The effect of alteration of serum peptide YY concentrations on the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease is yet unknown.\r"

Although this investigation was conducted with the subjects living at home and selecting their own diet, metabolic balance techniques were carefully observed. The diet was identical in the 3-day control and 3-day experimental period except for the alteration of one aspect of the diet in the experimental period. The substances tested were those often either interdicted for or avoided by ileostomates. Only seven (five fruits, one vegetable, and prune juice) of the 37 dietary substances significantly increased the ileal effluent. Excessive water intake, alcohol beverages, fried foods, and spices did not increase ileostomy output. A small but significant loss of sodium and in some instances potassium was observed with prune juice and some fruits that statistically increased ileal output. Although a limited number of foods were studied, application of the results suggests that many dietary substances generally avoided by or interdicted for ileostomates did not significantly increase the amount of ileal excreta when objective measurements are made.\r"

Both laxatives increased defecation frequency and wet and dry stool weights although the added effect of the senna was clearly evident. Only the psyllium with senna increased stool moisture. Two distinct responses to the psyllium plus senna were evident; the subpopulation of high responders (n = 7) was responsible for most of the increase in stool frequency and dry weight in this group, and laxation in the subpopulation of normal responders (n = 12) was similar to that observed in those receiving psyllium alone. Both laxatives provided a similarly high degree of subjective relief and improvement in stool consistency. When constipation was assessed objectively by stool frequency and weight, laxation was attained by 63% of the psyllium plus senna group and 48% of the psyllium group.\r"

To evaluate the location of reabsorption, we repeated these measurements after replacing ascites in the subdiaphragmatic region with 500-1000 ml of intraperitoneally injected air, reasoning that this maneuver should slow or eliminate ascites reabsorption occurring at this site. We found that the transfer rates of albumin and red cells out of ascites were similar and that creation of pneumoperitoneum did not influence these rates. These data confirm that ascites protein reabsorption occurs via a lymphatic mechanism in man. They suggest, however, that these vessels may not be subdiaphragmatic in location.\r"

Altogether, 14 phenotypes have been observed in the present investigation, compared with six phenotypes described in earlier studies. It appears that placental GDH is controlled by five codominant autosomal alleles producing 15 possible phenotypes. The gene frequencies of GDH1, GDH2, and GDH3 in these ethnic groups are significantly different from those reported in Caucasians. There were slight differences in the gene frequencies between the three ethnic groups, with those of Indians being nearer to the frequency in Caucasians.

The results indicate that for each of these enzymes an arbitrary cutoff point could be chosen that would enable one to correctly predict the outcome for the majority of at-risk pregnancies. However, some false positives and false negatives occurred with each enzyme. To obtain optimal diagnostic discrimination, the three enzyme values obtained for each sample were combined into a single linear discriminant function that proved to be a more accurate indicator of the outcome of the pregnancy. This was especially important for those cases in which the predicted outcome as based on the individual enzyme results was in disagreement. From the cases studied here, it appears that this method can be expected to give a correct prediction in approximately 96.5% of all 25%-at-risk pregnancies. False positives can be expected in approximately 1.4% of the pregnancies and false negatives in approximately 2.2%.\r"

Contrary to the hypothesis, these studies appear to indicate that the ratio of maternal to paternal errors does not depend significantly on maternal age.

In order to calculate likelihoods, it is necessary to have predictive formulas for multiple recombination frequencies. In the present study the Markovian assumption of Morton and MacLean is generalized to give predictive formulas for multiple-region recombination using realistic map functions. The best-fitting map functions have been determined by fitting the nine-locus data of Morgan et al. and the seven-locus data of Weinstein on the Drosophila X chromosome. Two map functions fit the data better than other published functions: that of Rao et al. with a map parameter of P = .33 and a new function suggested in the present paper. The close agreement of the estimate of the mapping parameter with a previous estimate inferred from human male meiosis suggests that the map function is robust. A further improvement in the fit to the data can be obtained by the addition of a second parameter to reduce the expected number of multiple recombinants. By comparison with the map functions recommended in the present paper, the assumption of no interference gives a poor fit to the data.\r"

Hypomagnesemia has been identified in 42 percent of patients with hypokalemia, and below normal muscle magnesium levels have been found in 43 percent of congestive heart failure patients receiving diuretics. Magnesium is important for maintenance of cell potassium, and infusions of magnesium alone have increased muscle potassium and magnesium levels and significantly decreased the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats. It has been shown that both potassium and magnesium are conserved by potassium-sparing agents. Because serum and tissue magnesium levels are not correlated and correlations for potassium levels are weak, prevention of these electrolyte abnormalities is advised.\r"

Arrhythmias may develop in hypokalemia due to enhanced normal automaticity, abnormal automaticity, or slowed conduction; moreover, hypokalemia is associated with enhanced digitalis toxicity, quinidine-related Torsades de pointes, and interference with the antiarrhythmic activity of quinidine. Hypomagnesemia, especially in the presence of other electrolyte abnormalities, also affects automaticity and is associated with decreased efficacy of digitalis and with quinidine-related Torsades de pointes. Therefore, treatment that controls hypertension without causing electrolyte abnormalities is preferable for patients who are at risk of arrhythmias, or who are receiving drugs such as digitalis or quinidine.\r"

Patients with cardiovascular disease who are at greatest risk for the development of magnesium deficiency are those treated with diuretics or digitalis. Both potassium and magnesium deficiencies are associated with increased ventricular ectopy and may increase the risk of sudden unexpected death. Refractory potassium repletion can be caused by concomitant magnesium depletion, and can be corrected with magnesium supplementation. Routine serum magnesium determination is recommended whenever the testing of electrolyte levels is required, especially in patients taking diuretic drugs or digitalis. Because hypomagnesemia is not necessarily present in a magnesium-deficient state, it is recommended that both potassium and magnesium be repleted in patients with hypokalemia. Potassium-/magnesium-sparing diuretics may be helpful in the prevention of these electrolyte deficiencies.\r"

Data suggest that serum potassium and magnesium levels may be normal in the presence of tissue depletion, but decreases in serum levels are almost always associated with tissue and whole-body depletion of these electrolytes in patients in whom such depletion cannot be risked. Ventricular ectopy has also been associated with depletion of potassium and magnesium, which may explain the increased risk of sudden unexpected death in hypertensive patients. Any clinician who treats hypertension or congestive heart failure must consider whether to replete potassium and magnesium in patients already receiving diuretic therapy, or, better still, consider how to prevent depletion of these electrolytes in patients in whom such depletion cannot be risked. If prevention is selected, the clinician must then evaluate the data on available diuretic combinations for efficacy in electrolyte conservation, bioavailability, and dosage convenience. The combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide (Maxzide, 75 mg triamterene/50 mg hydrochlorothiazide) has demonstrated electrolyte conservation, with bioavailability and dosage convenience.\r"

  ".U": "87181730\r", 
  ".W": "Congestive heart failure is the most important predisposing factor to the occurrence of sudden death in patients with cardiovascular disease. As left ventricular dysfunction deteriorates and symptoms of heart failure become evident, ambulatory ventricular arrhythmias become increasingly frequent and complex, and sudden cardiac death becomes an increasingly common occurrence. When the left ventricular ejection fraction has declined to less than 30 percent and symptoms of heart failure become refractory to treatment with digitalis and diuretics, 35 to 50 percent of patients will die of a lethal cardiac arrhythmia within three years. A number of factors interact to determine the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure. Myocardial fibrosis and enhanced left ventricular wall stress may alter the electrophysiologic properties of the myocardium, but these factors may not be sufficient to explain the development of lethal rhythm disturbances. Neurohormonal activation may exacerbate the frequency and complexity of ambulatory arrhythmias in these patients, but such activation can persist for long periods without fatal electrophysiologic sequelae. Recent investigations suggest that electrolyte depletion may provide an important immediate precipitating cause for the occurrence of fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the patient with severe left ventricular dysfunction whose susceptibility is markedly heightened by preexisting structural, hemodynamic, or neurohormonal factors. Further work is needed to determine if prophylactic therapy directed at preventing electrolyte depletion can favorably modify the long-term outcome of these severely ill patients.\r"

Sixty-three cases of native valve endocarditis diagnosed in Memphis hospitals between 1980 and 1984 were reviewed. All diagnoses of underlying cardiac lesions were confirmed by two-dimensional echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and/or histopathologic examination of valve tissues. Major categories of underlying lesions were as follows: mitral valve prolapse, 29 percent; no underlying disease, 27 percent; degenerative lesions of the aortic or mitral valve, 21 percent; congenital heart disease, 13 percent; rheumatic heart disease, 6 percent. Thus, mitral valve prolapse and, in the elderly, degenerative lesions have displaced rheumatic and congenital heart diseases as the major conditions underlying endocarditis. Redundancy of the mitral valve leaflets was noted in 17 of 18 patients in whom endocarditis was superimposed upon mitral valve prolapse. The risk of infective endocarditis appears to be substantially increased in the subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse who exhibit valvular redundancy.\r"

However, patient discomfort, the difficulty of accurately interpreting cardiac signals against a background of electrical noise, and the complexity of use have limited widespread application. In this study, esophageal electrocardiography was used in 48 acutely ill patients with a new \"pill electrode\" system, consisting of a bipolar electrode pair (3 by 20 mm) attached to 0.5 mm diameter Teflon wires contained in a standard gelatin capsule. The capsule with enclosed electrodes was voluntarily swallowed, and the recording electrodes were positioned posterior to the left atrium. A preamplifier system with a low-frequency filter and a standard three-channel electrocardiographic recorder were used. Esophageal \"pill\" electrocardiographic recordings were made in 48 of 50 eligible study patients (96 percent) with tachyarrhythmias and absent or equivocal atrial activity on surface electrocardiography. In these patients, a high-quality esophageal electrocardiographic recording was obtained within one to 10 minutes with minimal patient discomfort. In 25 of 48 study patients (52 percent), the original diagnosis, based on the surface electrocardiographic recording, was incorrect after review of the esophageal recording. Results of esophageal recording altered management in 19 of 48 (40 percent) patients. This new and simple technique facilitates diagnosis and management of perplexing tachyarrhythmias in acutely ill patients by physicians with minimal training in the technique.\r"

The most frequent organisms causing 273 episodes in 239 non-neutropenic patients were Escherichia coli (20 percent), Staphylococcus aureus (13 percent), polymicrobic (12 percent), Pseudomonas species (8 percent), Klebsiella species (7 percent), Candida species (7 percent), Bacteroides species (6 percent), Enterobacter species (4 percent), and Clostridium species (4 percent). The overall mortality was 31 percent (21 percent with adequate therapy; 50 percent with inadequate therapy). The most frequent organisms causing 158 episodes in 117 neutropenic patients were polymicrobic (21 percent), E. coli (16 percent), Klebsiella species (15 percent), Pseudomonas species (8 percent), Candida species (6 percent), S. aureus (6 percent), Streptococcus faecalis (5 percent), S. epidermidis (4 percent), and Corynebacterium CDC-JK (3 percent). The overall mortality was 52 percent (36 percent with adequate therapy; 88 percent with inadequate therapy). Since a review a decade ago, the spectrum of organisms changed in that the gram-positive organisms, S. faecalis, S. epidermidis, and C. CDC-JK, emerged as important pathogens. Neutropenic patients had a high incidence (42 percent) of septicemia due to multiple organisms, occurring concurrently or sequentially. The overall mortality of these patients was exceptionally high (80 percent). In contrast, the overall mortality of neutropenic patients with single-organism septicemia was comparable to that of non-neutropenic patients with single-organism septicemia (37 percent versus 29 percent).\r"

  ".W": "In a study of 16 different families, 55 persons were considered to be affected by the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). Serum calcium measurements were available for all but six patients, long deceased, and hypercalcemia was invariably present. All but four of these patients have been subjected to surgery, and hyperparathyroidism was verified in each case. In all the patients studied, hyperparathyroidism was apparently the first manifestation of the MEN-1 syndrome. Pituitary tumors were detected in 23 patients, and there was evidence of pancreatic lesions in 32. Although either the pituitary or pancreatic manifestations dominated clinically in some patients, hyperparathyroidism was invariably present when sought. Measurement of serum calcium in asymptomatic relatives at risk for MEN-1 disclosed no case of hyperparathyroidism in children below the age of 18, whereas half of all screened persons between the ages of 18 and 30 were found to have hyperparathyroidism. In some, the serum calcium values were only marginally or even intermittently elevated. It is concluded that since hyperparathyroidism is apparently the first lesion in MEN-1, screening for this syndrome should primarily be directed toward the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. The temporal relationships suggest that hyperparathyroidism could be a prerequisite for the other types of endocrine neoplasms in the MEN-1 syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Although calcitonin is a natural, nontoxic, and rapid inhibitor of bone resorption, its use in the treatment of hypercalcemia is limited because of its transient efficacy and the need for repeated parenteral administration. In normal subjects, suppositories of calcitonin have been shown to be biologically active. Peak plasma concentrations of salmon calcitonin after rectal administration in six normal subjects were similar to those measured after parenteral administration. To evaluate the efficacy of calcitonin suppositories in disease states, 10 patients with moderate hypercalcemia due to malignancy were treated with salmon calcitonin, administered as suppositories containing 300 MRC units, three times a day for seven days. The mean plasma calcium level decreased significantly from 2.96 +/- 0.09 mmol/liter to 2.57 +/- 0.09 after one week (p less than 0.005) and rose again after discontinuation of treatment to 2.86 +/- 0.09 mmol/liter one week later. Urinary calcium and hydroxyproline values decreased during treatment and rose after discontinuation of treatment. The plasma calcium level decreased rapidly in six patients, becoming normal in five; three patients showed only a partial response, and one patient had no response at all. No side effects were observed, and clinical improvement was noted in nine of the 10 patients. Little or no response was observed in patients with extremely high urinary calcium or, to a lesser extent, high hydroxyproline excretion. There was a significant negative correlation between the maximal decrease in plasma calcium concentration and initial urinary calcium excretion (r -0.78, p less than 0.01). Thus, salmon calcitonin administered by the rectal route appears to be an easy, safe, and effective treatment of moderate hypercalcemia without apparent side effects.\r"

The unique histopathologic features of the latter are presented. The onset of acute cutaneous disease in this patient coincided with worsening renal disease and preceded a flare of disease activity in other sites after a 14-year period of quiescence. The severe and unremitting pain from the skin lesions and their tendency to form nonhealing ulcers were substantial causes of morbidity in this patient with familial Mediterranean fever.\r"

In most previous reports of alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome, detailed endocrinologic data supporting a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome have been lacking. This report describes a patient with clinical features of Cushing's syndrome, increased plasma ACTH values, and elevated levels of basal urinary free cortisol and 17-hydroxysteroids that were not suppressed by low-dose dexamethasone but were suppressed by high-dose dexamethasone. Detailed test results were indistinguishable from those in Cushing's disease, which had been the initial diagnosis. When an occult history of alcohol abuse was discovered, the suspicion of alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome was raised. During an extended hospitalization and abstinence from alcohol, abnormal endocrinologic test results gradually became normal. This patient also demonstrated a further complicating feature, a left adrenal mass, which appeared to be a benign, coincidental lesion. Because of the high prevalence of alcohol abuse and the possibility that test results may be identical to those in Cushing's disease, clinicians should be familiar with this disorder to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy.\r"

The infusion produced marked but transient elevations of maternal concentrations of serum IgG and quantities of monocyte surface IgG, but no significant changes in Fc receptor-mediated rosetting of peripheral blood monocytes with antibody-sensitized platelets occurred. Modest increases in quantities of platelets and plasma platelet-specific IgG were demonstrated. The infant, delivered by cesarean section 2 days after the end of the infusion, had a normal platelet count; cord blood had a normal concentration of serum IgG, but an elevated quantity of platelet surface IgG (by comparison with values for normal adults). Infant values of plasma platelet-specific IgG, monocyte surface IgG, and monocyte/platelet rosettes also were within the range of normal for adults. Anticytomegalovirus antibody was present in large amounts in the gamma globulin infused, first appeared in maternal serum after therapy, and was detected in cord serum.

This study showed equivalent efficacy of native IVIG as compared with reduced and alkylated IVIG during maintenance therapy for hypogammaglobulinemia.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical value of a scaled-down prototype of an extracorporeal plasma ultrafiltration system for the treatment of acute serum sickness in rabbits was examined. The system uses two filters: the primary separates red cells from plasma, and the secondary filter excludes high molecular weight proteins from plasma. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the secondary filters rejected substantially more IgM (80-90%) than IgG (10-30%) or albumin (10%) and totally rejected immune complexes (IC) prepared in vitro. Two groups of rabbits were submitted to either sham filtration with the primary filter only (n = 5), receiving back the remixed components of their blood, or to the complete ultrafiltration protocol (n = 7), with removal of high molecular weight proteins and IC. Several parameters were studied longitudinally, such as circulating IC, which appeared to rise more slowly in animals whose blood was ultrafiltered, and total proteinuria, which appeared to remain at lower levels in the same animals. Histologic examination of the kidneys, collected after killing, showed evidence of glomerular IC deposition in three of five sham-treated animals (a similar frequency to that observed in a separate group of five rabbits with acute serum sickness), while one of six treated animals had evidence of glomerular deposition of IC. These observations are tentative because of the small number of animals in each group, but are encouraging. Further studies with larger groups of animals are needed to determine whether the observed effects are reproducible and to better characterize the factors directly related to the removal of circulating IC.\r"

These people may have a pathologic process: anemia of senescence. Erythroid cells mature from nonlymphoid mononuclear cells; the maturation process is modulated by lymphokines. When assessed as end products of the humoral or cellular immune system, mononuclear cell function declines with host age. This study tests the hypothesis that mononuclear cell support of erythroid burst formation is defective in elderly subjects. Leukocyte-conditioned medium was prepared from each of five young and five elderly adults. Erythroid bursts from young or elderly adults were grown in culture medium containing leukocyte-conditioned medium from at least three young adults and at least three elderly adults. Erythroid bursts from either young or elderly adults were 1.4-3.0 times more numerous if the leukocyte-conditioned medium derived from a young rather than elderly adult. In addition, when culture medium contained leukocyte-conditioned medium from young adults, only half the elderly adults studied had erythroid bursts equal to those of young adults. These data support the hypothesis that mononuclear cell support of erythropoiesis in the elderly is defective.\r"

Therefore, management of this serious disorder varies and depends on the underlying cause. Pursuit of a histologic diagnosis with invasive procedures has been associated with a wide range of diagnostic yields and complications. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy has been shown to be highly reliable and well tolerated in the diagnosis of a variety of mediastinal and lung masses. Three patients are presented with obstruction of the superior vena cava in whom computed tomography safely guided percutaneous needle biopsy in obtaining a correct histologic diagnosis. It appears that transthoracic percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy is safe and efficacious in patients with superior vena cava syndrome, but further experience with this increasingly available procedure is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was used to analyze the serum MM-CK isoenzyme subtypes in 16 patients receiving streptokinase (SK) for attempted coronary thrombolysis early after acute myocardial infarction. Twelve patients had revascularization documented by serial coronary angiograms (Group I); in four patients, angiography documented no such reperfusion (Group II). The data also were compared with a previously reported group of 8 patients who did not receive streptokinase (Group III). Total and MB-CK activity, as well as the MM-CK isoenzyme subtypes MM3-CK, MM2-CK, and MM1-CK tended to rise earlier and peak earlier in Group I compared with Group II; serum MM3-CK, the predominant subtype in myocardium, however, definitely peaked earlier in Group I (8.65 +/- 2.07 hr) compared with Group II (18.50 +/- 6.67 hr) (p less than 0.001). Soon after its release from myocardium, MM3-CK is converted in the serum to MM2-CK and eventually to MM1-CK; thus, the MM3-CK:MM1-CK ratio amplifies the time course of subtype conversion. The MM3-CK:MM1-CK activity ratio peaked earlier in Group I (5.51 +/- 0.97 H) compared to Group II (10.74 +/- 3.28 hr) (p less than 0.01), and peaked even earlier than MM3-CK (p less than 0.007) in both Groups I and II. Thus, the time course of the MM3-CK:MM1-CK ratio separates those patients who reperfuse when early SK is used after acute myocardial infarction from those who do not, and does it significantly earlier than the other enzymatic parameters of cellular necrosis, total CK, and MB-CK.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to determine whether noninvasive cardiac testing could be used to assess cardiac risk in patients undergoing surgery for vascular disease, the authors studied 96 patients. Seventy-seven patients eventually underwent major vascular surgery with 11 (14%) experiencing a significant cardiac complication. Thallium imaging was much more likely to be positive (p less than 0.01) in patients with a cardiac complication; however, there was a significant number of patients with cardiac complications who had a positive history or electrocardiogram for myocardial infarction. When grouped by complication and history of infarction, thallium imaging, if negative, correctly predicted low cardiac risk in the group with a history of infarction. Thallium imaging, however, did not provide a clear separation of risk in those without a history of infarction. Age and coronary angiography, on the other hand, did reveal significant differences within the group without a history of infarction. The resting radionuclide ejection fraction followed a similar pattern to thallium imaging. It is concluded that a positive history of myocardial infarction at any time in the past is the strongest risk predictor in this population and that the predictive value of noninvasive testing is dependent on this factor. Considering these findings, a proposed scheme for assessing risk that will require further validation is presented.\r"

Cardiac volumes, ejection fraction, and PSP/ESV ratio were computed using standard methods, and follow-up was performed using annual questionnaires. PSP/ESV ratio values were not significantly different (p = .09) between those who died during hospitalization (n = 101) after coronary surgery and those who were discharged. Long-term follow-up in surgically treated patients demonstrated a 97% 3-year and 93% 5-year survival for those with PSP/ESV over 2.292. These were significantly greater (p = .0026) in value in patients with PSP/ESV less than 1.237 (3-year and 5-year survival of 92 and 79.2%, respectively). In the medical group, survival rate for those with PSP/ESV over 2.292 at 5 years was 89.3%, while for those with PSP/ESV less than 1.237 it was 52.5% (p less than .001). Multivariate analysis, however, showed ejection fraction to be a more significant predictor of survival in both the groups compared with PSP/ESV ratio. Thus, PSP/ESV ratio does predict long-term survival in coronary disease patients treated either surgically or medically. Ejection fraction was nevertheless a more powerful predictor of outcome.\r"

Seven patients were selected for localized scotomas without diffuse depression of the differential light sensitivity (mean defect less than or equal to 3.0 decibels, loss variance greater than or equal to 20.0 decibels). Patients with diffuse depression manifested intraocular pressures that were higher (mean peak pressure +/- S.E.M., 27.6 +/- 1.2 mm Hg) than those with localized defects (22.4 +/- 1.4 mm Hg). The optic disk rim area of the localized loss group (mean +/- S.E.M., 1.02 +/- 0.15 mm2) was significantly smaller (P less than .05) than the disk rim area of the diffuse loss group (1.33 +/- 0.07 mm2). This difference was largely because of thinner temporal disk rims in the localized loss group. Different patterns of visual field loss may be caused by different mechanisms of glaucomatous optic nerve damage.\r"

Eyes with a better prognosis, such as those with anterior segment injuries alone and intraocular foreign bodies, were excluded. Of 50 eyes, 31 (62%) had a successful outcome. There was a significant difference in visual outcome between those eyes that had received blunt and sharp penetrating trauma. Visual acuity of 20/50 or better was more frequently attained in eyes with sharp penetrating trauma (P = .002). Thirty-three eyes had initial retinal detachment; 17 (52%) were successfully repaired. Blunt penetrating trauma produced retinal detachment more frequently than sharp penetrating trauma (22 of 29 vs 11 of 21). Retinal detachment was more often successfully repaired after sharp penetrating trauma (8 of 11 vs 9 of 22). Contusive damage to the choroid and retina limited final visual and anatomic results after blunt rupture of the globe.\r"

This autosomal recessive syndrome is characterized by hypoparathyroidism, Addison's disease, and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis among other endocrinopathies and immune disorders. We retrospectively reviewed 16 patients, 14 with the full syndrome and two with the syndrome partially manifested. Four of these patients manifested a self-limited, bilateral keratitis in which the age of onset ranged from 2 to 9 years. Keratitis preceded the onset of any endocrinopathy in two of four patients and was among the first signs of the syndrome. The keratitis was not caused by hypoparathyroidism or candidiasis. The anterior stromal vascularization and scarring resulted in a visual acuity of 20/50 or worse in four of eight affected eyes. We recommend medical management of the corneal disease without surgical intervention.\r"

Disease development was strikingly slowed in mice fed a diet containing quantities of omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil, FO). By 10 months of age, 94% of the FO mice were still living, whereas all the mice fed a saturated fat diet (lard,L) were dead. Those mice fed a corn oil (CO) diet were intermediate with 35% alive at the 10-month time evaluation. Long after the L and CO groups had succumbed to glomerulonephritis, the FO group had negligible proteinuria. Both B and T cell function, particularly antibody production and resultant circulating immune complex (CIC) levels, were modified by the type of dietary fat. FO mice exhibited lower levels of anti-ds-DNA and lower levels of CICs than L or CO mice. B/W antibody response to a T-independent antigen (DNP-dextran) was enhanced at 8 months of age in FO mice, whereas it was suppressed in L mice. T-dependent (sheep red blood cell) responses at that time period were reduced in all the diet groups, a reflection of the reduced numbers of accessory T cells as determined by FACS analysis. The natural killer (NK) response to YAC-1 cells decreased in the L group from 5 to 9 months of age but remained unchanged in the CO and FO groups. Severe glomerulonephritis was the most common histopathologic finding in the L and CO groups. Arteritis was found in the spleens of nearly all the L and CO mice. Arteritis of the heart, colon and intestine, stomach, kidney, and liver were also seen principally in the L mice. In contrast, most FO mice had minimal to mild glomerulonephritis and no or minimal arteritis in the spleen. It is likely omega-3 fatty acids of fish oil reduce immune-complex-induced glomerulonephritis through production of prostaglandin metabolites with attenuated activity and/or through altering cell membrane structure and fluidity, which may, in turn, affect the responsiveness of immune cells.\r"

  ".W": "Immaturity of the pulmonary surface active material synthesizing system with deficiency of surface active material in the premature lung is an accepted cause of hyaline membrane disease. Lamellar bodies, the intracellular form of surface active material, are produced and secreted from Type II pneumocytes and converted to tubular myelin in the alveolar lumen. Tubular myelin, in turn, gives rise to the surface monolayer, which has the greatest surface active property. Thus, lung sections were studied by light and electron microscopy from 35 infants who died of histologically confirmed hyaline membrane disease and 19 infants who died of other causes. Tubular myelin was not identified ultrastructurally in lungs of infants who died of hyaline membrane disease, despite the presence of abundant lamellar bodies. In contrast, 16 of 19 infants dying of other causes had easily identifiable tubular myelin in addition to lamellar bodies. The absence of tubular myelin in the hyaline membrane disease patients suggests an abnormality in the conversion of lamellar bodies to tubular myelin. The authors speculate that this abnormal lamellar body turnover may be important in the pathogenesis of hyaline membrane disease.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics and derivation of corneal wound healing fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) were evaluated by studying the temporal changes in the cellular actin distribution of corneal fibrocytes following full thickness 3-mm diameter central corneal wounds in the rabbit. Under certain conditions these wounds heal without neovascularization, allowing for the detailed analysis of invading fibroblasts with minimal contamination by other cell types. The authors employed transmission electron microscopy to localize microfilaments, fluorescent microscopy using NBD-phallacidin, a mushroom toxin which binds specifically to f-actin and oligomeres of g-actin, to localize actin filaments, and isoelectric focusing gels to characterize actin isotypes. During the early stages of wound healing (1-7 days) there is a gradual change in the corneal fibrocytes adjacent to the wound margin characterized by the development of extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules, a prominent Golgi apparatus, and a cortical microfilament network. This is in contrast to the normal fibrocyte, which, for the most part, lacks these structures. The development of microfilaments correlated with increased NBD-phallacidin fluorescence of fibrocytes adjacent to the wound as compared with fibrocytes farther removed from the site of injury. Fibroblasts appearing within the wound from 7 days to 2 months after injury had ultrastructural characteristics similar to those of myofibroblasts, including parallel arrays of microfilaments, stress fibers and cell-cell, cell-matrix attachments. Furthermore, these cells stained intensely with NBD-phallacidin, supporting the ultrastructural findings. At 1 month after injury, cells contained within the wound possessed predominantly nonmuscle isoactins (gamma) as seen by silver staining of isoelectric focusing gels, but little or no (smooth muscle) isoactins could be detected. Moreover, no significant differences could be detected between electrophoretic profiles obtained from wounded versus normal corneas. These morphologic and biochemical data suggest that the corneal fibrocyte may develop into a fibroblastlike cell similar to the myofibroblast, and is characterized by a marked increase in filamentous actin.\r"

The intraglomerular shift of the carbon, evaluated by counting the particles at several time intervals after carbon injection, demonstrated the movement of the carbon from the glomerular capillaries to the extraglomerular areas. Electron-microscopic examination disclosed that most of the increased cells of the glomeruli were mononuclear phagocytes rich in ingested carbon particles and that extracellular carbon was scarcely present. This strongly suggested that the carbon particles observed at the light-microscopic level reflected those ingested by the phagocytes. The mesangial cells per se scarcely ingested carbon particles. Instead, mononuclear cells, extending their cytoplasmic protrusions toward the dense (immune complex) deposits, were frequently noticed. It is concluded that the mononuclear phagocyte is a principal component of the hypercellular glomeruli, presumably contributing to the scavenging of the mesangium, and also that there is a pathway in the mesangium for these cells to shift from the capillary to the extraglomerular area by way of the vascular pole and lacis area.\r"

The authors examined whether arthritis induced with the positively charged antigen amidated bovine serum albumin (aBSA) could be modulated with a nonimmunogenic polycation by competition for anionic retention sites in the joint. Concomitant intraarticular injection of aBSA with the cationic protein protamine chloride (pI approximately 10) strongly reduced the retention of aBSA. Detailed analysis revealed that the retention of aBSA in the noncartilaginous tissues was significantly reduced by protamine, whereas the retention in the highly negatively charged cartilage was completely prevented. Joint inflammation was already significantly suppressed at Day 3 and suppression was still demonstrable at Day 28. Protamine treatment also caused a highly significant reduction in cartilage damage and bone apposition. Control experiments indicated that the suppressive effect of protamine was related to its interference with antigen retention in the joint and not to a mere antiinflammatory action.\r"

  ".W": "Relatively little is known about monocyte emigration from the vasculature or about the factors that regulate this process. In this study, a human in vitro model of a blood vessel wall was used for examination of monocyte transendothelial migration. Umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown to confluency on amnion connective tissue, and human monocytes were stimulated to cross the monolayer in response to the chemoattractants leukotriene B4 or f-Met-Leu-Phe. The pattern and time course of monocyte migration were similar for the two chemotactic factors. In both cases, approximately 40-50% of the adherent monocytes extended single or multiple pseudopods into the apical endothelial surface. This indenting behavior was also observed in the absence of chemotactic factors. It was not affected by the medium (M199 or Gey's) or method of monocyte isolation. Neutrophils also displayed this behavior, but only about half as many neutrophils as monocytes indented the endothelial surface. The integrity of the endothelium remained intact as the monocytes traversed the monolayer. When the monocytes reached the basal surface of the endothelium, they frequently wedged themselves between the basal surface of the endothelium and its basal lamina. The monocytes then invaded the basal lamina and accumulated in the connective tissue. In response to both f-Met-Leu-Phe and leukotriene B4, monocyte migration across the endothelium began as early as 10 minutes. The average rate of accumulation in the connective tissue peaked at 30 minutes; and by 60 minutes, 25-35% of the monocytes had traversed the monolayer. Approximately two to three times as many monocytes traversed the endothelium under conditions of chemotaxis as under conditions of chemokinesis or random migration. These studies provide the basis for understanding the process of monocyte migration out of the bloodstream and lay the foundation for the study of their differentiation into macrophages in the connective tissue.\r"

Wide-ranging morphologic presentations were observed, including carcinomas, sarcomas, \"mixed epithelial-mesenchymal\" tumors, and undifferentiated tumors. In addition to epidermoid and adenocarcinomas, several tumors were morphologically indistinguishable from hepatocellular carcinomas. The \"mixed epithelial-mesenchymal\" tumors reproduced most of the various histologic features of human hepatoblastomas. In many instances, the epithelial component occupied focal areas of tumors, and transmission electron microscopic studies of the \"sarcomatous\" regions revealed either spindle-shaped epithelial tumor cells or, in most cases, scattered epithelial tumor cells surrounded by numerous fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. Similar findings were observed in several \"sarcomas\" examined ultrastructurally, which suggests that most of the mixed tumors or sarcomas actually were spindle cell carcinomas and/or carcinomas with marked host fibroblastic reaction. However, in a few mixed tumors produced by clonally derived cell strains, unequivocal carcinosarcomas with neoplastic osteoid or chondroid tissue were demonstrated. The findings of this study are discussed in the context of current insights on the cellular composition of the liver and on the histogenesis of human hepatoblastoma.\r"

In the rabbit endometrial epithelium, a balance is maintained between cell proliferation and cell death which seems to be under ovarian hormonal control. In this study the authors determined cell proliferation by quantitating the mitotic index (MI) and cell death by quantitating the death index (DI) in uterine histologic sections from whole animals that were hormone treated versus control rabbits. E caused proliferation of uterine epithelial cells and decreased the DI transiently, while P also increased proliferation but decreased the DI dramatically. In a time course study, after a single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin to induce pseudopregnancy, there was transient decrease in the DI and an increase in the MI between Days 2 and 5. In pseudopregnant animals, hormones had no effect in intact animals, but after ovariectomy there was about a 124-fold increase in the DI, which could be prevented by P administration. The predominant type of cell death observed in this system is apoptosis (97.5%), as opposed to necrosis (2.5%). Thus, it is proposed that cell death may be as important as cell proliferation in the regulation of normal uterine epithelial growth.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty human endometria were selected from women aged 21-54 years who had undergone routine dilation and curettage procedures for tubal ligation, infertility dating, and irregular menstrual cycling. Histologic sections of the cases chosen were examined to exclude any major pathologic condition (including chronic endometritis). The specimens were stained with monoclonal antibodies to a common leukocytic antigen (H Leu-1 and PD7/26), pan-T-cell antigen (UCHT1), T helper/inducer and T suppressor/cytotoxic antigens (Leu-3a and UCHT4, respectively), pan-B cell antigen (To15 and Leu-12), and macrophage antigens (UCHM1 and Leu-M3). Other antibodies used included TAL-1B5 (anti-HLA-DR), Leu-7 (natural killer cell) and Na 1/34 (anti-T6/Langerhans/interdigitating reticulum cell). The endometria contained significant numbers of common leukocyte antigen-positive cells (occupying approximately 10-15% of the stroma), the numbers of which appeared to increase in the late secretory/pre-menstrual phase (20-25% of the stroma). The major leukocyte populations were T cells and macrophages; the latter, with neutrophils, appeared to account for the premenstrual increase in leukocytes. T cells were distributed both diffusely in the stroma and in periglandular stromal aggregates closely applied to the glands. The T8+ suppressor/cytotoxic population was predominant within the stromal nodules. In addition, scattered intraepithelial T suppressor/cytotoxic cells were present. Macrophages (UCHM1 and HLA-DR+) were also distributed diffusely in the stroma and as part of the periglandular stromal aggregates, in areas sending long cell processes into the epithelium. B cells appeared to be limited to scattered cells in the stroma, only increasing in number within lymphoid follicles. Natural killer cells, as defined by Leu-7+ cells, were also present, scattered singly in the stroma and within lymphoid follicles. The demonstration of large mononuclear dendritic-appearing Na 1/34+ cells within the glands of the endometrium in 5/30 cases suggests the presence of T6+ Langerhans/interdigitating reticulum cells in the endometrium. Thus, the normal endometrium has an important population of immunologically competent cells. Further study of these cell populations may elucidate their contribution, if any, to pathologic conditions in the endometrium.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor cells from the Hodgkin's cell line HDLM-1 were cultured in extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated flasks. Within 24 hours, the cells underwent rapid differentiation, accompanied by morphologic and phenotypic changes. A slow and less prominent, but similar change was observed in HDLM-1 cells after they had been induced with phorbol ester for 5 days. The ECM-induced cells became HeFi-1-negative and expressed antigens 2H9 and 1E9 on their nuclear membranes. These cells had punctate acid-phosphatase and esterase activities. Approximately 70% of the ECM-induced cells were elongated and had long, blunt cytoplasmic projections. These findings, together with evidence the authors previously presented, indicate that H-RS cells are related to interdigitating reticulum cells. The authors believe that the ECM-induced HDLM-1 cells can be used as an important model for studies of the nature and cell lineage of Hodgkin's disease.\r"

This study defines the effects of ambient concentrations of ozone on the character and amount of mucosubstances in epithelium of nasal mucosa. Bonnet monkeys were exposed to 0.00 or 0.15 ppm O3 (8 hr/day) for 6 or 90 days, anesthetized, and exsanguinated. Nasal cavities were fixed with Karnovsky's fixative, decalcified, and processed for light microscopy, and sections were stained with alcian blue (pH 2.5)/periodic acid-Schiff or high iron diamine. Volume densities of secretory material in nasal epithelium were determined with the use of a Quantimet 900 image analyzer. After 6 days' exposure there were significant increases in both acidic and neutral glycoconjugates stored in transitional and respiratory epithelium. After 90 days there was significantly less mucosubstance than at 6 days. Only in the transitional epithelium did the total and sulfated mucosubstance remain greater than that of controls. Nasopharyngeal epithelium was minimally affected after 6 days of O3 and unchanged after 90 days. It is concluded that exposures to ambient levels of O3 induce significant changes in the stored secretory product of nasal epithelium.\r"

On the basis of this model, the authors offer clinical recommendations for reducing the number of dropouts. Multivariate experimental designs for studying attrition in group psychotherapy are discussed, and the authors suggest possible directions for future research.\r"

Self-destructive ideation or behavior was present in 40% of the adolescents. Nearly all visits were judged to have represented genuine emergencies.\r"
