  ".W": "Intestinal mucosal atrophy, as induced by total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and/or prolonged bowel rest, is hypothesized to enhance bowel endotoxin (LPS) translocation and may alter host responses to infection. To examine the effect of TPN-induced bowel atrophy on the response to LPS, 12 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either enteral feedings (ENT, n = 6) or seven days of TPN without oral intake (TPN, n = 6). Enteral or TPN feedings were terminated 12 hours before the study period when a constant dextrose infusion (50 mg/kg/hour) was initiated and continued throughout the subsequent study period. After placement of arterial, hepatic vein, and femoral vein catheters, metabolic parameters were determined before and for six hours after an intravenous E. coli LPS challenge (20 U/kg). Subsequent peak levels of arterial glucagon (ENT, 189 +/- 39 pg/mL; TPN, 428 +/- 48; p less than 0.01), arterial epinephrine (ENT, 236 +/- 52 pg/mL; TPN, 379 +/- 49; p less than 0.05) and hepatic venous cachectin/tumor necrosis factor (cachectin/TNF) (ENT, 250 +/- 56 pg/mL; TPN, 479 +/- 136; p less than 0.05) were significantly higher in the TPN group than in the ENT group. The extremity efflux of lactate (ENT, -16 +/- 4 micrograms/min-100cc tissue; TPN, -52 +/- 13; t = 2 hours; p less than 0.05) and of amino acids (ENT, -334 +/- 77 nmol/min-100cc tissue; TPN, -884 +/- 58; t = 4 hours; p less than 0.05) were higher in the TPN subjects after the endotoxin challenge. Circulating C-reactive Protein (CRP) levels measured 24 hours postendotoxin were also significantly higher in the TPN subjects (ENT, 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/dL; TPN, 3.2 +/- 0.3; p less than 0.01). Hence the counter-regulatory hormone and splanchnic cytokine responses to LPS were enhanced after TPN and bowel rest. This is associated with a magnified acute-phase response, peripheral amino acid mobilization, and peripheral lactate production. Thus antecedent TPN may influence the metabolic alterations seen in infection and sepsis via both an exaggerated counter-regulatory hormone response as well as an enhanced systemic and splanchnic production of cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have described the mean optimal replacement daily dose of levothyroxine sodium in subjects with primary hypothyroidism. Furthermore, a cautious approach in replacement therapy of the elderly population is well established. However, the initial dose of levothyroxine has remained variable, especially in young subjects, since the guidelines for the prediction of the final replacement dose are scarce. This study assessed the efficacy of pretreatment thyroid hormone indexes in determination of the final maintenance levothyroxine dose in 156 subjects with primary hypothyroidism. The optimal daily levothyroxine dose as defined by normalization of serum thyroxine and basal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone response to the intravenous administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, varied between 50 micrograms and 200 micrograms and, hence, the subjects were grouped according to the final levothyroxine dose. Significant correlations were noted between the levothyroxine dose for individual groups and pretreatment serum triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations. However, the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration demonstrated a markedly closer relationship with the levothyroxine dose than did either triiodothyronine or thyroxine for both comparisons. Furthermore, when assessed for all subjects, the correlation between levothyroxine dose and thyroid-stimulating hormone level, alone, remained significant. This study demonstrates that obtaining routine thyroid hormone indexes prior to initiation of replacement levothyroxine therapy may be reliable predictors of the final levothyroxine dose; serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration being the best index. Thus, the levothyroxine dose may be reliably predicted depending on a specific range of thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Therefore, in an individual subject, aiming for the predicted dose rather than the mean dose, a procedure described in the medical literature, may be more helpful in arriving at an optimal levothyroxine dose.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients with gram-negative lower respiratory tract infections were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin to evaluate efficacy and safety. Relationships between individual pharmacokinetics and clinical and bacteriologic outcome were studied. Ciprofloxacin concentrations in plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Respiratory secretion cultures were obtained daily to determine the eradication day of the infecting organism. Susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration) to ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobials was determined using standard microdilution techniques. The mean age of the patients was 70 years. They had multiple underlying diseases, and two thirds of them were ventilator dependent at entry. Approximately 50% of the patients had failed previous treatment for the same infections. Patients infected with Enterobacteriaceae or Haemophilus influenzae with minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than 0.25 mg/L responded well to intravenous ciprofloxacin therapy (200 mg every 12 hours). The organisms were eradicated from sputum cultures usually within 1 day after ciprofloxacin therapy was started. Most clinical failures occurred in patients who were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and had multiple underlying diseases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 10 patients with pneumonia, 2 patients with lung abscess, and 1 patient with bronchiectasis. The Pseudomonas isolate acquired resistance during ciprofloxacin treatment in 7 patients with pneumonia and in all of the remaining 3 patients. We conclude that ciprofloxacin is safe and effective at a dosage of 200 mg administered intravenously every 12 hours for nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae or Haemophilus species. Many patients who had failed previous antibiotic treatment for Enterobacteriaceae infections had good clinical response to ciprofloxacin therapy. Studies using either higher dosages of ciprofloxacin or combination therapy should be conducted to determine if acquired resistance can be avoided in Pseudomonas infections.\r"

  ".W": "CA 19-9 is a promising radioimmunoassay for the detection of pancreatic cancer, but its clinical role and cost-effectiveness are not yet known. To investigate these factors, we used clinical decision analysis to study diagnostic strategies for patients with suspected pancreatic cancer presenting as pain or weight loss. Comprehensive diagnostic strategies were developed to reflect current and future patterns of practice utilizing CA19-9 radioimmunoassay (RIA) to yield biopsy-proved cancer or confidently exclude its presence. The performance of the strategies beginning with CA19-9 RIA and ultrasonography were equivalent in positive and negative predictive values over a range of prevalence of pancreatic cancer from 0.02 to 0.15. At higher prevalence, the negative predictive value of the ultrasonography strategy became significantly better. The CA19-9 RIA strategy used fewer noninvasive tests, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic procedures, and invasive radiologic studies than did the ultrasonography strategy at each prevalence. The health care costs ranged between $848 and $1413 per patient for the CA19-9 RIA strategy and $1186 and $1848 per patient for the ultrasonography strategy. We conclude that the CA19-9 RIA is a useful, cost-effective initial test for the examination of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer.\r"

In this study, rats were given intraventricular injections of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine to permanently reduce the dopamine content of the corpus striatum by 98%. Although the rats were akinetic in their home cages, they swam effectively when placed in deep water and escaped from a shallow floating ice bath. These behaviors were not abolished by pretreating the animals with the dopamine antagonists haloperidol and SCH-23390. In contrast, haloperidol completely blocked the brain-damaged animals' behavioral responses to amphetamine. These results suggest that the paradoxical kinesia of dopamine-depleted rats is not a consequence of dopamine release from residual dopaminergic fibers.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and oils enriched in its precursor fatty acids suppress inflammation and joint tissue injury in several animal models. Since synovial cell proliferation is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis, we studied the effect of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), an immediate precursor of PGE1, on the growth of human adherent synovial cells (ASC) in tissue culture. When stimulated by appropriate concentrations of recombinant interleukin-1 beta (rIL-1 beta), ASC proliferate and produce PGE. DGLA-enriched medium suppressed both baseline and rIL-1 beta-stimulated ASC growth fivefold, compared with medium supplemented with arachidonic acid. Indomethacin reduced the effect of the DGLA. Synovial cells incorporated the DGLA, and rIL-1 beta-stimulated cells that were incubated with DGLA exhibited a 14-fold increase in PGE1 (to 25.2 +/- 6.0 ng/ml, mean +/- SD) and a 70% decrease in PGE2 (to 25.2 +/- 4.2 ng/ml) compared with cells in control medium. At equivalent concentrations (5 x 10(-7) M), PGE1 increased the level of cellular cAMP to a greater extent than did PGE2 (16.8 +/- 2.0 pmoles versus 4.3 +/- 1.9 pmoles, mean +/- SEM). Exogenous PGE1 was also a more effective inhibitor of cell growth. Similarly, cAMP concentrations in cells exposed to DGLA for 6 hours were greater than concentrations in arachidonic acid-enriched cultures (17.8 +/- 3.3 pmoles versus 2.1 +/- 2.0 pmoles). These observations suggest that DGLA can restrain ASC growth, an effect which may be due to its capacity to increase PGE1 production and subsequent cellular cAMP concentration.\r"

Running increased the levels of proteoglycans in the cartilage of the patella, the superior patellofemoral groove, and the summit of the medial condyle of the femur, all of which are considered contact sites subject to enhanced loading caused by running. The elevated content of uronic acid at the femoral sites proved to be due to proteoglycans that were unable to aggregate with hyaluronic acid. There was no change in the content of aggregating proteoglycans. Analysis of chondroitinase AC-derived disaccharides at the same sites showed an increase in chondroitin-6-sulfate content as compared with chondroitin-4-sulfate levels. We believe that this modulation of the proteoglycan matrix reflects enhanced tissue maturation and physiologic adjustment to higher local contact pressures.\r"

Comparison of gp130 peptide maps of SIVmac142 by computer graphic analysis revealed a variation in relative spot intensity of up to 20%. No major variability of gp130 was observed in SIVmac142 propagated in HUT-78 cells (i.e. without cytopathic effect induction) in up to 60 passages. However, in MT-2 cells, which are lysed by this virus, gp130 exhibited significant variability and displayed six additional fragments in peptide maps after 24 passages. Peptide map of SIVmac142 gp130 obtained after 60 passages in MT-2 cells was comparable to that after 24 passages. Alterations in the intensity of certain spots indicated changes in the composition of the replicating virus population.\r"

Subsequent addition of fetal calf serum or bovine and human serum albumin blocked GM1 action on CD4 expression, most likely through the formation of ganglioside-albumin complexes. Removal of GM1 from the medium was followed by the prompt reappearance of CD4 on the cell surface. GM1 treatment of H9 and Molt-3 cells greatly reduced HIV-1 infectivity, which was evaluated by reverse transcriptase activity levels in culture supernatants and p24 detection on target cells. GM1 also inhibited syncytial formation in Molt-3 cells even when treatment was initiated 24h after infection. The GM1 effect on HIV-1 infectivity, however, was not long-lasting since removal of the compound was followed by a rapid increase in viral replication, probably due to CD4 re-expression and HIV-1 propagation from a few initially infected cells.\r"

Groups examined were hospitalized patients (Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease Departments, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Treichville, Abidjan), outpatients at tuberculosis treatment centers, blood donors, women attending an antenatal clinic, and patients attending sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. Total HIV infection prevalence ranged from 10% in STD clinic patients and pregnant women to 45% in hospitalized patients on an infectious diseases service. Within groups, HIV-1 infection was 2-6.5 times more prevalent than infection with HIV-2. One-quarter of HIV-seropositive people were serologically reactive to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Clinical conditions previously observed in patients with HIV-1 infection were observed in people infected with HIV-2 only, as well as in those with HIV-1 infection and dual serologic reactivity. An isolate of HIV-2 was obtained on culture from a person with wasting disease and chronic fever. The results of this study suggest that infection with HIV-1 and HIV-2 is epidemic in Cote d'Ivoire, and that HIV-2 may be associated with AIDS.\r"

Eighty-eight per cent of the respondents knew that AIDS could be acquired from other people and that having multiple sexual partners was high-risk behaviour. There were, however, many incorrect beliefs about HIV transmission, including belief in transmission by insect bites (37%), witchcraft (22%) and casual contact with ill people (21%). AIDS was believed to be curable by 15% of the respondents. As part of the survey, blood was obtained from 3907 (99%) participants; 421 (10.8%) had antibody to HIV-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and females were more likely to be infected than males (12.5 versus 8.8%, relative risk 1.42). Factors significantly associated with HIV infection on univariate analysis include multiple sexual partners, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), injections, and being female. Stratified analysis of a history of STDs in people who were monogamous still showed an association with HIV infection. Information about the AIDS epidemic is reaching the Ugandan population; however, changes in behaviour are slower to follow.\r"

All subjects denied homosexual activity and parenteral drug abuse. Serological testing of the wives of seropositive men showed that 45 (60%) were HIV-antibody-positive. Wives of men with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) and wives of men who gave a history of genital ulcer disease were more likely to be seropositive. The study demonstrates that HIV-1 infection in Zimbabwe occurs through heterosexual intercourse and is associated with other STDs. In addition, the study shows that male to female transmission of HIV-1 is facilitated by the presence of genital ulcers in infected men.\r"

  ".W": "To study the prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), sexual behaviour and condom use among heterosexuals, 193 women and 157 men entered a longitudinal study. Participants were recruited through an STD clinic, and had had five or more heterosexual partners in the preceding 6 months but had no other AIDS risk factors. Participants were divided in groups with respect to private and/or commercial sexual partners. One hundred and thirty-six (71%) women worked as prostitutes and had, on average, 115 customers a month, and 99 (63%) men had visited, on the average, eight prostitutes in the past 4 months. One hundred and seventy-one (89%) women (114 prostitutes) had had, on average, four partners, and 112 (78%) men (of whom 64 had visited prostitutes) had had, on average, seven private partners in the past 4 months. Vaginal intercourse was often or always reported by all participants whilst anal contact was seldom reported. Non-high-risk sexual techniques (for example, oro-oral, masturbation) were practised more frequently with private than with commercial partners (P less than 0.001). Although no differences were found in the frequency of practising high-risk sexual techniques (for example, vaginal, ano-genital), differences were found for frequency of condom use. Condom use during vaginal intercourse was reported more frequently with commercial than with private partners (P less than 0.01). However, if the number of partners is taken into account, prostitutes had unprotected vaginal intercourse with an estimated average number of 160 partners in 4 months, which is far more than customers (seven) and men and women with private partners only (four).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 6923 individuals tested, 558 (8%) were seropositive, of whom 523 (94%) were men and 35 (6%) women. Of the seropositives, 84% were homosexual or bisexual men, 5% were intravenous drug users, 4% were heterosexual contacts of HIV seropositives, 4% had multiple risk factors, 2% were heterosexual contacts of central African partners and 1% were heterosexuals with no other risk factors. This prevalence pattern conforms to that observed in other industrialized nations. For the women, heterosexual intercourse with an HIV-infected partner, intravenous drug use and heterosexual contact with a partner from central Africa were the main risk factors for infection. The important risk factors among the men were heterosexual contact with an HIV-seropositive partner, being homosexual or bisexual, intravenous drug use and heterosexual contact with a resident from central Africa. heterosexual and homosexual transmission were implicated as the main routes for viral spread in this British population.\r"

Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and patients with chronic diarrhoea are forming a growing proportion of the patient population in hospitals in central Africa. To investigate the possibility that mycobacteria may be responsible for some of the HIV-related enteropathy seen in Lusaka, we studied 89 patients in four different diagnostic groups, clinically, by Mantoux test and by microscopy and culture of stool specimens for mycobacteria. In the HIV-positive group with chronic diarrhoea (n = 31), two patients were found to have mycobacteria on faecal smear and three were culture positive while of the 15 HIV-negative controls, three were smear positive and three were culture positive. Of the 15 patients with proven PTB, three had positive faecal smears but none were culture positive. In the fourth group of 24 patients with suspected PTB, seven were smear positive and five, culture positive. Only in this last group was there some correlation between smear results and culture results. Although this last finding is difficult to explain, it appears that there is no correlation between the symptom of chronic diarrhoea and the presence of mycobacteria in the stool. We conclude that mycobacteria do not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-related enteropathy in Lusaka.\r"

  ".W": "It is now recognized that bolus and short-term infusions of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) into different species lead to a slight and transient decrease of blood pressure, while prolonged infusions cause a significant blood pressure reduction in hypertensive but not in normotensive rats. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of prolonged ANF infusions on blood pressure and humoral parameters in normotensive and hypertensive African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops). Human-ANF infusions (100 ng/kg.hr) in conscious, normotensive vervets for a period of 48 hours evoked highly significant decreases of blood pressure (from 124/65 to 104/53 mm Hg), plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and hematocrit. This fall in blood pressure was not accompanied by an increase of plasma cGMP levels at the end of the infusion. Forty-eight hours after the infusion was terminated, the decrease in blood pressure was still significant (97/46 mm Hg), as was the drop in aldosterone. In hypertensive monkeys, systolic blood pressure declined from 175 +/- 8 to 130 +/- 8 mm Hg, while diastolic pressure fell from 117 +/- 10 to 88 +/- 4 mm Hg. These data demonstrate that the chronic infusion of ANF in both normotensive and hypertensive vervets has more profound effects than does acute bolus administration, effects that persist for a prolonged period of time after discontinuation of the infusion.\r"

A seventh patient improved dramatically, but regressed after 7 wk. Three other patients had neurotoxic side effects that precluded continued use of the medication. Two of them were simultaneously taking neuroleptic agents. These case reports provide further evidence that LiCO3 can be a useful medication in the treatment of aggressive behavior and affective instability after brain injury, but that it has significant potential for neurotoxicity in this population, particularly when used in conjunction with neuroleptic agents.\r"

This study examined the efficacy of tissue-type plasminogen activator in a microvascular model using a modified vascular inversion graft in rabbits. Seventeen rabbits underwent this procedure with formation of thromboses in all but one inversion graft. Ten rabbits were locally infused with 1 mg of tissue-type plasminogen activator over a period of 4 hours; 6 control rabbits received normal saline infusions. Blood flow across the graft was reestablished in all 10 rabbits receiving tissue-type plasminogen activator and in none of those with normal saline infusions. Systemic fibrinolysis was not significantly altered. We conclude that local infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator is effective in lysing thromboses that may occur at the venous microvascular anastomotic site without significant activation of systemic fibrinolysis.\r"

The different forms of C3 in frozen and thawed heparin-plasma from 20 patients with psoriasis and 20 healthy individuals were studied from the immunoprint. The total content of C3 components was 29% greater in the patients with psoriasis than controls. The major difference was in the C3b components which were increased by 46%.

Therefore treatments that further improve primary hemostasis in severe vWD patients are needed. Since DDAVP shortens the bleeding time in a variety of bleeding disorders, we investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study the effects of the intravenous (IV) infusion of DDAVP (0.3 microgram/kg) on the bleeding times of 10 patients with severe vWD treated with cryoprecipitate. Their very prolonged bleeding times (greater than 30 minutes), partially corrected by the infusion of cryoprecipitate (14 +/- 2 minutes, mean +/- SEM), were further shortened by the administration of DDAVP (9 +/- 2 minutes, P less than .01) but not of saline (15 +/- 3 minutes, ns). Plasma vWF levels, raised from unmeasurable to normal values by cryoprecipitate, were not changed after DDAVP or saline. The defective deposition of platelets from eight patients onto human umbilical artery subendothelium was increased but not normalized by cryoprecipitate and was not significantly affected by DDAVP or saline. Therefore the infusion of DDAVP after cryoprecipitate may be of clinical benefit for management of bleeding episodes in severe vWD patients. Since severe vWD patients do not have releasable tissue stores of vWF, DDAVP must shorten their prolonged bleeding times independently of released vWF.\r"

  ".U": "90028720\r", 
  ".W": "Plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs) play a pivotal role in the control of fibrinolysis. The mechanisms regulating the plasma levels of PAI(s) are still unknown. We report here that the infusion of bovine thrombin (1 U/kg/min, over 60 minutes) in rabbits treated with 0.5 microgram/kg endotoxin (to induce an increase in circulating fast-acting PAI) causes a marked reduction of PAI (50% of preinfusion value), as indicated by functional assay and reverse fibrin autography. Moreover, blood clots prepared from samples obtained after thrombin infusion lysed faster than preinfusion clots when exposed, in vitro, to tissue plasminogen activator. Donor-receiver transfusion experiments showed that the half-life of circulating PAI activity was shorter in thrombin-infused rabbits than in controls (4.1 minutes versus 7.4 minutes), suggesting an accelerated clearance. As expected, thrombin infusion resulted also in activation of protein C (PC). The following observations suggest a close relationship between PC activation and PAI reduction. (1) Infusion of thrombin in rabbits made deficient in vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins by warfarin treatment did not result in modification of PAI activity. (2) Treatment of the latter animals with a barium citrate eluate (PE) of rabbit plasma restored both the anticoagulant and profibrinolytic response to thrombin. (3) Short infusion of thrombin-activated PE (containing activated PC, PCa), but not of unactivated PE, induced both anticoagulation and reduction of PAI activity. In vitro, incubation of PAI-rich rabbit serum with thrombin-activated PE and phospholipids resulted in a progressive disappearance of PAI activity with a t1/2 of 30 minutes. However, this slow inactivation rate does not fully explain the results obtained in vivo. Our data suggest that thrombin infusion in rabbits causes a reduction of circulating PAI activity and that activation of PC is the intermediary mechanism involved in this phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "Vitronectin (VN; = complement S-protein), a plasma glycoprotein that is also associated with extracellular sites, was identified in washed human platelets contaminated with less than 0.05% of plasma VN. A specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for VN has been developed and was used to detect and to quantitate VN in detergent extracts of washed platelets with 8.1 +/- 4.6 micrograms/10(9) platelets (n = 10), representing about 0.8% of the plasma VN pool. Platelet and plasma VN were similar by immunochemical criteria using Western-blot analysis, although platelet VN was mainly found as partially proteolyzed polypeptide. Total release of platelet VN occurred at optimal doses of Ca-ionophore 23187 or thrombin, whereas no VN was released by platelet treatment with digitonin or Staphylococcus alpha-toxin. During stimulation of washed platelets with various concentrations of thrombin, the nearly concomitant release of VN and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) together with platelet factor 4 indicated the association of VN with inner-platelet storage granules. Furthermore, platelet VN and PAI-1 in Ca-ionophore releasates comigrated during ultracentrifugation in high mol wt fractions of sucrose density gradients, indicating a possible association of both components. Complex formation of platelet VN and PAI-1 was verified by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and accounts at least in part for a high molecular form of platelet VN. The identification of platelet VN and its binding to platelet PAI-1 raises the possibility that VN, in contrast to other adhesive proteins, may participate in localized regulatory functions of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in platelet-matrix interactions and the protection of the matrix against proteolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of protein kinase C (PKC), as revealed by phosphorylation of a 47 kd protein (p47), occurs in platelets stimulated by some agonists (eg, thrombin or phorbol esters). It is not known if activation of PKC occurs with pairs of agonists, such as epinephrine and A23187, that do not individually phosphorylate p47, nor is it known what role the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca++ ([Ca++]i) plays in these events. We stimulated aequorin-loaded platelets with subaggregating concentrations of epinephrine and A23187, neither of which by itself phosphorylated p47. The combination of agonists resulted in p47 phosphorylation, an increase in platelet-bound fibrinogen, and aggregation, but only if the concentration of each agonist was sufficient to increase [Ca++]i if it was added separately. Subaggregating concentrations of A23187 alone released platelet fibrinogen and increased platelet membrane binding of [3H]-phorbol dibutyrate, but these were not enhanced by epinephrine. Epinephrine and A23187 did not increase production of diacylglycerol. Thus, epinephrine and A23187 together activate PKC by a mechanism that does not require phospholipase C or enhanced binding of PKC to the plasma membrane; PKC activation in turn is correlated with enhanced platelet fibrinogen binding and aggregation. These events require an initial elevation of [Ca++]i above a threshold.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cell receptors for tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) have been demonstrated recently, and we have sought to identify a region of the t-PA molecule involved in its interaction with these receptors on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Of three monoclonal antibodies against various regions of t-PA, one directed against the finger region inhibited 125I-t-PA binding to the cells. Synthetic peptides corresponding in amino acid sequences to segments from within the finger region were constructed, and one of these inhibited t-PA binding. This peptide corresponded to residues 7 through 17 of t-PA. The inhibition by this peptide was specific as other peptides from the finger region were inactive. The inhibitory peptide also did not affect the binding of another fibrinolytic ligand, urokinase, to the cells. Although a role for other regions of t-PA in binding to endothelial cells cannot be excluded, the results implicate a short span of linear amino acid sequence within the finger region in the interaction of t-PA with endothelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "To define the junctional diversity of T-cell antigen receptor delta gene rearrangements in fresh T-acute lymphoblastic cells and to correlate cell phenotype with the coding potential of rearrangements, we determined the junctional nucleotide sequences of 13 T-cell antigen receptor delta gene rearrangements involving the preferentially rearranged V (V delta 1) and J (J delta 1) segments using in vitro gene amplification and direct sequencing. We showed that, as in gamma delta+ cell lines, extensive junctional diversity exists in these clones and that this diversity is due both to random nucleotide deletions/additions and to the use of at least two D delta segments. We also showed that a high percentage of these rearrangements are potentially translatable (7:13) and that such functional rearrangements occur in both surface CD3+ and CD3- cells. Comparison of alpha beta versus gamma delta surface expression demonstrates that all CD3+ T acute lymphoblastic leukemias with a functional V delta 1-J delta 1 rearrangement express a surface gamma delta receptor and are recognized by the anti-delta monoclonal antibody delta TCS1, whereas a control CD3+ gamma delta+ leukemic case that had not undergone V delta 1 rearrangement was delta TCS1-. In addition, expression of this monoclonal antibody is not restricted by V gamma or C gamma usage or by the covalent or noncovalent link between gamma and delta chains.\r"

The percentage of cells demonstrating these rearrangements is dramatically increased in the genetic disease ataxia telangiectasia. Inversion of chromosome 7 represents approximately half of the chromosomal rearrangements in this disease. Because the chromosomal locations of the inv(7) breakpoints coincide precisely with those of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) beta and gamma genes, it has been hypothesized that this rearrangement may occur by recombination between those two loci. Here, we present direct evidence that inversion of chromosome 7 in ataxia telangiectasia is generated by site-specific recombination between a TCR gamma variable segment and a TCR beta joining segment.\r"

Of the three cases which showed abnormal metaphases at both diagnosis and conversion, two (cases 2, 5) showed related cytogenetic abnormalities, and the third showed (case 3) independent chromosomal changes. Molecular analysis for immunoglobulin heavy chain and T-cell receptor beta chain genes showed that five of the six cases had rearrangement of at least one of these lymphoid associated genes at conversion to acute myelogenous leukemia. The single case (case 3) in which there were no lymphoid gene rearrangements at conversion was also the only case in which independent karyotypic abnormalities at diagnosis and conversion were demonstrated. Our findings suggest that lineage switch can represent either relapse of the original clone with heterogeneity at the molecular level or the emergence of a second new leukemic clone without molecular heterogeneity.\r"

All nine patients with CD3-, CD4+, and/or CD8+ (group II) showed concomitant rearrangements of the TCR delta, gamma, and beta genes. TCR alpha gene rearrangement was also observed in two patients. Three of four patients with CD3+ (group III) showed rearrangement of the TCR alpha gene with deletion of both alleles or of a single allele of the TCR delta gene. With Northern blot analysis, full-length transcripts of the TCR delta gene were detected in 3 of 15 examined patients. All were restricted to group I or group II. In contrast, full-length transcripts of TCR beta and alpha were observed mainly in samples from groups II and III. Based on these findings, rearrangement of the TCR delta gene may be the earliest event in T-cell differentiation, preceding rearrangements of the other TCR genes.\r"

Consequently, we studied the antimalarial properties of other iron-chelating drugs such as 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHB) and its methyl ester as well as two polyanionic amines, N.N'-bis (o-hydroxybenzyl) ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED) and N,N'-ethylenebis(o-hydroxyphenylglycine) (EHPG) in rats infected with Plasmodium berghei. All drugs were delivered by subcutaneous injection at 8-hour intervals, 40 mg per animal per day. All animals receiving N,N'-ethylenebis(o-hydroxyphenylglycine) died of drug toxicity between days 6 and 11. Peak parasitemia on day 11 of infection was 32.8% in control animals; 25.3% with methyl 2,3-DHB, 15.5% with 2,3-DHB, 8.0% with deferoxamine, and 0.9% with HBED. Subsequent studies of HBED and deferoxamine in P falciparum cultures in human erythrocytes showed a marked suppression of parasite counts by both drugs at concentrations of greater than 5 mumol/L. At all concentrations tested, HBED was four to five times more effective than deferoxamine in suppressing parasite counts. The superior antimalarial activity of HBED is attributed to its increased lipophilicity and higher affinity to ferric iron. These findings indicate that selective iron deprivation by interaction with an intracellular chelator may represent a novel approach to antimalarial drug development, and that systematic screening of available iron-chelating drugs may result in identification of potentially useful antimalarial compounds.\r"

  ".W": "T cells generated during a second round of ontogeny after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) represent a unique model of early T-cell ontogeny in an autologous situation. Since grafted bone marrows were pretreated in vitro with the cyclophosphamide derivative ASTA Z 7557, circulating T cells had to be regenerated from reinfused hematopoietic progenitor cells. The T-cell population derived from 25 patients post-ABMT was phenotypically characterized: an increase in CD8+ cells, a low percentage of CD4+ cells, and a median of 12% CD56+ (NKH1+) cells were found. When the T cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), defective interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion was observed. In addition, proliferative responses of the T cells after activation through the antigen-receptor-dependent CD3 pathway, through the CD2 dependent alternative T-cell pathway, and by the lectin PHA were investigated. Despite the presence of CD2, CD3, alpha/beta chains of the T-cell receptor, and CD25+ IL-2 surface receptors, abnormal proliferative responses were obtained even in the presence of exogeneous IL-2. In experiments where the T-cell population was separated into CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells, both the CD4- and CD8+ subsets were unable to respond to activating and proliferating signals. Thus, T cells at early stages of ontogeny not only possess an intrinsic defect in IL-2 synthesis but, in addition, were unable to express functional IL-2 receptors in response to mitogenic stimuli.\r"

Before the proliferative response, the affinity constant of the membrane particulate fraction to 35S-labeled guanosine triphosphate-gamma-S (35S-GTP gamma S) and the intracellular cyclic adenylate monophosphate (cAMP) level increased in the presence of G-CSF to about 2.5-fold and about fivefold higher, respectively, than the levels seen in the absence of G-CSF. The increases were time-dependent, with a peak occurring 15 minutes after the addition of G-CSF at 37 degrees C. These findings suggest that, following the binding of the G-CSF to its surface receptors, the activation of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein/adenylate cyclase system may be involved in the proliferation of immature myeloid cells.\r"

N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA1004), structurally similar to H7, but a weaker inhibitor of protein kinase C, did not attenuate these responses to OAG or to PMA. H7, but not HA1004, also markedly inhibited secretion induced by the synergistic combination of OAG and the calcium ionophore A23187. Amiloride and 5-(N,N dimethyl)-amiloride, inhibitors of the Na+/H+ transporter, did not inhibit the ultrastructural response and the protein phosphorylation induced by OAG, or the secretion induced by the combination of A23187 and OAG.

In the present study we analyzed the phospholipid- and platelet-dependent degradation of factor Va following clotting in plasma from 15 consecutive patients with LA to provide evidence for a distinct procoagulant effect of the antibody. After clotting with 25 micrograms phospholipid/mL, all samples containing LA showed markedly decreased rates of factor Va degradation (k = 0.01 to 0.14 min-1 v 0.27 to 0.35 min-1 in controls). Also with higher phospholipid concentrations (up to 100 micrograms/mL), as well as in the presence of platelets (5 to 33 x 10(7)/mL), significantly less of the procoagulant activity disappeared per unit of time in samples with LA than in controls. Plasma with LA was to a variable extent capable of decreasing or abolishing factor Va inhibition in normal plasma. Most importantly, exogenous activated protein C failed to correct the ineffective factor Va destruction despite adequate protein S levels. These data suggest that LA prevents the formation of the complex essential for rapid proteolysis of factor Va both on phospholipid and on the platelet membrane, thereby compromising the catalytic function of activated protein C. Our findings offer a new opportunity for a more comprehensive evaluation of patients with antiphospholipid antibody in defining the pathogenesis of thrombosis in this clinical condition.\r"

The cell-type-specific cytotoxicities of the generated ITs were evaluated at the clonal level using human alloreactive T-cell clones. The kinetics of anti-CD4 ricin-induced inactivation of protein synthesis in target CD4+ cloned T-cells was first order with no detectable lag period and a maximum rate of 0.07 logs per hour (t10 = 13.6 hours; first-order rate constant/K = 0.17 hr-1). The alloantigen specific lytic function of the CD4+ cytolytic T-cell clone JMAC28 was acutely sensitive to anti-CD4 ricin, and no residual lytic activity against allogeneic targets was detectable 24 hours after treatment with as little as 0.5 mmol/L anti-CD4 ricin. Notably, both anti-CD4 ricin and anti-CD8 ricin elicited a selective and dose-dependent inhibition of clonal proliferation of target T-cell clones with a maximum kill of greater than 3 logs at 5 nmol/L. No significant \"bystander effects\" were observed for non-target cells. Bone marrow progenitor cells CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM were only minimally affected by either IT. We conclude that these ITs show considerable potential for effective depletion of T-cell subpopulations from allogeneic donor marrow grafts for clinical graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.\r"

Moreover, neoplastic cells reacted with the delta TCS1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) which binds to the non-disulfide-linked form of the TCR gamma delta, but not with the BB3 MoAb which recognizes the disulfide-linked form of the TCR gamma delta. All cases showed a stage II cortical phenotype, eg, TdT+/CD1+/CD3+/CD5+/CD7+; two of them coexpressed CD4/CD8, while the other was CD4+/CD8-. Two cases were positive for CALLA and CD25. Immunogenotypic analysis showed evidence of T beta and C gamma 2 gene rearrangements in all three cases and immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements in two cases. Two patients presented with an anterior mediastinal mass and the third with a solitary inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Our survey showed three types of delta gene rearrangements associated with cell-surface TCR expression that presumably represent usage of three V delta genes. This analysis demonstrates (1) a major subclass of human precursor T-cell neoplasms belonging to the gamma/delta T-cell receptor-rearranging subtype; (2) a narrow repertoire of human V delta gene usage; and (3) the utility of delta gene rearrangements as a diagnostic clonal marker in precursor T lymphoblastic neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Resting neutrophils may be \"primed\" to augmented effector function, eg, superoxide (O2-) production in the respiratory burst, upon a second stimulation with a variety of soluble agonists including formylated methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). At priming concentrations of FMLP (5 x 10(-9) mol/L) that did not initiate O2- generation, two metabolic activities were noted: (1) approximately a threefold increase in the baseline intracellular calcium (Ca++i) level, that was not dependent on extracellular Ca++, and (2) a rapid rise in intracellular pH that was blocked by 5-(N,N-dimethyl) amiloride (DA), that had no effect on the Ca++i response to priming. Furthermore, there were no significant increases in inositol metabolites in cells primed and stimulated with FMLP compared with cells receiving the stimulating dose of FMLP alone and pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PT) (before the addition of the priming -5 x 10(-9) mol/L dose of FMLP), whereas abolishing the response to FMLP during the second stage of stimulation, had (1) no effect on FMLP-primed cells subsequently stimulated with PMA, and (2) only partially ablated the rise in Ca++i initiated with FMLP. That FMLP priming involved distinctive processes to those of the well characterized FMLP-coupled Ca++-dependent activation cascade was shown by the full priming effect attained in a Ca++-free buffer, which did not sustain an O2- response to a second-stage FMLP stimulation, but sustained a primed response to PMA. These data demonstrate that FMLP primes human neutrophils by a Ca++-independent and PT-insensitive pathway, offering a functional model for studying heterogeneous FMLP receptor-coupled reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Concern for transmission of human T-cell lymphotropic virus, type 1 (HTLV-1) infection to recipients of infected cellular blood products has prompted development of tests to eliminate blood units with HTLV-I antibodies. Most hemophilic men from the United States became infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) before HIV donor screening and before blood products were processed to inactivate the virus. To assess whether these men might also be infected with HTLV-I, we examined the HTLV-I antibody status of 127 factor VIII (hemophilia A) recipients and 71 factor IX (hemophilia B) recipients. One HIV-seronegative and four HIV-seropositive persons were HTLV-I reactive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Four of five ELISA-reactive serum samples were negative by HTLV-I immunoblot assay (IB); 1 reactive and 1 borderline reactive serum were indeterminate on IB (p19 reactivity), but negative by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from one patient with indeterminate HTLV-I IB were negative for HTLV-I genomic sequences by polymerase chain reaction. The other indeterminate patient's serum antibody pattern was stable over a 2-year period, suggesting this was not an instance of early HTLV-I seroconversion. These results reaffirm the safety of factor components in the United States with regard to HTLV-I but emphasize the importance and need for further testing of reactive HTLV-I ELISA results with a second more specific technique.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine factors that influence blood pressure in children. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of children aged 5.0-7.0 years who had blood pressure measurements and for whom parental questionnaires were completed. SETTING--School based survey. SUBJECTS--3591 Children aged 5.0-7.5 years selected by stratified random sampling of primary schools in nine British towns (response rate 72%); 3591 were examined and their parental questionnaires were completed. Data were complete for birth rank in 3559, maternal age in 3542, maternal history of hypertension in 3524, and paternal history in 2633. RESULTS--Birth weight was inversely related to mean systolic blood pressure but only when standardised for current weight (weight standardised regression coefficient -1.83 mm Hg/kg (95% confidence interval -1.31 to -2.35). Mean diastolic pressure was similarly related to birth weight. Maternal age, birth rank, and a parental history of hypertension were all related to blood pressure. After standardisation for current weight a 10 year increase in maternal age was associated with a 1.0 mm Hg (0.4 to 1.6) rise in systolic pressure; first born children had systolic blood pressure on average 2.53 mm Hg (0.81 to 4.25) higher than those whose birth rank was greater than or equal to 4; and a maternal history of hypertension was associated with a systolic pressure on average 0.96 mm Hg (0.41 to 1.51) higher than in those with no such history. The effects described were largely independent of one another and of age and social class. The relation for birth rank was, however, closely related to that for family size. CONCLUSIONS--Influences acting in early life may be important determinants of blood pressure in the first decade. The relation between birth weight and blood pressure may reflect the rate of weight gain in infancy. The reasons for the relation with birth rank and maternal age are unknown; if confirmed they imply that delayed motherhood and smaller family size may be associated with higher blood pressure in offspring.\r"

DESIGN--Controlled, five year retrospective survey. SETTING--Diabetic, dermatology, and gastroenterology outpatient clinics. PATIENTS--596 Diabetics treated with insulin (354 drivers) aged 18-65 attending two clinics and 476 non-diabetic outpatients (302 drivers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Rates of accidents in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. RESULTS--A self completed questionnaire was used to record age, sex, driving state, and rates of accidents and convictions for motoring offences among diabetic and non-diabetic volunteers. For the diabetic volunteers further information was obtained on treatment, experience of hypoglycaemia, and declaration of disability to the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Centre and their insurance company. Accident rates were similar (81 (23%) diabetic and 76 (25%) non-diabetic drivers had had accidents in the previous five years). A total of 103 diabetic drivers had recognised hypoglycaemic symptoms while driving during the previous year. Only 12 reported that hypoglycaemia had ever caused an accident. Overall, 249 had declared their diabetes to an insurance company. Of these, 107 had been required to pay an increased premium, but there was no excess of accidents in this group. CONCLUSIONS--Diabetic drivers treated with insulin and attending clinics have no more accidents than non-diabetic subjects and may be penalised unfairly by insurance companies.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients with giant stones in the common bile duct that were resistant to extraction by conventional means. SETTING--Endoscopy unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS--Four women and one man aged 48-82 (mean 66.4 years) with a total of nine stones in their common bile ducts ranging from 2.2 to 3.6 cm in diameter. INTERVENTIONS--Peroral electrohydraulic lithotripsy was performed after intravenous sedation and under antibiotic cover. Two endoscopists took part in each procedure, coordination being achieved by means of a video monitor. The procedures were performed with a Lithotron EL-23 lithotripter and a 3 French lithotripsy probe inserted through the choledochoscope under direct vision. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Complete clearance of the common bile duct confirmed by occlusion cholangiography. RESULTS--All nine stones (mean minimal diameter 2.6 cm; mean maximal diameter 3.1 cm) were successfully fragmented by electrohydraulic lithotripsy, allowing subsequent extraction with the aid of endoscopy and clearance of the common bile duct. A median of three (range two to five) sessions of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were required to achieve complete clearance of the ducts. Patients stayed a median of eight days in hospital after lithotripsy (range eight to 14). There were no complications. CONCLUSION--Peroral electrohydraulic lithotripsy offers a safe and effective alternative for the management of patients with large stones in the common bile duct.\r"

DESIGN--Validation of published rates of non-admission by examination of medical records, followed by a case-control study of non-attenders (cases) and attenders (controls). SETTING--General hospital. SUBJECTS--246 Patients (cases in the case-control study) booked for admissions in four specialties (general surgery, gynaecology, otorhinolaryngology, and trauma and orthopaedics) during April, May, and June 1987 who were not admitted for reasons that seemed to be attributable to the patients. Controls comprised 167 patients admitted to the same specialty on the same day. RESULTS--The validation of administrative records indicated that it is unusual for patients to fail to present for admission without advising the hospital beforehand; this occurred in only 1-3% of all bookings. Information on the circumstances of non-admission and clinical and personal details were collected by means of a six page questionnaire completed by the patients. The case-control study showed that those not admitted were younger and had been on the waiting list longer. Otherwise only small differences were found in the social and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS--Despite a common tendency to blame patients for non-admission, factors due to patients are fairly unimportant.\r"

The results disclosed a remarkable lack of consumerist behaviour. Most people registered with their nearest doctor, and many did not register until they were already ill. Many people knew nothing about their new practice but seemed unworried by this and showed little inclination to seek information. These findings suggest that competition among general practitioners is unlikely in itself to raise standards of care.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients with saphenous vein femoropopliteal bypass grafts entered into a multicentre trial. SETTING--Surgical wards, outpatient clinics, and home visits coordinated by two tertiary referral centres in London and Birmingham. PATIENTS--157 Patients (mean age 66.6 (SD 8.2) years), 113 with patent grafts and 44 with occluded grafts one year after bypass. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Cumulative percentage patency at one year. RESULTS--Markers for smoking (blood carboxyhaemoglobin concentration (p less than 0.05) and plasma thiocyanate concentration (p less than 0.01) and plasma concentrations of fibrinogen (p less than 0.001) and apolipoproteins AI (p less than 0.04) and (a) (p less than 0.05) were significantly higher in patients with occluded grafts. Serum cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in patients with grafts that remained patent one year after bypass (p less than 0.005). Analysis of the smoking markers indicated that a quarter of patients (40) were untruthful in their claims to have stopped smoking. Based on smoking markers, patency of grafts in smokers was significantly lower at one year by life table analysis than in non-smokers (63% v 84%, p less than 0.02). Patency was significantly higher by life table analysis in patients with a plasma fibrinogen concentration below the median than in those with a concentration above (90% v 57%, p less than 0.0002). Surprisingly, increased plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was significantly associated with improved patency at one year (85%) at values above the median compared with patency (only 68%) at values in the lower half of the range (p less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS--Plasma fibrinogen concentration was the most important variable predicting graft occlusion, followed by smoking markers. A more forceful approach is needed to stop patients smoking; therapeutic measures to improve patency of vein grafts should focus on decreasing plasma fibrinogen concentration rather than serum cholesterol concentration.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study with group comparison. SETTING--Based at the Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast, with follow up of patients in all obstetric units in Northern Ireland. PATIENTS--Requests for transfer of 675 babies to the regional perinatal centre (prenatally and postnatally) were made from hospitals in Northern Ireland between January 1984 and December 1986. In all, 343 babies were refused admission to the centre, and complete data were available for 332 of them. These babies were either admitted to other neonatal intensive care units (261 babies) or remained in hospitals with only special care cots (71 babies). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Short term mortality. RESULTS--Seventy of the 332 babies refused admission to the centre died compared with 51 of the 333 who were admitted. Multivariate analysis based on a logistic model showed a non-significant increase in mortality among babies treated in other intensive care units compared with babies treated in the centre (relative odds 1.2; 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9). The increase in mortality in babies who remained in a special care baby unit, however, was significant (3.5; 1.7 to 7.0). This increase was particularly significant in babies born at less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation and who weighed less than 1500 g (8.4; 2.5 to 28.1). CONCLUSIONS--The results of the study confirm the benefits of neonatal intensive care and its particular value in improving survival in babies of low birth weight. As the babies were refused admission to the regional perinatal centre because intensive care cots were not available this deficiency should be corrected.\r"

PARTICIPANTS--All pharmaceutical manufacturers in the United Kingdom were requested to supply data on drug formulations with particular regard to the content of colourings and preservatives. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Prevalence in proprietary drugs of colourings or preservatives, or both, that have been implicated in adverse reactions. Computation of a list of formulations of bronchodilators, antihistamines, and antibiotics that are free of such additives. RESULTS--A total of 118 out of 120 pharmaceutical companies supplied the data requested. In all, 2204 drug formulations were analysed and found to contain 419 different additives, of which 52 were colourings and preservatives that have been implicated in adverse reactions; 930 formulations contained such an additive. Tartrazine was the fourth most commonly occurring colouring, being present in 124 drug formulations. CONCLUSION--Many drugs contain additives that help to identify them and prolong their shelf life but are implicated in adverse reactions in some people. Some form of labelling of drug additives would enable these people to avoid drugs containing such additives.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To confirm the findings of pilot studies that interferon alfa is an effective treatment of Europid men with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. DESIGN--Randomised controlled trial of three months treatment with interferon alfa followed by 12 months of observation. SETTING--Outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--37 Treated men (six anti-HIV positive) and 34 untreated men (nine anti-HIV positive) who met the criteria for the trial. Four controls failed to complete follow up. INTERVENTIONS--The treated group received subcutaneous injections of 5-10 MU interferon alfa/m2 daily for five days, then 10 MU/m2 thrice weekly for 11 weeks. Follow up continued at monthly intervals for 12 months. Untreated controls were monitored over the same period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B virus DNA state after 15 months of observation. RESULTS--12 Of the 37 treated patients cleared hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B virus DNA, whereas only one of 30 untreated controls seroconverted over the same period--an increased response rate of 29% (95% confidence interval 13% to 45%). The life table estimate of response at 15 months was 35% in treated patients, an increase of 32% above controls (95% confidence interval 16% to 48%). The response rates in groups by predictive pretreatment variables were 12 of 31 anti-HIV negative patients (excess response 34%; 95% confidence interval 14% to 54%), 12 of 26 with chronic active hepatitis before treatment (excess response 46%; 27% to 65%), and 12 of 21 with a pretreatment serum aspartate aminotransferase activity greater than 70 IU/l (excess response 46%; 16% to 76%). The combination of these factors predicted response with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80%. Four of the 12 responders, who had all been infected for less than two years, also lost hepatitis B surface antigen. Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS--Interferon alfa is effective in the treatment of a proportion of Europid men with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, who might be identified before treatment. Additional strategies are required to improve the rate of response.\r"

DESIGN--27 Year follow up of patients with non-obstructive focal scarring identified from a retrospective review of intravenous urograms performed in childhood between 1951 and 1967. SETTING--Paediatric primary referral centre and urological clinic in tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--30 Patients (mean age 33 (range 22-41] with non-obstructive focal renal scarring first detected between 1951 and 1967 and a history of febrile urinary tract infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Hypertension and complications of renal damage. RESULTS--Three patients had developed end stage renal disease, seven had developed hypertension, two of 16 women had a history of toxaemia during pregnancy, and seven patients had undergone renal surgery during follow up. Of the 20 patients who had neither had renal surgery nor had end stage renal disease, all had a significantly lower glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow and higher diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration than 13 healthy age matched controls. Diastolic blood pressure and plasma renin activity were positively correlated (r = 0.50, p less than 0.05) and so were fractional sodium excretion and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (r = 0.54, p less than 0.01, r = 0.51, p less than 0.01 respectively). The progress of renal damage was unrelated to the incidence of recurrent infections. CONCLUSIONS--Children with focal renal scarring due to pyelonephritis are at high risk of serious long term consequences. It is essential that they are given adequate attention and care during adolescence and pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the severity of psychiatric symptoms among residents of hostels for homeless people. DESIGN--Survey of residents in two hostels in Oxford, comprising three weeks of background fieldwork, a demographic questionnaire, and rating behaviour over two weeks with a behavioural rating scale (REHAB) and mental state with the brief psychiatric rating scale. SETTING--Two hostels for homeless people in Oxford. SUBJECTS--146 Medium to long term residents, of whom 48 were selected by hostel workers by the following criteria: continuous residence for at least two months, signs of persistent severe mental disability, and difficulty in coping independently in the community. Two subjects died during the study; three (previously long term psychiatric inpatients) declined to be assessed on the psychiatric scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Behavioural disturbance and mental state. RESULTS--Only a third of the total sample had been born in Oxfordshire. Subjects had been accepted into the hostel either by arrangement with the local psychiatric service (22) or straight off the streets (26); 43 had had a previous (non-drug related) psychiatric admission. Subjects were significantly more likely than other residents to have spent longer (greater than 80 weeks) in a hostel in the past three years (p less than 0.02). With reference to norms for deviant behaviour, the 46 subjects assessed showed considerable deviant behaviour (average weekly scores: 0 (11 subjects), 1 (14), 2-3 (16), and greater than or equal to 4 (5] not significantly different from that expected in moderately to severely handicapped psychiatric inpatients (chi 2 = 1.3, df = 3, p greater than 0.7); 22 had scores equivalent to those in most severely handicapped inpatients. Of the 43 subjects assessed with the psychiatric rating scale, 16 had symptoms of neurosis, 29 of florid psychosis, and 32 of a deficit state. Symptoms of deficit state were positively correlated with ratings of low social activity on the behavioural scale (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.30, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS--Hostels are having to care for long term severely affected psychiatric patients discharged into the community. The suitability of the services offered to such subjects should be assessed.\r"

  ".W": "Readmission rates after inpatient care were studied by using routinely collected data from the Oxford record linkage study for 1968-85. Discharges from hospital and subsequent admissions were identified for people who were both resident and treated in the area covered by the linkage study. Rates were calculated for readmissions within 28 days after discharge from the first, index event. Readmission rates for elective readmissions after elective index admissions rose from 3.5% in 1968 to 7.1% in 1985. Those for elective readmissions after immediate (emergency or accident) index admissions rose from 2.4% to 3.5% during the same period. Emergency readmissions after an immediate index admission rose from 4.0% to 7.0%, and emergency readmissions after an elective index admission rose from 1.3% to 2.5%. All these increases were significant. The rise in elective readmissions may in part reflect a trend towards planned discharge with the expectation of readmission. The rise in emergency readmissions, which has been fairly gradual over many years, may, in some cases, be due to pressure on resources and inappropriately short lengths of stay. Further evidence is required to confirm or refute this. Readmission rates are one of the few potential measures available from routine statistics for assessing outcome, but due consideration must be given to issues of method and interpretation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess current practice and opinions of general practitioners in London about managing psychological and social problems relating to HIV infection. DESIGN--A stratified random sample of general practitioners, including those with a range of experience of people with HIV infection, were interviewed by medically trained interviewers. SETTING--Doctor's surgeries. PARTICIPANTS--270 General practitioners working within the area covered by London postcodes. RESULTS--Two thirds of doctors had treated at least one patient with HIV infection and described their work with these patients. General practitioners were counselling and educating many of their patients about AIDS and associated risk behaviours and were aware of the need for careful attention to confidentiality. Doctors with no experience of patients with HIV infection were often older, in singlehanded practice, less inclined to deal with drug abusers or to counsel their patients on risk behaviours, and more in favour of insurance companies' policies towards people with HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS--General practitioners in London are quickly becoming involved in the care of patients with HIV infection and their relatives and friends. Many are counselling patients and testing for antibodies themselves and regard this as an integral part of their work. A considerable workload in primary care comprised patients who obsessively fear contracting HIV infection.\r"

SETTING--Six handed practice in a southern coastal town. SUBJECTS--All patients referred during the study period for whom a copy of the referral letter was available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The investigations carried out by the consultant that led to the diagnosis; the diagnosis reached; and the management. RESULTS--Of roughly 3000 patients referred during the year, 277 with various skin and soft tissue disorders could probably have been managed solely by the general practitioner. Referrals for cryotherapy (96 in this series) and diabetes (19) could probably also have been avoided by specialist training of the general practitioner. In addition, in cases of haematuria and prostatic hypertrophy (34 and 22 referrals) substantial time could have been saved for both the patient and the consultant had the general practitioner supplied the results of relevant investigations. Probably the most important outcome was the model that the study offered for other general practitioners to improve the appropriateness of referrals. CONCLUSION--This approach to determining the appropriateness of referrals benefits the general practitioners, the consultant, and the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past decade the number of families in London who were considered officially to be homeless appreciably increased. In response to this many families have been given temporary accommodation, usually in bed and breakfast hotels, while awaiting permanent rehousing. About 200 of the roughly 600 hotels in London that provide such accommodation are located in the area of the former Paddington and North Kensington Health Authority, now part of Parkside Health Authority. The use made by the homeless population of hospital services was studied by finding out the numbers of inpatients admitted to hospital and the numbers presenting to the walk in paediatric clinic and the casualty department at one hospital. These figures were compared with those for local residents and the overall workload. The bed and breakfast population were high users of inpatient beds, the casualty department, and the paediatric clinic. Overall, about one tenth of the beds were used by these people. The health authority receives no additional funding for this group of patients. Further research is needed to find out if the high use of hospital services made by these patients reflects their increased morbidity or their inability to obtain primary care services.\r"

DESIGN--A population based case-control study. SETTING--Nationwide community study. SUBJECTS--891 Women aged 25-54 with newly diagnosed breast cancer were compared with 1864 women selected at random from the electoral rolls. INTERVENTION--Women were interviewed by telephone about past use of contraceptives and about possible risk factors for breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Relative risk of breast cancer in women who had used medroxyprogesterone. RESULTS--Medroxyprogesterone had been used by 110 patients and 252 controls. Overall, the relative risk of breast cancer associated with any duration of use was 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.3). In women aged 25-34 the relative risk was 2.0 (1.0 to 3.8). The relative risk was highest in women aged 25-34 who had used the drug for six years or longer, although there were few women in this category. Women who had used it for two years or longer before age 25 had an increased risk of breast cancer (relative risk 4.6; 1.4 to 15.1). CONCLUSION--Despite the lack of an overall association these findings suggest that medroxyprogesterone may increase the risk of breast cancer in young women.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective non-randomised study with follow up at a mean of 11 months after operation. Most men were assessed jointly by a urologist and a general practitioner. SETTING--Department of urology in a teaching hospital serving a large district population. PATIENTS--253 Men listed for elective prostatectomy because of symptoms and low urinary flow rates (less than 15 ml/s) and excluding those already on a waiting list or with acute urinary retention, clinically apparent prostatic cancer, and neurological or cerebrovascular disease; 217 (86%) were followed up. INTERVENTION--Elective prostatectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Classification on the basis of relief of symptoms assessed by patients and urologist and general practitioner and of symptom scores obtained by questionnaire. RESULTS--Of the 217 men followed up, 171 (79%) had a satisfactory subjective review and 155 (72%) had a satisfactory review and also low symptom scores. An unsatisfactory outcome was associated with preoperative symptoms of urge incontinence, small prostatic size and resected weight, low voiding pressures, and low urethral resistance. Preoperative maximum urinary flow rates did not predict outcome. Men with poor outcome could be classified into two groups: those with irritative symptoms who were more likely before operation to have had urge incontinence and detrusor instability and men with symptoms of poor urinary flow who were more likely before operation to have had a small prostate, low voiding pressures, and low urethral resistance. In patients in the second group flow rates or voiding pressures improved little after operation. Men with stable detrusors and either low urethral resistance or low voiding pressures were less likely to do well after prostatectomy, but despite these associations preoperative urodynamic measurements were unable to predict outcome accurately. CONCLUSIONS--Prostatectomy was satisfactory in relieving symptoms and improving urodynamic measurements in most men, but even in those with classic symptoms and low urinary flow rates a substantial minority experienced little improvement afterwards and urodynamic measurements did not accurately predict outcome in individual patients.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of medical records of men registered with Danish military authorities from 1943 to 1977 and followed up four to 40 years later. SETTING--Draft board of Copenhagen and surrounding counties and the rest of Sjaelland and surrounding islands. SUBJECTS--964 Men who were severely obese (body mass index greater than or equal to kg/m2 at the first examination) and 1134 random controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood pressure and weight. RESULTS--Hypertension was more prevalent in subjects with an unchanged body mass index as that index increased over the range studied. At any body mass index hypertension was more prevalent in subjects who had increased to this index and less common in those who had decreased to it than in those who had stayed the same weight since the first examination. Hypertension among controls was most common in those subjects who had become obese during adulthood. CONCLUSIONS--Changes in body weight have a great influence on arterial hypertension independent of the effect of attained weight, particularly in obese subjects.\r"

DESIGN--Case-control study of primary sporadic cases identified by the Public Health Laboratory Service between 1 August and 30 September 1988. SETTING--PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Division of Enteric Pathogens, 11 PHLS laboratories, and 42 local authority environmental health departments in England. SUBJECTS--232 Patients (cases) with confirmed primary sporadic infection, for 160 of whom (88 female) (median age 30 years, age range 4 months to 85 years) data were obtained by questionnaire about consumption of fresh eggs, egg products, precooked chicken, and minced meat in the three days and one week before onset of the symptoms. Up to three controls, matched for neighbourhood, age, and sex (if aged greater than 11 years), were asked the same questions for the same calendar period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Association of primary sporadic infection with consumption of suspected food items. RESULTS--Illness due to S enteritidis phage type 4 was significantly associated with consumption of raw shell egg products (homemade mayonnaise, ice cream, and milk drinks containing eggs) (matched p = 0.02) and shop bought sandwiches containing mayonnaise (matched p = 0.00004) or eggs (matched p = 0.02). Illness was also significantly associated with eating lightly cooked eggs (unmatched p = 0.02), but not soft boiled eggs, and precooked hot chicken (matched p = 0.006). Reported consumption of eggs was not appreciably different between cases and controls before or after the median date of interview. CONCLUSIONS--Fresh shell eggs, egg products, and precooked hot chicken are vehicles of S enteritidis phage type 4 infection in indigenous sporadic cases. Public health education and reduction in contamination of eggs and infection of poultry with S enteritidis are needed to reduce the incidence of human infection.\r"

The criteria for diagnosing reinfection are described. In four cases the rubella contact was with the woman's own children. Two women had therapeutic abortions, rubella virus being recovered from the products of conception, and three were delivered of infants with congenitally acquired disease. Though the risks associated with maternal reinfection with rubella are very small and being measured in a prospective study, it is hoped that the recently introduced augmented programme of rubella vaccination will reduce rubella in the community and therefore this small risk still further.\r"

DESIGN--Junior anaesthetists recorded their workload from 1 March 1988 to May 31 1988. SETTING--District general hospital. SUBJECTS--Two groups of three junior anaesthetists sharing a one in three rota to provide continuous emergency cover. INTERVENTIONS--By using the guidelines published by the Civil Aviation Authority in The Avoidance of Excessive Fatigue in Aircrews schedules were drawn up to cover the hours that junior doctors had been on duty. RESULTS--Each anaesthetist provided emergency and routine cover for 48-112 (mean 75) hours each week. To cover the work of six junior anaesthetists on an annual basis would require 26 doctors if they were working within the Civil Aviation Authority's guidelines. CONCLUSIONS--Junior anaesthetists' hours are much longer than those of airline pilots. Both professions entail considerable periods of monitoring interspersed with episodes of high demands on physical and cognitive skills. Errors induced by fatigue made by anaesthetists and pilots could result in death. The medical profession should define rules similar to those of the aviation authority to prevent junior doctors having to work unsafe numbers of hours.\r"

SUBJECTS--91 Workers (86 men) who started work between 1 January 1973 and 31 December 1974 and whose smoking habit and atopic state (on skin prick testing with common allergens) had been noted at joining. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Results of skin prick tests with platinum salts carried out routinely every three to six months and records of any respiratory symptoms noted by the refinery's occupational health service. Follow up was until 1980 or until leaving refinery work, whichever was earlier. RESULTS--57 Workers smoked and 29 were atopic; 22 developed a positive result on skin testing with platinum salts and 49 developed symptoms, including all 22 whose skin test result was positive. Smoking was the only significant predictor of a positive result on skin testing with platinum salts and its effect was greater than that of atopy; the estimated relative risks (95% confidence interval) when both were included in the regression model were: smokers versus non-smokers 5.05 (1.68 to 15.2) and atopic versus non-atopic 2.29 (0.88 to 5.99). Number of cigarettes smoked per day was the only significant predictor of respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION--Smokers are at increased risk of sensitisation by platinum salts.\r"

DESIGN--Open study of patients at start of captopril treatment and three months later. SETTING--A hospital gamma camera laboratory. PATIENTS--16 Men with congestive cardiac failure in New York Heart Association class II or III, aged 57-73. INTERVENTIONS--Patients were initially given 500 micrograms sublingual glyceryl trinitrate followed by 25 mg oral captopril. The study was then repeated after three months' captopril treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Previously validated non-invasive radionuclide techniques were used to measure changes in central haemodynamic variables and peripheral venous volumes in the calf. RESULTS--After 25 mg captopril there were falls in blood pressure and relative systemic vascular resistance and increases in cardiac index and left ventricular ejection fraction. This was accompanied by a 16% increase in peripheral venous volume (95% confidence interval 13.4% to 18.4%, p less than 0.01), which compared with an 11% increase after 500 micrograms glyceryl trinitrate (10% to 12%, p less than 0.01). Eleven patients were restudied after three months' continuous treatment with captopril. The resting venous volume was higher than it had been initially, by about 10%, and increased by a further 8.4% after 25 mg captopril (5.4% to 11.4%, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--Captopril is an important venodilator. Venous and arterial dilatation are produced short term and during long term treatment.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective (from well child visits) and retrospective (from maternal recall) study of breast feeding and prospective assessment by paediatricians of lower respiratory tract illness in infants during first year of life. SETTING--Health maintenance organisation. PARTICIPANTS--Over 1000 infants who were healthy at birth and whose parents used the paediatricians of a local health maintenance organisation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Duration of breast feeding and type of lower respiratory tract illness (wheezing and non-wheezing) at different age intervals during the first year of life. RESULTS--Breast feeding was associated with a decreased incidence of wheezing illnesses only in the first four months of life. Interactions existed between breast feeding and sharing a room, being Mexican American, and being a boy. Multivariate techniques showed that after controlling for a variety of factors children who received minimal breast milk had a greater risk of early wheezing illnesses; the risk was further increased by simultaneous exposure to sharing a room. CONCLUSION--Breast feeding seems to protect against wheezing respiratory tract illnesses in the first four months of life, particularly when other risk factors are present.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of data from one urban group general practice collected during 1979-81 as part of a research project in seven practices. SETTING--Group general practice in the London borough of Brent with a list size of 10,877 patients in July 1980. SUBJECTS--Patients registered with the practice during the 23 months to April 1981 who accounted for 67,197 consultations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Ethnic state, sex and social class distribution, and diagnosis of patients consulting and frequency of consultations analysed as standardised consultation ratios and standardised patient consultation ratios. RESULTS--Compared with other ethnic groups male Asians (that is, including those born in Britain and those originating from the Indian subcontinent and east Africa) had a substantially increased standardised patient consultation ratio. Consultation rates for mental disorders--in particular, anxiety and depression--were reduced in all groups of immigrant descent. West Indians consulted more frequently for hypertension and asthma, and their children less frequently with otitis media. Asians consulted more frequently with upper respiratory tract infections and non-specific symptoms. Native British patients were more likely to leave the surgery with a follow up appointment, prescription, or certificate. CONCLUSION--Notwithstanding the limitations of this study, ethnic differences in consultation rates were apparent. These differences require further investigation if the needs of minority ethnic groups are not to be overlooked.\r"

SETTING--The results relate to people living in private households in England, Scotland, and Wales. RESULTS--After adjustment for age and socioeconomic class, consultation among adults aged 16-64 was highest among people of Pakistani origin with odds ratios of 2.82 (95% confidence interval 1.86 to 4.28) for men and 1.85 (1.22 to 2.81) for women. Significantly higher consultations were also seen for men of West Indian and Indian origin (odds ratios 1.65 and 1.53 respectively). Ethnic differences were greatest at ages 45-64, when consultation rates in people of Pakistani, Indian, and West Indian origin were much higher in both sexes compared with white people.

There was partial remission in 3 patients, stable disease in 2 and tumour progression in 4. The cyclic application of rHu-IFN at a dose of 0.25 mg/day for 8 days, with treatment-free intervals of 3 to 4 weeks, was tolerated well. Side effects consisted mainly of fever and leucocytopenia. From this small series it seems that cyclic IFN gamma treatment might be helpful in some cases of metastatic renal carcinoma.\r"

Radiological changes in the urinary tract were present in 67% of patients, the most frequent finding being single or multiple filling defects in the bladder. CICs were present in 39 patients. A positive correlation was found between the presence and level of CICs and the output of Schistosoma haematobium eggs, as well as between the presence of CIC and single or multiple filling defects of the bladder. Our findings indicated that CICs were present in patients with urinary schistosomiasis, but the different incidence in patients with a large egg output and radiological filling defects suggests a possible pathogenic role only in the earlier phase of the infection.\r"

  ".U": "90029377\r", 
  ".W": "Thirteen patients, including 6 from one family, with the syndrome of myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibres (MERRF) were studied. There was considerable heterogeneity in the age of onset, severity and associated clinical features. Postmortem studies in 3 patients from the one family showed a particular system degeneration. In addition, the youngest and most severely affected family member showed the pathological changes of Leigh's syndrome. Cortical dysfunction is a prominent clinical feature in MERRF, but postmortem examination failed to reveal cortical abnormalities. Positron emission tomographic studies, however, showed decreased cortical metabolic rates for glucose and oxygen utilization, with normal cortical blood flow and cerebral pH. Analyses of kinetic rate constants for uptake and phosphorylation of the glucose analogue, fluorodeoxyglucose showed decreased hexokinase-mediated phosphorylation: normal K1 and k2 values but reduced k3. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies suggested a normal cerebral intracellular pH. Biochemical studies on muscle homogenates in 6 patients showed partial deficiencies of the activities of certain mitochondrial enzymes in 4 cases, whereas in 2 patients no abnormality was found. Our data, combined with previous reports, show that MERRF is biochemically and genetically heterogeneous. Our experience, and analysis of the literature, suggests that many cases previously described as the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, as well as other hitherto unclassified system degenerations associated with myoclonus epilepsy, are examples of MERRF. These data permit the formulation of a hypothesis to explain the clinical, biochemical and genetic heterogeneity of MERRF, and its overlap with Leigh's syndrome. We suggest that different biochemical defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may cause similar cerebral metabolic effects, as measured by positron emission tomography, resulting in similar phenotypes. Reduced activity of one enzyme, however, may result in different phenotypes, depending on the severity of the defect and its tissue distribution. Moreover, the phenotypic expression of certain biochemical defects may be influenced by randomly occurring factors such as fever, which may increase metabolic demand and result in more deleterious cellular metabolic effects.\r"

Thus, anti-cancer agents suspended in Lipiodol can be delivered specifically to liver tumors. Before clinical trials of this new drug delivery system were begun, the movements of drugs suspended in Lipiodol were examined in vitro. It was found that 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C were continuously released from oil phase to water phase, and when these three drugs were collectively suspended in Lipiodol, each was released independently. During clinical investigations, 42 patients with unresectable metastatic liver tumors were treated with intraarterial infusions of anti-cancer drugs in Lipiodol. As a result, the administration of a combination of anti-cancer agents suspended in Lipiodol was shown to be effective in controlling metastatic liver tumors. It was concluded that such a method could be applied to a variety of metastatic liver tumors with different drug sensitivities.\r"

Severe BW-reduction (9.9%) was noticed retrospectively in ten ABMT patients fed orally, despite intensive counseling or occasional tube feeding. A prospective, randomized study of hyperalimentation (25 g nitrogen (N) and 3400 nonprotein kilocalories) with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or partial parenteral plus enteral nutrition by tube feeding (PPN/EN) was done in 22 patients. Nutritional assessment included balance measurements of N, Na, K, Cl, P, Ca, Mg, Cu, and Zn, and serial measurements of BW, serum albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin. Both regimens were effective in maintaining BW (maximum percent of change, 2.5) and N-balance. Blood products accounted for an additional N-intake of 13% in both groups. The TPN group had a higher dietary N-intake versus PPN/EN, a positive K balance but negative Ca, Mg, Cu, and Zn balances. More mineral supplementation was given in the PPN/EN group where positive K, Mg, and Zn balances were seen. Visceral proteins and IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were decreased on days 7, 14, and 21. Creatinine clearance increased significantly in both groups. Compared with TPN, the PPN/EN group showed a twofold number of patients with a positive blood culture, although this observation did not reach statistical significance and patients had fewer days of diarrhea (31.1% versus 54.3%, P less than 0.01). Hyperalimentation with PPN/EN is an acceptable alternative to TPN in the nutritional support of ABMT recipients.\r"

Eleven patients (17%) had a partial response (PR) to IH M and ten (16%) patients had stable disease. Patients who responded to IH FUDR were more likely to respond to IH M when compared with those who progressed on IH FUDR (47% versus 13%, respectively; P = 0.013). Those who were switched to IH M because of hepatotoxicity on IH FUDR also were more likely to respond to IH M than those who were switched because of progression on IH FUDR (75% versus 27%, respectively; P = 0.022). Baseline laboratory values, the percent of tumorous liver involvement, prior history of systemic chemotherapy, and the interval from diagnosis to initiation of IH M did not help predict response. Toxicity was mild and well tolerated. The overall median survival time of the 64 evaluable patients was 9.0 months from the start of IH M therapy. We conclude that IH M has some salvage benefit in patients with hepatic metastases.\r"

  ".U": "90030746\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize adenosine receptors in human atrial and ventricular myocardium. In isolated electrically driven preparations, adenosine produced \"direct\" negative inotropic effects in atrial myocardium (AT). In ventricular myocardium (VE), it only had negative inotropic properties when force of contraction had been stimulated with isoprenaline (\"indirect\" effect), but it has no inotropic effect alone. The adenosine receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline antagonized the \"direct\" and \"indirect\" effects; these findings indicated that both effects were mediated by adenosine receptors. In cardiac membranes from human AT and VE, adenosine receptors were characterized with [3H]-8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) binding. The effects of agonists R-(-)-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA), S-(+)-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (S-PIA), and 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido) adenosine (NECA) and the effects of guanine nucleotides [Gpp(NH)p] were studied also. The antagonist affinities as judged from the apparent affinity, Kd, of [3H]DPCPX were similar in AT (2.2 nmol/l; 95% confidence limits, 1.4-3.7) and VE (1.8 nmol/l; 95% confidence limits, 1.0-3.0). The number of adenosine receptors was 1.7 times greater in AT (26.9 +/- 2.33 fmol/mg protein; n = 5) than in VE (16.2 +/- 2.3 fmol/mg protein; n = 5). High and low affinity states of adenosine receptors evaluated with the influence of Gpp(NH)p on agonist competition with R-PIA were similar in AT or VE. The rank orders of potency for agonists (R-PIA greater than S-PIA greater than NECA) and antagonists (DPCPX greater than 8-phenyltheophylline greater than theophylline) were characteristic for the A1 receptor subtype. It is concluded that A1 adenosine receptors exist in the human myocardium. Since binding properties were similar in AT and VE, the same A1 adenosine receptor probably couples to different effectors in a similar guanine nucleotide-dependent way. [3H]DPCPX is the first radiolabeled antagonist ligand that allows detection of A1 adenosine receptors and their coupling in the human myocardium.\r"

  ".U": "90030748\r", 
  ".W": "Activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) contribute to myocardial injury during ischemia and reperfusion. There is evidence that activation of the complement pathway may be one of the mechanisms of PMN activation during ischemia. Intracoronary infusion of complement C5a during normal perfusion pressure is associated with decreased coronary flow, contractile dysfunction, and PMN accumulation. The mechanisms responsible for these changes have not been identified. Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is a potential mediator of this myocardial ischemic response. Activated PMNs produce TXA2, a known coronary vasoconstrictor, and TXA2 was shown to be a mediator of the pulmonary hypertensive response to activated complement. The goal of the present study was to determine if an enhanced TXA2 production is associated with the myocardial response to C5a and whether cyclooxygenase blockade would reduce the myocardial ischemia. In open-chest pigs, intracoronary C5a (500 ng) caused reversible reductions in blood flow (50.0% of control), regional contractile function (25.8% of control), leukocyte trapping (1.0 x 10(6) cells/g myocardium or a peak artery-coronary venous difference of 5.3 x 10(3) cells/microliters blood), and increased coronary venous TXB2 (the TXA2 breakdown product) from 1.6 pmol/ml to a peak of 6.9 pmol/ml. Cyclooxygenase blockade with aspirin or indomethacin, which prevented TXB2 production, did not alter the response in flow, function, or PMN trapping. Ibuprofen, a known direct inhibitor of PMNs in addition to its cyclooxygenase blockade effect, reduced the response slightly. The pig coronary vascular bed was responsive to the TXA2 agonist U46619, which reduced flow and function without PMN trapping. Mechanical reductions in coronary flow to levels equivalent to those during the C5a infusions did not increase coronary venous TXB2 nor cause PMN trapping but did cause equivalent contractile dysfunction. Incubation of whole blood with C5a at concentrations equivalent to those achieved in vivo did not cause TXB2 production. We conclude that 1) TXA2 is produced in response to intracoronary C5a and 2) cyclooxygenase blockade does not prevent the C5a-induced myocardial ischemia, contractile dysfunction, and PMN trapping. The TXA2 production likely involves a vascular site or a blood cell-vascular interaction. This model system indicates the potential for persistently activated PMNs to cause continued ischemia during myocardial reperfusion.\r"

  ".U": "90030754\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies indicate impairment of coronary arterial ring relaxation and loss of coronary vasodilator reserve after coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. These changes are mediated in part through loss of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and/or myocardial neutrophil accumulation. To examine if superoxide dismutase (SOD), a scavenger of superoxide radicals, would modify the diminished coronary vasodilator reserve after temporary coronary occlusion in the intact animal, open-chest mongrel dogs were subjected to 1 hour of circumflex (Cx) coronary artery occlusion followed by 1 hour of reperfusion and treated with saline or SOD. Before Cx occlusion, coronary blood flow increased, and vascular resistance decreased (both p less than 0.01) in response to EDRF-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine as well as EDRF-independent vasodilator nitroglycerin. After Cx reperfusion, resting Cx coronary blood flow and vascular resistance were similar to the preocclusion values. In the saline-treated animals, there was evidence of myocardial dysfunction, which was measured by segmental shortening (-6 +/- 2% vs. 10 +/- 2%). Furthermore, increase in Cx coronary blood flow and reduction in vascular resistance in response to both vasodilators were significantly (p less than 0.01) impaired; these occurrences suggested loss of coronary vasodilator reserve. Myocardial histology showed extensive capillary plugging by neutrophils in the Cx-supplied myocardium. Myocardial myeloperoxidase activity, an index of neutrophil infiltration, was also increased in the Cx compared with the left anterior descending coronary artery region (p less than 0.02). Treatment of dogs with SOD, started at the end of Cx occlusion and continued during reperfusion, exerted significant (p less than 0.01) protective effect against reperfusion-induced attenuation of coronary vasodilator reserve in response to both acetylcholine and nitroglycerin. Loss of myocardial function (segmental shortening 5 +/- 1% vs. 10 +/- 1%) was less than in the saline-treated animals (p less than 0.01). Cx region-myocardial neutrophil accumulation and myeloperoxidase activity were also less (p less than 0.02) in the SOD-treated than in the saline-treated dogs. These observations suggest that coronary reperfusion impairs coronary vasodilator reserve in intact dogs. This impairment can be modified by treatment of animals with SOD before reperfusion. Capillary plugging by neutrophils may contribute to the altered coronary vasodilator reserve observed in the immediate postreperfusion period, and SOD modifies this reperfusion-induced impairment.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous studies have shown that administration of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) increases urinary sodium excretion and urine flow, decreases blood pressure, and inhibits renin and aldosterone release. However, the role of endogenous ANF in the regulation of renal sodium excretion, blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone level remains to be elucidated. To examine this issue, endogenous ANF was blocked by administering rat ANF-(99-126) specific antiserum (Ab) to anesthetized rats (n = 7). Control animals received either no injection (time controls, n = 10) or preimmune serum (n = 8). Blockade of endogenous ANF caused a 28 +/- 0.09%, 47 +/- 0.08%, and 51 +/- 0.08% fall in sodium excretion at 15, 30, and 45 minutes after Ab injection (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). Urine flow fell 35 +/- 7% at 45 minutes after ANF inhibition (p less than 0.05). Plasma ANF levels were suppressed to undetectable levels. However, there were no changes in blood pressure throughout the experiment nor plasma renin concentration when measured at 45 minutes after Ab injection. Interestingly, plasma aldosterone concentration increased significantly (by approximately 50%, p less than 0.025), in response to Ab. Completeness of blockade was demonstrated by the absence of sodium excretion response to exogenous ANF (500 ng). In either the time control or the preimmune serum group, urinary excretion, blood pressure, plasma ANF, plasma renin concentration, and plasma aldosterone concentration were unchanged throughout the experiment. In contrast to the Ab group, a challenge with exogenous ANF (500 ng) increased sodium excretion by 2.17 mueq/min in the preimmune serum group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to determine the effects of STA2 and PGI2 on the fluid balance in isolated blood-perfused newborn lamb lungs. Vascular permeability was evaluated by use of the fluid filtration coefficient (Kf) and the osmotic reflection coefficient for total proteins (sigma, hematocrit-protein double indicator technique), and pulmonary capillary pressure (Pc) was estimated by the double occlusion technique. All lungs had a period of hydrostatic stress induced by elevation of the left atrial pressure from 5 to 20 mm Hg to promote fluid filtration, and the rate of lung weight gain (delta W/delta T) during this period was determined. Studies were made in four groups; before the hydrostatic stress, lungs were given 1) STA2 (50 micrograms, n = 6), 2) PGI2 (0.4 micrograms/kg/min, n = 6), 3) both PGI2 and STA2 (n = 6), or 4) vehicles (control, n = 5). Measurements of Kf were made at the baseline period and after the hydrostatic stress. Kf was significantly increased by 76% with STA2, by 121% with PGI2, and by 157% with both PGI2 and STA2, but remained constant in controls. In comparison with control lungs, a similar delta W/delta T was observed with less of an increase in Pc during the hydrostatic stress in the STA2 group, and greater values of delta W/delta T were obtained with smaller elevations in Pc in the groups receiving PGI2 or both PGI2 and STA2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism of expression of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in human ventricles, we conducted an immunohistochemical study of ANP in biventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens obtained from a total of 49 patients with cardiac dilatation due to dilated cardiomyopathy (21 patients), postmyocarditis (18 patients), or volume overload (five patients) and subjects with no dilatation as controls (five patients). Four-micron thick sections were stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method using monoclonal antibody to alpha-human ANP as the primary antibody. The frequency of ANP-present myocytes was calculated in each specimen and compared with clinical, echocardiographic, hemodynamic, angiographic, and histologic parameters. ANP-present myocytes were noted in all of the 21 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, in 11 of the 18 patients with postmyocarditis, in four of the five patients with volume overload, and in zero of the five controls. The mean percentage of ANP-present myocytes was significantly greater in the left-side specimens (35 +/- 37%) than in the right-side ones (2 +/- 4%). The percentage of ANP-present myocytes in the left-side specimens significantly correlated with peak systolic or end-diastolic wall stress (r = 0.67 and 0.58), left ventricular end-systolic or end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.75 and 0.69), or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.42) and inversely correlated with ejection fraction (r = -0.73), systolic left ventricular wall thickness (r = -0.58), or cardiac index (r = -0.30). Expression of ANP was rarely seen in the cases with normal wall stresses, normal ejection fraction, normal volume, or normal myocyte size. However, it was seen frequently even in hearts with normal levels of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and cardiac index (compensated hearts). The percent of ANP-present myocytes in both sides significantly correlated with size of myocytes (r = 0.48 at right and r = 0.57 at left side) or degree of fibrosis (r = 0.45 at right and r = 0.48 at left side). These results suggest that ANP expression is augmented in the dilated ventricles regardless of the causes of dilatation and that the augmentation is a compensatory mechanism as prevention against decompensation responding to reduced contractility, excess of wall stresses, or both, concomitantly occurring with cardiac dilatation and myocardial hypertrophy.\r"

If these events are predictable after intravenous recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rt-PA) thrombolytic therapy, then further intervention after its use could be targeted at selected patients. One-hundred ninety-two patients from the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) I and TAMI III trials had successful rt-PA-mediated thrombolysis without immediate coronary angioplasty (PTCA). One-hundred seventy-four of these patients (92%) had prehospital discharge angiography. The mean age was 56 +/- 11 years; 81% were men; the infarct-related artery was the left anterior descending in 76 (39.8%), the left circumflex in 24 (12.6%), and the right coronary artery in 91 (47.6%). Thrombolysis with rt-PA resulted in a residual 73 +/- 13% diameter and 0.95 +/- 0.51 mm stenosis by quantitative coronary arteriography, and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2 in 59.2% and 3 in 40.8% of stenoses as assessed on angiograms obtained 90 minutes after the initiation of rt-PA therapy.

Sinai-New York University Reperfusion Trial, in which change of ejection fraction was the primary end point, the following secondary end points were prospectively assessed by serial coronary angiography: patency of the infarct artery both before intervention and 10-14 days later, acute and delayed recanalization rates, presence or absence of collateral flow, and complication rates of acute interventional catheterization. We assigned 393 patients randomly to groups receiving acute cardiac catheterization and a double-blind intracoronary infusion of streptokinase (SK arm), both streptokinase and nitroglycerin (SK-NTG arm), nitroglycerin alone (NTG arm), or conventional therapy without acute catheterization (control arm). Prospective stratification was based on duration of infarct pain before randomization: group A, less than 2 hours; Group B, 2-12 hours. Baseline patency rates were comparable in patients studied within 6 hours (30%, 40 of 135) and those studied later (24%, 32 of 133). This finding refutes the hypothesis that spontaneous recanalization occurs frequently after 6 hours. The acute recanalization rates of the SK arm (60%, 40 of 67) and the SK-NTG arm (63%, 29 of 62) did not differ. During streptokinase infusion, more vessels recanalized in group A (81%, 22 of 27) than in group B (56%, 57 of 102) (p less than 0.01); this was due to a significant reduction of recanalization rates from 75% (48 of 64) to 45% (26 of 62) with treatment after 6 hours (p less than 0.01). Delayed recanalization, that is, patency at end point but not postintervention, was seen in 17% (17 of 100) of total occlusions treated with streptokinase. In group A, all total occlusions treated with streptokinase recanalized either acutely (20 of 22) or delayed (two of 22), whereas in group B, 23% (18 of 78) remained obstructed. The reocclusion rate in the SK arms was 17% (11 of 65). In the NTG arm, recanalization occurred during intervention in 4% (two of 47) and delayed in 45% (21 of 47). At end-point angiography, the patency rates of the NTG arm (62%, 41 of 66) and the control arm (58%, 36 of 62) were comparable; those of the SK arms were higher (75%, 105 of 140) (p less than 0.01). Total occlusion was associated with collateral flow in 33% (66 of 199) at baseline; the prevalence of collaterals did not increase with time to angiography, which indicates that they had developed before the index event.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Plasma rt-PA rose to peak levels of 2.1 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SD). Fibrinogen levels measured by coagulation rate and by sulfite precipitation decreased from baseline levels of 3.0 +/- 0.9 and 3.2 +/- 1.0 g/l, respectively, to nadir levels of 1.4 +/- 0.75 and 1.8 +/- 0.92 g/l, respectively, and were associated with peak levels in serum of fibrinogen-degradation products (FDP) of 230 +/- 470 micrograms/ml. Forty percent of patients experienced a nadir functional-fibrinogen level of less than 1.0 g/l, whereas 20% fell below 0.5 g/l. Nadir fibrinogen levels did not correlate with patency of the infarct-related coronary artery at 90 minutes or with risk of coronary vessel reocclusion within 7-10 days. However, the risk of coronary artery reocclusion was inversely related to the baseline functional fibrinogen level (p = 0.0008), with the magnitude of its drop to nadir level (p = 0.0003) as well as to peak levels of FDP (p = 0.038). Quantitative blood loss correlated with all markers for systemic fibrinogenolysis including nadir fibrinogen level (r = -0.20, p = 0.0011), percent decrease of fibrinogen (r = 0.22, p = 0.001), and peak FDP levels (r = 0.14, p = 0.020). Both patients who experienced intracranial hemorrhage presented with high baseline fibrinogen levels and experienced extensive degradation of coagulable fibrinogen.

Five patients with acute myocardial infarction who did not receive intravenous thrombolytic therapy underwent a similar injection of radiopharmaceutical. The absence of redistribution of Tc-Sestamibi permitted imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography up to 6 hours after intravenous injection to assess the distribution of myocardial perfusion at the time of administration. The region of hypoperfused myocardium on the initial images varied widely from 9% to 68% of the left ventricle and was significantly greater in anterior than in inferior infarcts (p less than 0.01). The region of hypoperfused myocardium on the final images varied widely from 0% to 63% of the left ventricle and was also greater in anterior infarcts (p less than 0.01). The final hypoperfused region correlated (r = -0.82) with the late resting ejection fraction and with the late regional wall motion score in the infarct segment for both anterior (r = -0.74) and inferior (r = -0.97) infarcts. There was a significant decrease (-13 +/- 11%, p less than 0.003) in the extent of hypoperfused myocardium between the initial and final studies in the patients who received thrombolytic therapy compared with an insignificant increase (4 +/- 6%, p greater than 0.5) in the patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy. Tomographic imaging with Tc-Sestamibi permits determination of the amount of hypoperfused myocardium \"at risk\" in acute myocardial infarction. The change in myocardial perfusion determined by Tc-Sestamibi before and after therapy in acute myocardial infarction is a promising tool for assessing treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The use of intravascular stents may be limited by both local thrombosis and restenosis due to intimal proliferation. In an effort to provide solutions to these problems, we seeded stents with genetically engineered endothelial cells in vitro. Using retroviral-mediated gene transfer, we inserted the gene for either bacterial beta-galactosidase or human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) into cultured sheep endothelial cells. The endothelial cells were seeded onto stainless steel stents and grown until the stents were covered. Expression of intracellular beta-galactosidase and high level secretion of t-PA were demonstrated both before and after the transduced cells were seeded onto the stents. Eight stents were expanded by in vitro balloon inflation, with observation of the seeded endothelial layer both prior to and after expansion. Most of the endothelial cells remained on the stents after balloon inflation. We conclude that intravascular stents can be coated with a layer of genetically engineered endothelial cells that can be either specifically labeled or made to secrete high levels of a therapeutic protein. Much of the layer of genetically engineered cells remains after the expansion of the stent in vitro. In vivo implantation of stents coated with genetically engineered endothelial cells may allow 1) introduction of genetically engineered endothelial cells directly into the vascular wall and 2) improvement of stent function through localized delivery of anticoagulant, thrombolytic, or antiproliferative molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Heart transplantation involves chronic effects due to denervation, rejection, and treatment of rejection. The chronically denervated dog heart provides a model for the effects of denervation alone. These hearts have been shown to contain intrinsic neurons with VIP and NPY as possible neurotransmitters. Myocardial tissue noradrenaline concentration falls to very low levels after degeneration of postganglionic sympathetic neurons, but dopamine remains in near-normal concentration and is probably synthesized extraneuronally. ANP is present and released normally; however, the natriuretic response to atrial distension is blunted, suggesting that this response is mainly due to a reflex mechanism. Chronically denervated myocardial tissue exhibits increased oxygen consumption in vitro and increased Na-K, ATPase activity but has normal tissue levels of ATP and creatine phosphate. Glucose oxidation is inhibited in vivo, associated with increased levels of fructose-6-phosphate but normal glucose-6-phosphate, suggesting inhibition of phosphofructokinase activity. However, the enzyme protein concentration of phosphofructokinase, as judged by maximal in vitro activity, is normal. Maximal in vitro activities of succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase, monoamine oxidase, calcium-dependent ATPase, and glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase are also normal. From these findings, we would predict that patients with transplanted hearts are likely to show myocardial metabolic inefficiency.\r"

Dexamethasone (1.25 mg/kg i.v.) was evaluated in the pig, with pretreatment of the animal 1 1/2 hours before ischemic insult. The isolated perfused in vivo pig heart model was subjected to 60 minutes of regional ischemia of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The ischemic heart was then subjected to 60 minutes of global hypothermic cardioplegic arrest followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion, including reperfusion of the ischemic left anterior descending coronary artery region. Phospholipase A2, arachidonic acid, total free fatty acids, myocardial microviscosity, coronary blood flow, myocardial oxygen consumption, creatine kinase release, and regional and global myocardial function were measured. Dexamethasone pretreatment resulted in dramatic inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity accompanied by a reduction in arachidonic acid and total free fatty acid levels. Myocardial microviscosity (the inverse of membrane fluidity) was significantly increased only in untreated animals. Coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption were maintained at preischemic levels only in the dexamethasone-treated animals and were significantly reduced in the control group. Creatine kinase release increased nearly six times in control animals only while remaining stable in the dexamethasone-treated group, and regional and global myocardial contractility and compliance were improved dramatically in the dexamethasone-treated animals. These results indicate that dexamethasone enhances myocardial function by preserving membrane structure through inhibition of phospholipase activation, thereby preventing phospholipid degradation and maintaining membrane integrity and fluidity.\r"

Nine patients had LLA based on a prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time or by anticardiolipin assay by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. The ages of the patients ranged from 23 to 57 years. There were seven (78%) men, six (67%) blacks, two (22%) diabetic patients, and three (33%) hypertensive patients. One patient had systemic lupus erythematosus. All patients except one were cigarette smokers. Four patients had concurrent regulatory protein abnormalities: three protein C deficiencies, one protein S deficiency, and one plasminogen deficiency. The nine patients had 10 lower-extremity arterial reconstructions with two postoperative failures within 30 days. Patients were anticoagulated with heparin or aspirin after all but one operation. Patients at risk were identified on the basis of age (less than 51 years), unexplained early graft thrombosis, or history of venous or arterial thrombotic events. This group of patients is believed to be at risk for early postoperative thrombosis. Postoperative anticoagulation after revascularization for patients with LLA may be beneficial.\r"

The acute haemodynamic effects of intravenous nicardipine before and after 8 weeks of oral therapy confirmed its vasodilating properties, with similar end-points to the initial response after the 8 week period. 3. After 8 weeks of oral therapy all patients improved by one New York Heart Association class and treadmill exercise duration was significantly increased. In contrast, sitting bicycle exercise duration was not prolonged, although, at the same peak workload, changes in cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance were significantly improved after 8 weeks of therapy. 4. Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate predominantly affected pulmonary vascular resistance before and after chronic therapy with nicardipine, although the effects were less marked after 8 weeks. In contrast, the systemic vascular effects of glyceryl trinitrate were significantly increased after 8 weeks of therapy with nicardipine. 5. Increased vasodilator responses to sublingual glyceryl trinitrate and exercise after chronic treatment with nicardipine, in the absence of significant residual vasodilatation at rest, suggests that indirect changes in systemic arterioles may accompany and possibly contribute to the clinical improvement in heart failure.\r"

In addition, we examined the effect of repetitive hypercapnia on plasma beta-endorphin and cortisol levels. 3. A weak but significant negative relationship between the ventilatory response to hypercapnia and basal plasma beta-endorphin levels was observed (r = -0.35, P less than 0.01). A similar negative relationship was noted between mouth occlusion pressure response to hypercapnia and basal plasma beta-endorphin levels (r = -0.36, P less than 0.01). 4. Repetitive hypercapnia prevented the fall in plasma cortisol that occurred under control conditions (P less than 0.02) but had no effect on plasma beta-endorphin. 5. We conclude that plasma beta-endorphin may play a role in the central chemical control of breathing in man.\r"

This study examined the influence of pre-operative intravenous nutrition upon carbohydrate stores, glucose metabolism and protein synthesis in the liver of patients undergoing laparotomy. 2. Thirty patients with gastrointestinal cancer and weight loss (greater than 5 kg in 3 months) were randomized to receive a hospital diet only or a hospital diet plus intravenous nutrition (0.18 g of N + 125 kJ day-1 kg-1) for 3 or 7 days before laparotomy. Patients who had not lost weight received the hospital diet only and formed a control group. 3. Wedge biopsies of liver were obtained at laparotomy and analysed for glycogen concentration, the activity of three key enzymes of glucose metabolism, 6-phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), fructose bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) and hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1), and the capacity for protein synthesis. 4. Compared with controls and the hospital diet group, both phosphofructokinase and fructose bisphosphatase activity were reduced in patients who received intravenous nutrition, suggesting the utilization of glucose for glycogen synthesis with a reduction in the glycolytic flux. Consistent with these changes, patients who received intravenous nutrition had a significantly higher glycogen concentration compared with the control and hospital diet groups. 5. Maximal rates of protein synthesis were achieved after only 3 days of intravenous nutrition. 6. The provision of intravenous nutrition was associated with changes in hepatic metabolism suggestive of repletion of energy stores and a higher capacity for protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "1. To investigate endogenous cardiac glycoside-like compounds in plasma and their ability to inhibit the sodium pump, digoxin-like immunoreactivity [digoxin-like immunoreactive substance(s), DLIS] and 86Rb uptake by erythrocytes were measured in plasma extracts from normal adults, hypertensive adults and neonates. 2. DLIS levels in neonate plasma extracts were significantly higher than those found for normotensive or hypertensive adults. No difference was observed between normotensive and hypertensive subjects. DLIS was significantly increased when boiled plasma was extracted. 3. Extracts of boiled neonate and adult plasma inhibited 86Rb uptake. Instead, when boiling was omitted, no detectable inhibition was found in extracts of plasma from normotensive or hypertensive adult subjects. When present, the inhibition resulted from a depression of the ouabain-sensitive (sodium-pump-mediated) component, and, for the boiled neonate plasma only, also of the ouabain-resistant component. When the data from the different groups were pooled, a statistically significant inverse relationship between DLIS and erythrocyte 86Rb uptake was observed. Furthermore, in a subgroup of samples in which determinations were made before and after boiling in the same samples, an inverse correlation was found between changes in DLIS and changes in ouabain-sensitive (but not ouabain-resistant) 86Rb uptake. 4. Plasma extracts incubated with albumin at a physiological concentration significantly decreased (by approximately 20%) the inhibition of 86Rb uptake observed. 5. These findings support the existence of one or more endogenous compounds which both bind to antidigoxin antibodies and inhibit transmembrane cation transport. Part of this inhibition may, however, not involve the sodium pump. Furthermore, this chemically unidentified substance(s) may be bound to plasma proteins which partly reduce its action in vivo.\r"

Absorption, expressed by the plasma 60 min D-xylose level and the plasma 60 min D-xylose/3-O-methyl-D-glucose ratio, was greatly decreased (P less than 0.001) in the nine patients receiving enteral feeding after starvation, whereas permeability, denoted by the 5 h urinary lactulose/rhamnose ratio, was increased (P less than 0.05). 3. The five patients receiving enteral feeds without prior starvation had normal intestinal absorption and permeability. 4. Starvation of the healthy subjects reduced absorption (P less than 0.05) and this was detectable at 36 h. Permeability, however, was not increased by 36 h starvation. Starvation of the obese subjects also progressively reduced absorption, and this was reversed with refeeding. 5. Changes in intestinal function during enteral feeding are similar to those seen in intestinal diseases. They develop rapidly and are not caused or reversed by liquid enteral feeds. Starvation, before beginning feeding, may explain some of the changes found.\r"

Endobronchial intubation was more common in females than in males, and frequently occurred after emergency intubations. Sixty percent of the main-stem intubations occurred despite the presence of equal breath sounds on examination. Techniques to minimize the risk of tube malposition, such as cuff ballottement in the suprasternal notch and referencing the ETT centimeter markings, were not completely reliable. This study confirms the unreliability of the physical examination to assess ETT position. Chest x-ray films after intubation are indicated to verify tube position, particularly after emergency intubations. Other techniques such as use of a lighted stylet require evaluation to determine whether they are more cost-effective in verifying ETT placement in patients who have no other indication for postintubation x-ray films.\r"

Findings suggest that in IPF low amounts of collagenase plus excessive enzyme-inhibitors may be operating to decrease collagen catabolism.

The diagnosis may be missed, however, in the patient who is euglycemic, has a negative nitroprusside test for ketones, or has a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis. Treatment includes replacement of fluid and electrolytes lost through osmotic diuresis. Failure to recognize the magnitude of total-body potassium depletion and to begin replacement despite an initially normal serum potassium level may lead to fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Serum glucose must be monitored closely to avoid hypoglycemia; dextrose should be added to the infusion once the serum glucose falls to 250 mg per dl. Insulin is required to reverse ketoacid production by the liver; low-dose therapy is recommended. Ketogenesis may be reversed inadequately unless insulin treatment is continued until the anion gap has normalized. Failure to recognize precipitating causes may result in increased morbidity and mortality from underlying infection or myocardial infarction as well as rapid relapse of ketoacidosis.\r"

The slow protocol was characterized by a slightly longer duration of stimulation but a more physiological ovarian response (mono- or biovulatory cycles in 70% versus 19% with the conventional protocol, less follicles, and a lower plasma estradiol [E2] resulting in significantly less discontinuation of treatment for risk of hyperstimulation or multiple birth). The pregnancy rate per cycle was higher with the slow protocol (23% versus 15%).

Both groups were challenged during the peak of their training schedule with 10 mg of naloxone and 10 mg of metoclopramide. The naloxone infusion revealed a significant increase in baseline luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in the oligomenorrheic swimmers when compared with the eumenorrheic swimmers. During the metoclopramide infusion prolactin (PRL) increased in all subjects, with a slightly higher increase in PRL in the eumenorrheic swimmers.

In this study, the influence of oocyte maturity and embryo quality on pregnancy rate was assessed in patients undergoing IVF-ET. Ovarian hyperstimulation was performed by human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG [n = 29]), clomiphene citrate (CC)/hMG (n = 81), and hMG/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH [n = 13]) protocols. Oocyte maturity was graded on a scale from 1 to 5 based on the morphology of the ooplasm, cumulus mass, corona radiata, and membrana granulosa cells. Embryos were graded according to the symmetry of the blastomeres and the presence or absence of fragmentation. Mature preovulatory oocytes yielded the highest fertilization rates. No differences were found among the protocols in terms of fertilization rate, embryo quality, or pregnancy rate. When all protocols were combined, patients who conceived had a significantly higher number of embryos transferred than those who did not conceive (3.6 +/- 0.1 [mean = SEM] versus 2.7 +/- 0.1). When embryo quality was compared, there was no difference in the number of \"B\" embryos transferred between patients who conceived and those who did not (1.2 +/- 0.2 versus 1.2 +/- 0.1), but the patients who conceived had significantly more \"A\" embryos transferred (1.6 +/- 0.3 versus 0.8 +/- 0.1). These data suggest that the treatment protocol did not determine embryo quality. Furthermore, the increase in pregnancy rates seen with an increase in embryos transferred is the result of the transfer of more \"A\" embryos.\r"

In the midluteal phase, the long-lasting (greater than 90 minutes) LH pulses typical for the normal luteal phase, were not found after hyperstimulation. As the length of the luteal phase in these cases was normal, the significance of this finding remained obscure.\r"

The antagonist, Organon 30276, was administered continuously from days 14 through 21, and the agonist, Zoladex, was injected as long-acting pellets on day 14 after conception to pregnant baboons. Maternal baboon chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone levels and sonographic measurement were made before, during, and after treatment and throughout pregnancy of control and treated animals. Two pregnant animals were treated with 3.6 mg of Zoladex; one aborted and one had a stillbirth. Another four pregnant baboons were treated with 7.2 mg of Zoladex; two aborted, one had a premature with a low-birthweight infant, and one had a normal liveborn. Organon 30276, at 50 mg, was administered to three pregnant baboons and resulted in one stillbirth, one neonatal death, and one normal liveborn. The two pregnant baboons treated with 100 mg Organon 30276 both aborted. Therefore, treatment with these GnRH analogues in very early baboon pregnancy could adversely affect the outcome of pregnancy. Thus attention should be paid to the possible presence of early pregnancy at the time of GnRH analogue therapy, which might adversely affect the outcome of the pregnancy.\r"

To study gene expression in the gut, we developed a method to obtain sufficient undegraded RNA from human endoscopic intestinal biopsy specimens for Northern and slot blot analysis. To verify the method, we examined the differential expression of HLA class II genes in small intestinal mucosa. Levels of RNA transcripts for HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ alpha and beta chains were assessed in freshly isolated endoscopic intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens and compared with levels in Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cells from the same individuals. Sufficient undegraded cellular RNA with distinct 28S and 18S ribosomal bands could be obtained from as few as two 2-3 mm endoscopic biopsies. Using chain and locus specific cDNA probes, HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ subregion genes were shown to be expressed in intestinal mucosa, with the relative magnitude of RNA transcripts being DR greater than DP greater than DQ. The same hierarchy of expression was seen for EBV-transformed B cell lines. This method, in conjunction with the polymerase chain reaction for amplifying specific RNA transcripts and in situ hybridisation methods for the cellular localisation of RNA transcripts, will enable studies on the regulation of gene expression in the intestinal mucosa.\r"

The expression of this antigen appears to be a host-specified response to infection with these two hepatitis viruses but not with hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus or enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis virus. To determine whether this antigen, found in parallel with the hepatocyte cytoplasmic structures described previously, is associated with interferon, as suggested by others, we studied by immunofluorescence liver biopsies from chimpanzees treated with an interferon inducer or exogenous interferon for the presence of the antigen. In two hepatitis B virus carrier chimpanzees and one normal chimpanzee treated with the interferon inducer polyinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid-poly-l-lysine carboxymethylcellulose, the antigen became detectable in hepatocytes within 2 weeks of initiation of the treatment, remained detectable throughout the treatment and disappeared within 4 weeks after treatment was terminated. Electron microscopy revealed that the biopsies positive for the antigen exhibited the hepatocyte cytoplasmic changes; convoluted membranes and microtubular aggregates, identical to those described originally for chimpanzees infected with non-A, non-B hepatitis virus. The antigen was not detected in any of the biopsies from a control chimpanzee that received only the carboxymethylcellulose used to stabilize the interferon inducer. In addition, liver biopsies obtained from a hepatitis B virus carrier chimpanzee during treatment with exogenous human leukocyte interferon were found to be positive for the antigen as well.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diverticuli were of varying shape with a diameter of 30 to 110 microns and a length of 75 to 150 microns budding from small (12 to 25 microns), slightly ectatic bile ducts. The diverticular epithelium was disordered. Some cells appeared as bile duct cells, but most were larger, with rounded nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, sometimes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant granules. The lesions were only partly surrounded by a basement membrane. They were all embedded in a tight mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate associated with pronounced periportal piecemeal necrosis. In two cases, a germinal center was adjacent to the epithelium. The pathogenesis of the diverticular bile duct lesion is unknown, but the diverticuli probably represent Hering ducts and groups of periportal liver cells which have escaped the piecemeal necrosis.\r"

Hepatic cells, consisting primarily of hepatocytes, were treated with recombinant gamma-interferon for 24 hr. Northern blot hybridization showed that gamma-interferon treatment caused a profound decrease in pro-alpha 2(I)collagen mRNA levels but an increase in beta-actin mRNA content. The effects of gamma-interferon were then studied in an in vivo model of hepatic fibrogenesis, murine schistosomiasis. Schistosoma-infected mice were treated with daily i.m. injections of gamma-interferon for a 4-week period starting 4 weeks after the initial infection. gamma-Interferon treatment decreased collagen deposition as determined by histologic evaluation and measurement of total liver collagen content. Northern blots showed Types I and III procollagen mRNA levels for treated, infected animals to be only 32 and 29% that of infected controls, but beta-actin mRNA levels were significantly elevated. These results indicate a potential role for gamma-interferon as an antifibrogenic agent in vivo.\r"

Local release of beta 2m from the endothelial cells of the lung and other tissues as a consequence of acute-phase activation due to the contact of blood with membranes has still to be considered a possible pathogenetic factor in this syndrome. beta 2m kinetics and decrease of glutathione content in RBC were studied in 41 chronic hemodialysis patients during cuprophan dialysis. The latter test reflects the RBC scavenger function for free oxygen radicals. Only 30% of patients showed a clinically significant increase in beta 2m. The change in beta 2m in this group between the start and 180 minutes, corrected for plasma volume, was 23.1 +/- 3.6% and the change in gluthathione content between the start and 15 minutes was 4.5 +/- 3.4%. In these patients there was a significant correlation between beta 2m production and decrease of gluthathione (R = -0.61, p = 0.0299). It is possible that the production of free oxygen radicals during bioincompatible dialysis leads to cellular toxicity with release of beta 2m which may be prevented to some extent by the scavenger role of RBC.\r"

The recipient coronary artery was subjected to endarterectomy in 28 instances. The anastomoses proved to be reliable in the early postsurgical period; no bleeding was attributed to the PDS suture. Clinical follow-up for a maximum of two-and-half years, completed using control coronary angiograms in selected cases, demonstrated good results. The practical properties of PDS were evaluated to be at least as good as those of polypropylene. Experiments have clearly shown that small artery anastomoses heal more favourably after the use of absorbable sutures than after the use of nonabsorbable sutures. Because of this finding and on the basis of our clinical experience, we believe the application of PDS in coronary surgery should be recommended as an alternative treatment.\r"

To locate this proteinase in human neutrophils we reacted the cells for peroxidase and then applied monospecific polyclonal antibodies to human neutrophil gelatinase to immunolabel ultrathin frozen sections using an immunogold technique. Gelatinase was localized in a population of peroxidase-negative granules. Double-labeling experiments using antibodies against lactoferrin, a marker for specific granules, and gelatinase demonstrated colocalization of the two antigens in 80% of the specific granules. However, some granules immunostained with only the lactoferrin or gelatinase antibody. Similar techniques were used to examine precursor cells from bone marrow. In myelocytes both gelatinase and lactoferrin were present in large developing specific granules; however, some mature specific granules contained only lactoferrin. Thus, it is possible that lactoferrin synthesis begins earlier than gelatinase synthesis and that overlapping synthesis and segregation occurs during the myelocyte stage. These findings suggest that the main storage compartment of gelatinase is within the peroxidase-negative specific granules.\r"

  ".W": "Because the defect in Cl- secretion exhibited by cystic fibrosis (CF) epithelia reflects regulatory rather than conductive abnormalities of an apical membrane Cl- channel, we investigated the role of different regulatory pathways in the activation of Cl- secretion in freshly excised normal and CF nasal epithelia mounted in Ussing chambers. A beta agonist (isoproterenol [ISO]), a Ca2+ ionophore (A23187), and a phorbol ester (PMA) were all effective Cl- secretagogues in normal human nasal epithelia. Agonist addition studies indicated that ISO and PMA but not A23187 may share a common regulatory pathway. In contrast, only A23187 induced Cl- secretion in CF epithelia. Bradykinin raised cytosolic Ca2+ and induced Cl- secretion in both normal and CF tissues, indicating that receptor gated Ca2+ dependent Cl- secretory mechanisms were preserved in CF. The defective Cl- secretory response in CF epithelia to ISO and PMA did not reflect abnormalities in cAMP-dependent (A) and phospholipid Ca2+-dependent (C) kinase activities. We conclude that (a) a Ca2+-sensitive mechanism for regulating Cl- secretion is maintained in CF airway epithelia, and (b) a regulatory pathway shared by two distinct protein kinases is defective in CF, indicating that the CF genetic lesion is not tightly coupled to a single (e.g., cAMP dependent) regulatory mechanism.\r"

  ".U": "90037567\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the enzymatic mechanisms responsible for AA oxygenation in homogenous cell suspensions obtained by trypsinization of epidermis from healthy subjects. Cell incubation with AA (0.3-150 microM) invariably resulted in the predominant generation of a compound identified as 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) by HPLC and by both negative-ion chemical ionization and electron-impact mass spectrometry. Maximal amounts of 12-HETE were 126 +/- 21 pmol/10(6) cells (+/- SE), and concentration-response curves yielded half-maximal levels for 12-HETE similar to PGE2 at 2 microM AA. Two epoxyeicosatrienoic acids derived from AA were also identified. Stereochemical analysis by chiral-phase chromatography demonstrated that the epidermal cell 12-HETE was a mixture of the 12S- and 12R-hydroxy isomers in a molar ratio varying from 2:1 to 8:1 among subjects. Subcellular fractionation into 12,000 g pellet (containing mitochondria) and 100,000 g supernatant (cytosol) and pellet (microsome) demonstrated that greater than 99% of the 12-HETE was generated by enzymatic activity distributed equally in the two pellets. Both mitochondrial and microsomal activities were increased upon addition of NADPH and were inhibited by carbon monoxide, but the molar ratio of 12S/12R-HETE was threefold greater in microsomal than in mitochondrial fractions. The results demonstrate that human epidermis contains active membrane-bound monooxygenase(s) which preferentially generates 12-HETE from AA, exhibits a 12S stereopreference of hydroxylation, and suggests the presence of distinct mitochondrial and microsomal enzyme systems in epidermal cells.\r"

  ".W": "We report a case of untreated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with histologic progression over 1 yr from a low-grade, small cleaved follicular center cell lymphoma to a high-grade, small noncleaved follicular center cell lymphoma. Both lymphomas had identical immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain joining gene (JH), kappa light-chain joining gene, and bcl-2 gene rearrangements, indicating the clonal identity of the two tumors. The Ig heavy chain locus on one chromosome 14 was involved in an initial t(14; 18) translocation as shown by comigrating JH and bcl-2 rearrangements. However, the oncogene c-myc was in the germline configuration in the initial lymphoma but had one allele rearranged near the 3' end of exon I in the high-grade tumor; DNA sequence analysis was consistent with a chromosomal breakpoint at that site. The presence of the c-myc rearrangement in the high-grade tumor suggest a role for c-myc in the clonal evolution of the low-grade tumor into a more aggressive lymphoma. The coexistence of both bcl-2 gene and c-myc oncogene rearrangements in the same tumor is unusual, with only a few cases reported. Furthermore, this case is unique in the direct demonstration of the histologic and clinical progression of a human lymphoma associated with the sequential rearrangement of the bcl-2 gene and the c-myc oncogene.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro responses of T cells from 13 insulin-nonresistant and 1 immunologically insulin-resistant (IIR) type I diabetes patients to sulfated beef insulin (SBI) were analyzed. Insulin A-loop specific CD4+ T cells from these patients did not respond to SBI. After 1 yr of treatment with SBI the IIR patient's T cell and antibody responses to beef, pork, and human insulin progressed from very high to nondetectable levels. This occurred in parallel to the appearance of her insulin-specific CD8+ T cells, which inhibited the response of her A-loop-specific CD4+ T cells to insulin. A transient increase in her CD8+ anti-insulin antibody activity coincided with a relative lack of her CD8+ T cell activity. CD8+ T cells that regulate T cell responsiveness to insulin are probably present but difficult to detect in most type I diabetes patients. These T cells were identified in only 2 of 13 insulin-nonresistant patients who presented with lipoatrophy and insulin allergy, respectively, and who possessed high-titered, anti-insulin antibodies. Our data demonstrate that CD8+ T cells play an important role in controlling peripheral tolerance to insulin and may abrogate IIR in a diabetic patient treated with SBI.\r"

  ".W": "Endogenous prostaglandins (PGs) influence resistance of the gastric mucosa to injury, but the source of PGs is unknown. Using radioimmunoassay, we studied PG production by dispersed canine fundic mucosal cells. PGE2 production, stimulated by bradykinin, epidermal growth factor, zymosan, and calcium ionophore, was greater in the small-cell elutriator fraction (SCEF) than in the medium and large cell fractions, which contained mucous, chief, and parietal cells. Linear density gradients of SCEF cells revealed maximal PGE2 production in cells of light density. Mast, endocrine, and endothelial cells did not account for this PGE2 production. Macrophages, identified by uptake of acetylated-LDL, immunoreactivity with antibodies to the human Ia antigen, and phagocytosis of fluorescent latex particles, were enriched in the SCEF and correlated with PGE2 production in the density gradient. Magnetic separation of cells in the SCEF-ingesting iron particles enriched PGE2 production. Fractions enriched in endothelial cells present in intact capillary fragments, but depleted of macrophages, also produced PGE2. Regulation of PGE2 production differed among cell types. Fibroblasts were easily cultured from submucosa, but were not detected in the SCEF. We conclude that macrophages and capillary endothelial cells are major producers of PGE2 in the canine fundic mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "We have addressed the capacity of HIV-1 infection to alter the growth of primary CD4+ T cells, but at the clonal level. Single T cells were expanded in the presence of PHA, IL-2, and small numbers of accessory dendritic cells. We report two new findings. First, T cells from seropositive individuals, even those with AIDS and markedly reduced CD4+ counts, exhibit a normal cloning efficiency, and proliferative capacity. This result is in contrast to two prior reports of a low cloning efficiency in CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-infected patients. Second, when we added high doses of exogenous HIV-1 to T cell clones from control subjects, we observed infection but not cytotoxicity or loss of CD4+ cells, following addition of virus stocks at days 0, 3, and/or 7 of clonal growth. The same HIV-1 isolates markedly reduced CD4+ T cells in bulk mononuclear cultures. When tested at day 11, HIV-1 mRNA was expressed in some cells of exogenously infected clones by in situ hybridization; when tested at day 18, several clones could transactivate a TAT-sensitive cell line. These findings suggest that the loss of CD4+ T cells in infected individuals is not the inevitable result of the activation of latent infection, or spread of a productive infection, during clonal growth.\r"

We previously reported that human mast cell tryptase, a 134-kD granule-associated neutral protease, is present in rheumatoid synovium and can activate collagenase in crude culture medium in vitro. the present study attempts to depict the precise mechanism of this activation. To express full activation of latent collagenase, matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) or stromelysin, can be activated by tryptase in a time and dose-dependent manner. Tryptase was not capable of generating active collagenase in the crude media from cultured rheumatoid synoviocytes depleted of proMMP-3 by immunoadsorption. In addition, the function of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) was not altered by tryptase, and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed no degradation of TIMP by tryptase. The tryptase dependent activation of synoviocyte procollagenase thereby appears to be entirely dependent upon its ability to activate proMMP-3.\r"

  ".W": "While nonmutated germline variable region (V) genes have been found to encode heavy or light chains of various human autoantibodies, the use of germline V genes by both chains of a given autoantibody has not been documented. Recently, we reported that the heavy chain V gene (designated Humha346) of the Kim4.6 anti-DNA antibody is identical to a germline VH gene, 1.9III. To investigate whether this autoantibody was entirely germline encoded, we searched for the germline counterpart to the Kim4.6 V lambda segment (designated Humla146) and isolated a V lambda I gene designated Humlv117, which was identical to Humla146. Together with the sequence identity of the Kim4.6/Humha346 and 1.9III VH genes, the current data provide the first direct proof that an autoantibody can be encoded entirely by germline V genes without any somatic change. In addition, Humlv117 is the first V lambda I germline gene that has been isolated, and is highly homologous to the V lambda genes expressed in two lymphomas. Thus, this V lambda I gene should provide a useful tool for investigating the expression of the human V lambda gene repertoire, particularly with regard to autoimmune and/or lymphoproliferative diseases.\r"

There were no significant differences in the in vitro doubling times of keloidal fibroblasts before (p greater than 0.2) and after (p greater than 0.5) treatment with interferon alfa-2b, as well as of normal fibroblasts, in subconfluent cultures. Multiple passages of keloidal fibroblasts before interferon alfa-2b therapy assayed as confluent cultures produced more collagen (171%, 187%, and 204%), more glycosaminoglycans (153% and 141%), and less collagenase (26% and 31%) than the patient's own normal fibroblasts. In contrast, keloidal fibroblasts after interferon alfa-2b therapy persistently produced normal or subnormal amounts of collagen (107%, 73%, and 64%) and glycosaminoglycans (97% and 96%) and normalized levels of collagenase activity (96% and 86%). Normal amounts of fibronectin were produced by keloidal fibroblasts before and after treatment with interferon alfa-2b.\r"
