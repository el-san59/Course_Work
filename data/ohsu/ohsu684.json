One or more specific diagnoses were identified in 100 patients (86.2%), with the most common diagnoses being benign positional vertigo (25.9% of patients) and cerebrovascular disorders (21.6%). Benign positional vertigo was characterized by brief episodes of positional vertigo, a positive Hallpike maneuver, and lack of focal signs on neurologic examination and electronystagmography. Cerebrovascular disease presented as two entities, infarction and transient ischemic attacks, each of which had a distinct clinical picture. Patients who could not be definitively diagnosed frequently described presyncopal lightheadedness provoked by upright posture, and usually had normal physical examinations and electronystagmography. The clinical history, particularly the description and temporal nature of the patient's symptoms, provided the key diagnostic data in 69.0% of cases.\r"

Other studies have shown no association between age and albumin. To investigate the association of age and albumin, albumin levels were determined in 241 apparently healthy subjects aged 55 to 101. A small but consistent negative regression slope of about 4% per decade was found for those aged over 70. Because the relationship to age was small, the finding of hypoalbuminemia in an elderly patient generally should be attributed to disease rather than age alone.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to identify prospectively risk factors for pressure sores and to compare these results with a cross-sectional analysis in the same population. Medical records on all admissions to a chronic care hospital over a 13-month period were reviewed. Data on potential risk factors were abstracted from the initial history, physical examination, nursing assessment, and laboratory studies. Pressure sore status on admission and at three weeks was determined from a standardized from completed on all patients with a score. The cross-sectional analysis was performed by comparing patients with and without a pressure sore at the time of admission. The cohort analysis used patients initially without a pressure sore and monitored for a new sore at three weeks. Factors associated with pressure sores on univariate testing were entered into a stepwise logistic regression model. One hundred of the 301 admissions presented with a pressure sore. Factors significantly associated with the presence of a sore were altered level of consciousness (OR = 4.1), bed- or chair-bound (OR = 2.4), impaired nutritional intake (OR = 1.9), and hypoalbuminemia (OR = 1.8 for 10 mg/mL decrease). Of the 185 patients without a pressure sore, 20 (10.8%) developed a sore. Factors significantly associated with the development of a new pressure sore were a history of cerebrovascular accident (OR = 5.0), bed- or chair-bound (OR = 3.8), and impaired nutritional intake (OR = 2.8). Neither urinary nor fecal incontinence, nor the presence of hypoalbuminemia, was associated with sore development. We have prospectively identified risk factors for pressure sores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated a treatment procedure in which 126 incontinent nursing home patients were checked on an hourly basis, asked if they needed toileting assistance (prompted), and socially reinforced for appropriate toileting. Urodynamic analysis (including cystometrogram), provocative stress test, and behavioral assessment revealed that the nursing home patients were severely debilitated, with 65% demonstrating bladder abnormalities, 87% incapable of independent toileting, and 25% failing to score on the Mini-Mental Status Exam (average score, 8.0). The treatment procedures were evaluated with a multiple baseline design in which subjects were randomly divided into immediate or delayed treatment groups after a baseline observation period. During treatment, the frequency of incontinence per 12 hours changed from a baseline average of 3.85 to a treatment average of 1.91. Three behavioral measures that can be easily collected by nursing staff significantly predicted continence levels during treatment (multiple R, 0.79) and change in incontinence during treatment (multiple R, 0.64). These prognostic criteria offer nursing staff a cost-effective method for selecting the most responsive patients for prompted-voiding treatment.\r"

This article aims to amplify the Committee's position by placing it within a broader context and identifying its justification in ethical argument. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part clarifies the difference between allocation (the distribution of funds between categories) and rationing (the distribution of funds within a single category). It is argued that given the current allocation of funds to medical care, some form of rationing is unavoidable. As others have noted, rationing is already occurring in an informal and piecemeal fashion. However, ethically sound rationing requires publicly debated and defensible policies. The second section of the paper reviews a number of arguments advanced in favor of rationing medical care on the basis of age. Objections to these arguments are carefully set out. The final part of the paper details and defends a series of positive arguments establishing special duties to the elderly. The paper concludes that to the extent that scarcity forces rationing, older persons should not be excluded because they are old.\r"

Longitudinal studies as well as cross-sectional studies were done. Egg-laying activity starts in Lymnaea at an age of about 2 months. Up to an age of about 250 days it increases, and in older snails it decreases with age. Cross-sectional studies showed that the increase in egg-laying activity is due to an increase in the number of animals that lay eggs and to an increase in the egg-laying frequency of individuals. The decrease in egg-laying activity is due to a decrease in the egg-laying frequency of individual animals and to an increase in the number of animals that stop egg laying. Growth (shell length and body weight) ceases at about the same age at which egg laying begins to decrease. The results are discussed in relation to the organization of the neuroendocrine system in Lymnaea and to results of earlier studies on age-related changes in peptidergic neurons in the CNS of Lymnaea.\r"

Results of earlier work suggested that serum from older animals might contain higher concentrations of growth inhibitors that could accelerate the onset of cellular senescence. To reexamine this question, we cultured human MRC-5 cells in bovine fetal calf serum and in serum from cows of various ages. Surprisingly, we found that human MRC-5 cells, which are normally cultured in bovine fetal calf serum, exhibit nearly identical proliferative capacity when grown in serum from young or old cows. Our failure to detect significant differences in the proliferative capacity of MRC-5 cells cultured in serum from cows of widely different ages suggests that the balance of growth-stimulating and growth-inhibiting factors in serum does not vary significantly as a function of animal age.\r"

Prior to and immediately following a 10-week training program consisting of exercising at the prescribed heart-rate intensity with a caloric expenditure of 100 calories, the following measurements were performed: Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), Maximal Lactate Production (HLAmax), Maximal Heart Rate (HRmax), Maximal Workstage (WSmax), Total Cholesterol (TOTC), High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDLC), and Rate Pressure Product Max (RPPmax). Significant differences, p less than .05, were noted pre- to post-training for measures of VO2max, whether expressed in 1.min-1 or ml.kg-1.min-1, and WSmax. No statistical differences existed between the groups pre- or post-training for these measures. The results suggest that the low-intensity exercise prescription provides an adequate training stimulus for older women who have been sedentary and who might be at higher risk for cardiac or musculoskeletal injury, particularly at the initiation of an exercise program.\r"

On initial recording, P3 latency was significantly prolonged in the pAD group by more than 1.5 standard deviations (40 msec) beyond the normal group. Over the course of the next 3 years, the rate of increase in P3 latency was significantly greater for the patient group than for the controls.

At Time 2, 191 of the original subjects were retested, and data were also gathered from a new sample of 207 men and women. Subjects reported on a single event classified as a loss, threat, or challenge; responses were scored for 28 specific coping mechanisms and 2 broad coping factors. Cross-sectional analyses showed evidence of age or cohort differences in the use of several coping mechanisms, but none of these effects was consistently paralleled by changes in repeated measures and cross-sequential analyses. These findings suggest that aging has little effect on coping behavior in a community-dwelling sample. Retest correlations demonstrated modest stability of individual differences in most coping mechanisms, suggesting that coping responses are in part a function of enduring characteristics of the individual.\r"

In Experiment 1 of the study, 115 young adults rated each of 28 memory failure vignettes on a 7-point seriousness scale. Mrs. X, the target person in the vignettes, was described either as age 30 or 70. Vignettes in the more serious category were rated, as expected, more stringently than vignettes in the less serious category. Also, the young subjects rated Mrs. X age 70 more stringently than Mrs. X age 30, regardless of the seriousness level of the vignettes. In Experiment 2, 79 older adults evaluated the same vignettes, again with Mrs. X either age 30 or 70. Again, vignettes in the more serious category were rated more stringently than vignettes in the less serious category. However, older adults rated Mrs. X age 30 and Mrs. X age 70 equivalently. In a final overall analysis, older adults were more lenient than the young in memory failure judgments, and their differential leniency was most apparent in judgments of the serious vignettes.\r"

Among the significant decline models, there is disagreement regarding which functions are affected and to what degree, and at what point in the normal life span such a decline becomes significant. This study examined the neuropsychological test performance of 86 adults with no objective evidence of brain dysfunction. Significant decline, beginning as early as the 30s or 40s, was seen on all measures except the simple motor task of finger tapping. These results are viewed as supporting a model of differential decline of specific functions nested within a general decline model.\r"

From these data the number of completely recalled sequences was computed, as well as global and stop transitional error probabilities (TEPs). Older adults recalled fewer correct letter sequences than did the young adults, but the global and stop TEP data indicated that both age groups were chunking the four-letter sequences into two sets of two letters. Thus, the present study indicates that there are no age differences in primary organization, but that older adults exhibit an age deficit in serial recall.\r"

As participants in a statewide panel study, more than 200 older adults were interviewed both before and after two distinct floods occurred in southeastern Kentucky in 1981 and 1984. Exposure to these incidents, which differed in overall intensity, was assessed at both the individual and community levels. Personal loss was associated with short-term increases in negative affect, limited to one year postflood. Longer-term effects were more dependent on the level of community destruction. Exposure to high levels of community destruction was related to decreased positive affect up to two years postdisaster, whereas exposure to high levels of both community destruction and personal loss was predictive of increased negative affect for two years.\r"

The variation in age-specific rates with age was similar for all cancers, as demonstrated by large positive correlation coefficients between age-incidence patterns averaged over all populations. In addition, the age-incidence patterns for bronchus and stomach cancer were similar and essentially invariant over time. The variation in age-standardized rates among the populations was not similar for all cancers, as demonstrated by correlation coefficients that were small in some cases and negative in others. Between bronchus and stomach cancer, age-standardized rates varied in opposite directions from 1960 to 1975. It is obvious, therefore, that the cause for the variation in age-specific rates with age is not related to the cause for the variation in age-standardized rates among populations or over time. The shape of age-incidence patterns for the cancers studied must be determined by a factor that is common to the tissues of tumor origin, and invariant among populations and over time. The intrinsic aging process is the most reasonable candidate for this role.\r"

They further predict that, by that time, more than half the U.S. population will be over the age of 40. Along with this dynamic change in the underlying age structure of the population comes an increasing body of evidence which supports the correlation between chronological age of the host and incidence of a variety of human cancers. Not only does cancer affect the older age group in a disproportionate manner but, as we have already noted, our nation's number of older individuals is increasing. In 1900, the number of individuals over 65 years of age was 3.1 million. By 2030 this number is expected to reach 55 million. Hence, there will be an increasing need for cancer treatment and cancer care among the older segment of the population. This chapter addresses some of the issues of the modeling and the simulation of the interplay of aging normal tissues and cancer processes. We will illustrate some simply preliminary results and will show how these might be extended to address some of the more complex questions arising in this intriguing interface.\r"

When adequate inhibition of acid secretion is achieved even the most refractory ulcer heal, although rapid recurrence upon cessation of therapy belies the non-curative nature of the therapy. Despite the critical necessity for acid and the association with increased acid secretion in some patients, ulcers reflect a focal disturbance in mucosal defense. Once a discrete ulcer has formed, the disruption of mucosal architecture by the ulcer and the presence of an intense surrounding inflammatory response will impair locally the ability of the mucosa to defend itself against injury. Several of the mechanisms hypothesized to be involved in mucosal defense are responsive to prostaglandins (e.g., mucus and bicarbonate secretion, and blood flow). However, these mechanisms may not be critical variables to the healing of ordinary peptic ulcers because synthetic prostaglandins which stimulate these defensive mechanisms, heal ordinary peptic ulcers with an effectiveness predicted from their antisecretory potential. Although one could therefore hypothesize that prostaglandin modulation of mucosal defense is not a relevant concept in humans, it is possible that prostaglandins fail to enhance the healing of peptic ulcers because the targets for their effects on mucosal defense (e.g., epithelial cells and normal mucosal vasculature) are disrupted in the vicinity of the ulcer. Mucosal defense may be impaired by the inhibition of prostaglandin production via nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or may be secondary to the gastroduodenitis found with Campylobacter pylori infection, although causal relationships in the latter instance remain controversial.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several factors associated with ulcer recurrence have been identified but pathogenetic mechanisms are obscure. Some recent studies suggest that the type of treatment used to heal the initial ulcer influences the propensity to recurrence. Although there is circumstantial evidence that relapse may be accelerated after initial treatment with H2-receptor antagonists, overall it appears that differences in recurrence rates are more likely due to the influence of colloidal bismuth subcitrate in reducing recurrence rates. Several mucosal abnormalities have been identified in patients with peptic ulcer disease in remission. These include defective gastric mucus, reduced duodenal bicarbonate secretion and altered synthesis of certain prostaglandins, particularly of the E series. Decreased salivary secretion of epidermal growth factor and gastric Campylobacter pylori infections have also received much attention recently. It is postulated that the cause of recurrent ulceration, like that of initial ulceration, is multifactorial, and that local factors caused by the initial ulcer may contribute to the propensity of recurrence.\r"

A small minority of people may have other factors causing their gastritis, bile reflux, or anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, CP causes temporary dyspeptic symptoms when an individual receives an acute infection for the first time, but what is much less certain is whether or not CP is responsible for chronic dyspeptic symptoms, and whether eradication of CP will improve dyspepsia.

Although we have been able to culture C. pylori for only about 5 years, what we now know about this organism can explain many mysteries surrounding peptic ulcer disease. Whenever one investigates a population of ulcer patients for the presence of any accepted potentially important pathogenetic factors, one finds that the population of patients with duodenal ulcer disease differs (statistically) from those without duodenal ulcer disease, but that to a large degree they also overlap. None of the traditional factors can be considered essential and characteristic of chronic duodenal ulcer. The exception is the presence of a C. pylori infection, the presence of which is almost invariable. Several properties of C. pylori have been identified that might be virulence factors, including (a) provoking a marked acute and chronic inflammatory response, (b) rapid motility through gastric mucus, (c) urease activity, (d) a fibrillar adhesin(s), (e) several putative exotoxins, and (f) microinvasion. We can now add to the old dictum \"no acid-no ulcer,\" \"no C. pylori-no ulcer\" at least as far as chronic duodenal ulcer disease in adults is concerned.\r"

  ".W": "Several proteins that are anchored to the surface of T lymphocytes via a phosphatidylinositol (PI) moiety can initiate cell stimulation upon cross-linking. Inasmuch as these proteins do not traverse the plasma membrane, it is not clear how they are capable of signaling across the membrane. Herein we report two distinct sets of experiments that examine the consequence of cross-linking PI-anchored molecules on murine T cells. We first analyzed the fate of antibody cross-linked TAP (Ly-6A.2) and Thy-1 molecules on T-T hybrids. Using an assay to measure receptor-mediated endocytosis, an intracellular accumulation of 125I labeled anti-TAP and anti-Thy-1 mAb was documented that was specific and Ag dependent. The internalization of these molecules was confirmed by cytotoxicity assays using antibody-toxin conjugates, and electron microscopic studies. Although the PI-anchored proteins lack a cytoplasmic domain that is necessary for the internalization of many receptors, they nevertheless can be induced to enter the cell upon cross-linking. The rate of entry of cross-linked TAP and Thy-1 into cells was shown to be 10 and 2% per hour, respectively, which is considerably less than that observed for the transferrin receptor or TCR/CD3 complex. To assess whether the internalization of TAP and Thy-1 might be of importance in their ability to stimulate T cells, we attempted to cross-link these molecules under conditions where the mAb or its cross-linked complex can not enter the cell. We observed that anti-TAP and anti-Thy-1 mAb conjugated to a cell impermeant matrix fail to stimulate T cells. This loss of stimulatory activity was observed with multiple T-T hybridomas and mAb over a wide titration of antibody concentration and was independent of the mAb isotype. Results from experiments with anti-Ig cross-linking of the mAb-PI anchored protein complex suggested that the loss of T cell stimulation upon mAb immobilization is not simply due to an alteration in the degree of antibody cross-linking. These findings were generalized to three distinct PI-anchored proteins: TAP, Thy-1, and Ly6C on normal T cells. When the same cells were stimulated through the TCR/CD3 complex, only immobilized mAb are stimulatory. These results demonstrate a marked difference in the cross-linking requirements for stimulating T cells through PI-anchored molecules in contrast to the transmembrane TCR complex. Furthermore, these findings raise the possibility that molecular internalization of Ab-PI-anchored complexes may be necessary in signaling through these molecules.\r"

Furthermore, the generation of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes was markedly inhibited by CsA treatment, whereas the development of CD3-, CD4-CD8+ thymocytes and TCR-gamma delta-bearing, CD4-CD8- thymocytes was not affected. These results suggest that CsA induces a maturational arrest of T cells entirely within the thymic environment, and indicate that CsA-induced inhibition occurs at more than one stage of intrathymic T cell development.\r"

This study was undertaken in order to identify residues within the p120-131 sequence which either interact with the TCR termed epitopic residues or interact with MHC class II molecules termed agretopic residues. For this purpose a panel of analogs of p120-131 composed of peptides containing single alanine substitutions for each residue was synthesized. These peptides were analyzed functionally for their ability to stimulate p120-131 or HBcAg-primed T cells and for their immunogenicity in B10.S or [B10.S X B10 (nonresponder)]F1 mice. Furthermore, analogs of p120-131 were used as stimulators and inhibitors of T cell activation in competitive inhibition experiments. Cumulatively these functional studies allowed us to identify residue 125 as a dominant epitopic residue and residues 127 and 129 as dominant agretopic residues. Furthermore, a p120-131 analog containing an alanine substitution for the dominant agretopic residue was immunogenic in B10.S mice, but was nonimmunogenic in (B10.S X B10)F1 mice indicating that T cell responsiveness is influenced by MHC class II gene dosage effects and can be inherited in an apparent recessive manner. In this study, critical residues involved in the immunogenicity of this dominant T cell determinant of HBcAg were defined, in a companion study, the influence of these residues on tolerogenicity was examined.\r"

  ".W": "One purpose of this study was to examine the concept of T cell immunodominance employing a neonatal tolerance model. The extent to which a single T cell recognition site can represent the total T cell response to hepatitis B core Ag (HBcAg) was examined in the B10.S and B10 murine strains. It was shown that the entire B10.S T cell response to HBcAg was focused on a single immunodominant site represented by residues 120-131. This was demonstrated by exposing B10.S neonatal mice to p120-140 or p120-131, which resulted in a state of T cell tolerance to the entire HBcAg. In contrast, p120-140 contained an immunogenic T cell site for B10 mice, p129-140, but this site was nontolerogenic. Similarly, injection of p120-140 into (B10.S X B10)F1 neonatal mice resulted in tolerization of p120-131-specific, I-As-restricted T cells, but not of p129-140-specific, I-Ab-restricted T cells. The second purpose of this study was to attempt to explain the immunologic basis of an immunogenic yet nontolerogenic T cell determinant. It was shown that the p120-131 T cell site, which is immunogenic and tolerogenic in B10.S mice, could be converted into an immunogenic/nontolerogenic T cell site by a single amino acid substitution in either residue 127 or 129. Residues 127 and 129 were previously shown to be involved in interaction with MHC class II molecules (agretopic). These results demonstrated that the relative avidity of a peptide-MHC interaction can influence T cell tolerance induction. Furthermore, the results suggest that a higher threshold of peptide-MHC avidity may be required to induce T cell tolerance as compared to the threshold of peptide-MHC avidity required to immunize T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Apamin is a single-chain, disulfide-bonded, 18-amino acid peptide that elicits mouse T cell responses when presented by cells expressing syngeneic Ad or Ab class II MHC molecules. We previously showed that both the unfolding of this peptide by APC and the integrity of its N terminus segment were required for efficient apamin T cell recognition. To seek further information on the sites through which this peptide interacts with Ia and/or TCR, we used a panel of Ad- or Ab-restricted, apamin-specific THC to probe the antigenicity of a series of synthetic apamin analogs. These included peptides either truncated at the N terminus, or substituted by Ala at position 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 10. Analysis of THC responses to apamin analogs and use of the latter in competition assays for peptide presentation revealed the following: 1) optimal apamin T cell recognition critically involved Lys4, Ala5, Pro6, Glu7, and Leu10. The role of these residues in either \"Ia or TCR binding regions\" was found to depend upon the restricting Ia molecules at play. Thus, Lys4, Glu7, and Leu10 were TCR-binding residues in both Ad- and Ab-apamin complexes, whereas Lys4 participated in apamin/Ab but not, or to a marginal extent, in apamin/Ad interaction. Furthermore, Pro6 was associated either with an Ia contact region or a TCR interaction site when apamin was presented by Ab or Ad molecules, respectively. Unfolded apamin and the unrelated chicken OVA323-339 peptide were found to bind to the same, or closely related site(s) of Ad, as shown by their ability to compete reciprocally for recognition by appropriate Ad-restricted THC. Four distinct TCR V beta genes (V beta 2, V beta 4, V beta 6, and V beta 8) were found to be used in our panel of 16 apamin-specific THC. These data indicate that apamin interacts with Ad or TCR through a motif resembling other beta-sheeted, Ad-binding sequences; however, based on the spacing of the critical residues (i.e., 4, 7, and 10), the possibility exists that apamin processing permits the folding of this sequence into an alpha-helix.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid modulation exerts a beneficial effect in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, the effects of essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency on the heterologous phase of nephrotoxic nephritis in rats (induced by the injection of a rabbit antiglomerular basement membrane antibody) were studied. The heterologous phase of nephrotoxic nephritis was characterized by an invasion of leukocytes into the glomerulus. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils predominated early on (3 h), whereas macrophages predominated at 24 and 72 h. EFA deficiency selectively prevented the influx of macrophages into the glomerulus. The invasion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, in contrast, was unaffected. The influx of leukocytes into the glomerulus during nephritis was accompanied by a marked enhancement (10- to 40-fold) in glomerular thromboxane and leukotriene B4 production. EFA deficiency largely attenuated this change. Renal dysfunction during the heterologous phase of nephritis was manifested as azotemia, polyuria, sodium retention, and proteinuria. With EFA deficiency, polyuria, azotemia, and sodium retention were not seen. Proteinuria was reduced by approximately 85%. To address whether the lack of macrophage migration into the glomerulus in the context of nephritis with EFA deficiency might be due to a functional defect in macrophage migration, the chemotactic responsiveness of EFA-deficient macrophages was examined. EFA-deficient macrophages displayed normal chemotactic migration toward activated C. In sum, EFA deficiency prevents the invasion of macrophages into the glomerulus in nephrotoxic nephritis and attenuates the accompanying metabolic and functional alterations, but does not affect macrophage chemotactic responsiveness. Alterations in macrophage elicitation and lipid mediator generation by inflamed glomeruli thus appear to be central to the salutary effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid modification on glomerulonephritis.\r"

The cells resulting from treatment with IL-3 were multi-nucleated and demonstrated tartrate-resistant acid-phosphatase activity, as do resident osteoclasts found in bone. IL-3-induced osteoclast-like cell development in the absence of serum-derived vitamin D metabolites, and a mAb that inhibited IL-3-induced proliferation of an addicted cell line also inhibited the development of osteoclasts in the presence of IL-3. The same Ab had no effect on 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced differentiation of osteoclasts. This newly described function of IL-3 may indicate a role for activated T cells in the bone resorption seen with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

P48 is a cytokine recently identified in the supernatant of the human null cell leukemia cell line Reh, which induces differentiation and cytolytic activity in HL-60 cells. P48 has been purified to homogeneity and is distinct from TNF-alpha TNF-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and macrophage CSF. In the present study we examined the ability of P48 to stimulate cytokine release by human peripheral blood monocytes. P48 stimulated the secretion of TNF and IL-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Priming the monocytes with IFN-gamma enhanced P48-induced cytokine release but was not a requirement for secretion. Cytokine secretion was in response to P48 and was not caused by endotoxin contamination. The cytokine-inducing activity of P48 was extremely sensitive to heat treatment but could not be eliminated by using polymyxin B. Polyclonal antisera to P48 completely blocked the cytokine-inducing activity. P48 may be an important new member of the cytokine network involved in the regulation of cytokine secretion by monocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90038475\r", 
  ".W": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 is a polypeptide that is assumed to play a fundamental role in the growth of both normal and neoplastic cells. TGF-beta 2 is a closely related polypeptide, originally described as glioblastoma cell-derived T cell suppressor factor (G-TsF) due to its immunosuppressive activity. Expression of the genes for TGF-beta 1 and G-TsF/TGF-beta 2 was examined in tumor cells and was found to be different in several cell lines and tissues that were tested. Whereas two glioblastoma cell lines expressed both TGF-beta 1 and G-TsF/TGF-beta 2 mRNA, one melanoma and neuroblastoma cell lines showed only TGF-beta 1 mRNA which in the case of the neuroblastoma required cycloheximide treatment for its detection. The coordinate expression of the genes for TGF-beta 1 and G-TsF/TGF-beta 2 in glioblastoma was not paralleled by secretion of both polypeptides as only G-TsF/TGF-beta 2 but not TGF-beta 1 was identified in supernatants of glioblastoma cells. These data provide evidence for a post-transcriptional level of regulation for production of the two forms of TGF-beta. As mRNA for G-TsF/TGF-beta 2 was also identified in fresh surgically removed human glioblastoma tissue, G-TsF/TGF-beta 2 may also be secreted within the tumor in vivo. Unlike glioblastoma, human fetal brain tissues or adult brain specimens studied did not express detectable levels of TGF-beta mRNA. Impaired cell-mediated immunity is an established finding in patients with glioblastoma. Secretion of G-TsF/TGF-beta 2 by tumor cells in vivo may contribute to decreased immune surveillance for tumor development, as well as neovascularization of the tumor tissue.\r"

Starting on the day of infection, i.p. injections of 1 microgram/day or rTGF-beta 1 or rG-TsF/TGF-beta 2 suppressed the generation of virus specific CTL. The effect of TGF-beta on CTL (day 8) was less pronounced when TGF-beta treatment was delayed for 3 days after LCMV infection. rG-TsF/TGF-beta 2 also has an inhibiting effect on CTL-mediated disease in LCMV-infected mice: it prolonged the survival time of mice infected with LCMV and reduced the local swelling reaction after infection into the footpad. These results indicate that rTGF-beta 1 and rG-TsF/TGF-beta 2 influence T cell immune reactivity in vivo.\r"

A mAb, RM-5, which binds an epitope on the receptor which is distinct from the IL-1 binding site has been produced in rats. RM-5 has been used to immunoprecipitate the IL-1R from 32P-orthophosphate labeled CHO cells which express approximately 100,000 functional, murine rIL-1R/cell. Phosphorylation of the receptor was observed as early as 1 min after the addition of IL-1 and continued for periods of up to 30 min. Phosphorylation increases as the concentration of IL-1 increases from 10(-13) to 10(-8) M. Potassium hydroxide hydrolysis of the phosphorylated IL-1R shows that more than 90% of the phosphate is incorporated into serine or threonine. Thus, one of the earliest events after IL-1 binding to the IL-1R is activation of a serine/threonine protein kinase and phosphorylation of the IL-1R itself.\r"

  ".W": "Both IL-3 and IL-4 have multi-CSF activity on early marrow progenitors. We have examined the effect of IL-3 and IL-4 on the differentiation of NK cells from their marrow-derived precursors and have further examined the interactions of these cytokines with IL-2 and IL-1. We tested marrow which had been depleted of mature cells and of E rosette-positive cells (including NK cells) by treatment with soybean lectin and SRBC (SBA-E-BM). The cytolytic activities of the SBA-E-BM samples were tested in 51Cr-release assays after 7 days of liquid culture. K562 targets were used as a measure of NK activity and NK-resistant Daudi targets were used to measure lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity. Neither NK nor LAK activity was detectable in marrow cultured in medium without cytokines, or in medium containing IL-3, or IL-4 alone. Both of these cytokines were shown to be inhibitory to the IL-2-induced generation of NK and LAK activity from SBA-E-BM at concentrations as low as 1 U/ml. The inhibitory activity of both IL-3 and IL-4 was found to occur early in the marrow cultures, with little or no inhibitory effects seen if added 48 h after IL-2. IL-3 appeared to be specifically inhibitory to NK cell precursors since addition of IL-3 to cultures of PBMC did not inhibit IL-2-induced lytic activities. In contrast, IL-4 was equally inhibitory to the activation of marrow and peripheral blood NK cells by IL-2. Mixing experiments demonstrated that the reduced lytic activity in IL-3 or IL-4 containing marrow cultures were not due to suppression of the NK effectors, nor could marrow cultured in IL-3 or IL-4 serve as targets for IL-2-activated NK cells. Phenotype analysis of the lymphoid cells in marrow cultures containing IL-2 combined with IL-3 or IL-4 revealed fewer cells expressing Leu-11 (CD16), or Leu-19 (CD56) and fewer CD16, CD56 coexpressing cells compared with marrow cultured in medium containing IL-2 alone. The inhibitory activity of IL-4, but not IL-3, could be partially reversed if IL-1 was added to the cultures, suggesting that IL-1 and IL-4 have opposing activities on NK cells responsiveness to IL-2. These interactions between cytokines might be important in the regulation of NK cell differentiation and on the functional activity of mature NK cells.\r"

  ".W": "Murine resident peritoneal macrophages (PM) were refractory to activation for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of SRBC targets as compared with either oil or thioglycollate-elicited inflammatory macrophages. Western blot analysis of macrophage cellular lysates indicated a direct correlation between the endogenous C1q levels and their innate response to activation for ADCC. Inflammatory PM had 7- to 14-fold higher C1q levels (ca. 23 to 45 ng C1q/100 micrograms protein) than resident PM (ca. 3 ng C1q/100 micrograms protein) as determined by densitometric scanning of blots. Purified exogenous mouse or human C1q were found to reconstitute the response of resident PM for ADCC mediated by C-activating mouse IgG2a or IgG2b mAb, but not by non-C-activating IgG1. Thioglycollate-elicited PM with highest endogenous C1q levels were unaffected by exogenous C1q, whereas oil-elicited PM with intermediate C1q levels were slightly augmented in their ADCC response by exogenous C1q. Augmentation of the resident PM response for ADCC activation was accomplished by either coincubation of effector macrophages with physiologic concentrations of C1q (0.5 to 4.0 micrograms/ml), IgG, and SRBC targets or by IgG and C1q preopsonized targets. FcR-dependent phagocytosis by resident PM was similarly reconstituted by exogenous C1q. The results indicate that resident macrophages with low potential for C1q biosynthesis and secretion were reconstituted by exogenous C1q in their FcR-dependent phagocytosis and ADCC, whereas inflammatory macrophages with sufficient endogenous C1q levels were largely unaffected. Thus C1q appears to have a pivotal mechanistic role in the initiation of macrophage activation for FcR-dependent effector functions.\r"

Freshly isolated human PBMC were stimulated with either PHA, anti-CD3 + phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), or with a combination of ionomycin + PDBu. MGF, pTGF-beta 1, and pTGF-beta 2 decreased mitogen-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation by 30 to 75% in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum degree of inhibition was obtained at 1 ng/ml (40 pM) and could not be increased by increasing the concentration of teh transforming growth factor 10-fold. Stimulation of fresh T cells with the recall Ag tetanus toxoid was also inhibited (85%) by MGF at pM concentrations as was the proliferation of a human T cell clone specific for purified protein derivative. The effects of MGF and pTGF-beta 1 on anti-CD3-mediated increase of intracellular Ca2+ (Cai2+) was investigated by using the Fura-2 method. Neither MGF nor pTGF-beta 1 inhibited this increase in Cai2+ induced by a mitogenic concentration of anti-CD3 antibody. In order to determine whether TGF-beta preferentially inhibited the CD4+ or CD8+ subpopulation of human T cells, a limiting dilution analysis system, which allows every T cell to proliferate, was used. pTGF-beta 1 at a concentration of 5 ng/ml decreased the frequency of proliferating T cell precursors of both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets to a similar extent. Furthermore, MGF, pTGF-beta 1, and pTGF-beta 2 also decreased IL-2 mediated [3H]thymidine incorporation into human PBL Con A blasts and the IL-4-mediated [3H]thymidine incorporation of purified T lymphocytes costimulated with PDBu by 70%. In conclusion, bovine MGF exerts suppressive effects on human T cells stimulated with Ag, mitogens, or interleukins, and the degree of T cell suppression is similar (or identical) to those of pTGF-beta 1 or -beta 2.\r"

The occupancy of CD16 by aggregated IgG on large granular lymphocytes induces expression of activation markers, release of inflammatory mediators and triggering of effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Recently we and others described that CD16 is anchored to the membrane of granulocytes via a phosphatidylinositol glycan moiety. Here we show that the CD16 molecule expressed on NK cells, cultured monocytes, and lung macrophages is not phosphatidylinositol glycan moiety anchored. It is not released with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, and after removal of N-linked carbohydrate is 5 to 7 kDa larger than the granulocyte CD16 molecule, strongly suggesting the presence of transmembrane and cytoplasmic protein domains. Redirected killing of hybridoma targets expressing anti-CD16 surface Ig shows that NK cell CD16 is unable to do so. These findings demonstrate that NK cell and granulocyte CD16 have different membrane anchors and indicate that the type of membrane anchor is an important biologic mechanism for regulating the functional capacity of surface receptors.\r"

It was found that unrelated good I-Ed binders share structurally similar \"core\" regions that were experimentally demonstrated to be crucial for binding to I-Ed molecules. Single amino acid substitution analogues of one good I-Ed binder, hen egg lysozyme 107-116, were analyzed for their capacity to bind to I-Ed molecules and to activate two different I-Ed-restricted T cell hybridomas. The results illustrate the great permissiveness of I-Ed-peptide interaction and the great specificity of T cell recognition. It was concluded from these analyses that basic residues on the peptide molecule play a crucial role in binding to I-Ed. This contrasts with the structural requirements for binding to the other Iad isotype, I-Ad, the crucial hydrophobic residues. Thus, different class II molecules of the same MHC haplotype may have rather distinct peptide binding specificities, thereby expanding the repertoire of possible immunogenic peptides presented for T cell recognition.\r"

  ".W": "The decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is a cell membrane glycoprotein that functions in the control of C activation. We studied the modulation of membrane DAF on polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) by using anti-DAF antibodies. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that DAF expression was reduced by 43 +/- 7% on resting or stimulated cells that were held at 37 degrees C for 30 min when compared with those kept on ice. Most of this reduction occurred within the first 15 min, and was followed by a gradual further decrease in surface DAF. PMN that were held at 37 degrees C for varying periods of time before DAF measurement had a gradual decrease suggestive of release of DAF from the PMN membrane or endocytosis. To examine the latter, PMN were reacted with anti-DAF at 0 degree C, followed by 125I-Fab'2 secondary antibodies at either 0 degree C or 37 degrees C, and subsequently treated with pronase. Thirty +/- 11% of the 125I remained bound to cells kept at 37 degrees C compared to 2% in those held at 0 degrees C. Internalization was further confirmed by electron microscopy. In PMN that were not exposed to pronase, 26 +/- 2% of the surface-associated 125I was released at 37 degrees C compared with 7% at 0 degrees C. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE of surface-labeled PMN showed that the temperature-dependent released DAF had a lower m.w. than membrane DAF. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that 37 degrees C mediated the redistribution of DAF from a homogeneous pattern into caps. These results show that under the conditions studied DAF is partially internalized and partially released from the PMN membrane to the fluid phase; the latter may contribute to the presence of DAF in body fluids.\r"

Both Ag were found to be expressed on the same cells in normal tissues, and on the same cell lines when a large panel was analyzed. The Ag are both phosphorylated and have identical m.w., which may vary in different cell types because of differences in glycosylation. Immunoprecipitation of pre-B cell lysates with the BP-1 antibody removed the 6C3-reactive molecules and vice versa. However, the 6C3 antibody did not inhibit binding of the BP-1 antibody to viable cells and, in fact, enhanced immunofluorescence staining was observed when both antibodies were added together. These results indicate that the BP-1 and 6C3 antibodies react with different epitopes on the same molecule that is expressed in relatively low levels on normal early B lineage cells, and in relatively high levels on most neoplastic pre-B cells, pre-B cells in long term bone marrow cultures and certain stromal cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effects of the cytokines IL-1 and TNF-alpha on the transendothelial migration of neutrophils, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown to confluence on connective tissue prepared from human amniotic membrane. Pretreatment of HUVEC-amnion cultures with rIL-1 beta (7.5 ng/ml) or rTNF-alpha (5 ng/ml) for 4 h resulted in rapid migration of from 20 to 50% of subsequently added neutrophils across the endothelial monolayer. In contrast, only 3 +/- 3% of added neutrophils penetrated the HUVEC monolayer in the absence of any stimulus. The number of neutrophils that migrated across cytokine-treated HUVEC was similar to the number that traversed untreated monolayers in response to gradients of FMLP; in addition, it was only 35% less than the number of neutrophils that migrated in response to leukotriene B4. No consistent additive effect was seen when migration was induced by both cytokine pretreatment of the HUVEC and a chemotactic gradient. The number of neutrophils that migrated across IL-1-treated cultures was proportional to the number added over the range of 2.5 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(6) neutrophils. When used at optimal concentrations, IL-1 and TNF-alpha were equally effective in stimulating neutrophil migration; no additive effect was seen when HUVEC were pretreated with optimal doses of both cytokines together. Direct addition of IL-1 or TNF-alpha to a 1-h migration assay had no effect on neutrophil adhesion to or migration across HUVEC, either in the presence or absence of a chemotactic gradient. Stimulation of neutrophil transendothelial migration in this system did not appear to be caused by adsorption of cytokine by the amniotic tissue, nor was it due to contamination of the cytokine preparations by LPS. These results suggest that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, generated at sites of inflammation, may act upon the endothelium to promote emigration of neutrophils from the vasculature.\r"

  ".U": "90038489\r", 
  ".W": "Upon stimulation with C5a, TNF, or phorbol dibutyrate (PDB), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) exhibit first an increase then a decrease in adhesion to unstimulated endothelial cells (EC). Essentially all of this adhesion is mediated by the CD18 family of leukocyte integrins on PMN. To determine the individual roles of CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), CD11b/CD18 (CR3, Mac-1) and CD11c/CD18 (p150,95) in adhesion of PDB-stimulated PMN to unstimulated EC, mAb against the CD11 chains were used. mAb against CD11a or CD11b each blocked adhesion of PMN to EC by approximately 50%, but mAb against CD11c had no effect. Inasmuch as a combination of anti-CD11a and CD11b mAb completely blocked adhesion, it appears that CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 make approximately equal contributions to binding, and CD11c does not participate. Anti-CD11a or CD11b each blocked adhesion by about 50% throughout the transient time course of PDB-stimulated adhesion, indicating that the capacity of each of these receptors to bind EC is transiently activated by PDB. We next examined the role of ICAM-1 on EC as a ligand for CD18. Two anti-ICAM-1 mAb (LB-2 and 84H10) each inhibited PMN adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching a maximal inhibition of approximately 50%. Anti-ICAM-1 mAb blocked the CD11a/CD18-dependent portion of adhesion because concomitant use of anti-CD11a and anti-ICAM-1 did not cause additive inhibition. In contrast, anti-CD11b plus anti-ICAM-1 resulted in complete blockade of adhesion. This result suggests that CD11a/CD18 recognizes ICAM-1 on EC, but CD11b/CD18 recognizes a different ligand(s). To determine if CD11b CD18 has the ability to recognize ICAM-1, human macrophages were plated on culture surfaces coated with purified ICAM-1. Interaction of CD11a/CD18 with the surface-bound ICAM-1 resulted in selective down-modulation of CD11a/CD18 from the apical portion of the macrophages. In contrast, ICAM-1-coated surfaces did not down-modulate CD11b/CD18. The data suggest that CD11b/CD18 does not recognize ICAM-1, and that this receptor functions in adhesion of PMN to EC by recognizing novel ligand(s) on EC.\r"

  ".W": "Monocytes and tissue macrophages play important roles in host defense against virus infections and, in the case of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and HIV, may also be the reservoir for latent disease. Because these cells can also rapidly respond to most infections by secretion of inflammatory mediators, we were interested in determining if HCMV infection could have a direct activating effect on macrophage cytokine production. To do this, we primarily investigated the influence of HCMV infection on IL-1 beta-mRNA expression in peripheral blood monocytes and the promyelocytic cell line, ML-3 as well as the inflammatory response genes TNF-alpha, MAD-9, MAD-6, and MAD-2 in the promyelocytic ML-3 cell line. Exposure of ML-3 cells to the virus prior to induction of differentiation had little influence on mediator gene expression. However, induction of the macrophage phenotype by pretreatment of ML-3 cells with the phorbol ester, PMA, followed by HCMV challenge, resulted in a greatly extended period of expression of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, MAD-9, and CSF-1 but not MAD-6 and MAD-2. Constitutively expressed genes such as lysozyme and actin were not similarly modulated. Both RNA dot-blot and in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that infection of human peripheral blood monocytes with HCMV leads to sustained expression of IL-1 beta mRNA for up to 96 h, which contrasted markedly with mock-infected or LPS-stimulated monocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of the intracellular levels of IL-1 beta protein in ML-3 cells indicated that not only was there more protein produced in infected cells, but that the majority of the cells had responded. Enhanced levels of the intracellular form of IL-1 beta in monocytes was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Cotransfection experiments were performed using IL-1 beta-CAT chimeric plasmids together with plasmids encoding HCMV-immediate-early gene region products. Transactivation of the IL-1 beta gene by region 2 of the immediate-early gene was observed in ML-3 cells that had been induced to differentiate prior to transfection. No stimulation of IL-1 beta promoter activity was observed in ML-3 cells that were undifferentiated prior to transfection. In summary, HCMV infection, although not leading to productive infection, nonetheless may contribute to the pathology of the infection through enhancement of monocyte inflammatory mediator gene expression with subsequent stimulation of protein synthesis.\r"

In the current study, antiserum to infective third-stage larvae of Brugia malayi was used to select potentially protective Ag shared by microfilariae (mf) and adult worms. A major Ag of 97 kDa (Bm 97) was identified by immunoblotting and isolated by electroelution. Immunization of mice with 2 micrograms electroeluted Bm 97 induced partial resistance to subsequent i.v. challenge with live B. malayi mf (40 to 60% reduction in parasitemia compared to controls, p less than 0.05). Immunoblot studies of B. malayi mf and adult worm lysates showed reactivity of a 97-kDa molecule with monospecific antiserum to Schistosoma mansoni paramyosin. In addition, mouse antibody to Bm 97 reacted with a 97-kDa molecule contained in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans but not in two mutant strains deficient for paramyosin. Subcutaneous injection of mice with paramyosin (5 micrograms twice at a 2-wk interval) purified from C. elegans or B. malayi by salt precipitation induced resistance to microfilaremia (21 to 60% lower intensities than controls, p less than 0.01). These data indicate that the invertebrate muscle protein paramyosin enhances clearance of blood-borne stages of lymphatic filariae. Examination of the ability of paramyosin to induce resistance in third-stage larvae-challenged hosts is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "The HLA-Aw19 complex consists of a number of serologically cross-reactive Ag (i.e., A29, A30, A31, A32, and Aw33) which exhibit an epitope shared by HLA-B and -C proteins. To investigate the structural basis for these serologic cross-reactivities, we have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequences for A30, A31, and Aw33, and compared the predicted amino acid sequences with those already available for A29, A32, and other class I allelic products. All alleles of the Aw19 group contained A-locus-specific sequences, exhibiting \"A-ness.\" The structural similarities between Aw19 polypeptides were found in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains, where shared amino acid residues were identified that correlated with observed serological reactivity patterns. Seven Aw19-specific nucleotides were found. Two of these were silent substitutions, but the remaining five resulted in Aw19-specific amino acid residues. Each of the HLA-A alleles can be classified into one of the five serologically cross-reacting groups. In the Aw19 group, the alleles A29, A31, A32, and Aw33 are closely related serologically as well as genetically whereas A30 probably belongs to the A1/A3/A11 group. The similarity between A30 and the other Aw19 alleles may have resulted from two independent gene conversions affecting exons 2 and 3. Additional mutations or gene conversion-like events in A30 were also noted. It is postulated that gene conversions have played a significant role in the divergence of the Aw19 alleles. However, each serologically cross-reactive Aw19 allotype appears to have arisen directly from a common ancestral allele. A30 was the only exception, and this allele may represent an unusual allotype, which is subject to a high rate of genetic changes, as is seen in the H-2Kb gene of the mouse.\r"

  ".W": "Ag recognition by most T lymphocytes is mediated by clonally distributed alpha beta heterodimeric receptors. A major fraction of TCR diversity is believed to be due to the random coexpression in individual T cells of the products of independently rearranging alpha- and beta-genes (combinatorial diversity). However, analysis of cell surface receptors on transfected T hybridoma cells synthesizing various sets of alpha- and beta-chains revealed marked differences in the efficiency of expression of certain alpha beta-pairs. Specifically, using the functionally rearranged gene products of the 2B4 cytochrome c specific T hybridoma (V beta 3, V alpha 11.2) and BW5147 parent lymphoma (V beta 1, V alpha BW), a hierarchy of expression efficiency relative to indirectly measured precursor chain levels in the cell was shown to be 2B4 alpha-BW beta greater than 2B4 alpha - 2B4 beta greater than BW alpha - BW beta greater than BW alpha - 2B4 beta. The estimated difference between the best expressed and worst expressed pairs is on the order of 50-fold. For the beta-chain, the primary determinant of expression efficiency with a given alpha-chain appears to be the V segment, as a second V beta 1-chain with distinct D and J regions from BW beta was expressed with the same pattern. These data imply that alpha- and beta-chains do not form well-expressed TCR in a random manner and that limitations on the useful combinatorial association of these chains may significantly affect the functional T cell repertoire.\r"

As these cells mature to medullary thymocytes and peripheral T cells, HLA class I expression increases to a high level. Leukemic T cell lines arrested at various stages of development were used to examine the regulation of HLA class I expression. Nuclear runoff analysis demonstrated that expression differences in these cell lines were the result of a difference in transcription rates. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis with the upstream regulatory region of HLA-A2 as a probe for HLA class I-specific DNA binding proteins indicated that DNA binding activity in the cell extracts paralleled the transcriptional activity of the cells. The predominant DNA binding activity in these T cell lines was mapped, by DNase I protection analysis, to a conserved inverted repeat of the MHC class I enhancer. Thus HLA class I expression in these stage-specific T cell lines correlates with the amount of this enhancer binding activity in these cells suggesting that this commonly found DNA binding factor may, in this system, act to regulate HLA class I expression in a very specific manner.\r"

Previously we reported that murine hind limb amputation induces a rapid and marked impairment of perioperative NK cell cytotoxicity that is associated with increased metastatic activity compared to unmanipulated tumor-bearing controls. Because tumor emboli are systemically discharged in patients undergoing solid tumor resection, we thought it pertinent to begin examining the mechanism underlying the perioperative impairment of murine NK cell cytotoxicity. Studies presented in this report suggest that the mechanism of impairment is multifactorial and includes the surgical stress-induced expansion of splenic erythroblasts that successfully compete with NK cells for YAC-1 target binding sites. In addition, although there is no surgically mediated decrease in splenic NK cell content (as defined morphologically, phenotypically, and functionally), there is an acute decrease in maximal NK cell recycling capacity. An accurate understanding of the mechanisms mediating perioperative impairment of NK cell cytotoxicity may be important in the future development of NK-specific perioperative immunomodulation strategies.\r"

Although these sites are extensively overlapping they can be distinguished on the basis of presentation by distinct class II restriction elements of the murine MHC. Additionally, we present evidence to suggest that a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide which contains both of these T cell sites can stimulate T cell activity in mice of multiple different class II MHC haplotypes, perhaps representing a potential lead for designing a \"universal\" T cell stimulator.\r"

In contrast, lymphocytes activated by dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8) and ionomycin express high affinity receptors; however, no IL-2 synthesis is detectable. Anti-TCR/CD3 antibodies, as well as DiC8 cause translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. In DiC8-stimulated cells translocation of PKC is detectable after 15 min, then it declines to control levels. In lymphocytes activated by antiTCR/CD3 mAb translocation of PKC is detectable after 15 min, then it declines to control levels, followed by a second, long lasting activation of the enzyme up to 4 h. Addition of polyunsaturated fatty acids to DiC8 + ionomycin-treated cells leads to IL-2 synthesis and proliferation. Incorporation of poly-unsaturated fatty acids into plasma membrane phospholipids results in long term activation of PKC. The results suggest that elevated incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and thus continuous activation and translocation of PKC represents a necessary early signal for IL-2 synthesis and proliferation in human lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "90038509\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years, synthetic peptides have been utilized extensively to characterize the minimal essential immunodominant sites on model protein Ag. However, little work has focused on the effect that sequences flanking these minimal recognition sites may exert on T cell recognition. Previous work with staphylococcal nuclease (Nase) demonstrated that I-Ek-restricted clones recognize the peptide 81-100, whereas I-Ab-restricted clones recognize the over-lapping but non-cross-reacting peptide 91-110. Further analysis with 15 or 10 residue peptides within the region 81-110 reveals that the minimal sequence capable of stimulating I-Ek-restricted clones is contained within the decapeptide 91-100. Addition of residues 86-90, to give the peptide 86-100, enhanced the recognition substantially, whereas addition of residues 101-105 produced a 91-105 peptide with no stimulatory ability. These results suggest that interactions between the antigenic peptide 91-100 and residues within the flanking 101-105 sequence have negative consequences for presentation of the immunodominant epitope to T cell clones. Introduction of single amino acid substitutions within 91-105 produced peptides that induce responses comparable to those seen with 91-100. These results are consistent with the suggestion of negative interactions between the minimal immunodominant site and flanking sequences in that single residue substitutions may remove these negative interactions and lead to restoration of stimulatory ability. The negative effect of flanking sequences on T cell recognition of immunodominant sites presents new considerations for development of synthetic vaccines as well as for understanding the biology of Ag processing and presentation.\r"

The results demonstrate that IL-4 can significantly increase the number of maturing B cells which express the Fc epsilon R. This effect was only seen however, on those neonatal B cells which already displayed surface IgD. Splenic B cells which were IgM+, IgD- failed to express the Fc epsilon R when treated with IL-4, even though they responded by increasing their level of class II Ag expression. Further experiments showed that the inability of IgD- immature B cells to express the Fc epsilon R could not be entirely explained by their assignment to the Ly-1 lineage. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-4 can accelerate the developmental expression of the B cell Fc epsilon R, but only on those B cells that are mature enough to express IgD.\r"

  ".W": "MRC OX35, an anti-CD4 mAb, was used to treat high responder Wistar Furth (W/F) (RT1u) and low responder DA (RT1a) rats which had been grafted with directly vascularized hearts from PVG (RT1c) rats across a full MHC plus non-MHC incompatibility. Four doses of mAb at 7 mg/kg given in the first 2 wk postgrafting induced indefinite graft survival (greater than 150 days) in DA hosts, but only delayed rejection to 18 to 42 days in W/F as compared to rejection times of 6 to 8 days in untreated rats. The extension of MRC OX35 treatment to 6 wk in W/F rats induced indefinite graft survival in three of six rats. During treatment MRC OX35 therapy only partially depleted CD4+ cells, and all circulating CD4+ cells were coated with MRC OX35. The capacity of naive CD4+ and CD8+ cells from W/F and DA to be activated to PVG alloantigen was compared both in vitro in an MLC assay and in vivo by an adoptive transfer assay of their capacity to restore rejection of PVG heart grafts in irradiated syngeneic hosts. CD4+ cells from both W/F and DA proliferated in MLC and restored graft rejection. W/F CD8+ cells both proliferated in MLC and restored rejection, but DA CD8+ cells neither proliferated nor reconstituted rejection. Examination of lymphocytes from MRC OX35 treated hosts with long-surviving grafts showed that they were neither depleted of CD4+ T cells nor did they lack the capacity to proliferate to PVG Ag in MLC, this response being similar to that to third-party Ag or by naive lymphocytes. Compared to first-set rejection, PVG skin graft rejection was delayed 2 to 3 days in W/F and 10 to 12 days in DA rats with long-surviving grafts after MRC OX35 therapy, whereas they rejected third-party skin grafts in first-set tempo. These studies show that differences in graft survival in anti-CD4 treated low and high responder strains may be due to the inherent capacity of CD8+ cells to be activated to effect rejection independent of CD4+ cells in W/F but not in DA. In those hosts that accept grafts, there is no evidence of clonal deletion, but there appears to be a form of unresponsiveness akin to that induced in adult rats by other immunosuppressive therapies that protects the graft from rejection.\r"

  ".U": "90038514\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown a novel galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine specific lectin activity (Hodgkin's disease (HD) lectin) on the surface of cultured HD cells (lines L428, its variants, and line L540) to mediate lymphocyte adhesion. We here demonstrate that both surface membrane-bound and secreted HD lectin activities participate in the activation of agglutinated lymphocytes. Among known adhesion molecules expressed by the HD cells, only the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) contributed to this activation as an alternative PBL binding site. As yet we have not identified the cellular ligand(s) for the HD lectin on the lymphocyte surface. Pretreatment of lymphocytes with mAb to the accessory molecules CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11b, or CD11c did not interfere with their response to HD cells. mAb to CD11a (LFA-1), the alleged ligand of ICAM-1, inhibited the ICAM-1 but not the HD lectin-mediated lymphocyte stimulation. Although lymphocyte binding could proceed via either pathway, lymphocyte activation always depended upon factors secreted by the HD cells, one of which we identified as a soluble form of the HD lectin based on its shared properties with the membrane-bound form including immunologic cross-recognition and carbohydrate-binding specificity. Although HD cell-conditioned medium alone stimulated lymphocytes, HD cell plasma membranes could compensate for low concentrations of this medium. In addition, resting lymphocytes, normally unresponsive, were triggered into DNA synthesis by growth medium when cocultured with HD cell membranes. The unique functions of the surface-expressed HD lectin and its soluble counterpart as lymphocyte adhesion molecule and mitogen might be physiologically relevant to the severe immunodeficiencies occurring in patients with HD.\r"

  ".U": "90038515\r", 
  ".W": "HIV-1 is capable of infecting many different cell types that express the CD4 molecule. In vivo and in vitro this infection is associated with profound immunologic defects. We have examined the effect of HIV-1 infection on the expression of MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules to explore the possibility that this important immune system molecule is perturbed after HIV-1 infection. Our data show that in vitro, HIV-1 infection of CD4+ PBL, and the CD4+ cell lines, CEM-E5, HT, and U937, results in decreased expression of MHC-I molecules on the cell surface. This down-modulation is transient, occurring 18 h after HIV-1 infection of CD4+ PBL and returning to normal expression by 24 h. In CEM-E5, MHC-I down-modulation occurs over the course of days, reaching its greatest decrease (40%) about the time the cells are producing the most virus. Reversal of MHC-I expression to normal levels occurs as viral production decreases. Down-regulation during the time periods examined appear to be specific for MHC-I and does not occur with other cell-surface Ag nor is it caused by selection of a preexisting cell population with low MHC-I expression. Radioimmunoprecipitation of MHC-I protein from CEM-E5 indicated that the decrease of surface MHC-I is caused by decreased total protein secondary to a decrease in the level of mRNA for MHC-I. These decreased levels of MHC-I are biologically relevant because HIV-1 infected CEM-E5 cells are less susceptible to CTL lysis determined by the use of MHC-I cytolytic T cell clones and with the use of cold target-inhibition assay.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic mRNA levels of the mouse major acute phase proteins serum amyloid P component (SAP) and serum amyloid A component (SAA) were monitored at timed intervals after i.p. injection of thioglycollate or s.c. injection of azocasein. Both mRNA increased dramatically in response to either inflammatory stimulus. The increase in SAA mRNA levels accompanied an abrupt change in mRNA size from 650 to 750 bases. Peak SAA mRNA concentrations were observed 18 h after either stimulus; by 72 h concentrations had returned to preinflammatory levels. Peak SAP mRNA concentrations were observed 8 h after thioglycollate and 12 to 18 h after azocasein injection; by 36 h concentrations were close to preinflammatory levels. All mRNA species studied (SAP, SAA and the complement components C3, C5 and factor B) were induced more rapidly by the thioglycollate stimulus and reached higher peak concentrations. SAP mRNA levels were correlated with other parameters of inflammation: infiltration of peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) into the peritoneum after thioglycollate injection, and serum concentrations of SAP after azocasein injection. Serum SAP concentrations rose 20-fold in response to the latter stimulus by 36 h, i.e., 18 to 24 h after the peak SAP mRNA levels. The highest numbers of PEC were present 24 h after the thioglycollate stimulus, i.e. 16 h after the maximum SAP mRNA concentration, indicating the continuation of an active local inflammation many hours after one aspect of the systemic response has ceased.\r"

Based upon nucleotide sequence analysis, both clones are predicted to encode small, structurally related polypeptides, each containing a hydrophobic leader sequence characteristic of secreted proteins and a motif of four conserved cysteine residues. Further, I-309 and G-26 are structurally related to a growing family of genes that apparently encode small polypeptides whose secretion is induced upon cell activation. I-309 represents a previously undescribed human gene. We have generated an anti-peptide antiserum to the I-309 gene product which recognizes proteins in culture supernatants of an activated T cell clone and of COS cells transfected with the I-309 cDNA, supporting the idea that I-309 encodes a secreted protein. Because I-309 encodes a small protein secreted by activated T cells that displays structural features similar to other cytokines, we believe that it defines a novel cytokine with as yet unknown function.\r"

Two human anti-La mAb were developed; one an IgM (kappa) (designated 8G3) and the second an IgG1 (kappa) (9A5) isotype. The mAb 8G3 immunoprecipitated the La RNA and La protein from crude human cell lysates; bound the 50-kDa La protein and a 28-kDa digestion fragment in immunoblots, and recognized a small defined internal segment from the cloned La protein. In contrast, the IgG isotype (9A5) failed to precipitate native La from cell lysates but bound the same segment of digested La protein and the same polypeptide of 131 amino acids in length from the cloned La protein. Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with these mAb demonstrated that the La protein is a component of a subset of Ro particles. The data suggest that the La protein is not present on the hY RNA in the absence of the Ro polypeptide. These observations may define functional subsets or maturation states of hY RNA based on their association with Ro or Ro and La polypeptides.\r"

  ".W": "The HLA-A2 molecule contains a putative peptide binding site that is bounded by two alpha-helices and a beta-pleated sheet floor. Previous studies have demonstrated that the influenza virus matrix peptide M1 55-73 can sensitize target cells for lysis by HLA-A2.1-restricted virus-immune CTL and can induce CTL that can lyse virus-infected target cells. To assess the specificity of peptide binding by the HLA-A2.1 molecule, we examined the ability of seven variant M1 peptides to be recognized by a panel of M1 55-73 peptide-specific HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL lines. The results demonstrate that five out of the seven variant M1 55-73 peptides could be recognized by A2.1-restricted M1 55-73 peptide-specific CTL lines. The two variant peptides that were not recognized by any CTL could bind to HLA-A2.1 as indicated by their ability to compete for presentation of the M1 55-73 peptide. In addition, 5 of a panel of 24 unrelated peptides tested could also compete for M1 55-73 presentation by HLA-A2.1. One peptide derived from the sequence of a rotavirus protein could sensitize HLA-A2.1+ targets for lysis by M1 55-73 peptide-specific CTL. We conclude from these studies that: 1) the HLA-A2.1 molecule can bind a broad spectrum of peptides; 2) T cells selected for the ability to recognize one peptide plus a class I molecule can actually recognize an unrelated peptide presented by that same class I molecule; and 3) a stretch of three adjacent hydrophobic amino acids may be an important common feature of peptides that can bind to HLA-A2.1.\r"

The protein would be reexpressed when one of the mutants was transformed with an expression vector carrying the OmpA gene. Finally, the identity of the reactive protein to OmpA protein was verified by homology in amino acid sequences. An NH2-terminal fragment of this protein was generated by tryptic digestion. Inasmuch as this was unreactive with the anti-HLA-B27 antibody, we concluded that the carboxyl-terminus contributed directly or indirectly to the reactive domain.\r"

Plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha increased 1300 and 200%, respectively, and leukocyte and platelet counts decreased by 36 and 38%, respectively.

We have previously shown that TNF alone or in combination with IL-2 can activate human and murine macrophages in vitro to kill MAC strains isolated from disseminated infections. To determine whether treatment with TNF and IL-2 could effect the course of disseminated MAC infections in a murine model of disseminated MAC infection, we infected C57BL mice with 3 x 10(8) bacteria i.v. and 1 wk later administered: 1) IL-2, 100 micrograms/kg; 2) TNF, 25 micrograms/kg; 3) IL-2, 50 micrograms/kg, and TNF, 12.5 micrograms/kg; and 4) saline. IL-2 was injected i.p. daily with TNF being administered in cycles of 3 out of 4 consecutive days. Fourteen days after starting therapy, blood was cultured and mice were sacrificed for quantitative cultures of liver and spleen homogenates. IL-2, TNF, and IL-2/TNF treated groups showed an 87 +/- 5%, 57 +/- 9%, 88 +/- 6% decrease in bacteremia (p = 0.05 for TNF-treated animals and less than 0.04 for the other two groups, compared with control). The combination IL-2/TNF was the only treatment that showed a trend toward an absolute decrease in the number of bacteria in the blood. Reduction in colony counts of liver and spleen were 77 +/- 4% and 87 +/- 6%, respectively, for treatment with IL-2, 58 +/- 7% and 87 +/- 5% for TNF, and 60 +/- 10% and 82 +/- 6% for IL-2/TNF, respectively. These results suggest that both cytokines may play a role in the control of Mycobacterium avium infection and that the combination of a half-dose of IL-2 and TNF, despite not showing any greater efficacy, can be less toxic than TNF or IL-2 alone and might be useful for the therapy of disseminated infection.\r"

The physical proximity on chromosome 4 of the gene which encodes sensitivity to LPS (Lps) and the structural gene cluster which encodes IFN-alpha (Ifa), suggests the possibility that the Lps gene, whose product is unknown, may actually be a part of the Ifa gene cluster. The C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mouse strains carry distinct alleles at both the LPs and the Ifa loci. In this study, we have analyzed these parental strains, as well as 12 recombinant inbred strains derived from these parental strains (e.g., BXH strains), for inheritance of these distinct alleles. The results show the segregation of these two loci: in 5 of 12 BXH RI strains, the IFN-alpha restriction fragment length polymorphism characteristic of one parental strain was discordant with the predicted LPS response phenotype. Therefore, we conclude that the Lps and the Ifa genes are physically distinct despite the apparent cause and effect relationship which is observed phenotypically.\r"

These a-IdAb were immobilized on activated Sepharose and used to isolate anti-viral Id from bovine, swine, and murine FMDV immune sera. Both the bovine and swine antibodies recovered from the a-IdAb/Sepharose columns reacted with virus, and to a lesser extent with corresponding mAb-resistant virus variants. The binding of affinity isolated bovine and swine antibodies to virus was specifically inhibited by the homologous a-IdAb, and in addition, both were capable of neutralizing FMDV in suckling mouse protection and plaque reduction neutralization assays. Therefore, by means of a-IdAb probes generated against FMDV murine Id, two neutralizing Id were identified in bovine and swine. These results suggest that FMDV-neutralizing epitopes recognized by murine systems play a role in the overall immunity of foot-and-mouth disease-susceptible animals.\r"

Analysis of strain distribution pattern of survival of A x B/B x A recombinant mice indicated that survival is regulated by a minimum of five genes. One of these genes appears to be linked to the H-2 complex and another is related to an as yet unmapped gene controlling resistance to Ectromelia virus. Associations of defined traits with resistance or susceptibility to Toxoplasma cyst formation were also analyzed. Cyst number is regulated by a locus on chromosome 17 within 0 to 4 centimorgans of the H-2 complex (p = 0.001). Mice with the H-2a haplotype are resistant and those with the H-2b haplotype are susceptible. This analysis also indicated that the Bcg locus on chromosome 1 may effect cyst number (map distance = 12 centimorgans, p = 0.05). Resistance to cyst formation is a dominant trait. To analyze relative roles of H-2 and Bcg loci on cyst numbers, C57BL10 (B10)-derived congenic strains of mice with known H-2 and Bcg type were studied. These studies indicated that the H-2 complex locus has the primary effect on cyst number.\r"

Mixtures containing these conjugates and nonionic block polymer (NBP) surfactants were used for immunization. After various immunizations of these conjugates without NBP the anti-S3 specific antibodies of IgM and IgG2a isotype decreased in both antibody level and avidity. The adjuvants NBP 1501 and L121 not only enhanced the hexasaccharide-protein induced IgM and IgG antibody levels but also clearly increased the avidity of the two antibody (sub)classes IgM and IgG2a. This effect was observed in normal (data not shown) and X-linked immunodefective mice. A maturation of the IgG antibody response was realized by the second immunization with hexasaccharide-protein conjugate whereas the third immunization showed no further increase in antibody level and avidity.\r"

  ".W": "The IL-2R alpha enhancer contains an 11 bp sequence that resembles kappa B, a regulatory element associated with several genes, including Ig kappa-L chain and human immunodeficiency virus. Although nuclear factor of the kappa-enhancer in B cells (NF-kappa B) binding is activated by PMA, TNF-alpha, and IL-1, activation of the IL-2R alpha enhancer does not consistently correlate with NF-kappa B induction. In this report, we show that TNF-alpha activates NF-kappa B and the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer in the Jurkat T leukemia but does not stimulate the IL-2R alpha enhancer. In contrast, this cytokine, and IL-1, increased IL-2R alpha gene expression in YT-1 cells. Comparing YT-1 and Jurkat T leukemias, we find that the IL-2R kappa B site is required for TNF-alpha and IL-1 stimulation in YT-1 cells, but that plasmids containing this site linked to a heterologous promoter do not respond to these cytokines. These data suggest that upstream regulatory elements in addition to IL-2R kappa B are needed to mediate this cytokine effect. TNF-alpha also synergized with PMA and other cytokines in the stimulation of the IL-2R alpha enhancer in YT-1. Because these effects are not observed in Jurkat cells, the function of the IL-2R kappa B site is cell-specific and likely mediated by different associated transcription factors present in each cell type.\r"

Cytolysis produced by cytolysin occurs in the presence of Ca2+ and is accompanied by the formation of membrane lesions of 160 A diameter. We have isolated a cDNA encoding rat cytolysin from the cDNA library of a rat large granular lymphocyte (LGL) cell line, by hybridization of the rat library with a cDNA probe for mouse perforin. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the isolated cDNA insert indicates that the mature cytolysin protein consist of 534 amino acids with a leader peptide of 20 amino acids. The protein contains two functionally important domains: the first domain is believed to contain the transmembrane channel and the second domain consists of an epidermal growth factor-type \"class B\" cysteine-rich region. A comparison with mouse perforin indicates that the two genes are very similar (89.9% nucleotide and 84.9% amino acid identity). Northern blot hybridization analysis indicates that cytolysin mRNA is expressed in rat lymphocytes (lymphokine-activated killer cells and LGL cells) and LGL cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "The Qa-11 Ag expressed in certain strains with the B2-microglobulin-b allele, apparently maps into the Tla region as well as into the Qa-2 region. Moreover Qa-11 has been shown to be biochemically indistinguishable from Qa-2. Genetic complementation studies combining the right Qa and Tla regions failed to lead to Qa-11 expression. To elucidate the molecular basis of this apparent paradox, we examined the expression of Qa-11 on products of transfected Q-region class I genes. Immunochemical analysis has shown that the Qa-11 Ag is expressed on class I molecules encoded by the Q7 gene from both C57BL/10 (Q7b) and BALB/c (Q7d), but not on the protein product of the Q9 gene isolated from the C57BL/10 strain (Q9b). Inasmuch as the predicted protein products of the Q7b and Q9b genes would differ at a single amino acid, a residue critical for Qa-11 expression has been identified. Based on these results it is proposed that among the beta-2-mb strains, the Qa-11+/Qa-2+ mice are likely to express at least the Q7 gene, whereas Qa-11-/Qa-2+ mice express only Q9. In support of this model, the Qa-2+/Q-11- recombinant B6.K2, essential for the apparent mapping of Qa-11 into the Tla region, expresses only Q9 but not Q7 encoded molecules on the cell surface, and only Q9 and no processed Q7 mRNA is detected in the cytoplasm. This expression pattern in B6.K2 cannot be explained on the basis of a single crossing-over event.\r"

Steady-state levels of mRNA coding for DR7 beta 1 and DR beta 4 proteins were evaluated with the use of locus-specific oligonucleotide probes and relative transcriptional activity at the DR7B1 and DRB4 gene loci was measured with nuclear run-on transcription assays. Steady-state levels of DR7B1 mRNA were found to be three- to nine-fold higher than those of DRB4 in DR7,Dw7 cell lines, but no mature steady-state DRB4 mRNA was detectable in a DR7,Dw11 cell line which shows no detectable DR beta 4 protein. Run-on transcription assays performed with nuclei isolated from DR7,Dw7 cells showed a five-fold excess of DRB1 over DRB4 transcriptional activity, but, surprisingly, no difference in activity at the two DRB loci in nuclei isolated from DR7,Dw11 cells. Both DRB mRNA were quite stable as indicated by actinomycin D time course experiments. Thus the differential expression of the DR7 beta 1 and DR beta 4 proteins in the DR7,Dw7 cell lines arises at the level of mRNA production; the lack of detectable DR beta 4 protein in the DR7,Dw11 cell line, however, appears to be due to a different mechanism in which transcribed DRB4 sequences fail to be processed into mature mRNA molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Two species, Fc epsilon RIIa and Fc epsilon RIIb, of the human low-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RII/CD23) have recently been described. They differ by only six amino acids in the cytoplasmic N-terminus and are generated by different cell-specific transcriptional start sites that lead to distinct 5'-leader sequences in the corresponding mRNA. In this study, we present the analysis of the promoter which is regulating the expression of the B cell-specific Fc epsilon RIIa. Our data show that this promoter is flanked by several long repetitive elements that are influencing transcription in the Burkitt lymphoma B cell line Jijoye. Serial deletions of the 5'-flanking region of the promoter revealed two major regulatory segments that have either inhibitory or enhancing effects on transcription. In addition, IL-4 caused a two- to four-fold up-regulation of the Fc epsilon RIIa promoter activity and the DNA element responsible was mapped within the first 250 bp of the 5'-flanking region. These results were confirmed by transferring the DNA segment containing the putative IL-4 responsive element to a heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. It was concluded that IL-4 augments the Fc epsilon RIIa expression by transcriptional regulation.\r"

Furthermore, many common cancers such as lung, colon, prostate, and pancreas are resistant to even transplant doses of conventional agents and hence require novel approaches such as biomodulation. This study shows that we can generate cytotoxic killer cells similar to lymphokine-activated killer cells capable of lysing NK-resistant tumor cells in vitro if we incubate human or murine bone marrow in IL-2. This was accomplished without affecting the ability of the bone marrow to fully reconstitute mice similar to that of fresh nonactivated bone marrow. Studies evaluating the IL-2 activated human bone marrow in vitro also indicated that these activated bone marrow have similar CFU to that of fresh human marrow. Furthermore, in murine in vivo studies, the activated bone marrow (ABM) caused significant tumor regression in tumor-bearing mice. Also, these ABM cells had similar or higher tumoricidal activity and longer kinetics than spleen lymphokine-activated killer cells in vitro. Also, the ABM had purging ability in vitro. Therefore this IL-2 ABM could be used as an active therapeutic tool and not just as a passive rescue element in the autologous bone marrow transplantation setting.\r"

Rather, expression of gp42 is selectively induced on NK cells by the high concentrations of rIL-2 that are required for the induction of LAK activity.

This latent infection is subject to periodic reactivations that serve as an important source of disease and death in patients with defective immunologic responses. The specific types of cells that harbor latent HCMV have not yet been identified. To detect latent HCMV and identify the host cells carrying it, tissue sections from nine HCMV-seropositive normal individuals were examined using a murine monoclonal antibody specific for one of the immediate early (IE) antigens of HCMV. Cells expressing the IE antigen were detected in several different tissues from six of the subjects. Tissues found to contain positively stained cells included brain, kidney, spleen, lung, and liver. No positively stained cells were found in any tissue from seven HCMV-seronegative individuals studied by the same procedures. Cells undergoing productive infection with HCMV could not be detected in any of the tissues containing IE antigen-positive cells. It is proposed that these IE antigen-expressing cells represent at least some of the sites of HCMV latency in normal seropositive individuals.\r"

CMV hepatitis was not a cause of fulminant or irreversible liver dysfunction in any of the 13 cases. Ganciclovir was administered to 6 of the 13 patients and was associated with clinical and virologic cure in 5. CMV hepatitis was self-limited in patients not treated with ganciclovir (illness less severe). The presence of inclusions within the liver tissue correlated with active disease.\r"

Concentrations of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) after the third injection were dependent on the interval between the second and the third dose; geometric mean titers (GMTs) in the three groups were 53 IU/l, 5,846 IU/l, and 19,912 IU/l, respectively, when the third dose was given at month 2, 6, or 12. Whereas the anti-HBs responses to the third dose at month 6 or 12 were typical booster reactions, the kinetics after a third dose given at month 2 resembled those after only two doses but on a significantly higher level. A fourth dose given at month 12 to the individuals vaccinated at months 0, 1, and 2 led to a prompt anti-HBs response similar in height to the response in those vaccinated at months 0, 1, and 12. Thus, for achieving a high anti-HBs concentration guaranteeing its long-lasting persistence, vaccination at months 0, 1, and 12 seems to be preferable to vaccination at months 0, 1, and 6. For individuals at high risk of hepatitis B infection, vaccination at months 0, 1, 2, and 12 might be considered for obtaining an optimal early seroconversion as well as long-term protection.\r"

Blocking either the Fc segment of the monoclonal antibody of the Fc receptor on the cells diminished the enhancement, suggesting that this phenomenon involves attachment of the monoclonal antibody to the virus followed by attachment of the Fc of this complex to the Fc receptor on the cells. These data indicate that antibody-mediated enhancement of RSV infection can occur in vitro in macrophages.

Of 40 seropositive men, 38 (95%) were PCR-positive; one was PCR-indeterminate and one PCR-negative. None of 41 seronegative men who used only donor-screened, virus-inactivated coagulation factor products were PCR-positive.

PCR with a second primer pair also detected HIV-1 DNA in these two men. None of 25 seronegative female sex partners of seropositive men, including six men with AIDS and seven with AIDS-related symptoms, were PCR-positive. These data suggest that most seropositive hemophilic men are HIV-infected; whether some are infected with defective virus remains to be resolved as does the infection status of seropositive PCR-negative men. Identification of two seronegative PCR-positive men supports the possibility that HIV-1 DNA can be detected before seroconversion.\r"

Of 75 patients enrolled in the study, 8 (10.7%) had a fourfold rise or fall in titer to Ehrlichia canis (case-patients). The rate was 5.3 cases/100,000 population. Case-patients were more likely than noncase patients to have become ill in May or June (P = .008) and to report a recent tick bite (P less than .001). At hospital admission, case-patients had lower white blood cell counts (median, 4,450/mm3; P = .001), platelet counts (median, 133,000/mm3 P less than .001), and higher aspartate aminotransferase (median, 68 IU/ml; P = .004) and alanine aminotransferase levels (median, 62 IU/ml; P = .038).\r"

  ".W": "Antimicrobial resistance determinants and plasmids present in 10 multiply antibiotic-resistant strains of Hemophilus influenzae isolated from patients in different geographic regions of Spain were characterized. Conjugative plasmids with molecular sizes of 38-50 MDa encoded resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. Trimethoprim resistance was not linked to the other antibiotic resistance determinants and trimethoprim-resistant transconjugants and transformants lacked detectable plasmid DNA, suggesting that this determinant is chromosomal. Restriction endonuclease analysis revealed similarities among the plasmids, but several restriction patterns could be distinguished. Three hybridization patterns were found with DNA probes coding for H. parainfluenzae beta-lactamase and chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase. Resistance to kanamycin was due to drug modification by aminoglycoside-phosphotransferase (3')I. In Spain, it appears that multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes in H. influenzae did not arise from acquisition of a single R plasmid; rather, both plasmid and chromosomal resistance evolved independently from several sources.\r"

Meningitis was induced by intracisternal inoculation of 2 x 10(4) to 2 x 10(5) colony-forming units of Hib. Administration of ceftriaxone 6 h after infection provoked rapid bacterial lysis associated with greatly increased concentrations of bacteria-free endotoxin (lipooligosaccharide) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF TNF activity peaked 2 h after initiation of antibiotic therapy (24.4 +/- 2 ng/ml), was significantly higher than that in untreated controls (1.4 +/- 1.1 ng/ml; P less than .05), and was associated with a substantially increased inflammatory response as reflected by higher CSF white blood cell count (24,500 +/- 8,151 vs. 1,920 +/- 644 in untreated controls; P less than .05), lower glucose, and higher protein and lactate concentrations. Simultaneous administration of dexamethasone with antibiotic therapy resulted in a significant reduction in CSF TNF activity that was associated with a substantial reduction in CSF white blood cell count. These data suggest that initiation of ceftriaxone therapy in experimental Hib meningitis exacerbates the meningeal inflammatory response, which can be modulated by concurrent dexamethasone administration.\r"

Additional unvaccinated matched seropositives served as controls. Antibody responses were significantly lower among subjects seropositive for HIV (P less than .05). Fourteen (88%) of 16 seropositive subjects with baseline type-specific antibodies to one or more pneumococcal antigens less than 300 ng of antibody nitrogen/ml (ngAbN/ml) demonstrated a rise in one or more of these antibodies to greater than 400 ngAbN/ml. No clinical deterioration or decrease in T4 cells attributable to vaccination was found. Although antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccine among HIV-infected subjects were impaired, most with antibody levels less than 300 ngAbN/ml developed titers of one or more type-specific antibodies to levels greater than 400 ngAbN/ml without notable adverse effects.\r"

Increases in antibody were significantly greater among recipients of acellular vaccine than among recipients of conventional vaccine for antibodies to LPF in all age groups and for antibodies to FHA in infants and children aged 4-6 y; the increase in FHA antibody was also greater with acellular vaccine among children aged 18-24 mo but not significantly so. Compared with conventional vaccine, acellular vaccine was significantly associated with reduced frequency of leg pain and fretfulness at all ages and less frequent fever and anorexia at some ages. The reduced reaction rates and comparable or enhanced immunogenicity of the acellular vaccine make it an attractive candidate for larger field trials, particularly among infants.\r"

IgG responses to FHA and PT were similar in patients with pertussis and in infants immunized three times with whole-cell pertussis vaccine. IgA responses to FHA and PT were greater in patients with pertussis than in vaccines, and a serum log10 titer of IgA to PT greater than 1.9 was a useful discriminant of Bordetella pertussis infection. When compared with patients with pertussis, vaccinees had a greater IgG response to Agg 2/3 and an equivalent IgA response to Agg 2/3. Serologic responses to FHA, PT, and Agg 2/3 were common in family contacts but were smaller than the responses in patients with pertussis. Initial titers of IgG to FHA and IgA to FHA were significantly higher (P less than .005 and P less than .05, respectively) in family contacts aged 3-10 y than in patients with pertussis in an identical age group.\r"

To study the role in staphylococcal adherence played by fibrinogen or fibrin and fibronectin deposited on inserted catheters, 187 peripheral or central cannulae were prospectively removed from hospitalized patients. Compared with uninserted catheters, which allowed only minimal adherence, previously inserted catheters promoted significant adherence of staphylococcal isolates from patients with intravenous device infection. Adhesion-promoting properties were studied with laboratory strains having well-defined affinities for either fibronectin or fibrinogen: adherence of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I, which has the highest affinity for both adhesins, was more strongly promoted (10- to 50-fold) on inserted cannulae than was that of S. aureus Wood 46 (4- to 10-fold) or Staphylococcus epidermidis Rp 12 (2.2-fold), which has no affinity for fibrinogen but does for fibronectin. Although all types of cannulae contained significant amounts of fibrin, which may promote adherence of coagulase-positive staphylococci, results obtained with coagulase-negative isolates suggested that in vivo-deposited fibronectin is also a critical determinant in this process.\r"

The extent of erythema was evaluated by burn chart and pruritus was assessed by each subject using a rank scale; symptoms were thus classified a priori as mild, moderate, or severe and their summation determined a global severity score for red-man syndrome. There was no significant intrasubject variation between area under the concentration-time curves for histamine and vancomycin (P greater than .05). Pretreatment with hydroxyzine alone provided significant protection against vancomycin-induced erythema and pruritus (P less than .05) whereas the effect of ranitidine did not differ significantly from placebo. The combination of hydroxyzine and ranitidine offered no advantage over hydroxyzine alone. Similar results were observed for global severity scores. Thus in normal volunteers prior administration of a histamine antagonist (hydroxyzine) provided significant protection against vancomycin-induced red-man syndrome compared to that afforded by placebo. There was no significant benefit from the histamine antagonist alone or by its addition to a histamine antagonist.\r"

Mean interleukin-1 beta concentrations in ventricular cerebrospinal fluid correlated significantly with adverse outcome and with mean concentrations of endotoxin, white blood cells, and protein and inversely with glucose concentrations. Mean and peak endotoxin and interleukin-1 beta concentrations were significantly higher in infants who received intraventricular gentamicin and intravenous antibiotics than in infants given intravenous antibiotics alone.

  ".W": "We noted a frequent increase in the serum enzymes amylase, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease who are receiving zinc acetate therapy (25 or 50 mg elemental zinc three times daily). Typically, values are normal before the initiation of zinc therapy, increase to slightly above normal after a few weeks of therapy, and stabilize at the high normal range after approximately a year of treatment. Very large dosages of zinc (800 mg/day) produce even further elevation of serum lipase and amylase without the symptoms of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pathologic studies of a zinc-treated rat model receiving dosages equivalent to up to 25 times the effective dosage in a human being, which is based on milligrams of zinc per kilogram of body weight, reveal that no lesions are induced by zinc treatment in the pancreas. We interpret these findings to indicate that extended maintenance therapy with zinc does not pose a risk of pancreatic damage in patients with Wilson's disease.\r"

Ornithine decarboxylase activity (reflecting initiation of regeneration) was similarly depressed by 65% after 70% hepatectomy, by 58% after acetaminophen, and by 87% after galactosamine. It was not depressed after 90% hepatectomy. Intermittent marked but transient increments in blood ammonia level resulted in similar but slightly smaller enzyme reductions after the injuries with the toxins, and a reduction of 92% in TK activity after 70% hepatectomy. Thus, after toxic injury, both regenerative enzymes were substantially depressed by excess ammonia, whether present transiently in large amounts or persistently in small amounts. After partial hepatectomy, TK activity was similarly depressed by the large transient amounts of ammonia but was less affected by the persistent smaller amounts.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of increased sensitivity for endotoxin in pregnancy as reflected by the formation of microthrombi in renal glomeruli is unknown. It has been shown that reduced glomerular diphosphatase (ADPase) activity in the rat kidney greatly increases the intraglomerular thrombotic tendency. We now studied experimental intraglomerular thrombosis ex vivo in association with glomerular ADPase activity in pregnant and nonpregnant control rats after infusion of either endotoxin or saline solution. Each animal (Wistar rat) was equipped with a permanent vena jugularis catheter and received either endotoxin (1.0 micrograms/kg body weight) (n = 6) or saline solution (n = 5) 7 days before being killed; nonpregnant rats were also treated with endotoxin (n = 5) or saline solution (n = 4). On day 21, before the animals were to be killed, they were anesthetized and their left kidneys were perfused with adenosine diphosphate solution (10 micrograms/ml) and platelet-rich plasma (1 x 10(9) cells/ml). Perfused kidneys were processed for light microscopy, electron microscopy, enzyme cytochemistry at the ultrastructural level, and immunohistology. The results showed decreased ADPase activity exclusively in the glomerular basement membrane of kidneys of pregnant rats treated with endotoxin in contrast to the findings in control rats. In addition, exclusively in the group of endotoxin-treated pregnant rats, significantly increased intraglomerular platelet aggregation could be detected after alternate perfusion ex vivo. We suggest that, in the present model, enhanced susceptibility of glomerular ADPase for endotoxin is due to pregnancy-associated factors that have yet to be identified. This increased susceptibility may promote in situ formation of intraglomerular microthrombi.\r"

Protein feeding alters arachidonic acid metabolism in other models of renal disease, and there is evidence that the arachidonic acid metabolite thromboxane plays a pathophysiologic role in protein-induced renal injury. In this study we evaluated the effect of high-protein feeding on renal thromboxane production, renal hemodynamics, and renal morphologic condition in rats with experimentally induced diabetes. We induced diabetes in male Sprague-Dawley rats by streptozocin administration. Rats then received high (60% casein)- or low (8% casein)-protein diets. Eight to 11 weeks later, clearance of inulin and PAH and renal blood flow were measured. Rats fed 60% casein had higher glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow than rats fed low-protein diets. Rats fed high-protein diets had more glomerular hypercellularity, tubular hypertrophy, and arteriolar thickening than their protein-restricted counterparts. Renal production of 6-keto-PGF1a and PGE2 was not different between dietary groups. Renal thromboxane production, however, was greater in rats fed 60% protein than in rats fed 8% protein. We conclude that protein feeding stimulates renal thromboxane production and exacerbates morphologic injury in the diabetic rat. Short-term administration of the thromboxane synthetase-inhibitor UK 38,485 did not further increase glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow in animals fed high protein. Thus thromboxane did not appear to play a role in protein-induced injury in this model by a vasoconstrictive mechanism. Other possible mechanisms by which thromboxane may contribute to the renal damage observed are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To further validate the usefulness of quantitative measurements of urinary mevalonic acid excretion as an indicator of rates of cholesterol biosynthesis, we have determined the 24-hour urinary excretion of mevalonic acid in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia treated with drugs that have opposing effects on cholesterol biosynthesis. In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia treated with the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine (16 gms/day), urinary mevalonate excretion increased by 28%, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decreased by 21%. In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia treated with the 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor lovastatin (80 mg/day), concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the urinary excretion of mevalonate both decreased (by 40% and 34%, respectively). When cholestyramine was used in combination with lovastatin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by an additional 14% as compared to monotherapy with lovastatin; urinary mevalonate excretion rose by (25%), but the magnitude of this increase was not statistically significant. We conclude that rates of excretion of urinary mevalonic acid (which may reflect rates of whole body cholesterol biosynthesis) in patients with FH decrease on therapy with lovastatin and increase in response to cholestyramine treatment. When used in combination, these drugs counteract each other's effects on cholesterol synthesis, but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decrease further. Measurement of urinary mevalonate excretion affords a practical means of assessing the comparable effects of different dietary or pharmaceutical manipulations on cholesterol biosynthesis in human beings.\r"

Several studies have reported pK' to be variable in critically ill patients. We prospectively compared the pK' of patients in an intensive care unit to their severity of illness. Blood specimens were analyzed for pH, Pco2, and tCO2, and the results were used to calculate pK'. The tCO2 was also calculated from this equation by means of the measured pH and Pco2 and from an assumed constant pK'. Severity of illness was evaluated with the acute physiology score and the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System. A total of 2004 specimens were analyzed; they had a mean pK' of 6.126. A strong correlation was shown between calculated and measured tCO2; however, there was essentially no correlation between disease severity and pK'. We conclude that bicarbonate and tCO2 can be accurately calculated in critically ill patients.\r"

We studied the effect of propranolol on postresuscitation electrolytes in a canine model of ventricular fibrillation and cardiac resuscitation by randomizing 40 anesthetized dogs to four groups: ventricular fibrillation--no drug (VF), ventricular fibrillation--propranolol pretreatment (VF-prop), control-no drug (NoVF), control--propranolol (NoVF-prop). We measured serum electrolytes at baseline and periodically for 3 hours. In VF dogs, serum potassium decreased from 3.9 +/- 0.4 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/L 60 minutes after resuscitation (p less than 0.001). The decrease in potassium was prevented (p less than 0.001) by propranolol. Serum calcium decreased from 10.6 +/- 0.8 to 10.2 +/- 0.8 mg/dl in VF dogs 15 minutes after resuscitation (p less than 0.05); this decrease was not blocked by propranolol (p = NS). Serum magnesium increased from 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 1.8 +/- 0.1 mEq/L in VF dogs 7 minutes after resuscitation (p less than 0.001); this rise was partially blocked by propranolol (p less than 0.01). Serum glucose increased from 105 +/- 6 to 183 +/- 27 mg/dl in VF dogs 7 minutes after resuscitation (p less than 0.001); this increase was diminished by propranolol (p less than 0.001). Thus propranolol prevents the decrease in serum potassium after ventricular fibrillation in this canine model, providing evidence that postresuscitation hypokalemia is caused by the beta-adrenergic effects of catecholamines secreted in response to cardiac arrest. Propranolol blocks the rise in magnesium and glucose but does not block the decrease in calcium after resuscitation.\r"

  ".W": "Asbestos exposure causes diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Since alveolar epithelial cell injury is hypothesized to precede the fibrotic response in asbestosis, we investigated whether asbestos, either alone or in conjunction with neutrophils (PMNs), injured cultured human pulmonary epithelial cells (HPECs). HPEC cytotoxicity was assessed with a standard 51chromium release assay after a 16-hour incubation with asbestos and PMNs. Negligible HPEC cytotoxicity was observed after incubation with either amosite asbestos (500 micrograms/ml) or PMNs alone in serum-free media. However, incubation with both asbestos and PMNs caused significant HPEC injury, which was asbestos dose-dependent; causing 25% +/- 4% detachment and 52% +/- 8% 51chromium release with 500 micrograms/ml asbestos. The cytotoxic effects of asbestos plus PMNs were nearly completely attenuated with serum (20%) or catalase (100 micrograms/ml) but were not prevented with scavengers of superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, or hypochlorous acid. A role for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in mediating HPEC injury was also suggested by the demonstration of asbestos-induced generation of H2O2 by PMNs. Furthermore, H2O2 alone (10(-4)mol/L) caused significant HPEC damage. Intimate contact between asbestos-activated PMNs and HPECs was a necessary requirement for PMN-mediated HPEC cytotoxicity. These data suggest that pulmonary epithelial cell injury is mediated in part by H2O2 release from asbestos-activated PMNs as well as intimate contact between the epithelial cell, PMNs, and asbestos.\r"

We have measured serum concentrations of prolactin. gonadotropins and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) as well as free and bound oestrogen and androgen levels in 14 women of fertile age with MS. These women all displayed regular cycles without having experienced fertility problems. As controls 14 normal women with regular periods and ideal body weight of 91% (range 80-101) were included. Serum from both groups was sampled during the early follicular phase. The MS-patients had significantly (P less than 0.05) higher concentrations of prolactin, LH, FSH, total and free testosterone (P less than 0.01) and a significantly lower serum concentration of oestrone sulphate (P less than 0.01). The abnormal hormone concentrations were not related to clinical status of the disease. We propose that the increased androgen levels are of ovarian origin as adrenal androgens were normal. The reason for the slight increase of prolactin and the marked increase of gonadotropins in women with MS is speculative. As oestradiol levels, however, were within normal range, we assume that a peripheral resistance to gonadotropins combined with an abnormal central regulation causes the increased pituitary secretion.\r"

The peak mitral flow-velocities during the early rapid filling phase (E) and during late (atrial) filling (A) were measured and the ratio of these peak flow-velocities (E:A ratio) was calculated. The E:A ratio was inversely related to age (r = -0.50), heart rate (r = -0.47) and septal thickness (r = -0.36) at rest. Exercise caused a significant (P less than 0.001) decrease in E:A ratio as a result of an increase in the peak A velocity. No significant change in the peak E velocity was observed during exercise. The exercise E:A ratio was related to heart rate (r = -0.53), but not to resting E:A ratio or age, since the decrease in E:A ratio tended to be less in the older subjects. Our study shows that isometric exercise augments the relative contribution of atrial contraction of left ventricular filling and this increase may 'mask' minor changes in resting transmitral flow pattern associated with, e.g. ageing. Secondly, in addition to age, heart rate must be taken into account when studying populations with different heart-rate levels or interventions associated with simultaneous heart rate changes.\r"

The material consisted of 40 patients with first-time Q-wave MI (26 pts with ant. MI and 14 with post. MI). Nineteen age-matched healthy subjects were used as controls. The displacement of the AV plane was determined at four sites corresponding to anterior (AV-A), septal (AV-S), posterior (AV-P) and lateral (AV-L) parts of the LV wall. In anterior and posterior MI all the sites showed significantly reduced AV-plane displacement compared to healthy subjects (P less than 0.001). Moreover, within the anterior MI group the AV-A and AV-S displacements were significantly reduced compared to the points AV-L and AV-P (P less than 0.001) and the AV-L displacement was reduced compared to AV-P (P less than 0.001). In posterior MI the displacement at AV-P was reduced compared to other points (P less than 0.001) and, to a certain extent, AV-S was reduced compared to the points AV-A and AV-L (P less than 0.001). The reduced magnitude of the AV plane displacement seems to be an expression of regionally reduced systolic function. The method described may provide a simple means of defining regional wall motion abnormalities of the LV following MI.\r"

In total 73 women (84%) were dyspnoeic, 47, 17, six and four patients reported dyspnoea corresponding to WHO grades 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

The average individual percentage decrease of the concentration of Lp(a) was calculated after the exclusion of four patients who had serum triglyceride levels above 10 mmol l-1. The decrease was 38% with a 95% confidence interval of 28-47%. The absolute decrease of Lp(a) was correlated with the pretreatment levels of Lp(a) (r = 0.91). Within the whole group of patients there was a linear relationship between the percentage decrease of Lp(a) and that of LDL cholesterol (r = 0.88).

The metabolic acidosis was due to ketoacids, which were detected in the patient's breath and urine. The ketones cleared rapidly when theophylline elimination was increased with activated charcoal, i.v. metoprolol reduced excessive b-adrenergic stimulation and a 10% dextrose infusion repleted hepatic glycogen. Theophylline is known to increase free fatty acid levels. It is postulated that prolonged fasting led to depletion of hepatic glycogen and that ketones were generated by metabolism of elevated serum fatty acids. In previous reviews of the metabolic abnormalities associated with theophylline toxicity ketosis has not been described.\r"

  ".U": "90039109\r", 
  ".W": "Early identification of elevated cholesterol in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) is of interest as secondary prevention can then be initiated when patients are highly motivated. However, since the lipid pattern changes during acute MI, screening for lipid disturbances is often not performed until 6 months later. We prospectively studied lipid and apolipoprotein levels during acute MI and 3 and 6 months later in 123 consecutive acute MI patients, mean age 64 +/- 10 (SD) years, who were admitted within 24 h from onset of symptoms, mean delay 5.5 h. Blood was taken at admission to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU), the first morning in the CCU, at hospital discharge and at 3 and 6 months follow-up. Patients were fasted overnight except at admission, and no specific dietary advice was given. Total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I concentrations did not differ significantly (1-3%) between CCU admission and the 3 and 6 months control. During the subsequent hospital period, lipid concentrations generally decreased and at discharge were 15-25% below those at 6 months follow-up (P less than 0.001). The highest correlations between immediate CCU determination and 6 months follow-up were obtained for cholesterol (r = +0.71) and apo B (r = +0.67). Thus, lipid levels obtained early at CCU admission in acute MI patients are representative of the patient's baseline levels which are in contrast to those registered later during hospital stay. This information could be used to identify patients for early intervention.\r"

After outset of EPO all patients became transfusion-independent. Four patients did not reach the target haemoglobin (Hb) level 100 g l-1 in 5 months. These patients had higher serum concentrations of aluminium (225 +/- 87 micrograms l-1, mean +/- SD) than the responding patients (55 +/- 56 micrograms l-1). Addition of desferrioxamine to treatment with EPO resulted in a rapid rise in Hb values in these patients. Thus, aluminium may inhibit EPO responsiveness. All patients were iron overloaded. Serum ferritin levels declined in all but one patient with secondary haemochromatosis. In exercise tests the aerobic capacity and oxygen uptake increased during EPO therapy. Peak oxygen consumption (Vo2 peak), oxygen pulse, oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (AT) and total work output (W max) increased 19%, 36%, 26% and 24%, respectively. Lean body mass (LBM) increased by 8%. Taken together, all clinical EPO effects measured appeared clinically favourable.\r"

The results of the Karnofsky Activity Scale, estimated by a nurse, were in accordance with the results of the SIP score. The KSP-test showed that both men and women had significantly lower scores in the aggression scale than a control group.

This effect of increasing stress was present even after controlling for demographic and standard obstetric risk factors. High life change scores at 20 weeks' gestation and 34 weeks' gestation were not individually associated with poor outcomes. Those with low social support did not have a statistically significant higher rate of complications, and social support did not buffer the adverse effects of increasing stress. This study shows that serious and clinically important complications of pregnancy are related to stressful life change independent of biomedical risk.\r"

(2) Most respondents experienced less pain during the procedure than they had anticipated. (3) The major expressed motivation for obtaining the examination was to seek reassurance that nothing was wrong.

Women were interviewed about their demographic data, past medical and sexual history, and their history of vaginal or pelvic infections. An extensive dietary history was taken to determine each woman's usual adult dietary intake. Results indicate associations between total caloric intake, carbohydrates, and fiber and a history of Candida vulvovaginitis. The results were not altered by controlling for age, body mass index, smoking, use of oral contraceptives, and sexual activity variables.

A public school for pre-kindergarten through second grade (ages 4 to 8 years) in Yonkers, New York, was studied; all of 422 students were included and finished the study. A sequential group of parent drivers were also evaluated, although they were not subject to active intervention. All students were involved in a month-long curricular intervention to raise their awareness of seatbelt use and car safety (\"May is Buckle-up Month\"). Independent professional observers measured seatbelt use in a nonblinded manner before the intervention, after the intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. Belt use among students increased from 46% to 66% (P less than .01), and stayed at 63% at follow-up, although boys showed an insignificant change. Parent use improved from 47% to 61% (P less than .01), and remained at 62% at follow-up. Intensive curricular exposure to the use of seatbelts can measurably improve the use of belts by young school children. Parental behavior also shows a marked improvement. Such interventions can be organized by community health practitioners, including those in full-time practice, with minimal funding.\r"

Overall, an estimated 31% of family practice and internal medicine residency graduates are performing exercise stress tests in their practice. Programs provided an average of 7.3 hours of didactic instruction and 32.7 stress tests per resident. A minority (43%) had an established minimum number of exercise stress tests recommended for competency. Programs with and without exercise stress test training did not differ significantly with respect to age, size of program, or size of community. There were some interstate differences in the extent of exercise stress test training provided by family practice residency programs. Internal medicine programs were more likely to require a minimum number of treadmill tests. Otherwise there were few differences between family practice and internal medicine program instruction in exercise stress test training. Family practice program directors were more likely to believe that their residents should be taught this procedure and to include family physicians in their panel of instructors. Specific guidelines should be created to assure adequate stress test training for interested residents.\r"

This study examines the affiliation of an academic medical center with a prepaid capitation-based medical plan in western Washington state and focuses on demographic characteristics, prior existing medical conditions, recent utilization, and factors affecting enrollee choice of health care plan, clinic, and physician. It was hypothesized that university clinic enrollees would differ from nonuniversity clinic enrollees with regard to many of these factors. A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 400 university clinic enrollees and 759 enrollees in nonuniversity, private practice settings. The response rate was 56.1%. Results showed that, when compared with nonuniversity clinic enrollees in the same plan, university clinic enrollees were significantly younger and had more formal education. University clinic enrollees reported less health care utilization and expressed fewer strong preferences than nonuniversity clinic enrollees in choosing a health care plan, clinic, and physician. Based on this survey, there was no evidence that the academic medical center attracted sicker HMO enrollees than did nonuniversity clinics.\r"

In addition, the effect of drying over a four-day period in whole blood collected with and without ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) was examined. The results of the study showed that, under the conditions studied, the integrity of DNA is not altered such that false RFLP patterns are obtained. The only effect observed was that the overall RFLP pattern becomes weaker, but individual RFLP fragments are neither created nor destroyed.\r"

The evidentiary specimens chosen for DNA were classified according to substrate (scrapings, plastic bags, synthetics, denim, and carpet) and according to a subjective evaluation of the condition of the stain (soiled, damp, or putrefied) and to its size (small or large). The results show that DNA of sufficient quality and high molecular weight (HMW) can be reliably isolated from bloodstains deposited on evidentiary items which have an unknown environmental history and which have dried onto a variety of substrata. Subsequent RFLP analysis of a selected number of these samples verified that the DNA was suitable for this type of analysis.\r"

Case parameters were blood unconjugated morphine, blood, brain, and liver total morphine, sex, age, frequency of use, time of death after injection, cause of death, and presence of other drugs. The programs used were Expert 4 (Biosoft-Cambridge), BEAGLE (Warm Boot, Ltd.), and KnowledgeMaker (Knowledge Garden Inc.). Interpretation was defined as estimating the dose, response, and time after drug dosing. The AI programs were used to advise on time and response outcomes for cases, to calculate the probability of the estimate being true, to develop rules for interpretation of morphine-involved cases, and to diagram a decision tree. On known cases the AI programs were successful 70 to 90% of the time in classifying the cases as to response and time. No data on dose were available in this database. The success rate in individual cases was proportional to the program-estimated probability. All three programs found the case parameters of most value in predicting response to be blood unconjugated morphine, blood total morphine, and liver total morphine. The case data most useful in estimating time of death since drug injection were blood unconjugated morphine, percent unconjugated morphine in blood, and brain total morphine. The rule induction programs found that morphine overdoses were characterized by blood unconjugated morphine greater than 0.24 micrograms/mL, liver morphine greater than 0.50 to 0.75 micrograms/g, brain morphine greater than 0.08 micrograms/g or greater than blood unconjugated morphine, and percent blood unconjugated morphine greater than 37%. Rapid deaths were characterized by percent unconjugated morphine greater than 44 to 50%; blood unconjugated morphine, as a function of other drugs present, greater than 0.09 to 0.21 micrograms/mL; and brain total morphine greater than 0.16 to 0.22 micrograms/g. This work demonstrates that inexpensive AI programs commercially available for personal computers can be useful in interpretation in forensic toxicology.\r"

Aliquots of whole blood from two separate Vacutainer tubes are diluted with 1-propanol as internal standard before analysis by headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC) with three different stationary phases: Carbopak B, Carbopak C, and 15% Carbowax 20 M. The actual HS-GC analysis, the integration of chromatographic peaks, the collection and processing of results, as well as the quality control tests involve the use of computer-aided techniques. The standard deviation of analysis(y) increased with concentration of ethanol in the blood specimen(x), and above 0.50 mg/g the regression equation was y = 0.0033 + 0.0153x. The prosecution blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) is the mean of three separate determinations made by different laboratory technicians working independently with different sets of equipment. A deduction is made from the mean analytical result to compensate for random and systematic errors inherent in the method. At BACs of 0.5 and 1.5 mg/g, which are the statutory limits in Sweden, the allowances currently made are 0.06 and 0.09 mg/g, respectively. Accordingly, the reduced prosecution BAC is less than the actual BAC with a statistical confidence of 99.9%.\r"

A simple \"radial-head method\" of sex determination consists of measuring the maximum and minimum diameters of the head and comparing such measurements with the test cutoff points. The subject is female when the maximum radial head diameter (either left or right) is less than or equal to 21 mm, and male when the maximum diameter (either left or right) is greater than or equal to 24 mm. The same decisions apply to the minimum diameters of 20 mm or less and 23 mm or more, respectively. When the maximum diameter is 23 mm or the minimum is 22 mm, the subject is more likely male; when the maximum diameter is 22 mm or the minimum is 21 mm, the subject is more likely female. The sample frequency of any one of these latter diameters is never more than 16%. Cross-validation of the method with a sample of 50 pairs of radii of the Terry Collection, different from the original specimens, resulted in 92% sexing accuracy when using the left radius singly, 94% accuracy when using the right radius singly, and 96% accuracy when using both radii jointly.\r"

Previous methods used to produce the postmortem photographs were problematic as orientation of the specimen could not be easily adjusted and positions were not reproducible. The objective of this paper is to describe the design and method of use of purpose-constructed equipment intended to alleviate these problems. The equipment comprises a skull-holding jig based conceptually on the Royal Berkshire Hospital halo frame. This is mounted on a pan-and-tilt device, incorporating calibrated measurement scales, enabling independent movements in each of the Cartesian coordinates. A camera is attached to an adjustable mount running on twin parallel rails allowing the camera-to-specimen distance to be varied. The equipment has proven to be straightforward in use and offers considerable advantages over previously described methods for producing postmortem photographs.\r"

Statistical analysis of 17 measurements based on 141 northeastern Chinese femora shows that all measurements have significant sex differences. Sex determination by the midpoint method of a single measurement can obtain an average accuracy of 76.8%. The results indicate that of all dimensions the maximum head diameter is the best discriminator of sex. It alone can determine the sex of a femur with 85.1% accuracy. The results also show that maximum head diameter, transverse head diameter, epicondylar breadth, upper breadth, and medial condylar length have higher sexual dimorphisms than the dimensions of length. According to the result to stepwise discriminant analysis and the need for sexing fragmentary remains, 22 discriminant functions composed of various combinations of variables were calculated which can determine the sex of the femur correctly 82.3 to 87.2%. The methods of sex determination provided by this paper can be used to sex poorly preserved femora.\r"

Especially in a forensic setting, psychiatrists must bear in mind that they have a legal duty to perform a competent examination before they render an opinion. It is well established that malpractice liability does not require the preexistence of a doctor-patient relationship based on an undertaking for the purpose of treatment. The author discusses a long line of cases in New York State which holds that psychiatric examiners are potentially liable in malpractice for any breach of duty with respect to those functions that are undertaken. Failure to conduct a proper, careful, and competent examination may result in liability in a variety of areas: competency examinations, commitment proceedings, workers' compensation claims, and so on. Limitations on such malpractice liability are discussed. Unlike some jurisdictions, New York does not accord judicial immunity to psychiatric examiners.\r"

Three groups of subjects were obtained: a normal sample of 120 parents of elementary school children, 36 psychiatric inpatients meeting Research Diagnostic Criteria for major depressive episode, and 54 hospitalized veterans meeting Diagnostic Interview Schedule criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The three groups differed significantly on all measures of anger experience, hostility, anger suppression, and anger expression. The depressed group reported greater levels of hostility and anger experience than the normal group but less than the PTSD group. On measures of anger suppression and expression, the depressed group exhibited more suppression than either the normal or the PTSD group and generally reported levels of anger expression comparable with the normal group's. The PTSD group reported the highest levels of anger expression. Within the depressed group, severity of depression was positively associated with levels of hostility and anger experience but was not related to measures of anger expression and was only partially related to anger suppression. These results are discussed as they relate to the \"anger turned in\" hypothesis of psychodynamic theories of depression, and directions for future research are noted.\r"

Data on deaths, physical illnesses, psychological disturbances, and socioenvironmental events experienced by patients before admission were gleaned from interviews and institutional records. Life events and GAS were scored independently. Only deaths and socioenvironmental events were significantly associated with psychopathology. Specifically, deaths of grandparents during infancy corresponded to lower functioning at admission. Additional analyses showed that severe reactions of patients' mothers to grandparent deaths had been more common among those adolescents who were most disturbed at the time they were admitted to the hospital. These findings were largely serendipitous, however, and need replication.\r"

The conditional probability of meeting the full diagnostic set given each individual and combination of two, three, and four criteria is calculated. The best two-way (characteristic symptoms + absence of affective syndrome) and three way (characteristic symptoms + absence of affective syndrome + 6-month duration) combinations of criteria were associated with 93% and 100% probability of meeting the complete definition. Other criteria were relatively nonspecific. The data suggest that the efficiency and descriptive validity of future definitions of schizophrenia might be improved by including those features unique to the diagnosis and eliminating those that are relatively uninformative.\r"

The characteristics of muscle biopsies were as follows. By light microscopy, internal nuclei were present in many of the fibres. By electron microscopy many fibres contained filamentous bodies and subsarcolemmal aggregates of mitochondria embedded in the peripheral zone of cytoplasm, and occasional mitochondria with disorganized or branched cristae were larger than normal. Biopsies of sural nerves revealed a decreased number of myelinated fibres, clusters of small myelinated fibres, and evidence of active axonal degeneration such as disintegrated myelin segments and degenerated axon components, as well as loss of axonal contents. With the present biopsy findings, it is suggested that the pathological process of this syndrome affects peripheral nerves as well as muscles.\r"

The number of nerve fibres per unit selected area of the white matter was significantly less in PSVE compared with that in the control group or in SDAT. Nerve fibres in PSVE had a tendency to have thinner myelin sheaths than in the control group or in SDAT, but the difference was not significant. The pallor of the frontal white matter in PSVE is mainly based on the loss of nerve fibres, and may be in part based on the thin myelin sheaths. The dementia in PSVE is probably related to the loss of nerve fibres in the cerebral white matter.\r"

However, in 6 patients, infrequent central apnoeas or hypopnoeas occurred which were associated with falls in HbSaO2 greater than those that have been reported to be in normal subjects. The magnitude of HbSaO2 falls appeared to be significantly correlated with functional residual capacity values. Overall, the findings revealed a relatively preserved, although unstable, blood O2 balance during nocturnal NREM and REM sleep in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, even in an advanced stage of their illness.\r"

In two patients with either acute meningitis or encephalitis and in one patient with a relapse of multiple sclerosis, oligoclonal IgG bands specific for enteroviruses were found predominantly in the CSF, revealing intrathecal synthesis of these antibodies. In three other patients with neurological symptoms probably unrelated to a current enterovirus infection, IEF and AMI disclosed nearly identical patterns of coxsackievirus-B-specific oligoclonal bands in the CSF and serum, indicating diffusion of these antibodies from the serum into the CSF. Although the number of patients in this study is small, the results suggest that intrathecally synthesized enterovirus-specific antibodies may be used as a means of identifying an enterovirus infection of the CNS.\r"

The patients acted as their own controls and performed finger taps under three task conditions: (1) where all taps had to be of the same force intensity: no stress; (2) where it was known that one of the taps had to be executed with an augmented force: stress simple reaction time (SRT); and (3) where it was not known prior to initiation which one of the taps was to be more forcefully produced: stress choice reaction time (CRT). Reaction time data revealed a between-condition effect where stress SRT was faster than stress CRT and no stress was faster than both. Under both speed conditions, the interval after the stressed tap was profoundly lengthened. It was found that the lengthening was due to increases in both lift and dwell times for the slow tapping rate. In contrast, at the fast tapping rate, proportionately more of the interval increase was due to the increase in lift time. These findings suggest that patients with Parkinson's disease, when performing under a motor program mode, have difficulty in initiating a sequence and making a transition to lighter force levels after a stressed tap.\r"

As the neurological functions became normal, the late components appeared. It is concluded that while absent late components of SEPs do reflect cortical dysfunction, they are not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis. Repetitive recordings of SEPs appear to be a useful tool for assessing the neurological condition and the prognosis of patients with cerebral fat embolism.\r"

In the former, muscle biopsy revealed vacuolar myopathy and virtual absence of amylo-1,6-glucosidase enzyme. Few familial cases of debrancher deficiency neuromuscular disorder have been reported.

Despite their rarity, pseudohypoparathyroidism and Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy are of major interest, since they represent the only human disease states in which G protein function has been found to be disrupted. The overall clinical picture was strongly suggestive of a genetic deficiency of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein, termed Gs. The putative involvement of another G protein, contained in rods and cones, transducin, in the pathogenesis of the retinopathy is discussed.\r"

Variation in protection from Pap screening was examined by age, race, age at first intercourse, barrier contraception use, and source of last Pap test (obstetrician-gynecologist vs other provider type). Results showed older women, women with earlier age of first intercourse, and non-users of barrier contraception received slightly less protection from Pap tests, while women who received their last Pap test from an obstetrician-gynecologist received significantly more protection than women who did not.

In fact, with a better understanding of meta-analysis in the context of the full scientific research process, meta-analysis is seen as a key element for improving individual research efforts and their reporting in the literature. This in turn will further enhance the role of meta-analysis in helping clinicians and policy makers answer clinical questions.\r"

Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) on experienced and tested muscle strength, endurance and balance/coordination, revealed a significant RA-OA difference (p less than 0.05). Separate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) indicated OA patients to show decreased tested endurance compared with the RA group. There was no significant RA-OA difference as to pain.

Any type of maternal employment, however, may be a risk factor for spontaneous abortion, and potential confounder in occupational reproductive studies. This study evaluates the effect of employment in a cohort of pregnancies of 1535 women. Employed pregnancies had a significantly higher rate of spontaneous abortion (14.5%) than unemployed pregnancies (11.7%) (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.49). Gravidity acted as an effect modifier, as the employment effect was seen only in multigravidous pregnancies (RR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.72) and not primigravidous pregnancies (RR = 0.96). The effect persisted when an independent sample of one randomly selected pregnancy per woman was used for the analysis (RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 0.90, 1.79). The data were examined for confounding by other factors which could explain the excess in spontaneous abortion among employed pregnancies. The employment effect persisted with adjustment for other risk factors including maternal age, education, income, maternal diabetes, race, alcohol usage and smoking, and prior pregnancy ending in induced abortion. Stratifying by prior pregnancy loss eliminated the employment effect among those with prior loss (RR = 1.03) but enhanced the effect among those multigravidous without the risk factor (RR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.15, 1.97). Selection bias, also, was explored as a possible explanation of this employment effect, but could not be substantiated. Assessment of a true exposure effect requires consideration of a potential employment effect either in the design or analysis.\r"

This approach avoids three problems that may account for the inconsistent results of prior studies: recall bias in retrospectively collected data, failure to control confounding in data analyses, and self-selection in the target populations. At baseline, the 2014 subjects in this study were 46.5-56.5 years old and still menstruating. Median age at last menstruation estimated from a model of the marginal distribution of age at menopause, was 50.7 years. When covariates were considered singly, age at menopause varied with smoking, education and income but not with marital status, parity, location, height, weight or use of either oral contraceptives or menopausal estrogens. Multivariate analyses showed that education and income were confounded with smoking status. The results indicate that many previously identified sources of variation in age at menopause reflect confounding with smoking and self-selection in target populations, rather than real effects.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term fluoride therapy for osteoporosis has been shown to increase the thickness of vertebral trabeculae as seen on spinal radiographs. To determine if this qualitative finding represents a measurable increase in spinal bone density, quantitative computed tomography was utilized to measure trabecular vertebral body density (TVBD) in the lumbar spine of 18 female osteoporotic patients, all of whom had been treated with sodium fluoride, 77 +/- 13 mg/day (mean +/- SD), and calcium, 1000 mg/day, for 57 +/- 24 months. TVBD in these fluoride treated osteoporotic patients (132 +/- 82 mg/cm3) was found to be significantly greater than mean TVBD for an age-matched group of untreated female osteoporotic patients (51 +/- 21 mg/cm3, n = 89, p less than 0.001). The value for TVBD in the long-term fluoride treated osteoporotics was not only similar to previously published values for TVBD (104 +/- 30 mg cm3) in normal females of similar age, but was also above the calculated TVBD \"fracture threshold\" of 100 mg/cm3 for females. Only one of the 18 fluoride treated osteoporotics continued to have spinal fractures during therapy, accounting for 4 fractures per 87.2 patient years of observation, a value which is significantly lower than the published incidence of 76 fractures per 91 patient years for untreated osteoporotic patients (p less than 0.001). Together, these findings demonstrate that long-term fluoride and calcium therapy for osteoporosis increases TVBD in the majority of patients within a reasonable time frame and significantly reduces the risk for spinal fractures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As controls 86 healthy men were selected. Of these 129 men, 112 were interviewed about their usual food intake in 1985 and in 1970. The retrospectively collected food intake data were compared with the data obtained in 1970. Retrospectively the average energy intake was overestimated by approximately 300 kcal/day. The amount of overestimation was statistically associated with change in energy intake, education and interviewer. The data collected in 1970 showed a significantly lower energy intake in cases compared with controls. However, the retrospectively assessed energy intake data showed no significant difference. A difference in energy intake between cases and controls may not be found when dietary intake data are assessed retrospectively.\r"

SpO2 was monitored simultaneously with two pulse oximeters, a Nellcor N-100 and an Ohmeda Biox III. The readings obtained from the two pulse oximeters were compared with arterial blood measurements obtained using a CO-oximeter. FINAP was monitored by a prototype device (Finapres) based on the Penaz volume-clamp method. FINAP was correlated with intraarterial pressure (IAP). Both pulse oximeters functioned well before cardiopulmonary bypass. The correlations with CO-oximeter values were 0.927 for the N-100 and 0.921 for the Biox III. Immediately after the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass, the N-100 pulse oximeter stopped displaying values. The Biox III pulse oximeter continued to display values during the cardiopulmonary bypass period; the correlation with CO-oximeter values was 0.813. After cardiopulmonary bypass, the N-100 began displaying values in 2 to 10 minutes. After cardiopulmonary bypass the correlation with CO-oximeter values was 0.792 for the N-100 and 0.828 for the Biox III pulse oximeter. The Finapres finger blood pressure device functioned well in 13 of 15 patients before cardiopulmonary bypass. The mean bias +/- precision of FINAP-IAP for mean pressure was 8.3 +/- 10.2 mm Hg (SD) and the correlation coefficient was 0.814. During cardiopulmonary bypass, the Finapres device functioned well in 10 of 15 patients. The mean bias precision of FINAP-IAP, for mean pressure in these 10 patients was 6.6 +/- 8.7 mm Hg and the correlation coefficient was 0.902.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the correction equations presented by Barker and Tremper and the technical literature of Ohmeda differ substantially from our equation when sufficient quantities of reduced hemoglobin are present and the fractional COHb saturation (SaCO) is high. Our approximated equation, derived from the Lambert-Beer law, is SaO2 = SpO2 (1 - 0.932 SaCO) + 0.032 SaCO. The equation of Barker and Tremper is SaO2 = SpO2 - 0.9 SaCO.

Advancing technology has made possible revolutionary changes in real-time monitoring and data recording. Concepts favoring the development and adoption of automated record systems for anesthesia are outlined through historic medicolegal perspectives on record keeping in general and computerization of the monitoring and recording methods in specific as a means of providing the best medicolegal evidence in defense of the anesthesiologist's performance. The analogy is often made between the successful development and acceptance of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder combination in aviation and ongoing software development for automated recordkeeping and the quest for its use and professional acceptance in both anesthesia and intensive care settings.\r"

Automation of the anesthesia record should free the anesthesiologist of the need to search for preoperative information and to manually record most information intraoperatively. Decisions about how much data to archive and how to extract the data pertinent to continuing care are the challenges for physicians. The technologic tools are available for the design and implementation of a software system that focuses on effective communication of the patient's problems throughout the perioperative period as the patient moves from ward to operating room, through the recovery room and intensive care unit, and to the ward and home.\r"

  ".W": "Although anesthesia records have been kept for over a hundred years, there is still discussion of their value and content. Two uses of the record are widely accepted: (1) review after the anesthetic event (as in medicolegal disputes), and (2) support of patient care during the delivery of an anesthetic. Although the anesthetic record is mandatory in much of the world, there is not a single standard for its format. Automating the generation and presentation of the record will enhance its value and help develop a consensus as to content. Merely automating the steps used to produce the manually generated record does not realize the full benefit of automation. For maximum benefit, the primary goal of automation should be to support the uses of the record. Specific techniques that are discussed include increasing time resolution, optimizing the type and location of input and display equipment, and tailoring the human interface. Particular attention is paid to the issue of how much detail is acceptable in the record, how to use visual cues to present detail properly, how to exclude extraneous detail, and how to avoid misleading presentations (erroneous interpretation of the data). Specific elements discussed include line width, the use of color, presentation of gradients, statistical summaries, contexts for reporting data, graphical techniques for increasing data content, and pictorial presentations. Current records are more often confusing because presented information is inconsistently displayed or irrelevant than because too much information is offered, and automation can ameliorate this problem.\r"

Similar features can be recognized only in a minority of non-SCLC tumors. During a period of 30 months, all diagnostic non-SCLC biopsies (141 cases) were prospectively analysed for the presence of markers indicative for neuroendocrine differentiation. In 31% of all cases, such a presence could be noticed. Neuroendocrine differentiation (50% to 100% positive-staining tumor cells) was recognized more frequently in adenocarcinoma when compared to large-cell and squamous-cell carcinoma (chi 2 = 9.31, 2 degrees of freedom, P less than 0.01). To investigate whether the clinical behavior of these \"neuroendocrine\" non-SCLC cases mimics SCLC, a multivariate analysis for prognostic factors was performed. Among other prognostic factors, biopsies containing more than 50% positive-staining tumor cells with the MOC antibody-1 (MOC-1) were recognized as negative prognostic factors.\r"

  ".W": "We commenced a study in September 1981 to investigate the role of high-dose combination chemotherapy in the management of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas who had failed conventional therapy. Fifty patients with diffuse intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were treated with high-dose combination chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMT) and have a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Twenty patients had disease that was still responsive to conventional-dose chemotherapy, 15 had achieved a partial response (PR) to first-line therapy, and five were showing PR to salvage therapy after relapse. Twelve of these patients (60%) achieved complete remission (CR) (two following boost radiotherapy) and three patients have nonprogressive masses on computed tomographic (CT) scan as the only abnormality. None of these patients died during the procedure. Twenty-nine patients had disease not responsive to chemotherapy at conventional dosages: 19 had no response to first-line therapy and 10 showed no response to salvage therapy given after relapse. Only three of these patients achieved CR, all of short duration only. Only two patients in this group remain alive more than 2 years after the procedure and both have nonprogressive abnormalities on CT scan. Nine patients (31%) died of sepsis during the procedure. In those patients with disease not responsive to conventional-dose therapy, dose escalation is associated with a high procedure-related mortality and a low response rate. In those patients who still have chemotherapy-responsive disease the response rate is high and mortality is low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was concluded that the structure of the classification be maintained. It was particularly recommended: (1) that computed tomography (CT) be included as a technique for evaluating intrathoracic and infradiaphragmatic lymph nodes; (2) that the criteria for clinical involvement of the spleen and liver be modified to include evidence of focal defects with two imaging techniques and that abnormalities of liver function be ignored; (3) that the suffix 'X' to designate bulky disease (greater than 10 cm maximum dimension) be introduced; and (4) that a new category of response to therapy, unconfirmed/uncertain complete remission (CR[u]), be introduced to accommodate the difficulty of persistent radiological abnormalities of uncertain significance.\r"

Eighteen (41%) patients with preleukemia evolving into AML achieved complete remission compared with 111 (73%) patients with de novo AML (P less than .01). Patients with preleukemia-AML had a significantly longer period to recovery of granulocytes. Multivariate analysis indicated that presence of a previous preleukemic syndrome and advancing age were independent poor prognostic indicators for achieving remission. For patients who achieved remission, disease-free survival and overall survival were also inferior for patients with previous preleukemia; disease-free survival was 17 +/- 17% at 3 years compared with 29 +/- 10% in patients with de novo AML (P = .02). These data indicate that intensive chemotherapy has limited efficacy in patients with AML following a preleukemic syndrome. Durable remissions may be achieved in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to reduce the severity of late neurotoxicities associated with cranial irradiation, 14 infants and young children with malignant brain tumors were given preirradiation chemotherapy for 2 to 22 months (median, 8 months). Prospective neurodevelopmental evaluations were routinely conducted and now extend from 35 to 60 months (median, 41 months) postdiagnosis, and 10 to 52 months (median, 31 months) postirradiation in the 12 surviving children. At the initiation of chemotherapy, less than one fourth of the patients displayed normal performance status or mental functioning on age-corrected tests; the majority remained stable or declined while receiving chemotherapy. Declining mental development and adaptive behavior were noted in six patients following radiation therapy with only two patients now functioning in the normal range for age. The analysis suggests that neurodevelopmental progress is a function of multiple factors, including neurologic and sensorimotor deficits associated with the tumor, surgical intervention, and chemotherapy that antedated radiation therapy. This implies that delaying irradiation will not necessarily improve the patients' functional status. Whether the interval of postponement of irradiation evidenced in this sample will translate into an ultimately better quality of life remains unknown. Given the probable interaction of multiple risk factors, well-controlled prospective clinical trials are needed to definitively analyze this issue.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred thirty-six patients with stage II or stage III breast cancer were treated on an adjuvant protocol containing fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (FACVP). Depending on the estrogen-receptor (ER) status, the patients were subdivided to receive maintenance chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen. The administered dose intensity of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) (mg/m2/wk) relative to the projected dose intensity (based on planned dose) was computed for each patient. The relative dose intensity of the first six cycles of chemotherapy (RDI6) was compared with disease-free survival (DFS). Of the 299 patients who completed at least six cycles of therapy, 83% received dose intensities within 20% of standard intensity (.8 less than or equal to RDI6 less than or equal to 1.2). The group with the highest dose intensity (RDI6 greater than or equal to 1.13) had the longest DFS, though there was not a clear trend of linear association between dose intensity and DFS after adjustment for prognostic factors (P = .16). The patients who received at least standard dose intensity (RDI6 greater than or equal to 1.0) had longer DFS than those whose therapy did not reach standard intensity (RDI6 less than 1.0). This difference was significant in patients with stage III disease (P = .01). The 37 patients who completed fewer than six cycles of chemotherapy had the shortest DFS (5-year DFS of 48% v 65% in the others). This retrospective analysis, in a heterogeneously treated group of patients, did not show the differences in outcome associated with dose intensity as demonstrated in the earlier studies comparing projected dose intensity of various cyclophosphamide, methotrexate-, and fluorouracil (CMF)-containing adjuvant trials. Improved DFS was noted in the stage III patients receiving higher dose intensity. Our failure to demonstrate the differences in stage II patients may be due to the narrow range of dose intensity in this study or to a difference in the dose-response curves depending on the stage of disease.\r"

  ".W": "A number of partial or complete remissions have been induced within the past 3 years in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with biomodulators, such as low-dose cyclophosphamide (CY) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), or active specific immunotherapy. Six of the most successfully treated patients, with prolonged remissions in skin, lymph nodes, liver and/or lung, all had relapses in the brain. At the time of relapse in the CNS, remissions were continuing in the other viscera. A large single intracerebral metastasis was found in four of the six patients; the other two patients had three metastases each, one of which also had meningeal seeding. Resection was performed in the four patients with single lesions, without postoperative radiotherapy. Intrathecal IL-2 successfully controlled meningeal disease. To date, the median survival of the group exceeds 7 months, in contrast to the usual reported median of 1 to 4 months, reflecting the predominance of resectable single lesions. Immunological therapy failed to prevent or treat metastases to the CNS, but may have influenced the patients' reactivity to the disease, producing single rather than diffuse metastases. If melanoma is to be cured now by any systemic therapy, particularly biomodulation, new regional strategies must be devised to overcome the blood-brain barrier. By analogy with autoimmune disease of the CNS such as multiple sclerosis, in which excessive cell-mediated immunity is found, several possible immunological maneuvers are suggested.\r"

The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 3 million U/m2/d of rhIL-2 with 5 to 10 million U/m2/d of rIFN-alpha-2a. The dose-limiting toxicities are moderate hypotension requiring low doses of pressors and chronic fatigue associated with decreased performance status. Other common side effects included fever, chills, fluid retention, nausea/vomiting, erythrodermia, weight loss, elevated liver transminase levels, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and CNS toxic effects. There were seven objective responses among 25 evaluable patients. Four major responses (one complete response and three partial responses) were observed among 10 patients with melanoma treated with the MTD level. These data suggest that for cancer patients, concomitant rhIL-2 and rIFN-alpha-2a therapy is tolerable and has manageable side effects. Further phase II studies will be needed to define the antitumor activity of this combination.\r"

In this study, the in vitro drug sensitivity of human tumors as well as clinical pharmacology and toxicology of DSU in patients with cancer were examined. DSU was administered orally, daily for 7 days with a 3-week treatment cycle. Dose-limiting toxicities were Met Hgb and RBC hemolysis. The maximum-tolerated dose was found to be 1,200 mg/m2/d for 7 days. In pharmacokinetic studies, DSU was found to have a prolonged serum half-life (approximately 30 hours) and a large area under the plasma disappearance curve (8,883.3 micrograms.hr/mL at 1,200 mg/m2/d). A partial remission was observed in one patient with refractory ovarian cancer. In conclusion, DSU can be safely administered to cancer patients and does display antitumor activity. Potential means of obviating the toxicities of this compound are discussed.\r"

In an attempt to design such a schedule, 49 courses of intra-Ommaya MTX (median dose, 6 mg) administered to 12 patients were studied. Using a fluorescence polarized immunoassay (TDx; Abbott, Dallas, TX), the median peak intraventricular CSF MTX concentration (CSF [MTX]) was 423 mumol/L. Median CSF [MTX] at 24 hours was 4.6 mumol/L, and at 48 hours was 1.05 mumol/L. Median MTX half-life (t1/2) was 5.7 hours. A CSF [MTX] greater than 1 mumol/L was maintained for 24 hours in all but one course and for 48 hours in half of the courses. No correlations were found between MTX dose, patient age, [MTX], t1/2 or prior therapy. Considerable intra- and interpatient variability was seen in MTX disposition, emphasizing the need to monitor [MTX] with each course. A schedule for intraventricular MTX with an initial dose of 6 mg and supplemental doses of 6, 4, or 2 mg at 24 and 48 hours according to serial measurements of intraventricular [MTX] should be initiated to provide a minimum CSF [MTX] of 1 mumol/L for 72 hours.\r"

Thirty-six vascular territories in 13 patients, ranging in age from 15 to 73 years, have been treated with a new silicone microballoon device. This balloon has allowed mechanical dilatation of segmental and diffuse areas of spastic intracerebral blood vessels less than 1 mm in diameter with return to normal luminal diameter. Follow-up angiography has documented improved cerebral perfusion without return of spasm. In 10 patients (77%), vasospasm was due to subarachnoid hemorrhage following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. In three patients (23%), spasm with resultant neurological decline occurred during detachable balloon embolization therapy for treatment of an aneurysm. In each case, the vessel caliber returned to normal size following balloon dilatation. In nine (69%) of the 13 cases, balloon dilatation resulted in improvement of neurological function within minutes to hours following the procedure. Transluminal angioplasty techniques may offer an alternative form of therapy in the management of symptomatic arterial vasospasm.\r"

Two patients died, one from an aneurysmal rebleed, and one secondary to diffuse vasospasm. There was one case of delayed stroke 6 weeks following the procedure.

This occurrence corresponded to crude incidence rates of 2.3/100,000 for all meningiomas and 0.17/100,000 for malignant meningiomas. Among malignant meningiomas, the male:female ratio was 1:1. The age-specific annual incidence rate increased with age up to the eighth decade where it peaked at 8.4/100,000. The distribution of histopathological subtypes was: 74 meningotheliomatous (38%), 64 transitional (33%), 14 malignant (7%), 14 fibroblastic (7%), seven psammomatous (4%), four angioblastic (2%), and 16 unknown (8%). The diagnosis of malignant meningioma was based on the World Health Organization criteria, with only Grade III and IV tumors included in this subtype. Clinical features did not allow for differentiation of benign from malignant neoplasms. Individuals with malignant tumors were, however, more likely to suffer paresis (50%) and less likely to be without deficit (14%) than their benign counterparts. The radiographic appearance of \"mushrooming\" was observed only in patients with malignant meningioma. All malignant tumors showed evidence of peritumoral edema; however, none exhibited calcification. During the 8-year study interval, the tumor recurred in 10 (71%) of the 14 patients with malignant meningioma. Tumor recurrence was accompanied by dedifferentiation from a more benign histology in four patients (2% of the total material).\r"

In some cases, it can suppress adenoma secretion and lead to tumor shrinkage. Pituitary macroadenomas are often associated with a vision-threatening chiasmal syndrome. In this series, SMS 201-995 was administered subcutaneously to eight patients with pituitary macroadenomas of various types responsible for severe long-lasting visual defects. An obvious improvement of both visual fields and acuity occurred in six patients, in two of these during the first 4 to 6 hours of treatment; in two patients, gonadotropic adenomas were unresponsive. Maximal improvement (normalization of visual fields in three cases) occurred within 6 to 45 days and was sustained during the 1- to 12-month follow-up period. This effect seems independent of the type of adenoma since the adenomas secreting growth hormone (GH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone and silent corticotropic-secreting adenomas responded as well as did two of the non-functioning adenomas. In one acromegalic patient visual improvement was obtained while the abnormal GH secretion remained unaltered. In all cases but one, no tumor shrinkage could be demonstrated. These data demonstrate that SMS 201-995 can rapidly improve the chiasmal syndrome due to pituitary macroadenoma, and suggest that this effect might be independent of a reduction in tumor volume.\r"

However, the outcome of surgery has been complicated by difficulties of access to the whole clivus, together with pharyngeal wound breakdown with subsequent development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula and meningitis. A technique described recently utilized Le Fort I osteotomy to improve exposure of the clivus in the approach to vertebrobasilar aneurysms, facilitating control of the aneurysm and reducing the risk of posttraumatic CSF fistula. The same approach, via maxillotomy, has permitted partial or total tumor resection in 13 consecutive procedures carried out at Atkinson Morley's Hospital on 10 patients presenting with tumors of the skull base. Neurological status was either improved or unchanged in all patients postoperatively, and pain relief was obtained in five of eight cases in which this was a presenting symptom. No patient developed a CSF fistula following surgery. Cosmetic results were good, and no problems related to malocclusion were reported. This approach may be used to advantage in the surgical treatment of skull-base tumors, at initial presentation, and can be repeated without undue difficulty should there be tumor recurrence.\r"

  ".U": "90039528\r", 
  ".W": "An isolated cerebral arteriole preparation was used to test the hypothesis that a temporary reduction in transmural pressure causes a subsequent vasodilation mediated by mechanisms intrinsic to the vessel wall. Thirty-five cerebral vessels of 44.7 +/- 1.4 microns (+/- standard error of the mean) mean diameter were cannulated in vitro and pressurized at a transmural pressure of 60 mm Hg: after an equilibration period the vessels developed spontaneous tone. When transmural pressure was decreased to 0 mm Hg for a period of 4 minutes then returned to 60 mm Hg, vessels dilated to 155.1% +/- 6.8% of control diameter before gradually redeveloping spontaneous tone in 5.5 +/- 0.7 minutes. Varying the duration of the period during which transmural pressure was at 0 mm Hg had no significant effect on the degree of vasodilation. Conversely, varying the level of decreased transmural pressure between 0 and 20 mm Hg significantly affected both the magnitude of vasodilation and the time course of spontaneous tone recovery. These findings indicate that a temporary period of decreased transmural pressure may result in a loss of spontaneous tone in the resistance vessels of the cerebral microcirculation. Mechanisms intrinsic to the vessel wall may play a significant role in the early stage of post-reperfusion hyperemia. Such mechanisms could also be implicated in other hyperemic phenomena affecting the cerebral circulation, such as the rapid increase in intracranial pressure after subarachnoid hemorrhage, the development of the normal perfusion pressure breakthrough phenomenon, and the initiation of intracranial pressure plateau waves.\r"

It has long been suspected that, due to its potent vasoactivity, erythrocyte lysate provides the major vasoconstrictive input to cerebral arteries during vasospasm. Under the model conditions (incubation at 37 degrees C in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid), however, the rate of spontaneous hemolysis was quite slow (about 1%/day), becoming only somewhat more rapid after 4 days' incubation. The rate of hemolysis of aging erythrocytes was dramatically increased (500- to 1000-fold) by the addition of plasma proteins, but only after the erythrocytes had aged 2 to 3 days, or more. The mechanism of age-dependent, plasma-induced hemolysis of originally autologous erythrocytes is shown to involve activation of the plasma complement protein pathway, analogous to the mechanisms of innate immunity which lead to lysis of nonautologous cell types and activate the inflammatory response.\r"

The presence of such markers in CSF after brain damage is transient and it is essential to understand their kinetics if they are to be used in clinical practice. In the present study, the CSF concentrations of two neurospecific proteins. S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), were determined in rats before and repeatedly after one of two types of experimental brain damage: traumatic cortical injury and focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. The two types of experimental brain damage resulted in significant differences in the kinetics of S-100 and NSE concentrations in CSF. Cortical contusion was followed by a rapid increase in both S-100 and NSE and a peak occurred in both after about 7 1/2 hours, at which time the values declined toward normal. A second, smaller peak was seen after about 1 1/2 days. The increase and decrease in S-100 and NSE levels in CSF was slower after MCA occlusion; a peak was seen after 2 to 4 days. Furthermore, S-100 was generally higher than NSE after trauma, whereas after MCA occlusion the NSE concentration was slightly higher than the S-100 value. These results support the use of CSF markers for estimation of the extent of brain damage in experimental models and forms a basis for the understanding of their kinetics, which is important for their use in clinical practice.\r"

In addition, IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression was checked on the cell surface of normal brain tissues before and after the intracerebral infusion. Reconstituted rIL-2 (specific activity 1.2 x 10(7) U/mg protein) was injected into the right cerebral hemisphere of normal adult C57BL/6 mice in three different dose groups, each receiving single or multiple infusions of 8, 32, or 80 U. In sham control experiments, mouse albumin purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography and adjusted to the same concentration of protein as rIL-2 was injected into mice at various doses. Anti-IL-2 antibodies were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay concurrently with assessment of IL-2 activity in serum. The IL-2R expression was determined by using immunofluorescence techniques with monoclonal antibodies against mouse IL-2R. Since histological alteration after rIL-2 injection did not differ from that in the sham control preparations, it seems that there is no direct toxic action of rIL-2 on normal brain tissues. Interleukin-2 antibodies were produced at low levels only in mice injected repeatedly at the maximum dose, and levels were insignificant in other groups. Serum levels of IL-2 activity remained low. The IL-2R expression within the brain was not enhanced within 8 weeks following the intracerebral administration of rIL-2, suggesting that direct intracerebral infusion of rIL-2 may be safely used in the immunotherapy of brain tumors.\r"

Serial measurements of the lumbar CSF levels revealed that the C3a and C4a levels were significantly elevated in the initial stage of SAH, but decreased rapidly. Within 48 hours after SAH, the mean C3a and C4a levels in the cisternal, lumbar, and ventricular CSF were significantly higher in patients with delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) than in those without DIND. The serially measured plasma levels of C3a and C4a in patients with DIND were elevated more than in those without DIND, but they did not show a significant change over time. Simultaneous levels of fibrinopeptide A (FPA), an indicator of thrombin activity in CSF, were also measured by radioimmunoassay. There was a significant correlation between CSF-activated complement components and CSF FPA. These results suggest that complement activation occurred in the subarachnoid space soon after SAH, chiefly due to activation of the coagulation system. The higher CSF levels of C3a and C4a in patients with DIND may indicate a relationship between these components and the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasms.\r"

Thoracic cordotomy did not alter the lumbar SCBF or the central conduction time as determined by spinal evoked potentials. Thoracic cordotomy significantly lowered the lumbar spinal cord injury threshold. Continuous sciatic nerve stimulation increased the lumbar SCBF in normal and traumatized animals; however, it did not affect the spinal cord injury threshold as measured by recovery of the spinal evoked potentials. It appears that rostral spinal cord integrity is far more significant in recovery from spinal cord injury than the maintenance of regional SCBF.\r"

  ".W": "A patient presenting with progressive paraparesis was found to have a dural sacral arteriovenous (AV) fistula. His condition deteriorated abruptly after thoracolumbar angiography. Embolization of the fistula improved the patient's status so that he was able to walk with crutches. One year later his neurological condition worsened. He was treated via an enlarged laminectomy because of uncertainty concerning a lipoma noted on the initial computerized tomography scan. The lesion consisted of an intradural filum terminale lipoma associated with an AV fistula, both of which were excised. The patient's condition was unchanged 6 months later. The different types of spinal lipomas and spinal AV malformations are reviewed, and mechanisms are proposed to explain the clinical deterioration in this patient. Venous hypertension seems to be the most likely possibility. The lipoma may have produced local hypervascularization of the dura mater with a subsequently acquired AV fistula.\r"

  ".W": "Electrocardiographically gated positron emission tomography (ECG-gated PET) with [13N] ammonia was used to assess regional myocardial wall motion of left ventricle (LV) based on a nongeometric method in nine healthy volunteers and 16 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Three transverse sections (upper, middle, and lower) with 16-mm intervals at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) were analyzed. The LV wall was divided into eight segments with every 30 degrees from septal wall to lateral wall. Based on circumferential profile analysis, the percent count increase [( ES count - ED count) divided ED count x 100) in each segment was analyzed as an index of regional wall motion. In the study of normal controls, the percent count increase was the lowest (32.9 +/- 7.2%) at septal wall of the lower slice and the highest (72.8 +/- 26.5%) at lateral wall of the upper slice (p less than 0.01). In five normal controls, the percent count increase was compared with the percent systolic wall thickening analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging, and a good correlation was observed (r = 0.84). In the study of patients with CAD, the percent count increase was compared with wall motion assessed by left ventriculography (LVG). The percent count increase significantly decreased as wall motion on LVG worsened. In addition, the value in normal controls tended to be higher than that in the segments with normal wall motion in patients with CAD. Thus, quantitative analysis of regional wall thickening was feasible by ECG-gated PET, which should be useful for combined analysis of regional function, perfusion and metabolism in patients with CAD.\r"

The method utilizes polar coordinate maps derived from circumferential profiles of true short axis slices; from the short axis data algorithms determine mean and minimum activity levels in the anterior, septal, lateral, inferior and apical regions of the myocardium, percent of the cardiac image in specific ranges of activity levels or their changes and the percent of myocardium beyond 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 standard deviations from the normal range with blackout display of the areas beyond these statistical limits for rest, stress, and stress/rest ratio polar maps. Additional applications include comparing stress-stress images to evaluate progression/regression of stenoses, early and late resting rubidium images for determining myocardial viability based on rubidium washout kinetics, and perfusion-metabolic comparisons for quantifying ischemia, viability and necrosis after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

To determine regional k in healthy human subjects and to estimate alterations in MVO2 accompanying myocardial ischemia, we administered [11C]acetate to five healthy human volunteers and to six patients with myocardial infarction. Extraction of [11C]acetate by the myocardium was avid and clearance from the blood-pool rapid yielding myocardial images of excellent quality. Regional k was homogeneous in myocardium of healthy volunteers (coefficient variation = 11%). In patients, k in regions remote from the area of infarction was not different from values in myocardium of healthy human volunteers (0.061 +/- 0.025 compared with 0.057 +/- 0.008 min-1). In contrast, MVO2 in the center of the infarct region was only 6% of that in remote regions (p less than 0.01). In four patients studied within 48 hr of infarction and again more than seven days after the acute event, regional k and MVO2 did not change. The approach developed should facilitate evaluation of the efficacy of interventions designed to enhance recovery of jeopardized myocardium and permit estimation of regional MVO2 and metabolic reserve underlying cardiac disease of diverse etiologies.\r"

Employing curve fitting, a history of [11C]Met activity was obtained as an input function. By means of sequential PET scannings and graphic analysis, uptake rate and distribution volume of [11C]Met in tumor tissue were calculated. In two studies irreversible uptake into the tumors was not seen when total plasma 11C activity was used as the input; however when [11C]Met plasma activity was used, definite irreversible uptake was seen, indicating tumor viability. In other studies, up to 24% underestimation of uptake rate was found. The present results demonstrated the importance of measuring [11C]Met in plasma for quantitative assessment of in vivo amino acid metabolism in tumors.\r"

The objective was to assess the preferential localization of [153Sm]EDTMP in bony lesions and compare it to the 99mTc-labeled phosphonates. Blood clearance of [153Sm]EDTMP was rapid with minimal accumulation in nonosseous tissues. Both radiopharmaceuticals showed identical lesion uptake in 23 paired lesions (p greater than 0.05). This indicates that the two radiopharmaceuticals concentrate in metastatic skeletal lesions by the same mechanism and since [153Sm]EDTMP emits beta radiation it may be therapeutically useful in ameliorating metastatic bony cancer pain.\r"

The existence of brain lesions has often been postulated but conventional investigations fail to demonstrate any cerebral abnormality. By means of [99mTc]hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HM-PAO) brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) we have studied 14 children suffering from congenital dysphasia. The brain computed tomographic scan was normal in all cases. In two patients with expression impairment the SPECT study demonstrated a hypoperfusion in the inferior frontal convolution of the left hemisphere, involving the Broca's area. In nine of 12 patients with global dysphasia (deficits in both comprehension and expression), SPECT study showed two hypoperfused areas: an abnormality in the left temporoparietal region and a hypoactivity in the upper and middle areas of the right frontal lobe. These results suggest that congenital dysphasia could be due, like acquired aphasia, to specific impairment of the language cerebral areas and that brain SPECT studies with [99mTc]HM-PAO could be useful for a better comprehension of the physiopathology of these disorders.\r"

To define the myocardial handling of [Cu]PTSM, the externally detected single pass extraction and retention of [67Cu]PTSM was characterized after bolus administration in 12 isolated rabbit hearts perfused with erythrocyte-enriched modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer which permitted physiologic flow rates. The myocardial residual (extraction) fraction at control flow rates (approximately 1.5 ml/g/min) was 45 +/- 7(s.d.)% (n = 12), and was invariate with ischemia (flow = 0.15 ml/g/min, n = 4), hyperemia (flow = 3 ml/g/min, n = 4) or with hypoxia induced by perfusion at control flow rates with hypoxic buffer (n = 4) (residual fraction 45 +/- 20, 43 +/- 8, and 49 +/- 8%, respectively, p = N.S.). Once extracted, the tracer was retained with a biologic t1/2 of greater than 3600 min in all groups. The high single-pass extraction, which is not influenced by flow, and the prolonged retention of this tracer under diverse conditions indicate that [Cu]PTSM could be a useful tracer for measuring blood flow with positron emission tomography.\r"

  ".W": "A theoretic examination of the validity at the cellular level of assumptions used in classic internal dosimetry has been undertaken. An alternate dosimetric model accounting for the consequences of selective uptake of a radiolabeled compound by specific cells in a multicellular cluster of hexagonal geometry has been developed. At the cellular level, derived dose estimates for electrons have been compared to dose estimates obtained employing the assumptions of conventional internal dosimetry. The study has been performed for all electron energies and then applied specifically to electrons emitted by 99mTc, 201Tl, 111In, and 123I. The dosimetric consequences of altering (a) the intracellular-to-extracellular radionuclide concentration, (b) the labeled cell density, and (c) the cell size have been examined for the labeled and nonlabeled cells in a cell cluster, and the conditions in which conventional dosimetry underestimates or overestimates the dose to individual cells have been indicated. It is shown that when selective intracellular uptake of a radiolabeled compound occurs in specific cells within a cell cluster, conventional dosimetry underestimates the radiation dose delivered to the labeled cells by twofold to more than 25-fold if the emitted electrons have ranges of a few micrometers or less, i.e., energies smaller than approximately 10 keV. Under the same conditions, conventional dosimetry overestimates slightly (20% to 50%) the electron radiation dose to the nonlabeled cells of the cell cluster. It is shown that inclusion of photons in the calculation of the total dose to individual cells does not alter significantly the conclusions of the present investigation.\r"

In a simple clearance experiment of a 1-I volume with a known clearance of 20 ml.min-1, the geometric mean data resulted in estimates of volume remaining in the container with a mean error or +2.0 ml (s.d. = 5.7 ml, range -4.5 +/- 15.3 ml), while the anterior and posterior images yielded volume estimates with mean errors of -10.1 ml (s.d. = 16.6 ml, range -47.4 +/- 10.5 ml) and +35.5 ml (s.d. = 22.6 ml, range -3.2 +/- 51.6, ml), respectively. The technique is easy to implement and does not require modification of existing hardware. An application of the technique to a clinical study of gastric emptying is also included.\r"

Recently, attempts have been made to evaluate other left ventricular functional parameters. These values include peak emptying rate (PER), time to peak emptying rate (TPER), peak filling rate (PFR), and time to peak filling rate (TPFR). In studying these parameters clinically, we identified many software errors and assumptions that impact on these values. These errors may also affect the determination of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). We conclude that before any serious investigation of left ventricular functional parameters is undertaken, a detailed evaluation and standardization of the acquisition and edge detection algorithms must be performed.\r"

  ".W": "A systematic error in dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) related to source strength has been previously described and attributed to an erroneous algorithm for deadtime correction. Since detected counts (or photon flux) is a product of source strength and attenuation, the effect of various source activities and attenuation depths on BMD calculations were evaluated using a phantom. Ten DPA scans were acquired at two source strengths, 0.3 and 1.0 Ci, and at each of two water depths, 16.4 and 24.5 cm. These activities and depths are within the range encountered clinically. Scans were acquired and processed using a commercially available lumbar spine scanner and software, and were reanalyzed with two upgraded versions of software. Mean BMD obtained with the initial software varied by 2 to 14% with changes in both sources strength and attenuating depth. Software revisions reduced but did not entirely eliminate these differences. The remaining 6% discrepancy is of sufficient magnitude to influence both patient management and research investigations.\r"

Twenty of the patients, all with abnormal initial TSC studies, had repeat studies 2 wk to 3 yr later; 15% showed no change, 35% showed some improvement, and 45% became normal. One of six patients with no TSC uptake required splenectomy 2 days after pancreatectomy for splenic infarction. These data suggest that the spleen usually survives splenic artery and vein resection. Absent splenic TSC uptake raises the possibility of splenic infarction.\r"

The most widely recognized feature is the perfusion to blood-pool \"mismatch\" characterized by decreased or normal arterial perfusion, with lesion activity which progressively increases over 1-2 hr. Although increased arterial vascularity of hemangiomas has been described, such cases either involved small portions of the lesion only or occurred in lesions not conclusively proven to be hemangiomas. We report a case of an angiography proven hemangioma with increased arterial vascularity involving a significant portion of the lesion as well as intense early blood-pool activity similar to that seen on delayed imaging. This case emphasizes the diverse appearance of hepatic hemangiomas using 99mTc blood cell scintigraphy.\r"

  ".W": "Technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer ([99mTc]ECD) is a neutral, lipophilic complex which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Brain retention and tissue metabolism of [99mTc]ECD is dependent upon the stereochemical configuration of the complex. While both L,L and D,D enantiomers are extracted by the brain, only the L,L but not the D,D form, is metabolized and retained in the monkey brain (4.7% injected dose initially, T 1/2 greater than 24 hr). Dynamic single photon emission computed tomography imaging studies in one monkey indicates 99mTc-L,L-ECD to be distributed in a pattern consistent with regional cerebral blood flow for up to 16 hr postinjection. Dual-labeled 99mTc-L,L-ECD and [14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography studies performed 1 hr after administration show cortical gray to white matter ratios of both isotopes to be equivalent (approximately 4-5:1). These data suggest that 99mTc-L,L-ECD will be useful for the scintigraphic assessment of cerebral perfusion in humans.\r"

Technetium-99m-L,L-ECD is a neutral, lipophilic complex, which is radiochemically pure and stable. Twelve healthy adults were injected with 25-30 mCi of 99mTc-L,L-ECD and imaged periodically for up to 24 hr. Planar imaging showed rapid brain uptake with a peak concentration of 4.9% injected dose and very slow brain washout (approximately 6% per hour during the first 6 hr). Repeat or dynamic tomographic imaging of the brain using either a rotating gamma camera or a multidetector system was performed up to 6 hr postinjection. The distribution of 99mTc-L,L-ECD in the brain did not change and was similar to the pattern seen with other perfusion agents. Background facial areas and lungs cleared rapidly. Peak blood activity was below 10% injected dose at all times and 99mTc-L,L-ECD cleared rapidly through the kidneys. Vital signs, blood and urine chemistries were normal in all volunteers and no adverse reactions were noted. These results suggest that 99mTc-L,L-ECD should be useful for routine assessment of cerebral perfusion in humans.\r"

Today's nurse executives must be able to articulate the value of nursing to other decision makers as choices are made about where limited health care resources should be distributed. Managerial decision makers are familiar with analyzing problems aided by quantitative data. This presents a challenge to nurse executives because the professional practices of nursing do not always lend themselves well to quantification. Caring is a central focus of nursing practice which is difficult to advance because of problems with its definition and measurement. Presented here is a model of caring which illustrates its complex nature, and which is supported by both quantitative and qualitative data.\r"
