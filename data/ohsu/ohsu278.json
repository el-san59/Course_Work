Onset time was rapid in both groups and the distribution of maximum ascent of sensory analgesia was T1-T6. Efficacy of analgesia was greater in the bupivacaine group, although the duration of both sensory and motor blockade was shorter than following cinchocaine. There were no significant differences between the two groups either in the incidence and severity of complications or in the condition of the neonates. The high incidence (50-65%) and often profound extent of hypotension seen throughout the trial, confirm the ineffectiveness of crystalloid preload of 1500 ml as a single prophylaxis against hypotension.\r"

In each experiment, hypotension was induced by equihypotensive doses of AD (0.03-2.0 mg.kg-1.min-1) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (1-10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). SNP induced a progressive reflex tachycardia and a reflex increase in rSNA to levels 159 +/- 35% above control at a MAP reduction of 55% of the normotensive control value. Equipotent doses of AD induced a decrease in HR and significantly less pronounced reflex increase in rSNA. The maximal increase in rSNA with AD was 55 +/- 19% at a MAP reduction of 30%. At higher infusions rates of AD, rSNA progressively declined toward the normotensive control values. However, AD elicited a progressive increase in preganglionic aSNA that was not significantly different from the increase seen during SNP infusion. It is concluded that AD-induced hypotension is associated with a suppression of postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity caused by an inhibition of ganglionic neurotransmission.\r"

In a retrospective study of 291 patients, 13 of 134 (9.7%) receiving epidural morphine developed recurrent oral herpes lesions in contrast to 1 of 157 (0.6%) not receiving the drug (P less than 0.001). In a prospective hospital-based study of 729 consecutive obstetric patients, 146 patients received epidural opioids (morphine, fentanyl, or both) and 583 did not. Recurrent HSVL lesions occurred in 13 of 140 (9.3%) patients given epidural morphine but in only 6 of 583 (1.0%) not given epidural opioids (P less than 0.001). Three of the 13 patients with HSVL received both epidural morphine and fentanyl and 10 received only epidural morphine. Because of the small numbers of patients receiving only fentanyl, no relation between HSVL reactivation and epidural fentanyl could be established. In patients having caesarean sections, the association of recurrent HSVL and the use of epidural morphine was significant (P = 0.04), suggesting cesarean delivery was not a confounder. A hitherto undescribed triggering agent, epidural morphine, appears to be associated with reactivation of HSVL in obstetric patients in the postpartum period.\r"

The respiratory effects of the two drugs studied were continuously and accurately recorded with a wet wedge spirometer throughout the procedure. The acute respiratory effects of these analgesic drugs could therefore be assessed. The measurements recorded before any surgical stimulation showed that both nalbuphine and meperidine produce a similar degree of respiratory depression. These results are at variance with earlier studies that drew conclusions from measurements that were neither continuous nor accurate. Nalbuphine was found to be a satisfactory analgesic adjuvant in this anesthetic technique.\r"

All patients had a thiopental, nitrous oxide/oxygen, pancuronium anesthetic with 200 microgram fentanyl intraoperatively. Postoperative pain relief was provided with fentanyl from a Janssen On-Demand Analgesic Computer (ODAC) set to provide a basal infusion rate of 20 microgram/hr, a bolus \"demand\" dose of 20 microgram, and a lockout period of 5 minutes. Frequent blood samples were collected immediately before patients demanded doses, and these were taken as an estimate of the minimum effective concentration (MEC). A mean of 22 samples (range 12 to 45) were collected per patient over a mean study duration of 50 hours (range 24 to 72). The patients required larger hourly fentanyl doses in the first 6-hour period (83.9 +/- 30.1 microgram/hr) than in any other 6-hour period (mean values varied from 37.3 to 63 microgram/hr). The mean (+/- SD) hourly fentanyl dose rate and total cumulative dose were 55.8 +/- 22 microgram/hr (range 28.8 to 136 microgram/hr) and 2739 +/- 1191 microgram (range 900 to 6260 microgram), respectively. The mean (+/- SD) MEC was 0.63 +/- 0.25 ng/ml (five-fold range from 0.23 to 1.18) and the mean intrapatient coefficient of variation in MEC was 30.2% (range 16 to 46%). The MEC values remained relatively constant in all patients over the 48-hour study period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Differences between milrinone and amrinone were also studied during enflurane anesthesia in six other dogs given milrinone or amrinone at 3- to 4-week intervals using both a low dose that did not decrease mean arterial pressure significantly and a dose that decreased mean arterial pressure 20-25% below baseline values. There was a dose-related effect with both drugs on the measured hemodynamic variables. Plasma catecholamine levels did not change significantly in either group. The results of our studies show that during enflurane anesthesia 1) there is a correlation between milrinone plasma levels and improvement of cardiac performance and, 2) milrinone, at low and high doses studied without or with a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure, respectively, is similar to amrinone in its activity to improve cardiac performance by similar positive inotropic, chronotropic, and vasodilating effects.\r"

The rates of the increase in cyanide ion concentration in all six solutions were fairly constant between 4 and 24 hours. At 24 hours, there were no statistically significant differences in cyanide ion concentration among the six solutions. After 24 hours, the rate of the increase in cyanide ion concentration in the electrolyte solutions decreased more than that in the nonelectrolyte solutions. At 72 hours, the electrolyte-containing solutions had statistically significant lower mean cyanide ion concentrations than 5% dextrose, often the recommended diluent for sodium nitroprusside.

The magnitude of the slope of the ventilatory response to hypoxia (VE vs SaO2) decreased from 1.48 +/- 0.24 to 0.70 +/- 0.13 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1) (means +/- SE, P less than 0.005) after midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV. The calculated ventilation at an arterial saturation of 90% also decreased from 28.6 +/- 4.4 to 19.9 +/- 2.7 L/min (P less than 0.05). Before midazolam, hypoxia to an SaO2 of 75 +/- 2% was associated with a 23 +/- 3 beats/min increase in heart rate; after midazolam, the increase in heart rate with hypoxia was only 4 +/- 2 beats/min (P less than 0.001). Additionally, a double-blind crossover study evaluated the effect of physostigmine on awareness and hypoxic ventilatory response after midazolam. The change in hypoxic response slope after physostigmine 2.0 mg IV (an increase of 0.28 +/- 0.34 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1] did not differ significantly from that after placebo (an increase of 0.03 +/- 0.22 L.min-1.%SaO2(-1], although physostigmine significantly increased awareness. It is concluded that a sedative dose of midazolam depresses hypoxic ventilatory response and attenuates the hyperpnea and tachycardia associated with hypoxemia. Furthermore, physostigmine-glycopyrrolate reversal of midazolam-induced sedation was associated with nausea (five subjects), vomiting (three subjects), and tachycardia without reversal of the depressed hypoxic ventilatory response.\r"

Lidocaine (4 mg/kg) or saline was given by nebulizer in the holding area beginning at -15 minutes. The patient underwent a standardized induction of anesthesia that included IV curare (3 mg) and O2 by facemask at minute 2, followed by IV thiopental (5 mg/kg) and succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) at minute 5. Lidocaine (2 mg/kg) or saline was given by IV push at minute 4. Laryngoscopy was begun at 5 minutes and continued for 45 seconds before intubation. Heart rate and systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were automatically recorded at 1-minute intervals from 0 to 11 minutes. The four treatment groups included: group 1, aerosolized and IV saline; group 2, aerosolized saline, IV lidocaine; group 3, aerosolized lidocaine, IV saline; and group 4, aerosolized and IV lidocaine. There were no differences among the four treatment groups (n = ten per group) in any of the four hemodynamic variables before laryngoscopy and intubation. Within each group, after intubation all four hemodynamic variables increased significantly over the corresponding baseline values for that group. However, the maximum values attained after intubation did not differ significantly among the four treatment groups for any of the four hemodynamic variables, whether those maxima were expressed as absolute values or as a percentage of baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, a controversy exists over the role of halothane in liver injury; does it act by reducing hepatic blood flow, thereby inducing hypoxia, or do its metabolites initiate the injury? These variables are difficult to separate during in vivo halothane exposure. In the present experiments, effects of halothane on hepatic perfusion were eliminated by exposing confluent monolayers of hepatocytes isolated from Fisher 344 rats livers, both with and without phenobarbital pretreatment, to 1.5% halothane or 2.0% isoflurane in 1%, 2%, or 4% (control) oxygen. Isoflurane exposure was included for a control of anesthetic effects on hepatocytes, because it is known to be metabolized minimally and probably is not associated with hepatic dysfunction. Oxygen levels were chosen to approximate those that may occur in the liver in vivo. Cell death was assayed via aspartate aminotransferase (AST) release, both immediately following a 2-h oxygen +/- anesthetic exposure and 6 h post-exposure. Per cent cell death data were analyzed using multiple regression techniques. Results obtained immediately, and 6 h after, exposure demonstrate that low oxygen levels, halothane, and phenobarbital were each highly significant factors (P less than .001) in relation to cell death, in agreement with the halothane-phenobarbital-hypoxia rat model. A toxic effect of isoflurane was not observed under identical experimental conditions. The results of the study clearly indicate that the origin of cell death in hepatocyte monolayers is multi-factorial; hypoxia, phenobarbital induction, and halothane exposure each contribute to the hepatocyte damage observed in our in vitro model.\r"

The levels of phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and ATP during rest, graded exercise, and post-exercise recovery were measured in their forearms. MH susceptible subjects had significantly (P less than 0.001) higher Pi/PCr values (0.222 +/- 0.009) at rest than did normal controls (0.140 +/- 0.004). In addition, a significantly (P less than 0.01) slower post-exercise recovery rate was found in the MH-susceptible group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the relationship of work rate to Pi/PCr. These data suggest that unchallenged MH susceptible patients can be distinguished from normals using 31P NMR spectroscopy. The potential use of this technique as a non-invasive tool in determining MH susceptibility is discussed, as well as the possible mechanisms underlying the observed 31P NMR abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of enflurane (ENF), halothane (HAL), and isoflurane (ISO) on specialized atrioventricular (AV) conduction times were contrasted to awake (control) in 22 chronically instrumented dogs. Dogs were studied with and without diltiazem (DIL), nifedipine (NIF), vehicle for NIF (VEH), or verapamil (VER). These calcium channel blockers (CCB) were administered iv to achieve clinically effective steady-state plasma levels in awake dogs. CCB plasma levels in awake dogs, subsequently anesthetized with ENF (N = 10), HAL (N = 10), or ISO (N = 11), were: DIL = 94 +/- 13 to 124 +/- 9 ng/ml, NIF = 4 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 2 ng/ml, VER 108 +/- 23 to 147 +/- 9 ng/ml. Anesthetized dogs had approximate two-fold increases in plasma levels of DIL or VER. There was no anesthetic effect on plasma levels for NIF. In the absence of CCBs, HAL increased AV nodal conduction time (AVN) compared to awake. There was a 4-10% increase in His-Purkinje (HP) and ventricular (VENT) conduction time with each anesthetic. The CCBs did not alter HP or VENT in awake dogs, but AVN was increased 15-23% by DIL and 28-38% by VER. Three of ten dogs with VER developed complete heart block or AV junctional escape rhythm at each level of ENF. One dog with VER developed type I, 2 degrees (Wenckebach) AV block at each level of HAL and ISO. No dogs with DIL had heart block or escape rhythms during anesthesia. In anesthetized dogs without heart block or escape rhythms, the increase in AVN with VER ranged from 46 to 69%, and with DIL from 36 to 55%. The CCB had no added effects on HP or VENT with any anesthetic. Finally, there were no effects of NIF alone or with the anesthetics on specialized conduction that could not be attributed to VEH. The authors conclude that with the inhalation anesthetics, antiarrhythmic plasma levels of DIL or VER prolong AV nodal most compared to infranodal conduction time. Additionally, heart block or escape rhythms appear more likely with VER and any of the potent inhalation anesthetics.\r"

Urea production did not differ in the two treatment groups, but halothane depressed albumin and transferrin synthesis 43% and 45%, respectively. Intact rats were also exposed to halothane, after which albumin synthesis was measured by the (14C)carbonate technique. The minimum halothane concentration required to insure sufficient relaxation for ventilation was selected and ranged from 1.0 to 1.5%. Measurements were made in control rats not exposed to halothane (group I) and in halothane exposed rats immediately after 1 h of anesthesia (group II), 24 h after the start of 1 h of anesthesia (group III), and immediately after 1/2 h of anesthesia preceded by a 1-h exposure 24 h earlier (group IV). Single exposures to halothane (groups II and III) resulted in a decrease in albumin synthesis immediately or 24 h later that did not differ significantly from controls (group I). However, halothane given twice to rats at 24-h intervals (group IV) reduced their mean albumin synthesis rate to half that of controls. The early onset and constancy of halothane depression of export protein synthesis by isolated, perfused livers may reflect a response to halothane itself, rather than an effect resulting from the accumulation of halothane metabolites. Similarly, reduction of albumin synthesis in intact rats immediately after a second halothane exposure may indicate a response to halothane, rather than to halothane metabolites.\r"

Post-rest potentiated-state contractions were elicited by imposing a stimulus at precisely timed intervals following a 2-Hz steady-state stimulus train. The strength of these contractions is known to be highly dependent on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release. The increment in tension developed in potentiated state, as compared to the steady state, is directly attributed to the potentiation process, and is defined here as potentiated-state strength (PSS). Effects of enflurane, halothane, and isoflurane on the time course of development of the potentiated state were characterized, as were the effects of incremental doses of these anesthetics on PSS. Anesthetic gas phase concentrations that produced 50% depression of contractile tension at 0.05 Hz steady-state stimulation were 0.6% halothane, 1.4% isoflurane, and 1.6% enflurane. Muscles exhibited maximal PSS of 0.91 +/- 0.01 g/mm2 in the absence of anesthetics. Halothane (0.6%) and enflurane (1.6%) caused significant depression of PSS to 0.45 +/- 0.06 and 0.61 +/- 0.06 g/mm2, respectively, while isoflurane (1.4%) preserved PSS at 0.95 +/- 0.09 g/mm2. Concentration profiles showed that the depression of PSS by halothane and enflurane was dose dependent. Isoflurane, up to 2.3%, failed to depress PSS. The time interval for development of optimum PSS, 1.5 to 2.0 s, was unaffected by any of the anesthetics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The arteries, obtained after hysterectomy, were dissected free from surrounding tissue, and arterial rings were prepared and mounted in tissue chambers filled with Kreb's-bicarbonate solution. Isometric tension was recorded. At concentrations of 10(-9) M to 10(-5) M, both nitroprusside and hydralazine produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the contractile response to norepinephrine. Nitroprusside and hydralazine were more potent in relaxing arteries contracted by a lower concentration (3 X 10(-6) M) of norepinephrine than by a higher concentration (10(-5) M) of norepinephrine. Regardless of the concentration of norepinephrine, nitroprusside was considerably more potent than hydralazine. The concentrations of nitroprusside that produced 50% inhibition (IC50) of the contractile response to norepinephrine (3 X 10(-6) M) in uterine arteries from pregnant and nonpregnant patients were 3.2 +/- 0.5 X 10(-9) M (n = 5) and 1.2 +/- 0.1 X 10(-9) M (n = 6), respectively. The IC50 values for hydralazine acting against norepinephrine (3 X 10(-6) M) in the uterine arteries from pregnant and nonpregnant patients were 5.1 +/- 0.5 X 10(-7) M (n = 5) and 4.0 +/- 0.5 X 10(-7) M (n = 6), respectively.

At 1.0 MAC end-tidal level, both sevoflurane and isoflurane caused a significant reduction in cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen of about 50%. Neither anesthetic caused a significant change in global cerebral blood flow or cortical cerebral blood flow during either 0.5 or 1.0 MAC administration. However, both sevoflurane and isoflurane caused small but significant increases in intracranial pressure during 0.5 MAC and 1.0 MAC administration. The electroencephalogram of animals anesthetized with 1.0 MAC of either anesthetic demonstrated a burst suppression pattern with no evidence of spike or seizure activity. The data suggest that the effects of sevoflurane on cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, intracranial pressure, and the electroencephalogram are indistinguishable from those of equivalent concentrations of isoflurane in the rabbit.\r"

Hill coefficients derived from dose-response curves were less than one for morphine or halothane alone, while it was 1.4 for the combination. The pA2 values (a measure of affinity of the antagonist for the opioid receptor) for naloxone in the absence and presence of halothane (1.6%) were 9.4 and 9.1, respectively. These results indicate that 1) halothane increases the potency of morphine in the guinea pig ileum at clinically relevant concentrations, 2) the interaction between the agents is synergistic, and 3) halothane does not modify the binding of naloxone to opioid receptors, but may affect membrane or intracellular processing of the receptor signal.\r"

  ".W": "Patch clamp techniques have been used to study the effects of ketamine on single-channel currents activated by acetylcholine from cell-attached patches of BC3H1 mouse tumor cells grown in culture. Ketamine decreased the average lifetime of the channels, although its effects were not consistent with a sequential blocking model in which molecules of drug bind to the open channel to occlude it. The reduction in channel lifetime produced by ketamine was dose dependent and occurred at clinically relevant concentrations. At 3 microM, which is the plasma level attained after an intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg, average channel lifetime should be reduced by about 17%. This finding may help to explain clinical reports that ketamine can potentiate neuromuscular block produced by vecuronium or d-tubocurarine. In addition, similar effects on transmitter-activated channels in the central nervous system may underlie some of the clinical properties of ketamine.\r"

Saturation was determined spectrophotometrically (Radiometer OSM-2). P50 computed from this PO2 and measured saturation was increased 5% (P less than 0.01) when blood was tonometered with N2O, but not in blood samples taken during N2O anesthesia and then equilibrated without N2O. Halothane and enflurane had no effect. 2,3 DPG was not affected by any agent. The authors conclude that inhalational agents in use today do not cause the oxygen dissociation curve to change in a way which might jeopardize the patient's oxygenation.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclic 3':5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) mediated facilitation of neuromuscular (NM) transmission was previously implicated in the mechanisms of the reversal of nondepolarizing NM relaxants by azathioprine (AZA). This interaction of d-tubocurarine (dTC) with AZA was re-examined in rats and correlated to changes in cAMP in the same muscle. Three groups of animals were studied: controls, low-dose AZA (5 mg/kg), and high-dose AZA (50 mg/kg). After AZA or saline administration, dose-response (DR) curves for inhibition of gastrocnemius twitch tension by dTC were constructed. Contralateral gastrocnemius muscle was sampled for cAMP levels. In another group of animals, the response to 5- and 50-mg/kg boluses of AZA was recorded during a steady-state twitch depression maintained with an infusion of dTC. No significant shift in the DR curve of dTC was observed following low- and high-dose AZA. During steady-state twitch depression, high-dose AZA, however, caused a transient reversal of twitch lasting 5-10 min. High-dose AZA caused a significant (P less than 0.006) elevation of cAMP levels (340 +/- 49 pmol/mg prot) compared to control (120 +/- 18) and low-dose (163 +/- 24) AZA groups. These studies, therefore, document transient reversal of twitch tension by 50 mg/kg doses of AZA during a steady-state dTC infusion. On the other hand, AZA administered prior to dTC in low (5 mg/kg) and high (50 mg/kg) doses failed to cause a significant shift in the dTC DR curve. A three-fold increase in skeletal muscle cAMP induced by high-dose AZA does not alter dTC DR curves.\r"

Cine CT LVEF was measured by means of two methods of edge detection (M1 and M2). A significant correlation was found between single-plane angiography and cine CT LAV LVEF (M1, r = .96; M2, r = .93). A lesser correlation was found for catheterization vs TAV cine CT LVEF (M1, r = .77; M2, r = .81). There was no significant difference between the two methods of edge detection for determining LVEF (M1 vs M2: LAV, r = .98; TAV, r = .94); however, there was significant variability in cavity volumes. Therefore, the LAV is superior to the TAV for measurement of LVEF by cine CT; however, different methods of edge detection, though affecting volumes, may not affect LVEF.\r"

Patients were stratified into four groups based on their two-dimensional echocardiogram: hyperdynamic, normal, mildly reduced, and severely reduced. Echocardiographic estimates of left ventricular function were compared with their ejection fraction measured by the gated radioisotope technique. The authors found that 48% of the patients were either normal or hyperdynamic (38% and 10% respectively). Patients in these two groups had a greater incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (wall thickness greater than 13 mm) (66% vs 39%, p less than .05), hypertension on admission (BP greater than 160/100) (66% vs 41%, p = .05), and smaller end-diastolic dimension (p less than .05) than those with decreased left ventricular function. The authors conclude that echocardiography is a good screening test of left ventricular function in patients presenting with pulmonary edema. Patients with normal or increased left ventricular systolic function should be evaluated for correctable or treatable causes of acute pulmonary edema.\r"

In males, the decrease in the ratio with age was due to a significant decrease in ASP with age (r = -0.52; p less than 0.001), whereas BSP did not increase significantly with age. In females, a different result was observed, since only BSP (and not ASP) was significantly (and positively) correlated with age. In both sexes, the diameter of the terminal abdominal aorta measured by echocardiography was significantly increased with age, and full examination with Doppler ultrasound excluded any significant arterial stenosis of the lower limbs. The study provided evidence that age- and sex-related changes in arterial wave transmission do exist in normal subjects.\r"

We suppose a double mathematical pendulum with forced and damped oscillations, with the first frequency equal to four times the second one; not only, does the system not give resonance or beatings, but it also simulates with reasonable approximation the ratio between natural relative frequencies. The two Langragian equations, that have form: (formula; see text) cannot be solved in an analytical way, even if we suppose an approximation for little oscillations.

  ".W": "In earlier investigations it has been found that high arterial blood pressure of salt-sensitive DAHL rats (DAHL-S) that received a diet containing 8% NaCl could be normalized by chronic treatment with specific calcium antagonists, as for instance, nitrendipine or anipamil. Parallel measurements on heart and arterial vasculature with atomic absorption spectrometry revealed that there was a rise in absolute calcium content upon development of hypertension, whereas under the influence of nitrendipine, not only the blood pressure and heart weight but also myocardial (and arterial) tissue calcium content remained in the physiologic range. In the present study, an additional determination of the free intracellular calcium ion concentration with Ca-sensitive microelectrodes was carried out. For technical reasons, the measurements were restricted to isolated resting rat papillary muscles (stretched to optimal length in a perfusion bath of 1.5 ml at 30 degrees C in normal Tyrode solution). The impalement of the electrodes was considered adequate when the heights of Ca potential and membrane potential were constant for more than twenty minutes. In order to produce severe systemic hypertension, a group of six-week-old DAHL-S rats was fed with an 8% NaCl diet over five weeks. Another group of DAHL-S rats received additionally 150 mg/kg nitrendipine twice a day orally. Salt-resistant DAHL-R rats, also fed with an 8% NaCl diet, served as controls. The findings of this preliminary study are as follows (n = 5 in each group): (table; see text).\r"

The right ventricle was divided into two chambers by hypertrophic muscular bands at the coronal planes. This finding was confirmed by selective angiography, and the pressure gradient in the right ventricle was 98 mmHg. Thus, MRI should be performed in the case of right ventricular obstruction to evaluate the site and extent of obstruction before cardiac catheterization.\r"

Repeated dose studies to evaluate chronic toxicity in rodents revealed few drug-related findings. A dose-related body weight gain suppression occurred in mice receiving up to 160 mg/kg for thirteen weeks. Rats also exhibited decreased body weight in a fifty-two-week study. Depressed fasting glucose levels were seen in rats at 50 mg/kg after thirteen weeks, but this effect was less prominent following fifty-two weeks of dosing. No other drug-related signs of toxicity were seen in rodents. Four-week repeated-dose intravenous studies in rats were uneventful. Occasional emesis and salivation, together with dryness of the oral mucosa, occurred in dogs given 10 mg/kg intravenously for four weeks. Drug-related increased heart rates, increased QRS duration, and reduced ST interval were seen thirty minutes postdose in dogs receiving 5 mg/kg or more intravenously. When dogs received pirmenol orally for fifty-two weeks, electrocardiographic and heart rate changes were variable and less pronounced than seen in the intravenous study. Clinical signs consisted of exaggerated pharmacologic responses similar to those found after intravenous dosing. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits showed that pirmenol is not teratogenic. Reduced food intake and a 50% decrease in body weight gain were seen in rats at the top dose level of 150 mg/kg. Significantly reduced mean fetal weight and increased postimplantation loss indicated that 150 mg/kg was embryotoxic to rats. A top dose of 50 mg/kg in rabbits did not produce any signs of maternal or fetotoxicity, aside from a moderate suppression of maternal weight gain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Baseline measurements of heart rate, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, systemic arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular stroke work, and ejection fraction were obtained. An infusion of pirmenol hydrochloride was administered and hemodynamic measurements were repeated an average of 16.1 minutes following the start of the infusion after a new stable hemodynamic state was achieved. Significant increases in heart rate and systemic arterial pressure were noted. There were no significant changes in cardiac output, pulmonary arterial pressure, or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Significant reductions in left ventricular stroke work and ejection fraction were demonstrated. The amount of decrease in the ejection fraction was not related to the plasma pirmenol level achieved or to the baseline level of ventricular function. These findings suggest a negative inotropic effect of acute infusions of pirmenol and suggest caution should be used in its administration to patients with compromised left ventricular performance.\r"

Fifteen swine weighing more than 15 kg were instrumented for measurement of regional MBF using radiolabeled tracer microspheres. Measurements of regional MBF, MDO2, and MVO2 were made during normal sinus rhythm. Ventricular fibrillation was induced and persisted for ten minutes. CPR was begun using a pneumatic compression device. Regional MBF, MDO2, and MVO2 were measured during CPR. Following three minutes of CPR, animals (N = 15) were allocated to one of three groups (n = 5): Group 1, epinephrine 0.2 mg/kg; Group 2, phenylephrine 0.1 mg/kg; or Group 3, phenylephrine 1.0 mg/kg.

Fourteen communities (service area populations, 4,000 to 36,000) in rural south-eastern Minnesota participated in a two-year crossover study to further define the factors necessary for success. Automatic external defibrillators were used to defibrillate and record patient rhythms in the treatment group and to only record in the control group. Although six of 36 patients (17%) in ventricular fibrillation who experienced a witnessed arrest survived in communities using automatic external defibrillators, compared with one of 27 (4%) in the control group, five of the six survivors were from a single large community with a 911 system, full-time emergency medical technicians, police first-responders, and a well-equipped emergency facility. Our data suggest that certain prerequisites, especially CPR prior to ambulance arrival and collapse to defibrillation times of less than ten minutes, are clearly essential to produce significant benefits from emergency medical technicians trained in defibrillation in rural communities.\r"

We wished to determine the oxygen cost of the increased elastic work of breathing associated with acute lung injury. Extracorporeal venous circulation with a membrane lung was used to extract CO2 and to induce apnea in 14 anesthetized pigs. Data were collected during 4 experimental states: during spontaneous ventilation and apnea when the animals' lungs were normal, and after acute lung injury developed because of oleic acid administration. Acute lung injury decreased lung compliance from 101 +/- 79 (mean +/- SD) to 52 +/- 25 ml/cm H2O (p less than 0.04), and increased the elastic work of breathing from 700 +/- 590 to 1,060 +/- 630 ml.cm H2O (p = 0.01). During spontaneous ventilation, the increases in total O2 consumption and the O2 cost of breathing caused by acute lung injury were sufficiently small as to be undetectable, and, therefore, less than 3 to 4% of basal O2 consumption despite markedly increased elastic work and ventilatory power requirements. The increase in O2 consumption imposed by acute lung injury was small enough (less than 3 to 4% of total O2 consumption) that it appears to be clinically insignificant.\r"

The entire cohort was screened at the time of entry, and isoniazid preventive therapy was offered according to ATS-CDC guidelines. During the period of study, 25 cases of tuberculosis were reported from the cohort. The 5-yr cumulative incidence of tuberculosis (26.8 cases per 10,000 in the entire cohort) was greatest in tuberculin-positive refugees who had abnormal screening chest roentgenograms (324.3 cases per 10,000) and least in those with nonsignificant tuberculin reactions (5.0 cases per 10,000). The annual incidence of tuberculosis in the cohort decreased from an estimated 30.6 cases per 10,000 at the time of immigration to less than 5 cases per 10,000 during the fourth and fifth years. The prevalence of resistance to isoniazid was greater in culture-positive cases arising after immigration (7 of 22, 32%) than in those diagnosed at the time of immigration (5 of 36, 14%), probably because of a reduction in isoniazid-susceptible cases by isoniazid preventive therapy. Currently recommended screening and preventive services may be favorably impacting tuberculosis morbidity in newly arriving refugees from Southeast Asia.\r"

For identifying likely deceivers about cigarette smoking among self-reported never smokers and former smokers, we used cutoff values of 20 ng/ml and 8 parts per million (ppm) for salivary cotinine and carbon monoxide, respectively. Among males and females, age-standardized prevalences of current smokers based upon questionnaire reports were 30.9 and 27.1%, respectively. After adjustment for cotinine alone, these percentages were 36.2 for males and 31.1 for females, and after adjustment for cotinine and carbon monoxide level, the corresponding percentages were 39.1 for males and 33.2 for females. We conclude that self-reports about smoking habits may lead to underestimation of the prevalence of current smokers and that questionnaire responses should be validated with biologic markers of tobacco smoke exposure.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of lung cancer as a result of exposure to diesel exhaust from railroad locomotives was assessed in a cohort of 55,407 white male railroad workers 40 to 64 yr of age in 1959 who had started railroad service 10 to 20 years earlier. The cohort was traced until the end of 1980, and death certificates were obtained for 88% of 19,396 deaths; 1,694 lung cancer cases were identified. Yearly railroad job from 1959 to death or retirement was available from the Railroad Retirement Board, and served as an index of diesel exhaust exposure. Directly standardized rates and a proportional hazards model were used to calculate the relative risk of lung cancer based on work in a job with diesel exhaust exposure beginning in 1959. A relative risk of 1.45 (95% CI = 1.11, 1.89) for lung cancer was obtained in the group of workers 40 to 44 yr of age in 1959, the group with the longest possible duration of diesel exposure. The cohort was selected to minimize the effect of past railroad asbestos exposure, and analysis with workers with possible asbestos exposure excluded resulted in a similarly elevated risk. Workers with 20 yr or more elapsed since 1959, the effective start of diesel exposure for the cohort, had the highest relative risk. These results taken in conjunction with other reported results support the hypothesis that occupational exposure to diesel exhaust results in a small but significantly elevated risk for lung cancer.\r"

About 25% of the subjects responded with a decrease in baseline FEV1 of 10% or more after challenge with histamine in a concentration of 16 mg/ml or less inhaled over 30 s (PC10). In a stratified analysis, pulmonary function level appeared to be associated with BR in a dose-response relationship. The mean %FEV1 was consistently lower in the more responsive subjects. This relationship was confirmed in linear regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, area of residence, and smoking habits. Exclusion of subjects with %FEV1 less than 80% diminished but did not change the association between FEV1 and BR. The magnitude of the effect of responsiveness on level of pulmonary function was considerable and statistically significant. In the subjects older than 21 yr of age, male responders (PC10 at less than or equal to 16 mg/ml) on average had an adjusted FEV1 of 32.5 centiliters less than nonresponders, and female responders had an adjusted FEV1 of 30.5 centiliters less (p less than 0.001). BR appeared to be an independent predictor of pulmonary function level after adjustment for age, sex, area of residence, respiratory symptom prevalence, and cigarette smoking. The effect of cigarette smoking on pulmonary function level in this population sample was significant only in men older than 21 yr of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We measured [K+] and FEV1 in 13 healthy control and in 13 asthmatic subjects pre-exercise, at peak exercise (within 1 min of stopping exercise), and 10 min postexercise. This was done on 2 separate days, one with and one without bronchodilator (BD) pretreatment. Both groups were equally fit, exercising to the same O2 consumption and heart rate. Resting [K+] was normal for both groups (two-day averages were 4.00 +/- 0.07 and 4.09 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, mean +/- SEM, in control and asthmatic subjects, respectively). Without BD pretreatment, at peak exercise, [K+] in control subjects rose by 0.56 +/- 0.08 compared with 0.96 +/- 0.09 in asthmatics (p less than 0.01). After exercise, [K+] returned to baseline (4.12 +/- 0.08) in control subjects but remained elevated in asthmatics (4.60 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.01). Although FEV1 was unchanged in control subjects, in asthmatics it fell after exercise (p less than 0.01). With BD pretreatment: peak exercise [K+] increased by 0.55 +/- 0.09 in control subjects, and by 0.49 +/- 0.01 in asthmatics (p less than 0.01). By 10 min postexercise, it returned to baseline in both groups (4.15 +/- 0.11 for control subjects and 4.32 +/- 0.07 for asthmatics). The asthma group's fall in FEV1 was also abolished. These data indicate that postexercise K+ remains elevated in asthmatics, supporting the suggestion that their adrenergic function is impaired.\r"

Each subject was studied on 4 separate days. EH was performed for 4 min at a minute ventilation found previously to increase specific airway resistance (SRaw) by 8 units (cm H2O/L/s). All exercise challenges were performed on a cycle ergometer for 5 min at a constant work load. Subjects breathed room temperature, dry air for both stimuli. SRaw was serially measured before and after each stimulus. Tolerance was examined by giving up to 3 repetitions of EH or EX, allowing a return of SRaw to within 1 unit of baseline between repetitions. Placebo (P) or I (25 mg four times a day for 7 doses) was administered in a single-blind manner. The timing between stimulus repetitions on the P day was matched to that of the I day. After P, the initial rise in SRaw was similar for both EX and EH, with a significant and progressive decrease in this rise after each stimulus repetition (p = 0.032 for EX, p = 0.006 for EH). After I, tolerance was still demonstrated to EH (p = 0.002), but not to EX (p = 0.231). This finding indicates that EH and EX are not identical stimuli, since there is an I-sensitive mechanism (possibly a bronchodilating prostaglandin) associated with the development of tolerance to EX but not to EH. Our data also suggest a possible additional bronchoconstricting mechanism associated with EX and not with EH.\r"

Bronchoalveolar eosinophilia were inhibited by prophylactic administration of the antiasthma drug ketotifen but not by pyribenzamine, suggesting that the effects of ketotifen are unrelated to H-1 receptor antagonism. Platelet accumulation was not affected by ketotifen or pyribenzamine. This study suggests that paf-acether may be a mediator of the eosinophil recruitment in bronchial asthma and that inhibition of this phenomenon by ketotifen may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of this drug.\r"

In the infants with chronic lung disease, a 20 to 25% reduction in FIO2 caused acute hypoxemia (O2 saturation, 77 +/- 8%) and an associated decrease in mid-expiratory flow from 103 +/- 55 to 69 +/- 37 ml/s (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.05) in the absence of a significant change in tidal volume or skin-surface CO2 tension. In the infants without lung disease, breathing 17% O2 led to a significant increase in minute ventilation (26 +/- 25%; p = 0.05), but there was no consistent change in mid-expiratory flow. To further study the effects of an acute reduction in FIO2 on pulmonary function in infants with chronic lung disease, we measured lung mechanics in 6 infants and end-expiratory lung volume in 5.

Group A consisted of 6 asthmatics (2 females and 4 males, 56.0 +/- 6.4 yr of age, mean +/- SEM); Group B consisted of 6 bronchitics (3 females and 3 males, 53.8 +/- 6.5 yr of age). Between Groups A and B, there was no significant difference in sputum volume per day or in obstructive impairment. Radiolabeled albumin concentration (cpm/ml) was obtained from radiocount of each sputum sample and then divided by serum concentration at the time of each sampling (2, 4, 6, and 8 h after administration). Group B showed large values compared with those in Group A. In Group A, the ratios were 2.0 +/- 0.8, 2.5 +/- 0.5, 2.2 +/- 0.2, and 1.5 +/- 0.4% (mean +/- SEM) at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after the administration, respectively, whereas in Group B, the ratios were 3.0 +/- 0.6, 7.0 +/- 1.8, 7.2 +/- 1.8, and 7.4 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The differences between Groups A and B were statistically significant (two-way analysis of variance). These findings suggest that an increase in airway mucosal permeability is due to mucosal epithelial damage by chronic inflammation in bronchitics and not to the underlying abnormality of asthma.\r"

Maximal static respiratory mouth pressures were also recorded, and rib cage and abdominal movements were monitored with pairs of magnetometers. Sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure was abnormally low in all patients and was correlated with transdiaphragmatic pressure during other maneuvers, and with maximal static inspiratory mouth pressures. There was no relationship between the severity of dyspnea and transdiaphragmatic pressure in the group as a whole. The weakest patients had orthopnea and paradoxical inward inspiratory motion of the anterior abdominal wall; measurements suggested that at least 30 cm H2O transdiaphragmatic pressure was required to overcome the hydrostatic pressure of the abdominal contents. By contrast, patients with mild diaphragm weakness had neither orthopnea nor abdominal paradox. Thus, patients with breathlessness and diaphragm dysfunction may have varying degrees of diaphragm weakness that may be difficult to detect clinically; the diagnosis and quantification of diaphragm weakness requires the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure.\r"

Despite their lack of sleep-related symptoms and normal daytime blood gas tensions, periods of hypopnea and/or apnea (H/A) were observed in all patients (mean frequency 9.6/h; range, 3.7 to 17.0; mean duration 23.1; range of means, 16 to 36 s). In 9 patients, between 0.5 and 12.3 oxygen desaturations of greater than 5% occurred per hour, with falls from a mean SaO2 baseline of 95.4 +/- 0.6% (SEM) to a mean nadir of 74.2 +/- 3.9% (range, 58 to 90). This desaturating group (n = 9) showed longer and more frequent H/A than did the 5 nondesaturators; the proportion of REM sleep occupied by H/A was 37.7 +/- 3.8% in the desaturating group compared with only 15.1 +/- 5.1% in the remainder (p less than 0.01). The severity of sleep-disordered breathing could not be reliably predicted from daytime pulmonary function test results, and only maximal static expiratory pressure appeared significantly lower in the desaturating group. Hypopneas were associated with reduced chest wall movement in all subjects, and with chest wall paradox in one; continued submental \"inspiratory\" EMG activity throughout \"central\" apneas in 2 subjects suggested that these episodes were not truly central in origin. Sleep hypoxemia is imputed in the progression of several chronic respiratory diseases, and its prevention in Duchenne and related neuromuscular diseases may influence morbidity and mortality.\r"

We consequently compared the percentage of total sleep time in which phasic activity of the genioglossal EMG activity was present in 8 adult patients with OSA and 3 control groups without OSA, one consisting of 6 young, normal subjects, one matched for age, and one matched for age and obesity. From wakefulness to sleep, genioglossal EMG phasic activity time increased in patients but not in control subjects. Patients with OSA had more phasic genioglossal group EMG activity during non-REM sleep than did control subjects. At apnea onset, phasic EMG activity decreased in patients but remained greater than zero. In many control subjects, phasic activity was not detected, yet their pharyngeal airway remained patent. We conclude that phasic genioglossal group EMG activity occurs more frequently during sleep in patients with OSA than in control subjects, suggesting that it is a compensatory mechanism that occurs when patency of the pharyngeal airway is precarious.\r"

There is disagreement about the definition and significance of such sleep-related hypopneas. We have thus analyzed breathing patterns, oxygenation and sleep records of 50 consecutive patients referred with the clinical features of the sleep apnea syndrome and found to have abnormal breathing during sleep to determine: (1) the best definition of hypopnea, and (2) how frequently patients have the clinical features of the sleep apnea syndrome without recurrent apneas. Hypopnea definitions based on decreases in thoracoabdominal movement yielded hypopnea frequencies that were significantly closer to desaturation and arousal frequencies than hypopnea definitions based on flow reduction. The best hypopnea definition was that of a 50% reduction in thoracoabdominal movement lasting for 10 s. This was validated in 33 normal subjects, all of whom had fewer than 11 hypopneas/h, and fewer than 14 apneas plus hypopneas/h of sleep. Thirty-two of the 50 patients had 10 or more apneas/h, the remaining 18 having 9 to 98 hypopneas/h such that all patients had more than 16 apneas plus hypopneas/h. Patients with recurrent hypopneas were clinically indistinguishable from and had a similar frequency of 4% desaturations (zero to 104/h) and arousals (7 to 98/h) to the patients with frequent apneas. This study confirms that hypopneas are clinically important and that the \"sleep apnea syndrome\" may occur in the absence of recurrent apneas.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of whole virus influenza vaccination on theophylline pharmacokinetics was evaluated in 16 normal subjects. Because previous reports had suggested that influenza vaccine induces interferon production and may potentially depress hepatic metabolism of theophylline, serum interferon concentrations were monitored for 6 days after vaccination. Lymphocytes from 6 subjects were incubated in vitro with dilute whole virus vaccine (WVV) or dilute split virus vaccine (SVV) to assess their immunocompetence and the immunogenic potential of the 2 vaccine preparations. Additionally, influenza antibody response was monitored by prevaccination and postvaccination serum antibody titers in 11 subjects. No significant change in half-life, total body clearance, volume of distribution of maximal serum theophylline concentration compared to prevaccine values was observed at either 2 or 6 days after vaccination. No interferon production was detected in vivo up to 6 days after vaccination. In vitro lymphocyte interferon induction assay demonstrated mean interferon levels of 12,252 +/- 9,819 IU/ml for WVV and 888 +/- 1,180 IU/ml for SVV (p less than 0.05), demonstrating the immunocompetence of the subject's lymphocytes and confirming the greater immunogenic potential of WVV. Seven of 11 subjects (64%) showed a 4-fold rise in influenza antibody titer to at least one of the vaccine antigens. We conclude that whole virus influenza vaccine does not alter theophylline pharmacokinetics. In addition, it has greater immunogenic potential than split virus vaccine in vitro but does not induce significant interferon production in vivo. This study adds further evidence supporting the safety of the concomitant use of influenza vaccine in patients taking theophylline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Lung infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae causes the recruitment of many granulocytes (PMN) to the alveoli, but little damage to lung structure ensues, as opposed to infections with other bacterial species that induce a similar PMN response and cause lung damage. Elastase, a proteolytic enzyme of PMN, has been implicated as an agent of lung injury. We studied the interaction of different bacterial species with human PMN in vitro to determine if PMN elastase activity is affected by the species of bacteria ingested. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae were grown, opsonized, and incubated with human PMN. After 1 h of incubation, intracellular and extracellular elastase activity was measured. S. pneumoniae reduced PMN elastase activity by 48%, whereas the other 3 species tested had only minimal effects on elastase activity. Loss of elastase activity occurred with S. pneumoniae: PMN ratios as low as 2:1. Adherence or ingestion of bacteria by the PMN was necessary for the decrease in elastase activity to occur; interventions that decreased phagocytosis, such as not opsonizing the bacteria, pretreatment of the PMN with cytochalasin B, and separation of bacteria from PMN by 0.22-mu filters, increased elastase activity. ELISA and Western blot analysis of elastase levels in these experiments suggested that normal amounts of elastase were present. Thus, the loss of elastase activity we observed may be due to an elastase inhibitor present in S. pneumoniae.\r"

Exposure lasted for 6 h per day; it began 2 consecutive days prior to instillation of MCMV and continued for 4 days after virus inoculation. Exposure to 5 ppm NO2 resulted in MCMV proliferation and a mild bronchopneumonia in some animals inoculated with 10(2) plaque-forming units of virus. Importantly, this inoculum was too low to produce either viral replication or histologic abnormalities in the lungs of air-exposed animals. We also found that the amount of virus required to infect animals exposed to 5 ppm of NO2 was 100-fold lower than that needed to consistently produce infection in air-exposed animals. Animals exposed to 5 ppm NO2 also exhibited depressed phagocytosis of colloidal Au198 in vivo as well as diminished macrophage destruction of instilled MCMV compared to air-exposed animals. These results demonstrate that exposure to 5 ppm NO2, although not associated with evidence of overt lung injury per se, is nevertheless capable of predisposing the lower respiratory tract to viral infection.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether lung elastin is lost during the evolution of cadmium-induced air-space enlargement with pulmonary fibrosis, the lung elastin of 5- to 7-day-old golden Syrian hamster pups was radiolabeled by giving [3H]valine. At maturity, a single intratracheal instillation of 0.5 ml of 0.025% CdCl2 solution was given. Lung mechanics, histologic examination, and biochemistry were studied 5, 10, 21, 42, 105, and 180 days after the cadmium treatment. The animals developed fibrosis and air-space enlargement with decreased lung volumes, compliance, and forced expiratory flow; their functional residual capacity was increased. The total lung collagen and total lung elastin were increased, but there was no loss of radiolabel in lung elastin. We conclude that CdCl2-induced air-space enlargement with pulmonary fibrosis is not accompanied by loss of neonatally formed lung elastic fibers. We hypothesize that air-space enlargement with fibrosis represents a stereotyped response of the lung to fibrosing injuries, which we hypothesize is due to forces from more fibrotic and atelectatic areas causing overdistension of less abnormal air spaces. The air-space enlargement of fibrosing human diseases such as sarcoidosis and eosinophilic granuloma may have a similar basis. Evidence is reviewed that human centrilobular emphysema may be a form of focal air-space enlargement with interstitial fibrosis; there may be mechanisms in addition to elastase-antielastase imbalance that cause human emphysema.\r"

  ".W": "The morphologic changes in the centriacinar region of lungs from 14 rats exposed to either filtered air (8) or 0.95 ppm ozone (6) 8 hours daily for 90 days were examined morphologically and morphometrically. Rats were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital administered intraperitoneally, the trachea cannulated, and thoracic viscera and lungs removed from the chest. Lungs were fixed via intratracheal instillation of a paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde cacodylate buffered fixative at 30 cm water pressure. Lung volumes were determined by weight displacement and the left lung lobe was sectioned transversely into 12 slabs. Three slabs from the cranial, middle, and caudal thirds of the lobe were embedded in paraffin and studied by light microscopy. With these sections, we estimated the volume of proximal bronchiole, terminal bronchiole, respiratory bronchiole, and combined alveolar duct/sac within the lung. Bronchioles dissected from preselected regions of the right middle lobe were studied by transmission electron microscopy. Dissected terminal airways were sectioned in a longitudinal plane through their midlumen. From these dissected airways, 4 subregions of the centriacinus were then examined: (1) terminal bronchiole, (2) respiratory bronchiole, (3) centriacinar alveolar duct wall, and (4) centriacinar alveolar septa. The results of this study showed that after chronic ozone exposure, there was a 13 to 21% decrease in terminal bronchiole luminal diameter but no significant change in total terminal bronchiole volume. The most notable change was a 3.4-fold increase in respiratory bronchiole volume. Analysis of measured volume and diameter changes in the terminal bronchiole, coupled with volume increases in respiratory bronchiole, support the conclusion that respiratory bronchiole (RB) is formed from the centriacinar alveolar duct. Morphologic parameters supporting this conclusion included the presence of fused basement membrane beneath reactive bronchiolar epithelium in the RB, the presence of similar basal laminar changes in both the RB and proximal alveolar duct septal tips, and the observation that most severe epithelial damage and inflammation occurred in the most proximal alveolar duct rather than in the terminal bronchiole. A major conclusion of this study is that the focus of the most severe injury within the acinus appears to shift distally as respiratory bronchiole segments are formed. Hence most of the damage occurs at the tips of alveolar septa at the respiratory bronchiole-alveolar duct junction.\r"

Using these ELISAs, we tested sequential tracheal aspirates from infants severely ill with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who had been treated either with exogenous surfactant or with placebo within 8 h of birth. On average, we found low concentrations of surfactant proteins in tracheal aspirates on Day 1 of life, with increases evident by Day 3. The surfactant used in this study (TA surfactant) contains only the low molecular weight (6 kDa) surfactant proteins and not the 35 kDa surfactant protein. As we expected, those who were treated with TA surfactant more frequently had detectable concentrations of low molecular weight surfactant protein on the second day of life when compared with control infants. No differences were evident in the concentrations of surfactant proteins between the 2 groups by Day 3, nor were differences evident between the 2 groups evident for 35 kDa surfactant protein during the first 3 days of life. Increased low molecular weight surfactant proteins in tracheal aspirates 1 to 2 days after surfactant therapy may occur either because of persistence of exogenous surfactant proteins and/or enhanced surfactant protein production. Comparisons with measurements from other groups of patients with RDS confirm that absence of both surfactant proteins reflects alveolar surfactant deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "We describe 3 patients in whom biliopleural fistulae complicated percutaneous biliary drainage. All patients had complete obstruction of their biliary tree because of malignancy. Biliopleural fistulae developed as a complication of inadvertent catheter removal in 2 patients and of catheter dysfunction in the third. Early reinstitution of biliary drainage and successful drainage of the pleural space led to complete recovery in all patients. An animal model to evaluate the effects of bile in the pleural space in normal rabbits revealed rapid absorption of bilirubin, the production of a polymorphonuclear-predominant exudative effusion with extremely high LDH levels, and resolution with a macrophage influx. We conclude that biliopleural fistulae are heterogeneous in their presentation, depending upon the persistence of biliary drainage into the pleural space, the volume of exudative effusion, and the presence of suppurative complications.\r"

All patients had additional injuries, including pelvic fracture (13), extremity fractures (10), central nervous system (5), bladder (5) and rectal injury (3); the average injury severity score was 30. Pelvic fracture patterns included ten patients with a crushed pelvis, two with single anterior pelvic ring fractures and one with a double vertical fracture. Blood at the urethral meatus was noted in only five patients, gross hematuria without metal blood in another three, and a displaced prostate on rectal exam was found in 10 cases. All patients had a suprapubic cystostomy for management of the urethral injury. Thirteen of 14 patients survived (93%). The major complication was perineal sepsis. Based on this experience, it is concluded that: 1) the classical findings of urethral injury are not found consistently, 2) certain pelvic fracture patterns, particularly disruption of the anterior pelvic ring, are frequently associated with urethral injury and 3) aggressive and appropriate management of hemorrhage, pelvic fracture and concomitant injuries is important to minimize mortality.\r"

There were no hemodynamic nor neurologic complications secondary to RSI or oral endotracheal intubation.

With the recent push for improvement in emergency medical services and specialized trauma centers for this age group, more moribund patients can be expected to reach these centers. Multiple reports document the efficacy of resuscitative thoracotomy in the moribund adult trauma victim, but published reports of this technique in children and adolescents are lacking. From January 1981 to July 1986, 19 patients ranging in age from 4 to 18 years (mean 14) underwent resuscitative thoracotomy. Eleven patients sustained penetrating trauma while eight sustained injuries from blunt trauma. Five patients survived and were discharged from the hospital (26%). There were no survivors in the 0-15 year age group in five penetrating injuries and four blunt trauma victims. This review confirms the efficacy of resuscitative thoracotomy in the patient with penetrating trauma. Salvage in the blunt trauma victim is possible, but less than in penetrating injuries (12.5% versus 36%). Further studies in this age group will be necessary to establish appropriate guidelines for the use of RT in children and adolescents.\r"

The incidence of associated farm-machinery injuries and fatalities is increasing at an alarming rate with the majority occurring in young boys during the summer months. Between 1979-1985, 234 patients with traumatic injuries were admitted to our Pediatric Surgery Service. Seven of these, six boys and one girl, age ranges from 2-15 years were treated for severe farm-related injuries. Modified injury severity score was calculated with an average score of 31.5 (range 9-66). Four patients sustained or required amputation of a major extremity(ies) as a result of the injury. Two patients had multiple long bone fractures with associated neurologic or abdominal injury. One patient exsanguinated from massive liver lacerations. Five of the six surviving patients are disabled to varying degrees because of their injuries. This report provides support for the establishment of federal safety standards for farm-related equipment. Guidelines for prevention are outlined. We believe that the child physician is obliged to encourage education programs in farming communities on safety measures and further should endorse the application for farms.\r"

Between June 1984 and July 1986, nine patients sustaining rupture of the diaphragm due to blunt trauma were treated. All were injured in high-speed motor-vehicle accidents. Six patients arrived in shock (SBP less than or equal to 95 mm Hg). All patients had multiple associated injuries; mean ISS = 41.5. Eight patients (89%) had associated intra-abdominal injuries, the spleen being injured most frequently (63%). Associated thoracic injuries occurred in six patients (67%). The admission CXR was abnormal in eight patients (89%) but diagnostic of diaphragmatic rupture in only four. DPL was positive in four of five patients (80%) and falsely negative in one. Seven ruptures were left-sided, one right-sided and one involved the central tendon. All injuries were diagnosed shortly after admission and successfully repaired via a transabdominal approach. One patient died as a result of a massive subdural hematoma. Blunt diaphragmatic rupture is an indication of a high-energy insult and is usually associated with other major organ system injuries. An aggressive approach to the management of the multiply injured patient can result in early recognition and successful treatment of this injury.\r"

With the development and designation of trauma centers, two problems have become evident. First is a reliable, simple means of triaging patients to the appropriate facility. The second problem is evaluation of the quality of care provided. The assessment of results is difficult due to the large number of variables, such as mechanisms of injury, anatomic sites of injury, and comorbidity found in these patients and has led to the use of complex statistical analysis. The trauma score, originally developed as a triage tool, has also proven to be a reliable, simple means of assessing the quality of care. The expected survival for each trauma score value has been established and each hospital's or surgeon's results can, therefore, be evaluated against that standard. A deviation from the expected survival curve may or may not be clinically significant as determined by careful review of those patients. From July 1, 1985 through June 30, 1986, 495 patients were admitted to the trauma service at the Medical College of Georgia. All patients were given a trauma score on arrival to the emergency department. The trauma score can be used as a quality assurance tool by any physician or hospital providing trauma services as will be demonstrated by analyzing our data.\r"

Less attention has been paid to early septic postoperative complications in the splenectomized patient. Associated colon injury has been believed to be a relative contraindication to splenic conservation. If splenectomy enhances the chance of early postoperative infection, then associated colon injury should be an indication for splenic salvage One hundred sixty one patients who had either splenic trauma (58), colon trauma (90), or combined spleen-colon trauma (13) were studied. All patients with splenic trauma had a splenectomy. There was a significantly higher incidence of intra-abdominal sepsis requiring reoperation in the spleen-colon patients (46.7%) than in either of the other groups (spleen = 5.7%, colon = 8.9%, P less than .002 for both comparisons). It is concluded that splenectomy enhances infection in the early postoperative period.

The present study was done to review our experience with CT in staging pancreatic cancer, specifically its efficacy in predicting lesions amenable to curative versus noncurative surgical treatment. Sixty six consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer who were considered potential candidates for surgical resection and who had preoperative CT scans over the 4-year period from 1982 through 1986 were studied. Preoperative CT scans were reviewed by a radiologist without knowledge of patients' surgical management. CT criteria for unresectable disease include hepatic and distant metastasis as well as evidence of locally advanced disease, including peripancreatic fascial extension, extension of tumor to locally contiguous structures, vascular encasement/invasion, and local lymphadenopathy. CT predicted resectability with a sensitivity of 75 per cent and a positive predictive value of 38 per cent. Unresectability was predicted with a sensitivity of 72 per cent and positive predictive value of 93 per cent. CT incorrectly predicted unresectable disease in three patients who had a curative resection. CT was most reliable when it predicted unresectability due to the presence of hepatic and/or distant metastasis. CT predicted unresectability with least sensitivity using criteria for locally advanced disease. Therapeutic decisions for nonoperative management of patients with pancreatic cancer based upon CT predictions of unresectable disease, especially predictions of unresectability solely on the basis of locally advanced disease, can not be recommended at this time.\r"

While surgical resection offers the only hope for long-term cure, unsuspected bilobar metastases or extrahepatic metastatic disease may be found at laparotomy, precluding hepatic resection for cure. In this setting intraoperative interstitial hepatic irradiation using the Gamma Med II (Mick Radio-Nuclear Instruments, Bronx, New York) remote afterloading irradiator and an Iridium-192 source permits delivery of a tumoricidal dose to liver tumor(s) with a limited radiation dose to adjacent normal liver. Six patients underwent laparotomy for potential resection of hepatic metastases in a shielded operating room equipped with remote anesthesia monitoring capability and were found to be unresectable. An upper hand retractor facilitated liver exposure during the exploratory and subsequent radiation phases of the procedure. Intraoperative interstitial radiation therapy was performed in each patient. No significant complications occurred on follow-up from 2 to 9 months. Hepatic tumor regression or stabilization occurred on sonography and/or CT scan in each case with a median follow-up of 5 months. The technique offers the potential to ablate discrete tumor nodules within the liver. Ongoing clinical trials will determine the role of intraoperative interstitial radiation in the treatment of hepatic metastases.\r"

The usefulness of this procedure was studied in thirteen patients with suspected hyperparathyroidism. The scan accurately localized the site of abnormal parathyroid glands (nine adenomas and eight hyperplastic glands) in 91 per cent of the patients. Localization was most successful in adenomas weighing more than 500 mg. We conclude that dual radionuclide scintigraphy is useful in the preoperative location of enlarged parathyroid glands.\r"

All subjects were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant trimipramine in a double-blind study, each subject acting as his own control. All subjects were evaluated with pure tone audiometry, site of lesion testing, and auditory brain stem evoked response. The tinnitus assessment consisted of frequency and intensity matching, the determination of masking levels, and a subjective evaluation of severity. Plasma levels of trimipramine were monitored at regular intervals, and the Zung and Millon inventories were administered at the beginning and end of each study period. Nineteen subjects completed the study. Within the trimipramine group, one reported complete disappearance of his tinnitus, eight reported improvement, three no change, and seven that tinnitus was worse. Within the placebo group, eight reported improvement, seven no change, and four that tinnitus was worse. The natural history of tinnitus is such that what has been observed may reflect the evolution of the disease itself, rather than the effect of treatment. We feel that while tricyclics may not have been shown to be effective, the placebo effect played a significant role in the results obtained.\r"

Results indicate that both procedures produce unique and degenerative effects that are still apparent 3 weeks after operation; however, nervous elements in lased tissue samples appeared less disrupted than in stripped tissue. Unique effects on the composition of epithelial tissue also were noted for the two procedures. Implications for voice quality in human patients undergoing similar procedures are discussed.\r"

Three patterns of laryngeal appearance during phonation were observed: vocal fold adduction, associated ventricular fold constriction, and approximation of the laryngeal inlet. Eight of 13 subjects demonstrated some neurologic abnormality. For the majority of subjects, the airflow demonstrated marked variability during sustained phonation; for different subjects, this variability was observed to be associated with either an oscillatory or irregular airflow pattern. The modal speaking fundamental frequency for the women and men with adductor spastic dysphonia was not significantly different from that for age- and sex-matched controls.\r"

These findings indicated that ciliary anomalies, including deletion of ciliary microtubules, presence of supernumerary tubules, and fusion of cilia, occur as a result of infection or inflammation. Such abnormalities would impair normal mucociliary clearance and exacerbate clinical complications.\r"

In our study, the pressure changes were determined by catheters placed into the nasopharynx and repeated tympanometric measurements. New information concerning the rapid pressure variations in the nasopharynx and middle ear during deglutition with an obstructed nose was obtained. Typical individual nasopharyngeal pressure change patterns were recorded, ranging from a maximal positive pressure of +450 to a negative pressure as low as -320 mm H2O.\r"

Although the overall tolerance was good, therapy was interrupted in one atopic patient because of pruritus. There were no undesirable laboratory changes in values. Thirty-five milligrams of acitretin daily provided the best efficacy, with minimal side effects. The beneficial effect of this retinoid lasted between four and six weeks after therapy was stopped. These results suggest that acitretin is a useful agent in the symptomatic therapy of severe recessive x-linked ichthyosis resistant to topical therapeutic modalities. Good results with this agent can be achieved with interval therapy adjusted to seasonal variations of the skin symptoms.\r"

The 2-year-old girl showed the early manifestations of PLS; that is, slight gingival swelling and erythema occurring simultaneously with minimal scaling of palms and soles. The other siblings, aged 5, 8, and 11 years, showed severe periodontopathy with tooth loss and marked palmoplantar keratoderma with a centripetal extension of the keratoses to the limbs and trunk. These three older siblings were treated with acitretin (Ro 10-1670), the free acid of etretinate, with complete clearing of the skin and healing of gingival pockets. Treatment was given for 16 months; teeth that erupted during therapy were free of periodontopathy and remained firmly anchored to the alveolar bone. In two of the children ultrastructural examination of involved skin was performed before and during acitretin treatment. Before treatment a large number of lipidlike vacuoles were found in corneocytes and in granulocytes; tonofilaments were reduced in number, and keratohyaline granules frequently showed a rectangular or globular shape. During treatment with acitretin these abnormalities diminished markedly. Thus, etretin is effective in treating PLS and, if treatment is started at an early age, should allow patients with PLS to have normal adult dentition.\r"

Anthralin in 0.0125% clobetasol propionate was found to be an effective agent in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, and one that was cosmetically acceptable to patients and nursing staff. An important disadvantage, however, was the development of a staphylococcal folliculitis in four of the 35 patients in which it was used. Because of this, anthralin in Lassar's paste remains our standard inpatient therapy, although the ease of use and cosmetic acceptability of anthralin in clobetasol propionate make it a useful remedy for outpatient use.\r"

Histologically, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis was seen at the spinous and granular layers. Electron microscopy showed the aggregation of tonofibrils and an early appearance of keratohyaline granules as well as vacuolar formation in the epidermal cells. Some of these morphologic abnormalities were detected even in the basal cells. The decrease of 67-kilodalton (kd) keratin and the appearance of 48-kd keratin were noted by using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Genetic analysis of the keratin gene family using 67-kd keratin complementary DNA by Southern blot analysis revealed the conserved gene organization of the 67-kd keratin gene. These findings suggest that undetermined regulatory abnormalities of keratinization, but not the gene structure itself, may be causative factors of this rare disease.\r"

Fifteen of the 18 cases had reduced ciliary beat frequencies (less than 10 Hz) associated with dyskinesia and the other three showed apparent absence of ciliated cells. Of the 15 cases with reduced ciliary beat frequencies, ciliary ultrastructure was normal in seven cases but abnormal with missing dynein arms and occasional abnormalities of microtubular arrangement in eight. Respiratory symptoms in the perinatal period were more common in children with abnormal ciliary function and present in all those with ultrastructural abnormalities or absence of ciliated cells compared with 34 (26%) of 132 children, in whom symptoms were recorded, with normal ciliary function. This study would suggest that all children with unexplained chronic respiratory disease, in particular those with symptoms starting in the perinatal period, should be investigated for ciliary dyskinesia.\r"

A fall in PEFR of greater than 15% in at least two postexercise readings was defined as abnormal. Six (1%) children did not do the test and 69 (14%) failed to complete it. Of these, 14 were known asthmatics, 18 were not testable, and 37 were normal when retested. There were 14 abnormal FRAST results among 412 'normal' children who completed the test and 10 of these were subsequently diagnosed asthmatic. None of 14 children with an abnormal FRAST result had been identified as wheezy, chesty, or asthmatic in the questionnaire. In this sample there was, on average, one child in every school class with unrecognised exercise induced bronchospasm. The FRAST is an acceptable, feasible, and cost effective way of identifying such potential asthmatics at school.\r"

Eighteen infants provided one or more 24 hour recording of heart rate (electrocardiography), thoracic respiration (transthoracic impedance), and abdominal wall movement (pressure sensitive capsule distortion). Detection of true apnoea, recognition of artefact, and measurement of the duration of true apnoea were all improved when two channels of respiratory monitoring were used in combination. We recommend that any study purporting to observe breathing patterns by indirect recording of respiratory movement will be more reliable if more than one channel of respiratory movements is recorded simultaneously. Further, in infants no estimation of duration of central apnoea can be made on the basis of either a transthoracic impedance record alone or an abdominal wall movement sensor alone. Comparison of findings among studies using different single channel recordings are unlikely to be meaningful.\r"

In 18 of 22 children, aged 2-5 years, who were too young to have their peak flow rate measured reliably, terbutaline administered via this modified nebuhaler technique was also associated with a clinically important change in functional residual capacity. The results suggest that effective bronchodilation using a nebuhaler can be achieved even in very young children.\r"

Using these results and those of protein loading tests that diagnosed heterozygote (carrier) status in some family members, some carriers were detected, and prenatal diagnosis was offered to two families. In two further families no polymorphisms were found and no prenatal diagnosis was possible. In the remaining two families prenatal diagnosis was impossible because of the lack of DNA from an affected or unaffected son, or in one case from the father, of an obligate carrier. These studies emphasise the importance of preserving tissue for DNA extraction from infants dying of inborn errors of metabolism, and also show the way in which information from conventional biochemical studies can complement diagnostic tests using DNA.\r"

There has been an increased recognition of the role of accidents and injuries in child health and the importance of accident prevention at an international, national, and local level. This has, in part, been a result of work undertaken by the Child Accident Prevention Trust. Much remains to be done, however, and doctors and other health workers involved with children must recognise the part that they can play in reducing this epidemic. Mortality and morbidity from accidents is the largest single problem in the health of children after the first year of life. The aim of this article is to stimulate interest in the problem of accidents in childhood especially among community paediatricians and clinical medical officers. Hospital doctors and general practitioners also have a particular part to play in drawing the attention of appropriate authorities to factors which have led to accidents that may have been preventable (see Annotation in this issue).\r"

Three patients with blocked cervical subarachnoid space on myelography underwent laminectomy using local anesthesia. All three cases improved significantly after surgery. The usefulness of laminectomy in selected cases of cervical cord compression due to fluorosis is suggested.\r"

In this area, SO2 originates mainly from a coal-fueled power plant. The mean SO2 level during the winter was 22 micrograms/m3 in low-pollution areas and 93 micrograms/m3 in polluted areas, with daily SO2 levels up to 356 micrograms/m3. Children completed a daily diary about respiratory symptoms. In the polluted communities only we demonstrated a significant association between daily SO2 levels (after controlling for temperature and respirable particle variations) and prevalence of upper and lower respiratory symptoms. However, in each polluted town, and for each respiratory symptom, there was no evidence for either a latency period or a delay in the effects of pollutants. Mean daily temperature was also closely correlated with upper and lower respiratory symptoms in most of the polluted and some low-pollution communities. In a second step, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in each town was compared, during two 2-wk periods, with air pollution levels; higher prevalences were found during the pollution period. In conclusion, moderate daily changes in SO2 levels induce a significant but transient increase in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in children.\r"

Eight different dusts were analyzed for element contents and grain size: one rural and three urban airborne dusts, a coarse and a fine fraction of a sieved waste incinerator fly ash, a sonicated coarse fly ash fraction, and the standard quartz dust DQ 12. The fine fly ash fraction, the sonicated coarse fly ash fraction, and the quartz dust DQ 12 enhanced elastase release by activated AM. Only one of the tested airborne dusts effected a comparable elastase release. The untreated coarse fraction of the fly ash did not cause a significant increase of extracellular elastase activities. Elastase release was dependent on particle numbers and chemical composition and correlated best with barium and tin contents. Nonactivated AM released higher elastase activities than activated AM at low-dose levels. The possible role of dust-induced elastase secretion in the pathogenesis of emphysema is discussed.\r"

Of the more than 50 scores from the neurological examination, abnormalities were demonstrated among the cases only on measures of memory, abstraction, and mood, and on one test of motor reflexes. Differences between the two cohorts were much more apparent in the neuropsychological tests. The differences occurred on tests of widely varying abilities including intellectual functioning, academic skills, abstraction and flexibility of thinking, and simple motor skills. Twice as many cases as controls (24 vs. 12) had Halstead-Reitan Battery summary scores in the range characteristic of individuals with cerebral damage or dysfunction. Results from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the Patient's and Relative's Assessment of Patient Functioning Inventories also revealed greater distress and complaints of disability for the poisoned subjects.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the acute prophylactic efficacy of albuterol aerosol in protecting nonasthmatic athletes from the untoward effects of 0.21 ppm ozone (O3) on symptoms, pulmonary function, exercise performance, and post-exposure histamine bronchoprovocation. Fifteen trained competitive cyclists participated in a randomized crossover study consisting of double-blinded inhalations of albuterol (180 micrograms) and placebo approximately 30 min prior to heavy continuous exercise (minute ventilation, [VE] greater than or equal to 80 L/min) for 60 min, followed by a maximal sprint (peak VE greater than 140 L/min) until exhaustion. Each subject was exposed randomly to either 0.21 ppm O3 or filtered air (FA) during the four single-blinded exposure sessions. Albuterol pretreatment resulted in modest but significant bronchodilation as compared to placebo. However, albuterol did not prevent O3-induced respiratory symptoms, decrements in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in one second (FEV1.0), and maximum midexpiratory flow rate (FEF25-75%), and positive histamine challenges as compared to that with placebo/O3. There were no statistically significant differences in the metabolic data or ride times across all drugs and exposures, although the peak VE was significantly lower with O3 than FA (142.3 vs. 150.7 L/min, respectively) regardless of drug. The results indicate that acute pretreatment with inhaled albuterol is unable to prevent or ameliorate O3-induced symptoms and alterations in pulmonary function and exercise performance. The contribution of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the acute airway responses to O3 appears to be minimal.\r"

Six homes yielded Legionella pneumophila within the water distribution system. Lower water temperatures (less than 48.8 degrees C) within the hot water system were significantly associated with the presence of L. pneumophila colonization. A similar association was found for electric heaters; however, this association may be an indirect one. Water temperatures in electrically heated tanks were significantly lower than in gas-heated tanks. City residences were also more likely to be colonized than suburban residences. Because acquisition of Legionnaires' disease in the community has been linked to colonization of the water supplies in the homes of affected patients, these findings may have clinical implications for susceptible individuals residing in homes with water supplies colonized by L. pneumophila.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred sixty-five patients with biopsy-proven benign breast disease were followed annually in a prospective manner for 4-15 years to analyze breast cancer development, recurrence, and efficacy of management during follow-up. Eleven breast cancers developed in 11 patients during follow-up, giving a 2.6-fold increased cancer risk over the reference population. No association was found between patients who developed cancer and those who did not with respect to the initial histologic feature (p = 0.62), the age at entry by decades (p = 0.40), and relative to menopause (p = 0.54), the presence of cysts (p = 0.87), or calcification (p = 0.74) in the biopsy specimen, a family history of breast cancer (p = 0.80), or the number of observation years (p = 0.27). We conclude that an aggressive approach to benign breast disease is not justified for any type of lesion as defined in this report. Benign breast disease does not inevitably lead to recurrence. Moreover, 41% of our patients never had any recurrence and were free of symptoms during follow-up; 67% never had a mammogram and 82% never required a further operation. There was no association with initial histologic feature in patients who had clinical examination only and those who had mammogram, biopsy, or both during follow-up (p = 0.93). Mammograms were mainly used to clarify a clinical recurrence than as a screening tool, regardless of histologic feature (p = 0.76). Mammograms were mainly used in premenopausal patients (p less than 0.001) having lumps (p less than 0.001), namely, the most difficult patients for radiologic interpretation. This may be one important reason for the rather low sensitivity (75%) and specificity (40%) of mammography in this report. In conclusion, clinical examination is the outstanding investigational tool to follow patients with biopsy-proven benign breast disease, especially in young premenopausal patients.\r"

  ".U": "88182440\r", 
  ".W": "Studies of associations between perioperative blood transfusions and later recurrence of solid tumors have yielded conflicting results. A previous analysis of transfused patients suggested that recurrence was associated with transfusion of whole blood as opposed to red blood cell concentrates. Additional analyses were performed on patients with cancers of the colon, rectum, cervix, and prostate to determine if patients receiving whole blood, red blood cells only, or no transfusions had differing outcomes. Patients receiving 1 unit or more of whole blood had uniformly poor outcomes compared with nontransfused patients (p less than 0.001). In contrast, patients receiving only red blood cells had progressively worse recurrence and death rates with increasing numbers of transfusion, suggesting the presence of a dose-effect relationship. Employing multivariate techniques, blood transfusion of less than or equal to 3 units that included any whole blood were independently and significantly associated with earlier recurrence (p = 0.003) and death due to cancer (p = 0.02). Transfusions of less than or equal to 3 units of blood comprised solely of red blood cell concentrates were associated with no greater risk of recurrence than that seen in patients receiving no transfusion (p = 0.50). These results provide a potential explanation for the disparate results reported in studies of blood transfusion and cancer outcome. The marked difference in outcome seen between patients receiving a few units of red blood cells and comparable patients receiving even one unit of whole blood are consistent with the hypothesis that transfusion of stored blood plasma causes earlier tumor recurrence in some instances. Strategies for reducing these risks might include avoidance of whole blood transfusions when only 1-3 units are required, more conservative transfusion practice, use of autologous blood transfusions, and perhaps, use of red blood cells washed free of plasma and white cell debris. Clinical trials to test these hypotheses are urgently needed.\r"

Following shock, five randomly assigned treatment groups received the shed blood plus 50 mL/kg of salt solution (RL) or RL with varying concentrations (0.22-1.5 gm/kg) of Hespan. Each dog received 50 ml/kg/d of the test solution for three days after shock. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, total serum protein, albumin, globulin, and coagulant protein activity of fibrinogen, prothrombin, and factor VIII were measured before shock, at the end of shock, following resuscitation, and on day 3; thoracic duct lymph values were obtained on day 3. Hespan-supplemented resuscitation lowered all serum proteins including albumin, globulin and coagulant proteins; concomitantly, the lymph protein rose after Hespan resuscitation. This decrease in serum proteins and rise in lymph proteins parallels similar results after albumin resuscitation in man and animals and suggests that Hespan induces an oncotically controlled extravascular protein relocation. Further studies on the significance of these findings need to be conducted.\r"

Fifty of the 66 patients had HbSS, 13/66 had HbSC, and 3/66 had HbS-thalassemia. All 66 patients received transfusions, although not for all procedures. In 48 patients, transfusion therapy was only administered preoperatively. Simple transfusions (1 to 10 units) were administered in 31 of 48 procedures. Exchange transfusions (1 to 6 units) were performed in nine of 48 procedures. Preoperative hematocrit ranged from 7.0% to 54.2%; of those receiving transfusions the hematocrit ranged from 22.6% to 53.7%. Intraoperative transfusions (1 to 10 units) were performed in 14 of 82 procedures; postoperative transfusions (1 to 6 units) were performed in 13 of 82 procedures. No advantage was noted in preoperative exchange transfusion as measured by a decrease in postoperative complications; a slight increase was seen in atelectasis in this group of patients with preoperative transfusions. An increase was reported in the complication rate of patients with an hematocrit of less than 30%. The type of transfusion (preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative) administered did not appear to be related to postoperative morbidity rates. The complication rate for simple transfusions was 51.6% and for multiple transfusions, 55.6%. HbSS hemoglobinopathy had the higher complication rate. The hepatitis B surface antigen was demonstrated in four of 66 (6.1%) patients; ten of 66 (15.2%) developed alloantibodies. The benefits of transfusion therapy should be judged according to clinical needs; not all sickle cell patients need exchange or preoperative transfusion.\r"

When the hypopharynx was completely stenosed (type II, N = 14), a transepiglottic approach consisting of partial horizontal laryngectomy was used because it allowed excision of the supraglottic stricture, restoration of the oropharyngeal cavity, anastomosis to the posterior oropharyngeal wall, management of an eventual laryngotracheal stenosis, and elevation of the laryngeal inlet above the digestive anastomosis. After operation, several endoscopic examinations were required, sometimes combined with reoperation. Return of deglutition assuring normal nutrition was obtained in 61% of patients: 3 of 4 type I and in 8 of 14 type II.\r"

A different surgical approach is proposed in this paper, avoiding both thoracotomy and encroachment upon thoracic mediastinal structures. This technique is based on the removal of the tumor and the esophageal mucosa above it as a distinct anatomic layer by blunt dissection through separate abdominal and neck incisions. This is followed by pulling upward a segment of stomach (or colon) through the esophageal muscular tunnel into the neck for a cervical anastomosis. This endoesophageal pull through (EEPT) approach has been used in the surgical treatment of a total of ten patients, six with adenocarcinomas of the cardia and four with squamous cell carcinomas of the lower esophagus. In nine patients the stomach, and in one patient the left colon, was brought to the neck to reestablish gastrointestinal (GI) continuity. The operation was well tolerated. There was no excessive intraoperative or postoperative bleeding, and there was no in-hospital mortality up to 30 days. The major postoperative complication was cervical anastomotic leakage seen in four patients. The EEPT technique is a palliative approach for cancers of the lower esophagus and cardia, comparing favorably with the standard extrathoracic or transthoracic transhiatal procedures.\r"

Of 162 evaluable histograms, 124 were diploid, 35 aneuploid, and 3 tetraploid. Aneuploidy strongly correlated with established predictors of unfavorable prognosis, namely, thickness p less than .005, level p less than 0.005, ulceration p less than 0.005, and presence of vertical growth phase p less than 0.02. Overall, aneuploidy was strongly correlated with recurrence (p less than 0.005) and shorter disease-free survival (p less than 0.0001). Aneuploidy was an independent predictor of recurrence for tumors less than 1.5 mm thick (p less than 0.0001) and greater than or equal to 3 mm thick (p = 0.031). For melanomas 1.5-2.9 mm thick, aneuploid tumors had a 27% higher recurrence rate than diploid tumors (63% vs. 36%). This was not statistically significant (p = 0.247). In a multivariate analysis of common predictors stratified by thickness, DNA aneuploidy was the most significant independent parameter (p less than 0.002). DNA content appears to be an important stratification parameter for Stage I cutaneous melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated a possible protective and therapeutic effect of moderate hypothermia in the treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock. A modified Wiggers shock preparation was used. Normothermic dogs (Group I, N = 6) were maintained at normal body temperature throughout hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. In Group II, hypothermia was initiated after 15 minutes of hemorrhagic shock (N = 12) and maintained for 60 minutes after fluid resuscitation. Animals were then rewarmed with Group IIA (N = 7) receiving sodium bicarbonate to correct acidosis, while Group IIB (N = 5) did not; all dogs were studied for an additional 120 minutes. During shock heart rate was lower in both hypothermic groups (IIA and IIB) compared to normothermic dogs (85.0 +/- 3.9, 77.7 +/- 4.6 vs. 136.7 +/- 4.2, respectively, p less than 0.05), while +dP/dt (mmHg/s) remained stable in all dogs. Furthermore, pH was lower in the hypothermic (Groups IIA and IIB) compared to normothermic animals at this time period (Group IIA: 7.19 +/- 0.02, Group IIB: 7.13 +/- 0.02 vs. Group I: 7.24 +/- 0.02). Arterial pCO2 was higher in the hypothermic hemorrhagic shock Groups IIA and IIB compared to normothermic group (34.5 +/- 2.2, 37.4 +/- 2.2 vs. 20.3 +/- 20,3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.05) due to hypothermia-depressed respiration. A higher myocardial O2 consumption and a negative myocardial lactate balance occurred in the normothermic animals during hemorrhagic shock. After resuscitation and rewarming, stroke volume (mL/beat) and cardiac output (L/min) were lower in hypothermic animals with persistent acid-base derangements (12.6 +/- 2.5, 1.3 +/- 3.0, respectively) compared to hypothermic dogs with acid-base correction (20.1 +/- 3.3, 2.2 +/- 0.3) and normothermic dogs (24.6 +/- 3.0, 3.0 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.05), while myocardial O2 extraction and myocardial lactate production were higher. Results suggest hypothermia decreases the metabolic needs and maintains myocardial contractile function in hemorrhagic shock. Hypothermia may have a beneficial effect and, with normalization of acid-base balance, a therapeutic role in hemorrhagic shock.\r"

Between 1981 and 1986, 35 patients with potentially resectable lesions were entered into the study. After chemotherapy, 13 of 35 patients (37%) had a complete clinical response, 7 (20%) had a partial response, and 15 (43%) had no response. One patient sustained a serious toxic reaction (renal failure). Twenty-seven patients underwent surgical resection, with 1 hospital death (3.7%). Selective postoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy was administered to 69%. The actuarial survival of all resected patients at 42 months was 54% (standard error, 10%). Multivariate analysis showed significant factors associated with 3-year survival were: (1) complete clinical response to chemotherapy; (2) absence of wall penetration in the specimen; and (3) microscopic or no disease in the specimen. We conclude that this multimodality treatment method improves the intermediate-term survival of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.\r"

At the 4-year and 8-year intervals, 91% and 80% of patients, respectively, were event free (not in need of further operative procedures). By multivariate analysis, the factor preoperative mild mitral regurgitation showed a tendency to influence the event-free period. By univariate analysis, postoperative mitral regurgitation significantly reduced the event-free period. Twenty-one patients subsequently underwent mitral valve replacement; 8 for mitral regurgitation, 10 for mitral stenosis, and 3 for mixed mitral regurgitation and stenosis. By multivariate analysis, the reason for reoperation significantly influenced the length of the event-free period. The patients with mitral regurgitation required mitral valve replacement sooner than those with mitral stenosis. Advanced age, sex, previous valvotomy, preoperative New York Heart Association Functional Class, low mitral valve leaflet excursion, and pulmonary hypertension had no influence on the long-term result.\r"

The overall hospital mortality was 16.1% (10/62) (70% confidence limits, 11.2 to 22.4%). By multivariate analysis, the risk factors for early and late death included increasing right atrial pressure after repair, use of an atriopulmonary connection, and previous pulmonary artery banding (all variables, p less than 0.05). Postoperative catheterization was performed in 22 patients including 15 with AV valved-conduit connections. Right ventricular (RV) work based on pulmonary artery pressure minus right atrial pressure was correlated with the preoperative RV to left ventricular volume ratio computed from the four-chamber angiographic projection (p = 0.025), and was appreciable only with ratios exceeding about 30%. In 6 of 19 eligible patients, severe conduit obstruction has developed. Considering the survival data, the risk of reoperation, and postoperative hemodynamic findings, analysis of our experience supports the preferential use of nonvalved AV connections in most patients with tricuspid atresia and ventriculoarterial concordance.\r"

  ".W": "Aortic stenosis accounts for 5 to 6% of infants and children seen for surgical repair of congenital heart disease. The clinical presentation and reported results of operation for aortic stenosis are highly variable. This retrospective review was undertaken to assess our operative mortality and the degree of gradient reduction afforded by each of several surgical techniques used to treat aortic stenosis in children over a 30-year period. Two hundred fifty-seven patients ranging in age from 1 day to 19 years were operated on between 1957 and 1986. The indication for operation included asymptomatic patients with gradients greater than 50 mm Hg to patients in profound cardiogenic shock. The operative mortality for children older than 6 months was 4%, whereas neonates seen with critical aortic stenosis had a 60% mortality. The late mortality was 2%. Eighty percent of surviving patients to date have undergone cardiac catheterization after repair. This shows an overall reduction of 57 mm Hg in the left ventricular-aortic gradient. Patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis and discrete subvalvular aortic stenosis as well as patients undergoing aortic valve replacement showed a reduction in or elimination of associated aortic insufficiency, whereas patients undergoing aortic valvotomy or neonates having valvotomy had a significant increase in demonstrable aortic insufficiency. The incidence of third-degree heart block or cerebral emboli following operation for aortic stenosis was less than 1%. However, the incidence of late bacterial endocarditis following repair was nearly 5%; six of eleven cases occurred in the group with discrete subvalvular aortic stenosis. Twenty-nine (13%) of the 223 long-term survivors have undergone a subsequent procedure for relief of residual or recurrent obstruction; 12 have had insertion of an aortic valve prosthesis, 12 have had insertion of an apicoaortic conduit, and 6 have required repeat aortic valvotomy. These data demonstrate the low operative mortality and excellent hemodynamic benefit of surgical relief of single-level aortic stenosis in children older than neonates. Conduits placed for complex obstructions or operative procedures in neonates have acceptable hemodynamic benefits, but operative mortality remains high.\r"

These patients underwent mitral valve repair by segmental transposition of the posterior leaflet with its attached chordae sutured to the free edge of the flail anterior leaflet. There were 2 hospital deaths. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 35 months (mean follow-up, 14.9 +/- 8.5 months). One patient is lost to follow-up. Two patients are in New York Heart Association Functional Class II; all others are in Class I. In 17 patients there is no detectable murmur; in 5 patients a mild to moderate systolic murmur can be detected, while 4 have a marked systolic murmur. The adequacy of the repair could be confirmed by Doppler echocardiography, which has shown no evidence of prolapse in 22 patients. A mild regurgitation jet is present in 4 patients, and a marked jet, in 3. Postoperative cardiac catheterization performed in 5 patients has confirmed the Doppler echocardiographic findings. Although longer follow-up is necessary, this technique appears adequate for repairing a major prolapse of the anterior leaflet caused by multiple ruptured or elongated chordae, therefore obviating the need for a prosthetic valve substitute.\r"

Early success was followed by closure of the pathways by fibrosis and scarring caused by mechanical trauma. The CO2 laser was examined as an alternative method of creating channels. Early experiments supported the hypothesis that laser channels would perfuse ischemic areas and would remain patent. Histological examination showed patent, endothelialized channels more than 2 years following operation in the experimental model. A clinical protocol was designed to assess the results of laser revascularization in a series of 12 patients. Patients selected were candidates for bypass grafting, but because of the coronary artery pathology involved, it was thought bypass grafting alone would result in incomplete revascularization. None of the 12 patients have died. Follow-up ranges from 3 to 32 months. Postoperative thallium stress tests and left ventriculography indicate that channels have remained patent and that they perfuse the myocardium. Direct laser revascularization of the myocardium may offer a viable adjunct in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.\r"

Cardiac output (CO) is calculated by computer as the change in bioimpedance over time. This study was performed to determine the accuracy of bioimpedance CO (CObi) compared with standard thermodilution CO (COtd) in an animal model and in patients. COtd was determined using a thermodilution CO computer, and CObi was calculated with a bioimpedance computer in 10 dogs at baseline and at 5-minute intervals following the injection of 7 mEq of calcium chloride. A high correlation between COtd and CObi was observed (r = 0.91, p less than 0.001) over a range of 2.5 to 6 L/min. Thirty-three paired observations using the CObi and COtd methods were performed in 10 patients following elective coronary artery bypass surgery. A significant correlation between the two methods was determined with a CO range of 2.1 to 7.8 L/min (r = 0.77, p less than 0.001). CObi became inaccurate with severe tachycardia (pulse, 180/min), low CO, or frequent arrhythmias. These results indicate that this technique provides a continuous noninvasive method of determining CO that is comparable with thermodilution techniques. The technique of CObi holds promise for widespread use when continuous and noninvasive monitoring of CO is necessary.\r"

Their mean age was 45.4 years (age range, 23-73 years), and they represented 46% of patients with hydatid cysts in the liver and thorax. Three patients had hepaticopleural involvement, and 3 patients had symptoms of pulmonary origin. In a single patient, only the diaphragm was involved along with the liver. Liver scintigraphy and ultrasonography were equally helpful in delineating the extent of the disease, but computed tomographic scanning is now the method of choice. The operations were through a thoracolaparotomy in 3 patients and a thoracotomy alone in 3 patients. A single patient had a thoracotomy with a transdiaphragmatic laparotomy. Complete drainage or excision of hydatid cavities was accomplished in all patients. Hydrogen peroxide instilled into the cysts was satisfactory for control of spread potentially secondary to possible intraoperative spillage. There have been no postoperative deaths. Follow-up has ranged from 6 months to 8 years, and 2 patients had relapsing hydatid disease 3 years postoperatively. These results suggest that, when hydatid disease of the liver is complicated by transdiaphragmatic extension and simultaneous pleural or pulmonary cysts, early surgical repair is indicated. Complete drainage and cyst excision are recommended.\r"

Fifty-six palliative operations had been performed previously in 43 patients. Twenty-nine patients received an atriopulmonary connection by direct anastomosis [19], interposition of an aortic homograft [7], or a porcine heterograft [3]. An atrium-subpulmonary chamber connection was performed in 21 patients (Bjork modification, 10; Dacron tube, 10; valved conduit, 1). Eleven patients (22%) died early, 6 of whom did not meet the established criteria for a Fontan operation. One patient died 6 months postoperatively of superior vena cava thrombosis. Four patients were reoperated on successfully. At a mean follow-up of 28.8 months, 28 patients are in New York Heart Association Functional Class I and 9 are in Class II; 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Thirteen patients underwent control catheterization fifteen days to four years postoperatively (median right atrial pressure, 14 mm Hg). Exercise testing in 9 asymptomatic patients, performed after a mean interval of 33 months, showed a moderate impairment of cardiac performance. We conclude that in select patients, a Fontan repair appears to be a reliable procedure at medium-term follow-up.\r"

The 1986 total represents an increase of 14% in ADR reporting over 1985, continuing a trend begun in 1981. While these increases are encouraging, US reporting rates are far below many other countries, and further encouragement of reporting must be done.

During the period of brand substitution, we observed an increase in the number of patients whose anticoagulation was poorly controlled. There was a concomitant increase in the number of clinic visits and an increased frequency of prothrombin time testing to regulate the dosage in such patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical and economic consequences of the change in brand of warfarin. Our results show that a significant increase in morbidity and overall health care costs resulted from this attempt to economize by changing brands of medication in our municipal hospital setting.\r"

The morphologic diagnosis of idiopathic PAL was established by means of open lung biopsy in 11 patients; the use of transbronchial biopsy was not considered in eight of them. Transbronchial biopsy was performed in six patients, and the diagnosis of idiopathic PAL was reliably established in five cases. We conclude that transbronchial biopsy may be a worthwhile preliminary procedure to open lung biopsy in patients with suspected idiopathic PAL, and it can reliably establish the diagnosis in such cases.\r"

We evaluated correlations between semiquantitative and quantitative measures of anisocytosis for different groups of observers. Hematologists', medical students', and medical residents' semiquantitative assessment of anisocytosis correlated with the quantitative red blood cell distribution width. The interobserver variability demonstrated that all observers correlated with each other, while the intraobserver variability of semiquantitative anisocytosis demonstrated that observers were more precise than could be predicted by chance. However, the extreme precision of the red blood cell distribution width strongly suggests that it should be the \"gold standard\" for measuring red blood cell size variability.\r"

Pulmonary embolism, as demonstrated by angiography or autopsy, was present in 36 (21%). The need for objective testing is clearly indicated by our finding that the sensitivity (85%) and specificity (37%) of predetermined clinical variables for pulmonary embolism were insufficient to allow a definitive treatment decision. Optimal sensitivity and specificity are obtained by using pulmonary angiography in combination with lung scanning. The proportion of patients requiring angiography is substantially reduced, from 43% to 26%, without significant loss of accuracy, if ventilation imaging and impedance plethysmography are used together with perfusion scanning.\r"

The skills rated as the most important in practice were history taking, physical examination, and selection of diagnostic tests. For 13 of the 27 clinical procedure skills, mean preparation scores were significantly higher than mean importance scores, suggesting \"overpreparation.\" In contrast, seven of the eight clinical practice skills had mean preparation scores significantly lower than mean importance scores, suggesting \"underpreparation.\" Furthermore, greater preparation during training was reported by more recent graduates for five of the overprepared skills. We concluded that skills emphasized in internal medicine training are not necessarily those important for practice and that recent changes in the training and practice environments may be increasing these discrepancies.\r"

During the first six days of the outbreak, 14 (25%) of 55 residents developed influenzalike illness. The risk of illness was most strongly associated with undetectable levels of antibody against the epidemic strain, with unvaccinated case-patients having more severe illnesses and a higher rate of hospitalization than vaccinated case-patients (5/8 vs 0/6). During the period of amantadine hydrochloride prophylaxis (100 mg/d) from days 7 to 35, only two (5%) of the remaining 41 residents became ill, even though 11 (27%) had no detectable antibody. Serum amantadine levels obtained on day 35 ranged from 117 to 737 ng/mL (mean 309 ng/mL), similar to therapeutic levels documented in younger adults who have taken the standard regimen of 200 mg/d; there were few clinically significant side effects. These findings illustrate the benefits of influenza vaccination and support the use of amantadine hydrochloride at a dosage of 100 mg daily for outbreak control among elderly persons.\r"

Six obese, diabetic women ranging from 143% to 297% of ideal body weight were studied in a metabolic ward for 48 days. The subjects ingested a weight-maintenance diet during an eight-day control period followed by 40 days of an experimental diet containing 1764 kJ (420 kcal) of a mixture of protein (43% of energy intake), carbohydrates (51%), and fat (6%), supplemented with minerals, trace elements, and vitamins. The subjects were monitored for balances of nitrogen and minerals, as well as for the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias by 24-hour electrocardiographic recordings. Weight loss was rapid and sustained and averaged 10.1% +/- 0.8% over 40 days. Fasting plasma glucose levels declined from 16.2 +/- 1.9 mmol/L (293 +/- 36 mg/dL) to 6.9 +/- 0.8 mmol/L (126 +/- 16 mg/dL) by day 35. Similarly, hemoglobin A1c levels fell from 0.11 +/- 0.009 (11.2% +/- 0.9%) to 0.8 +/- 0.001 (8.2% +/- 1.1%). Urinary C-peptide levels declined from 62.2 +/- 15.6 nmol/48 h to 20.0 +/- 5.9 nmol/48 h by days 39 to 40 and paralleled the decline in plasma glucose values, the majority of which occurred in the first seven days. Concentrations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides decreased. Balances for nitrogen, potassium, and magnesium were negative at -1.7 g/24 h, -2.2 mEq/24 h, and -2.9 mg/dL, respectively. Blood pressure decreased without orthostasis. Resting metabolic rate fell a mean of 18% but remained within normal limits. Triiodothyronine levels also declined. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic readings disclosed no significant bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia for any patient. These studies, based on a limited number of subjects, demonstrate that a highly supplemented controlled low-energy diet is a safe and efficacious treatment for diabetes and obesity, leading to significant decreases in weight, blood pressure, and levels of plasma glucose and plasma lipids. Such diets may be the optimal initial treatment of moderate to markedly obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

To determine whether a simpler method of evaluating LVEFs was reliable, we compared the LVEFs derived by GBPS with those estimated in a cardiologist's examination in 125 hospitalized patients. Of the physician estimates, 56% were accurate to within 7.5%, while 17% were underestimates and 27% were overestimates. The variables that were most predictive of reduced LVEF included cardiomegaly and pulmonary venous congestion on chest roentgenogram and S3 gallop, hypotension, and sustained left ventricular apex beat on examination. Prior hypertension was correlated with an increased LVEF. Variables associated with physician error in estimating the LVEF included a history of hypertension, bronchodilator therapy, and right bundle-branch block seen on the electrocardiogram. These data suggest that although qualitatively accurate estimates of the LVEF can sometimes be made on the basis of clinical findings, GBPS should be performed when management decisions hinge on a precise knowledge of this value.\r"

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful lysis of a right atrial thrombus complicating a temporary transvenous pacemaker.\r"

  ".W": "Primary care practice requires clinical skills and knowledge that differ greatly from those required for successful completion of residency training. Discrepant clinical settings and physician responsibilities have thus created a mismatch between the educational content of residency training and the content of clinical practice, which may result in suboptimal preparation of internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians for patient care. Of equal concern, the psychosocial environment of residency does not prepare physicians for their future community and personal adult roles. Barriers to correcting this worsening mismatch include the following: (1) economic pressures to use house staff to meet service needs of hospitals, (2) changes in patient demographics and the focus of hospital-based medicine that are making hospitals progressively more unsuitable as the principal training site for primary care physicians, (3) the deemphasis of practicing physicians as role models and teachers in postgraduate training, and (4) the often heated disagreement among medical educators regarding the purpose and content of residency training. Efforts to resolve this mismatch should include the following: reexamining the educational objectives of the current system of postgraduate training, better counseling of physicians in training regarding career goals, and emphasizing the primary care physician as role models and faculty.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the mechanism of development of hypercalcemia in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), ten patients with a serum creatinine level less than 177 mumol/L (2 mg/dL) were examined. Although hypercalcemia was seen in only four (40%) of these patients, four of six normocalcemic patients showed hypercalciuria (greater than 5 mmol/d [greater than 200 mg/24 h]). All hypercalcemic patients exhibited high nephrogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate (NcAMP) levels in the face of low-normal immunoreactive parathyroid hormone and reduced serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] concentration. Half of the hypercalciuric patients with normocalcemia also showed high NcAMP and reduced serum 1,25(OH)2D levels. Furthermore, the changes in NcAMP and serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration closely paralleled the development of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in two patients. These results are reminiscent of the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy and suggest that derangements in calcium metabolism develop by a similar mechanism in patients with ATLL. The present data also indicate the importance of the measurement of urinary calcium excretion for early detection and prevention of fatal hypercalcemia in patients with ATLL.\r"

In the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium xenopi have caused widely disseminated infection. To determine the usefulness of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) in evaluating MOTT infection in AIDS, we reviewed MOTT cultures from 36 FBs, correlated these to clinical course, and identified MOTT isolates from cultures of all other sources in these patients. Of ten bronchoscopic MOTT isolates, seven were not related to lung disease or to dissemination within one month of FB. Of the four Mycobacterium fortuitum and seven M avium-intracellulare that did disseminate within one month, only two were reflected in bronchoscopic cultures. In patients with AIDS, bronchopulmonary MOTT colonization does occur. We recommend that standard criteria for pulmonary mycobacterial disease be applied. Negative bronchopulmonary cultures do not seem to exclude dissemination.\r"

The proteinuria and rheumatologic findings responded to prednisone therapy. The patient presented three months later with biliary tract obstruction secondary to pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver. The glomerulopathy and polymyalgia rheumatica in this case seemed to be components of the paraneoplastic syndrome. The response of both entities to prednisone therapy supports the hypothesis that they are caused by derangements in cell-mediated immunity. The fact that the tumor progressed despite resolution of the nephrosis and polymyalgia rheumatica suggests that cell-mediated immunity in general is altered by the tumor and not that the carcinoma liberates a factor that directly damages the kidney.\r"

A variety of nonbipolar psychotic disorders was found in the relatives of the patients. Comparing relatives of patients with schizophrenia with relatives of patients with schizoaffective disorder, there was no tendency for schizoaffective diagnosis or acute psychoses to aggregate separately from schizophrenia. Increased incidence of bipolar disorder was found in relatives of patients with schizoaffective disorder but not in relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Incidence of major affective disorder (bipolar and unipolar) was increased in relatives of probands with both types of psychoses. If we subdivide the ill probands according to whether or not they had a history of substance abuse, relatives of probands with substance abuse had greater frequency of affective disorder and substance abuse, but there were not significant differences in the number of relatives with nonbipolar psychoses.\r"

Both patients with BPD and controls with other personality disorders had similar rates and directions of comorbidity. The two groups did not differ significantly in prevalence of affective disorder. The DSM-III BPD appears to constitute a very heterogeneous category with unclear boundaries, overlapping with many different disorders but without a specific association with any one Axis I disorder. Comorbidity in patients with BPD may reflect base rates of psychopathology rather than anything inherent to BPD. Future studies should control for comorbidity to ensure homogeneity of comparison groups.\r"

While successful, ie, the quality of laboratory work in the United States has improved significantly during the past 40 years, this union of regulation and education continues to be a marriage of unequals. Clearly, those who started the professional laboratory community on the road to interlaboratory proficiency testing envisioned a promise of improved quality. The promise is fulfilled; even on an interlaboratory basis, the quality of work (precision) approaches or even exceeds the clinicians' requirements for medically useful data. Major problems continue to exist: the prospect of regulating a vast population of \"physicians' office laboratories\" presents new challenges for program providers, and as methodologies in laboratories have improved, some of the long-held systems of grading and performance evaluation are beginning to fail. The failure is not one of intent, logistics, or statistics. Proficiency testing, as a fine sharp tool, is corrupted when applied in a situation in which it is ill suited to perform. New knowledge will renew the promise and allow the professional, clinical laboratory community to progress.\r"

The evaluation process has consistently sought peer concensus, to stimulate improvement in state of the art, to increase medical usefulness, and to monitor the state of the art. Recent factors that are likely to promote change from peer group evaluation to fixed criteria evaluation are the high degree of proficiency in the state of the art for many analytes, accurate target values, increased knowledge of biologic variation, and the availability of statistical modeling techniques simulating biologic and diagnostic processes as well as analytic processes.\r"

A proficiency testing program should be a broad-based program covering the usual spectrum of laboratory disciplines without commercial bias and it should possess continuous scientific input so as to be capable of adjusting promptly to technologic advancements as well as maintaining established participant benefits. It is important that proficiency testing programs continue to develop mechanisms of mutual interchange with accreditational bodies and regulatory agencies.\r"

  ".W": "The National Bureau of Standards (NBS) has been involved for more than ten years in development of definitive methods for measuring important inorganic and organic analytes in human serum, including calcium, potassium, chloride, cholesterol, glucose, urea, uric acid, and creatinine. These methods are carefully designed and thoroughly tested isotope dilution mass spectrometric procedures that produce results of high precision and accuracy. Definitive methods are used to certify concentrations in reference serum pools, which are distributed among clinical laboratories as a means of assessing the accuracy of the routine methods. The College of American Pathologists operates a major proficiency testing program for clinical laboratories. The National Bureau of Standards works with the College of American Pathologists to assign values for analyte concentrations in proficiency testing samples where possible, and these values are used to assess the overall accuracy of the participants (grand mean) as well as the accuracy of peer groups (those that use the same methodology and/or instrumentation). For the analytes studied to date, the grand mean values have generally been close to the definitive values, but some of the peer group results have shown significant biases. To illustrate the definitive method development process, a modified and improved definitive method for cholesterol measurement is described. The modified method uses a cholesterol-13C3 as the labeled internal standard, capillary gas chromatography for sample introduction, and a novel means of electrically switching between the ions being measured. Results on standard reference material 909, a lyophilized human serum, demonstrate the precision and absence of significant measurement bias attainable with the new method.\r"

  ".W": "Historically, the quality of laboratory performance that must be provided to adequately support medical decision-making has been defined in three major ways: by the analytical variance of the state of the practice; by the total variance, including the expected analytical and biological variability; and by medical-usefulness criteria. Quality goals defined by these approaches have influenced instrument manufacturers, professional societies, governmental agencies, and even the precision and accuracy of medical practice. Despite past efforts, a consensus has not emerged on a scientifically and medically supportable set of laboratory performance requirements. Medically relevant goals for analytic performance would help avoid costly and unnecessary regulatory requirements and permit steady improvement in instrumentation and methods.\r"

  ".W": "The two-decade history of federal clinical laboratory standards is associated with improved laboratory performance. At present, there is limited empirical evidence explaining which regulatory requirements have contributed to this improvement. Some evidence suggests a cause-and-effect relationship for certain standards, eg, participation in proficiency testing, but not for others. Further improvements in performance and evolutionary changes in standards can be anticipated. The federal rule-making process properly emphasizes fairness and participation. As a result, the standard-setting process may not keep pace with rapid technological and utilization changes now in progress. A shared goal of laboratorians and policy makers is to \"do no harm!\" Empirical evidence is likely to play an ever increasing role in meeting this goal, which will require identifying effective and cost-efficient standards for laboratory performance.\r"

This is a report of the results of a user's investigation of the proficiency testing flags encountered in our laboratory from three survey programs over a two-year period. The survey programs were administered by the College of American Pathologists, the Centers for Disease Control, and the State of New York. The explanations for the abnormal survey results were classified into six categories: possible analytic measurement problem (28%), clerical error in transcription or completion of forms (16%), inappropriate survey criteria (17%), specimen problem (11%), agency amended report (5%), and no identifiable cause (23%).\r"

  ".W": "A questionnaire concerned with special practices associated with proficiency testing was sent to the Chemistry Supervisor, Hematology Supervisor, and Chief Pathologist of 190 Pennsylvania hospital laboratories. Responses were received from 156 hospitals (82.1%) and included responses from 131 chemistry supervisors, 108 hematology supervisors, and 92 chief pathologists. The vast majority of respondents (85% to 95%) indicated moderate to great pressure to score acceptably. The survey showed a high prevalence of special practices, including analysis of controls just prior to survey specimens (23% to 42%), analysis in duplicate on a single instrument (52% to 88%), analysis on more than one instrument (17% to 31%), analysis on two or more separate days (20% to 39%), and delay of testing until an instrument is \"working better\" (24% to 34%). Approximately 63% of chemistry results and 72% of hematology results are reported as averages or medians. Pathologists consistently reported a lower prevalence of special practices than did laboratory supervisors. These high prevalences of special practices associated with proficiency testing specimens have important implications for proficiency testing programs.\r"

Clinical uses of test results are enumerated. Good clinical skills are necessary for optimal test efficiency. Clinicians should improve their selection of tests, pay attention to proper patient preparation, and refine the process of interpretation of test results using disease-based reference ranges and more formal analysis of predictive value. By better definition of the clinical uses of laboratory tests, appropriate attention can be directed to steps in the laboratory domain such as medically relevant goals for accuracy and precision. With clearer understanding of the testing process, proficiency testing for monitoring laboratory performance can be more fully utilized. Audit models should be developed that include assessment of the outcome of the laboratory testing process.\r"

Accuracy refers to the quality of the information provided by the classification device and should be distinguished from the efficacy, or practical usefulness, of the information. Receiver operating characteristic curves provide a pure index of accuracy by demonstrating the limits of a test's ability to discriminate between alternative states of health over the complete spectrum of operating conditions. If analytical imprecision is removed from the data, the resulting receiver operating characteristic curve represents the inherent biological variation that ultimately limits the clinical accuracy of the test.\r"
