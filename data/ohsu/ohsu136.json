  ".W": "The possibility that the prostanoid system contributes to the capability of the newborn piglet to maintain cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate during hypotension was investigated. The effect of hemorrhage on net (arterial-to-venous) cerebral prostacyclin production and the effects of indomethacin on cerebral hemodynamic response to hemorrhage and on the cerebral oxygen utilization following hemorrhage were determined in chronically instrumented, unanesthetized newborn pigs. Hemorrhage decreased arterial pressure about 35% but did not affect cerebral blood flow or cerebral O2 consumption. Hemorrhage was accompanied by an increase in net cerebral 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production from 4.0 +/- 1.1 to 15.3 +/- 4.9 ng/100g X min (mean +/- SEM). Indomethacin treatment of piglets following hemorrhage inhibited the net cerebral production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and caused a decrease in blood flow (approximately equal to 40%) to all brain regions within 20 minutes. The decrease in cerebral blood flow was the result of an increase in cerebral vascular resistance of 57 and 180%, 20 and 40 minutes post treatment, respectively. Cerebral O2 consumption was reduced from 2.5 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g X min to 1.5 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g X min 20 minutes following treatment of hemorrhaged piglets with indomethacin and to 1.1 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g X min 40 minutes after treatment. Six of 8 piglets for whom the data were recorded that were administered indomethacin following hemorrhage became comatose with cerebral O2 consumption of 0.4 +/- 0.1 ml O2/100 g X min by 40 minutes after treatment. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the prostanoid system contributes to the maintenance of cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate during hypotension in the newborn.\r"

  ".U": "87103482\r", 
  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that thromboxane A2 and thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor occupation are important in mediating cyclical reductions in coronary blood flow (CFVs) in concentrically narrowed canine coronary arteries. Two potent and selective thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonists, SQ29,548 and SQ28,668 eliminated CFVs and restored a normal pattern of blood flow through the severely narrowed vessels in 77 and 75% of the dogs, respectively. CFVs were eliminated within several minutes of an intravenous bolus injection of SQ29,548 or SQ28,688. A continuous infusion of SQ29,548 (0.2 mg/kg X min) prevented the recurrence of CFVs throughout the duration of its infusion. Left atrial infusion of the thromboxane A2 mimetic, U46619, restored CFVs in 5 of 8 SQ29,548-treated and in 5 of 7 SQ28,668-treated dogs. Circulating concentrations of the stable metabolites of TxA2 and PGI2, TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, respectively, were unaffected by administration of SQ29,548. However, stenosed vascular segments of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of SQ29,548-treated dogs produced significantly less thromboxane A2 than comparable segments from untreated dogs. Morphologic studies showed that stenosed coronary arteries in which CFVs had been abolished by either SQ29,548 or SQ28,668 had relatively few adherent platelets, whereas comparable coronary segments removed from untreated animals had relatively large, platelet-rich mural thrombi. SQ29,548 did not alter the synthesis of TxB2 by platelets. 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentrations in the stenosed LAD and nonstenosed circumflex coronary arteries were not altered by SQ29,548 administration. These data suggest that the thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonists, SQ29,548 and SQ28,688, inhibit cyclic reductions in coronary blood flow in this model by preventing the accumulation of platelets at the site of a critical coronary arterial stenosis. The data also suggest that TxA2 is important in mediating the interaction between platelets and the constricted coronary artery that is responsible for the development and maintenance of CFVs in this experimental model.\r"

Time-averaged integrated backscatter (IB) and cardiac cycle-dependent amplitude modulation were measured from subepicardial, midmyocardial, and subendocardial regions of the left ventricular apex and the midportion of the right ventricular free wall under normal conditions (n = 5), after 1 hr of 100% acute left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion (n = 8), and after 15 min LAD occlusion plus 120 min reperfusion (n = 5) in anesthetized, ventilated open-chest dogs. A significant increase in time-averaged IB was observed in the subepicardium, the midmyocardium, and the subendocardium during ischemia and reperfusion, but there was no intramyocardial variability. Cardiac cycle-dependent amplitude modulation of IB was significantly higher in the normal subendocardium than in the subepicardium (4.3 +/- 0.6 vs 2.9 +/- 0.8 dB, p less than .01) and midmyocardium (2.8 +/- .05 dB, p less than .01). This transmural gradient in amplitude modulation was abolished during ischemia and reperfusion. We conclude that cardiac cycle-dependent amplitude modulation in IB has a transmural dependence in the normal myocardium and this is abolished during acute myocardial ischemia.\r"

Neuraminidase may react with immunoglobulins in the circulation and with sialic acid-rich sites in the endothelial and epithelial glomerular capillary, therefore, extrinsic or intrinsic sialic acid-depleted substrate may be localized in the glomeruli. We studied renal biopsies from 17 patients with APSGN, 48 patients with other renal pathologies and 2 normal kidneys for the capacity to bind fluorescein-labelled peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin. PNA has specificity for galactosyl radicals which are exposed after sialic acid removal. We similarly studied the kidneys of rats at intervals ranging from hours to 32 days after an intravenous injection of 0.02 units of neuraminidase per g of body weight. Five biopsies of APSGN patients and 2 biopsies from patients with renal pathologies different from APSGN showed glomerular PNA binding. Of APSGN patients, 4 corresponded to the 5 patients biopsied within 30 days of the beginning of the disease and only 1 biopsy was positive in the 12 patients who were biopsied later. The PNA binding predominated in the mesangium and the pattern was irregular and speckled. These findings suggest that sialic-acid depleted material is present in the glomeruli, early in the course of APSGN.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the pathogenesis of glomerular injury in renal allografts, we have analyzed intraglomerular mononuclear cells from 20 biopsies with typical features of transplant glomerular rejection (TGR) (segmental or global occlusion of capillaries by swollen cells). Ten biopsies showing cellular rejection but no glomerular pathology were selected as controls. Microwave fixation and an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique were used with the following monoclonal antibodies; Leu1 and OKT3 (pan T cell), Leu 3 a + b and OKT4 (helper T cell), OKT8 (cytotoxic T cell), OKB7 (B cell), OKM1 (monocyte) and OKDR (DR positive cell). The results showed a significant increase of T cells, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and monocytes in the patients with TGR compared with the controls (all p less than 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). Of the T cell subsets, cytotoxic T cells outnumbered helper T cells by a mean ratio of 3.2:1. In the interstitium, the distribution of mononuclear cells was not different between the two patient groups. In both, T cells and monocytes were predominant and few B cells were found. The percentage of cytotoxic T cells was similar to that of helper T cells. In this study, there were at least four TGR patients without cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and the distribution of intraglomerular mononuclear cells in these patients was indistinguishable from that of other TGR patients. There was no significant association of the distribution of mononuclear cells with the severity of glomerular damage. These results suggest that T cells, predominantly of the cytotoxic subset and monocytes are involved in the mediation of TGR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients with end-stage renal failure treated by hemodialysis or transplantation were followed for up to 10 years. Sequential full thickness iliac crest bone biopsies were obtained to assess the effects on bone disease of hemodialysis, treatment with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] and 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [24,25-(OH)2D3] and renal transplantation. The biopsies were analyzed by a computerized histomorphometric technique which allowed accurate measurements of calcified bone and osteoid areas. Serum aluminum and parathyroid hormone concentrations were also monitored. Hemodialysis was associated with a loss of calcified bone and an increase in osteoid areas. The progressive bone loss was arrested but not reversed following treatment with either 1,25-(OH)2D3 or 24,25-(OH)2D3. Osteoid area was unchanged or reduced following treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 in all but three patients who had serum aluminum concentrations in excess of 5 mumol/l. 24,25-(OH)2D3 was not effective in reducing osteoid area, and combined treatment with 1,25 and 24,25-(OH)2D3 had no effect beyond that expected with 1,25-(OH)2D3 alone. Bone biopsies showed loss of calcified bone and an increase in osteoid areas one year and more after successful renal transplantation in five patients. Nineteen of the 23 patients developed serum aluminum concentrations greater than 3 mumol/l, probably because of the use of oral aluminum hydroxide as a phosphate binding agent. In these patients serum parathyroid hormone concentrations greater than 600 pg/ml appeared to prevent the development of osteopenia.\r"

A well-reconstructed thumb should be in proper position with good stability, have good sensation, be of proper length, and have a satisfactory aesthetic appearance. Proper selection of patients, based on the level of thumb loss, condition of other fingers, and age, occupation, and activities of the patient, is a key to successful reconstruction of the thumb. Care must be taken to avoid excessive interference with the original function of the donor site.\r"

Its use as an extradural spinal and nerve root membrane to reduce postoperative adhesions after laminectomy was tested in 22 rabbits with laminectomy in the second and fourth lumbar vertebra. The sites were reviewed histologically two to 36 weeks after operation. Histologic sections showed that Zenoderm was initially surrounded by hematoma that organized into fibrous tissue and, later, bone. When Zenoderm was placed immediately adjacent to the dura, dense adhesions formed, which were slower to resolve than those in the control sites. The rate of Zenoderm resorption was variable. In general, Zenoderm did not excite excessive fibrous tissue formation and was slowly replaced by bone. Contrary to the experience of others, it was unusual to find adhesions between the laminectomy site, and the dura began disappearing after six to nine weeks. In rabbits, Zenoderm is unlikely to prevent adhesions forming after lumbar disc surgery. The resorption rate is variable, and laminectomy sites are unsuitable for the investigation of material for the prevention of spinal dural adhesions.\r"

The operative and postoperative mortality was 11%, wound infection 11%, delayed wound healing 11%, and the immediate success rate 89%. A follow-up study of 33 cases for more than two years showed that 25 patients were living and well, providing a survival rate of 75.7%. Except for malignant tumors, preservation of upper sacral nerve roots was possible and necessary in the majority of low grade and benign tumors. Ligation of both internal iliac arteries and a temporary block of the common iliac arteries or aorta minimized bleeding. Injury to veins must be carefully avoided. Postoperative X-ray treatment appeared helpful in reducing recurrences, especially in upper sacral tumors where nerve root compression had to be relieved.\r"

Administrative problems arise if the recipient's suitability is too narrowly evaluated. Assessment may be time-limited. The intensive care unit environment and the VIP characteristics of child transplantation patients may distort observations and constrain opportunities for preventive preoperative psychologic management. Unnecessary psychiatric complications may ensue, which imperil the transplantation surgery. The primary caretakers may have an extraordinary emotional investment, so liaison is pressured. Three cases are presented to illustrate these points. Medical ethical perspectives and the limitations of medical training to prepare physicians to perceive them are indicated. That these limitations also affect the psychiatrist is acknowledged, and a clinical research approach is suggested.\r"

However, hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients in clinical situations where circulating catecholamines are raised including myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia stress tests. The effects of L-adrenaline infusions, sufficient to achieve pathophysiological levels of adrenaline, and of therapeutic intravenous infusions of salbutamol, a beta 2-agonist, on plasma magnesium, plasma potassium, plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels were studied in a placebo-controlled design in eight normal subjects. Plasma magnesium levels fell significantly during the adrenaline infusion and also during the salbutamol infusion, though more slowly. In a 1 h period of observation after cessation of the infusions no recovery of plasma magnesium levels was seen. Significant falls in plasma potassium levels were also observed during both infusions with spontaneous recovery within 30 min after the infusions. No significant changes in plasma insulin levels occurred with either salbutamol or L-adrenaline compared with control. Plasma glucose levels rose significantly during the adrenaline infusion. The study suggests that both L-adrenaline and salbutamol cause shifts in plasma magnesium which are not mediated by insulin. We propose that intracellular shifts of magnesium occur as a result of beta-adrenergic stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "PEEP improves the gas-exchange abnormalities that accompany adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, since PEEP decreases cardiac output, it may also alter regional blood flow and therefore, substrate delivery to specific organs. To test this hypothesis, radiolabeled 15-mu microspheres were used to directly quantify the effects of mechanical ventilation with PEEP on regional blood flow to individual organs in animals. Mechanical ventilation alone produced a -21.2 +/- 3.6% and a -28.1 +/- 5.2% decrease in cardiac output at 30 and 60 min, respectively. The addition of 14 cm H2O PEEP resulted in little further reduction in cardiac output at 30 and 60 min (-28 +/- 2.3% and -36.4 +/- 4.9%, respectively). However, 25 cm H2O PEEP reduced markedly (p less than .01) cardiac output (-59.2 +/- 6.1% at 30 min and -55.1 +/- 4.0% at 60 min). Although blood flows to the kidney and brain were maintained, decreases in cardiac output were invariably accompanied by proportional decreases in blood flow to the heart. Intravascular volume expansion with saline (20 ml/kg) during 14 cm H2O PEEP significantly improved cardiac output (3.23 +/- 0.34 to 4.22 +/- 0.13 L/min; p less than .01) and proportionately increased blood flow to several regional vascular beds, including the heart. These data suggest that PEEP decreases cardiac output to produce reversible alterations in blood flow to a number of regional vascular beds. These PEEP-induced alterations in regional blood flow may have important implications for the development of multiple-organ failure in ARDS patients.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven patients suffering severe traumatic respiratory insufficiency were mechanically ventilated using a new system which combined high-frequency positive-pressure ventilation (HFPPV) with low-rate conventional mechanical ventilation (LRCMV). Ten similar patients were ventilated by conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) with PEEP. HFPPV patients were fully conscious and cooperative during ventilation and did not need sedatives or muscle relaxants. Arterial oxygenation was significantly (p less than .005) better in HFPPV than CMV patients (89.91 +/- 10.24 vs. 78.43 +/- 11.13 torr, respectively), and pulmonary shunt was also better in the HFPPV group (13.1 +/- 4.7% vs. 20.4 +/- 6.4%, p less than .01). Moreover, inspired oxygen concentrations were lower (PaO2/FIO2 197.8 +/- 51.3 in the HFPPV group vs. 130 +/- 46.6 in the CMV group, p less than .005) and the time required for mechanical ventilation was shorter (4.2 +/- 0.91 vs. 6.1 +/- 0.8 days, p less than .1). All HFPPV patients immediately began breathing spontaneously when they were disconnected from the ventilator. We suggest this method as a better ventilatory mode for patients suffering traumatic respiratory insufficiency.\r"

Differentiation between hilar adenopathy and prominent pulmonary vessels is also sometimes difficult. We studied 16 young adults with CF using both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CXR to evaluate the usefulness of MRI in this clinical context. The same patients were studied with abdominal ultrasound and MRI for evaluation of the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, and spleen. The MRI was superior to CXR in detecting hilar and mediastinal adenopathy and in differentiating nodes from prominent vessels. It was useful in the evaluation of bronchiectasis. The CXR was superior for assessing infiltrates, hyperinflation, sternal bowing, volume loss, and hilar retraction. The MRI was only slightly better than sonography in depicting fatty infiltration of the pancreas. The modalities were equally effective in detecting hepatosplenomegaly and signs of portal hypertension. Gallbladder evaluation was far superior with sonography.\r"

Ventilatory support during IMV and CMV was adjusted by changing the ventilator rate while tidal volume was maintained at 12 ml/kg. HFV was produced at a frequency of 100 cycles/min and an I/E ratio of 1:2. End-expiratory airway pressure and inspired oxygen concentration were maintained constant. The three ventilatory modes produced similar mean airway, transpulmonary, and intra-thoracic pressures. Mechanical control of respiration required hyperventilation during both CMV and HFV. Arterial blood oxygenation, heart rate, vascular pressures, cardiac output, and myocardial ischemia were unaffected by the changes in ventilation. Decreased arteriovenous oxygen content difference (p less than 0.05) and increased mixed venous oxygen content (p less than 0.05) suggested improved systemic blood flow during IMV. Controlled ventilation by conventional means or with a high frequency technique had no detectable advantage over partial ventilatory support with IMV during cardiopulmonary failure stabilized with vasoactive therapy and continuous positive airway pressure.\r"

Therefore, a retrospective review in ten Yale-affiliated hospitals was undertaken to establish the outcome of surgical resection for rectal cancer in this patient population. Of those 373 patients who had had curative resections, 192 (52 percent) were abdominoperineal resections (APR); 105 patients (28 percent) had restorative resections with sutured anastomoses, and the EEA stapler was used in 76 patients (20 percent). There was an equal distribution of tumors in the various Dukes' stages in all three procedures. Local tumor recurrence was: APR 19 percent, SUT 17 percent, and EEA 24 percent, but local tumor recurrence was more frequent after EEA than APR for tumors 7 to 10 cm from the anal verge (32 vs. 13 percent, respectively, P less than 0.05), and the time to recurrence was least in EEA patients. It is concluded that local tumor recurrence is higher than expected for all three procedures and that the EEA stapler was associated with a greater risk of local tumor recurrence. These findings are attributed to surgeon-related technical operative factors rather than to the nature of the tumors themselves.\r"

At endoscopy, striking erythema and inflammatory changes of the gastric mucosa may be seen. The nonsurgical treatment for this syndrome is unsatisfactory. Because of the potential pathogenetic role of regurgitating bile acids, lysolecithin, and pancreatic secretions, it seemed relevant to find out whether prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose of 0.5 mg qid could protect the gastric mucosa from further damage and thereby lead to symptomatic improvement. The results of this controlled doubled-blind crossover trial, comparing PGE2 and placebo, in the treatment of postgastrectomy reflux gastritis reveal no significant differences between PGE2 and placebo with regard to symptoms, endoscopic features, and histologic evidence of inflammatory changes. Thus, prostaglandin E2 in the dose used appears incapable of improving postgastrectomy reflux gastritis in patients with mild to moderate degrees of this entity.\r"

Control small intestinal epithelium and inflammatory bowel disease epithelium expressed 12 antigen, while control colonic epithelium did not. I2 expression by enterocytes was more frequent on the lateral and basal surface than on the microvillus surface. Two of three M cells in control ileum expressed I2 antigen. I2-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes were rarely detected in both control and disease specimens. I2-positive lamina propria lymphocytes were significantly increased in inflammatory bowel disease, while I2-positive lamina propria lymphocytes were virtually absent in control specimens. I2-positive mononuclear cells in the intestinal lamina propria were largely macrophages and monocytes in both control and inflammatory bowel disease specimens. I2-positive mononuclear cells resembling dendritic cells were not detected in control or disease specimens. Furthermore, there were no significant morphological differences in I2-positive or -negative macrophages and monocytes in control and disease specimens. The expression of I2 antigen on Schwann cells was detected more frequently in disease specimens than in control specimens. Capillary endothelia of both control and disease specimens expressed I2 antigen. We demonstrate that I2 expression is present on surface membranes of both immune and nonimmune cells of the intestine and colon and show that this expression is more prominent in inflammatory bowel disease than in control intestine and colon. Further studies are required to determine whether this finding is meaningful in terms of antigen presentation and whether this apparent \"immune activation\" is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

VIP-, SP-, enkephalin-, and NPY-immunoreactive nerve fibers were observed in the LES of both species, whereas nerve fibers containing gastrin/CCK, neurotensin, and somatostatin could not be demonstrated. The peptide-containing nerve fibers occurred in the intramural ganglia and in the smooth muscle layers. There was a rich supply of VIP- and NPY-immunoreactive fibers, whereas the supply of SP- and enkephalin-immunoreactive nerve fibers were moderate in number in both species examined. The concentration of VIP, SP, enkephalin, and NPY was comparable in the two species. The present study shows that the pattern of peptidergic innervation of the LES is similar in pig and man. It is proposed that neuronal VIP, SP, enkephalin, and NPY may serve to modulate the motor activity of the LES and that the pig is a suitable experimental animal for the study of regulatory peptides and LES functions.\r"

In contrast, the numbers of IgM plasma cells were increased in the AIDS and homosexual control groups compared to the heterosexuals. Plasma cell fluorescence intensities for IgA and IgM were decreased in the AIDS patients, implying less cytoplasmic immunoglobulin per cell. The frequency of IgA plasma cell depletion did not differ in men and women, patients with opportunistic infections or Kaposi's sarcoma, or in patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms. The extent of IgA plasma cell depletion did not correlate with serum IgA concentrations. IgA plasma cell numbers also did not correlate with selected parameters of nutritional status and intestinal absorption. Studies of salivary IgA output demonstrated decreased secretion of soluble IgA in AIDS patients, and an increased secretion of IgA in particulate form. These results suggest that abnormalities in IgA secretion occur in AIDS and might influence its clinical manifestations.\r"

All the doses of acarbose tested slowed the postprandial plasma glucose rise, without evidence of dose dependency, while maximal inhibition of integrated insulin and gastric inhibitory polypeptide responses to 31 +/- 8% and 28 +/- 7% of control values, respectively, was obtained at the 400-mg dose. The enteroglucagon response was increased to a maximum of 905 +/- 262% of control at the 200-mg dose, and total motilin responses were slightly but not significantly elevated. After one week of regular acarbose administration at 100 mg three times daily, the effects of the 100-mg dose on insulin and enteroglucagon responses were slightly enhanced, and there was no evidence of intestinal adaptation in the form of diminished postprandial endocrine responses. The observed effects are attributed to impairment of carbohydrate digestion in the upper small intestine and suggest that the optimal ratio of desired to unwanted effects is obtained at low doses of acarbose.\r"

The tumors, histologically adenocarcinomas, were located in the common bile duct in five patients and in the hepatic duct in one. The mean survival was 11.8 months (one patient is still alive with recurrent carcinoma). Pericholangitis and sclerosing cholangitis is a frequent preexisting lesion in patients with bile duct carcinoma complicating ulcerative colitis and may be considered a premalignant lesion in these patients.

During the first 5 h of infusion, the depot size was almost constant (approximately 5 IU) with an absorption rate that equaled the infusion rate. Doubling the infusion rate led to a significant increase in depot size, but the absorption rate remained unchanged for the first 3 h, and only thereafter was a significant increase seen. When the infusion rate was reduced to the initial 1.12 IU/h, the absorption rate remained elevated during the next 3 h. Correspondingly, when the infusion rate was decreased, the depot size also decreased, but the absorption rate remained unchanged for the first 3 h. The results show that a change in the basal insulin infusion rate does not lead to any immediate change in the insulin absorption rate. This should be considered when planning an insulin-infusion program that includes alteration(s) in the basal-rate setting.\r"

  ".W": "Discontinuing wear of the insulin pump for short periods enhances the feasibility of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. Because insulin requirements differ during pump and injection therapy, we studied the optimal substitution dose and injection site in seven type I diabetic patients to compensate for the overnight (2100-0730 h) interruption of CSII. The missed basal continuous infusion dose was replaced by injecting intermediate-acting insulin subcutaneously in three different ways: 1.5 times the dose in the abdomen, twice the dose in the abdomen, and twice the dose in the buttock. During CSII, glycemia remained unchanged throughout the night. Both 1.5 times and twice the replacement doses injected in the abdomen resulted in an initial decline in blood glucose with hypoglycemia in two patients followed by a rebound rise. When the replacement dose of 1.5 times was used, blood glucose rose by 4.9 +/- 1.2 mM overnight (P less than .02). These changes after abdominal injection were associated with a rapid early absorption of injected insulin with hypoinsulinemia in the morning. With twice the replacement dose injected in the buttock, insulin absorption was slower, fluctuations in nocturnal glycemia were minor, and the blood glucose level at 0730 h was similar to that of the previous night. There was a significant inverse correlation between blood glucose and serum free-insulin levels in the early morning (r = - .60, P less than .01). In conclusion, a substitution dose of 1.5 times to twice the missed basal infusion rate injected in the buttock compensates for the overnight interruption of CSII without risk of major fluctuations in blood glucose levels or nocturnal hypoglycemia.\r"

On one of the days, standardized massage of both injection sites was performed for 30 min starting 30 min after insulin injection. Serum insulin and plasma glucose were determined intermittently before, during, and after massage, and elimination of radioactivities was monitored continuously by external detectors. During massage, the first-order elimination rate constants of 125I increased approximately sixfold compared with the rise during control (0.19 +/- 0.04 to 0.88 +/- 0.15%/min during the last 15 min of the massage vs. 0.21 +/- 0.03 to 0.32 +/- 0.03%/min during control). Serum insulin increased from 13.8 +/- 1.8 mU/L before massage to a maximal value of 56.4 +/- 8.7 mU/L 10 min after massage (vs. 15.3 +/- 3.0 and 19.7 +/- 2.2 mU/L during control). Plasma glucose fell significantly faster on the massage day, from 10 min after massage onward. No significant alteration in the subcutaneous blood flow was found during or after massage. The results suggest that the pronounced enhancement of insulin absorption induced by massage of the injection site is mainly not blood flow mediated.\r"

Concentrations of plasma free insulin were compared with those obtained from seven other nondiabetic subjects after repeated injections of equal amounts of insulin intramuscularly and subcutaneously. Intraperitoneal insulin above the transverse mesocolon yielded a faster rise of free insulin, peaking at 15 min, whereas intraperitoneal insulin below the transverse mesocolon produced a somewhat slower rise, peaking at 30 min. The area under the curves between 0 and 15 min was greater after the injection above than below the transverse mesocolon (P less than .05). Intramuscular and subcutaneous insulin injections resulted in a slower rise of plasma free insulin, peaking at 60 and 90 min, respectively. We conclude that the pattern of insulin appearance in the plasma resembles more closely physiologic events after intraperitoneal than after subcutaneous or intramuscular insulin administration.\r"

Mixtures of porcine regular and lente insulins resulted in a reduction in activity of the mixture compared with separate injection that was more apparent with premixing for 5 min before injecting than with premixing for 2 min. These findings were not explained by differences in volume of the injected insulin preparations. Mixing of porcine regular and bovine ultralente insulins for 2 min before injecting resulted in a reduced activity compared with separate injection. No difference in activity was obvious for porcine regular and NPH insulins given separately or premixed for 5 min. A reduction of activity during the 1st h after injection was observed when separate injection of one brand of these insulins (Velosulin or Insulatard) was compared with the manufactured mixture (Mixtard). These results indicate that premixing regular and NPH insulins in a 1-to-2 ratio does not alter the biological activity compared with separate administration of the insulins. However, the mixing of regular and insulin-zinc suspensions results in a loss of insulin activity, the magnitude of which depends on the time between mixing and injecting the insulin. The clinical significance of the effect of mixing on the efficacy of subcutaneous insulin therapy should be considered in the context that this is only one of many factors that may affect the activity of subcutaneously injected insulin.\r"

Free-insulin curves and the biologic effect of insulin, assessed by the glucose-clamp technique, were compared. The absorption rate of regular insulin was higher when injected separately from the intermediate-acting preparation: the incremental areas of free insulin above basal levels, up to 90 min after the administration of the hormone, were 32 +/- 5 vs. 21 +/- 3 microU X ml-1 X min-1 (P less than .02). In the same period, glucose infused to sustain glycemia showed no significant differences (2.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.3 mg X kg-1 X min-1 after the administration of insulin in separate and combined injection, respectively). The difference in insulin profiles is not translated into a significant difference in glucose requirement. This might be a consequence of a flattening of the insulin dose-response curve due to insulin resistance of diabetic subjects. The slight delay in insulin action of Actrapid when mixed with Monotard is probably irrelevant in clinical practice.\r"

To determine whether testing for urinary ketones is clinically useful in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), a retrospective review was undertaken of 152 charts of patients admitted to the hospital during a 6-mo period with the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Of the 135 patients with NIDDM, 96% had routine testing performed for urinary ketones. Surprisingly, 26% of the patients with NIDDM had positive urine ketones at some time during hospitalization, and the degree of ketonuria was markedly greater did not reflect diabetic ketoacidosis. Ketonuria was accompanied by significant hyperglycemia and most likely reflects relative insulinopenia. Only 23% of the episodes of ketonuria were acknowledged in the progress notes. Although NIDDM patients who had ketonuria in the hospital were more likely to be transiently treated with insulin than patients without ketonuria, in no instance did the progress notes state that a diagnostic test or change in therapy was ordered because of the presence of a positive test for urinary ketones. The primary goal for therapy of patients with NIDDM should remain good control of blood glucose. In the hospitalized patient in whom frequent blood glucose determinations are made, it is not clear that urinary ketone testing needs to be routinely done.\r"

A sequential three-step hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed in six insulin-dependent diabetics before and after 2 wk of hydroflumethiazide (HFT) administration in a daily dose of 75 mg. Insulin was infused at rates of 0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 mU X kg-1 X min-1, and each dose was given for at least 120 min. Glucose uptake during the last 30 min of each step was almost identical in the two situations (2.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.5 mg X kg-1 X min-1, 9.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.7 +/- 1.2 mg X kg-1 X min-1, and 12.0 +/- 1.3 vs. 12.6 +/- 1.5 mg X kg-1 X min-1). Serum insulin levels were also similar, and blood glucose was kept at 100 +/- 3, 99 +/- 4, and 97 +/- 3 mg/dl before thiazides and at 93 +/- 6, 93 +/- 6, and 94 +/- 6 mg/dl after thiazides. Another five insulin-dependent diabetics were infused with tritiated glucose followed by insulin infusion at two rates: 0.45 and 1.0 mU X kg-1 X min-1. Basal glucose output was comparable before and after thiazides (3.63 +/- 0.24 vs. 2.97 +/- 0.26 mg X kg-1 X min-1), as was the liver response to increasing insulin concentrations. The metabolic state as assessed by HbA1c and fasting blood glucose did not differ in the two experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven days later, the same amount and type of NPH insulin was given in the same anatomic site with a Medi-Jector II, which delivers insulin as a jet stream. Blood was collected before insulin injection and at hourly intervals subsequently for the measurement of glucose and insulin. The total serum insulin measured before the first morning dose with the needle and syringe and the Medi-Jector II was 41.2 +/- 10.7 microU/ml and 46.2 +/- 10.7 microU/ml, respectively. During the next 9 h, the areas under the respective total insulin curves were not different, but the area under the free-insulin curve after jet injection was greater than the free-insulin area after needle injection (P less than .01). The ratio of free/total serum insulin was 0.31 +/- 0.02 after needle injection and 0.40 +/- 0.03 after jet injection (P less than .0025). The peak of total insulin concentration occurred 4.2 h after jet injection of NPH: 1 h earlier than the peak after needle injection. The plasma glucose at time zero was 197 +/- 15 mg/dl before needle injection and 242 +/- 19 mg/dl before jet injection. Although the diet consumed by each subject on the 2nd study day was identical to that of the 1st day, the mean glucose increase was greater after needle-injected insulin than after jet-spray injection. This indicates that the greater amount of free insulin observed after jet-injected insulin had a direct effect in lowering the plasma glucose. Jet injection may reduce insulin requirements by increasing the availability of free insulin.\r"

  ".U": "87105274\r", 
  ".W": "A reverse hemolytic plaque assay (RHPA) for ACTH was developed to study the responses of anterior lobe corticotropes to secretagogues-CRF, arginine vasopressin (AVP), angiotensin II (A-II), or to a 6- to 24-h pretreatment with corticosterone. Tests showed that optimal plaque formation was obtained after 3-4 h with 1:100-1:200 anti ACTH-(25-39) and 1:20-1:50 complement. Under optimal basal conditions, 6.6% of pituitary cells from normal male rats formed plaques. The addition of 50-90 micrograms/ml ACTH to the anti-ACTH for 48 h before its use in the RHPA resulted in a decrease in percentage of ACTH plaques to levels not different from those obtained with preimmune serum, or when complement was omitted from the assay (0.9-1.3%). There was a gradual increase in percentage of ACTH plaques to 9.8% of the population after exposure to increasing doses of CRF (0.1-10 nM). These same high percentages of ACTH plaques could also be obtained by the addition of 1 nM AVP or A-II with the lowest doses of CRF (100-500 pM). Exposure to 1 nM AVP alone resulted in no significant increases in percentages above basal values. Average plaque areas were increased to maximal levels of three to four X basal with increasing doses of CRF. Finally, when cells were pretreated with 100 nM corticosterone for up to 24 h, the percentage of plaques formed under basal conditions was reduced by 60% (2.6%) and it did not increase after exposure to 1 nM CRF. The data from the RHPA correlate well with previous studies of corticotropes. Since ACTH cells normally represent 10% of the anterior lobe cell population, the RHPA shows that a subset of corticotropes (6.6%) is actively secreting under basal conditions tested in this study. The remaining 3% can be stimulated to form plaques by high doses of CRF (greater than 1 nM) or low doses of CRF (100 pM) and 1 nM AVP or A-II. Glucocorticoids reduce the percentage of ACTH plaques formed under basal or stimulated conditions and allow no CRF-stimulated increase in plaque area. This correlates with recent reports that show glucocorticoids inhibit proopiomelanocortin messenger RNA synthesis and lower the number of pituitary CRF receptors.\r"

  ".W": "After internalization by isolated rat adipocytes, insulin can be degraded or released intact from the cell, a process termed retroendocytosis. To determine whether the amount of ligand entering the cell could modulate its ultimate intracellular disposition, adipocytes were incubated with 0.4-25 ng/ml radiolabeled insulin for 20 min at 37 C to reach steady state binding and internalization. After this, surface bound insulin was removed by acid extraction and the cells were reincubated in insulin-free 37 C buffer. The fractional rate of release of internalized cell associated radioactivity was similar at all insulin concentrations. However, insulin enhanced the appearance of trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable material in a dose-dependent manner reaching a maximum at an insulin concentration of 10 ng/ml. At 0.4 ng/ml insulin, 18 +/- 2% of the released radioactivity was TCA precipitable whereas 36 +/- 3% was precipitable at 25 ng/ml. Sephadex G-50 gel chromatography and reverse phase HPLC analysis of the reincubation medium confirmed TCA-precipitable material was intact insulin. To further investigate the dual pathways of intracellular insulin processing, adipocytes were incubated with 0.4 and 25 ng/ml insulin for 20 min, acid extracted to remove surface receptor insulin, and solubilized. Sephadex G-50 and HPLC analysis revealed that proportionately less insulin intermediates and low molecular weight degradation products are found in cells incubated at the higher insulin concentrations. In conclusion, as adipocytes internalize more insulin, less is converted into insulin intermediates and low molecular weight degradation products and more is diverted to retroendocytosis.\r"

By employing several different column chromatography methods (gel filtration, ion exchange, and hydroxylapatite), it was determined that the islet secretory granules contained only one detectable CP B. This enzyme is present in both secretory granule- and microsome-enriched subcellular fractions and is membrane associated at pH 5.2. The specific activity of the islet CP B was approximately 4-fold higher in the secretory granule- and microsome-enriched subcellular fractions than in the lysosome-enriched fraction. It is a metallo-enzyme that is stimulated by Co++, and has a pH optimum in the range of 5.2-6.2. The isoelectric point of the islet CP B is at pH 4.9. The enzyme is a glycoprotein and has an approximate molecular size of Mr 30,000 by gel filtration. The substrate analogs guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, guanidinopropylsuccinic acid, and aminopropylmercaptosuccinic acid competitively inhibited the islet CP B with inhibition constant (Ki) values of 23, 21, and 230 nM, respectively. In experiments employing purified prohormone substrates it was demonstrated that the action of a CP B-like enzyme was required for the complete processing of anglerfish proinsulin and prosomatostatin-II. These results indicate that the anglerfish islet CP B is involved in prohormone processing and has properties which are very similar to those of enkephalin convertase.\r"

We therefore studied the effects of prepubertal castration on the pubertal IGF-I surge and demonstrate that castration provokes a further increase rather than ablation of the pubertal IGF-I surge in the rat. Furthermore, neonatal treatment with monosodium glutamate, a hypothalamic neurotoxin, abolishes the pubertal IGF-I surge when commenced on postnatal day 1 but not on day 5, whereas treatment with a GnRH antagonist commencing within 12 h of birth significantly reduces but does not abolish the pubertal IGF-I surge. We therefore propose that the pubertal IGF-I surge in the rat is not due to direct gonadal secretion of IGF-I or other gonadal hormones during puberty but may involve hypothalamic and/or hepatic programming by events during prenatal or very early postnatal life.\r"

  ".W": "The cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in normal rat pituitary cells separated by centrifugal elutriation was monitored with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Quin 2. GnRH (10(-7) M) induced a rapid rise (6-8 sec) in the gonadotroph's [Ca2+]i, followed by a plateau phase of prolonged elevated [Ca2+]i which lasted about 15 min. The stimulatory effect of GnRH was dose dependent, with an ED50 of 10(-9) M, and was blocked by the potent antagonist [Dp-Glu1,pclPhe2,DTrp3.6]GnRH. GnRH elevated [Ca2+]i only in gonadotroph-enriched cell fractions, whereas TRH and GH-releasing factor (GRF) elevated [Ca2+]i in mammotroph- and somatotroph-enriched cells fractions, respectively. A rapid increase (first phase) in [Ca2+]i induced by GnRH was observed in Ca2+-free medium containing EGTA, but this rapid phase was terminated within 2 min. Readdition of Ca2+ to the medium induced a second slower rise in [Ca2+]i (plateau phase). Addition of K+ caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i, which was dependent on extracellular Ca2+, but was not affected by prior stimulation with GnRH. On the other hand, stimulation of gonadotroph's [Ca2+]i response by GnRH desensitized the cells to a subsequent GnRH challenge within the time frame studied. These findings indicate an elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by GnRH, TRH, and GRF in their respective separated target cells in the rat pituitary. The rise in [Ca2+]i in GnRH-stimulated gonadotrophs originates partly from intracellular Ca2+ pools and partly from influx of Ca2+ across the cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "We have observed both hyperglucagonemia and hypoinsulinemia in adrenalectomized (Adx) dogs. To determine whether these hormonal alterations are related to changes in distribution of islet hormones in the pancreas, we examined the concentration and total mass of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin in the head, body, and tail of the pancreas by immunoassay and immunocytochemistry. We studied 6 normal dogs, 5 Adx dogs deprived of cortisol for 24 h (Adx I) and 5 for 48-72 h (Adx II). In normal dogs, single and double immunocytochemical staining showed that, in contrast to some other species, B (insulin) cells are mostly in the central region of islet, whereas A (glucagon) and D (somatostatin) cells are distributed randomly. This topographic distribution was not altered by adrenalectomy. In normal dogs, insulin concentration (micrograms per g) and total mass (micrograms) were higher in the tail (174 +/- 22, 2001 +/- 396) and body (165 +/- 22, 2850 +/- 600) than in the head (91 +/- 17, 668 +/- 156) of pancreas. Glucagon concentration (micrograms per g) and total mass (micrograms) were 17 +/- 2, 178 +/- 17 in the tail; 9.5 +/- 2, 158 +/- 32 in the body, and negligible (0.78 +/- 0.32, 7 +/- 3) in the head, whereas somatostatin concentration (micrograms per g) and total mass (micrograms) were 0.58 +/- 0.26, 4.20 +/- 1.5 in the T, 0.23 +/- 0.10, 3.9 +/- 1.6 in the B, and 0.22 +/- 0.05, 1.8 +/- 0.6 in the H. The striking finding was that adrenalectomy caused large increases in somatostatin in all three regions of pancreas in both Adx I and Adx II. The total mass of somatostatin in Adx I and Adx II increased 4-fold in the tail (P less than 0.02-0.005), 5-fold in the body (P less than 0.01-0.001), and 7-9-fold in the head (P less than 0.05-0.005) and concentration increased 6-fold in the body (P less than 0.005) and 7- to 8-fold in the head (P less than 0.01-0.001). There were no significant changes in the content of insulin and glucagon after adrenalectomy. Plasma concentration of glucagon increased by 50% in Adx I (P less than 0.005) and 70% in Adx II (P less than 0.02), insulin decreased by 39% (P less than 0.005), 23% (NS), respectively, and somatostatin increased by 258% (P less than 0.001) in Adx II. Thus the adrenal glands appear to play an important role in regulation of the content of somatostatin in pancreatic islets.\r"

In the study of beta hCG production by FOCUS cells, we have developed and employed a series of monoclonal immunoradiometric assays (IRMAs) that detect epitopes unique to beta hCG, alpha hCG, hCG, and sequence-specific regions of the carboxyl-terminal peptide of beta hCG. The cells secrete approximately 15 ng beta hCG/10(6) cells and per 24 h; however, we were unable to detect either hCG or the alpha-subunit. The ectopic beta hCG was subsequently affinity purified from the culture medium and partially characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The mol wt of ectopic beta hCG was approximately 35,000 daltons. Immunochemical analysis of ectopic beta hCG by sequence-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that epitopes corresponding to amino acid sequences 109-115, 121-145, 134-140, and 139-145 of the carboxyl-terminal peptide were present. FOCUS cells also demonstrate an intracytoplasmic localization of beta hCG by immunoperoxidase-staining techniques. Taken together, these findings suggest that FOCUS cells produce and secrete only beta hCG and that thus far, its physical properties appear indistinguishable from those of the native subunit. This unique cell line will be useful to study beta hCG gene(s) regulation as well as the mechanisms of ectopic beta hCG production and secretion.\r"

At the light microscopic level, LH cells were distributed evenly in the gland, but showed a decrease in cell surface area of 10% after 1 month and 23% after 4 months of daily injection of 50 micrograms LHRH-A. At the electron microscopic level, the gonadotrophs from control animals were characterized by the presence of two types of secretory granules and a dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Immunostaining for LH was localized only to secretory granules. LHRH-A administration caused the appearance of glycogen in the cytoplasm. Four months after cessation of the treatment, the gonadotrophs showed a normal cytological appearance, thus indicating full reversibility of the morphological changes induced by long-term treatment with an LHRH-A.\r"

  ".W": "The nucleomyofibrillar fraction of epididymides from sexually mature rabbits contains a novel leupeptin-sensitive protease that disrupts the oligomeric conformation of cytosolic estrogen and progesterone receptors, and molybdate inhibits this process. In this report we used the AtT-20 cell glucocorticoid receptor as substrate and performed analyses under nondenaturing vs. denaturing conditions to further investigate the effects of the epididymal protease and molybdate on steroid receptor structure. Analysis on low salt sucrose gradients indicated that the protease partially converted the oligomeric (9-10S) glucocorticoid receptor to several more slowly sedimenting forms (3-7S), and this effect was not observed in the presence of molybdate. Paradoxically, gradient analysis under high salt conditions revealed that the protease induced a discrete, quantitative and molybdate-insensitive conversion of the 4-5S steroid-binding subunit to a 3S form. Further studies were done using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of receptor that had been labeled covalently with [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate and partially purified by DNA/cellulose chromatography. At 0-4 C, the protease cleaved the steroid-binding subunit (mol wt, 96,900) of the receptor to a single steroid-labeled fragment (mol wt, 42,600). Under these conditions, digestion was complete within 30-60 min and was inhibited by leupeptin, but was unaffected by thiol-reactive reagents or molybdate. The epididymal protease and alpha-chymotrypsin produced steroid-labeled receptor fragments that were indistinguishable in size, shared an epitope recognized by our BuGR-2 monoclonal antibody, and retained DNA-binding activity. Despite the apparent similarity of these two enzymes, they are distinct, since the chymotrypsin-dependent cleavage event was not inhibited by leupeptin. These studies show that the epididymal protease attacks a site on the steroid-binding subunit of glucocorticoid receptors as well as estrogen and progestin receptors. It also appears that the cleavage site is situated close to that most readily attacked by alpha-chymotrypsin. Finally, our data provide independent confirmation of a recent report indicating that molybdate ions interact directly with the cytosolic steroid receptor to stabilize its oligomeric structure even after proteolysis within the steroid-binding subunit.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic administration of human GH (mol wt, 22,000; 22K-hGH) is known to generate insulin resistance in dogs. However, recent hypotheses claim that diabetogenicity may be attributable to smaller weight contaminants or fragments not found in purified lower weight hGH (mol wt, 20,000; 20K-hGH) also secreted by the pituitary. In this study, we examined the effects of chronic (12-day) low dose (0.02 mg/kg X day) infusion of recombinant DNA-derived methionyl 22K- and 20K-hGH on glucose tolerance in conscious dogs. Minimal model analysis of the frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance tests quantified insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness, the ability of glucose per se to normalize its own concentration. Infusion of 22K-hGH, raising plasma hGH levels to 3.8 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, resulted in an elevation in fasting glucose levels after 2 days of infusion (104 +/- 1 vs. pre-hGH 97 +/- 2 mg/dl; P less than 0.01), but the effect was transient. No change was noted during 20K-hGH treatment (P greater than 0.2). Mildly elevated fasting insulin levels were observed in both 22K- and 20K-hGH-treated dogs (P less than 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). However, despite maintenance of adequate glucose tolerance during both infusions (P greater than 0.07), marked insulin resistance was apparent; insulin sensitivity dropped from 9.7 +/- 2.4 and 11.2 +/- 2.1 X 10(-4) min-1/(microU/ml) in 22K- and 20K-hGH-treated dogs, to 2.5 and 2.8 X 10(-4) min-1/(microU/ml), a drop of 75% (P less than 0.01 and 0.001). Insulin resistance persisted throughout the infusion period, slowly returning to pre-hGH treatment levels in 22K-hGH-treated dogs during recovery. Insulin resistance persisted 3 days after cessation of 20K-hGH treatment (day 15), but returned to pre-hGH levels by day 25. Integrated glucose-stimulated insulin release was enhanced after 2 days of 22K- or 20K-hGH treatment (P less than 0.03 and less than 0.05), but the effect was transient. Maintenance of normal glucose tolerance in the face of severe insulin resistance and only transiently elevated insulin response was possible because glucose effectiveness remained unchanged. In conclusion, despite minimal effects of low dose hGH infusion on glucose tolerance and fasting glucose and insulin levels, 22K- and 20K-hGH are equipotent in generating severe insulin resistance and potentiating glucose-stimulated insulin release.\r"

The lamprey GnRH molecule is structurally distinct from other known vertebrate GnRHs and is the first identified molecule in this family to have different amino acids in the third and sixth positions. These data suggest that the presence of Tyr3 or Glu6 in lamprey GnRH may account for the lack of biological activity in the representatives of the two different vertebrate classes investigated in this study.\r"

The labeling of this protein was greatly increased by concurrent treatment of the cells with N-ethylmaleimide, to the extent that the amount of [125I]-insulin cross-linked to the enzyme in these cells was approximately 20 to 50% that cross-linked to the insulin receptor.

These results indicate that commercially available porcine GIP-preparations may contain the biologically inactive des-tyr-ala-GIP(3-42) in high amounts, and in addition may be contaminated by CCK-peptides. HPLC-characterization of these peptide preparations prior to any biological study is crucial.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the potential role of hormones and growth factors in ovarian follicular growth, we have developed a simple method for the evaluation of DNA synthesis in cultured porcine granulosa cells. Optimal conditions were found to entail newly established cultures that were growth arrested by serum deprivation and then treated with growth-promoting agents. Such treatment resulted in an easily quantitated 3- to 30-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable macromolecules. The radioactivity incorporated was localized to the DNA band on cesium chloride gradients and showed excellent correlation with labeling indices. Insulin, multiplication-stimulating activity, epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and ovarian follicular fluid were potent stimulators of DNA synthesis in this assay. While EGF and insulin effects were additive, indicating discrete modes of action, the effects of insulin and multiplication-stimulating activity were not additive at maximally effective concentrations. In contrast to the effects of these stimulatory substances, BSA and porcine relaxin were devoid of mitogenic activity under these circumstances. The major trophic hormones implicated in follicular growth, FSH, LH, and estradiol, as well as the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP were without mitogenic effects. Instead, treatment with LH, 8-bromo-cAMP, and the combination of estradiol and FSH resulted in a distinct decrease in DNA synthesis. These data confirm and extend previous evidence of the mitogenic action of insulin-like peptides and EGF, and suggest that the hormones generally believed to regulate granulosa cell replication in vivo lack direct mitogenic effects in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "87105344\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate whether the hypothalamus is the site of action of CRF in inhibiting LH levels in female rats, we measured hypophysial-portal blood concentrations of immunoreactive GnRH (irGnRH) after the central injection of CRF. Ovine CRF (0.1, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 nmol) was injected intracerebroventricularly to intact rats on the afternoon of proestrus and in long term ovariectomized (OVX) rats in the presence or in absence of estradiol benzoate (OVX + EB). CRF injection decreased the amplitude of the proestrous irGnRH surge without affecting presurge levels. CRF (0.1 nmol) attenuated the afternoon irGnRH surge in OVX + EB rats; higher doses of CRF blocked this surge and decreased nonsurge irGnRH levels. No dose-related alterations of irGnRH levels were observed in OVX rats; only the highest dose of CRF was active. For comparison, plasma LH concentrations were measured after a single dose of CRF (2 nmol) in rats under the same experimental conditions. While CRF decreased LH concentrations in anesthetized proestrous and OVX + EB rats, it was inactive in OVX rats. In contrast, CRF injection in awake rats did decrease LH concentrations in all experimental conditions, suggesting that in OVX rats, the anesthetic (Saffan) used during portal blood collection affected CRF action on LH secretion. Indeed, the observation that the LH response to opiate receptor blockade with naloxone (2.5 mg/kg) in anesthetized OVX rats was different compared to that in awake rats suggested that the ineffectiveness of CRF to decrease irGnRH and LH in OVX anesthetized rats was related to the action of the anesthetic on the opioid system. The existence of a putative CRF-opioid interaction in the inhibitory control of LH secretion was supported by the effectiveness of naloxone to reverse the CRF-induced decrease in LH levels in EB-treated and untreated OVX rats. These results indicate that CRF attenuates LH secretion by a central action to inhibit irGnRH release into the hypophysial-portal circulation and that this action is independent of basal concentrations of irGnRH and/or LH. Moreover, the present results support the involvement of endogenous opioids in mediating the effect of CRF on LH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human thyroglobulin (hTg) was obtained by somatic fusion of the nonsecreting myeloma cell line P3X66 Ag8/0 and spleen cells of Balb/c mice immunized with purified hTg. Antibody secreting clones were selected by solid phase enzyme immunoassay and analyzed for cross-reaction with Tg from several animal species. Twelve out of 15 mAbs cross-reacted with both rat and mouse Tg and 11 Mabs cross-reacted with bovine Tg. The cross-reaction with mouse Tg paralleled that of rat Tg, whereas discrete differences between the cross-reactivity patterns with bovine Tg were observed. Two clones secreted mAbs specific for hTg. We further characterized the mAbs and found that three mAbs recognized T4-containing determinants and one mAb reacted with both T4 and T3-containing determinants on the Tg molecule. The binding of the mAbs to hormonogenic determinants depended upon the thyroid hormone content of the molecule and the integrity of the three dimensional structure of Tg. One other mAb reacted with four peptides of CNBr-cleaved hTg, indicating the recognition of a repetitive determinant in the hTg molecule distinct from the hormonogenic regions.\r"

In these studies we examined the gonadotroph as a possible site of action of EtOH by treating cultured pituitary cells with several concentrations of EtOH (200, 400, or 800 mg/100 ml) for 4 days. Cells were incubated for 2 h with LHRH on the last day of the experiment. Whereas basal LH release was unaffected over the 4 days of EtOH treatment, the LH response to LHRH was inhibited by EtOH in a dose-related fashion. Inhibitory responses at the lowest concentration of EtOH (200 mg/100 ml) occurred inconsistently. At the highest concentration (800 mg/100 ml), the curve of log LHRH dose vs. LH release had a lower maximum and was shifted to the right of that for untreated cells. Total LH content and total number of cells attached to the culture wells were unchanged after EtOH treatment. These data suggest that EtOH at high concentrations can lower the responsiveness of the gonadotroph to LHRH.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in mediating acute stimulatory PRL responses was investigated in conscious male rats. Electrolytic lesions, verified histologically at autopsy, were stereotaxically made in the PVN region, and sham lesions were made in control rats. Blood was obtained through a chronically indwelling catheter in the right atrium. PVN-lesioned (PVL) rats showed significantly lower T3 levels 1 week after surgery (less than 34.4 ng/dl) compared with sham (mean +/- SEM, 91.2 +/- 5.0 ng/dl) and intact (86.8 +/- 2.0 ng/dl) animals, verifying a lesion in the PVN. T3 was restored to normal (95.6 +/- 1.8 ng/dl) by daily sc administration of T4 (10 micrograms/kg BW) for at least 4 days before the day of the experiments. Basal PRL levels in PVL rats did not differ significantly from those in control or sham-lesioned animals. In response to restraint stress, plasma PRL levels of PVL rats did not rise, in contrast to marked elevation in PRL in sham and intact rats [PRL levels (mean +/- SEM; nanograms per ml), basal to peak: PVL, 4.3 +/- 0.3 to 4.5 +/- 0.4; sham, 4.5 +/- 0.5 to 47.0 +/- 4.1; intact, 4.0 +/- 0.3 to 46.3 +/- 4.9]. PVL also resulted in the complete inhibition of PRL secretion induced by 30-min inhalation of ether (basal to peak: PVL, 3.3 +/- 0.3 to 4.5 +/- 0.2; sham, 5.7 +/- 0.8 to 19.9 +/- 0.9; intact, 3.3 +/- 0.4 to 27.9 +/- 4.0). The stimulatory effect on plasma PRL in sham and intact rats by one iv bolus injection of the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP; 10 mg/kg BW) was completely abolished in PVL animals (basal to peak: PVL, 3.7 +/- 0.6 to 5.2 +/- 1.4; sham, 6.7 +/- 0.6 to 36.0 +/- 0.5; intact, 4.1 +/- 1.2 to 33.3 +/- 3.2). In contrast to the marked alteration in PRL regulation, PVL rats exhibited a typical ultradian rhythm of plasma GH secretion during a 6-h observation period and increased release of GH induced by iv injection of 5-HTP [GH (nanograms per ml), basal to peak; PVL, 4.5 +/- 0.6 to 21.0 +/- 4.9; sham, 3.7 +/- 0.3 to 18.4 +/- 4.4; intact, 2.9 +/- 0.1 to 17.8 +/- 3.5]. These findings indicate that PRL responses to stress and to serotonin act through the PVN, the site of origin of several putative PRL-releasing factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of a new orally effective hypoglycemic compound, linogliride (McN-3935), on insulin release from isolated perifused rat islets was investigated. At a concentration of 100 microM, linogliride was without effect on insulin secretion in the absence of glucose. While 5.5 mM glucose alone produced a weak secretagogue effect, the secretory response was dramatically (5- to 6-fold) increased by the addition of 100 microM linogliride. This concentration of linogliride did not affect the conversion of [5-3H]glucose to 3H2O, a measure of the rate of glycolysis by the islet. Insulin secretion in response to the combination of 100 microM linogliride and 5.5 mM glucose was abolished by the omission of extracellular calcium. Mannoheptulose (10 mM), an inhibitor of glucose phosphorylation and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, markedly attenuated the insulinotropic effect of linogliride in parallel with reduced glucose usage. Paradoxically, in the presence of another metabolic inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (10 mM), the insulinotropic effect of linogliride (100 microM) in the presence of 5.5 mM glucose was not diminished despite the reduced glucose usage. Linogliride significantly increased the secretory response to other secretagogues, including 2.5 mM D-glyceraldehyde, 15 mM N-acetylglucosamine, 10 mM leucine, and 100 nM of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. These data suggest that linogliride amplifies a cellular signal generated during beta-cell activation by various stimulants.\r"

Ovarian hormones also effect the concentrations of NPY in hypothalamic nuclei, and some of the changes are similar to those caused by LHRH. The present studies tested whether NPY acts directly on the pituitary gland, either alone or in combination with LHRH, to modify LH secretion. Hemipituitary fragments obtained from ovariectomized rats were incubated in medium 199, and the in vitro effects on LH release of LHRH, NPY, or the two peptides together were assessed. As expected, LHRH (10(-9)-10(-7) M) produced a dose-dependent release of LH, whereas NPY alone had a lesser stimulatory effect at concentrations of 10(-7) or 10(-6) M. On the other hand, 10(-6) M NPY significantly enhanced LH release in response to 10(-9) M LHRH. A potentiation by NPY of the LHRH-induced LH response was observed in an anterior pituitary cell culture system. Cells from the pituitaries of ovariectomized rats were dispersed and cultured for 3 days in medium 199 with BSA, gentamicin, horse serum, and fetal calf serum. During a 3-h incubation, NPY alone (10(-9)-10(-7) M) failed to affect LH release, but significantly potentiated the release induced by 10(-9) or 10(-8) M LHRH. These findings are in accord with the hypothesis that hypothalamic NPY neurons may participate in the regulation of LH secretion in the rat and indicate that one of the mechanisms of its action may be to increase the pituitary LH response to LHRH.\r"

Such a substance has been identified which is released from liver plasma membranes after exposure to insulin. This substance was purified on sequential ion exchange, reverse phase, and gel permeations columns. The purified substance modulated the activities of cAMP phosphodiesterase, adenylate cyclase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase. The activities that modulated each of these enzymes exhibited singular chromatographic behavior and sensitivity to a variety of chemical reagents. Each activity was also produced by treatment of membranes with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. These results suggested that each of the enzyme-modulating activities was due to a single complex carbohydrate substance which contained inositol, phosphate, glucosamine, and other monosaccharides. The actions of this substance on these three enzymes mimicked those of insulin, suggesting that the release of this enzyme modulator might play a role in mediating some of the actions of the hormone.\r"

In the basal state, epinephrine increased arterial concentrations of glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and free fatty acids (FFA) as well as splanchnic output of glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate and splanchnic FFA more than cortisol. Postprandially, C-peptide release and hyperinsulinemia were blunted by epinephrine initially and increased less thereafter than during cortisol infusion. The rise in arterial glucose after glucose ingestion as calculated by the area under the curve was more marked (P less than .01) after epinephrine [( 1.90 +/- 0.08 M) 150 min] and cortisol [( 1.41 +/- 0.05 M) 150 min] than in the control study [( 1.07 +/- 0.04 M) 150 min]. In parallel, the stress hormones induced an almost identical 24 and 31% rise in mean splanchnic glucose output versus control values (normal, 44.8 +/- 2.5; cortisol, 55.3 +/- 3.3; epinephrine, 58.9 +/- 6.9 g/150 min). The associated rise in arterial concentrations and splanchnic output of insulin above control values was considerably greater during cortisol but unchanged during epinephrine exposure. Epinephrine but not cortisol induced a rise versus the control study in splanchnic uptake of lactate and FFA, as well as in pyruvate output, whereas plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate remained unchanged. The postprandial splanchnic glucose output-to-splanchnic C-peptide output ratio did not differ from normal during epinephrine but was reduced (P less than .01) during cortisol administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, both free and bound IRI were measured in nine type I diabetics who were treated sequentially for 3 wk with constant doses of conventional beef-pork, biosynthetic human, and beef-pork insulins (phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The aggregate accounted for 19 +/- 5.7, 38 +/- 7.7, and 26 +/- 7% of bound IRI, and 19 +/- 8.3, 35 +/- 7.3, and 31 +/- 5.0% of free IRI during phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Taken as concentrations (microU/ml), the absolute amounts of aggregate in the bound fraction were significantly (P less than .001) greater than those that were free, whereas the ratios of aggregate to monomer within each pool were similar (P greater than .1). The relative and absolute amounts of the insulin aggregate during each of the three treatment phases (compared by analysis of variance) were indistinguishable (P greater than 0.5). However, the aggregate was overestimated by a factor of approximately 2 when measurements were made on the basis of an insulin-monomer standard. We conclude that both the bound and free fractions of IRI contain insulin aggregate. Overreactivity of the aggregate in the radioimmunoassay contributes to the so-called hyperinsulinism of type I diabetes. As with insulin monomer, most of the 12,000-Mr aggregate is bound to antibodies. Because some of the aggregate is free, its biologic consequences must be assessed.\r"

Cultured human lymphocytes (IM-9) were incubated with varying concentrations of heparin, then extensively washed, and 125I-labeled insulin binding was measured. Heparin at concentrations used clinically for anticoagulation (1-50 U/ml) inhibited binding in a dose-dependent manner; 50% inhibition of binding occurred with 5-10 U/ml. Scatchard analysis indicated that the decrease in binding was due to a decrease in both the affinity and the apparent number of available insulin receptors. The effect occurred within 10 min at 22 degrees C and persisted even after the cells were extensively washed. Inhibition of insulin binding also occurred when cells were preincubated with heparinized plasma or heparinized serum but not when cells were incubated with normal serum or plasma from blood anticoagulated with EDTA. By contrast, other polyanions and polycations, e.g., poly-L-glutamic acid, poly-L-lysine, succinylated poly-L-lysine, and histone, did not inhibit binding. Heparin also inhibited insulin binding in Epstein-Barr (EB) virus-transformed lymphocytes but had no effect on insulin binding to isolated adipocytes, human erythrocytes, or intact hepatoma cells. When isolated adipocytes were incubated with heparin, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation and, to a lesser extent, of basal glucose oxidation. Although heparin has no effect on insulin binding to intact hepatoma cells, heparin inhibited both insulin binding and insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation in receptors solubilized from these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A longitudinal study of 266 randomly selected nondiabetic Nauruans [215 with normal tolerance and 51 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)] over 6 yr showed that deterioration in glucose tolerance status had occurred in 61 subjects. Of the subjects with initially normal tolerance, 34 (16%) progressed to IGT and 14 (6.5%) progressed to diabetes. Thirteen of the subjects with IGT (25%) progressed to diabetes. Subjects were examined in 1975 through 1976, and follow-up examinations were performed in 1982. After age, a high 2-h plasma insulin response to a glucose load was the factor most predictive of progression from normal tolerance to both diabetes (P less than .001) and IGT (P less than .01). Both a high 2-h glucose level and greater obesity independently predicted progression from IGT, and a diminished 2-h insulin response just failed to significantly improve the model (P less than .06). The negative parameter of the insulin response associated with deterioration from IGT differed significantly (P less than .01) from the positive-parameter estimate of the response associated with progression to diabetes from normal tolerance (P less than .01), implying a qualitative difference between these nondiabetic subgroups. The use of a glucose-insulin interaction term to predict progression to diabetes for all nondiabetic subjects confirmed this difference; this term's addition improved the model (P less than .01), and progression to diabetes was associated with a high insulin response for 2-h glucose less than 7.8 mM but a low response for 2-h glucose greater than 7.8 mM.\r"

L-Leucine and 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate also stimulated insulin secretion. In the RINm5F cells, as in normal islet cells, the nonmetabolized analogue of L-leucine, 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), activated glutamate dehydrogenase, augmented L-[U-14C]glutamine oxidation, and induced a more reduced state of cytosolic redox couples. However, in sharp contrast to either its effect in normal islet cells or that of D-glucose in the tumoral cells, BCH severely decreased O2 uptake, lowered the ATP/ADP ratio, increased 86Rb outflow, and inhibited insulin release in the RINm5F cells. These findings are interpreted to support the concept that the rate of ATP generation represents an essential determinant of the secretory response of insulin-producing cells to nutrient secretagogues.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus in humans is associated with increased plasma and tissue levels of cAMP and decreased cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. Calmodulin (CM) is a low-molecular-weight protein essential for activation of cAMP PDE. The inhibitor (INH) is a low-molecular-weight substance that inhibits the activity of CM in multiple systems, including PDE. Spontaneously diabetic BB rats (SDR) and their nondiabetic littermates (NDR) were used in this study. Holtzman rats were rendered diabetic by streptozocin (STZ). STZ-induced diabetic rats (STZ-DR) and BB rats were studied with and without the benefit of insulin therapy. Calmodulin was assayed both by bioassay and by specific radioimmunoassay. The inhibitor was bioassayed by its ability to inhibit CM-activated PDE. Results showed that both spontaneous and STZ-induced diabetes are associated with a decrease in activity of the low-Michaelis constant (Km) cAMP PDE in the liver (39%, SDR; 70% STZ-DR). Calmodulin activity was also decreased in the livers of both animals (13%, SDR; 68%, STZ-DR). Similar data were obtained for NDRs. The inhibitor, on the other hand, was increased in the livers of untreated SDRs and STZ-DRs (155%, SDR; 125%, STZ-DR). No change was noted for NDRs. All these changes were restored toward normal after treatment with insulin. These data suggest that in diabetes the defect in the cAMP PDE-CM-INH system is demonstrated in both an environmental model, as illustrated by STZ-DRs, and a genetic model, as shown by SDRs and NDRs. The inhibitor activity, however, is not changed significantly in NDRs. We speculate that the inhibitor activity plays a role in dictating whether the genetic NDR will or will not become clinically diabetic.\r"

  ".W": "Midaglizole (DG-5128), 2-[2-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1-phenylethyl]pyridine dihydrochloride sesquihydrate, is a novel alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Its effects on plasma glucose, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), and immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) in healthy male volunteers were investigated. Volunteers received single oral administrations of midaglizole (150-500 mg), multiple increasing oral administration on 3 separate days (150-300 mg 3 times daily), or successive daily oral administration for 1 wk (200 mg 3 times daily). The hypoglycemic action of midaglizole was observed within 0.5-1.0 h after its administration and thereafter for 5 h. The maximum hypoglycemic effect was found 1.0-1.5 h after administration. Midaglizole decreased postprandial hyperglycemia in a dose-dependent manner. In the fasting state, midaglizole significantly increased IRI secretion and suppressed IRG secretion. Midaglizole inhibited epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation after successive administration for 1 wk (200 mg 3 times daily). The plasma half-life of midaglizole was only 3 h, and the drug was rapidly excreted into the urine and feces, with greater than 80% in its unchanged form, within 24 h. Midaglizole did not affect the results of any clinical or laboratory tests performed. Our data indicate that midaglizole is a possible hypoglycemic agent. Further clinical investigations are required to confirm its effects on diabetes mellitus.\r"

In vivo insulin action was measured during a 3-insulin-step, hyperglycemic (approximately 310 mg/dl) clamp with somatostatin (250 micrograms/h). At a clamp plasma insulin concentration of 10 microU/ml, glucose disposal rates did not change after weight loss; at approximately 100 microU/ml, glucose disposal rates increased by 21% [from 4.3 +/- 0.2 to 5.3 +/- 0.4 mg X min-1 X kg-1 of fat-free mass (FFM), P less than .01] mostly due to increased carbohydrate oxidation rates (2.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.8 +/- 0.3 mg X min-1 X kg-1 FFM, P less than .02); at 2400 microU/ml, glucose disposal rates increased by 37% (11.4 +/- 0.6 to 15.6 +/- 1.4 mg X min-1 X kg-1 FFM, P less than .02) mostly due to increased nonoxidative carbohydrate disposal rates or storage (7.5 +/- 0.6 to 10.9 +/- 1.3 mg X min-1 X kg-1 FFM, P less than .04). Sensitivity of glucose disposal to insulin in the physiologic range (measured as change in glucose disposal rate per unit change in insulin concentration between clamps at approximately 10 and approximately 100 microU/ml) was very low in these diabetic subjects and did not change after weight loss. Adipocyte cell size, basal and maximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport, and half-maximal rate for transport did not change after weight loss. The data suggest that insulin in the physiologic range has no apparent effect on glucose disposal in patients with NIDDM before or after weight loss. However, a moderate weight loss is associated with enhanced capacity to transport and metabolize glucose in vivo. The discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro results suggests that the adipocyte may not always reflect in vivo insulin action. Diabetes 36:227-36, 1987.\r"

BBUF rats bear the RT1u major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype that we have shown to be necessary for the expression of this form of IDDM. A T-lymphocyte line obtained from the pancreas of a diabetic rat (UPCC.5) and three T-lymphocyte hybridomas derived by fusing T-lymphocytes of BBUF rats (MUS1.2, MUS1.13, and MUP3.21) respond to islet cell antigens in an MHC-restricted way. UPCC.5 responds to a combination of islet cell antigens (ICAg) and antigen-presenting cells by proliferation, whereas the T-hybridoma responses are detected on the basis of IL-2 production in a similar assay. This study reveals that an antiserum against mu-haplotype MHC antigens or a monoclonal antibody against the product of the D class II subregion of the rat MHC could inhibit ICAg recognition. A monoclonal antibody against the product of the B class II MHC subregion of the rat was not inhibitory. These results suggest that RT1.D antigens (analogous to human DR and mouse I-E) restrict islet cell recognition in this rat model of spontaneous IDDM.\r"

We therefore perfused an isolated canine pancreas via the celiac artery (arterial perfusion) and then via the portal vein (venous perfusion) in the same pancreas. Basal insulin and glucagon levels and their rate of release in response to 10 mM arginine, 11 mM glucose, 500 pg/ml somatostatin, or 500 pg/ml glucagon were similar under both conditions. However, the inhibition of glucagon release due to somatostatin and its recovery after the cessation of somatostatin infusion was poor in the case of venous perfusion. The basal somatostatin level and its release in response to 10 mM arginine, 11 mM glucose, and 500 pg/ml glucagon during venous perfusion was significantly higher than that during arterial perfusion. From these results, it is speculated that the directional blood flow in pancreatic islets may not be essential for regulation of hormone release from the canine pancreas or that such directionality does not exist in canine pancreatic islets, and that a considerable portion of released somatostatin may be taken up by the pancreas located downstream--probably in the exocrine pancreas.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated some self-association properties of monocomponent porcine insulin with a simple and novel procedure that for the first time permits the association properties of insulin to be studied in mixed protein solutions. With this semiquantitative procedure, the monomer form of insulin was separated from aggregates during centrifuge desalting on Sephadex G-25. The proportion of monomer in solutions of insulin was estimated by monitoring [125I]monoiodoinsulin recovery off the gel. The self-association properties of insulin were studied in plasma with this procedure over the concentration range of physiologically circulating levels to storage concentrations of the hormone. We estimated the equilibrium constant for the formation of dimers to be 1.5 X 10(4)/M in pooled human plasma at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. This estimate was indistinguishable from that obtained for insulin in a defined phosphate-albumin buffer under similar conditions. This result provides direct confirmation that insulin is not associated with a circulating serum binding protein(s) and that insulin is present predominantly as a monomer in plasma. We also used the method to investigate the self-association properties of insulin over a wide pH range. The equilibrium constant for the formation of dimers decreased only 6-fold over a 9.2 pH unit increase from pH 2 to 11.2 but almost 200-fold for the additional 1.5 pH unit increase from pH 11.2 to 12.7. We conclude that a residue of pK 12 is critical to the maintenance of the quaternary structure of insulin. We assign this role to the single B22-arginyl residue in insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Elevated rates of basal hepatic glucose output (bHGO) are significantly correlated with the fasting serum glucose (FSG) level in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This observation suggests that bHGO is a major determinant of the severity of the diabetic state in these subjects. In addition, basal glucagon levels (bGL) are higher in these diabetics than in control subjects, despite the concurrent basal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, two factors known to suppress glucagon secretion. Although bGL is responsible for sustaining two-thirds of bHGO in normal humans, its role in sustaining elevated rates of bHGO in NIDDM has not been previously defined. To this end, we have studied 13 normal and 10 NIDDM subjects; mean FSG levels were 90 +/- 2 and 262 +/- 21 mg/dl, respectively (P less than .001). The mean fasting serum insulin and glucagon levels were higher in the diabetics than in the controls: 17 +/- 2 vs. 9 +/- 1 microU/ml (P less than .01) and 208 +/- 37 vs. 104 +/- 15 pg/ml (P less than .01), respectively. On separate days, HGO was assessed isotopically (with 3-[3H]glucose) in the basal state and during infusion of somatostatin (SRIF) (600 micrograms/h) alone and in conjunction with replacement infusions of glucose and insulin. The results demonstrate that bHGO is higher in diabetics than in controls (145 +/- 12 vs. 89 +/- 3 mg X m-2 X min-1, P less than .01); during infusion of SRIF alone, HGO was suppressed by 25% (P less than .05) and 34% (P less than .05) of the basal value in controls and diabetics, respectively; when the studies were repeated with glucose levels held constant at or near the FSG level by the glucose-clamp technique, the pattern and degree of HGO suppression was similar to that obtained by infusion of SRIF alone; during isolated glucagon deficiency (SRIF + insulin, 5 mU X m-2 min-1, with serum glucose maintained at basal level), HGO was suppressed by 71 +/- 8% of the basal value in controls (P less than .001) and by 58 +/- 7% in diabetics (P less than .001); and when isolated glucagon deficiency with similar hyperglycemia was created in control subjects, HGO was suppressed by 87% of the basal value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Islets were cultured for 3 days in medium containing 2.7 or 16.7 mM glucose, various concentrations of fetal calf serum (FCS), and 100-1000 ng/ml human growth hormone (GH). DNA replication was determined by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into islet DNA; SM-C/IGF-I and insulin secreted into the medium were measured by specific radioimmunoassays. Glucose caused a twofold stimulation of islet DNA replication in medium containing greater than or equal to 1% FCS but failed to stimulate DNA replication at lower serum concentrations. In the presence of 16.7 mM glucose, GH (100-1000 ng/ml) stimulated DNA replication at all serum concentrations. In medium containing 2.7 mM glucose, GH was stimulatory only in the presence of 1% FCS. Somatomedin C/IGF-I release into the culture medium could be detected in all experimental groups. Glucose alone did not affect SM-C/IGF-I release, and in serum concentrations less than 0.1% FCS, GH also failed to increase the release of the peptide. In medium containing 1% FCS and 16.7 mM glucose, 100-1000 ng/ml GH caused a 50-100% increase in SM-C/IGF-I release into the medium. Addition of 100 ng/ml exogenous SM-C/IGF-I to medium containing 16.7 mM glucose and 0.1-1.0% FCS caused a twofold stimulation of the islet DNA replication. This effect could be abolished by the addition of an antibody to SM-C/IGF-I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether immature or defective glucose counterregulation was responsible for the severe recurrent hypoglycemic episodes (3.6 per patient per year) observed during conventional therapy (CT) in six pre-school-age diabetic children, we investigated their metabolic and hormonal responses to insulin infusion (40 mU/kg i.v. for 60 min). Counterregulation was considered adequate because no patient experienced symptoms requiring discontinuation of the test, and blood glucose (BG) nadirs averaged 42 +/- 5 mg/dl. Glucose production rate decreased from 4.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.6 mg X kg-1 X min-1. Blood 3-hydroxybutyrate levels were elevated (approximately 3 mM) and did not change during insulin infusion. The responses of epinephrine (from 137 +/- 37 to 393 +/- 143 pg/ml), norepinephrine (from 145 +/- 33 to 347 +/- 152 pg/ml), and growth hormone (from 6.0 +/- 1.5 to 20.3 +/- 5.1 ng/ml) were normal for this age group. As previously observed in diabetic adults, glucagon response was deficient (from 117 +/- 30 to 114 +/- 18 pg/ml). The six children were subsequently treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), which resulted in a 20-fold decrease in the number of severe hypoglycemic reactions. Predisposition to severe hypoglycemia in this subset of diabetic children, which remains a refractory problem even after considerable efforts have been made to decrease them, may thus be sharply decreased with CSII therapy. During this therapy, a significant inverse correlation appeared between the individual frequency of BG values less than 40 mg/dl and BG nadir during the insulin infusion test (r = .94, P less than .001).\r"

  ".W": "To assess the possible influence of moderate titer insulin antibodies on diabetic glycemic control, we examined insulin-antibody equilibrium binding characteristics, postprandial glucose tolerance, and plasma free-insulin profiles after subcutaneous injection of both porcine and human insulin (0.15 U/kg) in 12 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus under conditions stimulating intensive insulin therapy. The patients' antibodies bound porcine and human insulin indistinguishably, and their plasma glucose and free-insulin profiles after ingestion of a standard meal were similar with both insulins. Initial increases in plasma free-insulin levels after injection of both insulins were negatively correlated with both insulin-antibody binding (r = -.55, P less than .006) and postprandial hyperglycemia (peak level r = -.56, P less than .006); the latter was positively correlated with insulin-antibody binding (r = .48, P less than .02). The effects of insulin antibodies on postprandial plasma free-insulin and glucose levels could be accounted for substantially by the association constant of the high-affinity insulin-antibody binding sites (K1); patients in the highest quartile for K1 had significantly slower initial increments in plasma free insulin (0.31 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.06 microU/min, P less than .05) and greater postprandial hyperglycemia (peak value 237 +/- 10 vs. 166 +/- 12 mg/dl, P less than .001) than patients in the lowest quartile. We conclude that moderate insulin-antibody titers commonly found in insulin-treated patients can slow the early increase in plasma free insulin after subcutaneous injection and that this impairs postprandial glucose tolerance; such an effect may limit the effectiveness of intensive insulin therapy.\r"

However, we recently demonstrated kinetic defects in insulin action in insulin-resistant nondiabetic obese subjects: activation of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was slower and deactivation was faster in obese than in normal subjects. In view of these kinetic defects in peripheral insulin action and of the fact that insulin is normally secreted in a phasic manner after meals, we postulated that the hyperinsulinemia of obesity does not compensate for insulin resistance and that the abnormal kinetics of insulin action in obesity are functionally important. To test this hypothesis, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed in five control (mean age, 33 +/- 2 yr) and five obese (mean age, 41 +/- 5 yr) subjects. All controls had normal glucose tolerance; two obese subjects had normal and three had impaired glucose tolerance. After the results of the OGTTs were available, euglycemic clamp studies were performed in which insulin was infused in a phasic stepped fashion to mimic the rise and fall of mean peripheral insulin levels during the OGTTs. Each subject was clamped at both the \"normal\" and \"obese\" OGTT insulin profiles. During the OGTT, glucose and insulin levels were significantly elevated in the obese subjects compared with controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The assay has been evaluated with solubilized insulin receptors and membrane-bound receptors from human placenta and porcine liver as well as intact cells with the IM-9 cell line. The assay is simple, rapid, and has large capacity. Comparisons of the ethanol-based assay to the conventionally employed assays with polyethylene glycol or microfuge centrifugation for the separation of free and bound 125I-insulin revealed large discrepancies between the assays. The ethanol-based assay always appeared to provide a better separation. Microfuge centrifugation of placental membranes precipitated approximately 3% of the ethanol-precipitable insulin-receptor complex, while polyethylene glycol precipitation of solubilized insulin receptors varied between 40 and 80% of the ethanol precipitability, depending on the receptor concentration employed.\r"

Initially the mice demonstrate an abundant beta-cell mass and hyperinsulinemia, which is followed by apparent beta-cell loss. As an index of insulin synthesis, this study assesses pancreatic proinsulin mRNA, measured by dot hybridization to cloned cDNA, during the development of diabetes in the mice. Changes in proinsulin mRNA from 5 to 13 wk of age are compared with serum insulin, pancreatic insulin content, and blood glucose. In control (+/db) mice, total proinsulin mRNA and pancreatic insulin content increased with age. Both changes were proportional to an increase in body weight. Obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia were evident in diabetic (db/db) mice at 5 wk of age. Although pancreatic insulin content was comparable to that in the +/db controls at 5 wk, a fourfold relative elevation of proinsulin mRNA was observed. Despite an increase in body weight, proinsulin mRNA concentration and total proinsulin mRNA fell to levels similar to those of the control mice at 10 and 13 wk, associated with a loss of hyperinsulinemia, a mild decrease in pancreatic insulin content, and a marked increased in fasting blood glucose. A separate group of db/db mice was pair fed with the +/db controls from 4 to 13 wk.

  ".W": "Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in humans is accompanied by an attenuation of the response of glucagon to hypoglycemia. To identify an animal model of IDDM with alpha-cell unresponsiveness to glucopenia in which to pursue morphologic and in vitro functional investigation of the lesion, pancreases isolated from rats with IDDM induced by streptozocin (STZ) or occurring spontaneously in BB/W rats were perfused with buffer containing 150, 25, and 150 mg/dl of glucose. In both forms of IDDM the normal glucagon rise during glucopenia was markedly impaired, suggesting an abnormality comparable to that of human IDDM. Studies of the insular sympathetic apparatus were conducted in these rat models. Electron-microscopic examination of peri-insular nerve endings disclosed no discernible abnormality in either form of rat IDDM. However, morphometric analysis of contacts between [3H]norepinephrine-labeled sympathetic nerve terminals and alpha-cells in pancreases from STZ-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats revealed a 65-70% reduction in direct contacts. An 80% reduction in the number of nerve endings (not labeled) in direct contact with alpha-cells was also noted in the BB/W diabetic rats. Norepinephrine reuptake, studied only in the STZ-D group, was not impaired. The availability of local endogenous norepinephrine to alpha-cells and their sensitivity to exogenous norepinephrine was determined by perfusing 2, 5, or 10 micrograms/ml of tyramine, a releaser of endogenous norepinephrine, and norepinephrine at a concentration that in pancreases from nondiabetic rats gave a quantitatively similar glucagon response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine whether the dose-dependent effect of glucagon on gluconeogenesis parallels its effect on hepatic glycogenolysis in conscious overnight-fasted dogs. Endogenous insulin and glucagon secretion were inhibited by somatostatin (0.8 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1), and intraportal replacement infusions of insulin (213 +/- 28 microU X kg-1 X min-1) and glucagon (0.65 ng X kg-1 X min-1) were given to maintain basal hormone concentrations for 2 h (12 +/- 2 microU/ml and 108 +/- 23 pg/ml, respectively). The glucagon infusion was then increased 2-, 4-, 8-, or 12-fold for 3 h, whereas the rate of insulin infusion was left unchanged. Glucose production (GP) was determined with 3-[3H]glucose, and gluconeogenesis (GNG) was assessed with tracer (U-[14C]alanine conversion to [14C]glucose) and arteriovenous difference (hepatic fractional extraction of alanine, FEA) techniques. Increases in plasma glucagon of 53 +/- 8, 199 +/- 48, 402 +/- 28, and 697 +/- 149 pg/ml resulted in initial (15-30 min) increases in GP of 1.1 +/- 0.4 (N = 4), 4.9 +/- 0.5 (N = 4), 6.5 +/- 0.6 (N = 6), and 7.7 +/- 1.4 (N = 4) mg X kg-1 X min-1, respectively; increases in GNG (approximately 3 h) of 48 +/- 19, 151 +/- 50, 161 +/- 25, and 157 +/- 7%, respectively; and increases in FEA (3 h) of 0.14 +/- 0.07, 0.37 +/- 0.05, 0.42 +/- 0.04, and 0.40 +/- 0.17, respectively. In conclusion, GNG and glycogenolysis were similarly sensitive to stimulation by glucagon in vivo, and the dose-response curves were markedly parallel.\r"

From studies of CT and cerebrovascular pathology, it has become clear that it is the cerebral infarct rather than the arterial occlusion that provides the key piece of information in deciding whether and when anticoagulants should be considered for the secondary prevention of cardiac emboli among patients who present with a clinical stroke.\r"

Forty nine per cent of Crohn's disease patients, 10% of ulcerative colitis patients and 3% of control sera reacted against lymph nodes of mice injected injected with ulcerative colitis intestinal tissue filtrates, 18% of Crohn's disease sera were with intestinal tissue homogenate from Dutch Crohn's patients.

Lymph nodes from 18 of the 19 mice injected with Crohn's disease tissue filtrates reacted with Crohn's disease sera, whereas only three of these 19 mice reacted with ulcerative colitis sera. A comparative study, carried out in parallel with Crohn's disease filtrate induced hyperplastic lymph nodes from the Bilthoven colony (W2) and from the New York colony (E671) using sera from 54 Crohn's disease patients from Leiden, showed immunoreactivity with 44 and 57% of the Crohn's disease sera against the two hyperplastic lymph nodes.

Of these 75 patients, 47 (62.7%) had episodes of acute exacerbation (ALT greater than 300 IU per liter) within 3 months prior to HBeAg seroconversion. All of these 47 patients had high hepatitis B virus DNA levels (greater than 1,000 pg per ml) at the onset of acute exacerbation. Their serum hepatitis B virus DNA disappears shortly before or simultaneously with the HBeAg clearance in 27 patients (57.4%) and persisted but with decreasing levels for 2 to 40 months in 20 patients. Most of these patients had high alpha-fetoprotein levels or evidence of bridging hepatic necrosis. In contrast, the serum hepatitis B virus DNA was undetectable for a minimum of 3 (3-17) months in the 28 patients who had an uneventful course before HBeAg seroconversion. Twenty of these 28 patients had well-documented episodes of acute exacerbation with high hepatitis B virus DNA levels, but with normal alpha-fetoprotein and little evidence of extensive necrosis as far back as 6 to 27 months before HBeAg seroconversion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sera from 31 consecutive patients were tested, 15 patients had primary biliary cirrhosis and 16 non-primary biliary cirrhosis. Antimitochondrial antibodies were investigated under code by immunofluorescence, and primary biliary cirrhosis-specific subtypes were determined by radioimmunoassay (anti-p62, anti-p48) and complement fixation test (anti-M2, anti-M4, anti-M8). Before orthotopic liver transplantation, antimitochondrial antibodies were detected by immunofluorescence in 13 of 15 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Of these patients, 12 were positive for anti-p62 and 8 for anti-p48. Ten patients were positive for anti-M2, 4 patients for anti-M4 and 7 patients for anti-M8. Two primary biliary cirrhosis patients and all non-primary biliary cirrhosis patients were negative with all tests. One month after orthotopic liver transplantation, antimitochondrial antibodies titers declined or became negative by antimitochondrial antibodies immunofluorescence, 3 patients became negative by radioimmunoassay for anti-p62 and 1 for anti-p48. With complement fixation test, 4 patients became negative for anti-M2, 2 for anti-M4 and 4 for anti-M8.

Plasma noradrenaline concentration and plasma renin activity as well as systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics were measured in 12 patients with cirrhosis and ascites before and after administration of either 150 micrograms of clonidine or placebo. Plasma noradrenaline concentration significantly decreased in all patients after clonidine administration, whereas plasma renin activity did not change significantly. There were statistically significant reductions of cardiac output (-17.4%), mean arterial pressure (-12.2%), hepatic venous pressure gradient (-19.7%) and azygos blood flow (-26.6%) after administration of clonidine. No significant correlation was found between the reduction of plasma noradrenaline concentration and changes in systemic or splanchnic hemodynamics. Hepatic blood flow was not changed by clonidine. Placebo administration had no effect on any laboratory or hemodynamic measurement. We conclude that the reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity by clonidine and the subsequent decrease in the hyperdynamic circulation suggests that sympathetic overactivity contributes to the circulatory derangements in patients with cirrhosis.\r"

Better understanding of the disease has been hampered by the lack of a good animal model on which hypotheses of its pathogenesis could be tested. Human studies indicate that a primary mitochondrial injury may lead to complex metabolic disturbances that produce the observed pathophysiology. Specific directions regarding avenues for future research should pursue two lines: a good animal model still needs to be developed in which the biochemical and morphologic alterations identified in Reye's syndrome are duplicated. This model should include an antecedent viral illness but may not require aspirin exposure as an essential ingredient. With the identification of a satisfactory model, specific questions about the roles of environmental toxins or medications may be answered. Study of noncomatose cases of Reye's syndrome should continue. The specific emphasis should be to delineate what factors (NH3, free fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids) may be implicated in the pathogenesis of the CNS disease with the hopes of devising strategies for more effective treatment of encephalopathy and its attendant morbidity and mortality.\r"

During an average follow-up of 23.5 months, acute exacerbations occurred in 197 HBeAg-positive patients and in 56 anti-HBe positive patients, with a calculated annual incidence of 28.6 and 10.3%, respectively (p less than 0.001). The clinical and laboratory findings of acute exacerbations were similar in the HBeAg-positive and anti-HBe positive patients. The mean serum bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein levels were higher in anti-HBe positive patients (p less than 0.01), but actual differences were small. The histologic features of acute exacerbations were also similar in the HBeAg-positive patients and anti-HBe positive patients. Lobular alterations were the main histologic findings; in addition, one-fourth of patients had bridging necrosis and one-fourth had piecemeal necrosis. Spontaneous reactivation of hepatitis B was the major cause of these exacerbations in both HBeAg-positive patients (91.5%) as well as anti-HBe positive patients (62.5%). Hepatitis delta virus superinfection accounted for a higher percentage of exacerbations in anti-HBe positive patients (14.3%) than in HBeAg-positive cases (6.5%). Hepatitis A and possibly non-A, non-B virus superinfections also contributed to some episodes of exacerbation. Thus, acute exacerbations of disease occurred more frequently in HBeAg-positive patients than in anti-HBe positive patients with chronic type B hepatitis, but the clinicopathological features and etiologies were similar.\r"

Polypeptides and glycolipids of liver plasma membrane, liver-specific lipoprotein and kidney membrane were separated and probed with sera from patients and from a rabbit immunized with mouse liver plasma membrane. Chronic active hepatitis sera reacted with a number of polypeptides in the liver plasma membrane preparations; similar but weaker reactivity was observed with sera from patients with other diseases and in some healthy subjects. Chronic active hepatitis sera did not react with glycolipids from liver plasma membrane. The immune rabbit serum reacted with two polypeptides of 180 kd present in liver plasma membrane but absent from kidney membrane, with two polypeptides of 50 kd which were nonliver-specific but species-specific, and with three major glycolipid components of liver plasma membrane: this reactivity thus differed markedly from that of the chronic active hepatitis sera. In studies using dot-blotting, it was found that solubilization of liver plasma membrane in detergents resulted in a marked reduction of the reactivity to liver plasma membrane of chronic active hepatitis sera, but little change in the reactivity of the chronic active hepatitis and other sera with liver-specific lipoprotein by immunoblotting indicated that liver-specific lipoprotein consisted of constituents of liver plasma membrane together with intracellular proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The serum alpha-fetoprotein was elevated in all 20 primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and the average survival of these cases after diagnosis was 4.7 months. Seventy per cent of the mothers of the pediatric primary hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 52.9% of their siblings who were tested also were positive for HBsAg. In addition, two families had clustering of primary hepatocellular carcinoma cases. The occurrence of primary hepatoceullar carcinoma in the pediatric age group suggests the need for close follow-up of young HBsAg-positive carriers. Also, prevention of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus by immunoprophylaxis will significantly decrease both the hepatitis B virus carrier rate and the incidence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in the asian population.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with alcoholic liver disease frequently reveal an increase in IgA serum concentration and IgA deposits in a continuous pattern along hepatic sinusoids. We investigated whether the hepatic IgA deposits are a passive reflection of changes in concentration or composition of IgA in the circulation, or represent a distinct effect of alcohol on the liver. Forty-one patients with alcoholic liver disease (daily alcohol intake at least 50 gm for more than five consecutive years) were compared with 41 patients with nonalcoholic liver disease. Patients in both groups were matched for serum IgA and histopathological changes in the liver biopsy. IgA deposits in the liver were found in 78% of the alcoholic patients and in 12% of the nonalcoholic patients. The presence of deposits was not related to histopathological changes in the liver or to the serum IgA concentration. In serum IgA subclass distribution, alcoholic patients differed from nonalcoholic patients by a slight but significant shift to IgA2; in contrast, the hepatic IgA deposits in alcoholic patients were almost of the IgA1 subclass. Serum secretory component (which is an equivalent of serum secretory IgA) was elevated in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic patients; patients with a liver biopsy revealing hepatitis showed the highest level. In contrast, the hepatic deposits did not contain secretory component. We conclude that the continuous deposits of IgA along liver sinusoids are not a passive reflection of changes in concentration or composition of circulating IgA, but may represent a distinct effect of alcohol on the liver related to the role of this organ in IgA metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "In less than a decade since development of echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular muscle mass, studies using this technique have provided considerable information about the prevalence and pathophysiology of left ventricular hypertrophy in human hypertension. Increased left ventricular mass has been found in a significant minority of patients with systemic hypertension, with the exact prevalence dependent both on how a population is selected and on the sex, race, and possibly age composition of its members. All published studies have reported that left ventricular hypertrophy is more closely related to blood pressure recorded in the patient's natural setting during normal activity or exercise-whether measured by portable recorder or home manometer-than to blood pressure measured by the physician. In addition, studies indicate that the classic hypertensive abnormalities of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and increased peripheral resistance are interrelated, while left ventricular hypertrophy is absent in a subgroup of patients with mild essential hypertension who exhibit high cardiac output and evidence of supernormal myocardial contractility. Conversely, the left ventricular functional response to exercise is inversely related to the degree of hypertrophy. High levels of blood viscosity, which would tend to blunt the reduction in peripheral resistance expected during sleep or exercise, have also been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with essential hypertension. Echocardiographic studies have provided evidence both for and against the hypothesis that activity of the sympathetic or reninangiotensin systems plays a direct role in causing hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. These findings demonstrate the useful role that echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular structure and function may play in hypertension research.\r"

  ".W": "Serial echocardiograms with acceptable reproducibility of measurements may be produced by careful performance and interpretation of the studies. The following recommendations have been shown to enhance reproducibility. Strict adherence to quality control is necessary to generate echocardiograms of the highest technical quality. Sonographers should be aware of the definition of a technically adequate study--including correct beam or plane angulation and continuous visualization of interfaces--and seek this ideal in every study. Participation by the sonographer in performance of measurements enhances recognition of the requirements for accurate quantitative echocardiography. Regular machine calibration is a prerequisite to accurate quantitative echocardiography. Considerable effort must be made to standardize the position of each acoustic window and angulation from which the patient is imaged--with deviation from these norms being recorded for future reference. If at all possible, measurements should be taken at end expiration. If that is not possible, measurement of several consecutive beats will limit the impact of respiratory variation. A uniform convention of measurement should be adopted. The best candidates for M-mode measurements are the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for general measurement and the Penn convention for calculation of M-mode left ventricular mass. Further data is needed to determine which approaches to two-dimensional measurements best combine accuracy and reproducibility. Interpretation of echocardiograms may be made most reproducible by measuring pertinent parameters from multiple beats and using the mean as the result and by having at least two readers interpret each echocardiogram, possibly with two separate readings by each reader.\r"

  ".W": "Because of its simplicity, widespread availability, relatively low cost, and lack of adverse effects, M-mode echocardiography has become the most widely used technique for measurement of human left ventricular mass. Necropsy comparison studies have yielded formulas for anatomically accurate estimation of left ventricular mass in patients with normally shaped ventricles using left ventricular measurements by either Penn or American Society of Echocardiography conventions, but M-mode methods are less accurate in abnormally shaped ventricles. The standard error of M-mode echocardiographic left ventricular mass measurements is approximately 40 g under difficult clinical recording conditions and 30 g or less for research studies of stable subjects. Interstudy variability of mass estimates appeared somewhat lower, resulting in 95% confidence limits for serial change up to 58 g for individual subjects and up to 10 g for study populations of 34 patients or more. The accuracy of M-mode echocardiography for measurement of left ventricular mass is similar to that of contrast angiography but may be exceeded by newer methods with greater cost or radiation exposure, including magnetic resonance imaging, cine-computed tomography, and three-dimensional echocardiographic reconstruction. Identification of left ventricular hypertrophy needs to take into account the influence of sex and body size, the variables that most influence normal ventricular mass, with provisional criteria for recognition of hypertrophy being left ventricular mass index over 134 g/m2 in men and above 110 g/m2 in women.\r"

In addition, studies using radionuclide angiography have demonstrated abnormalities in early diastolic LV filling in asymptomatic hypertensive patients with normal ejection fraction and cardiac output. Recently, Doppler recordings of flow velocity in the ascending aorta and through the mitral valve have been shown to provide useful information about LV function. To determine whether flow abnormalities could be detected in patients with mild hypertension, we recorded Doppler aortic and mitral valve flow velocities in 21 men with mild hypertension. Casual systolic blood pressure was 147 +/- 18 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) and diastolic blood pressure was 96 +/- 9 mm Hg. LV mass (310 +/- 75 g) was elevated (i.e., above the 95% normal prediction interval) in 8 of 19 patients who underwent M-mode echocardiography; LV ejection fraction was normal in all patients (mean, 80%). As in previous studies in normal subjects, we found in these hypertensive patients an inverse correlation between age and both aortic peak flow velocity (r = -0.51, p less than 0.05) and transmitral early diastolic peak flow velocity (r = -0.44, p less than 0.05) and a positive relationship between age and mitral valve late diastolic peak flow velocity (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This lung volume can be standardized from total lung capacity (TLC) if this does not change at the same time. We examined the effect of methacholine-stimulated maximal airway narrowing [change in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (delta FEV1) = 26.4%] on TLC, measured by whole-body plethysmography, in 10 normal subjects and of moderate airway narrowing (mean delta FEV1 = 34.9%) in 10 asthmatics. The TLC changed from 5.88 to 6.03 liters in normal subjects (P greater than 0.05) and from 6.92 to 6.95 liters (P greater than 0.5) in asthmatics. The results of this study suggest that TLC does not change significantly after methacholine-stimulated maximal airway narrowing in normal subjects and after moderate narrowing in asthmatics.\r"

Thirty rats (10/strain), randomly selected from highly inbred ACI, Lewis (L), and Brown Norway (BN) strains and 40 rats (20/strain) from similarly inbred Wistar-Furth (WF) and Buffalo (Buf) strains were studied. Airway responses were quantitated from changes in pulmonary resistance (RL) and airway reactivity was calculated as the dose of MCh required to increase RL to 150% (ED150RL) and 200% (ED200RL) of base line. There were no statistically significant differences in ED150RL and ED200RL among the five rat strains. Large interindividual variability was present as evidenced by 128-fold differences in ED150RL and ED200RL between the least and most sensitive animal of the same strain. In contrast, seven animals studied repeatedly on different days had values of ED150RL that differed by an average of only 2.9-fold (range 1.6-5.3). Thirteen rats that were studied on two occasions separated by an interval of 3 mo showed no systematic changes in airway reactivity. We conclude that airway reactivity to inhaled methacholine in anesthetized nose-breathing rats is not strain related, and despite animals of a given strain being genetically identical, the variability in airway reactivity within strains suggests that environmental rather than genetic factors are the major determinants of that reactivity.\r"

As shown by the sonograms, thirty-five lesions had a discrete echo pattern (usually reduced echoes and a clearly defined lesional margin) and fifteen had an ill defined pattern (similar to the pattern of the surrounding normal tissues with no definable lesional margin). Fourteen lesions were malignant and thirty-six, benign. The sonograms of all fourteen malignant lesions showed a discrete pattern, while the sonograms of the benign ones showed twenty-one discrete and fifteen ill defined patterns. Therefore, the malignant lesions produced a discrete pattern in every instance, and every lesion that produced an ill defined pattern was benign. Fourteen of the fifty lesions were cystic; of these, thirteen were benign and one was malignant. The sonograms correctly identified the cyst in seven of the thirteen benign lesions and in the one malignant cystic lesion. Based on these findings, we concluded that all palpable soft-tissue masses that appear to be discrete on a sonogram should be diagnosed without delay by examination of a specimen taken at biopsy, whereas lesions that have an ill defined appearance on a sonogram may be assumed to be benign and may safely be observed in selected patients.\r"

The other six patients (seven grafts) had an injury to the arm or forearm and were followed for an average of 30.2 months. There were four non-unions, one refracture, and no persistent infections. The final result was satisfactory in five and unsatisfactory in one patient. Fourteen of the nineteen grafts were inserted within seventeen days after the initial injury. All nine of the grafts in the hand that were inserted early did well, but three of the other five (in the arm or forearm) became infected. The method that was used in the patients who had an open injury of the hand allowed early active motion and quick rehabilitation. The exposed cortical bone was not prone to infection. The technique has limited application in patients who have an open injury of the arm or forearm because of a high incidence of complications.\r"

The mean duration of fixation with pins was 112 days. In twenty knees, arthrodesis occurred without further treatment. One knee fused after the application of dual plates, and one united after treatment with electrical stimulation. Of the remaining six patients, one had an above-the-knee amputation for persistent non-union and five had a persistent pseudarthrosis. The extent of loss of bone appeared to be the most important factor influencing union of the primary arthrodesis. One patient who had a solid union of the arthrodesis had a persistent non-union after a fracture at the site of a femoral pin. The rate of success of 68 per cent that was achieved with the device that we used is similar to the rates obtained with the use of older external fixators.\r"

  ".U": "87109382\r", 
  ".W": "The longitudinal growth of bone depends on the activities of individual chondrocytes of the growth plate. Each chondrocyte remains in a fixed location throughout its life, and there accomplishes all of its functions. Although a cell may perform several or all of its activities simultaneously, one of these will usually predominate during a particular phase of its life. The two most prominent stages are those of cellular proliferation and hypertrophy (including the mineralization of matrix) before the resorption of tissue during vascular invasion. By applying recently developed stereological procedures and improved methods for the fixation of cartilage, we compared cellular shape modulation, various ultrastructural parameters (surface areas or volumes of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi membranes, and mitochondria), the production of matrix, and cellular turnover for proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes within the proximal tibial growth plate of the rat. By the late hypertrophic stage, fourfold and tenfold increases in the mean cellular height and volume, respectively, and a threefold increase in the mean volume of the matrix per cell were achieved. The high metabolic activity of hypertrophic cells was reflected by a twofold to fivefold increase in the mean cellular surface area of rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi membranes, and the mean cellular mitochondrial volume. Rates of longitudinal growth were determined by fluorochrome labeling and incident-light fluorescence microscopy. Using these values and the stereological estimators describing cellular height, the rates of cellular turnover were calculated. The rapid progression of the vascular invasion front was found to eliminate, for each column of cells, one chondrocyte every three hours; that is, eight cells a day. The maintenance of a steady-state structure for growth-plate cartilage in rats in a steady state of growth thus necessitates efficient compensation for these losses, which is achieved by a high rate of cellular proliferation and rapid hypertrophy.\r"

To investigate the potential for phenotypic differentiation of islet cells, we prepared several clonal cell lines from a radiation-induced rat islet tumor and analyzed them for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin gene expression by cDNA hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and radioimmunoassay. We found expression of all three genes in the tumor and in the parental cell line and mixed variable phenotypes in the clonal lines derived from the parental line. We also observed the ectopic expression of the angiotensinogen gene in the tumor and the cell lines. The relative levels of hormonal gene expression differed among the cell lines but remained fixed during continuous passage. The three islet hormone mRNAs were larger compared to the pancreas owing to longer poly(A) tracts. These observations indicate that neoplastic islet cells retain the potential to differentiate into hormone-specific cellular phenotypes and may mimic developmental pathways of the pancreatic islets.\r"

Half-maximal binding occurred at a protein S concentration of 10 nM, with approximately 1,100 binding sites per platelet. The binding of protein S to platelets was followed by rapid cleavage of the protein mediated by a protease confined to the platelet membrane. The membrane protease was Ca++-dependent, inhibited by high concentrations of diisopropyl fluorophosphate, but was resistant to a variety of other protease inhibitors. Functional studies demonstrated that the cleavage of protein S was associated with complete loss of cofactor anticoagulant activity. We conclude that protein S binds to platelets and is inactivated by a novel Ca++-dependent membrane protease. This may represent a physiological reaction that regulates the activity of protein S.\r"

There were no significant differences (P greater than 0.1) between immunologic parameters measured on day 1 and day 4 in the ASA-treated group. In contrast, patients treated with ASA plus IVGG had by day 4 a highly significant decrease in HLA-Dr+ Leu 3+ helper T cells (P less than 0.001), an increase in Leu 2+ suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (P less than 0.01), and a decrease in spontaneous IgG (P less than 0.01) and IgM synthesis (P less than 0.001).

After glucagon infusion fasting glucose increased from 76 +/- 4 to 93 +/- 2 mg/dl and hepatic glucose production (HGP) rose from 1.96 +/- 0.08 to 2.25 +/- 0.08 mg/kg X min (P less than 0.001). Basal glucose oxidation after glucagon increased (P less than 0.05) and correlated inversely with decreased free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.94; P less than 0.01) and decreased lipid oxidation (r = -0.75; P less than 0.01). Suppression of HGP and stimulation of total glucose disposal were impaired at each insulin step after glucagon (P less than 0.05-0.01). The reduction in insulin-mediated glucose uptake was entirely due to diminished non-oxidative glucose utilization. Glucagon infusion also caused a decrease in basal lipid oxidation and an enhanced ability of insulin to inhibit lipid oxidation and augment lipid synthesis. These results suggest that hyperglucagonemia may contribute to the disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism in some diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the importance of the route of glucose delivery in determining net hepatic glucose balance (NHGB) eight conscious overnight-fasted dogs were given glucose via the portal or a peripheral vein. NHGB was measured using the arteriovenous difference technique during a control and two 90-min glucose infusion periods. The sequence of infusions was randomized. Insulin and glucagon were held at constant basal levels using somatostatin and intraportal insulin and glucagon infusions during the control, portal, and peripheral glucose infusion periods (7 +/- 1, 7 +/- 1, 7 +/- 1 microU/ml; 100 +/- 3, 101 +/- 6, 101 +/- 3 pg/ml, respectively). In the three periods the hepatic blood flow, glucose infusion rate, arterial glucose level, hepatic glucose load, arterial-portal glucose difference and NHGB were 37 +/- 1, 34 +/- 1, 32 +/- 3 ml/kg per min; 0 +/- 0, 4.51 +/- 0.57, 4.23 +/- 0.34 mg/kg per min; 101 +/- 5, 200 +/- 15, 217 +/- 13 mg/dl; 28.5 +/- 3.5, 57.2 +/- 6.7, 54.0 +/- 6.4 mg/kg per min; +2 +/- 1, -22 +/- 3, +4 +/- 1 mg/dl; and 2.22 +/- 0.28, -1.41 +/- 0.31, and 0.08 +/- 0.23 mg/kg per min, respectively. Thus when glucose was delivered via a peripheral vein the liver did not take up glucose but when a similar glucose load was delivered intraportally the liver took up 32% (P less than 0.01) of it. In conclusion portal glucose delivery provides a signal important for the normal hepatic-peripheral distribution of a glucose load.\r"

These studies test the hypothesis that insulin receptor (+) monocytes monitor insulin concentrations, so instructing  the T lymphocytes.

A dose-related fall in T lymphocyte insulin receptor binding was observed that was specific for the monocyte as the signalling cell and for insulin as the signal received. Monocytes from normal volunteers during a euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp were cultured with T lymphocytes and an activating stimulus. A decline in specific insulin receptor binding on T lymphocytes was observed, which Scatchard analysis demonstrated to be a consequence of reduction in receptor numbers. These studies demonstrate that the receptor (+) monocyte perceives the concentration of insulin and passes this information to T lymphocytes regulating the number of activation-induced insulin receptors. The interplay between the monocyte and T lymphocyte parallels the interaction of these cell types for recognition of antigen.\r"

DCA increased glucose-6-phosphate, an allosteric modifier of glycogen synthase, approximately 50% and increased muscle glycogen synthesis and glycogen content greater than 25%. Lactate release fell; inhibition of glycolysis accounted for greater than 80% of the decrease. This was associated with a decrease in intracellular AMP, but no change in citrate or ATP. When lactate oxidation was increased by raising extracellular lactate, glycolysis decreased (r = - 0.91), suggesting that lactate oxidation regulates glycolysis. When muscle lactate production was greatly stimulated by thermal injury, DCA increased glycogen synthesis, normalized glycogen content, and inhibited glycolysis, thereby reducing lactate release. The major effect of DCA on lactate metabolism in muscle is to inhibit glycolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin secretion is controlled by a complex set of factors that include not only glucose but amino acids, catecholamines, and intestinal hormones. We report that a novel glucagon-like peptide, co-encoded with glucagon in the glucagon gene is a potent insulinotropic factor. The glucagon gene encodes a proglucagon that contains in its sequence glucagon and additional glucagon-like peptides (GLPs). These GLPs are liberated from proglucagon in both the pancreas and intestines. GLP-I exists in at least two forms: 37 amino acids GLP-I(1-37), and 31 amino acids, GLP-I(7-37). We studied the effects of synthetic GLP-Is on insulin secretion in the isolated perfused rat pancreas. In the presence of 6.6 mM glucose, GLP-I(7-37) is a potent stimulator of insulin secretion at concentrations as low as 5 X 10(-11) M (3- to 10-fold increases over basal). GLP-I(1-37) had no effect on insulin secretion even at concentrations as high as 5 X 10(-7) M. The earlier demonstration of specific liberation of GLP-I(7-37) in the intestine and pancreas, and the magnitude of the insulinotropic effect at such low concentrations, suggest that GLP-I(7-37) participates in the physiological regulation of insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Certain aspects of the chronic complications of diabetes suggest that, with time, the abnormal metabolic milieu leads to irreversible changes in some cell populations. Since we have previously observed that high glucose concentrations induce an increase in single strand breaks in the DNA of cultured human endothelial cells, we have investigated whether the same abnormality occurs in cells derived from the in vivo diabetic environment. Peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 21 type I diabetic patients and age- and sex-matched controls were tested for rate of unwinding in alkali (a measure of DNA single strand breaks). The patients were subdivided into two groups on the basis of glycohemoglobin values above or below 9%. The group with glycohemoglobin values of 12.9 +/- 2.4% (mean +/- SD), but not the group with glycohemoglobin values of 7.4 +/- 1.5%, showed accelerated unwinding of lymphocyte DNA when compared to controls (P less than 0.01). These studies suggest that poorly controlled diabetes may result in DNA lesions, whose impact on long-term complications deserves to be investigated.\r"

All these are directed against epithelial antigens and are expressed on most malignant epithelial cells and weakly or not at all on mesothelial cells. It was hoped that these reactions would confirm diagnoses made by conventional cytology and possibly show malignant cells which had not already been identified. Of 28 patients with malignant disease (chosen to exclude any with frank ascites), eight gave positive immunochemical reactions, only four having been reported positive from conventional examination. Of 77 patients without malignant disease, HMFG-2 or E29 gave positive reactions in seven, Ca 1 or Ca 2 in two, and anti-CEA in two (reactions with plasma cells being disregarded). Some misleading reactions were probably due to endometrial cells. It was concluded that the antibodies used in this study are not sufficiently specific or sensitive to allow immunocytochemical staining to replace conventional cytological diagnosis but are a useful supplementary aid.\r"

Previous data have suggested that these patients have a high incidence of mild to moderate systemic disease, anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies, and human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3, particularly the annular form. We studied forty-nine patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus seen in local private practices in our area. Lesions of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus were seen in 34.8% of our patients. Twenty-five patients (51%) fulfilled the American Rheumatism Association criteria for the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus, and renal disease was present in nine of these patients (including 3 with decreased function). Antibodies to Ro (SS-A) and/or La (SS-B) were present in only sixteen patients, and HLA-DR3 was found in only seventeen patients. Twenty-two patients had inactive cutaneous disease at follow-up. We concluded that our patient population with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus skin lesions is less distinctive than previous literature suggests. The serologic and immunogenetic correlates were not demonstrated. The full range of lupus erythematosus-related disease was seen, although most patients follow a benign course.\r"

Eleven patients had an average of 90% clearing of actively treated lesions; 6% clearing was obtained with placebo. At 3-month follow-up examination, improvement was maintained in five patients, was maintained by at least 50% in two, and was lost in four. The five patients with remission at 3 months reported continued remission for up to an additional 8 months. This pulse dosing schedule makes topical fluorouracil under occlusion a useful, safe treatment for limited plaque psoriasis that does not respond to topical corticosteroid therapy.\r"

Langerhans cells were decreased in the region of the tumor. Many transferrin receptors were present on the tumor cells, indicating a high cellular proliferation rate. Enzyme histochemical studies of the extramammary Paget's cells showed positive reactions for several enzymes typical of sweat glands, except for leucine aminopeptidase, which was negative. A comparison with three other cases showed that these enzyme reactions varied greatly from case to case. Both immunohistochemical and enzyme histochemical findings provide further evidence that extramammary Paget's cells are related to sweat gland epithelial cells, with variable expression of cellular characteristics.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to correlate the various patterns of basement membrane zone staining by bullous pemphigoid antibodies by immunofluorescence and to correlate these patterns with the ultrastructural findings. We employed adult human skin, neonatal human foreskin, neonatal mouse skin, and rabbit cornea as substrates for electron microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence using bullous pemphigoid serum. For indirect immunofluorescence, cryosections were obtained at vertical, oblique, and horizontal planes with respect to the basement membrane zone. We show that the immunofluorescence band of basement membrane zone staining results from the coalescence of fluorescence from individual hemidesmosomes. We also show that the pattern of basement membrane zone staining depends on the ultrastructural morphology of the basement membrane zone in each tissue and on the angle of sectioning.\r"

  ".W": "The revival of the concept of coronary spasm has stimulated research into coronary artery disease. Observations in patients with variant angina have substantially contributed to the appreciation of painless myocardial ischemia. However, the presence or absence of pain during ischemic episodes is not related to the cause of ischemia, because painless ischemia can be observed in variant angina (caused by spasm), in effort-induced angina (caused by increased myocardial demand) and in myocardial infarction (caused by thrombosis). Continuous monitoring initially of patients with variant angina and subsequently of patients with unstable and stable angina proved that often painful and painless ischemic episodes are caused by a transient impairment of regional coronary blood flow rather than by an excessive increase of myocardial demand. The transient impairment of coronary flow appears to be caused by dynamic stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries. This most often occurs at the site of atherosclerotic plaques encroaching on the lumen to a variable extent. Dynamic stenosis can be caused by 1) \"physiologic\" increase of coronary tone, as in stable angina, 2) spasm, as in variant angina, and 3) thrombosis, usually in combination with \"physiologic\" changes in tone or with spasm, or both, as in unstable angina. The mechanisms of spasm, as typically observed in variant angina, are different from those of \"physiologic\" increase of tone; they appear to be related to a local alteration that makes a segment of coronary artery hyperreactive to a variety of constrictor stimuli causing only minor degrees of constriction in other coronary arteries. The nature of this abnormality, which may remain stable for months and years, is yet unknown.\r"

Although the concept of nonuniformity of the diseased heart is not new, ventricular function and the performance of the heart as a muscular pump cannot be understood unless nonuniform behavior is taken into account, even under normal conditions. Along with the loading conditions throughout the cardiac cycle and the time courses of activation and inactivation, the nonuniform behavior of load and of activation and inactivation in space and in time constitutes a third important determinant of mechanical performance and efficiency of the ventricle during both contraction and relaxation. Hence, a triad (load, activation-inactivation, nonuniformity) of controls regulates systolic function of the normal ventricle. In the diseased heart, even when loading and activation-inactivation are normal, the modulating role played by this nonuniformity can become imbalanced because of abnormal cavity size or shape or because of regional dysfunction. Such an imbalance would diminish external efficiency (the ratio of work performed to oxygen utilized) of the ventricle and result in incoordinate contraction and relaxation. These abnormalities, in turn, could exacerbate manifest cardiac failure.\r"

Although some patients responded better to one drug than the other, neither drug resulted in a clearly superior clinical response. Diltiazem was discontinued in one patient because of urticaria, but the total number of side effects was higher with nifedipine (12 of 15 patients) than with diltiazem (5 of 15, p less than 0.01). Nine patients remained symptomatic on single drug treatment and entered open label treatment with the combination of diltiazem and nifedipine. Three patients did not tolerate the combination because of important side effects; the other six also had side effects, but these were relatively minor. Four patients received no more benefit from the combination than from a single agent; the condition of two patients improved. Both diltiazem and nifedipine provide effective antianginal therapy for coronary spasm, but diltiazem has fewer side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The long-term administration of indoramin in patients (mean dose 50 mg every 12 hours) caused a mild reduction from baseline values in supine rest mean systemic blood pressure and, after dosing, elicited a significant reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and heart rate as well as a mild increase in stroke volume. Long-term indoramin therapy caused a small decrease, as compared with baseline exercise responses, in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at submaximal levels of exercise. It did not alter hemodynamic variables at maximal exercise, exercise capacity or overall clinical status, compared with findings at baseline or with placebo.\r"

BG dogs were hyperresponsive to aerosols of methacholine compared to Basenjis and greyhounds. Both BG dogs and Basenjis were allergic and had increased leukocyte cAMP phosphodiesterase activity compared to greyhounds. We concluded that the leukocyte abnormality is not associated with airway hyperresponsiveness. The leukocyte abnormality is either associated with the allergic state, with some hereditary trait that BG dogs acquired from the Basenji ancestry, or the leukocyte abnormality is necessary but not sufficient for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness.\r"

It is the change in osmolarity of the periciliary fluid that is believed to be the stimulus for bronchoconstriction. However, it is not known whether hyperosmolar and hypo-osmolar aerosols induce asthma via the same mechanism. We have previously reported that patients with asthma have a reduction in the dose of provoking agent that induces a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) for methacholine after challenge with nebulized water. To determine whether hyperosmolar aerosols also increase sensitivity to methacholine, we studied 13 subjects with asthma on 3 days. On day 1, the PD20 to methacholine was determined. On day 2, a challenge with nebulized 4.5% saline was followed by a challenge with methacholine 40 to 60 minutes later. On day 3, a challenge with nebulized water was followed by a methacholine challenge. Sensitivity to methacholine was significantly increased after water (p less than 0.02) but not after 4.5% saline. Furthermore, there was no relationship between the PD20 to water and to 4.5% saline. When the Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to compare sensitivity to the challenges, there was a significant relationship between the PD20 to 4.5% saline and methacholine (p less than 0.01) but not between the PD20 to water and methacholine. These results suggest that the mechanism of asthma induced by hyperosmolar and hypo-osmolar solutions is different.\r"

Representative body and mite culture extracts were compared by probing with individual sera, and both types of extract were also compared by RAST-inhibition studies. Extracts from the same source differed in the molecular weight (MW) of some of their IgE-binding components. In general, most IgE-binding components in culture extracts and the IS were in the 14 to 35 kd MW region, whereas extracts from mite bodies and one culture extract contained more IgE-binding components of higher MW (35 to 110 kd). Comparison of representative mite body and culture extracts by use of 22 separate sera resolved 26 and 19 IgE-binding components in the two extracts, respectively. Patterns of RAST inhibition produced by both types of extracts when they were used either as the inhibitor or as the allergosorbent demonstrated qualitative differences between the two types of extracts. These results demonstrate that mite extracts may differ considerably in their allergenic composition and emphasize the need for standardization of mite allergenic extracts and the reexamination of the suitability of the D. pteronyssinus IS.\r"

  ".W": "Hybrid resistance, which is observed in certain strain combinations when parent-strain bone marrow cells are grafted into lethally irradiated F1 hybrids, can be specifically overcome by the i.v. injection, 1 wk before the graft, of spleen cells syngeneic with the bone marrow graft. This phenomenon is due to a suppressor mechanism, induced in the spleen of the F1 hybrid by the injection of parent-strain spleen cells and mediated by a nylon-adherent Thy-1+Lyt-1+2- cell population of hybrid origin, because hybrid resistance can be inhibited by the transfer into a normal B6D2F1 of nylon-adherent Thy-1+Lyt-1+2- spleen cells from B6D2F1 mice pretreated with B6 spleen cells 1 wk earlier (B6-pretreated B6D2F1); spleen cells from B6-pretreated B6D2F1 mice not depleted of their nylon-adherent subpopulation cannot restore hybrid resistance when they are injected into a B6D2F1 rendered nonresistant by split-dose irradiation; and spleen cells from normal B6D2F1 mice cannot restore hybrid resistance when they are injected into B6-pretreated B6D2F1 hybrids. The suppressor cells specifically inhibit resistance against bone marrow cells syngeneic with the spleen cells used for pretreatment, because transfer of nylon-adherent B6-pretreated B6D2F1 spleen cells into a normal B6D2F1 does not enhance syngeneic B6D2F1 or parent-strain D2 bone marrow growth, and when injected into normal B6D2F1 hybrids, nylon-adherent spleen cells from B6D2F1 mice pretreated with D2 spleen cells 1 wk earlier (D2-pretreated B6D2F1) are not able to transfer the inhibition of hybrid resistance against B6 bone marrow cells. Moreover, the activity of the suppressor cells depends on the genetic environment of the hybrid host mice, because nylon-adherent B6-pretreated B6D2F1 spleen cells injected into normal B6C3F1 hybrids do not transfer an inhibition of hybrid resistance, and when injected into B6C3F1 hosts previously rendered nonresistant by split-dose irradiation, spleen cells from B6-pretreated B6D2F1 mice can, in contrast, transfer hybrid resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cells play an essential role in immune responses by regulating the entry of leukocytes into lymphoid tissues and sites of inflammation. As an initial approach to analyzing endothelial cell specialization in relation to such immune function, we have produced monoclonal antibodies (MAB) against mouse lymph node endothelium. Three antibodies were selected: MECA-20, recognizing the endothelium of all blood vessels in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid organs; MECA-217, which stains the endothelium lining large elastic arteries, but among small vessels is specific for post-capillary venules within lymphoid organs and tissues exposed to exogenous antigen, such as skin and uterus; and MECA-325, an antibody that demonstrates specificity for the specialized high endothelial venules (HEV) that control lymphocyte homing into lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. MECA-325 failed to stain vessels in any non-lymphoid organs tested. Immunoperoxidase studies of HEV in lymph node frozen sections, and of isolated high endothelial cells in suspensions, demonstrated that the antigens recognized by all three antibodies are expressed at the cell surface; those defined by MECA-20 and MECA-325 are also present in the cytoplasm. To study the regulation of the antigens defined by these MAB in relation to extra-lymphoid immune reactions, we assessed their expression in induced s.c. granulomas as a model for chronic inflammation. Small vessels in the granulomas were already stained by MECA-217 in the first days of development. In contrast MECA-325 detected postcapillary venules (which frequently displayed the morphologic characteristics of HEV) only from approximately 1 wk, in parallel with the development of a persistent mononuclear cell infiltrate including numerous lymphocytes. The selective appearance of the MECA-325 antigen on vascular endothelium supporting lymphocyte traffic in both lymphoid and extra-lymphoid sites suggests that this antigen may play an important role in the process of lymphocyte extravasation. The demonstration of lymphoid organ- and inflammation-specific microvascular antigens offers direct evidence for a complex specialization of endothelium in relation to immune stimuli, and supports the concept that microvascular differentiation may play an important role in local immune responses.\r"

  ".U": "87110602\r", 
  ".W": "We demonstrated previously that B151K12 T cell hybridoma produces two distinct B cell differentiation factors, B151-TRF1 and B151-TRF2, capable of inducing differentiation of antigen-activated and unstimulated B cells into antibody-forming cells, respectively. In the present study we investigated the pathophysiologic relation of these factors with factors obtained from MRL/MP-lpr/lpr(MRL/lpr) mice and (C57BL/6 X DBA/2)F1 (BDF1) mice undergoing chronic graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR), representing a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus with polyclonal B cell activation associated with the T cell hyperfunction. The functional and biochemical analyses revealed that B151-TRF2-like, but not B151-TRF1-like, activity was found in culture fluid supernatant (CFS) of lymphoid cells from MRL/lpr mice with lymphoproliferative syndrome. On the other hand, both B151-TRF1- and B151-TRF2-like activities were detected in CFS prepared from spleen cells of BDF1 mice undergoing chronic GVHR by the inoculation of parental DBA/2 spleen cells. Interestingly, spleen cells of BDF1 mice transferred with DBA/2 thymocytes preferentially elaborated B151-TRF1-like factor. Because BDF1 mice transferred with DBA/2 spleen cells but not with DBA/2 thymocytes developed a SLE-like syndrome exemplified by the appearance of Coombs' antibody and proteinuria, it seemed likely that production of B151-TRF2-like factor was closely associated with the onset of autoimmune disease. In fact, B151-CFS containing B151-TRF2 but not B151-TRF1 activity could induce a striking autoantibody production both in vivo and in vitro as detected by PFC responses of normal mice to bromelain-treated mouse red blood cells (BrMRBC). Moreover, it was demonstrated that in vitro anti-BrMRBC PFC responses induced by semipurified B151-TRF2 was markedly inhibited by addition of relevant anti-Ia antibody to the culture. Thus, the present study demonstrates that B151-TRF2 represents one of the B cell differentiation factors responsible for polyclonal B cell activation leading to autoantibody production.\r"

One MAb (7H10) reacted with a conformational epitope probably formed as a result of the interaction of gp45 with a nonglycosylated 45-kDa product (p45). Three other MAb (3D3, 7B11, and 7B2) reacted with different epitopes on a nonglycosylated 83-kDa product (p83), shown by differences in their reactivities against various parasite isolates in immunofluorescent antibody assays. Immunoprecipitation of antigens that were pulse-labeled with [3H]isoleucine and chased with cold isoleucine showed that p45 and gp45 were processed products of gp195 and p83 was sequentially processed into smaller fragments of 73 and 67 kDa (p73 and p67). Immunoblots showed that the 7B11 and 7B2 epitopes were present on p83, p73, and p67, but that the 3D3 epitope was present only on p83 and p73. A two-site immunoassay showed the 3D3 epitope to be repetitive. The 3D3 and 7B11 epitopes were serotype restricted (present in seven and 24 of 33 isolates, respectively), but the other five epitopes were common to all isolates tested. The gp195 and its processed products have Mr that are consistent with the Mr of a number of antigens shown previously to be associated with the immune complexes that are formed when merozoites are agglutinated by antibodies contained in some growth inhibitory immune sera.\r"

On the basis of their distinct patterns of response to a panel of different T. cruzi strains, clones recognizing strain-specific, shared, or common determinants were identified. Functional studies indicated that ST1 and some but not all of the clones are capable of expressing antigen-specific T helper function in vitro and in vivo. In addition, co-incubation of T. cruzi-specific T cells with cultured T. cruzi-infected syngeneic macrophages led to the dose-dependent destruction of intracellular parasites. Most notably, ST1 and several of the cloned T. cruzi-specific T cell lines were able to passively protect syngeneic recipients from lethal T. cruzi challenge infection. Efforts to identify the parasite antigens recognized by these T cell lines, particularly the protective clones, are currently in progress.\r"

  ".U": "87110623\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work has shown that IgG rheumatoid factors (RF) bind to the C gamma 2-C gamma 3 interface region of human IgG in the same area that binds staphylococcal protein A (SPA). Group A, C, and G strains of Streptococci possess Fc receptors that bind to IgG but not to fragments containing only the C gamma 2 or C gamma 3 domains. This work describes the binding site location on human IgG for the binding of the isolated Fc receptor from the T15 strain of a Group A streptococcus and its relationship to the site that binds SPA and the IgG RF. The isolated T15 Fc receptor (T15) with a molecular mass of 29.5 kD inhibited the binding of IgG RF to IgG. The binding of T15 itself to IgG was strongly inhibited by SPA (42.0 kD) and its monovalent fragment D (7 kD). Human IgG fragments consisting of the C gamma 3 domains did not inhibit the binding of T15 to IgG, whereas those with both domains were effective inhibitors. T15 did not bind to rabbit IgG fragments consisting of either the C gamma 2 or C gamma 3 domains, but did bind to those with both domains. An IgG3 myeloma protein was a poor inhibitor and has been shown to bind poorly to the IgG RF. Most IgG3 myeloma proteins did not bind to SPA. The substitution of Arg and Phe for His 435 and Tyr 436 is responsible for the poor binding of IgG3 to SPA and to the IgG RF. Chemical modification of His or Tyr on IgG reduced its ability to inhibit the binding of T15 to IgG. Reversal of the chemical modifications with hydroxylamine resulted in near complete restoration of inhibitory capacity. This information, collectively, coupled with the known positions in space of the His and Tyr residues in the C gamma 2-C gamma 3 interface region, verified that both His 435 and Tyr 436, and possibly His 310 and 433, are involved. These residues are also involved in binding SPA and the IgG RF. These data therefore indicate that the T15 Group A Streptococcal Fc receptor binds to the same location on the Fc of IgG as SPA and the IgG RF. The biologic relevance of these similarities between bacterial cell wall Fc receptors and IgG RF are not yet apparent, but suggest that RF could bear the internal image of these bacterial structures.\r"

  ".U": "87110636\r", 
  ".W": "As previously shown, three distinct phenotypes exist in murine natural killer (NK) cell activity when it is evaluated by the endogenous levels of activity and the susceptibility to augmentation by interferon (IFN) and IFN inducers. The \"low\" phenotype has low levels of activity which can be poorly augmented by IFN, as in mice of SJL strain. The \"inducible\" phenotype exhibits low endogenous levels but can vigorously respond to IFN-mediated augmentation, as in A.SW strain. The \"high\" NK phenotype shows high levels of endogenous activity which can be augmented to still higher levels by IFN, as in B10.S mice. Since SJL mice with congenital absence of the thymus (nude) were of the inducible type, the effect of neonatal thymectomy was examined in the present study. Neonatal thymectomy was found to convert the low phenotype of SJL mice to the inducible, mimicking the effect of nu/nu genotype. Thymectomy as late as 25 days after birth was effective, but retransplantation of a syngeneic newborn or adult thymus, or thymocytes, failed to reverse the effect of thymectomy. The poor responsiveness of NK activity to IFN in SJL, therefore, is extrinsic to the NK cell lineage and is attributable to suppression or maturational block of NK cell differentiation by the thymus during the first few weeks of neonatal life. A series of experiments with bone marrow chimeras showed that the SJL recipients did not allow the expression of inducible or high phenotype by bone marrow progenitors from allogeneic donors with either phenotype. Therefore, the SJL recipients provide an environment which suppresses not only the development of IFN-sensitive NK cell precursors, but also the levels of endogenous NK cell activity. SJL bone marrow cells gave rise to NK activity of inducible phenotype in B10.S recipients, confirming the crucial role of the environment in which NK cell differentiation takes place.\r"

To this purpose, cDNA sequences corresponding to the exact NH2-terminus and amino acid sequence of mature, monocyte-derived human IL 1 beta were placed under control of the inducible trp-lac (TAC) fusion promoter and were expressed in E. coli strain JM105. rIL 1 beta was purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Yields of 10 to 20 mg of rIL 1 beta/liter/10(11) cells were obtained. Purified rIL 1 beta was then compared in a number of biochemical and biologic assays to purified native IL 1 beta. Native and rIL 1 beta co-migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as 17.5 kd polypeptides and reacted with specific polyclonal antisera raised to three synthetic peptides of human IL 1 beta in immunoblot experiments. Amino acid sequence analysis of rIL 1 beta showed that the native amino terminus, an ALA residue, was faithfully maintained. Purified native and rIL 1 beta co-chromatographed on reverse-phase HPLC. Specific biologic activities of rIL 1 beta were indistinguishable from those of the native protein in murine thymocyte and human dermal fibroblast proliferation assays, with half-maximal stimulation occurring at concentrations of 25 pM in the murine thymocyte assay and 2 pM in the human dermal fibroblast assay. Similarly, native and rIL 1 beta competed equally well for high affinity IL 1 receptor binding sites, each exhibiting a Ki of 20 pM on MRC-5 human embryonic lung fibroblasts. These observations indicate that E. coli efficiently expresses large quantities of rIL 1 beta, which emulates exactly the properties of the native protein.\r"

TAF is biochemically distinct from IL 1, IL 2, IL 3, and other colony stimulating factors, IL 4 (BSF-1) and interferons. Furthermore, of the recombinant and natural cytokines tested, only IL 2 and TAF are active in the TAF assay. In the presence of Con A, TAF stimulates an increase in the steady-state level of IL 2 mRNA in T cells, the secretion of active IL 2 into the culture medium, and the proliferation of the T cells. We propose that TAF is a previously undescribed molecule the function of which is to stimulate IL 2 production by T cells that have encountered antigen, and we propose that TAF has an important role in primary T cell immune responses.\r"

A monoclonal antibody HC-10, directed against free B-locus heavy chain, was the only reagent capable of efficiently detecting the HLA-B27 heavy chains in detergent lysates. These heavy chains were devoid of sialic acid. Trace amounts of HLA-B27 could be isolated with the anti-HLA-A,-B antibody W6/32, which reacts with the heavy chain beta 2-microglobulin complex. In marked contrast, HLA-A2 and -B7 genes, when transfected, yielded easily detectable amounts of antigen precipitable with W6/32, which carried the usual complement of sialic acids. Because the alpha 3 domains of HLA-B27 and HLA-B7 and the more COOH-terminal portions are identical in amino acid sequence, structural elements in the polymorphic alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains must control association of heavy chain with beta 2-microglobulin. Introduction of a human beta 2-microglobulin gene into L cells transfected with the HLA-B27 gene rescued the expression of HLA-B27 at the cell surface, as evidenced by reactivity with W6/32, surface staining, and the presence of sialic acid on the heavy chain.\r"

  ".W": "A previous report from our laboratory indicated that a proteinase inhibitor is produced by rabbit T lymphocytes. We now report that a human T cell line, C91/PL, produces a proteinase inhibitor which inhibits the enzymatic activity of trypsin and kallikrein. This newly identified proteinase inhibitor (LPI 1) did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of four other serine proteinases (thrombin, plasmin, chymotrypsin, or pancreatic elastase), a thiol proteinase (papain), or a carboxyl proteinase (pepsin). Active synthesis of LPI 1 by the C91/PL cell line was shown by the appearance of similar levels of inhibitory activity in sequential cell supernatants, lack of appearance of inhibitor in supernatants of cells killed by heat or sodium azide or of viable cells in the presence of cyclohexamide, and incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid into newly synthesized inhibitor. Although both the inhibitor of rabbit origin and of human origin are proteins produced by T cells and have similar inhibitory specificity, important differences were observed: LPI 1 is sensitive to boiling and the two inhibitors migrate differently upon electrophoresis in substrate-containing polyacrylamide gel. Furthermore, LPI 1 was produced by a cell line of the T4 phenotype which had been established by in vitro viral transformation of human cord blood lymphocytes with HTLV 1 whereas the inhibitor of rabbit origin was produced by normal splenic T cells. Three other human T cell lines of the T4 phenotype, MOLT-13, KE-37, and HPB-ALL, from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia did not produce a proteinase inhibitor. Thus, the production of proteinase inhibitors does not appear to be a general characteristic of human T cell lines nor of the T4 subset. Proteinase inhibitors produced by T cells may have an immunoregulatory role in proteinase-mediated physiological processes.\r"

The amount of parasite DNA was measured in the livers of Norway Brown rats at the peak of proliferation of the exoerythrocytic forms (EEF). In vitro treatment of 1.5 X 10(5) sporozoites with 0.36 microgram/0.5 ml of whole 3D11 IgG neutralized about 90% of the sporozoite infectivity. When the dose was 3.6 micrograms no signal was detected, indicating that less than ten sporozoites developed into EEF in the liver. In contrast, 3.6 micrograms of Fab obtained from 3D11 neutralized sporozoite infectivity by only 60%. Although the neutralizing effect of 3D11 was very marked, the infected rats developed parasitemias after a prolonged delay in patency, suggesting that a small proportion of sporozoites was resistant to the effects of 3D11. The sporozoites were subjected to four cycles of 3D11-mediated selection, each one involving treatment of sporozoites with the antibodies, injection of the mixture into rats, infection of hamsters with blood stage parasites obtained from the rats, feeding of Anopheles stephensi on these hamsters, and obtaining sporozoites from the salivary glands of the infected mosquitoes. After four cycles of selection, the susceptibility of the resulting sporozoites to different concentrations of 3D11 was compared with that of nonselected sporozoites. No differences were detected, indicating that the capacity of a few sporozoites to escape the neutralizing effect of 3D11 antibodies is not inherited.\r"

The deletions appear to be identical in all of the independent clones, and extend an unknown distance upstream of the B2m gene from a region in the first intron. Southern blot analysis with the use of oligonucleotides to the wild type gene sequence mapped the breakpoint to within 39 base pairs. The high frequency of independent spontaneous mutants showing indistinguishable deletions suggests that the first intron of the B2m gene contains sequences that are highly susceptible to site-specific recombinations.\r"

To investigate these initial events in the CTL-target interaction, we used HLA-A2- and HLA-B7-specific human CTL clones and HLA-typed B lymphoblastoid target cells. By using two different adhesion assays, we demonstrated antigen nonspecific CTL-target cell adhesion. To more precisely define the contribution of the antigen-specific receptor to CTL-target cell adhesion, we used the HLA-A2, HLA-B7, and mock transfected RD target cells. Consistent with the results when using B lymphoblastoid target cells, the CTL clones demonstrated equivalent adhesions to the RD target cells whether or not they expressed HLA-A2 or HLA-B7. These results suggested that CTL-target cell adhesion occurred independent of the T cell receptor. By using the calcium-sensitive dye Indo-1 and flow cytometry, we assessed CTL-target cell adhesion and CTL activation. Simultaneous measurement of adhesion and intracellular free calcium demonstrated that CTL-target cell adhesion alone did not activate CTL clones. Both CTL-target cell adhesion and the presence of the appropriate HLA target molecule were necessary for the efficient activation of human CTL. MAb inhibition studies indicated that antigen nonspecific adhesion is largely regulated by the LFA-1, CD2 (LFA-2/T11), and LFA-3 cell surface molecules. These antigen nonspecific cell-cell interaction molecules appear to play an important role in facilitating antigen recognition and subsequent target cell lysis.\r"

Extended culture of CTL in high concentrations of interleukin 2 induces promiscuous lytic activity in which state both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant target cells are lysed. Cold-target competition analysis showed that the development of NK activity was associated with the acquisition of binding activity for NK-sensitive but not for NK-resistant targets, whereas the development of promiscuous lytic activity was associated with the acquisition of binding activity for both types of target. Antigen-specific cytolysis was inhibited by antibodies to Ly-2, Ly-5, LFA-1 and to the V region of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), whereas NK and promiscuous lytic activity in the same cells was resistant to inhibition by anti-Ly-2 and anti-TCR. NK activity was expressed normally against a variant NK-sensitive cell line lacking all MHC antigens. These results show that, in contrast to antigen-specific recognition, the NK and promiscuous lytic activities of CTL are expressed without participation of effector cell Ly-2 and TCR molecules or target cell MHC molecules, and are most likely mediated through novel and distinct receptor systems.\r"

We have linked continuous expression to BCG resistance by using C.D2Ityr mice, which are congenic with BCG-susceptible BALB/c mice except for genes on a portion of chromosome 1, which contains the gene(s) for BCG resistance. Macrophages from C.D2Ityr mice continuously expressed I-A, whereas macrophages from BALB/c mice transiently expressed I-A. Continuous expression by macrophages from both Bcgr and Bcgs mice could be induced in vitro with rIFN-gamma. However, the continuous expression of I-A by macrophages from Bcgs mice required the continued presence of IFN-gamma, whereas that by Bcgr macrophages did not. The continuous expression of I-A by macrophages from Bcgs mice was also inhibited by hydrocortisone, cyclohexamide, tunicamycin, and monensin, whereas I-A expression by Bcgr macrophages was not affected. The continuous expression of I-A by macrophages from Bcgr mice did not require its continued synthesis. The significance of these findings to the induction of immunity and to antimicrobial resistance are discussed.\r"

Definitive studies on NTA's role in the induction of SLE, however, have been lacking due to the lack of a pure source of NTA. Although it is clear that NTA are a heterogeneous group of antibodies, the nature of their antigens has remained obscure. We report the characteristics of a monoclonal NTA, designated SAG-3, which appears more reflective of the activities previously reported of serum NTA than other NTA-secreting clones. SAG-3 is an IgM autoantibody cytotoxic for 80 to 90% of thymocytes, 20 to 25% of splenic lymphocytes, 25 to 30% of lymph node cells, and less than 3% cortisol-resistant thymocytes, bone marrow, and fetal liver cells. SAG-3 is murine-specific without reactivity towards rat, hamster, or guinea pig, and appears very early in thymic development, on day 17 fetal thymocytes. SAG-3 is equally cytotoxic against several strains of mice, including both Thy-1.1 and Thy-1.2 allotypes, and the cytotoxicity is absorbed by brain but not liver cells. Reactive thymocytes occurred throughout the cortical regions of the thymus, indicating preferential affinity towards immature thymocytes. Although the serologic activities of SAG-3 suggest that Thy-1 alloantigen is its target, SAG-3 antigen is found to be distinct from Thy-1 and also from Lyt-1, Lyt-2, or L3T4 antigens. The binding of SAG-3 to thymocytes could be competitively inhibited by NTA-positive NZB sera.\r"

  ".W": "A Leishmania mexicana amazonensis promastigote membrane glycoprotein (Mr 46,000) expressing the species-specific and promastigote-specific epitope of monoclonal antibody IX 2H7-E10(M-2) has been purified to homogeneity, and studies have been made to determine the minimum peptide fragment that retained antigenic activity. Peptide mapping experiments performed with the metabolically labeled or surface radioiodinated protein illustrated its highly folded nature and marked resistance to proteolytic digestion. The M-2 epitope was readily destroyed by limited proteolysis and/or reduction and alkylation, indicating disulfide bond involvement in its formation by at least the secondary protein structure. The stability of approximately half of the molecular mass of the protein (46kDa/M-2) was also dependent on disulfide bonding. Enzymic digests under various conditions generated a glycopolypeptide (Mr 22,000 to 27,000), extremely resistant to further enzymic digestion, that was the dominant immunogenic portion of the purified protein recognized by a specific rabbit heteroserum. No smaller or larger fragments were antigenic. Data obtained by using the radioiodinated hydrophobic probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-([m-125]iodophenyl)-diazirine ([125I]TID) indicate that 46kDa/M-2 is an integral membrane protein with a component polypeptide (Mr 23,000 to 27,000), highly resistant to further enzymic cleavage and containing sequences within the external promastigote membrane. Data indicate that the [125I]TID-labeled fragment is identical to the immunodominant fragment. We suggest that hydrophobic interactions maintain the integrity of this fragment as amino acids within it fold through the parasite membrane.\r"

The patterns of antigen reactivity were compared by using sera from individuals with Ldc, Leishmania mexicana amazonensis (Lma), Trypanosoma cruzi, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or Mycobacterium leprae infections. Sera from individuals with these infections recognized Ldc antigens in several m.w. ranges. Reactivity was due to recognition of Ldc molecules and not to Ldc culture medium components, as shown by comparing Ldc promastigotes grown in the presence or absence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), by immunoblotting of FBS, and by [35S]methionine labeling. The major findings of the study were as follows. Immunoblots with Ldc promastigotes could be used to distinguish individuals with Ldc infections from those with Lma infections. Persons with Ldc infections had antibodies to a Ldc antigen of approximately 32 to 35 kd not recognized by persons with Lma infections. Individuals cured of acute Ldc infection did not develop antibodies that differed in specificity to those present during their acute phase of infection. Ldc antigens in the 62 to 66 kd region were recognized by all individuals with Ldc or Lma infections but were not recognized by individuals in the other disease groups or by control sera. This region was found to contain at least four distinct bands, one of which appeared to be glycosylated as indicated by periodic acid-Schiff staining and concanavalin A labeling; an apparently nonglycosylated protein of 62 to 63 kd was eluted from SDS-PAGE gels and was used to diagnose Ldc infection by the ELISA. Whereas crude Ldc antigen gave false positive results with T. cruzi and mycobacteria infection sera, the eluted 62 to 63 kd protein was 100% specific and sensitive in the diagnosis of Ldc infection.\r"

Other antibodies to matrix molecules (bullous pemphigoid antigen, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen, and laminin) showed excellent staining of both the dermal-epidermal junction and dermal blood vessels in both neonatal foreskin and adult skin. Further, the ultrastructural appearance of the substrates appeared identical. The implication is that neonatal foreskin is not a good substrate to use for the routine screening of monoclonal antibodies to matrix components by indirect immunofluorescence since a \"false negative\" evaluation may occur.\r"

Bullous pemphigoid and PV lesions contain significantly greater numbers of T lymphocytes (p less than 0.001), including both T helper/inducer and T cytotoxic/suppressor subsets, macrophages (p less than 0.002), and Langerhans cells (p less than 0.01), than NS or lesions of DH, supporting the concept that cell-mediated immunity is involved in bulla formation and autoantigen presentation in BP and PV.

Thrombospondin is subdivided into functional domains which bind specifically to heparin, fibronectin, collagen, and to specific cellular receptors. It is found within the basement membranes of kidney, lung, smooth muscle, and skin. Thus TSP may serve as an important link between cells and matrices. Thrombospondin also has been reported at the epidermal-dermal junction. We wished to determine whether human keratinocytes synthesize and secrete TSP. Pure human keratinocytes were grown in defined medium without fibroblast feeder layers. Immunofluorescent staining with either rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies to human platelet TSP yielded specific granular staining within the cytoplasm of keratinocytes. Culture media and cellular lysates were harvested from cultures metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and autoradiography revealed a major labeled band comigrating with purified platelet TSP in both the media and the cellular lysates. Immunoprecipitation with either the polyclonal or the monoclonal anti-TSP antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography identified this band as TSP. Thus keratinocytes in culture synthesize and secrete TSP. Thrombospondin may play an important role in epidermal interactions with extracellular matrix.\r"

Culture-positive episodes of herpes took significantly longer to heal than did the others. Lesions in men were larger and lasted longer but were less symptomatic than those in women. Foscarnet did not statistically improve the times to healing or the loss of symptoms overall but did result in a higher proportion of symptom-free individuals after one day of treatment. Foscarnet-treated patients had a reduced duration of shedding of virus, and this was significant for men. These clinical benefits do not, however, warrant general use of this agent for established lesions. Earlier, prodromal treatment might have been more effective, but patient-initiated studies include a greater proportion of culture-negative (shorter) episodes that often make results difficult to interpret.\r"

We studied the acute disposition and toxicity of intravenous (iv), intramuscular (im), subcutaneous (sc), and oral chloroquine in 60 adult Zambian patients hospitalized with falciparum malaria. Plasma concentration profiles after parenteral administration were characterized by wide fluctuations between peak and trough values. Absorption of im and sc chloroquine was rapid, with a median time to peak concentration of 30 min and a peak plasma concentration five times higher than after oral administration. The pharmacokinetic data suggest that the acute toxicity of parenteral chloroquine is related to transiently high concentrations in blood and result from incomplete distribution out of a relatively small central compartment. Parenteral chloroquine may be administered safely by simply giving smaller, more-frequent doses than are currently used or, in the case of iv administration, by using continuous infusion.\r"

Although antibody to bacterial hyaluronidase was detected in all Streptococcus-infected groups, antibody to M 49 streptococcal bacteriophage hyaluronidase usually was found in only M 49 streptococci-infected patients. Although the greatest IgG and IgM antibody response to bacteriophage hyaluronidase can be demonstrated in individuals with glomerulonephritis, the antibody response does not indicate a direct relation of lysogeny and nephritis because subjects with and without nephritis after M 49 streptococcal infection all had a significant rise in antibody titer.\r"

Using a previously identified Nocardia asteroides-specific protein, we developed an enzyme immunoassay for the rapid diagnosis of nocardiosis. We evaluated sera from 22 patients with nocardiosis, 83 hospitalized controls, and 21 patients with tuberculosis. Twenty (91%) of the sera from patients with nocardiosis had titers of antibody greater than or equal to 1:256, whereas all of the sera from controls and from patients with tuberculosis had titers less than 1:256. This assay represents a highly sensitive and specific serodiagnostic tool for evaluating patients with possible nocardiosis.\r"

Japanese encephalitis accounts for 20,000 acute illnesses per year, and measles encephalomyelitis accounts for as many as 100,000. Both are accompanied by mortalities of 20%-30%, and in both forms, approximately one-half of the survivors have neurological sequelae. Therefore, these two diseases are responsible for a considerable proportion of worldwide mental and motor disabilities. Furthermore, both diseases are preventable with use of safe vaccines. Despite these similarities, their very different pathologies appear to be based on different mechanisms of pathogenesis (table 2). In Japanese encephalitis there is direct invasion of the virus into the nervous system, selective infection and destruction of neurons, and evidence that both humoral and cellular immune responses attenuate the infection. In measles encephalomyelitis there is little evidence that the virus invades the nervous system. Rather, measles virus infects lymphoid cells and causes abnormalities in immune regulation. Humoral immune responses are not found within the nervous system, and the cellular immune response may be inappropriately directed against host antigens. In measles encephalomyelitis, the inflammatory cells entering the nervous system may be the effector cells of autoimmune disease.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable information has recently emerged regarding certain \"groups\" of novel viruses associated with gastroenteritis in humans. The viruses reviewed here are 20-35 nm in diameter and can be detected in the stools of acutely ill individuals with gastroenteritis. These viruses can be conveniently divided into four \"groups\": Norwalk-like agents, caliciviruses, astroviruses, and other small round viruses. The evidence for the etiologic association of these agents with gastroenteritis varies from agent to agent but is most extensive for the Norwalk-like agents, of which the Norwalk serotype is a major cause of epidemic gastroenteritis. Human caliciviruses appear to be relatively common causes of gastroenteritis in children, particularly in Japan and the United Kingdom. Astroviruses have been reported as occasional causes of gastroenteritis in children and adults in various parts of the world. The epidemiological significance of the other small round viruses is unknown. Because of the difficulty of cultivating these agents in vitro, biochemical and antigenic characterization of these agents is incomplete. An understanding of the pathogenesis of disease and of the roles of immune responses to infection is similarly at a primitive stage. The recent development of sensitive and efficient assays for detection of several of these agents and the reports that certain strains of human caliciviruses and astroviruses can be cultivated in vitro should facilitate characterization and epidemiological studies of these agents. Systematic, prospective epidemiological studies of these agents in well-defined populations of various age groups are sorely needed for definition of the relative importance of each agent in human disease. Such information is essential for the consideration of appropriate control measures.\r"

Besides manifesting distinct clinical patterns, these categories of E. coli differ in their epidemiology and pathogenesis and in their O:H serotypes. Common features (albeit distinct for each category) include plasmid-encoded virulence properties, characteristic interactions with intestinal mucosa, and elaboration of various types of enterotoxins or cytotoxins. A less-well-defined fifth category of diarrheagenic E. coli is that of enteroadherent E. coli, so far identifiable only by their pattern of adherence to Hep-2 cells in tissue culture.\r"

  ".W": "This has been an analysis of a number of agents whose clinical use has been approved in the past five years and of several agents that will undoubtedly be available within the next year. By the very nature of time alotted, the analysis had to be superficial. I believe that it is important to view all the agents because they cross each other in uses. I believe that areas of appropriate use exist for all of the compounds that I have discussed, and I also believe that cost and convenience will play increasingly important roles in the selection of what agent is most fitting, the definition of appropriate. In many infections it will not be possible to show a significant difference among drugs in a class, unless extremely large studies are undertaken. From my review of the literature in preparation for this meeting, I doubt these studies will be mounted. The infectious disease clinician must be familiar with all of the agents so that he or she can make judgments about which agent(s) make(s) the most sense for his/her hospital. I believe that it is fitting and proper for the infectious disease physician to appropriate the correct selection, methods of administration, and dose of antibiotic in many clinical situations, particularly ones in which parenteral agents are used. I hope the IDSA will have an impact on the proper use of the quinolones, monobactams, penems, and carbapenems. Our goal in the use of antimicrobial agents should be the selection of agents for prophylaxis, empiric therapy, and therapy for defined infections in a manner that results in cure, with reasonable cost and minimal damage to the microbial ecology.\r"

To explore this issue further, we conducted a study of the evolution of shock in three Lassa virus-infected rhesus monkeys. By the sixth day after infection, a marked, progressive reduction of in vitro platelet aggregation occurred despite normal numbers of circulating platelets and a normal platelet survival time and was accompanied by loss of prostacyclin production by postmortem endothelium. Both of these functions recovered rapidly in a surviving animal. There was no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, nor were clotting factors significantly abnormal. We observed association of viral antigen with neutrophils and progressive neutrophilia. Viremia was not reduced by a brisk antibody response in our animals, and there was a general depression of response to mitogens in mixed lymphocyte stimulation assays. Our findings suggest that shock in Lassa fever is due to biochemical dysfunctions of platelets and endothelial cells and results from loss of intravascular plasma volume, effusions, and hemorrhage.\r"

Cytological and immunologic results were closely related except in one BAL. In five BALs, a positive culture for virus was the sole criterion noted for diagnosis of CMV. The patients with both cytologically and immunologically positive results were more likely to die with or from respiratory failure (P less than .05), diffuse interstitial patterns (P less than .01), and severe acute graft-vs.-host disease (P less than .02) than were the patients without any criterion for diagnosis of CMV.

Compared with culture for virus, the hybridization assay had a sensitivity of 90.6% and a specificity of 77.8%. The quantity of HCMV DNA and the infectivity titer were directly correlated. Quantitation of HCMV DNA by hybridization was more reproducible than were infectivity titers for frozen specimens. Histopathologic examination of lung specimens detected HCMV inclusions in 60% (15 of 25) of patients with HCMV-associated interstitial pneumonia, whereas hybridization results were positive for 96% (24 of 25) of these patients. A significant inverse correlation was demonstrated between quantitative values for HCMV DNA and the duration of pneumonia.\r"

Papain digestion for selective cleavage of IgG1 and IgG3 yielded an IgG2-rich pool that contained 31% of the initial IgG but 69% of the antibody to III-GBS. This pool retained opsonophagocytic activity of antibody to III-GBS at levels similar to that for the initial IgG pool. Analysis of F(ab')2 fragments of pepsin-digested IgG revealed that the level of alternative pathway-mediated opsonophagocytosis of III-GBS was similar to that mediating functional activity in the initial IgG preparation. Therefore, IgG2 is an active opsonin for III-GBS, but divalency appears to be required for alternative pathway-mediated opsonophagocytosis.\r"

The gene encoding the 11-kDa protein was subcloned in a 2.1-kilobase fragment and shown to mediate serum resistance in both E. coli K12 and a cryptic plasmid-free (serum-sensitive) strain of S. typhimurium. The cryptic plasmid-free S. typhimurium strain did not express normal lipopolysaccharide, but introduction of the 11-kDa protein gene into the strain rendered the strain serum resistant without restoration of normal lipopolysaccharide synthesis. The 11-kDa protein gene was not sufficient to restore either macrophage resistance or virulence to a cryptic plasmid-free strain of S. typhimurium.\r"

Within 12 days of initiation of human insulin for gestational diabetes, large local reactions developed in the patient in association with high levels of IgE to human insulin. As the local reactions subsided, the levels of IgE to human insulin decreased. The patient's insulin requirement was unusually high for pregnancy and tended to decrease in parallel with falling levels of IgG to human insulin, suggesting an element of immunologic insulin resistance. In addition to IgE and IgG against human insulin, we were able to demonstrate the presence of IgE and IgG against porcine and bovine insulin in the serum samples of this patient. The patient had similar immediate cutaneous reactivity to each insulin. In inhibition studies, similar amounts of porcine insulin, bovine insulin, or human insulin were found to produce 50% inhibition of human insulin binding to IgE or IgG against human insulin. Excess porcine insulin or bovine insulin resulted in total inhibition of human insulin binding to IgE or IgG. Thus even in a patient whose initial form of insulin therapy was human insulin, there was development of insulin allergy and of IgG to human insulin that may have contributed to insulin resistance. Moreover, the antigenic determinants recognized by antibody induced by human insulin may also be present on bovine insulin and porcine insulin as demonstrated in this case.\r"

Our study was performed to determine whether the changes in plasma aldosterone level observed during hemodialysis are modulated by changes in corticosterone methyloxidase II activity. We measured plasma levels of adrenal zona glomerulosa steroids, for example, aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone (18-OH-B), immediately before and after 4 hours of hemodialysis (n = 8). Plasma levels of steroids originating from the adrenal zona fasciculata, for example, cortisol, corticosterone, 18-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone, and 11-deoxycorticosterone, were also measured. Dialysance rates of 18-OH-B, aldosterone, and cortisol were calculated (n = 8). Plasma levels of both aldosterone (P less than 0.05) and 18-OH-B (p less than 0.01) decreased during hemodialysis. The 18-OH-B/aldosterone plasma concentration ratios did not change significantly during hemodialysis. No significant changes in plasma levels of fasciculata steroids were observed during hemodialysis. Dialysance rates for aldosterone and 18-OH-B were similar (P not significant). The dialysance of cortisol was 10-fold lower than that of aldosterone (P less than 0.01) and 18-OH-B (P less than 0.01). The relative constancy of the 18-OH-B/aldosterone plasma concentration ratios indicates that corticosterone methyloxidase II activity is normal in patients with end-stage renal disease who are maintained by hemodialysis.\r"

We compared the antiaggregatory effect of equimolar concentrations of these two agents with that of a newly synthesized prostacyclin analogue, iloprost, and measured the effects of these agents on intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in human platelets. In addition, because the platelet inhibitory properties of prostanoids are associated with increased vasoactivity, we assessed the effects of each prostanoid on coronary flow in isolated perfused rat hearts. Concentrations ranging from 0.0001 mumol/L to 1 mumol/L of iloprost, PGI2, and PGE1 were incubated with either platelet-rich plasma or gel-filtered platelets. Greater than 90% inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to threshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (n = 6) and epinephrine (n = 6) was observed in all donors when 0.01 mumol/L iloprost, 0.1 mumol/L PGI2, and 1 mumol/L PGE1 were added to platelet-rich plasma. In gel-filtered platelets, at threshold concentrations of thrombin (n = 6), 90% inhibition was observed with 0.01 mumol/L iloprost. In contrast, similar inhibition to thrombin required 0.1 mumol/L PGI2, and with PGE1 it was never achieved in two donors. At 0.01 mumol/L of prostanoid, cAMP levels (n = 6) rose from a baseline value of 439 +/- 99 pmol/10(9) platelets to 1857 +/- 454 pmol/10(9) platelets for iloprost, 758 +/- 99 pmol/10(9) platelets for PGI2, and 692 +/- 199 pmol/10(9) platelets for PGE1. In addition, at 6 mumol/L, alterations in coronary flow (P greater than 0.05) were noted to be 127% of baseline values for iloprost (n = 5) and 153% for PGI2 (n = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the latter, Ceravital otological prosthesis were placed in human fibroblast culture. Reactions to the biomaterial were assessed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with chemical analysis facilities (EDAX, WDAX) and light microscopy. The interface reactions were similar in both in vivo and in vitro studies and confirmed the findings of other authors regarding the implants' biocompatibility and bioactivity. The technique of ion etching, however, enabled clear demonstration of this bioactivity on the implant surface, exposed merely to the middle-ear secretions, thus questioning the necessity of placing bone pate on the implant head at surgery, in order to encourage bioactive bonding with the overlying drum. A clinical trial of Ceravital in 128 patients with an average follow-up period of 2 years is reported. Forty per cent of these patients underwent a type II tympanoplasty, 60 per cent a type III. Though relatively short-term, the results to date have been encouraging: 88 per cent of the implants have been well-tolerated; 70 per cent of the cases have yielded a satisfactory hearing result; and only 3 per cent of the implanted prostheses have been extruded.\r"

It appears to afflict approximately 5 percent of female college students in the United States. Most sufferers are high-achieving but passive and unassertive young women from similarly high-achieving but disorganized families. Confusion over social roles for women is common in bulimic patients. Bulimia shows a strong association with affective disorders; depression is common in both bulimic patients and their close family members. Bulimic patients seem to have a pronounced affective vulnerability to rejection, loss, and failure. Bulimia presents a special diagnostic challenge to the primary care physician because of the paucity of clues provided by a typical review of systems and a physical examination, even a very thorough one. Making the diagnosis requires persistent and thorough history-gathering and is best accomplished through special attention to the psychosocial history (particularly history of depression and substance abuse, family dynamics, and recent stressors) as well as pointed questioning regarding eating behavior. Because of the severe, potentially lethal complications that may attend bulimia (including fluid and electrolyte imbalance, cardiac conduction abnormalities, gastric rupture, pneumonia), diagnosis and appropriate referral by the primary care physician may have a critical impact on the patient's life and health.\r"

In light of these facts, the psychostimulants MPH and DEA were administered in separate trials to a young man who suffered from similar symptoms secondary to a chronic closed head injury. The medication trials were double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response studies. Cognitive functions, particularly memory and attention, improved in the active drug conditions. In addition, there was a consistent, positive drug effect across behavioral assessments.

First, analyses in 20 agoraphobic patients given single-blind placebo over a 2-week period, without the customary confound of instructions for exposure to phobic situations, revealed a statistically significant reduction in panic and phobic symptoms. However, symptoms remained in the moderate to severe range and functioning was virtually unchanged. Second, comparisons between six agoraphobic patients receiving double-blind placebo and six others receiving \"no pills,\" matched for age, sex and exposure treatment, revealed a significant placebo effect over an 8-week period. Implications for clinical research are briefly discussed.\r"

Both imaging techniques were found to produce an accuracy of better than 2 mm with the exception of the Z coordinate as measured by CT (2.3 mm). This latter error is greater because of the 3 mm slice width used. Direct coronal views were used to determine Z more accurately using MRI. The measurement procedures are described and it is shown that the Leksell system of using orthogonal coordinates enables the scaling of images, which is particularly necessary with MRI, to be done easily.\r"

It is an effective emergency treatment for many cases of intractable epistaxis. It is useful prior to surgery to reduce blood loss from hypervascular tumours, including juvenile angiofibromas, paragangliomas and basal meningiomas, and from angiomas or soft tissue or of bone prior to excision, dental extraction or laminectomy. Embolisation is a satisfactory palliative treatment for angiomas involving superficial tissues, in which the cosmetic effects of surgery are unlikely to be satisfactory, and of mucosal surfaces causing intractable bleeding. In inoperable tumours, embolisation can relieve pain, bleeding, pulsatile tinnitus or discomfort due to mass effect.\r"

The radioresponsiveness of the two most common malignancies associated with AIDS, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and malignant lymphoma (ML), has been demonstrated. We have documented satisfactory time-dose relationships for the management of multiple manifestations of KS, including cutaneous and deep subcutaneous extremity involvement, visceral lesions, and AIDS-associated lymphadenopathy. A similar time-dose construct has been documented for ML, involving the brain and both central and peripheral lymph nodes. Irradiation can provide good to excellent palliation with only minimal side effects, and will produce a lesser impact on the hematological and immunological systems than chemotherapy. Therefore, we advocate the liberal employment of palliative radiation therapy in patients with AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a new single step technique for placement of indwelling silastic subclavian right atrial catheters through a short subcutaneous tunnel that is simple, relatively inexpensive, and can be done in the outpatient clinic. Between December 1984 and July 1986, 130 catheters were inserted in 122 patients using this approach for a cumulative total of 8,900 catheter days. Major complications have included five catheter infections with bacteremia, two procedure-related pneumothoraces, one internal jugular vein thrombosis, and one catheter fragment embolization to the right heart (total major complication rate, 6.9%). Minor complications have included five catheter migrations, seven catheter or catheter hub leaks, and two irreversible lumen occlusions (total minor complication rate 10.8%). Damaged or malpositioned catheters can be replaced through the same subcutaneous tract using a guidewire exchange technique. When this has not been possible, we have not encountered technical difficulties (due to subclavian thrombosis or stenosis) prohibiting insertion of a new catheter, even on the same side. These catheters provide reliable venous access for patients requiring frequent blood sampling, intravenous (IV) fluid or blood product administration, chemotherapy, IV narcotics for pain control, long-term antibiotic therapy, or hyperalimentation. They are ideal for infusion of vesicant chemotherapeutic agents and for patients undergoing ambulatory outpatient infusion chemotherapy. They have a low overall morbidity rate and excellent patient acceptance. Catheter maintenance procedures are simple and non-time-consuming. The same technique can be used to place multichannel catheters in patients requiring greater venous access. We now recommend early placement of these catheters in patients who will require frequent phlebotomy or drug administration during the course of their treatment.\r"

One hundred eighty-five patients were evaluable for treatment efficacy. MTC plus P was significantly superior to MTC alone in reducing the number and length of vomiting episodes (P = .001 and P = .0008, respectively) and the maximal intensity of nausea (P = .0124 with a score system; P = .0155 with a linear analogue scale) and length of nausea (P = .0056). The subgroup with a major incidence of nausea and vomiting was women, especially young women, outpatients, and those treated with higher doses of cisplatin. Side effects were low and equally distributed between the two treatment groups. We conclude that MTC plus P has greater antiemetic activity than MTC alone in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.\r"

Fifty-nine patients with nonmetastatic classic intramedullary osteosarcoma were randomized; 32 received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of high-dose methotrexate, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and BCD (bleomycin, cytoxan, actinomycin D), and 27 patients received no adjuvant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 2 years, there was a statistically significant improvement in both disease-free and overall survival in those who received adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, there was no difference in the less than 20% disease-free or overall survival of patients treated in the 1970s who did not receive chemotherapy, as compared with the concurrent nontreatment controls. Therefore, with identical staging procedures, uniform surgical management, and standard pathologic evaluation, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy definitely improves disease-free and overall survival in patients with osteosarcoma.\r"

In 232 previously untreated patients, three cycles of either combination preceded and followed extensive irradiation. The complete remission rate was 80.7% following MOPP and 92.4% following ABVD (P less than .02). The 7-year results indicated that ABVD was superior to MOPP in terms of freedom from progression (80.8% v 62.8%; P less than .002), relapse-free survival (87.7% v 77.2%; P = .06), and overall survival (77.4% v 67.9%; P = .03). Moreover, the comparative iatrogenic morbidity showed that irreversible gonadal dysfunction as well as acute leukemia occurred only in patients subjected to MOPP, while cardiopulmonary studies failed to document significant laboratory differences between the two treatment groups. Present findings indicate that ABVD followed by extensive irradiation represents a valid therapeutic alternative to the widely used alkylating agent-containing regimens plus radiotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The need for a pretreatment staging system to accurately assess programs of therapy for the various sites and stages of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has become apparent as detailed analyses of many factors affecting prognosis and treatment choices have been accomplished through the national cooperative trial, the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS). Initiated in 1972, the IRS has thus far used a clinicopathologic grouping system that is based heavily on therapeutic decisions, particularly on whether or not excision is accomplished and the extent of such an operation. The major problem with this and several other staging classifications now in use is that they depend on pathologic data obtained after surgical treatment has been initiated or rejected. In addition, they do not consider histologic variations of this neoplasm which may be important in estimating prognosis. The large body of clinical data now accumulated in the IRS has provided an excellent opportunity for developing a database for evaluating the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) pretreatment staging system and also the potential for using histologic categories in the staging process. The records of 505 eligible patients entered into the IRS between 1978 and 1982 were used to determine the prognostic impact of a number of pretreatment factors. These included local invasiveness of the primary neoplasm on clinical examination, tumor size, clinical status of regional nodes, clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastases, and favorable or unfavorable histologic categories. A retrospective assessment of the relationship of these pretreatment observations to survival experience has been carried out. This retrospective study indicates definite prognostic significance for all of the individual factors used on the UICC system except clinical status of regional nodes. Also, these data serve as a basis for considering the possibility of including favorable v unfavorable histology in the pretreatment staging system now being tested prospectively in the ongoing IRS protocols.\r"

  ".W": "In 1980, a consensus chemotherapy intergroup study for advanced malignant mesothelioma was initiated based on a collaborative agreement among the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), and the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG). The purpose of the study was to evaluate cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 day 1), imidazole carboxamide (250 mg/m2 days 1 through 5), and doxorubicin (Adriamycin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (50 mg/m2 day 1) v cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) and doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) in a randomized prospective clinical trial involving 76 fully evaluable patients with advanced stages II to IV malignant mesothelioma. A total of nine responses (12%) were documented, including three complete and six partial responses. There was no significant difference in response duration or survival between treatment arms. Leukopenia (greater than 2,000/microL) was observed in 46% of patients treated with the three-drug combination and 38% of patients receiving the two-drug combination. The variables of performance status 0-1 and the absence of prior chemotherapy/radiotherapy were significant with respect to favorable impact on survival. We conclude, based on the minimal benefit observed, that the combination of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin with or without imidazole carboxamide does not warrant further investigation in patients with advanced-stage malignant mesothelioma.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to be treated within a protected environment (laminar air flow room), with prophylactic antibiotics, or in a standard hospital room. Important patient characteristics were equally distributed in the two treatment arms. A major objective response was observed in 27 of the 32 evaluable patients (84%), and 11 (34%) achieved a complete remission (CR). There was no significant difference in overall and complete response rates between the two treatment arms, nor was there a substantial difference in times to progression or survival between the groups treated in or out of the protected environment. Comparison of the results of this study with previously reported programs of FAC chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer shows that this study achieved higher overall and complete response rates. However, neither the time to progression, nor the survival of responders or the entire patient group was different from our previous experience with standard FAC chemotherapy. When the study was initiated in 1976, the proposed dose escalation represented high-dose chemotherapy. In retrospect, even the \"high\" doses used in this study represent only a modest increase over standard doses of chemotherapy. Much steeper dose escalations will be needed to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy in breast cancer, as well as the protective value of the protected environment and prophylactic antibiotics in metastatic breast cancer.\r"

Myelosuppression was the main toxicity, with World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3/4 leucopenia occurring in 44% of patients. There was one (2%) treatment-related neutropenic death. Treatment was otherwise well tolerated, and in particular no renal toxicity, neurotoxicity, or ototoxicity was seen.

Dose levels were 180, 240, 300, 360, and 420 mg/m2. Twenty-eight patients had squamous-cell cancers and one had an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the parotid. There were 26 patients with recurrent disease; 22 had received prior RT; only two had received other chemotherapy immediately before study entry. Three patients had newly diagnosed incurable stage IV disease. The median performance status was 80% (range, 60% to 90%). All patients had objectively measurable disease, and 28 were evaluable for response. There were three complete responses (CRs) and ten partial responses (PRs) (48% CR and PR); the median duration of response was 4.7 months (range, 1.5 to 15+ months). Dose-limiting toxicities were granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and stomatitis. Prolonged myelosuppression delayed retreatment in eight patients and delayed 19 of 107 (18%) courses. Stomatitis occurred in 61% and diarrhea in 29%. 5-FU dosage was decreased in ten patients (36%) for grade 2 or greater stomatitis or diarrhea. Mild to moderate nausea and vomiting occurred in 66% of patient trials in which no pretreatment antiemetics were administered. Other toxicities included phlebitis from 5-FU in 71%, skin toxicity in 11%, mild alopecia in 25%, and fatigue in 54% of patients. Nephrotoxicity (creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL) occurred in one patient. The dose of carboplatin resulting in grade 2 toxicity was 180 mg/m2 in one patient, 240 mg/m2 in one, 300 mg/m2 in seven, 360 mg/m2 in ten, and 420 mg/m2 in one. Based on these results, we recommend a starting dose of carboplatin, 300 mg/m2, in combination with five days of continuous infusion 5-FU. In this dose and schedule, this combination was well tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity in head and neck cancer. To confirm these promising results, a Southwest Oncology Group prospective randomized trial is in progress comparing carboplatin and 5-FU, cisplatin and 5-FU, and standard-dose weekly methotrexate in recurrent-disease patients.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty previously treated refractory ovarian cancer patients, all of whom received prior therapy with cisplatin, were treated in a phase II trial with high-dose carboplatin (800 mg/m2 per cycle with cycles administered every 35 days). Patients were treated with high-dose carboplatin when they were no longer responding to prior therapy or had relapsed after an initial response. Objective responses were achieved in eight of 30 patients (27%) while ten patients had minor responses or stable disease. No responses were observed from high-dose carboplatin in patients who had progressive disease during prior therapy with a cisplatin-based regimen. The primary toxicity of high-dose carboplatin was myelosuppression with a median WBC nadir of 0.6 and a median platelet nadir of 6,500 after the first cycle of therapy. Myelosuppression was not particularly cumulative as 78% of patients were able to receive either 100% or 75% of the projected dose even with the fourth cycle of high-dose carboplatin. The gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity of carboplatin was mild and there was no clinically apparent nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity. These results demonstrate that: there is marked cross-resistance between cisplatin and carboplatin, and high-dose carboplatin may be a potential alternative to high-dose cisplatin in the treatment of ovarian cancer patients.\r"

US found six patients with extrahepatic intraabdominal disease, while PS found none.

  ".W": "Since January 1983, 56 consecutive children over 1 year of age with stage IV neuroblastoma entered an aggressive protocol, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. The induction protocol included platinum and epipodophyllotoxin (VM-26), alternating with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and vincristine (PE/CADO). Surgery was performed after 2 to 4 months, and consolidation with intensive chemoradiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed within 12 months of diagnosis. The combination of vincristine, melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI) was used before BMT, and no further treatment was administered before progression. With the exception of two allografts, autologous BMT (ABMT) was given in all cases and was purged using an immunomagnetic procedure (Kemshead technique) in 32 of 35 cases, and a chemical procedure in three of 35. Of the 56 patients, 45 were evaluable. Of those, 23 were grafted in partial remission (PR), and 14 were grafted in either complete remission (CR) or very good partial remission (VGPR). The acute toxic death rate was 19%, the relapse rate was 32%, and the progressive disease rate was 19%. The progression-free survival in the CR/VGPR group (ie, 44% at 32 months post-diagnosis) and in the PR group (13% at 32 months) was not significantly different (P greater than .05). At 24 months, the overall survival of the 56 unselected patients was 39% compared with 12% for comparable patients previously treated by our group (P less than .005).\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine the clinical applicability of the in vitro observation of enhanced cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the presence of excess reduced folates, the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performed a randomized trial evaluating two dose schedules of 5-FU and folinic acid (FA) in 128 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Of 125 eligible patients, 62 were randomized to receive bolus FA (200 mg/m2 days 1 through 4) in addition to 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2 days 1 through 4) by continuous four-day infusion (infusion arm), while 63 were randomized to receive bolus FA (200 mg/m2 days 1 through 5) in addition to 5-FU (325 mg/m2 days 1 through 5) by bolus injection (bolus arm). The toxicities of the two schedules differed, with stomatitis being more severe in the infusion arm and leukopenia being more severe in the bolus arm. The response rates and survival data for the two arms are nearly identical. The median survival of patients on the infusion arm is 11.0 months and of patients on the bolus arm, 10.3 months. The infusion arm produced one complete response (CR) and 12 partial responses (PRs), for a major response rate of 21% of eligible patients. The bolus arm produced three CRs and 11 PRs, for a major response rate of 22% of eligible patients. The response rate produced is minimally superior to recent cooperative group studies of colorectal cancer, but the response rate and survival experience are within the range of experience for treatment with 5-FU alone.\r"

The SC dosage was 2 X 10(6) IU/m2 three times weekly, and the IV dose 30 X 10(6) IU/m2 for five consecutive days every 3 weeks. Dose escalation to a maximum of 10 X 10(6) IU/m2 SC and 50 X 10(6) IU/m2 IV was allowed for patients with minimal or absent toxicity. Five of 51 of the SC-treated patients (10%) and three of 46 of the IV-treated patients (7%) had a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). Patients with prior nephrectomy, no prior treatment, and lack of bone metastases were most likely to respond, and a retrospective analysis of this subgroup revealed a 23% response rate. Achievement of response took from 3 weeks to 11 months, while response duration lasted from 3 to 31+ months. All responders had prior nephrectomy; six of eight had no prior chemotherapy or hormonal therapy; five had lung metastases, and none had bone metastases. Regardless of route, almost all patients developed a flu-like syndrome; however, grade 3 or greater toxicity was much more common for IV-treated patients. This trial demonstrates modest, but definite antitumor activity for recombinant interferon in advanced renal cell carcinoma. SC administration with lower dose and toxicity is as effective as treatment administered IV.\r"

In retrospective studies, the assays correctly predict clinical response to a chemotherapeutic agent in 50% to 70% of patients and predict clinical resistance in nearly 100% of patients. All of the assays suffer from technical and theoretical problems. In vitro assays depend on cell culture and therefore do not entirely simulate in vivo conditions. Heterogeneity in chemosensitivity is commonly found and can complicate the interpretation of results. Further investigation is needed to determine if these assays will be able to select prospective chemotherapy for patients. The malignant origin of the cells in culture must be verified if meaningful conclusions are to be made.\r"

  ".W": "Since computerized tomography (CT) scanning became available at the University Health Center of Pittsburgh in July, 1975, 17 patients have undergone removal of colloid cysts of the third ventricle by transfrontal, transcallosal, or stereotaxic surgery. All patients presented with symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure; CT scanning proved to be the best neurodiagnostic test to define the colloid cysts. Since the development of CT-guided stereotaxic surgery, the authors have preferentially performed stereotaxic aspiration in seven patients; three of these subsequently required craniotomies to remove residual cysts producing persistent symptoms. The viscosity of the intracystic colloid material and/or displacement of the cyst away from the aspiration needle were reasons for unsuccessful aspiration; the CT appearance did not correlate with the ability to aspirate the lesion by the sterotaxic technique. Postoperative patency of the ventricular system was documented by intraoperative CT ventriculography performed during stereotaxic surgery. Removal of the cyst wall was not necessary. Because of the low associated morbidity rate, percutaneous stereotaxic aspiration is recommended as the initial treatment of choice for colloid cysts of the third ventricle. If stereotaxic aspiration fails and symptoms persist, craniotomy should be performed.\r"

  ".W": "To date, most patients suffering from hydrocephalus have been treated by insertion of differential-pressure valves that have fairly constant resistance. Since intracranial pressure (ICP) is a variable parameter (depending on such factors as patient's position and rapid eye movement sleep) and since cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion is almost constant, it may be assumed that some shunt complications are related to too much or too little CSF drainage. The authors suggest a new approach to treating hydrocephalus, the aim of which is to provide CSF drainage at or below the CSF secretion rate within a physiological ICP range. This concept has led the authors to develop a three-stage valve system. The first stage consists of a medium-pressure low-resistance valve that operates as a conventional differential-pressure valve until the flow through the shunt reaches a mean value of 20 ml/hr. A second stage consists of a variable-resistance flow regulator that maintains flow between 20 and 30 ml/hr at differential pressures of 80 to 350 mm H2O. The third stage is a safety device that operates at differential pressures above 350 mm H2O (inducing a rapid increase in CSF flow rate) and therefore prevents hyper-elevated ICP. An in vitro study is described that demonstrates the capability of this system to maintain flow rates close to CSF production under a range of pressures similar to those observed under various human physiological and postural conditions. Promising clinical results in 19 patients shunted with this valve are summarized.\r"

  ".W": "Pituitary tumors in which no excess hormone secretion can be identified clinically have been considered as nonfunctioning or null-cell adenomas. Immunocytochemical data presented here suggest that many of these tumors contain subunits of the glycoprotein hormones. Of 160 patients referred for pituitary surgery, 37 (23%) had no evidence of excess hormone secretion on preoperative endocrine evaluation. Immunocytochemical staining of these tumors was carried out using antibodies specific for prolactin, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, the beta subunits of luteinizing hormone (beta-LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (beta-FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (beta-TSH), and the alpha subunit. One or more of these pituitary hormones were detected in 73% of cases. The alpha and beta subunits were detected most frequently, being found in 68% of cases; 27% had staining for one or more beta subunits and 37.9% had staining for both alpha and beta subunits. The incidence was: beta-FSH in 58%, beta-LH in 47%, beta-TSH in 33%, and the alpha subunit in 42%. Staining for multiple glycoprotein hormones was common (52%), and mixed glycoprotein hormones and prolactin cell types were found in 16% of cases. These data suggest that most apparently nonfunctioning pituitary tumors contain immunoreactive hormones and the majority of these are subunits of the glycoprotein hormones. Since the glycoprotein hormone beta subunits must combine with the alpha subunit to produce biologically active hormones, the production of the subunits alone may not have endocrine manifestations.\r"

He was the prototype of the physiological chemist studying intricate problems of intermediary metabolism in the whole animal or human body. His early scientific reports on choline and amino acid metabolism set a high standard for intellectual precision and literary clarity. Dr. Griffith's last research paper was entitled \"The Present Knowledge of Methyl Groups in Nutrition\" and appeared in Nutrition Reviews in 1968. In this paper he reviews the substance of figure 2, which depicts the advancement in knowledge of choline metabolism, methyl biosynthesis, and transmethylation during his career. It is fortunate that Dr. Griffith was able to witness many of the developments in a field that he had pioneered. If he were alive today, he would be delighted to see how much further this field has moved. Wendell Griffith was a complete man. He combined the traits of high intelligence with a selfless patience and kindness, uncommon in productive scientists. His lucid and absorbing lectures were a joy to his students. Furthermore, he was a mentor with warmth and charm in his relationships to his graduate students and young faculty members and was a superb role model for them. After they left his department he was most supportive. Part of his own rejuvenation, I am sure, occurred in the out-of-doors where he loved to garden, hike and fish. Griff did not grow old, or it seemed he did not. He died at the age of 72 in Baltimore from a brain tumor that was of relatively sudden onset, and is buried in Oak Hill cemetery in Kirkwood, MO, a suburb of St. Louis. He enriched the lives of all of us who had the good fortune to know him. Moreover, his work lives on to stimulate the minds of all serious students of biochemistry and nutrition.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives were to determine the effects of daily injection of bovine growth hormone (bGH) on the metabolism of [1-14C]leucine and [1-14C]palmitate and on hormone and metabolite concentrations in growing Hereford heifers. The experimental design was a 28-d single reversal with two 14-d injection periods of placebo or bGH. Energy intake was restricted to a level slightly above maintenance. Injection of bGH did not affect circulating concentrations of glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, urea nitrogen, prolactin, triiodothyronine or thyroxine. Plasma concentrations of insulin and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were chronically elevated whereas leucine concentration was chronically decreased after 1 wk of bGH injection compared to placebo injection. Leucine oxidation was lower and whole-body protein synthesis was higher during bGH injection than during placebo injection. There were increases in both total irreversible loss and oxidation of NEFA during bGH injection compared to placebo injection. These results suggest mobilization of stored fatty acids and increased reliance on NEFA to provide energy for cellular processes. The dual and reciprocal effects of bGH on nitrogen and NEFA metabolism demonstrate its role as a homeorhetic regulator, affecting metabolism of several body tissues to support lean body accretion in Hereford heifers at near-maintenance intake of metabolizable energy.\r"

The 3-d fast decreased blood glucose from 55 to 49 mg/dl due to a 40% reduction in its splanchnic output. Plasma FFA increased from 280 to 872 and 912 microM in 1- and 3-d-fasted ewes concomitant with increased omental and peripheral release. Hepatic uptake of FFA increased three- and fourfold and was concentration-dependent. Consequently, hepatic release of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate increased from -43 and 276 to 90 and 1304 mumol/min, respectively, in 3-d-fasted ewes. Alimentary ketogenesis ceased entirely due to lack of substrate and gut tissue was actually utilizing both ketone bodies by d 3 of fast. Lower hindquarter utilization of both ketone bodies increased with increasing circulating concentrations. Insulin seemed to be the major mechanism of regulation of glucose, FFA and ketone body metabolism since pancreatic production and arterial concentrations of insulin decreased with progressive fasting. No changes were observed in glucagon concentrations or net fluxes, and therefore the role of glucagon was passive and secondary to that of insulin.\r"

Carcass composition was measured on one group from each treatment. The remaining rats returned to ad libitum feeding. The 160% rats were hypophagic and lost weight. Starved and 40% rats were hyperphagic and gained weight. Serum insulin increased with increased food intake. T4 was depressed by food restriction. T3 and T4 increased during weight loss in 160% rats. Carcass composition of rats from each treatment was determined at progressive stages of recovery. Overfed rats had gained 7 g of protein and 43 g of fat. Protein was soon lost but fat was still significantly increased after 44 d of recovery. Starved and restricted rats had lost 11 g of protein and 28 g of fat. Starved rats regained protein earlier than body fat. Restricted rats recovered body fat much earlier than body protein or weight. Body protein and fat may have individual regulatory mechanisms that work together to control body weight.\r"

The authors examined the predictive value of a total T4 measurement in the evaluation of ambulatory general medical patients suspected of having hypothyroidism. Pregnant patients and those who were taking medications that interfere with thyroid homeostasis were excluded. Simultaneous T4 and thyrotropin (TSH) tests of 93 consecutive outpatients suspected to have hypothyroidism but found to be euthyroid and 27 patients discovered to be hypothyroid (TSH greater than 10 microU/ml) were examined. A T4 of 7.0 microliter/dl or less had a sensitivity of 93% with a false-positive rate of 19%. A T4 greater than 8.0 microgram/dl appeared to exclude hypothyroidism (negative posttest probability of 100%). It may be possible to achieve cost savings without loss of diagnostic accuracy by using a single total T4 measurement for the initial evaluation of suspected hypothyroidism in selected outpatients.\r"

To reappraise this evidence, the authors used a new analytic strategy in which the 14 available randomized clinical trials were evaluated according to a methodologic \"review of systems\" and an examination of the statistical precision of the outcome results. Although none of the trials satisfied all of the methodologic criteria for both validity and clinical pertinence, the trials finding steroids efficacious were generally better designed and more statistically precise than trials failing to show efficacy. The authors propose a set of five main methodologic guidelines that require a stable baseline state, a crossover design with suitable washout, adequate doses of corticosteroids, pragmatic designs, and comprehensive choices of outcome events. Attention to these guidelines can help improve both design and evaluation for future trials of systemic steroids for stable COPD.\r"

With the exception of time elapsed before appropriate treatment, these factors were used in discriminant analysis to identify patients who would die during hospital admission from bacteremic infection. The resulting model, which had a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 68% in the first group of patients, was validated in a second cohort with a sensitivity of 40% and a specificity of 69%. This analysis presents a model that may allow clinicians to assess the risk of death from community-acquired bacteremic infections.\r"

In pretreatment urine cultures, 79% of patients had a single pathogen and 77% had colony counts of 100,000 or more organisms per ml. Non-Escherichia coli infections and positive blood cultures were the only two independent predictors of the concomitant renal stones or genitourinary tract abnormalities that were found in 29% of patients with pyelonephritis. About 15% of all patients continued to have temperatures greater than or equal to 101 degrees F 48 hours after the initiation of antibiotic therapy, but persistent fever did not correlate with a history of prior urinary tract infection, the presence of resistant pathogens, renal stones, or genitourinary tract abnormalities. The authors conclude that many of these patients did not have pyelonephritis, and that certain characteristics correlate with the presence of underlying anatomic abnormalities.\r"

Standardized ventilatory protocols were used for 48 hours, after which CV was administered to both groups. Despite comparable oxygenation (arterial/alveolar oxygen tension ratio), mean airway pressure was lower in the HFJV group (9 +/- 2 vs 13 +/- 2 cm H2O, P less than 0.001), and thus the arterial/alveolar oxygen tension ratio corrected for mean airway pressure was improved in the HFJV group (P less than 0.05). PaCO2 was lower during HFJV (37 +/- 3 vs 42 +/- 3 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) despite a comparable peak inspiratory pressure. The incidence of air leaks, progression of intraventricular hemorrhage, and mortality during the 48-hour period did not differ between the two groups. Bronchoscopies in eight infants given HFJV and five given CV revealed no microscopic evidence of necrotizing tracheobronchitis, but one infant given HFJV had evidence of necrotizing tracheitis at autopsy. We conclude that for 48 hours during the acute stage of respiratory distress syndrome, HFJV can maintain adequate gas exchange at lower mean airway pressure than during CV, without an increase in the incidence of side effects.\r"

A chronic intrathecal infusion of the relatively selective delta agonist, [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), produced a larger degree of tolerance to DADLE than to the highly specific mu-activating morphiceptin analog [N-methyl-Phe3, D-Pro4]morphiceptin (PL017). The slope of the analgesic dose-response curve for the highly specific delta agonist, cyclic [D-Penicillamine2, D-Penicillamine5]enkephalin (DPDPE), was significantly different (flatter) from those of mu agonists or DADLE. High-dose infusion of PL017 induced a 61-fold parallel shift of the dose-response curve for PL017. This same treatment also induced a corresponding flattened, nonparallel change of the dose-response curve for DADLE. This altered curve for DADLE was very similar in slope to that of DPDPE. Pretreatment with the irreversible mu antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine, caused a parallel rightward shift of the dose-response curve for PL017 but did not affect DPDPE activity. beta-Funaltrexamine treatment induced a nonparallel rightward shift of the dose-response curve for DADLE with a change of slope similar to that of DPDPE. These findings demonstrate a mixed mu-delta analgesic activity for the compound DADLE, which is often referred to as a prototypic delta agonist. These interactions differ from prior reports of none or minimal mu-ligand interactions with DADLE. Despite the cross-reactivity of DADLE to mu receptors, DADLE remains a more effective analgesic than do mu agonists in states of mu receptor tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The circumflex coronary artery of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs was partially obstructed with an externally applied rigid plastic band. Platelet aggregation at the site of stenosis caused a gradual decline in blood flow in the artery, which was monitored with an electromagnetic flow probe placed proximally to the obstructor. The effects of drugs on platelet aggregation were evaluated by monitoring changes in both the rate and the degree of decline in blood flow. In most dogs, aspirin inhibited intravascular platelet aggregation (ED50 = 1 mg/kg). Dipyridamole, even at doses that severely depressed blood pressure (1 mg/kg), had no effect on platelet aggregation. However, in dogs that had been pretreated with a low dose of dipyridamole (0.2 mg/kg), the antiaggregatory activity of aspirin was enhanced. This potentiation was evident only at low doses of aspirin (0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg), where the drug was 10 times more active; at high aspirin doses, which depressed vascular cyclooxygenase, no potentiation was seen. Further evidence that the mechanism of this synergism may depend on endogenous prostacyclin production at the site of the partial obstruction was seen when cyclooxygenase inhibitors applied topically on the exposed artery eliminated the antiaggregatory effect of low doses of aspirin. It is important to note that the protective effect of dipyridamole and low-dose aspirin was less than that seen at the high doses of aspirin alone, suggesting that the theoretical benefits of platelet-specific doses of aspirin may be overstated.\r"

Activation of either DA-2- or DA-1-like receptors by quinpirole or fenoldopam, respectively, leads to inhibition of ganglionic transmission. In the present study we have examined the involvement of DA receptor subtypes in the action of DA on ganglionic transmission. Inasmuch as stimulation of DA receptors is linked to the activation (DA-1) or inhibition (DA-2) of the enzyme adenylate cyclase, we have also measured the accumulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) for biochemical characterization of ganglionic DA receptors. In isolated stellate ganglia treated with phentolamine and propranolol, DA caused concentration-dependent inhibition of ganglionic transmission as evidenced by reductions in the amplitude of the evoked postganglionic compound action potentials. The inhibitory effect of DA on ganglionic transmission was antagonized by both the DA-1 receptor antagonist, R-sulpiride, and the DA-2 receptor antagonist, S-sulpiride. However, the more potent and selective DA-1 receptor antagonist, SCH-23390, failed to antagonize the DA-induced inhibition of ganglionic transmission. Isolated stellate ganglia were also utilized for the measurement of cAMP. Neither DA nor the selective DA-1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam, caused any significant changes in cAMP, suggesting the lack of an adenylate cyclase-linked DA-1 receptor in the ganglia. On the other hand, beta adrenoceptor activation by isoproterenol produced a 3-fold increase in cAMP content of the stellate ganglia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After a 1-day preculture in control medium, 3.3 X 10(-6) M retinoic acid (RET) treatment for 1 day stimulated PG release several fold. RET also caused a large decrease in PG synthesis that returned to the control level after a 3-day recovery period. The effect on PG synthesis was observed at serum levels of 5 and 0.05%. The effect of RET on PG release required protein synthesis, inasmuch as it was lost in cultures maintained in media without amino acids or in a low volume of media. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment for 2 days also stimulated PG release. More PG was released after RET than after IL-1 or LPS, and only RET produced an effect that was evident by day 1. The amount of CMP that produced the same size effect on PG release as these stimulators was below the detection level of PG protease assays. Three potent CMP inhibitors reduced RET-, IL-1- and LPS-stimulated PG release to control levels. These inhibitors did not block another action of RET on chondrocytes, namely the inhibition of PG synthesis by RET immediately after treatment. The inhibitors did not act by reducing cell viability, because recovery of the rate of PG synthesis 3 days post-treatment occurred in inhibitor-treated cultures. These studies suggest that CMP is involved in cartilage autolysis that is stimulated by RET and IL-1.\r"

In the present experiments, we examined the effect of PCP on NMDA and kainic acid (KA)-induced release of [3H]norepinephrine (NE) from superfused rat hippocampal slices. NMDA and KA stimulated the efflux of NE with EC50 values of 192 and 245 microM, respectively. The presence of 1.2 mM MgCl2 in the buffer abolished NMDA-induced release but had little effect on KA-induced release. PCP inhibited the release of [3H]NE induced by 100 microM NMDA with an IC50 of 46 nM, but had no effect on the release of NE stimulated by 300 microM KA. 2-Aminophosphonovalerate antagonized NMDA-induced release, producing a parallel shift to the right in the concentration-response curve. However, PCP shifted the concentration-response curve to the right in a nonparallel fashion. Drugs with PCP-like properties, such as dexoxadrol and cyclazocine, inhibited NMDA-induced release, whereas related drugs such as levoxadrol, ethylketocyclazocine and morphine, which are not PCP-like, had no effect. These data suggest that PCP is a potent, selective, noncompetitive inhibitor of amino acid-induced [3H]NE release and that this action of PCP is mediated through the PCP/sigma receptor.\r"

Diabetes rats were assigned randomly to one of three regimens for 8 weeks: untreated, insulin-treated or vanadate-treated. Noninjected rats served as controls. In vivo myocardial contractile function was measured under basal conditions and after i.v. norepinephrine infusions in ketamine-xylazine-anesthetized rats using a miniature catheter-tip pressure transducer inserted in the right carotid artery and advanced into the left ventricle. Vanadate and insulin treatment resulted in comparable increases in body weight and reductions in plasma glucose, which were improved relative to untreated diabetics. These findings suggest that vanadium may possess an insulin-like action. Basal in vivo myocardial contractile performance was depressed significantly in untreated diabetic rats as compared to control and insulin-treated diabetic rats. The contractile performance of vanadate-treated diabetic rats was in between untreated diabetic and control groups. In vivo myocardial reactivity to norepinephrine based on assessments of left intraventricular developed pressure, positive and negative dP/dt and delta dP/dt was depressed significantly in untreated diabetic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The opioid receptor types involved in the mediation of enkephalin-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures were studied in unanesthetized, freely moving rats. Four receptor-selective peptide ligands were evaluated for effectiveness in producing nonconvulsive EEG seizures after i.c.v. administration; these included the mu agonist, [D-Ala2-N-methyl-Phe4-Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAGO), the mixed mu-delta agonist, [D-Ala2-D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), and the selective delta agonists, [D-Pen2-D-Pen5]enkephalin and [D-Pen2-L-Pen5]enkephalin. Only DAGO and DADLE were found to produce EEG seizures, with DAGO being 9 times more potent than DADLE. DAGO produced a greater number of seizure episodes with a greater overall incidence compared with DADLE, reflecting its potent effect to elicit EEG seizure activity in these rats. Injections of [D-Pen2-D-Pen5]enkephalin or [D-Pen2-L-Pen5]enkephalin, even at the highest doses tested, failed to produce seizure activity. Behaviorally, the DAGO and DADLE EEG seizures were nonconvulsive but were temporally associated with episodic bursts of wet-dog shakes. The enkephalin-induced responses were extremely sensitive to antagonism by naloxone and completely blocked by pretreatment with the irreversible mu antagonist beta-funaltrexamine. The selective delta opioid receptor antagonist ICI 174,864 (N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH) was ineffective. The use of the most selective agonists and antagonists for mu and delta opioid receptors suggests that, in rats, enkephalin-induced EEG seizures are mediated exclusively by mu opioid receptors and not by delta opioid systems.\r"
