  ".W": "Of 695 patients who, in a five-year period, underwent cystectomy for bladder cancer, 32 (4.6%) proved to have historical and pathologic Stage T1 (Stage A) transitional cell cancer. Of these, 23 (72%) had grade 3 disease or higher. Overall, in 17 (53%) progression developed after follow-up of greater than or equal to 5 years. Moreover, in 10 (31%) of the patients systemic progression developed during follow-up; less than 50 per cent of the patients were projected to be free of systemic progression at ten years. DNA ploidy pattern analysis did not prove helpful in predicting disease outcome. Because effective systemic chemotherapy has become available in the form of M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin), it seems justifiable that patients who are considered to be candidates for cystectomy because of high-grade, multifocal T1 transitional cell cancer of the bladder also could be candidates for effective neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, in addition to those who usually are part of these protocols--namely, those with greater than or equal to T2 disease.\r"

The uptake of 99mtechnetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (99mTc-DMSA) was measured at one- and two-hour intervals after injection, and the uptake was corrected for variations in renal depth. These values were compared with inulin, creatinine, and para-amino hippurate (PAH) clearances which were measured in each kidney by collecting urine through long-term catheterization. Correlation coefficient was obtained between PAH clearance corrected for the body surface area and the two-hour uptake of 99mTc-DMSA. The correlation coefficients between the two-hour uptake of 99mTc-DMSA and the clearance values are not significantly different from those between the one-hour uptake and the clearance values. Corrections of the uptake for variations in renal depth did not improve the correlation coefficients. The results show that 99mTc-DMSA is an excellent method to estimate the renal plasma flow and the one-hour uptake without correction for renal depth is clinically sufficient to evaluate the split renal function.\r"

The remaining 12 patients, representing true detrusor atony, continued to void without a detrusor contraction, and the majority (10/12) needed prolonged postoperative bladder drainage prior to resumption of spontaneous voiding. Presence of reduced flow rates and absence of detrusor contraction during preoperative voiding indicated true detrusor hypotonicity. Two thirds of the patients voiding with normal flow rates but without a detrusor contraction during preoperative voiding regained detrusor contraction after incontinence surgery (p less than 0.05).\r"

In three of them, including two siblings with a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, the IgM was bound to the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) of peripheral nerves. One had axonal neuropathy with IgM activity against the peri- and endoneurium, while another case with post-infectious neuritis had IgM activity against structures in the endoneurium but no IgM autoimmunity in the direct fluorescence test. The latter improved clinically in parallel with a decrease in the M-protein indicating a pathogenetic role of the autoantibody. In three other cases, the IgM was bound to connective tissue structures, two of them also had plasma antibodies against the peri- and endoneurium in the indirect fluorescence test. Finally, two cases showed no reaction of the M-protein against any tissue structures. Since an autoimmune pathogenesis is suspected, the HLA types of seven patients are reported.\r"

The influence of plasmapheresis varied for the different proteins. The plasma levels of IgG, IgA, CRP, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and haptoglobin decreased during plasmapheresis. The simultaneous reduction of the level of protein HC was smaller than that of IgG, IgA and haptoglobin. The plasma concentration of beta 2-microglobulin did not decrease during plasmapheresis. The recovery rates of the proteins were found to be approximately inversely related to their molecular weights.\r"

  ".W": "In a severe case of chloral hydrate intoxication treated with combined hemodialysis and hemoperfusion the pharmacokinetics of the metabolites trichloroethanol (TCE), trichloroethanol glucuronide (TCE-Glu) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) were studied. Indications of delayed absorption and some slowing of metabolism were found. At a blood flow rate of 200 ml/min clearances by hemodialysis and hemoperfusion, respectively, in ml/min were estimated to be 188 and 156 for TCE, 184 and 181 for TCE-Glu, 142 and 91 for TCA. Clearance by hemoperfusion declined with time. The half-lives of TCE and TCA were 3.2 and 4.3 hours during combined hemodialysis and hemoperfusion. After termination of treatment the half-life of TCE was 12.8 hours, whereas TCA was metabolized so slowly, that no reliable calculation could be performed. We conclude that hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are equally and highly efficient in the treatment of chloral hydrate poisoning, but hemoperfusion may increase the risk of gastric bleeding more than hemodialysis. Hemodialysis may therefore be preferable and should be tried in spite of low blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized study on early intracoronary thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), serial plasma enzyme activities were measured to analyze the rate of enzyme appearance in plasma with reference to treatment allocation, area at risk, and infarct size. Cumulative activities of alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) appearing in plasma in the first 24 hours (Q24), 48 hours (Q48), and 72 hours (Q72) were calculated to obtain infarct size (= Q72) and rate of HBDH appearance in plasma (= Q24/Q72). Analyzed on the basis of \"intention to treat\" in 448 patients with AMI, the mean Q24/Q72 value (+/- SEM) was 0.653 +/- 0.011 in 230 patients receiving thrombolytic therapy; this value was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than that observed in 218 patients receiving conventional therapy (0.504 +/- 0.012). In the thrombolysis group Q24/Q72 was independent of infarct size, whereas in the control group Q24/Q72 was negatively correlated with infarct size (r = -0.26; p less than 0.001). Plotted against the sum of ST segment elevations at admission (sigma ST) mean Q24 values were similar in both treatment groups, but mean Q48 and especially Q72 values were larger in the control group than in the thrombolysis group. We conclude that: (1) in reperfused infarctions the time course for development of infarct is accelerated in comparison to unreperfused infarcts; (2) this accelerated process of necrosis lasts about 40 to 50 hours, a duration that is hardly influenced by infarct size; and (3) the reperfusion-induced acceleration of enzyme release resembles the reoxygenation-induced enzyme release from anoxic hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-eight patients were prospectively treated with 1.5 million units of intravenous streptokinase within 4 hours of onset of chest pain. Intravenous heparin was begun after the streptokinase infusion was complete and was discontinued within 36 hours. Aspirin, 325 mg daily, and dipyridamole, 75 mg three times a day, was begun before the heparin was discontinued. Coronary angiography was performed both at 2 hours after completion of the streptokinase infusion and again at a mean of 8.7 (+/- 3.2) days after the initial catheterization. One patient died after treatment with streptokinase but before early angiography. In 21 of 27 patients (78%), Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial (TIMI) grade 2 or 3 perfusion in the infarct vessel was observed on initial angiography. Repeat angiograms were available in 17 of the 21 patients with initially patent vessels. Continued patency (TIMI grade 2 or 3) was found in 15 of the 17 patients (88%). Two of the four patients who did not undergo repeat angiography died, and the remaining two patients required coronary artery bypass grafting for unstable angina. Bleeding complications occurred in 6 of 27 patients (22%), with two (7%) requiring surgical evacuation of a groin hematoma. There were no instances of intracerebral bleeding and only two patients required transfusions. Thus, the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole following 36 hours of systemic heparinization after intravenous streptokinase infusion is associated with a reocclusion rate comparable to that which has been reported for more prolonged systemic anticoagulation with fewer hemorrhagic complications.\r"

At an injection rate at 13 cc/sec, the average background-subtracted peak gray level intensity of hand-agitated diatrizoate meglumine/diatrizoate sodium was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that of hand-agitated diatrizoate meglumine/diatrizoate sodium + 0.9% saline, sonicated diatrizoate meglumine/diatrizoate sodium, and sonicated 70% sorbitol. These differences were abolished by the use of 38 cc/sec injection rates and intracoronary injection of adenosine. Perfusion area determinations as assessed by planimetry were unaffected by the contrast agent used, the injection rate, or by intracoronary administration of adenosine. We conclude that risk area measurement by the ultrasound contrast technique is not affected by varying contrast agents, injection rates, or vasodilation. However, peak gray level intensity is variable among contrast agents and may result in variability of time-activity curve analysis.\r"

Comparison of the results was then made with a measure of global residual LV function (i.e., score quotient or SQ) derived from segmental scoring of LV wall motion on a two-dimensional echocardiogram (Echo) and with an EF value from a left ventriculogram (LVG), both performed relatively concurrently with MR. Significant (p less than 0.01) overall correlations were noted between MR-EF and both Echo-SQ (r = 0.56) and LVG-EF (r = 0.78), and these relationships were relatively stronger when MI was located in the right coronary artery (RCA) than when it was found in the left anterior descending (LAD) distribution (e.g., MR-EF compared with LVG-EF: r = 0.87, p less than 0.05 for RCA; and r = 0.48, p = NS for LAD). The best expression of relative MI volume appeared to be based upon absolute volume of regionally-thinned LV wall multiplied by a correction factor for its residual contractility and then the addition of a volume correcting for the amount of regional wall thinning by necrosis (i.e., \"total-Fxn\" MI volume).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Between 1975 and 1981, there was a slight increase in the age-adjusted attack rates of acute MI; between 1981 and 1984, however, there was a dramatic decline in the incidence rates of acute MI. These temporal trends over the 10-year period examined resulted in an overall decrease in both the incidence rates of initial (255 per 100,000-1975; 186 per 100,000-1984) as well as recurrent (133 per 100,000-1975; 104 per 100,000-1984) acute MI in the 16 hospitals surveyed. The age-adjusted in-hospital case fatality rates of acute MI declined consistently over the periods studied, from 22.2% in 1975 to 20.3% in 1978, 17.8% in 1981, and to 15.1% in 1984, for an overall decline of 32% over the 10-year period studied. No significant differences, however, were seen in the long-term survival rates of patients discharged from the hospital after acute MI in either 1975, 1978, 1981, or 1984. A consistent decline was seen in the age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000) of out-of-hospital coronary heart disease between 1975 (265), 1978 (174), 1981 (170), and 1984 (148).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute cardiac findings consisted of chest pain in nine patients, compatible ECGs and elevated creatine kinase levels in 10, positive MB fractions in eight, and regional wall motion abnormalities in eight. Acutely, the left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 55% in six patients; ventricular ectopy occurred in five patients, bundle branch block in four, transient junctional escape rhythm in three, and congestive heart failure in three. Among the nine patients followed-up for 1 to 14 months there was one death, five patients had normal results of exercise tests, and three had normal coronary angiograms. Wall motion abnormalities persisted in four patients; ejection fraction improved in five and was less than 55% in three. These findings suggest that focal myocardial damage may occur during acute viral myocarditis and mimic acute myocardial infarction resulting from atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.\r"

All patients had greater than or equal to 50% stenoses of greater than or equal to one coronary artery; 16 had type II morphology, and 33 did not. Type II morphology was more prevalent in patients without inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (11 of 22 or 50%) than in those with it (five of 27 or 19%), p less than 0.05, and patients without akinetic or dyskinetic segments (eight of 14 or 57%) than in those with them (eight of 34 or 24%), p less than 0.06. Thus type II morphology is more prevalent in patients without a demonstrable anatomic and/or electrophysiologic substrate for reentrant ventricular tachycardia, indirectly implicating ruptured plaques in the pathogenesis of cardiac arrest in this subset of patients.\r"

To assess the tolerance and efficacy of these agents, 32 patients presenting with either ventricular fibrillation (18) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (14) were studied during BB therapy. Left ventricular dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 29%) was present as a consequence of coronary artery disease (26) or cardiomyopathy (6). Baseline arrhythmia assessment revealed recurrent ventricular tachycardia in all patients. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy including BB was guided by programmed stimulation (10), exercise testing (8), ambulatory monitoring (12), or was given empirically (2). Beta blockers were well tolerated, as measured by exercise duration, which improved significantly, and by long-term maintenance, which continued in 23 of 32 (72%) patients. Over a mean follow-up of 668 days, patients treated with BB had a relatively low incidence of both sudden (3%) and nonsudden (9%) death. Thus, BB can be effective and well tolerated adjunct therapy in patients with a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the setting of impaired left ventricular function.\r"

Thus in patients with chronic heart failure resulting from either chronic coronary artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy, resting coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption tend to increase probably because of an increase in myocardial oxygen requirements. Silent myocardial ischemia may also occur in both the presence and absence of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic heart failure. The abnormal coronary hemodynamics and myocardial metabolic function may play a role in causing progressive deterioration in cardiac function in dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular late potentials at the end of the surface QRS, detected on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) have been shown to be markers for spontaneous and/or inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We examined the correlations between electrophysiologic study (EPS) findings and SAECG indexes in 50 patients with chronic CAD with documented spontaneous VT/ventricular fibrillation (VF), who had either syncope (24 patients) or aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD). The prevalence of late potentials was significantly higher in the syncope patients (75%) compared with the SCD group (46%) (p less than 0.05). No correlation was found between the ventricular refractoriness and the SAECG indexes. There was a significant difference in quantitative SAECG indexes comparing the induction mode of the sustained VT/VF by single and double versus triple extrastimuli; the types of the induced VT (sustained monomorphic, sustained pleomorphic or VF, noninducible); and the cycle length of the induced sustained monomorphic VT with the high frequency QRS duration (QRSD). In conclusion, differences in prevalence and characteristics of ventricular late potentials were found between patients with syncope and with SCD. The degree of abnormality of SAECG indexes correlated with the type and the mode of induction of sustained VT. The magnitude of QRSD of the SAECG correlated with the cycle length of monomorphic VT. The above findings suggest that in patients with CAD and sustained VT/VF the SAECG variables are related to the area of reentry.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous lorcainide and lidocaine were administered to 25 patients with symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias in a randomized single-blind crossover study. Prior to drug therapy, each patient underwent 48 hours of ambulatory monitoring and exercise testing on a motorized treadmill. At the completion of baseline studies, patients were randomized to receive either lidocaine or lorcainide intravenously. The dose of lidocaine was 1.0 mg/kg by bolus followed by an infusion of 2 to 3 mg/min. The dose of lorcainide was 2.0 mg/kg followed by a constant infusion of 200 to 300 mg over 24 hours. Two patients developed side effects on lidocaine and the infusion was discontinued prior to evaluation of efficacy. Of the remaining 23 patients, 11 (48%) had their arrhythmia controlled, defined as a greater than 90% reduction in repetitive forms (couplets and ventricular tachycardia) and a 50% reduction in ventricular premature beats. Lorcainide was effective in 8 of the 25 patients (32%). There was no correlation between the effect of lidocaine and the response to lorcainide (p = NS). Oral lorcainide therapy was administered to 17 patients who were free of side effects during the intravenous infusion. The oral drug was effective in nine patients (53%), five of whom had responded to the intravenous drug, and was ineffective in eight, seven of whom were also unresponsive to intravenous lorcainide. The intravenous drug predicted the response to the oral form in 71% of patients, but this was not statistically significant. Side effects occurred in 10 patients (59%) and were primarily neurologic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Factors that could influence the heart rhythm immediately after defibrillation were also analyzed. The postdefibrillation heart rate and the duration of postdefibrillation asystole did not correlate with age, conduction abnormalities, type or duration of arrhythmia before defibrillation, delivered energy, lead system, or left ventricular ejection fraction, but they did correlate with the resting preoperative heart rate and the concomitant performance of coronary artery bypass surgery at the time of defibrillator implantation. Temporary pacing (for prolonged asystole) was required in only two patients, both of whom had also undergone bypass surgery. Fourteen patients being treated with amiodarone had slower resting and postdefibrillation heart rates, but the mean duration of posdefibrillation asystole was similar to that seen in patients not receiving any antiarrhythmic medication. On follow-up, 25 monitored and 178 unmonitored automatic defibrillator discharges occurred in 24 patients, without evidence of symptomatic postdefibrillation bradyarrhythmias. Thus significant postdefibrillation bradyarrhythmias were uncommon, but when such a propensity existed it could not be predicted reliably on clinical grounds alone.\r"

  ".W": "The physiologic role of the right ventricle has long been a subject of interest to physiologists. The Fontan operation provides a human model for studying the circulation in series devoid of a subpulmonic right ventricle. The hemodynamic response to isotonic exercise in this setting has been established, and differs appreciably from normal. However, the physiologic response to an increase in heart rate (atrial pacing) as an isolated variable has not been examined and compared to atrial pacing in hearts with two concordant subarterial ventricles. Accordingly, we compared the supine bicycle exercise response to rate-equivalent right atrial pacing in nine patients after atriopulmonary anastomoses (the Fontan operation) for single ventricle or tricuspid atresia. Cardiac index increased 77% with exercise (rest 2.6 L/min/m2; exercise 4.6 L/min/m2) but decreased 12% with atrial pacing (rest 2.5 L/min/m2; pacing 2.2 L/min/m2). Pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation declined significantly during exercise (rest 68%; exercise 31%) and during atrial pacing (control 72%; pacing 64%). The mean increment in pulmonary arterial pressure was 1.3 times greater with exercise (rest 14 mm Hg; exercise 20 mm Hg) than with pacing (control 12 mm Hg; pacing 16 mm Hg). Peak systemic arterial systolic pressure increased 14% with exercise but was unchanged by pacing. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances fell with exercise but changed insignificantly during atrial pacing. Stroke volume rose slightly with exercise but fell significantly with pacing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The echocardiographic degree of mitral valve prolapse was measured by a scoring system that incorporates an assessment of mitral systolic displacement from the M-mode as well as the two-dimensional long-axis and apical four-chamber views (range 0 to 9, 0 = no mitral valve prolapse). A structured questionnaire was used to record the frequency and severity of symptoms. Pulsed and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography were performed to document mitral regurgitation and determine the ratio of peak early to atrial diastolic filling velocities. Patients were grouped according to the degree of mitral valve prolapse; 45 patients had no echocardiographic evidence of mitral valve prolapse. There was no statistically significant relationship between the mitral valve prolapse score and symptoms or left ventricular systolic or diastolic function. There was, however, a strong relationship between the echocardiographic degree of mitral valve prolapse and the presence of significant mitral regurgitation. Patients without echocardiographic evidence of mitral valve prolapse had a 4% incidence of mitral regurgitation, which was not significantly different than that of persons with mild degrees of prolapse (6%). However, the groups with the most marked degree of prolapse (scores of 6, 7, 8, and 9) had a significantly higher incidence of mitral regurgitation (20% and 60% respectively, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During 30 years of follow-up, the incidence of cardiac failure doubled with each decade of age with a male predominance produced by higher rates of coronary heart disease. Most cardiac failure was associated with hypertension or coronary heart disease. Among 232 men and 229 women in whom cardiac failure developed, sudden death occurred at nine times the general age-adjusted population rate. Cardiac failure alone increased the risk of sudden death fivefold. In those who also had coronary heart disease there was a further doubling of risk. The major predisposing factors for cardiac failure included hypertension, obesity, glucose intolerance, heavy smoking, cardiac enlargement, ECG abnormality, and atrial fibrillation. These were also risk factors for sudden death. These shared modifiable risk factors and cardiac impairments did not entirely account for the markedly increased risk of sudden death in cardiac failure. This suggest that either the damaged myocardium or treatment needed to control the cardiac failure may be at fault.\r"

The association between collateral indexes and 8 anatomic and clinical variables was assessed. A reduction in luminal diameter by greater than or equal to 70% predicted angiographically demonstrable collaterals with 100% specificity and 85% sensitivity. Lesion severity (stenosis) correlated with both collateral class and DCOP/Pao: DCOP/Pao = 2.8809 - 0.0729 X stenosis + 0.00049 X stenosis. The data suggest a quantitative relation between lesion severity and collateral development beyond a threshold value of 70% stenosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction during ischemia caused by balloon occlusion (EFo) was found to be primarily determined by lesion location; however, collateral flow modified EFo significantly. For mid-left anterior descending and right coronary artery: EFo = 59 + 26 X (DCOP/Pao); for proximal left anterior descending artery: EFo = 24 + 89 X (DCOP/Pao). A model predicting the hemodynamic and clinical consequences of abrupt coronary closure based on lesion location and severity was developed. In the second study phase, this model was tested retrospectively in a different group of 23 patients who experienced coronary occlusion as a complication of angioplasty. The data of both study phases suggest that left ventricular function and clinical outcome after abrupt coronary closure are determined by an interaction between location of the coronary artery obstruction and the amount of collateral flow. Lesion severity and the extent of functional impairment resulting from abrupt coronary closure are inversely related.\r"

A bicycle ergometer exercise test was performed 3 and 10 hours after dosing. In comparison with placebo, felodipine 5 and 10 mg significantly increased resting heart rate and decreased resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure 3 hours after administration (p less than 0.001). Ten hours after administration, only supine systolic blood pressure was still significantly lower (p less than 0.001). Anginal (time to mild chest pain) and ischemic (time to 1 mm ST depression) thresholds, as well as duration of exercise and total work at peak exercise, were higher in comparison with placebo at 3 and 10 hours (p less than 0.001). In comparison with the lower dose, 10 mg felodipine induced a decrease in supine (p less than 0.05) and sitting (p less than 0.01) systolic blood pressure at rest and an increase in total work to anginal threshold (p less than 0.01), as well as in total work and duration of exercise at peak exercise (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that a single administration of felodipine, 5 and 10 mg, may improve exercise capacity over a 10-hour period in patients with stable exercise-induced angina due to atherosclerotic heart disease.\r"

An assessment of the reliability of the 2 types of measurements was made by correlating them with the physiologic parameters of both segmental wall motion and global ejection fraction response induced by atrial pacing. Digitally acquired coronary angiograms were used to facilitate quantitative analysis. Measurements by edge detection and videodensitometry correlated closely (r = 0.94). Percent diameter narrowing correlated moderately with the change in ejection fraction (r = -0.41) or with the change in segmental wall motion (r = -0.44). The measurement of minimal lumen diameter correlated with the change in global ejection fraction (r = 0.61) and did so even better with the change in segmental wall motion (r = 0.78, p less than 0.05). A minimal lumen diameter of less than or equal to 1.5 mm identified patients likely to have a functional impairment during atrial pacing as assessed by either global ejection fraction or segmental wall motion defects. We conclude that minimal coronary luminal diameter provides a better method than percent diameter narrowing calculations to measure the anatomic severity of coronary artery narrowing.\r"

This study was performed to identify a subset of those criteria with cumulative specificity greater than or equal to 95% and maximal sensitivity for use in screening for the presence of non-acute MI. Coronary angiography and left ventriculography were used to identify 500 normal subjects, 60 patients with isolated anterior MI and 62 patients with isolated inferior MI. Patients with the QRS confounding factors of ventricular hypertrophy, fascicular block or bundle branch block on their electrocardiogram were not included. Using stepwise logistic regression analysis, the screening criteria identified were: (1) Q greater than or equal to 30 ms in aVF, (2) R less than or equal to 10 ms and less than or equal to 0.1 mV in V2 and (3) R greater than or equal to 40 ms in V1. Cumulatively, these 3 screening criteria achieved 84% and 77% sensitivities for inferior and anterior MI groups, respectively. Thus, a set of 3 criteria from the Selvester QRS scoring system is capable of identifying single non-acute anterior or inferior MI in 80% of patients, and falsely indicating presence of MI in only 5% of normal subjects.\r"

This study examined the ECGs of 438 patients (105 normal subjects, 161 with \"possible\" MI and 172 with \"definite\" MI based on data from cardiac catheterization) to develop software for an automated method of the Selvester system in attempts to overcome the manual constraints. After a comprehensive validation process involving extensive interactions between the manual scorer and the software developer, an automated method of the Selvester system was generated that had a high correlation with manual application (r = 0.94) and was superior regarding time, training, reader bias, reproducibility and precision of measurement. These results indicate that an automated version of the Selvester QRS scoring system would resolve many of the limitations of manual application and would provide a reliable, technically accurate estimate of MI size that could be incorporated into ECG diagnostic programs and used in standard digital ECG machines.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 313 consecutive patients was studied to assess the prevalence and prognostic implications of Q-wave loss after transmural acute myocardial infarction. Heart catheterization, including single-plane left ventriculography and selective coronary arteriography, was performed before hospital discharge. After a mean follow-up of 65 (1 to 100) months, 34 patients (11%) lost their Q waves. The time interval from the acute event to the first electrocardiogram showing Q-wave disappearance was 14 (1 to 32) months. Peak creatine kinase value was significantly higher in patients who retained their Q waves than in those who lost them (1,121 +/- 813 vs 779 +/- 464 IU, respectively, p less than 0.05). Severity of coronary artery disease, as judged by the number of diseased arteries and the number of arteries with total or subtotal occlusion, was similar in both groups. However, patients showing Q-wave regression had lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, higher ejection fraction and fewer abnormally contracting segments than their counterparts (12 +/- 6 vs 15 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.05; 53 +/- 11 vs 44 +/- 14%, p less than 0.001; 1 +/- 1 vs 2 +/- 1 segments, p less than 0.001, respectively). In addition, no patient with normalized electrocardiogram presented with left ventricular aneurysm. Although differences in mortality, nonfatal reinfarction and new onset of angina between the 2 groups were not significant, congestive heart failure was prevalent among patients with permanent Q waves (23 vs 6%, p less than 0.05). Our findings suggest that Q-wave loss after AMI may be related to a smaller infarct size.\r"

To achieve this goal, a nonstandard protocol was used: contrast ventriculography was performed at rest and immediately following 3 minutes of supine bicycle exercise at 50 watts. Wall motion in the infarct and noninfarct regions was measured using the centerline method. The global ejection fraction response to exercise correlated poorly with the exercise response of motion in the infarct region (r = 0.38). In 15 of the 24 patients, the function of the infarct and noninfarct regions changed in opposing directions, and in only 8 (53%) of these did the global ejection fraction response follow the exercise response of motion in the infarct region. The motion of the noninfarct region was the predominant influence on the ejection fraction response in the other 7 patients. Subgroup analysis revealed that the global ejection fraction response was more dependent on the response of motion in the anterior wall (r = 0.71, p less than 0.001) than in the inferior wall (r = 0.16), regardless of infarct location. The regional wall motion response to exercise also better distinguished reperfused from nonreperfused patients than did the ejection fraction response. These results indicate that the global ejection fraction response to exercise may be an unreliable indicator of the functional status of the infarct region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The decision to administer thrombolytic therapy for limitation of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) size must occur when only the history, physical examination and 12-lead electrocardiogram of a patient are available. A method that could quickly assess the amount of jeopardized myocardium would greatly aid the physician. This study developed formulas from 68 anterior and 80 inferior AMI patients using the extent of initial ST-segment deviation (ST delta) to predict the final AMI size estimated by the Selvester QRS score in a population not receiving reperfusion therapy. Inclusion required: initial anterior or inferior AMI; admission electrocardiogram less than or equal to 8 hours after the onset of symptoms with evidence of epicardial injury; elevated creatine kinase-MB; a predischarge electrocardiogram taken greater than or equal to 72 hours after admission; and no AMI extension before the predischarge electrocardiogram. The extent of epicardial injury was quantified by counting the number of leads with greater than or equal to 0.1 mm ST delta, by the sum (sigma) of ST delta in all leads and by the sigma ST delta in the lead groups associated with each AMI location. These results were compared to the AMI size estimated from the predischarge electrocardiogram. Univariable and multivariable analyses generated these formulas for AMI size: anterior = 3[1.5 (number leads ST increases) - 0.4]; inferior = 3[0.6 (sigma ST increases II, III, aVF) + 2.0]. Thus, formulas based on quantitative measurements of ST delta on the admission electrocardiogram are predictive of final QRS-estimated AMI size, and may be useful in determining the efficacy of acute reperfusion therapy.\r"

The present study reviewed 507 consecutive patients in whom creatine kinase, creatine kinase isoenzymes, LD and LD isoenzymes were ordered over a 1-month period. Of these, 249 had an insufficient number of serial enzyme determinations to establish a laboratory diagnosis of AMI. After excluding an additional 11 patients for other reasons, 247 patients remained for analysis. Of these, only 2 (0.8%) had myocardial infarction by standard clinical criteria with normal creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB but elevated LD and abnormal LD isoenzymes. Seven patients (7 of 247, 2.8%) had false-positive LD isoenzymes. Thus, the routine use of LD and LD isoenzymes was of no use in most patients (96%) and led to the incorrect diagnosis of AMI more than 3 times as often as it helped with a correct diagnosis. Total 1-month charges for all the LD and LD isoenzymes obtained equalled +42,450. Therefore, it appears that LD and LD isoenzymes are not routinely useful in the diagnosis of AMI and may result in considerable unnecessary expense. It is suggested that LD and LD isoenzymes be ordered only under suspicion of late presentation (greater than 48 hours) of AMI.\r"

Evaluation of drug effect consisted of acute testing with 125 mg followed by a period of maintenance therapy. Efficacy, as evaluated with both ambulatory monitoring and exercise testing, was defined as total elimination of runs of ventricular tachycardia, greater than 90% reduction in couplets and greater than 50% decrease in ventricular premature complex. During acute drug testing 9 of the 16 patients responded to the drug. Four patients did not receive maintenance therapy with indecainide, because of toxic side effects. Of the remaining 12 patients, 7 responded to indecainide based on monitoring, 5 responded judged by exercise testing and 4 when both monitoring and exercise testing were considered. There was no correlation between dose, blood level of drug and effect on arrhythmia. In this small group acute drug testing did not appear to predict the response to the drug during maintenance therapy. Neurologic side effects were reported by 5 patients. Aggravation of arrhythmia occurred in 5 patients, 3 of whom had this complication during acute drug testing and 2 during maintenance therapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction, measured before and during therapy, decreased from an average of 43% to 35% (p less than 0.005). A reduction was observed irrespective of baseline left ventricular function. Indecainide is an effective antiarrhythmic agent in a small number of highly selected patients with serious ventricular arrhythmia, but potentially serious side effects limit its usefulness.\r"

The fragmentation pattern most often consists of a double spike. To further assess double-spike electrograms as a possible marker of conduction delay, bipolar electrograms were continuously recorded during atrial overdrive pacing of common flutter from the right atrium (7 patients) and from the proximal coronary sinus (5). Baseline double-spike separation of 50 to 130 ms was unchanged in 1 patient and slightly increased (5 to 25 ms) in 4 by coronary sinus pacing. The electrogram sequence was unchanged and the surface morphology was similar to that of basal flutter. Right atrial pacing decreased double-spike separation by 25 to 85 ms from basal values of 45 to 175 ms (23 to 83%), suggesting fusion in the area of fragmented electrograms. These findings suggest that double-spike electrograms represent activation on both sides of a conduction delay zone. The changes induced in these electrograms by pacing from the anterior right atrium and the coronary sinus are consistent with flutter circuits rotating counterclockwise (frontal plane) in the posterior right atrial wall in common atrial flutter.\r"

The phenomenon occurred in 34 of 38 episodes of tachycardia during autodecremental atrial stimulation. It was not seen in 4 episodes because the first impulse penetrating the circuit terminated the arrhythmia. Invariably, the HH and VV intervals were not equal to, but longer than, the stimulus-stimulus intervals, thus not fulfilling the definition of \"classic\" (constant cycle length) entrainment postulated by Okumura et al. Furthermore, the first 2 of the 3 diagnostic criteria were not demonstrated and the third only could be demonstrated in 7 episodes. Tachycardia termination was achieved in all 38 episodes. Entrainment occurred during autodecremental ventricular stimulation in 79 of 80 episodes, with the AA and H-H- intervals (when visible) being equal to the corresponding paced cycle lengths. Moreover, the intervals between the last paced ventricular beat and the first ventricular beat of the resumed tachycardia were invariably longer than the last stimulus-stimulus intervals. These characteristics were those which Okumura et al attributed to \"concealed\" entrainment. Tachycardia termination was achieved in 77 of 80 episodes. In summary: (1) autodecremental atrial pacing produced a specific form of entrainment that did not fulfill the \"classic\" definition of Okumura et al; (2) autodecremental ventricular pacing consistently produced \"concealed\" entrainment; and (3) autodecremental stimulation was very effective in terminating 115 of 118 (98%) of episodes of circus movement tachycardias.\r"

Ventricular fibrillation was induced 5 times in 5 patients and atrial arrhythmias with a rapid ventricular response occurred during 7 studies in 4 patients. The AED detection algorithm advised \"shock\" during 36 of 55 (65%) episodes of sustained VT and all 5 episodes of ventricular fibrillation. The device correctly advised \"shock\" for all 6 episodes of nonsustained VT that spontaneously terminated after analysis was complete. Thus, the sensitivity of the device for all ventricular arrhythmias analyzed was 47 of 66 (71%). The device recommended \"shock\" for all 31 episodes of rapid VT and 1 of 2 episodes of atrial fibrillation associated with systemic hypotension (32 of 33, 97%). The 19 episodes of VT for which \"no shock\" was advised were comparatively slow and were hemodynamically well tolerated. The device recommended \"no shock\" during all 21 episodes of normal sinus rhythm and all 20 episodes of rapid atrial pacing (cycle length 400 ms) analyzed. \"No shock\" was advised during 4 episodes of sustained narrow QRS complex supraventricular tachycardia and 4 brief episodes of nonsustained VT that terminated before analysis was complete.

In this group of 161 patients there was a total of 57 deaths, of which 35 (63%) were sudden. Life-table analysis demonstrated a 10% sudden death rate for all patients in the first year and a 7% annual rate in the subsequent 4 years. In patients managed noninvasively, the overall mortality rate was 27% over 9 years, or 3% per year. Suppression of ventricular tachycardia on both ambulatory monitoring and exercise testing was associated with improved survival. In patients evaluated by electrophysiologic testing the sudden death rate was 1.4% per year over an average of 5 years. This survival rate was not different compared with the noninvasive group (p = 0.09). Measures of left ventricular dysfunction and the frequency of ventricular arrhythmia before and after drug therapy were associated with a risk of sudden cardiac death by univariate analysis. Multivariate regression analysis identified 4 variables as independent predictors of sudden cardiac death: rales (p = 0.009), the number of runs of VT during exercise testing while receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy (p = 0.0003), a history of congestive heart failure (p = 0.0009) and the number of premature beats on Holter monitoring (p = 0.01). These findings support the concept that suppression of repetitive arrhythmia on Holter monitor and exercise testing is a marker for improved survival among patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because both have been shown to alter blood pressure (BP) and its underlying hemodynamic mechanisms, the potential exists for additive or even synergistic effects. Changes in heart rate, BP and noninvasive thoracic impedance measures of left ventricular function were examined in young men (ages 20 to 36) at rest and during a demanding behavioral task performed 40 minutes after predosing with caffeine (3.3 mg/kg, equivalent to 2 to 3 cups of coffee) or placebo in a double-blind crossover design. All subjects were healthy young men without history of cardiovascular disease, regular use of nicotine, recreational or prescription drugs or caffeine intolerance. Caffeine abstinence was required for 12 hours before each test session. Systolic and diastolic BP were elevated by both caffeine and the behavioral task alone (p less than 0.01 for each); when combined, caffeine's pressor effects were additive to those of the behavioral task. However, caffeine's pressor effect was produced by different mechanisms depending on the behavioral state. Caffeine increased systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) under resting conditions, but it enhanced cardiac output (p less than 0.01) during behavioral arousal associated with the task. The combined influence of caffeine and the task increased the number of men in whom peak systolic BP reached hypertensive levels, and also synergistically increased cardiac minute work (p less than 0.01) and the rate-pressure product estimate of myocardial oxygen demand (p less than 0.05). Implications of these findings are discussed for long standing theoretical disputes regarding caffeine, its health consequences, and for methodologic issues in behavioral and clinical studies.\r"

A total of 461 valves (184 Hancock, 131 C-E and 146 I-S) were available for study of the incidence of primary tissue valve failure after 5 to 9 years of follow-up. Cumulative follow-up was 1,016 patient-years for patients with Hancock valve, 688 for the C-E and 767 for the I-S group. Of the 397 prostheses at risk (154 Hancock, 120 C-E and 123 I-S), 36 instances of primary tissue valve failure occurred (12 Hancock, 7 C-E and 17 I-S). On an actuarial basis, the calculated probability of freedom from primary tissue valve failure was 88 +/- 4% for the Hancock group, 87 +/- 6% for the C-E and 51 +/- 17% for the I-S at 9 years. The linear incidence of tissue valve failure was 1.2 failing valves per 100 patient-years for the Hancock group, 1 for the C-E and 2.2 for the I-S. In a cohort of patients older than 40 years of age at the time of valve replacement, the rate of freedom from primary failure was 98 +/- 1%, 87 +/- 9% and 44 +/- 22% for the Hancock, C-E and I-S groups, respectively, at 9 years. Comparison of actuarial curves disclosed a meaningful difference between the pericardial valve and the Hancock and C-E porcine bioprostheses at 9-year follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, catheterization and Doppler areas before and after valvuloplasty correlated less well (r = 0.51, p less than 0.002 and r = 0.47, p less than 0.005, respectively) than the catheterization-Doppler area correlation in a previous study of 59 consecutive patients with varying degrees of mitral stenosis (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001). Mitral valve area increases were independent of valve thickness estimated using 2-dimensional echocardiography. Flail mitral leaflet movement was not observed and the degree of mitral regurgitation qualitatively assessed using pulsed Doppler mapping techniques increased by greater than 1 of 4 grades in only 1 patient. The lateral mitral valve orifice diameter increased more than the anteroposterior diameter, suggesting commissural splitting as the mechanism of successful valvuloplasty. Increases (all p less than 0.0001) were noted in mitral valve EF slope (7 +/- 5 to 18 +/- 10 mm/s), excursion (11 +/- 5 to 13 +/- 4 mm), S20S interval (0.07 +/- 0.02 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 s) and cardiac output (4.2 +/- 1.3 to 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters/min).

Significant CAD (coronary diameter stenoses greater than 50%) was found in 28 patients (14%). Typical angina was present in 18% and atypical chest pain in 16%. Angina alone had a sensitivity of 57% to detect significant CAD. The predictive accuracy of a positive history of angina was 46% and that of a negative test 93%. By using multivariate logistic regression, a risk score could be calculated that increased the sensitivity to 74% at equal specificity. Almost 40% of the total population had a risk score of less than -2.9 (only 1 patient in this group had CAD). It is concluded that coronary arteriography can safely be omitted in many patients with severe aortic regurgitation if they have no symptoms of myocardial ischemia or risk factors known to increase its incidence.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between nifedipine concentration and hemodynamic effects after sublingual administration of 10 or 20 mg was examined in 13 patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Serum nifedipine concentrations were determined by gas chromatography and were not related to dose. Peripheral vascular resistance decreased as a function of nifedipine concentration (r = -0.63, p less than 0.001); this was associated with a concentration-related increase in heart rate (r = 0.56, p less than 0.001) and in cardiac index (r = 0.50, p less than 0.001). However, evidence for a pure vasodilator effect of nifedipine was inconsistent, in that the change in stroke volume index with nifedipine was not significant. Although stroke volume index increased at nifedipine concentrations between 60 and 120 ng/ml (38 +/- 6 to 42 +/- 4 ml/m2, p less than 0.01), it decreased at concentrations greater than 120 ng/ml (40 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 4 ml/m2, p less than 0.01). Moreover, pulmonary artery wedge pressure increased at nifedipine concentrations greater than 120 ng/ml (11 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), suggesting either depressed left ventricular (LV) systolic function or reduced LV filling. To investigate these possible mechanisms, LV systolic and diastolic function was studied during catheterization with a nonimaging scintillation probe in 6 of the 13 patients. In these subjects, heart rate was held constant by atrial pacing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The modified Bernoulli equation has been used to determine the peak pressure difference across stenotic pulmonary valves. The direction of the poststenotic jet may be eccentric in relation to the axis of the pulmonary artery. Consequently, the maximal velocity obtained from the parasternal transducer position may inaccurately estimate peak pressure difference. Thus, Doppler-derived estimates of pressure difference from the parasternal, subcostal, apical, and suprasternal notch transducer positions were compared with peak-to-peak pulmonary artery to right ventricle catheter withdrawal pressure differences in 24 patients admitted for pulmonary valvuloplasty. Suprasternal, subcostal or apical transducer positions produced higher maximal velocities than the parasternal transducer position in 12 of 24 patients when the studies were performed before cardiac catheterization and in 8 of 12 patients when performed during cardiac catheterization. The Doppler-derived estimates using the highest maximal velocity predicted catheterization pressure difference accurately when the measurements were not performed simultaneously (y = 1.05x - 3.3, r = 0.86, standard error of the estimate +/- 18.7 mm Hg) and the correlation was closer when the measurements were performed simultaneously (y = 1.09x - 2.7, r = 0.97, standard error of the estimate +/- 9.4 mm Hg). The transducer position that yielded the highest maximal velocity in an individual patient was the same before and after valvuloplasty. In all groups, the correlation with pressure at cardiac catheterization was improved by using the highest maximal velocity rather than the parasternal maximal velocity.\r"

Anomalous origin of the right PA was much more common than anomalous origin of the left PA. The anomalous right PA usually arose from the posterior aspect of the ascending aorta close to the aortic valve. Less commonly, it originated from the lateral ascending aorta just proximal to the innominate artery. Patent ductus arteriosus and aorticopulmonary septal defect were commonly associated with anomalous origin of the right PA; other cardiovascular anomalies were rare. In contrast, tetralogy of Fallot and aortic arch anomalies, e.g., right aortic arch and anomalous origin of the subclavian artery, were common in anomalous origin of the left PA. An association with DiGeorge syndrome, frequently noted with persistent truncus arteriosus, was not seen with anomalous origin of a PA from the ascending aorta. The observations indicate that anomalous origin of the right PA and anomalous origin of the left PA are pathogenetically unrelated to each other and both are unrelated to persistent truncus arteriosus. Moreover, anomalous origin of the right PA arising close to the innominate artery is thought to be pathogenetically distinct from the type that arises close to the aortic valve. These pathogenetic relations should be considered in epidemiologic studies of congenital heart disease.\r"

Of that total 32 (88%) had echocardiographic evidence of such an abnormality (29 had a typical subarotic ridge protruding from the crest of the interventricular septum and the remaining 3 had an echodense area in the same location). Surgical confirmation of the presence or absence of a subaortic abnormality was available in 26. There was correlation between the surgical and echocardiographic findings in all patients. A resting Doppler gradient of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg was present in only 10. During the study period, 6 patients had Doppler evidence of progression of their gradient. The incidence of subaortic abnormalities in right ventricular muscle bundles and ventricular septal defects appears to be far greater than previously suspected. The exact significance of this finding in the absence of a pressure gradient is still unclear.\r"

  ".W": "In 14 children who underwent a venous switch operation for complete transposition of the great arteries, exercise testing was performed 3 to 15 years (mean 8) after the operation. Exercise performance capacity was assessed by the determination of the ventilatory threshold during exercise and by the oxygen uptake (VO2) reached at a heart rate of 170 beats/min (VO2,170). The ventilatory threshold was defined as the highest oxygen uptake (VO2) at which the pulmonary ventilation (VE) stops to increase linearly when related to VO2. During exercise above this threshold a disproportionate increase in VE relative to VO2 is observed. The mean ventilatory threshold was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than the normal mean value and averaged 72 +/- 15%, 67 +/- 15% and 70 +/- 13% of the predicted normal value for children of comparable age, weight and height, respectively. The mean value for VO2,170 also was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than the normal mean value for children of comparable age, weight and height, and averaged 81 +/- 20%, 81 +/- 18% and 80 +/- 18%, respectively. Compared with normal control subjects of the same sex and age, the ventilatory threshold was surpassed sooner (p less than 0.001) and reached after 2 +/- 1 min instead of the 4 +/- 1 min required by the controls. In nearly half of the patients, a lower than normal (i.e. below the 95% confidence limit) heart rate response to exercise was observed. Theoretically, this could be interpreted as indicating a normal or high physical performance capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subjects exercised on a treadmill at 69 +/- 1% of maximal O2 uptake until exhaustion (170 +/- 10 minutes). Hemodynamic variables were measured before and 10 minutes after exhausting exercise. Baseline systolic blood pressure decreased from 124 +/- 2 to 113 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) after exhausting exercise. LV end-diastolic diameter, measured by echocardiography, decreased from 51 +/- 1.0 to 47 +/- 1.0 mm (p less than 0.005) but LV end-systolic diameter did not change (34 +/- 1.0 vs 34 +/- 1.0 mm). Both LV fractional shortening and the mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening decreased (33 +/- 1 vs 28 +/- 1%; p less than 0.01 and 1.09 +/- 0.4 vs 0.97 +/- 0.05 circ/s; p less than 0.025) despite a lower end-systolic wall stress (sigma es = 88 +/- 4 vs 82 +/- 5, X 10(3) dynes/cm2; p less than 0.05) after prolonged exhausting exercise. A repeat bout of exercise of the same intensity but brief in duration (10 minutes) resulted in increases in LV fractional shortening (p less than 0.001) and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (p less than 0.001), and a decrease in LV end-diastolic diameter (50 +/- 1.0 to 48 +/- 1.0 mm; p less than 0.05) at heart rates comparable to those attained after prolonged exhausting exercise. The results suggest that prolonged strenuous exercise may result in impaired LV function in healthy young subjects.\r"

Estimates have been based on various QRS- and ST-T-derived parameters, including amplitude sum of ST elevations. Application of the electrodes, commonly 35, is cumbersome and time-consuming with the critically ill. A subset of 5 or 7 selected leads can be applied instead, and the remaining leads calculated from that subset with minimal loss of QRS and ST-T information. Maps were recorded from 100 patients within 72 hours of onset of anterior or lateral infarct. Optimal lead subsets for QRS and ST-T feature extraction were found by the sequential selection method of Lux. Subsets numbering between 2 and 15 leads were derived, with their lead-transform coefficients. Measures to estimate goodness of fit for reconstructed leads included correlations, error-to-signal ratios and root-mean-square errors. These measures were calculated separately over the QRS and ST-T complexes. Reconstructions from a 7-lead subset had a mean 0.92 correlation with ST-T in the original leads and root-mean-square error of only 0.04 mV. Sum of ST elevation differed by only 2% between original leads and reconstructions based on 5 or more leads. To confirm repeatability, lead-transform coefficients were also calculated from a training population of 50 patients and applied to the maps of the other 50.\r"

Familial correlations were computed in pairs of biological relatives and relatives by adoption and used in the path-analysis BETA model to determine the contribution of genetic and nongenetic factors in the familial resemblance observed in energy intake. No significant genetic effect was found for intake of any nutrient tested (h2 less than or equal to 11%) and cultural inheritance was found to be more important than genetic inheritance. Nontransmitted environmental factors, including home environmental effects, were found to account for more than 50% of the variation observed in the energy-intake components. These results suggest that the average genetic influence on nutrient intake is negligible and that nongenetic effects associated mainly with home environmental effects are the major affecters of energy intake.\r"

The diets were isocaloric and similar in proportions of protein, polyunsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio, fiber, and cholesterol. All subjects completed both diets in a crossover experimental design. Fasting blood and 24-h urine samples were collected every other day. No significant differences in plasma luteinizing hormone, progesterone, prolactin, estrone (E1), and estradiol-17 beta (E2) or in urinary E1, E2, and estriol were observed. Prolactin secretion in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation was also unchanged. Dietary fat may influence breast-cancer incidence by modulating the hormonal environment; however, an increase in short-term fat intake from 28 to 51 g/1000 kcal did not lead to substantial differences in the hormonal milieu.\r"

Analysis of 3-d dietary diaries kept by the vegans indicated marginal to adequate intake of protein, carbohydrate, vitamin B-6, methionine, and cystine; inadequate intake of zinc; and negligible intake of taurine. Prolonged absence of dietary taurine intake causes decreased plasma taurine and severely restricted urinary taurine output.\r"

The purpose of this work was to study the role of TBPA-retinol-binding-protein (RBP)-retinol complex changes in the elevation of serum TBPA in HD patients. Serum TBPA, RBP, and retinol were measured in 30 otherwise healthy HD patients (15 men, 15 women) and in 30 healthy volunteers (15 men, 15 women). The dependence of TBPA on RBP was studied by covariance and regression methods. TBPA (p less than 0.05), RBP (p less than 0.01), and retinol (p less than 0.05) were elevated in HD patients. Elevated TBPA was associated with a decrease of TBPA free from RBP (p less than 0.01). The decrease of free TBPA may explain the reduction of TBPA breakdown and its elevation in HD patients.\r"

  ".W": "In 1965 within the Zutphen Study information on several possible determinants of body fatness (eg, energy intake, energy expenditure, alcohol intake, coffee consumption, tea consumption, and smoking) was collected. Univariate analyses showed that for 525 men aged 45-64 y and free from cardiovascular diseases, indicators of body fatness were inversely related to the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, smoking, and coffee consumption. Alcohol intake was directly related to Quetelet index, and tea consumption was not related to indicators of body fatness. Inverse associations between indicators of body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure, physical activity per kilogram body weight, and smoking were confirmed in multivariate analyses. The inverse association between body fatness and the difference between energy intake and expenditure may be due to the underestimation of energy intake by obese subjects. In lean people this association may be explained by a thermogenic effect of smoking.\r"

Significant differences in caloric intake were observed between load conditions with the fructose group consuming fewer calories than the glucose group. Obese subjects demonstrated significantly greater insulin responses to the preload compared with lean subjects, and insulin levels of obese subjects at 15, 30, and 45 min after preload were found to correlate significantly with amount consumed. Incorporation of fructose or glucose into a mixed meal format in study 2 revealed no differences in subsequent caloric intake as a function of either type of preload or percent overweight. Differing insulin levels are discussed as a possible mechanism for differential food intake.\r"

We demonstrate that correction of the deficiency occurs after intramuscular administration of a water-miscible solution of retinyl palmitate (100,000 IU, or 30 mg retinol equivalent). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of vitamin A injections on liver and blood concentrations in nine children with chronic cholestasis over a 1-y period.

Absorption was measured by the standard double-isotope method in which both the test food and the miscible Ca pool are labeled with different Ca tracers. Measurement of both Ca and oxalate in our test spinach revealed a very slight stoichiometric excess of oxalate; hence it is likely that all of the spinach Ca was effectively bound. Absorption was higher from milk in every case, with the mean absorption from milk averaging 27.6% and from spinach, 5.1%. The mean within-subject difference between Ca absorption from milk and from spinach was 22.5 +/- 9.5% (P less than 0.0001). These results conclusively establish that spinach Ca is much less readily available than milk Ca.\r"

Growth was evaluated with anthropometric indices 1 mo before and 1 mo after onset of Cu supplementation of 80 micrograms.kg-1.d-1. Plasma Cu and ceruloplasmin rose significantly after 1 mo of supplementation. Weight-for-age and weight-for-length indices increased significantly after supplementation only in the Cu-deficient group. Daily energy intake was significantly higher in the Cu-deficient group after supplementation than it was in the control group. Daily weight gain after supplementation increased significantly in the Cu-deficient group and the value for daily weight gain after supplementation was significantly higher than that of the control group for the equivalent amount of time. Cu supplementation improves the growth of Cu-deficient infants recovering from malnutrition.\r"

The diets contained approximately 62 g protein (11.6% of the calories), 392 g carbohydrate (73.3% of the calories), and 20.9 g fat (8.6% of the calories) and a mean of 24 g neutral detergent fiber. Although anthropometric measurements indicated that the mothers had mild protein malnutrition and inadequate energy reserves, their infants exhibited low-normal weight and length for age. All the mothers had hepatitis A antibodies; 92% had tropical eosinophilia, indicating intestinal parasites; 16% had cheilosis and angular stomatitis, indicating a possible B-vitamin deficiency; and 8% had elevated urinary nitrite, indicating urinary tract infection. There were no unusual physical findings on the infants. Although the children appeared healthy, the mothers showed evidence of multiple infections and possible nutrient deficiencies.\r"

The Nepalese mothers consumed significantly more Cu, significantly less Fe and Se, and similar amounts of Zn as compared with American lactating women. Blood Fe status indices and plasma concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Se were lower in the Nepalese mothers than in the American mothers. These lower values may in part be related to the high neutral detergent fiber and phytate content of the Nepalese diet, which could make these minerals less available for absorption. The high exposure to infections in Nepal may also depress Fe status indices and plasma Zn concentrations. The lower dietary Se intake of the Nepalese mothers was reflected in lower milk concentrations.\r"

Both antibodies have excellent signal-to-noise ratios, and specifically react with simple epithelia, transitional epithelia, mesothelia and tumors derived from such tissues, making them superior immunological reagents. They do not react with neural, muscle, hematopoietic, connective or most epidermal tissues.

An additional 45 cases of colonic lesions (15 adenomas and 30 adenocarcinomas) were also examined as the corresponding controls. Arachis hypogaea agglutinin (PNA) bound selectively to the neoplastic cells of adenocarcinomas in the appendix and colon, but in contrast, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) binding activity was observed in both normal mucosa and adenomas, and in appendiceal hyperplasia. The fact that one case each of appendiceal adenoma and colonic villous adenoma showed a diffuse positive reactivity with PNA, which was comparable with similar binding in the adenocarcinoma cases, may suggest development of a malignant behavior prior to the histologic expression of malignant transformation in the appendiceal mucocele.\r"

To determine the efficacy of cytopathology in identifying Barrett esophagus and related neoplasia, observations were compared on 150 esophageal cytology samples with concurrent endoscopic biopsy specimens. Sixty-six specimens that contained benign columnar epithelium in either cytologic or biopsy material were identified. Distinctive-type Barrett mucosa with incomplete intestinalization, considered diagnostic of Barrett esophagus, was found in 34 of 66 cases (52%) and was present only in cytologic material in 11 cases. Twenty-two specimens contained cardiac-type mucosa (present only in cytology in ten cases), a finding of uncertain significance due to lack of localization of the sample with respect to the gastroesophageal junction. Fundic-type mucosa was not observed in any specimen. Two cases of distinctive-type Barrett mucosa with columnar epithelial dysplasia were identified in both biopsy and cytology specimens. Among eight Barrett-associated carcinomas (seven adenocarcinomas and one squamous), cytologic material was diagnostic for malignancy in seven and highly suspicious in one. It was concluded that cytopathologic studies are a useful adjunct to biopsy histopathology in the diagnosis of Barrett esophagus and associated carcinoma. The role of cytopathology in the diagnosis of Barrett-related columnar epithelial dysplasia requires further study, and at present a cautious approach with biopsy confirmation is recommended.\r"

Of 55 cases suggestive but not diagnostic of HPV infection, 13% were antigen-positive and 26% were mRNA positive. Negative results were obtained in all lesions not believed to be indicative of HPV infection by morphologic criteria. In mRNA positive diagnostic cases, two thirds were of HPV type 6 and one third were HPV type 11. Two cases of coinfection with HPV types 6 and 16 were found.

For that reason, we have evaluated the interference by HC II in the new DuPont aca antithrombin assay. Response of the assay to purified AT-III and HC II was compared. Inhibition of the bovine thrombin in the assay was sixfold less per molecule of HC II than of AT-III. This level of selectivity should be adequate to prevent misdiagnosis of patients. Analysis of patient samples showed close correlation (r = 0.91) of values from the automated aca assay with those of a manual assay (Coatest antithrombin, Helena Laboratories).\r"

An IVP is generally advocated in cases where greater than 5-10 red blood cells per high power field (RBC/HPF) are identified. Various laboratories have advocated the use of dipstick examination of these urine specimens as a replacement for microscopic examination. Urine specimens from 178 consecutive patients with blunt abdominal injury were evaluated by dipstick (Chemstrip 9, Cat. No. 417190, Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics) and microscopic examination. Sensitivity of dipstick testing for microscopic hematuria was 100% as compared to microscopic examination (positive greater than or equal to 5RBC/HPF); specificity was 58.6%. Predictive value of a positive test (PVP) was 60.8%; predictive value of a negative test (PVN) was 100%. Evaluation of proteinuria performed as an additional means of assessing renal integrity was found to be less sensitive, but more specific than, dipstick evaluation of hematuria. Poor correlation was seen between the degree of positivity by dipstick testing and the actual degree of microscopic hematuria. It is concluded that specimens which are negative for hematuria by dipstick do not need further testing by microscopic examination. All specimens which contain blood by dipstick evaluation need to be examined microscopically to predict the need for IVP.\r"

The case presented in this report is that of a 43-year-old man who had no evidence of neurofibromatosis, and developed a benign schwannoma that contained multiple well formed gland-like structures. The cells lining the glands, when examined ultrastructurally and histochemically, proved to be Schwann cells, a unique finding that may provide a clue to the histogenesis of the glandular schwannoma.\r"

The silicotic nature of the crystals was confirmed using energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis. There was no evidence of a mycobacterial, fungal, or other etiology for the granulomas. This case demonstrates that coal workers' pneumoconiosis should be added to the differential diagnosis of bone marrow granulomas and that marrow examination may be a source of tissue for documentation of specific occupational exposures.\r"

Nevertheless, three organs may still be studied in macerated fetuses: the lungs (where different glandular, canalar, and alveolar stages of development are evident), the kidneys (where the respective numbers of rows of primitive glomeruli and of generations of mature glomeruli vary after week 22), and the adrenal glands (where neuroblastic nests are normally found between weeks 7 and 26 of gestation).

In one case, a good therapeutic response was followed by partial remission of the renal alterations, but 10 months later there were clinical and histological signs of active glomerular nephropathy, suggesting that the antigenic stimulus persisted. In another case, poor evolution of the infection was accompanied by clinically and histologically aggressive glomerular nephropathy, and advanced renal failure. The third patient, who had diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, underwent renal biopsy earlier than the other two cases, and the behavior of the nephropathy has not been aggressive to date. Immunohistopathologic study revealed a diffuse granular deposit of IgM and C3 in all three cases; the first two also presented a discrete linear IgG deposit in the capillary loops. Attempts to identify C burnetii antigen at the glomerular level by immunohistologic techniques failed in two patients. The literature on the association of chronic Q fever with glomerulonephritis is briefly reviewed.\r"

Its use is frequently limited by the development of nephrotoxicity, including renal vasoconstriction with depressed glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF), inability to concentrate the urine, and renal potassium wasting. We investigated the effects of oral NaCl loading during chronic administration of AMPHO, on renal function in the rat. Rats were provided 150 mmol/L NaCl (AMPHO plus NaCl) or tap water (AMPHO plus H2O) as drinking water, 3 days prior to, and during chronic AMPHO (5 mg/kg/d intraperitoneal [IP] for 21 days). At the end of the experimental period, renal functional parameters were determined, including serum creatinine, urinary volume and electrolyte excretion rates, ability to maximally concentrate the urine after water deprivation, and renal hemodynamics. NaCl supplementation prevented the rise in serum creatinine (AMPHO plus NaCl, initial v final, 0.39 +/- 0.03 v 0.40 +/- 0.03 mg/dL [34.6 +/- 2.7 v 35.4 +/- 2.7 mumol/L], P = NS) seen in AMPHO plus H2O (0.34 +/- 0.01 v 0.51 +/- 0.04 mg/dL [30.0 +/- 0.9 v 45.2 +/- 3.5 mumol/L], P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Despite the frequency and morbidity of nephrolithiasis in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), this association has not been subject to a detailed study. One hundred fifty-one of 751 ADPKD patients seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1976 and 1986 had nephrolithiasis. Seventy-four had passed calculi or had stones surgically removed. Stone analysis was available in 30 patients: uric acid, calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and struvite were present in 56.6%, 46.6%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. Calculi were observed in 71 of 79 patients with excretory urograms available for review. Faintly opaque and bull's eye stones, probably containing uric acid, were present in 12.7% and 14.1% of these patients, respectively. Precaliceal tubular ectasia was observed in 15.5%. Ninety-seven patients had preserved renal function (serum creatinine less than 1.5 mg/dL) at the initial evaluation. Six were excluded because they had other known causes of stone disease. The most common metabolic abnormality in the remaining 91 patients was hypocitric aciduria (ten of 15 patients with measurements). The urine pH in the first voided morning specimens (5.66 +/- 0.05) was significantly lower than that of an unselected control population (5.92 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.001). Hyperuricosuria, hyperoxaluria, and hypercalciuria were observed in six of 32 (18.8%), six of 31 (19.4%), and three of 39 (9.7%) patients with preserved renal function. The composition of the stones, the frequency of hypocitric aciduria, and the low urine pH (possibly related to the defect in excretion of ammonia described in ADPKD), suggest that metabolic, along with mechanical, factors are responsible for the frequent occurrence of nephrolithiasis in this disease.\r"

Neither age (P greater than 0.05) nor injection site (P greater than 0.05) appeared to influence results. Nonresponders (16 of 17; 94%) who were given a fourth vaccine dose also failed to mount an antibody response. Of the 34 responders, 18 were followed by serial anti-HBs determinations. Seven transient responders (7 of 18; 39%) were identified, and anti-HBs fell below 10 S/N (sample/control counts per minute) within 12 to 15 months of the first vaccine dose. A fourth dose was administered to this group and it extended the presence of serum anti-HBs (S/N greater than or equal to 10) in four of six patients for another 2, 8, 10, and 15 months, respectively. Antibody persisted but declined over the study period in the remainder of responders followed serially (11 of 18; 61%). When compared with those responders who lost anti-HBs, those with persistent antibody had higher anti-HBs values at 7 (P less than 0.02) and 12 months (P less than 0.005) after the first injection, and were younger (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DRLB are felt to be an uncommon finding in glomerular diseases without heavy proteinuria, and a rare finding in nonglomerular renal diseases. In order to determine whether DRLB are found in nonglomerular renal diseases, we reviewed the medical records of all patients who had urinalyses performed in our laboratory from February 1975 to June 1983. Three hundred sixty one patients demonstrated less than or equal to +2 proteinuria, and at least two DRLB. Of these, 290 were identified as having a single renal diagnosis. One hundred forty eight patients (51%) had a variety of acute and chronic glomerular diseases, and 125 patients (43.2%) had nonglomerular renal diseases, including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), prerenal azotemia, chronic interstitial nephritis, polycystic kidney disease, acute interstitial nephritis, renal neoplasia, and acute myeloma kidney. Ten patients had transient proteinuria associated with acute illness, and seven patients had no renal disease at all. Only two patients with nonglomerular renal disease had more than five DRLB per 20 high power microscopic fields. The frequency of DRLB in patients with nonglomerular renal diseases was: chronic interstitial nephritis, 26%; polycystic kidney disease, 38%; prerenal azotemia, 20%; ATN, 15%; and acute interstitial nephritis, 33%. These data suggest that at lower levels of proteinuria, DRLB are found frequently in nonglomerular renal diseases, and that DRLB do not differentiate glomerular from nonglomerular renal diseases unless more than five DRLB are found on urinary sediment examination.\r"

In all the occasions, aspirin was given two hours after a standard lunch. Both antacid preparations induced comparable changes in aspirin mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax), if given simultaneously with aspirin, whereas no difference was found in other pharmacokinetic parameters. When antacids were followed (two hours) by aspirin, both Cmax and time of maximum concentration (Tmax) were significantly altered in respect to the value with aspirin alone. No changes in the time course of post aspirin serum thromboxane B2 were detected when aspirin and antacids were administered simultaneously, but the inhibition of serum thromboxane B2 was delayed when antacids were followed (two hours) by aspirin. These results indicate that the administration of antacids to uremic patients interferes with absorption of oral aspirin. This interference can be minimized if aspirin and antacids are given simultaneously.\r"

NaF (greater than 10 mM) stimulated superoxide (O2-) production in both cell types in a time dependent manner. NaF (0.5 to 20 mM) increased cAMP levels by 1.5- to 3.-fold in both neutrophils and monocytes. Increases in cAMP levels were time-dependent; the maximal level was attained within 5 minutes after the addition of NaF, and cAMP levels remained elevated for up to 10 minutes. Only high concentrations of NaF (10 and 20 mM) increased both cAMP levels and O2- production. Therefore, a direct role of cAMP in O2- generation is not likely. It is speculated that since NaF (greater than 10 mM) can complex with extracellular Ca++, and thus reduce free Ca++ concentration required for O2- generation, a NaF-dependent increase in cAMP may restore cytosolic free Ca++ by mobilizing intracellular stores of Ca++. Further, in view of the proposed involvement of a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism in the regulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, we speculate that NaF, by inhibiting phosphoprotein phosphatase activity, may indirectly activate the NADPH oxidase system and thus superoxide generation.\r"

Systolic time intervals were performed in 19 patients during and after the correction of hypophosphatemia; 11 had severe (0.9 +/- 0.15 mg/dL) and eight had moderate (1.4 +/- 0.11 mg/dL) hypophosphatemia. Controls were 14 patients with normal serum phosphorus levels. No patient with hypophosphatemia had clinical congestive heart failure. When hypophosphatemia was corrected, improvement in left ventricular performance was seen only in patients with severe hypophosphatemia (p less than 0.001); in eight patients left ventricular performance was normal during hypophosphatemia but showed significant improvement with its correction (p less than 0.01). Patients with moderate hypophosphatemia showed no significant change. Our results confirm the findings of O'Conner et al, whose study is the only previous one to demonstrate hypophosphatemia-induced myocardial depression in humans. Contradictory results from other studies may be explained by the inclusion of patients with moderate hypophosphatemia and failure to repeat measurements after the correction of hypophosphatemia. We conclude that reversible depression of myocardial performance is seen in hypophosphatemia only when it is severe. In some cases, normal left ventricular performance improves when hypophosphatemia is corrected.\r"

Nifedipine was administered as a 10 mg sublingual dose, followed by 10 mg orally every 8 hours for 24 hours.

An improvement in function to class 3 (five subjects) and class 2 (two subjects) was observed. The remaining five patients experienced no improvement (group 2) and did not receive nifedipine after 24 hours.

AM from all eleven smokers spontaneously released hydrogen peroxide (36 +/- 5.3 nm/10(6) AM, mean +/- SEM). AM from eight of the eleven smokers released more hydrogen peroxide when incubated with bleomycin (smokers 55 +/- 6.8 nm/10(6) AM, p less than 0.05). There was no difference in the amount of lactic dehydrogenase released by AM spontaneously or when incubated with bleomycin at 25 mU/mL, suggesting that this dose of bleomycin was not directly toxic to the AM. Results from this study further support the premise that bleomycin pulmonary toxicity may result from the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and that cigarette smoking may predispose to bleomycin pulmonary toxicity.\r"

It is uncertain whether the hypoxemia is caused by the effects of the viral infection on the lungs or is secondary to sickling of red blood cells in the pulmonary vasculature or both. The hypoxia may be sufficiently severe to require treatment with both oxygen and transfusion. The physical damage to the bone marrow associated with bone marrow necrosis may be more important than selective acute erythroblastopenia in inducing aplastic crisis in patients with sickle cell disorders.

Removal of the shunt and continued treatment with penicillin and rifampin resulted in cure.\r"

While some evidence suggests that RSV may be responsible for more serious respiratory illness in the elderly and chronically ill, it has not been shown to cause life-threatening respiratory tract disease in previously healthy adults. This report describes a previously healthy woman who experienced the acute onset of right lower lobe pneumonia which rapidly progressed to the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Acute and convalescent serology showed RSV was the cause of the respiratory tract illness. Michigan Department of Public Health records revealed six additional cases of adult bilateral pneumonia with diagnostic antibody titers to RSV, with or without coinfection with a second organism. These data suggest that RSV may be an under-recognized cause of lower respiratory tract disease in adults.\r"

The fetus is dependent on the placenta for the provision of amino acids, the first step being concentration of amino acids within the syncytiotrophoblast for subsequent transfer to the fetus. A reliable technique for the isolation of human syncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane has been described, and the suitability of this preparation for the study of amino acid uptake and membrane transport has been well documented. Using this technique, the microvillous vesicle uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), a nonmetabolizable amino acid, has been determined over multiple time points for normal (NL) pregnancies and those complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and those delivering small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates. There was no significant difference in AIB uptake between NL pregnancies and those complicated by PIH or NIDDM. Compared to each of the above, AIB uptake by the SGA group was significantly less at each time point. These results suggest that normal placental amino acid transport mechanisms may be altered in SGA pregnancies. If so, such alterations may interfere with the normal provision of nutrients to the fetus and ultimately contribute to impaired growth in utero.\r"

The intracellular organisms in this material were free cytoplasmic forms showing inner membrane degeneration, loss of cytoplasmic granules, and absence of flagella. The diameter of the coccoids was up to four times that of the elongated forms, as in plate cultures. Intracellular organisms were not found in challenged unirradiated controls, indicating that irradiation of mouse cells may be required for intracellular infection with human strains of C jejuni. In contrast, challenged human fibroblasts contained typical elongated organisms in cytoplasmic vacuoles. These findings are discussed with reference to Campylobacter strain, host resistance, and \"natural\" animal and human Campylobacter infections.\r"

Myointimal hyperplasia in arteries has been shown to be dependent on age after vascular endothelial denudation and injury associated with vascular transplantation. Because myointimal thickening is greater in aged rats than in younger rats, and aortic segments from old rats transplanted into young syngeneic recipients have a greater myointimal proliferative response to injury than its host environment, the authors examined the cell cycle distributions of old and young rat arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) by flow-cytometric analysis. They observed that there is an apparent age-dependent variation in the cell cycle distribution. Moreover, old SMCs have a greater percentage of their population in the S phase and not G2/M, compared with young SMCs; and there is a decrease in the percentage of old cells in the G0/G1 phase as compared with young SMCs. These differences may reflect the cellular changes observed during myointimal hyperplasia following vascular injury. It is concluded that our data support the hypothesis that the proliferation of SMCs is dependent, in part, on those processes related to aging as well as to the phenotypic state of the cell.\r"

This is accompanied by the formation of contraction bands, loss of sarcolemmal integrity, and mitochondrial disruption. The present study investigated the effect of uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) during reperfusion after 30 or 60 minutes of ischemia on this reperfusion-induced Ca2+ gain. After 60 minutes' ischemia, reperfusion with 1 mM DNP delayed the accumulation of Ca2+ and increased the duration of reperfusion before sarcolemmal disruptions were evident. This suggested that once sarcolemmal integrity is lost, Ca2+ will freely enter the cells irrespective of whether the mitochondria are able to accumulate Ca2+. After 30 minutes ischemia, reperfusion for up to 30 minutes with 0.1 or 1 mM DNP attenuated the Ca2+ gain and maintained sarcolemmal integrity. Because the authors previously found that maintaining sarcolemmal integrity alone does not totally abolish Ca2+ gain, it is suggested that DNP must prevent the entry of Ca2+ that occurs via route(s) other than those created by the loss of sarcolemmal integrity.\r"

In brief accidental exposure to asbestos, this would be the most likely site of a significant cellular or fibrotic reaction. The characteristics and progression of tissue reactions occurring at first alveolar duct bifurcations after a single brief asbestos exposure was defined using morphometric techniques. Seven-week-old rats were exposed, nose only, for 1 hour to chrysotile asbestos fibers. After the exposure, the animals were kept in air for 2 days or 1 month, and then their lungs were fixed by vascular perfusion or by intratracheal instillation of 2% glutaraldehyde. The first bifurcations of seven alveolar ducts in each animal were isolated from plastic-embedded tissue and thin-sectioned for electron-microscopic analysis. Two days after exposure, the volume of epithelium and interstitium in the duct bifurcations had increased by 78% and 28%, respectively (P less than 0.05). The total number and volume of alveolar macrophages on the bifurcations increased about 10 times (P less than 0.05), whereas the number and volume of interstitial macrophages increased threefold (P less than 0.05). Statistically significant increases in the numbers of Type I (82%) and Type II (29%) epithelial cells also occurred. One month after the 1-hour exposure, the volume of epithelium and the number of Type I and Type II cells were still greater than control values, but these differences no longer achieved statistical significance. The volume of the interstitium, on the other hand, increased 67% (P less than 0.05), and this was accompanied by a persistently high number of interstitial macrophages, accumulation of myofibroblasts/smooth muscle cells, and an increased volume of interstitial matrix. These results demonstrate that a brief exposure to chrysotile asbestos causes a rapid response that involves an influx of macrophages to the first alveolar duct bifurcations and alterations in the alveolar epithelium. These acute structural changes are followed by a progressive response manifested by increased numbers of interstitial cells and localized interstitial fibrosis.\r"

HHF35 reacted with 29 of 30 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, whereas antibodies to creatine kinase M and myoglobin were positive on only 12 and 7 tumors, respectively. HHF35 did not react with any case of neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, or Ewing's sarcoma when the antibody diluent contained 50 mM EDTA. These results indicate that HHF35 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for myogenic differentiation and that it will be useful in the differential diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcomas.\r"

In a series of 29 patients with serologic evidence of HIV infection and liver abnormalities, 8 (28%) had sinusoidal lesions. Peliosis hepatis was present in 2 cases, and sinusoidal dilatation in 6. These patients were classified as follows: 3 AIDS, 4 AIDS-related complex, 1 unclassifiable. Ultrastructural lesions of the sinusoidal barrier were observed in all the cases. They closely mimicked the changes previously reported in peliotic and peliotic-like changes of various origins. A striking particularity was, however, the presence of numerous and hyperplastic sinusoidal macrophages. This work suggests that an injury of the endothelial cells, directly or indirectly related to the presence of HIV, may be incriminated in the pathogenesis of sinusoidal lesions during HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "After 25 minutes of ischemia, in the isolated rat preparation, hearts fail to reestablish adequate contractile function. To determine whether this failure was associated with a transmural variation in the metabolic response of myocardial cells to reperfusion, the authors subjected hearts to 25 minutes of global ischemia with and without 5 or 20 minutes of reperfusion. After freeze-drying the left ventricular myocardium was divided into subepicardial (EPI) and subendocardial (ENDO) regions before estimating the lactate, total adenine pool metabolites, and creatine phosphate (CP) and phosphate concentrations in each region. Other groups of hearts were perfusion-fixed with glutaraldehyde then injected with nuclear track emulsion to demonstrate that a high proportion of capillaries in both the subendocardial (89%) and subepicardial (95%) myocardium transmitted perfusate after 5 minutes of reperfusion. Reperfusion removed lactate equally from each region. Thus the differences in the capacity of reperfusion of these regions to recover CP (ENDO, 100%; EPI, 168% of preischemic values), to elevate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (ENDO, 32%; EPI, 63%), or to retain adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (ENDO, 625%; EPI, 277%) were unlikely to be due to regional differences in microvascular function. Despite the better preservation of both structure and metabolism in the subepicardium, there was, during reperfusion, a progressive loss of purine precursors from cells in both regions of the myocardium. These results suggest that the loss of ability of the myocardium to recover significant function after relatively short periods of ischemia is due to their inability, on reperfusion, to synthesise sufficient ATP from the available precursors. This capacity for resynthesis of ATP is lost more rapidly in the subendocardial than in the subepicardial myocardium.\r"

Flow cytometry for the analysis of nuclear DNA content and cell cycle parameters has also been postulated to be an objective aid in the diagnosis of dysplasia and carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. The authors investigated the relationship among sulfated mucin, flow cytometric data, and histologic diagnosis in each of 152 biopsies from 42 patients who had Barrett's specialized metaplastic epithelium. Sulfated mucin, as detected by the high iron diamine-Alcian blue stain, was present in biopsies from 8 of 11 (73%) patients with the histologic diagnosis of dysplasia or carcinoma, in 7 of 9 (78%) patients whose biopsies were indefinite for dysplasia, and in 12 of 22 (55%) patients whose biopsies were negative for dysplasia (P = 0.37). Sulfated mucins predominated in 9%, 22%, and 9% of the patients, respectively (P = 0.56). Abnormal flow cytometry (aneuploidy or increased G2/tetraploid fraction) was found in all patients with the histologic diagnosis of dysplasia or carcinoma, in 3 of 9 (33%) indefinite for dysplasia, and in 1 of 22 (5%) negative for dysplasia (P = less than 0.0001). Neither the presence nor the predominance of sulfated mucin in the specialized metaplastic epithelium of Barrett's esophagus has sufficiently high sensitivity or specificity for dysplasia or carcinoma to be of value in managing patients. Abnormal flow cytometry shows excellent correlation with the histologic diagnosis of dysplasia and carcinoma; it detects a subset of patients whose biopsies are histologically indefinite or negative for dysplasia, but who have flow cytometric abnormalities similar to those otherwise seen only in dysplasia and carcinoma.\r"

The histology of ocular depigmentation, which occurs during melanoma arrest and skin depigmentation, was studied in eyes of animals that had successful and unsuccessful tumor regression. In 12 animals one eye was removed at an early stage and the second eye at a later stage of disease or maturation. The histologic and clinical course of the ocular changes was correlated with changes in the cutaneous tumors. Animals showing rapid cutaneous tumor regression developed acute uveitis that was characterized by an influx of mononuclear cells into the stroma of the ciliary body; later this spread to the iris and choroid. In late stages the cornea sometimes developed a band of calcium precipitates beneath the basal epithelial cells (band keratopathy). Uveal melanocytes developed watery cytoplasm typical of cells with ruptured plasma membranes. Released melanin granules were taken up initially into the lysosomal compartment of mononuclear cells having the various morphologic features of lymphocytes and monocytes; later, melanin also appeared in fibrocyte lysosomes. The relationship of these processes to various cell-mediated immunity phenomena is being studied.\r"

Particles from both human and rabbit aortas had a density of between 1.02 g/ml and 1.08 g/ml with a peak at d = 1.036 g/ml. These particles had a high molar ratio of unesterified cholesterol to phospholipid (2.4:1 in rabbit, 2.6:1 in human) and a high percentage of their cholesterol in an unesterified form (82% in rabbit, 76% in human). The particles had diameters between 700 and 3000 A and showed unilamellar and multilamellar structures. Freeze-fractured particles had smooth fracture faces and sometimes contained a smooth-surfaced core. Upon incubation with filipin, particles showed typical filipin-sterol complexes, demonstrating the presence of unesterified cholesterol.

The role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) was also studied by viral genomic DNA probes. They detected clonal rearrangements in 3 of the 4 patients with the systemic variant of Castleman's; no patients with localized disease had rearrangements. Copies of EBV genome were also detected in 2 of the 3 patients with clonal rearrangements.

Alveolar macrophages lavaged from animals receiving elastase contained significantly higher enzyme levels at 21 and 105 days (16,200 and 17,000 U/mg protein/hr, respectively) as compared with saline-treated animals (12,300 units). In contrast, cells from animals receiving bleomycin showed a decrease in activity at 21 and 105 days (9700 and 9900 units, respectively). At 10 days enzyme levels did not differ significantly. The results suggest that cathepsin B levels in alveolar macrophages reflect differences in lung destruction and connective tissue repair in vivo. In addition, the finding of high cathepsin B activity in animals with emphysema suggests the possibility that cysteine proteases contribute to progressive lung destruction initiated by the intratracheal instillation of elastase.\r"

For each large truck involved in a crash, three trucks were randomly selected for inspection from the traffic stream at the same time and place as the crash but one week later. The effects of truck and driver characteristics on crashes were assessed by comparing their relative frequency among the crash-involved and comparison sample trucks. Double trailer trucks were consistently overinvolved in crashes by a factor of two to three in both single and multiple vehicle crashes. Single unit trucks pulling trailers also were overinvolved. Doubles also had a higher frequency of jackknifing compared to tractor-trailers. The substantial overinvolvement of doubles in crashes was found regardless of driver age, hours of driving, cargo weight, or type of fleet. Younger drivers, long hours of driving, and operating empty trucks were also associated with higher crash involvement.\r"

Because race categories in NIMS were limited to White, Black, and all, we studied six states in which greater than 85 per cent of newborns who were neither White nor Black were Native American. In these states, the infant mortality risk (IMR) among Native Americans was 15.3 deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 8.7 deaths among Whites, relative risk (RR) = 1.8 (95% CI = 1.5-2.0). The percentage of Native American infants with less than 2,500 g birthweights was 5.8 per cent versus 5.0 per cent for White infants. Birthweight-specific neonatal mortality risks were similar for the two race groups, but birthweight-specific postneonatal mortality risks (PNMRs) were more than three times as high among Native Americans compared with Whites for infants of greater than or equal to 2,500 g birthweight. PNMRs were elevated for most causes of death and for all categories for maternal age, educational attainment, trimester prenatal care began, and number of previous live births. Leading causes of postneonatal death among Native Americans of greater than or equal to 2,500 g birthweight were sudden infant death syndrome and infections.\r"

Between 1984 and 1985, the rate rose by less than 1 per cent to 108.2. More detailed data by age and race, available only through 1983, indicate that the decline in the 1980-83 period was not shared by all age groups. For example, pregnancy rates continued to increase for women in their thirties, and teenage pregnancy remained substantially the same. In 1983, 61 per cent of all pregnancies ended in live birth, 26 per cent in induced abortion, and 13 per cent in fetal loss. Pregnancy rates in that year were two-thirds higher for women of races other than White than for White women, and pregnancies of other-than-White women were more likely to terminate as an induced abortion or fetal loss. However, White teenagers and teenagers of other races were about equally likely to have their pregnancy end in induced abortion or fetal loss.\r"

Only 3.4 per cent of mothers with previous cesarean delivery had VBAC in their subsequent 1980 delivery; this increased to 6.6 per cent in 1985. Because VBAC is a relatively infrequent event, 1980-85 data were combined and indicate that in this period 4.9 per cent of mothers with previous cesarean had a vaginal birth in their subsequent delivery. Combined 1980-85 VBAC rates are under 10 per cent for all age, race, marital status, region, hospital size, hospital ownership, and expected source of payment groups. Between 1980 and 1985, over 1.4 million repeat cesareans were performed for mothers having a live birth. Evidence suggests that potentially over 500,000 of these repeat cesareans could have been VBACs (over and above the 74,000 VBACs which occurred). VBAC mothers' mean length of hospital stay is 3.2 days, which compares closely with 3.0 days for other vaginal deliveries, but both contrast sharply with 5.6 days for repeat cesareans and 6.0 days for primary cesareans. Except for the uterine scar from the previous cesarean, VBAC mothers appear to have about the same history and frequency of complications as mothers with other vaginal deliveries. If the 500,000 repeat cesareans had been VBACs, surgical fees and costs for 1.2 million days of hospital stay would have been averted over the 1980-85 period.\r"

  ".W": "Usual prescribing strategies of hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women by Los Angeles area gynecologists, both now and 10 years ago, were investigated by a mail survey. Of the 330 gynecologists who responded, estrogen therapy is currently used as a routine by nearly all (95 per cent), for women both with and without a uterus. Over three-fourths of these physicians favor use of 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen. The estrogen is combined with cyclic progestin therapy, usually 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, by 86 per cent of gynecologists using estrogen for women with a uterus, and by 47 per cent for women without a uterus. Although conjugated equine estrogens were used widely for both groups of patients 10 years ago, a higher dose generally was preferred. Use of progestin therapy was uncommon (less than 20 per cent) for any postmenopausal patients at that time. Although the most common monthly therapeutic regimen for estrogen/progestin therapy is estrogen for days 1-25 and progestin for days 16-25, there is wide variation in prescribing strategies. We present these findings in the context of the probable effects of estrogen/progestin therapy on various chronic disease outcomes.\r"

We assessed three areas of competence of BSE in one group immediately before the class, in the other group immediately after the class, and in both groups at follow-up one year later. Of the 459 women who attended the class, 286 returned for the one-year follow-up. All three areas of competence measured showed significant improvement in the group tested immediately after the class compared with the group tested just before the class. Competence scores at the one-year follow-up remained twice as high as those before the class although there was a decrease in competence from just after the class. Younger women proved more competent in performing BSE than did older women. At one year, participants further reported performing BSE nearly twice as often as before the class. We conclude that competent BSE can be learned and frequency of BSE can be increased from a one-session class.\r"

For other data items, there was enormous variability in completeness and high institution-to-institution variation. Record completeness did not differ consistently between comprehensive and community cancer centers. We conclude that the hospital patient record is useful for tracking the frequency of surgical and related events. However, studies of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures should not rely solely on the hospital medical record due to the high rates of silent records.\r"

In this study, a cohort of 198 non-institutionalized elderly individuals (mean age at entry = 66) were followed for periods up to 12 years after initial polysomnography. The mortality ratio for sleep apnea (defined as a Respiratory Disturbance Index of over 10 events per sleep hour) was estimated to be 2.7 (95% CI = .95, 7.47). Multiple regression with the Cox proportional hazards model suggested that cardiovascular death was most clearly associated with age in this cohort. These results raise the possibility that \"natural\" death during sleep in the elderly may be associated with specific pathophysiological events during sleep.\r"

This paper will describe the campaign, and its impact on consumers, cereal industry sales, food industry advertising practices, health regulatory policy, and the organizational credibility of both NCI and Kellogg. For the past three years, Kellogg has included NCI's cancer prevention messages in their advertisements for All-Bran cereal and on their bran cereal boxes. This collaborative effort has stimulated considerable controversy over whether the health claims made on the cereal label are in violation of federal food labeling regulations. Meanwhile, research has demonstrated the positive impact of the campaign on consumer's knowledge and behavior regarding fiber as well as on Kellogg's profits. Other manufacturers are anxious to jump on the \"branwagon\"; however, many unanswered questions remain about this new approach to health advertising.\r"

The risk of gallstone disease among women who used estrogens for at least one year prior to diagnosis of their condition, relative to that of other women, was 1.18 (95% CI: 0.65-2.13). Standardization for the effects of age, race, obesity, parity, thiazide use, and history of high blood pressure did not alter appreciably the estimate of relative risk. Among estrogen users, the duration of use was similar in cases and controls. Our findings suggest that if non-contraceptive estrogen use is a risk factor for gallstone disease (requiring surgery) in women, its effect is very small.\r"

We have studied parasite sequestration of P. fragile and demonstrated the existence of a new property of cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes, \"rosetting,\" which is defined as the agglutination of uninfected erythrocytes around parasitized erythrocytes. Rosetting in vitro and sequestration in vivo appear simultaneously as the parasite matures. The spleen plays a role in modulating cytoadherence; both sequestration and rosetting, which occur with cloned parasites from spleen-intact animals, are markedly reduced in splenectomized animals infected with parasites derived from the same clone. Sequestration and rosetting can be reversed by immune serum. Protease treatment of infected blood abolishes rosetting; however, if treatment is performed at an early stage of schizogony, rosetting reappears if parasites are allowed to further develop in the absence of protease. These results indicate that with P. fragile in its natural primate host, rosetting and sequestration are related to the presence on the infected erythrocyte surface of a parasite-derived antigenic component, the expression of which is modulated by the spleen.\r"

Postmortem examinations were carried out in 22 deaths due to amebiasis. For the patients with amebiasis, there was a bimodal age distribution with peaks at 2-3 years and greater than 40 years, whereas the control patients had a unimodal distribution with the peak at 0-1 year. The sex distribution was equal in childhood but young adults were predominantly female and older adults predominantly male. The clinical features significantly associated with amebiasis were prolonged dysentery, prior measles rash, malnutrition, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypoproteinemia (all P less than 0.05). The case fatality rate in amebiasis was 29%, which was significantly higher than 11% for the controls (P less than 0.05). Postmortem findings included extensive colitis with deep ulcers and complications, including colonic perforation in 2 cases, peritonitis in 4 cases, pneumonia in 9 cases, and septicemia in 5 cases. These results indicate that invasive amebiasis in this population differs from other diarrheal diseases, affecting mainly children greater than 2 years and adults and causing severe and fatal illness characterized by extensive colitis with diverse systemic consequences.\r"

Mated schistosomes phosphorylate 2DG and glucose at a greater rate than do unmated worms. In contrast, the phosphorylation coefficient is greater in separated than mated schistosomes. In schistosomes exposed to oltipraz for short time periods (6 min, at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml) glucose utilization rates were significantly reduced in (both mated and separated) female S. mansoni and by a similar magnitude (not significant) in males.\r"

The infection also stimulated specific IgA and IgE antibody responses in most patients and, in practically all patients, there was a marked increase of total IgE. There was a moderate but significant correlation between serum IgG antibody level and severity of infection as judged from the quantity of eggs in the stool of the patients. There was also a significant elevation of antibody in the bile and serum of O. viverrini-infected patients who also had biliary obstruction. Analysis of paired samples from individual patients showed that while IgG was the predominant class of antibody in the serum of all patients, IgA was present at approximately the same level as IgG or higher in the bile of many patients. In addition to IgA and IgG antibodies, IgE antibody was also detectable in 50% of the bile samples. The high level of IgA antibody in the bile together with its presence in association with the secretory component suggested a selective transport and/or local production of IgA antibody by the hepatobiliary system of these patients.\r"

Antigen-containing milk samples markedly inhibited mitogen-induced proliferation of human mononuclear cells and activated cells within this population that suppressed the proliferative response of autologous lymphocytes to mitogens and antigens. These findings indicate that parasite products are present in breast milk of O. volvulus-infected women and suggest that these may induce immune tolerance and/or suppression in infants born of infected mothers.\r"

Behaviors thought to increase exposure to E. multilocularis and the chronologic occurrence of these behaviors in the participant's life were assessed by a standardized questionnaire. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have owned dogs for their entire lives (odds ratio 6.00, P less than 0.05), tethered their dogs near the house (odds ratio 8.50, P less than 0.05), and lived in houses built directly on the tundra rather than on gravel or a permanent foundation (odds ratio 11.00, P less than 0.01). Case-patients were not more likely to have owned sled dogs, trapped or skinned foxes, or engaged in other outdoor activities away from home. These findings suggest that controlling the parasite in the domestic dog population, as well as controlling the dog population itself, are important aspects of preventing alveolar hydatid disease in the northwestern Native Alaskan population.\r"

The prevalence of cicatricial trachoma was low in young children and climbed gradually with age to greater than 40% among those greater than or equal to 50 years. Risk factors for inflammatory disease in young children included low socioeconomic status of the family, long walking distance to the household's primary source of water, absence of a latrine in the family compound, and presence of trachoma among siblings. Indices of crowding practices were not associated with inflammatory disease. An apparent inverse association of facewashing and inflammatory trachoma in children did not hold up when adjusted for other risk factors.\r"

The mean titers of hemagglutination inhibition, neutralization, and infection-enhancing activities against dengue 2 virus were not statistically different among the three groups. However, among infants who developed dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome there was a strong correlation between the mothers' dengue 2 neutralizing titers and infant age at the time of onset of severe illness, where no such correlation was found among the other two groups. Furthermore, the actual age at which dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome occurred in each infant correlated with the age at which maximum enhancing activity for dengue 2 infection in mononuclear phagocytes was predicted. This critical time for the occurrence of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome was observed to be approximately 2 months after the time calculated for maternal dengue 2 neutralizing antibodies to degrade below a protective level. In addition, sera of mothers of infants with dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome enhanced dengue 2 virus infection to a slightly greater degree than did sera from mothers of infants with pyrexia of unknown origin and toddlers with dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal dengue antibodies play a dual role by first protecting and later increasing the risk of development of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome in infants who become infected by dengue 2 virus.\r"

A seroepidemiological survey carried out from 1984 to 1986 in 14 districts showed high rates of Japanese encephalitis antibody in swine sera in two districts. A more detailed 3-year survey showed that pig farms positive for Japanese encephalitis antibody were detected at the same sites in Hiroshima near Sapporo as negative farms. These data suggest that Japanese encephalitis virus is maintained in a distinct endemic focus and has the capacity to overwinter locally in Hokkaido.\r"

Infection rates ranged from 51% (65/127) for Cx. salinarius to 96% (64/67) for Ae. canadensis. Disseminated infection rates were generally greater at 14 days than at 7 days after the infectious bloodmeal, and, with the exception of An. bradleyi-crucians, they were not significantly different than the pooled rate of 59% for each species tested. Only 5/55 (9%) of the An. bradleyi-crucians developed a disseminated infection. For most of the species, about half of the mosquitoes with a disseminated infection transmitted an infectious dose of virus to hamsters. While all species, with the exception of An. bradleyi-crucians, transmitted virus, Ae. canadensis, Ae. taeniorhynchus, and Cx. tarsalis had the highest vector potential of the species tested. Following inoculation of approximately 10(1.6) plaque forming units of virus, 100% of the mosquitoes of each species became infected. For most species, transmission rates were similar for inoculated individuals and those that developed a disseminated infection following peroral infection. Viral titers of transmitting and nontransmitting-disseminated individuals were similar for all species tested. These data suggest that, if Rift Valley fever virus was introduced into North America, several mosquito species would be capable of transmitting it.\r"

Fort Morgan and Buggy Creek viruses are closely related to each other, whereas Highlands J and Aura viruses are distinct from other members of this antigenic complex. There appear to be parallels between geographic distribution and antigenic relatedness.

  ".W": "Seven hundred sixty-five patients were operated on in two hospitals in 1979 and 1980, 190 of whom were submitted to operative cholangiography, 41 to primary common duct exploration, and 534 to neither. The incidence of common duct stones was 4 percent in the minimal indications group, 21 percent in the moderate indications group, and 91 percent in the maximal indications group. Follow-up of 5 years revealed 1 recurrence in the minimal group subjected to cholangiography and none among the 534 in whom no cholangiogram was obtained. In the period from 1981 through 1985, eight patients returned with common duct stones, having had no common duct stones at the primary operation. In the same period, 1,722 of 2,533 patients were operated on without cholangiography. The ratio of recurrences to primary operations without cholangiography was 1:225 or 0.45 percent. From these findings, we conclude that on the basis of cost-effectiveness and insurance against subsequent disease and disability, cholangiography is only indicated in patients with moderate indications (minimal jaundice, moderately dilated common duct, pancreatitis, or an increased serum amylase level). Cholangiography is not indicated if there are no indications of obstruction of the common duct by stones (as a routine for small stones in the gallbladder, if the cystic duct is patent, or if there is an isolated increased serum alkaline phosphatase level). Cholangiography is also unnecessary, when the indications of common duct stones are maximal (deep jaundice, huge common duct, cholangitis, or palpable stone). In our geographic area, intraoperative cholangiography should be selected in 7 to 8 percent of patients.\r"

The present study has described our experience with subclavian and external carotid artery revascularization for symptomatic severe cerebral ischemia from common and internal carotid artery occlusion. Nine patients (five men and four women) with a mean age of 62 (range 41 to 82 years) were diagnosed as having symptomatic severe cerebral ischemia. All patients had ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms, seven had amaurosis fugax, and two had associated syncope. Four patients (three men and one woman) were hypertensive, four (two men and two women) had diabetes, eight smoked, and all had a history of coronary artery disease. All of the patients had noninvasive laboratory studies and preoperative angiography, and three had postoperative angiography. Five patients were successfully revascularized to a patent external carotid artery despite nonvisualization by angiography. Six patients had unilateral and three bilateral occlusion of the common and internal carotid arteries appropriate to their symptoms. Using regional anesthesia, four patients underwent a subclavian-external carotid bypass with polytetrafluoroethylene; saphenous vein was used in five; and three had concomitant axilloaxillary bypass grafting with polytetrafluoroethylene. Neurologic improvement (that is, no subsequent deficit and no progression of symptoms) was noted in all nine patients with a follow-up of 4 to 28 months (mean 11.2 months). Two patients died from myocardial infarction 4 and 7 months after operation. Subclavian-external carotid artery bypass is a safe addition to the options for the treatment of symptomatic severe cerebral ischemia with occlusion of the common and internal carotid arteries, visualization of a superior thyroid collateral vessel on the recipient end, and nonvisualization of the external carotid artery.\r"

A total of 25 variables were independently evaluated in each limb. Follow-up at least 6 months after operation was carried out in all patients. The postocclusive transcutaneous oxygen recovery time was found to be the most accurate predictor of short-term femoropopliteal bypass graft success. Preoperative foot transcutaneous oxygen recovery time values were significantly worse in patients whose femoropopliteal bypass grafts failed than in those in whom the outcome was successful (p less than 0.03). Transcutaneous oxygen recovery time values were also valuable in patients who underwent aortofemoral bypass; patients with isolated aortoiliac disease had significantly better foot transcutaneous oxygen recovery time values than those with combined aortoiliac and femoropopliteal disease (p less than 0.05). Foot transcutaneous oxygen recovery time values were also found to correlate well with the severity of symptoms (p less than 0.01), as did ankle-brachial Doppler pressure indices. Although the other variables analyzed provided useful diagnostic information, none were as accurate as the postocclusive transcutaneous oxygen recovery time in predicting the outcome of peripheral vascular reconstruction. As a means of more accurately classifying patients with peripheral vascular disease, we recommend the complimentary use of clinical findings, angiography, and hemodynamic and transcutaneous oximetry measurements. Because transcutaneous oxygen tension reflects the balance between local oxygen supply and demand, it may help to better define risk factors preoperatively in physiologic terms.\r"

(2) Insulin resistance developed when the redox state of the liver mitochondria was severely reduced. (3) It was very difficult to maintain the blood glucose level within normal range when the redox state was severely reduced. In patients, insufficient glucose administration can easily result in hypoglycemia, and excess administration can result in hyperglycemia, which might, in turn, result in hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic dehydration.\r"

Ninety-three cirrhotic patients with previous episodes of bleeding from esophageal varices underwent a distal splenorenal shunt procedure (47 patients). The operative mortality rate was 2 percent in both groups. The intraoperative decrease of portal hypertension after the portacaval shunt procedure was higher than after the distal splenorenal shunt procedure (p less than 0.05), and in those with patent shunts, there was a 0 percent incidence of early variceal rebleeding after the portacaval shunt procedure compared with a 9 percent incidence after the distal splenorenal shunt procedure (p less than 0.05). Both shunts, however, had similarly satisfactory results in preventing long-term variceal rebleeding (portacaval shunt 2 percent and distal splenorenal shunt 0 percent). Postoperative ascites was more common after the distal splenorenal shunt procedure (58 percent versus 24 percent; p less than 0.01). Analysis of actuarial survival curves showed no difference between the two procedures. The incidences of long-term episodes of chronic encephalopathy were not statistically different after both procedures. The only three instances of severe encephalopathy occurred in patients with the portacaval shunt (p less than 0.05). The distal splenorenal shunt also seemed to have a less negative effect on postoperative liver function than the portacaval shunt. These data suggest that the selective shunt should be viewed as a first choice strategy in the treatment of portal hypertension.\r"

After inflation, significant increases in right atrial pressure (89 percent), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (34 percent), and mean pulmonary artery pressure (21 percent) were noted. Mean peripheral arterial pressure increased 11.2 percent. Depression of the cardiac index (18 percent), left ventricular stroke work (20 percent), and right ventricular stroke work (16.4 percent) with associated increases in total peripheral resistance (26 percent) and pulmonary vascular resistance (18 percent) occurred in 5 of 10 patients. Left ventricular function curves revealed a progressive decrease in ventricular function at 50 mm Hg and 75 mm Hg. We have concluded that the effect of the pneumatic antishock garment on myocardial function is variable and unpredictably dangerous in the elderly patient with diminished myocardial reserve. As no significant benefit was derived from inflation pressures greater than 50 mm Hg in these patients, the lowest combination of pressures producing the most efficacious results should be used.\r"

The complication and death rates were significantly higher in patients whose anastomoses were completed as part of an emergency procedure. Even though various one- and two-layer inverting techniques, suture materials, and staples were used, we could not identify any one method as being clearly superior in preventing anastomotic complications, although the results do suggest that some caution may be appropriate before mechanical stapling devices are universally applied. The results support that adherence to accepted surgical principles of reducing the solid content and fecal flora of the colon prior to operation, insuring an excellent blood supply to both bowel ends, even approximation of the bowel ends with inverting sutures which include the submucosal layer of the bowel, absence of tension, meticulous hemostasis, and avoidance of anastomosis in the presence of peritonitis are the primary means of avoiding dehiscence of colon anastomoses.\r"

The incidence of postoperative deep venous thrombosis was studied using iodine-125 fibrinogen in 64 patients with malignant disease who had intermittent pneumatic leg compression for 48 hours postoperatively. Changes in euglobulin lysis time and B beta 15-42 peptide were investigated before and after operation in 16 patients with benign disease, in 27 patients with malignant disease who did not have postoperative intermittent pneumatic leg compression, and in another 29 patients with malignant disease who had postoperative intermittent pneumatic leg compression. The overall incidence of deep venous thrombosis was 6.25 percent. A prolongation of euglobulin lysis time was found postoperatively in all three groups, which was significant in malignant disease groups, although less significant in the group with intermittent pneumatic leg compression when compared with the benign disease group. Preoperatively, a significant increase in B beta 15-42 peptide was found in patients with malignant disease when compared with patients with benign disease. Postoperatively, the B beta 15-42 level increased in the same pattern in all groups and no significant differences in the levels were found among them. A significant shortening of euglobulin lysis time by intermittent pneumatic leg compression, in addition to its hemodynamic effects, is considered an important factor in the prevention of postoperative deep venous thrombosis.\r"

They frequently lead to death by producing obstruction to bile flow and hepatic failure. Initial operations frequently fail because of progression of primary disease. Although bile duct carcinomas respond to radiation, technical constraints limit delivery using an external beam technique. A number of studies have appeared in the literature describing the use of local irradiation delivered by way of catheters placed intraoperatively. In the present study, we have described an alternative method of implantation using a simple endoscopic technique utilizing a choledochojejunocutaneous fistula for access. The advantage of their approach is that the extent of the tumor can be determined visually and biopsy performed, facilitating accurate implant placement. In addition, serial examinations may allow early detection of recurrent disease and fecal retreatment.\r"

Mothers were randomized to receive either 0.5% bupivacaine plain or 0.5% bupivacaine with adrenaline 1:200,000. After a 2-ml test dose, the remaining 18 ml was injected over 5 minutes. The use of adrenaline did not significantly alter the onset or duration, but improved the efficacy of the epidural block. Mean time to onset of adequate surgical anaesthesia was 20 minutes. Only 10 patients required more than the initial 100 mg of bupivacaine. Epidural anaesthesia was supplemented in eight patients with nitrous oxide and/or intravenous opioids.\r"

Postoperative pain and demeanour were assessed initially by an observer and later by use of a parental questionnaire. Wound infiltration of local anaesthetic solution provided analgesia which was comparable to that associated with caudal block, and the incidence of side effects was similar in the two groups. Wound infiltration of local anaesthetic offers a simple, safe alternative to caudal block for provision of postoperative analgesia in this group of patients.\r"

Recovery was similar after either premedicant and psychomotor function was still depressed 4 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Nearly 90% of patients felt that they had benefitted from either premedicant. We conclude that midazolam is a suitable drug for premedication in day case surgery.\r"

Prolonged postoperative analgesia, minimal disturbance of consciousness and comfortable breathing were common to the groups that received buprenorphine. The higher concentration of buprenorphine improved the quality and duration of analgesia. The only side effects found in the buprenorphine groups were nausea and vomiting in 11 and 14 patients, respectively, in groups B and C. Our study shows that buprenorphine is an effective analgesic, suitable for the management of postoperative pain in elderly patients.\r"

The commonest cause of respiratory failure on admission was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; this occurred in 27 patients, seven of whom also had pulmonary cytomegalovirus infection. Four patients had Kaposi's sarcoma and three of these patients also had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The overall mortality was 72%; twenty (80%) of the patients who required artificial ventilation, died. Ten patients survived to leave the intensive care unit, but one patient died of respiratory failure prior to discharge home.\r"

Twenty healthy children aged between 1 and 24 months were anaesthetised with halothane in oxygen. Laryngoscopy and intubation were performed in a double-blind fashion using a Miller No. 1 Oxyscope blade either with or without oxygen insufflation. Transcutaneous oxygen tension, arterial pressure and heart rate were measured before and after laryngoscopy, and duration of laryngoscopy was recorded. Transcutaneous oxygen tension decreased by 7.1% (SD 6.1%) when oxygen insufflation was used, compared to 33.0% (SD 15.1%) without oxygen insufflation (p less than 0.0001). There were no significant differences in mean duration of laryngoscopy or patient age. We conclude that oxygen insufflation during laryngoscopy and intubation of spontaneously breathing, anaesthetised infants effectively minimises the decrease in transcutaneous oxygen tension from pre-laryngoscopy levels, and makes instrumentation of the airway safer.\r"

The majority of mothers experienced little discomfort during the procedure but 2% found insertion to be very uncomfortable. There was no significant difference in the complication rate, ease of use, or patient discomfort between the 18- or 16-gauge needles. Epidural analgesia, although safe, is not without hazard. It may be difficult to perform and may, rarely, cause considerable discomfort.\r"
