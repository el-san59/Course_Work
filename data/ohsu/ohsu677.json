Two additional infants were studied while paralysed and ventilated. During the acute stage of the illness there was a significant reduction in forced expiratory flow rates and an increase in respiratory resistance. Although the mean thoracic gas volume for the group was increased, five infants did not compensate for their airways obstruction by hyperinflation. Curvilinear passive flow-volume curves were seen in three of the 14 non-ventilated infants and in both ventilated infants. At follow up three to four months later all passive flow-volume curves were linear. There was a significant reduction in hyperinflation and an increase in forced expiratory flow rates, but values still differed significantly from those in normal infants.\r"

The mean interval from onset of cerebral embolism to surgery was 5.3 (range 1-16) days. Five of the 14 patients had vegetations from infective endocarditis (including prosthetic valve endocarditis) as embolic sources, eight had intracardiac thrombi, and one had atrial myxoma. The diagnosed site of infarction before surgery was based on computed tomographic and/or angiographic findings. Of the 14 patients, four had infarcts due to major artery occlusion, seven due to cortical branch occlusion, and two due to perforating artery occlusion; one patient presented with a transient ischemic attack without computed tomographic abnormalities. Ten patients (71%) showed no clinical aggravation after open heart surgery; however, two patients died of massive cerebral hemorrhage, one died of deterioration of brain edema, and another became comatose from midbrain hemorrhage immediately after surgery. The four patients with clinical aggravation comprised three with septic embolism and one with aseptic occlusion of a major artery. From these results, infective endocarditis and a large infarct appear to be possible aggravating factors when patients with recent cerebral embolism undergo open heart surgery.\r"

In multiple stepwise logistic regression analyses, snoring was the only independent risk factor differentiating stroke occurring during sleep and stroke occurring either during sleep or during the first 30 minutes after awakening from stroke occurring at other times of the day. The risk ratios were 2.65 (95% confidence interval 1.32-5.29, p less than 0.005) and 3.16 (95% confidence interval 1.61-6.22, p less than 0.001), respectively. Other factors tested were age, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index. Arterial hypertension seemed to have an additive effect on the independent risk caused by snoring.\r"

Compared with those from controls, platelets from stroke patients contained significantly fewer alpha granules (p less than 0.001) and mitochondria (p less than 0.02) and showed a trend toward fewer dense bodies. Supportive of our previous studies, the amount of adenosine triphosphate secreted following stimulation by collagen also tended to be greater in platelets from stroke patients. These observations support the presence of increased platelet secretion associated with acute cerebral infarction and raise the possibility that platelet secretion may be of separate importance to the mechanical occlusion of blood vessels by platelet aggregates in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction.\r"

Approximately 90% of the patients were treated in the Department of Internal Medicine of Soderhamn Hospital. The protocols for physical rehabilitation and antithrombotic treatment changed between study periods. Between periods, 3-year survival after stroke increased by 16% (p less than 0.003). The 95% confidence intervals of the relative survival rates were 0.524-0.648, 0.435-0.567, and 0.337-0.475 at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, during the first period and 0.616-0.728, 0.600-0.732, and 0.576-0.748 during the second period. Fewer patients suffered fatal complications of stroke during the second period. The rate of stroke recurrence was approximately 10%/year during both study periods. Four patients suffered fatal hemorrhage during the first period, but no patient did so during the second period. Observed survival after transient ischemic attack did not differ from that expected in the first 2 years of follow-up during either study period. The risk for stroke after transient ischemic attack was approximately 5%/year during both periods. The higher survival rates after stroke during the second period seems to be the result of fewer fatal complications rather than of a reduced risk for recurrent stroke.\r"

Anastomoses were most frequent among the commissural arteries and in the distribution of the superior hypophyseal arteries and the tuberoinfundibular branches of the posterior communicating artery. The largest anastomoses were found among the tuberoinfundibular branches of the posterior communicating and internal carotid arteries, as well as among the premamillary arteries and the mamillary branches. We discuss the neurologic, neuroendocrinologic, and neurosurgical significance of the described anastomoses.\r"

Intracellular pH in these four cats was compared with that in nine cats subjected to a single 16-minute episode of complete global cerebral ischemia under hyperthermic conditions (mean +/- SD body temperature 40.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C). Intracellular pH during hyperthermic recirculation was significantly (p less than 0.03) greater in cats subjected to a previous ischemic event than that in cats subjected to only a single hyperthermic ischemic event.

In 13 dogs, dose-effect studies showed neurologic deficits (ranging from mild hemiparesis to death) related to the dose of microfibrillar collagen delivered. In another 10 dogs, 0.5 ml of 60 mg/ml microfibrillar collagen was injected into the common carotid artery; neurologic assessment over 48 hours revealed a survivable stroke syndrome in seven dogs, death at 40 hours in one dog and at less than 12 hours in another, and no clinical effect in one dog. The eight surviving dogs were sacrificed at 48 hours; nine of the 10 dogs had middle cerebral artery distribution infarcts (two grossly hemorrhagic and five grossly nonhemorrhagic) on histologic examination. Angiography in three dogs demonstrated no significant major vascular occlusion. All seven dogs with survivable strokes demonstrated a dense hemiparesis at 24 hours that improved to ambulatory status at 48 hours. The use of microfibrillar collagen to produce middle cerebral artery strokes in dogs provides a new opportunity to study cerebral ischemia without surgery involving the cervical or cranial vasculature. Dogs have larger brains than other common animal models and thus are more amenable to study with imaging modalities. A model with a measurable but survivable insult provides an opportunity for short- and long-term clinical follow-up and for the investigation of therapeutic interventions.\r"

Using silicone plastic plugs with a suture embedded within them, we embolized the middle cerebral artery in 19 dogs via the cervical carotid artery. The free end of the suture remained accessible in the neck, and after variable dwell times traction was placed on the suture and the plug was withdrawn. Placement of the plug in the middle cerebral artery produced ischemia in the basal ganglia. The degree and distribution of cortical ischemia were variable as evidence by the pathologically documented scattered nature of infarcts that resulted when the plug was left permanently in the middle cerebral artery and when it was removed after 1 or 2 hours. Angiography demonstrated occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with the plug in place as well as reperfusion when the plug was withdrawn. This modification of a previously described model of middle cerebral artery occlusion provides an opportunity to study structural, physiologic, and biochemical events occurring in acutely hypoperfused cerebral tissue as well as critical changes leading to irreversible injury without the disadvantages of surgical manipulation required by all previous models of reversible cerebral ischemia.\r"

In 60 rats anesthetized with chloral hydrate and maintained at one of three body temperatures, we unilaterally ligated the left common carotid artery and placed electrodes in the striatum to measure impedance (reflecting the extracellular space) during hypoxia, recovery, and/or cardiac arrest. We measured blood gases and pH at regular intervals during hypoxia in 47 rats and assessed blood-brain barrier function with Evans blue and tissue damage using Na+:K+ ratios. Shortly after hypoxia, impedance normalized in 24 rats without brain damage (normal Na+:K+ ratios, 4 hours of recovery). Sustained elevation of striatal impedance during recovery in six rats was related to an elevated Na+:K+ ratio and a disrupted blood-brain barrier. Damage was not obviously related to blood gases, pH, or the net reduction of the extracellular space during hypoxia. Hypothermia in 17 rats prevented impedance changes, and no striatal damage was found. Thus, irreversible brain damage very likely occurs during or very shortly after hypoxia. Persistent reduction of the extracellular space indicates tissue damage and can be used to monitor potential in vivo therapeutic measures.\r"

  ".W": "We produced unilateral photochemical infarcts in the hindlimb sensorimotor neocortex of 186 rats by intravenous injection of the fluorescein derivative rose bengal and focal illumination of the intact skull surface. Infarcted rats showed specific, long-lasting deficits in tactile and proprioceptive placing reactions of the contralateral limbs, mostly the hindlimb. Placing deficits were most prominent during transition to immobility and/or when independent limb movements were required. Administration of flunarizine, a Class IV calcium antagonist, 30 minutes after infarction resulted in marked sparing of sensorimotor function in 30 rats. In contrast to 20 vehicle-treated rats, which remained deficient for at least 21 days, 15 (75%) of the rats treated with 1.25 mg/kg i.v. flunarizine showed normal placing on Day 1 after infarction, whereas the remaining five (25%) recovered within 5 days. Oral treatment of 10 rats with 40 mg/kg flunarizine was also effective. Neocortical infarct volume and thalamic gliosis, assessed 21 days after infarction, did not differ between 30 flunarizine- and 30 vehicle-treated rats. However, when 4-hour-old infarcts were measured in 16 rats, posttreatment with intravenous flunarizine reduced infarct size by 31%. In combination with appropriate behavioral analyses, photochemical thrombosis may constitute a relevant stroke model, in which flunarizine preserved behavioral function during a critical period, corresponding to the spread of ischemic damage.\r"

  ".W": "We used the Fink-Heimer method to study degenerating corticofugal axons after unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion in 14 adult male Long-Evans hooded rats. Axonal degeneration in the pyramidal tracts was prominent at 1-3 weeks, manifesting in well-defined silver-impregnated axonal bundles coursing from the internal capsule to the pyramids and crossing completely to the contralateral spinal cord. In half of eight rats examined at 1-3 weeks, the cortical infarct included the forelimb region of the sensorimotor cortex, and degenerating corticospinal axons could be traced to the lower cervical segments; in rats with involvement of the hindlimb cortical area as well, axonal degeneration extended to the lumbosacral segments. Terminal degeneration products were present in the forebrain, midbrain, and brainstem within 2 days after arterial occlusion; the number of degenerating terminals peaked at 7 days and decreased gradually thereafter up to 6 weeks. Dense terminal degeneration was observed in the trigeminal nuclear complex of all seven rats studied at 2 and 7 days. In these seven rats, five had small cortical infarcts, and silver-impregnated terminals were observed in the lateral reticular formation; in two rats with large cortical lesions, terminal degeneration was prominent in the medial reticular formation as well. We conclude that infarcts produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion cause axonal degeneration in the brainstem and spinal cord. The Fink-Heimer method may be useful for evaluating the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model.\r"

Clinical features and the results of laboratory investigations led to the diagnosis of primary oxalosis. Two-dimensional echocardiography disclosed the presence of massive intracardiac calcifications compatible with deposition of calcium oxalate. The absence of other causes of stroke strengthened a cause-and-effect relation between cardiac oxalosis and cerebral infarction.

The surgery patients were randomized to receive RBCs stored either 3 to 8 or 20 to 42 days after donation. Of 38 patients receiving RBCs stored 8 days or less, 3 developed a rise in titer (4-fold increase) of IgG antibody to CMV 8 to 12 weeks after transfusion. This rate of response (8%) did not differ significantly (p = 0.23) from that (16%) in the 46 patients receiving RBCs stored 20 to 42 days. Seropositive oncology patients were randomized to receive RBCs from seronegative or random donors. Five (19%) of 27 oncology patients receiving seronegative RBCs and 13 (23%) of 55 patients receiving random RBCs (mean, 2 seropositive RBC units/patient) developed a rise in titer of antibody to CMV. No CMV morbidity occurred in either patient group. For both patient groups, a rise in titer of antibody to CMV was associated with the number of transfused RBC units. These results confirm that CMV-seronegative RBCs are unnecessary for infrequently transfused seropositive patients. They also suggest that multiple transfusions of stored RBCs are as immunosuppressive as multiple transfusions of RBCs used within a few days after donation.\r"

  ".W": "The number of cases of transfusion-associated acquired immune deficiency syndrome (TA-AIDS) that will be seen over the next few years is difficult to estimate, because of the uncertainty about the number of persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via blood transfusion and about the duration of the incubation period from HIV infection via transfusion to diagnosis of AIDS. Presented here are a mathematical model and nonparametric and parametric statistical analyses of recent data on TA-AIDS that indicate clearly the existing estimability problems. The methods provide short-term projections of new TA-AIDS cases to be reported; the results suggest about 1100 new cases to be reported in the United States between July 1988 and June 1989 and about 1500 more between July 1989 and June 1990. Estimates of the number of eventual TA-AIDS cases to be seen are considerably more uncertain and require additional assumptions about the incubation distribution. Under the assumption that the probability of an infected person developing AIDS within 8 years of infection is 0.40 (an estimation derived from cohort studies in homosexual men and hemophiliacs), parametric and nonparametric analyses give, respectively, point estimates of 14,300 and 15,000 for the number of eventual cases of AIDS (in the age group 13-69) attributable to infection by blood transfusion prior to July 1985. The parametric analysis gives a corresponding 95 percent confidence interval.\r"

However, the inappropriate use of autologous blood programs, which results in the collection of excessive quantities of blood or of the collection of any blood prior to low-risk surgical procedures, can be wasteful and potentially hazardous. All patients donating autologous blood at a large institution during a period of three months were studied in an effort to develop a schedule of optimal preoperative collection of autologous blood (SOPCAB), which is similar to a maximum surgical blood order schedule. Some 461 consecutive autologous donations from 264 patients were investigated. For certain surgical procedures, primarily the cardiac and orthopedic procedures, undercollection appeared to be the most common problem. For other procedures (laminectomies, nasal surgery), overcollection was more common. A model is presented for the careful scrutiny of autologous blood collection and use to allow for the creation of a SOPCAB for patients undergoing elective surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an uncommon, acquired clonal stem cell disorder primarily affecting red cells that have an abnormal sensitivity to complement lysis. Since 1948, the use of saline-washed red cells (WRBCs) has been advocated to minimize hemolysis after transfusion to patients with PNH. Thirty-eight years of experience (1950 through 1987) with patients who had PNH were reviewed. Twenty-three patients with a positive Ham's test had been transfused with 556 blood components, including 431 RBC products: 94 units of whole blood, 208 units of packed RBCs, 80 units of white cell-poor RBCs, 38 units of WRBCs, 5 units of frozen RBCs, and 6 units of intraoperatively salvaged RBCs. Only one documented episode of posttransfusion hemolysis related to the underlying diagnosis of PNH was found, and it was associated with the transfusion of a unit of type O whole blood to an AB-positive individual. This unit contained ABO-incompatible plasma; this case was similar to one in an earlier report from which originated the recommendation for using WRBCs. The posttransfusion increment in hemoglobin concentration in patients receiving ABO-identical packed RBCs was comparable to that in patients receiving frozen or washed RBCs. These findings indicate that the use of WRBCs is unnecessary and that patients with PNH should be transfused with group-specific blood and blood products.\r"

No significant difference was observed in autologous in vivo recovery (54 +/- 11 vs. 47 +/- 9%) or survival (167 +/- 37 vs. 170 +/- 25 hrs), as calculated by gamma function using 111In as radiolabel.

For individuals involved with volunteer blood donors, the most frequent route of parenteral exposure is needlestick injury with the phlebotomy needle. To assess the level of risk and possible avenues for prevention, 117 needlestick injury reports involving 72 employees were reviewed over a 2-year period (March 1983-March 1985) at a large blood center. Some 708,824 units of blood were collected over this period by more than 200 collection staff members. The incidence of needlestick injury for the study period was 0.0165 percent (1 in approximately 6000 collections). The activities most frequently associated with injury were the filling of the pilot tubes, removal of the needle from the pilot tubes, and performance of the hemoglobin fingerstick. As needlestick is a rare event and as the prevalence of infection is low among volunteer donors, the risk of acquiring HIV or hepatitis B is extremely small among blood collection staff. This information should serve to reassure employees who perform venipuncture.\r"

  ".W": "A nonradioisotopic method for measuring red cell volume that involves the use of 52Cr-sodium chromate as the red cell label and of graphite furnace atomic absorption analysis of chromium is described. The technique allows the labelling of 20 mL of packed red cells with 40 to 50 micrograms of sodium chromate (Na2CrO4) in 30 minutes at 22 degrees C with 94 +/- 6 percent uptake. Approximately 40 micrograms of Na2CrO4 was injected for in vivo studies. This results in posttransfusion in vivo red cell chromium levels after sample processing in the range of 1 to 7 micrograms per L, which could be quantitated accurately (coefficient of variation = 4.7%) by Zeeman electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The labeling concentration of chromium did not cause increased hemolysis, and the labeled cells exhibited an osmotic fragility curve similar to that of unlabeled, fresh ACD red cells. Red cell glutathione peroxidase was unaffected by labeling, although glutathione reductase was reduced by approximately 13 percent (p less than 0.05). The 52Cr red cell volume-measuring method was evaluated by concurrent in vivo studies with the standard 51Cr and 125I-albumin methods for that procedure. Simultaneous measurement of red cell volumes in seven volunteers by the 51Cr, 52Cr, and 125I-albumin techniques correlated highly with each other (r greater than 0.76), with mean values of 2294 +/- 199, 2191 +/- 180, and 2243 +/- 291 mL, respectively. The standard deviations of the differences were small: 134 mL for 52Cr versus 51Cr and 183 mL for 52Cr versus 125I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A recently developed nonradioisotopic 52Cr technique was used to measure either red cell volume or posttransfusion recovery of stored red cells. The experimental method uses Zeeman electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry to measure red cell chromium. Results from the 52Cr method were compared with those from 51Cr single-label and 125I-albumin/51Cr double-label procedures using 49-day AS-1 red cell concentrates drawn and prepared according to standard procedures. In the first group of five donors, red cell volume was estimated concurrently with both 52Cr-labeled fresh red cells and 125I-albumin. The latter measured plasma volume from which red cell volume was estimated on the basis of the hematocrit (125I red cell volume). 51Cr-labeled stored red cells were transfused to measure posttransfusion recoveries. The correlation between 52Cr and 125I red cell volumes was significant (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01), and, in this group, the differences were not significant (p less than 0.05). Twenty-four-hour posttransfusion recoveries of 51Cr-labeled stored red cells averaged 66 +/- 5 percent when measured with the 125I/51Cr technique and 69 +/- 8 percent when measured with the 52Cr/51Cr method. In the second group of five donors, red cell volume was estimated by the 125I-albumin technique, and the posttransfusion recovery of stored red cells was quantitated by 51Cr- and 52Cr-labeled stored cells simultaneously. In this group, posttransfusion recoveries with 125I/51Cr averaged 73 +/- 7 percent; with 125I/52Cr, they averaged 75 +/- 10 percent. Using the single-label method of calculation, recoveries averaged 76 +/- 7 and 75 +/- 10 percent for the 51Cr and 52Cr methods, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The decision is reached by analyzing a series of different events that lead to different outcomes. The probability of each event must be estimated and a value (\"utility\") assigned to specific outcomes. The underlying assumptions of the analysis are reviewed. After assigning a probability to each event and a utility to each outcome, one can compute a probability (P*) that is compared to the likelihood that the autologous donor will need transfusion. If the probability of transfusion exceeds P*, then keeping the infectious unit is favored. Otherwise, discarding the infectious unit is preferred. The analysis argues against a single, uniform national policy regarding the disposition of infectious autologous units. The method outlined provides a rational basis for setting policy regarding a controversial issue in Transfusion Medicine.\r"

They affirm that the results reported following partial nephrectomy are as good as those reported following radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. However, parenchyma-conserving surgery is usually performed only for relatively small, well-circumscribed tumors that do not involve the collecting system extensively or the renal hilum. To determine the results when radical nephrectomy is used to manage similar tumors, we reviewed the clinical records and arteriograms of 111 patients with renal cell carcinoma. Review of the arteriograms showed that parenchyma-conserving surgery could have been performed in 10 cases (9%). The disease-free survival rate for these 10 patients after radical nephrectomy was 100 percent, and they had no local recurrences. On the basis of these data, we believe that radical nephrectomy remains the best treatment for all patients who have renal cell carcinoma and a normal contralateral kidney.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of 166 male breech babies, 13 babies delivered by cesarean section did not show damage to the genital area. Of the 134 delivered vaginally, 19 showed injury to buttocks, scrotum, or testis. Ten babies (6.5%) showed damage to testis. On follow-up of three months to four years, the testis became normal to palpation in only 3 babies. In 1 baby, the testis became impalpable, leaving an empty scrotum. The testicular injury is more likely to occur in babies with a birth weight of greater than or equal to 2,500 g and born to primipara. The breech babies delivered vaginally should be examined and followed up for possible damage to testis. To avoid costly investigation and risky exploration, a history of breech delivery should be obtained in all cases presenting as anorchia, undescended testis, delayed sexual maturation, or male infertility.\r"

Most patients had renal, bladder, or testicular tumors. Of the 68 patients with negative screening chest roentgenograms, all but 2 had negative tomograms. One of these 2 patients had a normal chest film (the other had extrapulmonary metastasis), and he did not have the renal carcinoma initially suspected. Tomography discovered no metastases from urologic malignancy that was not already known about from the screening x-ray film. In 20 cases with a positive screening x-ray film, tomography was of limited value. It cleared two suspicious chest films and added information on extent of metastatic involvement in three. We conclude that whole-lung tomography adds little information not available by chest roentgenogram in our selected population, and with a negative screening chest film no additional chest study is needed.\r"

Total survival was longest in 26 patients who had objective responses (mean 50 months). Patients who failed to respond (n = 13) and those who had subjective responses (n = 13) survived an average of eleven and 17.2 months, respectively. Tumor burden was correlated with response to treatment and total survival; those judged to have a minimum tumor burden had objective responses and survived an average of sixty months. Sixteen other patients who had been previously treated with diethylstilbestrol were also studied. Nine of these had cardiovascular complications while taking diethylstilbestrol, and tolerated flutamide without further complications. Those in remission stayed in remission, and sexual potency returned to 5 patients.\r"

One hundred women, American Society of Anesthesiology physical status class I, undergoing ambulatory, elective termination of pregnancy were randomized to receive either butorphanol 2 mg plus diazepam 10 mg, or thiopental, until loss of the lid reflex occurred. The butorphanol/diazepam group received supplemental thiopental as necessary to attain adequate induction of anesthesia. The combination of butorphanol and diazepam significantly reduced the thiopental dose required to produce loss of the lid reflex, from 4.2 +/- 0.8 to 0.8 +/- 0.6 mg/kg (p less than 0.005), with 22 percent of the patients not requiring supplemental thiopental. The intraoperative course and anesthetic requirements were similar between the two groups. Lower recovery room rating scale values upon arrival at the recovery room were attributed to significantly higher weight-normalized doses of butorphanol (p = 0.004) and diazepam (p = 0.005). The duration of the recovery room stay was 68.8 +/- 24.9 min for the control group, and 80.8 +/- 29.0 min for the butorphanol/diazepam-treated patients (p = 0.026). There were no clinically significant differences in anesthesia or postanesthesia recovery. The combination of butorphanol and diazepam has a significant thiopental-sparing effect, and is a useful induction technique for short, ambulatory surgical procedures.\r"

Blood samples were drawn at time zero (just prior to dose), and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dosing. Nifedipine assays were performed by gas chromatography. The area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 hours and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) were significantly increased by food. Blood pressure was significantly decreased by food. The mean AUC for fasting and meal conditions were 315.0 and 411.4 ng.h/mL, and the mean Cmax were 42.6 and 86.6 micrograms/mL, respectively. The results indicate that food may increase the bioavailability of nifedipine sustained-release preparation.\r"

Approximately 75 minutes after ingestion of dipyridamole 300 mg suspension, the patient developed chest pain, hypotension, nausea, and diaphoresis. An electrocardiogram revealed ST-T wave changes suggestive of inferior ischemia. Appropriate therapeutic measures, including aminophylline and nitroglycerin, were instituted. Delayed thallium images revealed reversible ischemia in the anteroseptal and posterobasal regions with a fixed defect in the inferobasal region. Cardiac enzyme studies were also indicative of acute myocardial injury. The patient subsequently underwent coronary arteriography and four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and was discharged without further complication. This report raises concerns about the potential danger of dipyridamole in patients with severe coronary artery stenosis and collateral circulation. Prophylactic aminophylline should be considered in these patients.\r"

Her digoxin concentration increased from a trough of 1.9 to 5.1 nmol/L six days after the erythromycin was started. Digoxin was discontinued and restarted approximately six weeks later when the patient's atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure recurred. Her digoxin dose at this time was 0.125 mg/d and resulted in steady-state concentrations of 1.2, 1.4, and 1.2 nmol/L over the next year. Erythromycin inhibition of Eubacterium lentum, which converts digoxin into digoxin-reduction products in the gut, is the proposed mechanism of this interaction.\r"

Both amphotericin B and low-dose flucytosine (50 mg/kg/d) were concomitantly administered to the patient and his clinical symptoms improved. However, the combination therapy induced granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, which resolved after discontinuance of the drugs. Amphotericin B alone failed to cause granulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia. These results suggest that the mechanisms of granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia may be toxic reactions to flucytosine in the azotemic state caused by amphotericin B. Our report emphasizes the need for clinicians to monitor for granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving treatment with both amphotericin B and flucytosine, even when flucytosine is administered in a low dose.\r"

Zidovudine dosage reduction was not associated with concurrent therapy with either acetaminophen or acyclovir. Concomitant drug therapy was common, especially with systemic antifungals (47 percent), antivirals (33 percent), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (23 percent), and antidepressants (20 percent), as well as topical fungicides (35 percent) and antiinflammatory agents (28 percent). Over three-fourths of patients on zidovudine were on chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, most often with pentamidine inhalation therapy.

To continue leadership in the 21st century, the American pharmaceutical industry must make a stronger commitment to new product research and development and the profession of pharmacy must commit to development of services needed for new, high-technology products and devices that will often be parenterally administered, bulky, nontraditional, patient-tailored, infrequently administered, and device-oriented. It is suggested that pharmacy must initiate efforts to include drug administration as a pharmaceutical service. Other actions are suggested to modify the curricula preparing pharmacists and to recruit a wider variety of students. A number of other professional initiatives are recommended and discussed to position pharmacy for enhanced clinical services. The issue of subperformance by pharmacists is discussed by pointing out that there is a significant difference in what often is, what should be, and what could be pharmacy service.\r"

Eighty percent were from urine cultures, 12 percent from wound cultures, and 5 percent from sputum cultures. An antibiogram was developed that showed a pattern of bacterial resistance similar to that reported elsewhere. More than 80 percent of urinary tract infections were caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. More than 50 percent of skin and soft tissue infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus species. Susceptibilities of these organisms were compared with those reported by the local hospital, and antimicrobial resistance patterns were similar, which suggests that the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy can follow susceptibility patterns derived from either inpatient or outpatient laboratories in areas with similar resistance patterns. Further research into the epidemiology and susceptibility of organisms isolated from outpatients is needed. Whether the susceptibility of inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial resistance found in this investigation can be extrapolated to other geographic areas remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the rate of domestic violence against adult women by men partners. Two hundred eighteen women at two primary care clinics responded anonymously to a questionnaire. Forty-eight percent reported verbal abuse, 44 percent minor physical abuse, and 28 percent severe physical abuse. Abuse was common (16 percent) before marriage. Respondents whose partners were reported to be chemically dependent or sexually abusive were at greater risk for verbal and physical abuse. Respondents with lower socioeconomic status were at increased risk for verbal and physical abuse, as were women whose partners had less formal education. Ages of respondents and partners were not significant factors in abuse. Boyfriends not cohabitating were the least abusive, while couples together for 4 to 6 years had more domestic violence than other couples. Because spouse abuse is common and the consequences are devastating, it is important that family physicians become astute in making this diagnosis and initiate early treatment.\r"

Thirty-one percent had a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more, while 16 percent had a diastolic drop of 10 mmHg or more. Twelve percent had a significant drop in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure upon standing. Patients with both systolic and diastolic PH were more likely to have had a fall during the year prior to evaluation and decreased functional ability compared with those without PH. The group with systolic PH was more likely to have symptoms on standing and a history of weakness, but dizziness and lightheadedness were not correlated with PH. Postural hypotension occurred in only 13 percent of patients without risk factors for PH and in 35 percent of patients with risk factors. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Demographics and functional ability were similar between the risk factor groups. Thus, PH occurred frequently in our patients, could not be reliably predicted on the basis of risk factors or symptoms, and was correlated with a history of a recent fall and decreased functional ability.\r"

The oscillometric test instrument and a standard mercury manometer were connected with a Y tube. Paired t-tests were used to determine statistical differences between values obtained from the two instruments. Analyses were done by age, sex, and blood pressure range. While mean differences in blood pressure values were statistically significant in almost every instance, the quantitative differences were 5 mmHg or less with one exception. The differences, although statistically significant, were not great enough to be clinically important. We conclude that the Marshall 85 oscillometric sphygmomanometer is sufficiently accurate for limited use in the ambulatory care setting.\r"

  ".U": "90023058\r", 
  ".W": "Calcific tendinitis is a painful condition related to deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals; it favors large joints. The shoulder, specifically the tendons of the rotator cuff and the insertion of the long head of the biceps on the superior glenoid rim, is a well-recognized location for this abnormality. The purpose of this article is to describe a second site of calcific tendinitis of the biceps, distal to the joint and corresponding to the junction of the tendon and muscle. Radiographs in 119 cases of calcific tendinitis of the shoulder, obtained between 1980 and 1988, were reviewed. Twenty had calcific tendinitis in the region of the tendon of the long head of the biceps (nine at the glenoid insertion and 11 adjacent to the humeral shaft). All 11 patients with calcific tendinitis at the more distal site had a small, homogeneous deposit adjacent to the proximal humeral shaft. The densities in these 11 cases followed the normal course of the tendon of the long head of the biceps and were therefore medial to the proximal humeral shaft on the internal rotation view, lateral to the proximal humeral shaft on the external rotation view, and anterior to the proximal humeral shaft on the axillary projection. The major differential diagnosis of calcific tendinitis of the tendon of the long head of the biceps is loose bodies trapped in the biceps tendon sheath. Although the position of the soft-tissue densities in these two entities is similar, loose bodies have an appearance of bone, and their source (degenerative arthritis or recurrent dislocations) is usually apparent. A site of calcific tendinitis distal to the glenohumeral joint that is detectable on plain films is reviewed. Accurate diagnosis depends on understanding the anatomy of the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii. The clinical charts of the 11 patients also are summarized, with emphasis on the association between the roentgen finding and bicipital tendinitis and impingement syndrome.\r"

All 22 abnormalities of the anterior capsule were shown on the scans obtained with internal rotation. In no case were scans obtained in external rotation superior. Five posterior labral and capsule abnormalities were found; two of them were identified best or only on scans obtained with external rotation. The other three were shown equally well with the arm in either position. The results show that a modest (9%) increase in diagnostic yield can be expected when CT scans obtained with the arm in external rotation are added to studies performed solely with the arm internally rotated.\r"

It was apparent from examining these studies that the rate of occurrence of a normal posterior pituitary bright signal was lower than has been previously reported, particularly in older patients. This prompted both a retrospective and a prospective review and analysis of the posterior lobe bright signal in three patient categories. The overall frequency of posterior pituitary bright signal and the influence of sex and age were evaluated in one category. An age-related statistically significant decline in the frequency of posterior pituitary bright signal was found, with a decline rate of approximately 1% per year. An evaluation of the occurrence of anatomic variation in the location of posterior lobe bright signal was made in a second group of 1500 patients. Abberrant location of the posterior lobe was found to be uncommon and was seen most frequently in patients with a sellar fossula. Temporal variation in the presence or absence and size of the posterior lobe bright signal was evaluated in a third group of 36 patients who had at least two MR examinations available for review. Follow-up MR study showed an obvious posterior lobe bright signal in 8% of these patients for whom no bright signal was apparent at the time of initial examination. Loss of the posterior lobe bright signal was apparent in another 25% of patients. A significant change in size of the bright signal was apparent in 19% of patients within this category. Our results indicate that variation in the bright signal of the posterior pituitary lobe should be expected as a normal physiological occurrence.\r"

In group 1, the normal meninges were examined in 20 patients and were found to show fine linear enhancement in short segments, especially in a parasagittal distribution. In group 2, all gadolinium-enhanced head scans were reviewed retrospectively. Abnormal meningeal enhancement was detected in 52 patients. In some of these, the enhancement was associated with pathologic conditions of the meninges, including leptomeningeal tumor and meningeal infections and other inflammatory conditions; in others the enhancement was adjacent to subdural hematomas, subacute infarcts, and skull lesions, such as metastases or postoperative defects. In group 3, 30 cases of meningeal carcinomatosis were studied prospectively. Enhancement was seen in approximately two-thirds of cases and usually was quite diffuse and applied to the inner table of the skull. Frank nodules were seen less often. Contrast-enhanced CT was equal to MR in the detection of nodules but was nearly always unable to show diffuse meningeal enhancement against the inner table of the skull. Contrast-enhanced MR was more sensitive than contrast-enhanced CT in the examination of normal and abnormal meninges. Abnormal findings, such as meningeal carcinomatosis, were demonstrated more often by MR than by CT.\r"

We report 10 cases in which contrast-enhanced CT was used to diagnose correctly either main (seven cases) or segmental (three cases) posttraumatic renal artery occlusion. The abnormality was proved angiographically and/or surgically in all cases. CT showed the absence of a nephrogram in the devascularized portion of the kidney in all 10 cases. A pyelogram was not shown on CT in the seven patients in whom the main renal artery was occluded, but was present in the three patients who had segmental arterial lesions. Termination of enhancement within the affected artery (renal artery cutoff sign) was observed in one patient, and a thin, peripheral rim of cortical enhancement in an otherwise unenhanced renal segment (rim sign) was observed in three patients. Retroperitoneal hematoma with renal displacement was present in nine patients. Our experience suggests that the absence of a nephrogram on contrast-enhanced CT scans is a useful sign of main or segmental renal arterial occlusion in patients with blunt abdominal trauma.\r"

The coronary arteriograms in the 47 patients showed coronary involvement in seven (15%). Proximal or osteal lesions were present in six cases. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed successfully in eight patients for treatment of three aortic lesions, nine renal artery lesions, one subclavian artery lesion, and one coronary artery lesion. In the three cases with recurrence after 4-7 months, repeated angioplasty was successful. For appropriate management of Takayasu arteritis, we suggest thorough angiographic evaluation and proper intervention, including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in selected cases for revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "Members of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology and the Society of Uroradiology were surveyed to assess both current practice and determinants of use of low-osmolality contrast agents (LOCA). Of 715 questionnaires mailed, 229 were returned (32%). Many indicated that the responses referred to the practice of a group, rather than to an individual. Two thirds of the responses indicated that the choice of agent was made by the radiologist alone; one third shared the decision with administrators. Approximately 40% of respondents use written guidelines, but this percentage was higher when administrators were involved in the decision. Almost all (99%) obtained written informed consent--one third for all procedures that use contrast material and two thirds for angiographic studies only. Four percent noted the availability of LOCA in obtaining consent. Overall, LOCA were used for most angiographic procedures by 38% and for most IV studies by only 9% of respondents. All used them for at least some angiographic studies, and all but 2% used them for some IV studies. The major indications for use in both angiographic and IV studies were a prior major (but not minor) reaction and renal dysfunction. Anticipated patient discomfort also was important for intraarterial use. LOCA were used most often for peripheral and pulmonary arteriography. When LOCA were used, nonionic agents were preferred to low-osmolality ionic dimeric contrast agents for coronary angiography and venography, but this preference was essentially reversed for peripheral arteriography. This survey suggests that IV use of LOCA is much less frequent than intraarterial use and that use is individualized to certain risk factors and certain examinations. Guidelines for use are often in place, but this is clearly not universal. The importance of informed consent for use of contrast agents and of the appropriate role for LOCA remains unsettled.\r"

  ".W": "For a court to sustain a restrictive covenant with anticompetition as its major thrust does violence to our individual rights. There is no duty for a former employee not to compete as an incident of employment. Employers who seek to enforce restrictive covenants to protect their practice areas are asking the court to place on one side of the scales of justice the birthright of a newcomer to engage in the competitive marketplace and to place on the other side the right of the established group to have a public market area reserved exclusively for their benefit by prior claim. The court is being asked to take valuable legal rights to pursue competitive opportunities from one person or business and give them to the other person or business. In a legal sense, this is not easy to justify. Without something specific and private to protect other than public competitive opportunities, a restrictive covenant may violate public policy by casting a chilling effect on competition, may be abusive to constitutional equal protection, does violence to the concept of free enterprise, and tends to deny communities the services of highly trained professionals that may otherwise be hard to replace. The law of restrictive covenants varies from one state to another. Some jurisdictions have strayed from the traditional position detailed here and often are inclined to protect the employer's right to a service area for a specified term. The services of a local attorney should be obtained when it is necessary to deal with a contractual restrictive covenant.\r"

Chest radiographs typically reveal interstitial disease with normal lung volume. Pneumothorax and pleural effusions may be present. CT scans in eight patients with biopsy-proved pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis were reviewed. The prominent feature of the disease was multiple thin-walled cysts throughout the lungs, best visualized on scans made with 1.5-mm collimation. Mediastinal and/or retrocrural lymphadenopathy, often not appreciated on the chest radiograph, was present in four of eight patients. CT can suggest a diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis when diagnosis by clinical presentation and chest radiographs is uncertain.\r"

Treatment may fail if the catheter is not placed optimally within the loculation or if the fluid is hemorrhagic or fibrinous. We studied the value of transcatheter urokinase instillation in facilitating drainage of hemorrhagic or fibrinous nonhemorrhagic loculated pleural collections in 11 patients with 13 loculated pleural collections. Eight of the fluid collections were hemorrhagic, five were nonhemorrhagic. Five patients had had a thoracostomy tube placed surgically and all had had radiologically guided placement of single lumen drainage catheters managed with suction, saline irrigation, and mechanical guidewire manipulation. This therapy had failed to drain the loculations completely over an average of 10 days (range, 1-22 days). Urokinase (1000 units/ml) was instilled into the drainage catheters in 80- to 150-ml aliquots. After 1-2 hr, suction was reinstituted and the procedure was repeated. Twelve (92%) of the 13 collections were drained completely after an average of 4.3 instillations (range, three to eight instillations). Successful urokinase therapy required an average of 28 hr (range, 8-75 hr). In one case, therapy was discontinued after partial resolution for unrelated clinical reasons. There were no complications. These results suggest that transcatheter intracavitary urokinase therapy is a safe and effective method to facilitate drainage of loculated hemorrhagic or fibrinous nonhemorrhagic pleural fluid collections.\r"

Four patients were reexamined in 6 months; no change was seen in the size of the density. The density is thought to represent the medial portion of the pectoral muscle, which is included because of vigorous retraction of the breast and slight external rotation during positioning for the craniocaudal view. Familiarity with the appearance of the medial portion of the greater pectoral muscle on craniocaudal mammograms will help prevent inaccurate interpretations and unnecessary biopsies.\r"

Sixteen lesions were invasive carcinomas, and eight were ductal carcinomas in situ. In 96 lesions, the localizing wire was placed within 2 mm of the lesion, and in the remaining four it was within 5 mm of the abnormality. The mammographic lesion was excised in the first specimen in 96 cases. One patient required a second biopsy because of failure to excise the lesion in question after three specimens were taken. The only surgical complication was one hematoma, which resolved within 3 months. Median specimen volume for the entire series was 6.0 cm3. Median largest specimen diameter was 2.5 cm. Precise preoperative localization with a spring hookwire to within 2 mm of the mammographic lesion allows the surgeon to excise a median volume of 6 cm3 breast tissue with consistent retrieval of the lesion.\r"

Each matched set consisted of one image magnified 1.5 or 2.0 times by a microfocal spot; one contact film-screen mammogram; and one television-digitized, enhanced, and optically magnified contact film-screen mammogram. Three experienced mammographers and three senior diagnostic radiology residents with 2 weeks of training in mammography interpreted the calcifications. The average area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for the experienced mammographers was 0.60 for contact radiographs, 0.61 for the television-digitized images, and 0.69 for the microfocal-spot-magnified radiographs. The less experienced senior residents scored below a random choice, 0.44, for the television-digitized images; 0.51 for contact radiographs; and 0.69 for the microfocal-spot-magnified radiographs. We conclude that when evaluating microcalcifications, radiologists without extensive experience in mammography should not substitute television-digitized and enhanced contact mammograms for microfocal-spot-magnified mammograms; rigorous clinical evaluation is needed before this system is accepted for clinical use.\r"

All of our cases showed an anomalous union of the pancreatic duct and common bile duct, resulting in a long common channel. Review of cholangiopancreatograms also showed ectasia of the common channel in six of the eight patients. Mean length of the common channel, corrected for magnification, was 26 mm (normal, less than 15 mm). The mean corrected diameter of the common channel was 7 mm (normal, 3-5 mm). We conclude that ectasia of the common channel is an important additional radiographic observation in the diagnosis of choledochal cyst. This observation has not been emphasized before.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a randomized, blinded, prospective study evaluating hepatic parenchymal density changes during dynamic bolus CT (180 ml of contrast material given IV) and delayed CT (5 hr after 60 g of iodine) in order to compare the enhancement characteristics of an ionic contrast agent (iothalamate-60) and two nonionic agents (iohexol-300 and iopamidol-300). A total of 75 patients with known or suspected cancer were studied (25 patients per contrast agent). After a baseline unenhanced CT scan was obtained, dynamic bolus and delayed CT scans were obtained for all patients with one of the three contrast agents. The density of the liver and spleen was measured in Hounsfield units (H) for unenhanced CT, dynamic bolus CT, and delayed CT. The average percentage of enhancement was calculated as follows: postcontrast density minus precontrast density was divided by precontrast density and then multiplied by 100. For dynamic bolus CT, the average percentage of enhancement of the liver was 105% when iohexol-300 was used, 98% when iopamidol-300 was used, and 83% when iothalamate-60 was used. No significant difference was seen between the postcontrast enhancement of the three contrast agents on dynamic bolus CT scans (p greater than .05). For delayed CT, the average percentage of enhancement of the liver was 34% when iothalamate-60 was used, 28% when iopamidol-300 was used, and 16% when iohexol-300 was used. Both iothalamate-60 and iopamidol-300 showed superior enhancement on delayed CT, compared with iohexol-300 (p = .0001). We conclude that for dynamic bolus CT, all three contrast agents are similar, with no statistically significant differences in postcontrast enhancement of the liver. For delayed CT, however, hepatic enhancement with iothalamate-60 and iopamidol-300 is statistically superior to that with iohexol-300.\r"

Attenuation values of intraluminal filling defects of the IVC ranged from 38 to 42 H in four patients. High-attenuation intraluminal filling defects (60-70 H) of the IVC (five patients) and hepatic veins (one of five patients) were detected. Of these five patients, four had acute symptoms and one had chronic vague symptoms. The underlying disease was a web or band in the IVC and hepatic veins in three patients, invasive hepatocellular carcinoma in one, and injury to the IVC wall during hepatectomy in one. Inferior venacavography showed occlusion of the hepatic segment of the IVC in all five patients. Additional angiograms obtained by injection of contrast medium after a catheter tip was placed in the occluded hepatic IVC showed numerous filling defects suggestive of thrombi of recent onset, which correlated with the high-attenuation thrombi seen on CT scans in two patients. In the remaining three patients, high-attenuation areas in the IVC and hepatic veins also were considered to represent thrombi of recent onset because the attenuation values later decreased to 33-42 H. Spontaneous reduction in diameter of the thrombosed segment of the IVC was observed in four of the five patients. Knowledge of the CT features of acute thrombosis of the IVC and hepatic veins is useful in the early diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome.\r"

The patients with silent ischemia (group 1) were compared to: 124 CAD patients with both ST depression and angina (symptomatic ischemia, group 2); 159 CAD patients with neither ST depression nor angina (no ischemia, group 3); and 37 patients without CAD (controls). Survival at 7 years with medical therapy was similar for groups 1 (55%) and 2 (60%), but was substantially better for group 3 (73%, p = 0.001). Among group 1 patients with silent ischemia, survival was related to the severity of CAD (p = 0.001). Patients with silent ischemia and three-vessel CAD had a poor 7-year survival rate (37%) when treated medically. A comparable but non-randomized group of patients with silent ischemia and three-vessel CAD who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery had a much better 7-year survival rate (83%, p less than 0.0001). These results suggest that among patients with CAD and abnormal left ventricular function, silent ischemia adversely affects survival and can identify a higher risk subset of patients whose survival might be improved after coronary bypass surgery.\r"

The site of the infarction was anterior in 12 patients and inferior in eight patients. All 20 patients underwent repeated exercise radionuclide angiography 2 days later, 2 hours following oral intake of 120 mg of diltiazem. Double product was not significantly different before and after diltiazem, both at rest and during exercise. Maximal ST-T depression after diltiazem was reduced from 2.3 +/- 0.8 to 0.7 +/- 0.6 mm (p less than 0.01). Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction at rest before diltiazem was 54.4 +/- 8.7% and after diltiazem was 56.2 +/- 11.3% (p = NS). During exercise, LV ejection fraction improved after diltiazem from 43.2 +/- 12.2% to 49.8 +/- 10.5% (p less than 0.05). Regional wall motion score (1 = normal, 2 = hypokinetic, 3 = akinetic, 4 = dyskinetic) at rest before diltiazem was 9.6 +/- 2.0 and after diltiazem was 9.1 +/- 1.8 (p = NS). During exercise, regional wall motion score improved after diltiazem from 5.8 +/- 1.3 to 4.3 +/- 1.1 (p less than 0.02). We conclude that silent ischemia occurs in a substantial number of patients after myocardial infarction and that diltiazem has acute beneficial effects on asymptomatic ST-T depression and on global and regional LV function in post-infarction patients with silent ischemia.\r"

The left anterior descending coronary artery was distally ligated in 30 thoracotomized pigs for 45 minutes followed by 3 days of reperfusion. Infarct size was determined as the ratio of infarcted (tetrazolium stain) to ischemic (dye technique) myocardium. Regional myocardial function was assessed by sonomicrometry. Ten pigs received vitamin E acetate (12 gm intravenously three times for 1 week) before ischemic and vitamin C (4.4 gm intravenously) before reperfusion (therapy A). Another 10 pigs were treated with vitamin E acetate (12 gm intraarterially) and vitamin C (4.4 gm intravenously) during ischemia (therapy B). An additional 10 pigs served as a control group. Global hemodynamics did not differ significantly among the groups before and during ischemia. Mean plasma concentrations of vitamin E amounted to 107 micrograms/ml in group A, 16 micrograms/ml in group B, and 0.9 micrograms/ml in the control group at the onset of reperfusion.

In spite of this evidence for reduced severity of myocardial ischemia, ST elevation is frequently observed on the electrocardiogram. To determine if Fluosol produces ST segment elevation by a mechanism other than myocardial ischemia, closed-chest dogs underwent three interventions: (1) an infusion of oxygenated Fluosol into the unoccluded left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery; (2) an identical infusion of unoxygenated Ringer's lactate; and (3) a transient occlusion of the LAD coronary artery. Open-artery infusions were chosen to minimize ischemia by permitting antegrade coronary blood flow. ST segments were monitored continuously and contrast left ventriculography was performed to assess regional systolic function. Coronary occlusion for 1 minute resulted in significant ST segment elevation from baseline (0.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.6 mm, p less than 0.05) and marked depression in regional ejection fraction (45 +/- 7% to -3 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). Infusion of Fluosol produced a similar degree of ST segment elevation (0.9 +/- 0.3 to 2.8 +/- 0.4 mm, p less than 0.05), but no change in regional ejection fraction. Ringer's lactate infusion also resulted in ST segment elevation associated with preservation of regional contractility. Because regional systolic function (a sensitive indicator of regional ischemia) was preserved and an open-artery infusion was used, it is concluded that intracoronary infusion of Fluosol causes ST segment elevation by a mechanism other than myocardial ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dipyridamole significantly reduced systemic vascular resistance (1218 +/- 302 to 739 +/- 166 dyne/sec-1/cm-5; p less than 0.05) and increased cardiac index (3.1 +/- 0.7 to 4.7 +/- 1.0 L/min/m2; p less than 0.05) within approximately 10 minutes, in association with a significant increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (13 +/- 5 to 17 +/- 6 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). Three patients developed silent new \"V\" waves in their pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracing, associated with anterior thallium redistribution.

The percent change in the right ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) at CLs of 600 and 400 msec was significantly greater in responders than in nonresponders: 14.6 +/- 6.9% versus 7.9 +/- 7.3% (p = 0.0414) for ERP at a CL of 600 msec and 15.1 +/- 7.0% versus 8.0 +/- 7.4% (p = 0.0386) for ERP at a CL of 400 msec. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that greater percent increase in ERP at a CL of 400 msec and lesser percent increase in paced QRS duration at a CL of 400 msec were significantly independent markers for the responders. These findings suggest that lesser slowing of conduction and greater prolongation of refractoriness by procainamide tend to abolish reentry within the reentrant circuit. Greater slowing of conduction and lesser prolongation of refractoriness tend to stabilize a reentrant circuit, and promote the continued induction of VT.\r"

  ".W": "Sequential pulse internal defibrillation delivered via orthogonal current pathways has been postulated to improve defibrillation efficacy. The efficacy of twin truncated exponential sequential shocks was compared in four different defibrillation electrode configurations in six pentobarbital-anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Lead systems consisted of the conventional single current pathway spring-patch and patch-patch electrode configurations, as well as a multiple patch lead configuration, which utilized either a single (multiple patch-unswitched) or two different (multiple patch-switched) current pathways. Curves of percent successful defibrillation versus initial voltage and energy were constructed and the data were analyzed by logistic regression. The energy and initial voltage required for 50% successful defibrillation (E50 and V50, respectively) for each lead system were then compared. The E50 for the multiple patch-unswitched and switched lead systems (4.3 +/- 1.5 J and 4.6 +/- 1.7 J, respectively) were significantly lower than for the spring-patch (9.0 +/- 3.1 J; p less than .005) and patch-patch (6.6 +/- 1.2 J; p less than .005) lead systems. In addition, the V50 for the multiple patch-unswitched lead configuration (270.6 +/- 48.4 V) was significantly lower than that of all other lead systems (p less than .005). Therefore lead configurations utilizing multiple patch electrodes improve defibrillation efficacy over conventional lead systems, but there is no advantage to \"switched\" current pathways.\r"

The isovolumic relaxation time constants (TL and TD) were calculated by mean of a zero (TL) and variable (TD) asymptote pressure. The chamber stiffness constants were derived from the diastolic pressure-diameter (kd) and pressure-volume (kv) relationships. The extrasystolic beat was associated with marked impairments of relaxation, systolic function, and diastolic filling as seen by an increased TL (53 to 71 msec; p less than 0.001), TD (59 to 89 msec; p less than 0.005), time from maximum negative dp/dt to the lowest diastolic pressure (147 to 170 msec; p less than 0.05), and decreased number of elasped TDs (3.1 to 2.4; p less than 0.05), end-systolic pressure-diameter ratio (2.4 to 1.7; p less than 0.001), maximum positive dp/dt (1904 to 1326 mm Hg/sec; p less than 0.001), shortening fraction (31% to 21%; p less than 0.001), and peak early filling velocity (59 to 49 cm/sec; p less than 0.001).

Antiarrhythmic treatment was discontinued before the study. Hypertrophy was septal in 33 patients, \"extensive\" (i.e., involving the septum and free wall) in 38 patients, and predominantly apical in six patients. Lown grade I and II ventricular arrhythmias were detected in 37% of patients, grade III in 21%, and grade IV in 29%. Atrial extrasystoles were seen in 52% of patients and chronic atrial fibrillation in 13%. More serious ventricular arrhythmias (Lown grades III and IV) occurred significantly more frequently in patients with extensive than in those with only septal hypertrophy (22/38 vs 11/33; p less than 0.001); similarly, chronic atrial fibrillation occurred more commonly in those with extensive hypertrophy (9/38 vs 1/33; p less than 0.01). During a mean follow-up period of 2.6 years, three patients died. All had a pattern of extensive hypertrophy. Two of them had ventricular tachycardia and the third had chronic atrial fibrillation. Results of this study suggest that an echocardiographic finding of extensive hypertrophy represents a useful marker for detecting patients at increased risk for serious ventricular and atrial arrhythmias.\r"

The increase in systemic vascular resistance of 30% with ouabain was ablated by prior diltiazem. Heart rate did not significantly change with ouabain or with diltiazem plus ouabain, but intravenous diltiazem alone produced a reflex increase in heart rate of 26%. Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension was significantly greater with ouabain alone, but not with ouabain after pretreatment with diltiazem. LV dP/dt max increased by 40% with ouabain alone, but by only 23% (p less than 0.001) after pretreatment with diltiazem plus ouabain. When observed at matched preload and heart rate, diltiazem markedly attenuates the positive inotropic and peripheral arterial constrictive effects of acute ouabain administration in the conscious animal with normal LV function.\r"

  ".W": "Functional mitral regurgitation plays a major role in determining the therapeutic response to vasodilators in patients with severe congestive heart failure. Its role in the response to inotropic therapy has not been studied in these patients. Ten patients with stage 3 or 4 congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class) and secondary mitral regurgitation were studied before and during intravenous administration of dobutamine (mean dose, 7.4 microgram/kg/min). Hemodynamic measurements were obtained invasively. Echo and Doppler cardiography were used to determine cardiac volumes. Mitral regurgitation was calculated as the difference between total stroke volume by echo and forward stroke volume by Doppler. Mitral regurgitation area was calculated from a modified hemodynamic formula. Dobutamine caused a marked rise in mean forward stroke volume (43 to 61 ml), with a decrease in mitral regurgitation volume from 20 to 10 ml/beat and a drop in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure from 21 to 13 mm Hg. Since the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and atrium increased significantly during dobutamine therapy, only a marked decrease in the orifice of regurgitation could explain the changes in regurgitant volume. Indeed, the end-diastolic volume decreased from 254 to 234 ml and the orifice of mitral regurgitation was reduced from 0.25 to 0.12 cm2.\r"

In 15 patients with normally functioning prostheses, valve area at rest was 2.4 +/- 0.25 cm2 in the BS patients and 1.8 +/- 0.35 cm2 in the SE group (p less than 0.01). In the SE group, peak and mean gradients increased from 8 +/- 1 and 5 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively, at rest to 22 +/- 5 and 13 +/- 4 mm Hg at peak exercise (mean +/- 1 SD). In the BS group, peak and mean gradients increased from 10 +/- 3 and 5 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, at rest to 16 +/- 3 and 10 +/- 3 mm Hg at peak exercise. Peak pressure gradient at peak exercise and the increase in peak gradient with exercise (exercise-resting gradient) were significantly higher in the SE group (p less than 0.05). By plotting the heart rate versus the transmitral gradient during the recovery period, a heart rate-gradient curve was obtained for each type of prosthesis. Doppler echocardiography with moderate supine exercise can be performed in most patients with mechanical prosthesis. Hemodynamic properties (the occlusive character of the SE prosthesis) were brought out by exercise. Doppler echocardiographic measurements during exercise can provide important information, particularly in patients with borderline measurements at rest.\r"

In order to assess the accuracy of identification and measurements of the signal void in the evaluation of mitral (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR), the cine MRI studies of 62 patients with regurgitation and of 20 normal volunteers were retrospectively analyzed in a blinded study of three independent reviewers. Accuracy for detection of MR was greater than 0.96 and for AR was greater than 0.91 for all three reviewers. The total volume of the signal void associated with regurgitation was measured on cine MRI images of 58 patients by two independent observers. The patients were divided into three groups of severity based upon assessment of severity of regurgitation by two-dimensional echocardiography and/or angiography. The total volume of signal loss was 9.0 ml (+/- 0.94 SEE; n = 18) for mild MR, 30.7 ml (+/- 5.3 SEE; n = 11) for moderate MR, and 83.4 ml (+/- 17.4 SEE; n = 5) for severe MR.

Newly diagnosed cases were ascertained from four Baltimore hospitals and were interviewed along with neighborhood controls identified using a random digit dialing technique. The cases and controls (N = 190) were matched on sex and 5-year age intervals and were compared in the analysis using matched and unmatched estimates of the relative odds and conditional logistic regression methods. A statistically significant, independent association was observed between idiopathic DCM and a history of asthma (p less than 0.05). The association was most pronounced among individuals who were less than 55 years of age (relative odds = 20.3, p less than 0.05), with 31.1% (14 of 45) of the patients who were under the age of 55 having a reported history of asthma. These findings support the theory that hypersensitivity mechanisms may be important in the development of idiopathic DCM. A treatment effect associated with asthma is an alternative possibility.\r"

  ".W": "Increased plasma catecholamine levels assessed from the venous blood have been found in a number of studies of younger patients with essential hypertension, but hypertensive-normotensive differences could not easily be demonstrated in subjects above 40 years of age. For several reasons, measurement of arterial plasma catecholamines may be a more sensitive tool for the detection of hypertensive-normotensive differences. The present study therefore aimed at examining both venous and arterial plasma catecholamines in a group of white men, all 50 years of age, with never-treated, established essential hypertension (n = 61, blood pressure 165 +/- 2/112 +/- 1 mm Hg, means +/- SE) and comparing them with a similar group of normotensive men (n = 51, blood pressure 128 +/- 1/85 +/- 1 mm Hg). Arterial and venous plasma epinephrine, heart rate, and body weight were significantly elevated in the hypertensive group. Plasma norepinephrine was similar between the groups in the venous blood, whereas in the arterial blood the values in hypertensive subjects were moderately, but significantly increased (p less than 0.03). However, stepwise multiple regression analysis suggested arterial plasma norepinephrine was the only significant independent explanatory variable of raised blood pressure in the hypertensive group (r = 0.51, t = 4.05, p = 0.0002). Such a relationship was not found in the normotensive group. Thus based on measurements in arterial blood, we conclude that plasma norepinephrine, representing sympathetic tone, may be an important pathogenetic factor for high blood pressure in middle-aged men with established hypertension.\r"

Elevated BP values during the awake hours (greater than 140/90 mm Hg) and sleeping hours (greater than 120/80 mm Hg) were used to calculate the total percentage of abnormal BP values (load) in each patient. The relationship between BP load and several indexes of hypertensive cardiac target organ involvement was compared to the relationships among office (casual), 24-hour average BP values, and cardiac indexes. Casual systolic and diastolic BP values did not correlate with left ventricular mass index, left atrial index, or peak left ventricular filling rate. Both 24-hour average BP and systolic and diastolic BP loads correlated with all indexes of cardiac target organ involvement. The BP loads were related to left ventricular mass index and left atrial index more strongly than were the mean 24-hour BP values; however, they were equally correlated for peak left ventricular filling rate. If greater than 40% of the ambulatory BP values were elevated, the likelihood of increased mass or decreased filling was greater than 61%, whereas if less than 40% of the BP values were elevated, the incidence of an abnormal cardiac test result decreased to less than 17%. These data show that the percentage of elevated BP values that includes both the awake and asleep periods is predictive of cardiac target organ involvement in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Patients with mild hypertension who have more than 40% abnormal BP values should strongly be considered for antihypertensive therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have found 2-dimensional echocardiography and conventional spectral Doppler ultrasound useful in the assessment of ventricular septal defect (VSD), but few data exist regarding the usefulness of color Doppler flow imaging in evaluating this problem. Thus, the results of color flow imaging performed in 14 patients who presented with a recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI), hemodynamic instability and a new systolic murmur were evaluated. All patients underwent cardiac catheterization for definitive diagnosis, which proved to be VSD in 7 and acute mitral regurgitation in 7. VSD, identified by turbulent flow traversing the ventricular septum during ventricular systole, was correctly identified in all 7 patients with septal rupture. In the remaining 7 patients with a new murmur after AMI, mitral regurgitation was demonstrated as turbulent systolic flow in the left atrium by both color flow imaging and cine ventriculography. In all 14 patients with new murmurs, color flow imaging was 100% accurate for the presence or absence of VSD. Color flow imaging localized the septal defect to the apical septum (3), inferior septum (3) or both inferior and apical septal regions (1), and was 100% concordant for location compared with cineangiography, surgery and conventional Doppler echocardiographic techniques. Color flow imaging was accurate in identifying the presence and location of VSD complicating AMI, and accurately differentiated VSD from mitral regurgitation. Color flow imaging provides safe, rapid diagnosis of VSD complicating AMI, and may alleviate the need for diagnostic right-sided heart catheterization and preoperative cine ventriculography in these seriously ill patients.\r"

The discriminant power of 2 different models (LVEF at rest alone vs LVEF at rest plus LVEF at peak exercise) was quantified in terms of the area under receiver-operating characteristic curves based on knowledge of patient outcome in the year after testing and the logistic probability of that outcome. Although LVEF at rest provided a significant amount of prognostic information (receiver-operating characteristic curve area = 62 +/- 4%, p less than 0.001), several limitations were observed: (1) powerful predictors of risk were uncommon (32% of patients with an LVEF at rest less than 0.20 had a cardiac event, but only 3% of the population had such extreme values); (2) the accuracy of predictions for high risk patients was less than for low risk patients (28 vs 98%, p less than 0.001); (3) addition of exercise LVEF to the model did not improve the accuracy of prediction (receiver-operating characteristic curve area = 68 +/- 4%, p = 0.11); and (4) predictions for individual patients were very imprecise (the 95% confidence interval of percent risk for an LVEF at rest of 0.20 [11 to 36%] overlapped that for an LVEF at rest of 0.60 [0 to 14%]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At a mean follow-up duration of 11 +/- 7 months, and a mean dosage of 1,415 +/- 698 mg/day, the group had a 13% reduction in total cholesterol, 31% increase in HDL and 32% decrease in the cholesterol to HDL ratio.

A subgroup of 39 patients taking less than or equal to 1,000 mg/day of niacin had only a 5% reduction in total cholesterol, although a 29% increase in HDL and a 24% decrease in the cholesterol to HDL ratio were recorded.

In this study esophageal pill electrode atrial pacing was used as a myocardial stress not requiring exercise, and changes in ejection fraction and pressure volume ratio during pacing with 2-dimensional echocardiography were quantitatively analyzed. All patients had completed a Bruce protocol treadmill exercise test and had undergone coronary arteriography. Of 26 patients, 22 were successfully paced (85%). Comparable rate-pressure products were obtained for treadmill exercise (23,500 +/- 5,900 mm Hg/min) and pacing (24,100 +/- 4,400 mm Hg/min; difference not significant). Of the 22 patients completing the study 8 had normal coronary arteries (group I) and 14 had CAD (group II). The change in ejection fraction with pacing in group I patients was not significant (3 +/- 8%). In group II ejection fraction decreased with pacing (-8 +/- 13%; p = 0.025). The pressure/volume ratio increased in group I with pacing (3.8 +/- 1.8 mm Hg/min/m2; p = 0.05) and was unchanged in group II (0.3 +/- 1.8 mm Hg/min/m2; difference not significant). Using an ejection fraction decrease with pacing or a failure to increase pressure/volume ratio with pacing as criterion for the presence of CAD, similar predictive accuracies were obtained when compared to treadmill exercise testing. Esophageal pill electrode atrial pacing with quantitative 2-dimensional echocardiography may be a useful noninvasive, nonexercise method to detect CAD.\r"

The static loads in the 2 tests were matched by percentage of maximal static effort and corresponded to 25 and 45% of maximal voluntary handgrip contraction and 25 and 45% of maximal 1-hand lift capacity. Each static load in both tests was continued for less than or equal to 3 minutes. At the 25% maximal effort stage, 93 and 90% of patients were able to complete 3 minutes of handgrip and weight carrying, respectively. Only 13 and 10% were able to complete 3 minutes at the 45% maximal effort stage with handgrip and weight carrying, respectively. Arm fatigue and an increase in diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mm Hg were the predominant endpoints. Weight carrying resulted in significantly higher (p less than 0.05) heart rate, systolic blood pressure, pressure-rate product, ventilation and oxygen consumption compared to handgrip. Diastolic blood pressure responses did not differ between the tests. None of the patients demonstrated ischemic responses to either handgrip or weight carrying and the incidence of arrhythmias was rare. The diastolic blood pressure response to static effort is equally evaluated by handgrip and weight carrying tests. However, the greater myocardial oxygen demand, reflected by the pressure-rate product, in addition to the greater total body oxygen consumption, imposed by weight carrying, enhances the clinical application of the weight carrying test.\r"

Self-adhesive, dual function electrocardiogram/defibrillator pads were used to assess the effect of electrode pad size on defibrillation success with low energy (200 J) shocks. The study analyzed 123 cardiac arrests due to primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 105 patients (74 men, 31 women) ages 40 to 84 years (mean 64). Transthoracic impedance was measured before defibrillation using a low amplitude 30-kHz current passed through the chest by way of the electrocardiogram/defibrillator pads applied anteroanteriorly. Pad diameters were small (8/8 cm) in 26 cardiac arrests, intermediate (8/12 cm) in 63 arrests and large (12/12 cm) in 34 cardiac arrests. Transthoracic impedance decreased with increasing pad size (112 +/- 17 vs 92 +/- 22 vs 72 +/- 14 omega, respectively, p = 0.0001). Only the first episode of primary VF during a cardiac arrest was analyzed. A single shock of 200 J (delivered energy) was successful in 8 of 26 (31%) arrests using small pads, in 40 of 63 (63%) with intermediate pads and in 28 of 34 (82%) with large pads (p = 0.0003). A second 200-J shock increased the cumulative defibrillation rates to 12 of 26 (46%), 50 of 63 (79%) and 33 of 34 (97%), respectively (p less than 0.0001). In primary VF, larger self-adhesive electrocardiogram/defibrillator pads are associated with a lower transthoracic impedance and improved defibrillation success rates with low energy shocks.\r"

Of 4 patients who died less than 1 year after operation (mortality 13%), 1 death was related to an arrhythmia. Three patients were not in sinus rhythm before operation and were excluded from the statistical analysis that examined predictors of arrhythmias. The remaining 23 long-term survivors have been followed 6.3 +/- 2.6 years (mean +/- standard deviation) since surgery and all remain in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. Ten patients (43%) developed immediate postoperative arrhythmias (less than or equal to 30 days) whereas 11 (48%) had late arrhythmias. With up to 10.7 years of follow-up, the proportion of patients free from late arrhythmias continues to decline. Arrhythmias included bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachyarrhythmias, the tachy-brady syndrome and supraventricular ectopic activity. Immediate postoperative arrhythmias predicted late arrhythmias (p = 0.022). The preoperative electrocardiogram was the only variable useful in predicting both immediate and late postoperative arrhythmias. A more negative P-wave deflection in lead V1 (-2.4 +/- 0.7 vs -1.4 +/- 1.2 mV, p = 0.02) predicted patients with immediate postoperative arrhythmias, whereas both greater P-wave duration and a more negative deflection in this lead predicted late arrhythmias (103 +/- 14 vs 83 +/- 20 ms, p = 0.01, and -2.5 +/- 0.8 vs -1.3 +/- 1.0 mV, p = 0.005, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A retrospective chart review was performed of 223 patients with univentricular heart and 113 with classic tricuspid atresia evaluated from 1982 to 1987. Thirty-four patients with univentricular heart and 17 with tricuspid atresia had no siblings and were excluded. Eleven of the total 388 siblings (2.8%) of the 189 patients with univentricular heart had a congenital heart defect. Of the siblings born after the index case of univentricular heart, 7 of 169 (4.1%) had a congenital heart defect. Two of the 210 siblings (1.0%) of the 96 patients with tricuspid atresia had a congenital heart defect. The patients with univentricular heart were subdivided into 4 groups: (1) double-inlet left ventricle; (2) complex univentricular heart with single or common inlet, or with a ventricle of common or right ventricular morphology; (3) complex univentricular heart with asplenia; and (4) complex univentricular heart with polysplenia. One of the 202 siblings (0.5%) of the 102 patients with double-inlet left ventricle had a congenital heart defect, compared with 7 of the 140 siblings (5.0%) of the 69 patients with complex univentricular heart, 1 of the 29 siblings (3.4%) of the 14 patients with complex univentricular heart and asplenia, and 2 of the 7 siblings (28.6%) of the 4 patients with complex univentricular heart and polysplenia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical responses, systemic hemodynamics and electrocardiographic changes were determined, with quantitative arteriography used for sequential measurement of proximal right coronary dimensions. A progressive decrease in proximal right coronary diameter was observed, with average control values and final diameters equaling 3.25 +/- 0.49 and 2.56 +/- 0.49 mm, respectively, thus representing an overall -21.2% change from baseline. No significant differences existed in control dimensions when analyzed with respect to gender (3.20 +/- 0.59 vs 3.40 +/- 0.72 mm, women vs men, difference not significant), although women demonstrated a greater decrease from baseline values (0.80 +/- 0.30 vs 0.50 +/- 0.24 mm, women vs men, p less than 0.05). The presence of minor atherosclerotic disease, as determined by the presence of minor (less than 30% diameter) luminal irregularities within the right coronary artery, failed to alter control dimensions (3.30 +/- 0.48 vs 3.20 +/- 0.51 mm, normal vs atherosclerotic persons, difference not significant), but was associated with more ergonovine-induced coronary vasospasm (0.41 +/- 0.27 vs 0.84 +/- 0.21 mm, normal vs atherosclerotic persons, p less than 0.01). Therefore, sequential intravenous ergonovine maleate infusion resulted in progressive, nonspecific reductions in proximal right coronary artery dimensions in subjects without a history compatible with vasospastic angina. This nonspecific vasoconstrictor effect was accentuated in women and subjects with intimal irregularities suggestive of minor atherosclerotic coronary disease.\r"

In 40 patients (26 men, 14 women, ages 34 to 73 years), cardiac output was measured simultaneously by thermodilution and the Fick method using the metabolic rate meter to quantitate oxygen consumption. In comparison with thermodilution, the results using the Fick method were low (5.26 +/- 1.18 vs 4.14 +/- 0.99 liters/min, respectively, p less than 0.01). In 18 patients cardiac output also was measured by the Fick method using a Douglas bag to quantitate oxygen consumption. In these patients, oxygen consumption measured with the metabolic rate meter was lower than that obtained using the Douglas bag (168 +/- 25 vs 216 +/- 42 ml/min, respectively, p less than 0.01). With the Douglas bag, the Fick and thermodilution cardiac output measurements were similar (4.68 +/- 1.08 vs 4.87 +/- 0.86 liters/min, respectively, difference not significant), and they differed by less than or equal to 10% in 15 patients. In contrast, with the metabolic rate meter, the results of thermodilution were higher than those with the Fick method (4.84 +/- 0.95 vs 3.60 +/- 0.71 liters/min, respectively, p less than 0.01), and differed by less than or equal to 10% in only 1 patient (p less than 0.01). Thus, the values for oxygen consumption and cardiac output obtained with the metabolic rate meter are lower than actual values. This device is less accurate than the Douglas bag.\r"

  ".W": "The ear densitogram was monitored in 21 consecutive patients with various degrees of myocardial function (New York Heart Association class I to IV) during the standardized Valsalva maneuver to evaluate the quantitative relations between the pattern of response and the central circulatory pressures. The ear densitographic first derivative consistently tracked the aortic pulse pressure during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver (beat-to-beat correlation [r] range 0.98 to 0.72). The percent decrease of the densitographic pulse derivative during strain correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure at rest (r = 0.62, p less than 0.001), but not with cardiac output, cardiac index and ejection fraction. Multiple stepwise regression was used to take into account multiple aspects (time intervals and pulse amplitudes) of the pattern of response to the Valsalva maneuver. As a result, both correlations improved substantially (r = 0.97, p less than 0.001 for left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and r = 0.92, p less than 0.001 for pulmonary artery wedge pressure). In conclusion, the combination of several noninvasive indexes obtained by pulse amplitude and interval changes during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver seems to be a new and promising method for noninvasive evaluation of the status of left ventricular filling pressures.\r"

A Doppler computer, calibrated for the aortic diameter and the transcutaneously measured cardiac output from the suprasternal notch, computed the Doppler cardiac output from the descending aortic blood flow velocity signal. A total of 246 paired Doppler cardiac output and thermodilution cardiac output measurements were made in 14 patients during surgery. The average thermodilution cardiac output was 5.90 +/- 3.27 (standard deviation) liters/min (range 1.20 to 19.18); the average Doppler cardiac output was 6.21 +/- 4.0 liters/min (range 2.30 to 28.20). The difference between the cardiac output measured by the 2 techniques was 1.38 +/- 2.2 liters/min (range 0.04 to 16.8). Two to 5 cardiac output measurements were averaged and arranged into \"time periods.\" The average standard deviations for thermodilution and Doppler cardiac outputs within each time period were 0.64 and 0.47 liters/min, respectively. There was a correlation between the 2 measurements over a range of cardiac output values (r = 0.76, Doppler cardiac output = 0.93 x thermodilution cardiac output +0.7, standard error of the estimate = 1.76). Reproducible measurements of Doppler cardiac output were obtained during intraobserver (mean difference 0.64 +/- 0.52 liter/min) and interobserver (mean difference 0.41 +/- 0.36 liter/min) studies (n = 8). Cardiac output measurement by the Doppler esophageal probe could be used for hemodynamic monitoring during surgery in selected patients with cardiopulmonary disease.\r"

The effects of beta 1-adrenergic blockade with optimal dose metoprolol were then assessed. Data were analyzed using Fourier transformation, autocorrelation and cross-correlation to examine possible coupling between heart rate and ischemic electrocardiographic changes. A marked circadian pattern was observed for both heart rate and ambulatory myocardial ischemia, with a period of approximately 24 hours by both Fourier and autocorrelation methods. Cross-correlation revealed heart rate and ischemia to be tightly coupled with a lag of 0 hours during placebo. During beta 1 adrenergic blockade the marked circadian variation in heart rate was diminished, although some periodicity in the 24-hour region remained. Ambulatory ischemia was also markedly diminished during beta 1-adrenergic blockade; however, some residual ischemia remained that was characterized by a peak spectral activity shifted to a period of 5 to 7 hours. Heart rate and ischemia were not coupled during beta 1-adrenergic blockade, as evidenced by lack of significant cross-correlation. Thus, time series analysis suggests close coupling between the variation in heart rate and ambulatory ischemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease. Beta 1-adrenergic blockade can markedly alter the periodic characteristics of and coupling between heart rate and ischemia. Ischemia remaining during beta 1-adrenergic blockade may have different spectral characteristics than that predominating during placebo administration. These differences may be manifestations of the heterogenous pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for ambulatory ischemia and may have therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".W": "The pivotal role of thrombosis in unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction has been established recently. To assess the value and safety of thrombolytic therapy compared to conventional antithrombotic therapy (aspirin) in arresting progression in this setting to recurrent ischemic end-points, 25 patients presenting with unstable angina and an electrocardiogram showing subendocardial ischemia were randomized to receive either aspirin 325 mg daily, or urokinase 3 x 10(6) U intravenously, over 30 minutes followed by heparin. Incidence of endpoints (intractable ischemia requiring mechanical intervention, new myocardial infarction or death) was determined over 7 days. Coronary arteriography was performed at 24 to 72 hours to determine extent of coronary artery disease and morphologic severity of the culprit lesion, graded by a semiquantitative scoring system ranging from 4+ (definite thrombosis) to 0 (chronic lesion). In the first 24 hours, 7 of 13 aspirin versus 1 of 12 urokinase patients exhibited ischemia progression (p less than 0.05). By 7 days, progression to a primary ischemic endpoint occurred in 8 of 13 aspirin patients (3 myocardial infarctions and 5 intractable ischemias) versus 3 of 12 urokinase patients (2 intractable ischemias and 1 death) (p = 0.18). The apparent benefit of urokinase followed by heparin compared to conventional aspirin therapy in arresting early progression of unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction was not associated with enhanced culprit lesion morphology (mean lesion severity score 2.7 +/- 1.5 vs 2.8 +/- 1.6 in aspirin-treated patients). Large scale, randomized trials to assess the clinical utility of urokinase for unstable angina are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred ninety-six consecutive patients admitted to the coronary care unit with suspected unstable angina were classified clinically as having either definite (113 patients) or suspected unstable angina (83 patients) within 24 hours of admission. Patients were followed prospectively to determine their outcome in the hospital and in the first 4 months after discharge. Three patients had a non-fatal myocardial infarction in the hospital and 2 died (1 fatal myocardial infarction, 1 death immediately after coronary bypass surgery). During follow-up (mean 4.2 +/- 2.3 months), 6 additional patients had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, 4 died and 22 were readmitted with definite unstable angina. The incidence of nonfatal infarction or death was significantly lower in patients with suspected unstable angina during both the primary hospital admission (0 of 83 vs 5 of 113, p less than 0.05) and after discharge from the hospital (1 of 83 vs 9 of 113, p less than 0.05), and fewer patients with suspected unstable angina were readmitted with a recurrence of definite unstable angina (1 of 83 vs 21 of 113, p less than 0.001). Thus, a simple clinical classification into definite or suspected unstable angina performed within 24 hours of admission to the coronary care unit identified a substantial group with a low short-term risk of adverse events.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the clinical value of positron emission tomography (PET) in the evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), PET perfusion and metabolic imaging using nitrogen-13 ammonia and fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) was performed before and 5 to 7 weeks after CABG in 22 patients with coronary artery disease. Postoperative improvement in hypoperfusion was observed more often in the metabolically active segments (62%) than in the inactive segments (27%) on the preoperative PET study (p less than 0.05). Similarly, the postoperative lessening of wall motion abnormality was observed more often in the metabolically active segments (78%) than in the inactive segments (22%) (p less than 0.001). Of 19 asynergic segments showing increased FDG uptake before operation, the postoperative PET revealed a decrease in FDG uptake in 13 (68%) and persistent uptake in 6 (32%). The improvement in asynergy was observed in all the segments that showed a postoperative decrease in FDG uptake, but in only 50% of those with persistent uptake (p less than 0.01). On the other hand, 4 of 5 segments showing a new FDG uptake after operation revealed further wall motion abnormality. Furthermore, the segments metabolically active before operation were more likely to have patent grafts (95%) than the metabolically inactive segments (70%) (p less than 0.05). Thus, preoperative metabolic imaging using PET appears to be useful for predicting the response to CABG. Improvement in metabolic derangement was associated with improvement in regional function after CABG.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of a 30 min/day, 3 day/week, 10-week strength training program in 9 stable, aerobically trained, male cardiac patients. The strength training program comprised lifting 80% of maximum voluntary contraction at 5 stations: quadriceps extension, bench press, standing biceps curl, hamstring curl and military press and performing 80% of the maximum number of sit-ups in 1 minute. Maximum voluntary contraction for each lift and body composition via body weight, hydrostatic weighing, skinfolds and girths were determined before and after training. The electrocardiogram was monitored during all maximum voluntary contraction lifts and heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were monitored during all activities. The only change in measures of body composition was an 11% increase in quadriceps girth (p less than 0.05). Maximum voluntary contraction increased 17, 12, 19, 53 and 46% for bench press, military press, standing biceps curl, quadriceps extension and hamstring curl, respectively (p less than 0.01), while the number of sit-ups performed in 1 minute increased 33% (p less than 0.05). No signs or symptoms of ischemia or abnormal heart rate or blood pressure responses were observed during the strength training program. Thus, resistive training at 80% of maximum voluntary contraction appears to be both safe and efficacious in stable, aerobically trained cardiac patients.\r"

Accordingly, this study is a segment-by-segment quantitative analysis of regional uptake and washout of thallium-201 after dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg) and symptom-limited exercise testing in 21 patients (ages 58 +/- 9.2 years) with chest pain studied 2.5 +/- 1.0 weeks apart. Thallium-201 activity in 9 myocardial segments was measured in initial and delayed anterior and 45 degree left anterior oblique views, producing 184 pairs of segments in the distribution of 63 coronary supply regions for direct comparison. The number of segments with normal thallium-201 uptake and the number of numerically significant defects were similar with exercise and dipyridamole (76 vs 73%, 24 vs 27%, respectively, difference not significant). A slightly higher proportion of redistribution defects was found after dipyridamole infusion compared to exercise (17 vs 10%, p less than 0.05). Agreement between 87% (165 of 189) of segment pairs was found when each was classified as either normal or abnormal. Although 24 of 189 segments were discordant, agreement was observed in 92% (61 of 63) of coronary supply regions determined to be normal (41 of 41) or abnormal (20 of 22). In 15 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, exercise and dipyridamole-thallium-201 scintigraphy detected 61% (16 of 26) vs 61% (16 of 26) of stenoses greater than 50% (difference not significant) and 100% (19 of 19) vs 100% (19 of 19) (difference not significant) normal vessels, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the impact of late reperfusion of an infarct-related coronary artery on left ventricular (LV) function in the month after myocardial infarction, findings from 368 patients in the Intravenous Streptokinase in Myocardial Infarction study are presented. All patients had a late peaking in the creatine kinase-MB serum time-activity curve, suggesting absence of early reperfusion. Contrast angiography was performed 1 month after the acute event. The infarct-related coronary artery was patent in 74 of 116 (64%) streptokinase-treated patients and 141 of 252 (56%) patients treated with anticoagulant therapy (placebo group). In all baseline variables, including the actually developed enzymatic and electrocardiographic infarct sizes, there were no differences between the patent- or occluded-artery groups. A patent infarct artery 1 month after infarction was associated with significantly better LV function regardless of the vessel involved and whether or not patients had been treated with streptokinase. Ejection fraction in patients with patent versus occluded artery was 56 +/- 13 versus 50 +/- 14 (p less than 0.0005). Most benefit was noted in patients in whom the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery was affected: ejection fraction was 52 +/- 14 versus 36 +/- 12% (p less than 0.0005). Our data confirm that restoration of adequate flow through an infarct-related coronary artery beyond the time window for actual salvage of ischemic myocardium has a definite beneficial effect on LV function.\r"

Seventy-nine known diabetics and 10 (3%) unknown diabetics--diagnosed before discharge by stable glycosylated hemoglobin greater than 6.9% and by oral glucose tolerance testing--were excluded. Thirty-three (10%) patients died. The mortality rate was higher in women, in patients with anterior AMI, in older patients (greater than 65 years) and in the presence of heart failure. It was highest in patients with cardiogenic shock (24/36 vs 9/294; p less than 0.0001). Admission plasma glucose was significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors (163 +/- 60 vs 114 +/- 36 mg/dl; p less than 0.0001). Mortality rate increased with increasing admission plasma glucose: 3% in normoglycemic patients (less than or equal to 120 mg/dl) versus 15% in patients with borderline plasma glucose (121 to 180 mg/dl) versus 43% in hyperglycemic patients (greater than 180 mg/dl) (p less than 0.0001). Multiple regression (stepwise) analysis identified cardiogenic shock, infarct site and age as the major determinants of mortality, while admission plasma glucose failed to reach full statistical significance (p = 0.067). Hyperglycemia was related to all 3 of these independent prognostic factors; when age and infarct site were accounted for, hyperglycemia was significantly associated with heart failure only and this association was characterized by a remarkable mortality rate. In nondiabetic patients with AMI, hyperglycemia is a correlate of heart failure and, therefore, an important factor of prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "A medical approach to treatment was adopted in 652 patients with documented myocardial ischemia at rest during both the acute and follow-up phases. No patient underwent coronary revascularization during hospitalization and only 86 patients (13%) underwent coronary bypass surgery within 8 months from discharge. During hospitalization 13 patients died. In the remaining group (639 patients), the likelihood of death in the 10-year period after discharge was 28% for all patients and 20% for cardiac causes only. A series of factors studied during the acute stage were assessed in an effort to predict long-term outcome. The following noninvasive characteristics, listed in decreasing order of statistical significance, were found to be significant univariate predictors of survival: abnormal basal electrocardiogram, duration of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, pattern of ST-T changes during episodes of ischemia at rest, age and systemic hypertension. The average annual mortality rate for patients with T-wave changes, ST-segment elevation and ST-segment depression was 0.9, 1.8 and 3%, respectively. The Cox survival analysis identified abnormal basal electrocardiogram, duration of coronary artery disease and pattern of ST-T changes as significant, independent predictors of death. When invasive characteristics were entered in the model, number of greater than or equal to 50% narrowed coronary arteries, left ventricular ejection fraction, abnormal basal electrocardiogram and smoking habit were found to be independent and additive prognostic variables. Thus, long-term prognosis of patients with ischemia at rest is related to the severity of anatomic impairment, independent of the pattern of ST-T changes observed during the acute phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiorespiratory endurance performance was assessed by determination of the ventilatory threshold. The mean value for ventilatory threshold was significantly lower (p less than 0.005) than the normal mean value and averaged 76 +/- 16%, 75 +/- 17% and 75 +/- 16% of the predicted normal value in children of the same sex and comparable age, weight and height, respectively. The ventricular rate at rest varied from 36 to 56 beats/min and increased to a mean value of 106 +/- 25 on exercise. When expressed as a percentage of the normal value, the heart rate was subnormal (below the 95% confidence limit) in all patients, throughout different exercise levels. For the same exercise intensity the oxygen uptake, expressed as ml/min/kg, was significantly lower (p less than 0.02) in patients than in normal individuals. This suggests an inadequate hemodynamic adjustment to the relative exercise bradycardia and a higher than normal anaerobic/aerobic energy supply. Exercise testing was found to be useful in the assessment of congenital AV block, because the resting heart rate did not permit prediction of the relative exercise bradycardia or the degree of exercise intolerance.\r"

The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1, 10 patients (17%) who developed ventricular arrhythmias during 26 of 92 (28%) ischemic attacks; and group 2, 50 patients who did not show this phenomenon. Daily ischemic attacks, total ischemic time and the proportion of symptomatic ischemic attacks were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) in group 1 versus group 2. In group 1 patients, ischemic attacks were found to have twice the duration in the presence of arrhythmias than in their absence (20.4 +/- 11.9 vs 9.1 +/- 8.4 minutes, p less than 0.01); arrhythmias were more common during symptomatic than during silent ischemic attacks (39 vs 13%, p less than 0.02). Arrhythmias occurred at the onset or peak of ST-segment depression (ischemia phase) in 6 cases (60%), during the resolution of ST-segment depression (recovery phase) in 2 cases (20%) and during both phases of ischemic attacks in the remaining 2 (20%). When compared to recovery phase arrhythmias, ischemia phase arrhythmias were characterized by a later onset time (173 +/- 144 vs 58 +/- 54 seconds, p less than 0.01) and a longer duration (105 +/- 107 vs 41 +/- 22 seconds, p less than 0.01). During the ischemia phase, 16 of 353 ventricular premature complexes initiated ventricular tachycardia, while during the recovery phase only 1 of 161 ventricular premature complexes resulted in ventricular tachycardia (4.5 vs 0.6%, p less than 0.02). Thus, ventricular arrhythmias may accompany spontaneous ischemic ST-segment depression, when the latter is recurrent, prolonged and symptomatic; arrhythmias are characterized by a greater frequency, duration and malignancy during the ischemia phase than during the recovery phase of ischemic attacks.\r"

  ".W": "Doppler echocardiographic measurements of blood flow velocity and acceleration in the ascending aorta have been shown to be useful descriptors of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. Few data exist, however, regarding the influence of loading conditions, particularly afterload, on these Doppler measurements in human subjects. Therefore, 14 normal volunteers (mean age 28 years) were studied using continuous wave Doppler echocardiography performed from the suprasternal notch both at baseline and during a controlled infusion of methoxamine. LV peak systolic (delta pk) and end-systolic (delta ES) wall stresses were calculated noninvasively using blood pressure and echocardiographic dimensions. Heart rate was kept constant by transesophageal atrial pacing. Methoxamine resulted in significant increases in mean systolic (163 +/- 8 vs 129 +/- 10 mm Hg) and diastolic (93 +/- 7 vs 71 +/- 12 mm Hg) blood pressure, as well as delta pk (277 +/- 25 vs 222 +/- 40 g/cm2 x 10(3] and delta ES (97 +/- 26 vs 77 +/- 19 g/cm2 x 10(3] (p less than or equal to 0.0004 for all). Conversely, peak velocity decreased from 0.91 +/- 0.18 m/s at baseline to 0.8 +/- 0.18 m/s (p less than or equal to 0.002) and peak acceleration decreased from 22 +/- 5 m/s2 at baseline to 19 +/- 5 m/s2 (p less than or equal to 0.006) during methoxamine infusion. Flow velocity integral and LV end-diastolic dimension remained unchanged. Thus, aortic flow velocity and peak acceleration are inversely related to afterload. This relation should be considered when using serial determinations of these Doppler parameters for patients in whom changing levels of afterload might occur.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred sixty-eight opiate addicts, whose hearts were submitted for necropsy study, were examined with prime focus on modes of death and types of cardiac abnormalities. Twenty various modes of death were identified: active infective endocarditis or its consequences in 67 (40%), drug overdose in 39 (24%), coronary artery disease in 14 (8%), pulmonary granulomatosis in 7 (4%) and 15 various diseases (7 cardiac and 8 noncardiac) in the remaining 41 (24%) patients. Of the 168 hearts examined, only 7 (4%) were normal. Although infective endocarditis (active, healed or both) was most common (80 [48%] patients), there was a broad range of other cardiac abnormalities present: cardiomegaly in 114 (68%) (including 22 patients without another cardiac abnormality), coronary artery disease in 35 (21%), acquired valvular heart disease in 16 (10%), myocardial heart disease in 14 (8%) and a congenital cardiac anomaly in 19 (11%). Of the 35 hearts with various coronary artery diseases, 28 had significant (greater than 75%) narrowing of the cross-sectional area of 1 or more of the 4 major (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex and right) epicardial coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaque. Of 112 coronary arteries in these 28 hearts, 52 (46%) were significantly narrowed (a mean of 1.9 of the 4 major coronary arteries/patient). In 27 of these 28 cases, each 5-mm segment of the 4 major coronary arteries was examined histologically. Of the 1,435 five-mm segments examined, 189 (13%) were narrowed 76 to 100% in cross-sectional area by plaque; 347 (24%), 51 to 75%; 336 (23%), 26 to 50%; and 563 segments (39%) were narrowed 0 to 25% in cross-sectional area by plaque. The percents of 5-mm segments narrowed 76 to 100% in cross-sectional area were greater in those patients with (128 of 793 [16%]) than without (61 of 642 [9%]) clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia (p = 0.001). In this study a very high frequency of cardiac abnormalities (161 [96%]) was found at necropsy and most deaths (97 [58%]) were related to cardiac disease. Although death was most often due to diseases whose association to opiate addiction is well recognized (such as infective endocarditis, drug overdose and pulmonary granulomatosis from the venous injection of talc), several other modes of death were present. Most prominent among these was coronary artery disease (14 patients [8%]).\r"

  ".W": "Frequently, indexes of systolic and diastolic left ventricular (LV) function obtained from radionuclide angiography are computed after the LV time-activity curve has been temporally smoothed. This smoothing process may introduce important systematic errors into the analysis. To assess this potential effect, high temporal resolution time-activity curves (20 ms/point) were obtained in 113 normal subjects, 175 patients with coronary artery disease and 171 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The curves were then subjected to 0-, 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-point temporal smoothing. In each group, increased smoothing progressively and consistently underestimated ejection fraction by up to 5% (p less than 0.001) and peak ejection rate by up to 14% (p less than 0.001). A greater effect on peak filling rate was observed: 5-point and 9-point smoothing reduced peak filling rate by 10% and 23% in normal subjects, 3% and 10% in patients with coronary artery disease and 7% and 15%, respectively, in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (all p less than 0.001). These errors were compounded further when the same data obtained at lower temporal resolution (40 ms/point) were analyzed: 5-point and 9-point smoothing resulted in underestimation of peak filling rate by 20% and 46% in normal subjects, 13% and 43% in coronary artery disease and 16% and 34% in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The underestimation was not uniform, and its magnitude varied considerably among individuals in each of the 3 groups. Thus, smoothing of LV time-activity curves may result in significant systematic errors in computation of indexes of LV systolic and diastolic function, especially in data with poor temporal resolution. These concepts apply to other imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging and cine-computed tomography, that assess LV function from the LV volume curve. Although ejection fraction is affected only mildly by these errors, both peak filling rate and peak ejection rate may be severely underestimated.\r"

However, clinical use of this technique has been limited by time-consuming manual ST-segment measurements and calculator-based linear regression analyses after testing. To assess the accuracy of on-line computerized measurement of ST-segment depression and recently implemented ST/HR slope algorithms, 50 patients exercised with a Marquette Electronics CASE 12 system and 50 patients exercised with a Quinton Q5000 system were evaluated. Computerized ST-segment measurements, to the nearest 10 microV, were compared with averaged manual measurements from the raw signal, to the nearest 25 microV, at peak exercise in leads II and CM5. The CASE 12 and Q5000 algorithms for selection of data and calculation of the maximal ST/HR slope were compared with the ST/HR slope calculated from end-stage data points according to a standard off-line procedure. Manual ST-segment measurements correlated highly with CASE 12 and Q5000 determinations (r = 0.996 to 0.998). The slopes of their regression lines approached unity (range 0.98 to 1.02), and the standard errors of the estimate ranged from 12 to 15 microV. Each on-line program selected data points and determined ST/HR slopes in complete accordance with standard calculations. It is concluded that computer-based measurement of the ST/HR slope can be performed with a high degree of accuracy.\r"

The dose-response effects of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg intravenous nicardipine were determined in 8 patients with angina. Dose-related decreases were seen in systemic mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.01) after administration of nicardipine. Cardiac pumping indexes were improved, as evident from linear increases in cardiac stroke volume (p less than 0.001), stroke length (p less than 0.01) and time-averaged mean velocity (p less than 0.01). The echo-Doppler device was also used to assess beta-blocking/nicardipine combination therapy in patients with angina. When nicardipine was given after the cardioselective beta blocker atenolol the reduction in heart rate and cardiac output after atenolol was reversed compared with a group that received atenolol followed by placebo. Cardiac performance improved and the 35% reduction in systemic vascular resistance was associated with markedly increased cardiac index (p less than 0.01), augmentation of time-averaged mean velocity (p less than 0.01) and cardiac stroke length (p less than 0.05). These data are consistent with previous invasive studies of nicardipine, either alone or when combined with beta blockade in coronary disease. The data also suggest that nicardipine/beta-blocking combination is safe in patients with coronary heart disease and that the echo-Doppler method of cardiovascular monitoring will prove useful in human pharmacodynamic studies.\r"

  ".W": "Nicardipine, a calcium antagonist of the 1:4 dihydropyridine type, has been used to treat angina and hypertension and is currently being examined as an agent for treating ischemia of cerebral and myocardial tissue. Nicardipine shows high affinity for the dihydropyridine binding site (pKi = 9.7) and inhibits the L-type calcium ion channel as demonstrated by its ability to decrease the calcium ion-dependent action potential dose-dependently in ventricular papillary muscle (pIC50 = 7.15). Nicardipine shows greater potency in inhibiting the response of vascular smooth muscle (pIC50 = 8.20) than that of cardiac muscle (pIC50 = 7.15). The nicardipine selectivity for vascular smooth muscle is greater than that shown by other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine and accounts for the efficacy of nicardipine in the treatment of angina and hypertension. Various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the beneficial action of nicardipine in treating animal models of cerebral ischemia and myocardial infarction. For example, it has been suggested that (1) nicardipine has a specific membrane-stabilizing effect on cell membranes, (2) the compound blocks certain sodium channels, (3) it may become concentrated in ischemic cells, or (4) it may stimulate calcium ion efflux from mitochondria, and these actions may account for the inhibition by nicardipine of veratrine-induced contraction of myocytes. In this study, some of these effects of nicardipine were examined. However, the suggestion that nicardipine concentrates in ischemic cells owing to the tertiary amine structure could not be conclusively demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Systemic vascular resistance decreased (from 1,183 +/- 70 to 733 +/- 33 dynes s cm-5) as did coronary resistance (from 1.47 +/- 0.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm Hg/ml/min; p less than 0.001). Other hemodynamic parameters such as left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, stroke volume and work, aortic blood flow and acceleration, ejection and external power, myocardial oxygen consumption and time constant for left ventricular isovolumic relaxation also were evaluated. To distinguish between direct myocardial effects of nicardipine and peripheral effects, 15 patients were given intracoronary nicardipine (0.1 or 0.2 mg) during cardiac catheterization. Nicardipine produced slight depression of left ventricular contractile function and impairment of left ventricular relaxation; but these changes were mild and transient compared with the marked and sustained increase in coronary blood flow that persisted 7 minutes after administration. Thus, nicardipine is a relatively selective vasodilator with minimal direct myocardial depressant activity n humans.\r"

Overall, fatness differences between husbands and wives diminish with increased education, and beyond 13 y of education husbands often exceed the subcutaneous fat thickness of their wives. When the education of one spouse is held constant at 9-12 y, women who marry up to men of greater education are systematically leaner and women who mary down are both fatter and heavier. These findings in spouse pairs sharing a common family income suggest that assortative mating with respect to educational level accounts for much of the socioeconomic effect in fatness including the fatness differences between women who marry down and those who marry up. These data also demonstrate that women are not fatter than men at all socioeconomic levels.\r"

Mild acidosis developed during the protein diet as well as greater excretions of urinary ammonium and urea N, a greater degree of ketosis, and significantly better N balance (-42.7 vs -80.4 g, p less than 0.05) than during the glucose diet. The subsequent fast was associated with greater negative N balance after protein (-129 vs 83 g), mainly as urea N, but despite similar ketosis there was a greater acidosis after glucose and greater ammonium N excretion and cumulative K losses. These data support the concept of a labile N pool, depleted during a glucose diet and resulting in a decreased loss with the subsequent fast. We suggest a role for K depletion in augmenting fasting ammonium excretion.\r"

These mothers, who were exclusively breast-feeding their infants, collected fore- and hindmilk samples at every feeding over a 24-h period. Samples were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Mean (+/- SD) cholesterol concentrations were 0.41 +/- 0.094, 0.46 +/- 0.094, and 0.49 +/- 0.10 mmol/L, respectively. The following cholesterol precursors were identified: squalene, lanosterol, dimethylsterol, delta 8.24-methostenol, lathosterol, and desmosterol. Mean concentrations were 0.04 +/- 0.11, 0.35 +/- 0.13, and 0.29 +/- 0.012 mmol/L for desmosterol, 0.0094 +/- 0.0027, 0.012 +/- 0.0039, and 0.011 +/- 0.0039 mmol/L for squalene, and from 0.0011 to 0.0027 mmol/L for all the other precursors. The precursors' equally low concentrations, except for desmosterol and squalene, and the significant correlations with each other suggest that the mammary gland synthesizes cholesterol from lanosterol by preserving the side-chain double bond and that the rate-limiting step may be the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol.\r"

Eleven normal subjects consumed formula diets containing 20% of calories as soy protein or casein, 27% as fat, and 53% as carbohydrate: the average cholesterol intake was 500 mg/d. After an initial decrease in plasma cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on both diets, the concentration of LDL-C stabilized during the soy-protein diet at a 16% lower level than on the casein diet (p less than 0.02) whereas the concentration of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was 16% higher (p less than 0.01). In a similar earlier study with a cholesterol intake of less than 100 mg/d, casein and soy protein had indistinguishable effects on lipoprotein levels. Our two studies together suggest that the level of cholesterol intake may determine whether plant and animal dietary proteins have similar or different effects on plasma LDL and HDL concentrations.\r"

Compared with healthy control subjects, plasma lipids in patients with MS contained less sphingomyelin but more phosphatidylserine and the cholesterol-phospholipid ratio was 42% higher in the plasma from MS patients (p less than 0.01). In erythrocytes from MS patients, phosphatidylinositol was lower and erythrocyte cholesterol per milligram protein was significantly lower than concentrations in healthy control subjects (p less than 0.01). Among the long-chain fatty acids, the omega-3 fatty acids were lower in plasma from MS patients and linoleic acid was lower in erythrocyte ghosts from MS patients (p less than 0.01). We conclude that altered levels of cholesterol in plasma and erythrocytes from MS patients may contribute to increased erythrocyte-membrane Zn in MS patients. It cannot be stated with certainty whether the altered fatty acid profiles in MS patients were a function of the disease or of altered fatty acid intake.\r"

Ketomethylvalerate (KMV) was significantly higher in patients receiving BCKA supplements, presumably reflecting accumulation of the R(-) isomer. Mean levels of all three BCKAs were not significantly different from normal. However, multiple-regression analysis showed that plasma ketoisocaproate was strongly correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR), negatively correlated with serum triglyceride concentration, and positively correlated with protein intake. KMV concentration was also correlated positively with GFR, negatively with triglyceridemia, and positively with serum total carbon dioxide. Ketoisovalerate concentration did not vary with GFR and was not predictable from the regressors used. Single oral doses of a mixture containing all three BCKAs led to the same areas under the three plasma concentration curves in patients with CRF as in normal subjects, indicating that absorption of all three BCKAs after oral administration in patients with CRF is unimpaired.\r"

The non-Fe-group mean, adjusted serum Zn concentrations showed no change, but the serum Fe decreased to 28% below prestudy concentrations at 38 wk. In contrast, the Fe-supplementation group showed a progressive increase in Fe concentrations to a maximum of 38% above prestudy concentrations at 4 wk postpartum and a 35% decrease from prestudy Zn concentrations during the third trimester.

By use of logistic regression models, children born into households with a college-educated head were shown to be more likely to be breast-fed than were other children; breast-feeding was also positively associated with birth weight. Infants in households for which the preferred interview language was Spanish were more likely to be breast-fed than were infants living in households for which the interview was conducted in English. Analysis of the factors influencing the distribution of weaning times among infants was less definitive because reported weaning times are heaped on multiples of 3 mo. The gathering of current-status, or status quo, information on infant feeding is urged for data collection in future studies.\r"

Epithelial cells in fibrocystic disease and fibroadenomas contained a mean of 2.65-6.8 small uniform AgNORs per cell, whereas malignant cells contained 4.6-26.9 frequently highly irregular AgNORs. In benign tissue, Ki67 scores ranged from 0 to 4%; in malignant tumors, Ki67 scores ranged from 3.0 to 98%. The correlation between AgNOR counts and Ki67 scores was highly significant (P less than 0.001). The authors concluded that AgNOR counts performed on routine formalin-fixed paraffin sections furnish significant kinetic information. Furthermore, the difference in AgNOR counts between benign and malignant tumors is such that they may be of diagnostic value.\r"

Therefore, the decreased growth rate and decreased area of outgrowth may be caused by a defective migration potential rather than an impaired mitotic activity. The latter seems to be normal, as demonstrated by the histomorphometry, which indicates the in vivo situation. Decreased migration potential of epidermal cells could explain the clinically observed protracted epithelialization of decubitus ulcers.\r"

  ".U": "90023347\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are often seen in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCCs). Their functional role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer is unknown. The authors studied TILs in 27 patients with NSCC and determined the following: (1) the immunologic phenotype as defined by monoclonal antibodies against various surface markers, (2) activation state as indicated by interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor expression and the kinetics of proliferation response to IL-2, and (3) the ability to develop lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) type cytotoxicity against both natural killer (NK)-resistant tumor cell targets (M14) and fresh autologous tumor cells. The authors' results show TILs from NSCCs to be a heterogeneous population composed of T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, and NK cells in frequencies similar to those found in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). TILs demonstrated increased IL-2 receptor expression and a more rapid proliferative response to IL-2 than PBLs, implying activation of TILs by the tumor milieu. Finally, TILs generated cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive (K562) and NK-resistant (M14) cell line targets consistently after in vitro treatment with IL-2 but were less consistent in their ability to lyse fresh autologous tumor cells and less effective than PBL LAK cells in lysing all targets. Comparison with LAK cells generated from normal volunteers suggests that decreased killing of autologous tumor cells only partially results from an inherent resistance to lysis by fresh NSCC targets. It appears, therefore, that tumor cells taken from NSCCs are not readily killed by the immune cells that infiltrate the tumor stroma and that this failure does not result from nonspecific immune deficiency in TILs.\r"

Using the standard deviation of log-transformed nuclear areas as the measure of lymphoid cell homogeneity, diffuse small cell lymphomas were found to be significantly more homogeneous than diffuse large cell lymphomas or benign lymphoid proliferations, but there was no significant difference in the homogeneity of the latter two groups. Two of four large cell lymphomas showed a bimodal distribution of nuclear areas. Methodologic issues--including the random selection of cells, the number of cells that should be counted in each case, the significance of microscopic field-to-field variation in this setting, and the significance of drift in observations during the examination of individual cases--are discussed.\r"

The assays were performed with an Ortho ELT-800 automated analyzer. The estimates of within-subject biologic variation were similar to published data on young subjects, indicating that this aspect of homeostasis is not compromised in the elderly. The data were used to derive objective analytic goals; goals were surpassed except for assays of erythrocytes, hematocrit, and the derived MCV, MCH, and MCHC. The changes required for serial results to be significantly different were determined and found to be generally valid because most quantities have no heterogeneity of within-subject variation. All quantities had significant individuality; in consequence, conventional population-based reference values are of limited utility, and screening using reference limits will not detect latent or early disease in many subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Designated or directed blood transfusion (DD) is a controversial practice; its merits are currently debated on the basis of implications for the national blood supply and on the \"safety\" of directed blood compared with homologous blood. An equally compelling issue for the merits of DD is whether this practice results in its putative effect: to avoid volunteer homologous blood exposure. To study this, the authors reviewed 112 consecutive patients (73 orthopedic) who predeposited autologous blood for elective surgery. This group was compared with 17 patients (all orthopedic) who predeposited autologous blood and also requested storage of designated blood. Seven of 17 patients with DD subsequently received homologous blood, compared with 11 of 112 patients without designated blood (NDD, P less than 0.01) and 3 of 35 NDD orthopedic patients asked to predonate three or more units of blood, P = 0.015. DD and NDD patients were no different when analyzed for age, sex, or units blood stored; admission, nadir, or discharge hematocrit; autologous blood transfused; days in hospital; or surgical blood loss. The authors conclude that patient requests for DD are unjustified for elective surgical patients who are eligible to donate autologous blood because DD as practiced in this setting does not avoid subsequent homologous blood exposure. Maximizing autologous blood procurement is the preferred alternative for avoiding homologous blood transfusion.\r"

Cellular interaction to extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesive proteins is mediated by integrins. Certain tumor cells are known to interact with ECM and blood platelets in the process of metastasis. However, it is not known if tumor cells, compared with their normal counterparts, acquire IIb-IIIa-like receptors to help them in their metastatic spread. In this study, monoclonal antibodies directed against the IIb-IIIa platelet glycoprotein complex were used on frozen biopsies of normal and various tumor tissues to detect the presence of these integrins. These studies demonstrate the presence of IIb-IIIa-like glycoproteins on the cells of metastatic malignant melanoma but not on benign melanocytes and rarely on other tumors. The presence of integrins on melanomas may help explain their propensity for frequent metastasis.\r"

Focal luteinization, a thickened tunica albuginea, and multiple cystic follicles are histologic features that have been associated with stromal hyperplasia in virilized women. This report describes the case of a 57-year-old woman who presented with a four-year history of virilization. The testosterone level was 13.8 nmol/L (3,980 ng/L). At laparotomy, the ovaries were found to be enlarged, each measuring 4 cm in maximum dimension. Salient histologic findings included diffuse stromal hyperplasia interspersed with a marked increase in the number of corpora atretica. Focal luteinization, including in some corpora atretica, was seen. Electron microscopic study demonstrated cells with increased smooth endoplasmic reticulin and mitochondria with tubular cristae as well as other features consistent with theca cells; Reinke crystals were not seen. The testosterone level normalized after removal of the ovaries, and the signs of virilism gradually abated. These results are compatible with an abnormal stimulation of the ovaries as evidenced by an increased though abortive follicular development, stromal hyperplasia, and focal luteinization.\r"

Demographic data reflect an increase in the proportion of foreign medical graduates (from 24.8% in 1983 to 32.8% in 1988) in U.S. training programs with concomitant decrease in proportion of U.S. medical graduates (from 74.8% to 61.5%, respectively). Canadian residents comprise approximately 5% of the test population. Response surveys from residents and program directors indicate a high degree of satisfaction with the PRISE. In 1988 40.6% of all program directors thought that the PRISE satisfied their objectives very well, and 56% thought that objectives were met satisfactorily. For residents the corresponding rates were 21.2% and 70.7%. Trends in resident group performance in each subspecialty area of pathology, and the implications for residency training are discussed.\r"

Key features are problem-based small group tutorials that emphasize active learning, with increased independent study time and a decreased number of lectures. Tutors serve as guides to their students and are not necessarily experts in the discipline of the cases studied. Learning skills are taught, including information acquisition and criticism and computer literacy. Knowledge is integrated from the beginning by interdisciplinary basic science courses, by earlier introduction of the clinical sciences, and by juxtaposition of the scientific and humanistic aspects of medicine. Preventive medicine, health maintenance, and ambulatory care are given more attention. The students are organized into societies that provide vertical integration and promote cooperation among students and closer contact with faculty. Pathology has proved to be a popular and key bridge in the new curriculum. The success of the early efforts at Harvard and several pioneering medical schools should encourage others to move toward more problem-solving, student-centered, integrative medical education.\r"

Negative attitudes on the part of clinicians were seen as the primary factor that serves to inhibit enthusiasm for the autopsy on the part of pathology house staff. Lack of prompt and appropriate communication with the attending physician and uneven quality of prosectors are seen as major inhibitors to successful autopsy services. Chairmen of departments of pathology support an approximate doubling of the autopsy rate in their institutions (from 30% to 64%), although 42.5% of chairmen had not discussed their wishes concerning autopsy with the next of kin and only 42% regularly attend gross conference. These perceptions are remarkably similar to those provided by chairmen of departments of medicine and surgery as a part of a previous survey. On the basis of these inputs, several recommendations designed to improve the local emphasis on the autopsy service are provided.\r"

The diagram can be used to assess which applications provide the most strategic leverage in a hospital by adding value to the laboratory information product. One of the most important goals for pathologists in the future will be to assist clinicians in caring for patients in the most efficient and effective manner possible. A state-of-the-art LIS with direct support by a cadre of highly trained personnel is necessary to pursue this goal.\r"

Standard diagnostic methods do not permit identification of the infected newborns. To assess diagnostic methods and document the natural history of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus infection, 20 children born to human immunodeficiency virus-infected women were followed prospectively for 18 months by measuring antibody titer, Western blot profiles, and antigenemia, and the results were compared with clinical outcome. Endogenous synthesis of anti-human immunodeficiency virus IgG was demonstrated in 6 of the 8 infected children. Four children synthesized IgM against human immunodeficiency virus. Five had demonstrable p24 antigenemia. No significant differences between infected and noninfected children were noted at birth except drug withdrawal, which occurred more frequently in noninfected infants. The incidence of adenopathy, hepatomegaly, and neurologic and immunologic abnormalities in the infected children were compared with noninfected children. The distinguishing illnesses were the opportunistic infections, lobar pneumonia, and failure to thrive. Seven of the 8 infected children had human immunodeficiency virus-mediated disease by 1 year of age (Centers for Disease Control [Atlanta, Ga] P2 classification), and four had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Centers for Disease Control P2D). These studies offer an approach to diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus infection in infants and document the natural history and possible outcomes of infected children.\r"

A self-administered questionnaire was used to survey 196 adolescent females regarding communication with their parents about sexual issues and their reaction to proposed parental notification of the dispensing of prescription contraception. Parents of 80% of the subjects who were sexually experienced were aware of this activity. Parents of 80% of those subjects who had used contraception were aware of this use; 59% of these subjects informed their parents before their family planning visit. The majority of female adolescents (57%) were unwilling to communicate with their parents about sexual issues; 64% felt they should be able to receive prescription contraception without parental knowledge. Communication regarding sexual issues was related to lifetime contraceptive use. Eighteen percent of the sexually experienced subjects would not allow their parents to be notified of their family planning visit; 86% would use less effective contraception if family planning services were not sought. Our findings suggest that a parental notification policy will not compel all adolescents to inform parents about their contraceptive use; most adolescents will resort to less effective contraceptive methods.\r"

Requests for assistance from nonphysician members of a multidisciplinary diabetes team were minimal. After introduction of the structured visit encounter form, care behaviors did not improve. New training approaches to prepare general pediatric residents to provide excellent diabetes care are needed.\r"

Reye's syndrome was defined as certain, probable, unlikely, or excluded according to clinical, biological, and histologic criteria agreed on a priori by a panel of experts. Patient charts were reviewed blindly by three clinicians. Assessments were similar in 42 cases (86%) (weighted K = 0.78 to 0.85, which suggested substantial agreement); for the remainder, agreement was reached after discussion. Reye's syndrome was considered certain in 1 case (2%), probable in 11 (22%), unlikely in 21 (43%), and excluded in 15 (31%). Four children in the study group did not undergo biopsy or autopsy; in three of these, Reye's syndrome was unlikely according to clinical and biological criteria, and in one, the diagnosis was unclassifiable. The incidence of certain or probable Reye's syndrome was low in our institution during the study period. Our results suggest that the apparent disappearance of Reye's syndrome should be reassessed.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six very-low-birth-weight preterm infants with and without intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) were followed up prospectively from birth to school age to determine the relationship between ICH and subsequent neurologic and cognitive outcomes. All children had sequential cranial ultrasound examinations at birth and neurologic assessments at 3-month intervals during the first year, at 1 year of age, and at 5 to 6 years; psychometric assessments were done at 5 to 6 years. Seventeen children had no ICH, 3 had grade 1 ICH, 1 had grade 3 ICH, and 5 had grade 4 ICH. The 1-year Amiel-Tison neurologic assessment in 25 infants demonstrated that 14 were normal, 3 were suspect, and 8 were abnormal. By 5 to 6 years of age, 5 of 8 children neurologically abnormal at 1 year remained abnormal, 2 of 3 children neurologically suspect at 1 year remained suspect; while 9 of 15 children neurologically normal at 1 year remained normal, the remaining 6 had become suspect. The predominant neurologic abnormality at 5 to 6 years was subtle neurologic dysfunctioning. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at 5 to 6 years revealed a mean group IQ score of 92.1. The Beery Visual Motor Integration Test results demonstrated that 18 of 26 children had mild to severe visual motor perceptual difficulties. Severe ICH (grades 3 and 4) correlated with abnormal neurologic performances at 1 and 5 to 6 years. Mild ICH (grade 1) and no ICH did not correlate with any one of the 1-year neurologic classifications. The 1-year status correlated with the 5- to 6-year neurologic outcome best for children who were either neurologically suspect or abnormal at age 1 year. The 1-year neurologic score did not correlate with 5- to 6-year IQ and Beery Visual Motor Integration Test scores.\r"

Examination at birth, at hospital discharge (study entry), at 4 and 16 weeks after hospitalization, and at 52 weeks of age revealed no intergroup differences in body weight, length, and head circumference. Hypophosphatemia (plasma phosphorus concentration less than or equal to 1.45 mmol/L) developed in 6 infants fed human milk (5 infants at 4 weeks and 1 infant at 16 weeks of study). Mean vitamin D intakes, but not calcium and phosphorus intakes, were significantly lower during hospitalization in human milk-fed infants with hypophosphatemia (44 [25, SD] IU/d) compared with those without hypophosphatemia (322 [180] IU/d). These data indicate that human milk-fed, low-birth-weight infants are at risk for hypophosphatemia following initial hospital discharge. Plasma calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations at hospital discharge may not predict the infants at risk. Vitamin D supplementation early in the infants' hospital course may prevent hypophosphatemia.\r"

The mothers had mild respiratory disease. All three newborns presented with life-threatening coughing and choking spells without a characteristic inspiratory whoop. Two neonates had apnea, bradycardia, cyanosis, and unresponsiveness, but were without the initial lymphocytosis that is distinctive of pertussis. These two neonates had a clinical course that was consistent with the historic \"100-day-cough.\" They required prolonged ventilatory support and hospitalization at a high cost. The other neonate had a terminal pulmonary hemorrhage. Strategies for the early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this potentially lethal disease in neonates are discussed.\r"

Moreover, previous investigations of short-term memory in long-term marijuana smokers involved adults only. We evaluated the auditory/verbal and visual/spatial memory of 10 cannabis-dependent adolescents and compared the results with performance of 17 subjects in two control groups. The control groups included 8 adolescent drug abusers who had not been long-term users of cannabis and another 9 adolescents who had never abused any drug. All three groups were matched on age, IQ, and absence of previous learning disabilities. Adolescents with a history of frequent alcohol or phencyclidine abuse were excluded from entering the study. A battery of seven neuropsychological tests was administered initially to all subjects and a parallel test battery was administered 6 weeks thereafter. Significant differences between the cannabis-dependent group and the two control groups were obtained initially on the Benton Visual Retention Test (F[2,24] = 6.07) and the Wechsler Memory Scale Prose Passages (F[2,23] = 7.04). After 6 weeks of supervised abstention from intoxicants, subjects in the cannabis-dependent group showed some significant improvement on the Wechsler Memory Prose Passages score and on the Benton Visual Retention Test; however, the improvement failed to achieve statistical significance. We concluded that cannabis-dependent adolescents have selective short-term memory deficits that continue for at least 6 weeks after the last use of marijuana.\r"

Transfusion/blood product-related human immunodeficiency virus acquisitions (especially in males with hemophilia) represented 11% of adolescent cases from NYC (1% of NYC adults) and 22% of adolescent cases in the United States (US) outside of NYC (4% of adults in the US). Intravenous drug use was more frequently reported among adolescents with AIDS from NYC (23%) than among adolescents outside NYC (14%). In females, heterosexual transmission accounts for about half of all adolescent AIDS cases and 29% of all adult cases.

The changes in scores on a standardized achievement test and in rates of absence and tardiness before and after the implementation of the School Breakfast Program for children participating in the program were compared with those of children who also qualified but did not participate. Controlling for other factors, participation in the School Breakfast Program contributed positively to the 1987 Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills battery total scale score and negatively to 1987 tardiness and absence rates. These findings suggest that participation in the School Breakfast Program is associated with significant improvements in academic functioning among low-income elementary school children.\r"

Overall densitometric and histomorphometric findings indicate a derangement of trabecular bone in both alcoholic and hemochromatotic cirrhosis, whereas cortical osteoporosis seems limited to hemochromatotic patients.\r"
