Oral ciprofloxacin therapy did not promote colonization of the oropharynx by gram-negative bacilli.\r"

  ".W": "Well-defined clusters of plasmacytoid T cells were identified in two cases of lymphoid hyperplasia of the skin. With the use of paraffin-embedded and frozen sections and 46 different antibodies, the antigenic profile of plasmacytoid T cells was obtained. Corresponding to plasmacytoid T cells in reactive and neoplastic lymph node conditions, plasmacytoid T cells of the skin were devoid of most T-cell-restricted differentiation antigens CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD8 while expressing monocyte/macrophage-related antigens recognized by Ki-M6 and Ki-M7. In addition, plasmacytoid T cells were positive for CD4, CD45, HLA class II antigens (HLA-DR, Leu-10, MB3, LN2, LN3) and the transferrin receptor. Furthermore, they reacted with anti-Leu-8, MB1, Ki-B3 (CD45R), and MT1. Thus plasma-cytoid T cells are considered to be mononuclear cells with monocyte/macrophage differentiation rather than T lymphocytes. In addition, our findings substantiate the concept that plasmacytoid T cells may function as a hitherto unrecognized subgroup of antigen-presenting cells in the skin.\r"

We found a significantly increased maternal weight gain and newborn birth weight in patients with PUPPP, compared with age and parity-matched controls. The average weight gain during pregnancy was 18.1 +/- 0.9 (SEM) kg for the patients with PUPPP (excluding twin gestations) and 14.6 +/- 1.0 kg for the controls. The mean newborn birth weight was 3.6 +/- 0.09 kg for the PUPPP group and 3.3 +/- 0.08 kg for the control group. There were three twin pregnancies (10%), compared with the twin gestation rate at our institution of 1.6%. Therefore, based on our findings of an increased maternal weight gain and neonatal birth weight, an increased twin rate, and an abdominal eruption that occurs in primigravidas in their third trimester of pregnancy, we suggest that abdominal distention or a reaction to it may play a role in the development of PUPPP.\r"

The patient failed to respond to a 2-week course of intravenous vidarabine. However, rapid improvement in the orofacial lesion occurred with intravenous foscarnet. Most HSV isolates that are resistant to acyclovir are spontaneous mutants partially or completely lacking in thymidine kinase. Because foscarnet is a direct inhibitor of HSV DNA polymerase, this compound is expected to have efficacy against acyclovir-resistant strains. This report documents successful treatment of clinically significant HSV with intravenous administration of foscarnet, suggesting that further study is indicated.\r"

For comparative purposes, we measured lung function and bronchial reactivity in a reference group of 37 children who had asthma of the same clinical severity and who were taking the same medication. In comparison with this reference group the index subjects showed a high degree of bronchial reactivity, incomplete recovery of function after bronchodilation, and appreciably reduced perception of severe lung function impairment.

  ".W": "In 1973 a survey was conducted among 12 year old children living in a defined area of South Wales. In 1988 the survey was repeated in the same area, again among 12 year old children. Questionnaires were completed for all 965 children in the population sample; peak expiratory flow rates were performed on them all, and repeated (except for five children) after an exercise provocation test. The prevalence of a history of wheeze at any time had increased from 17% to 22%, while that of a history of asthma at any time had increased from 6% to 12%. Current asthma had increased from 4% to 9%, but wheezing in the past year not attributed to asthma had remained at 6%. The exercise provocation tests suggested that both mild and severe asthma had become more common. Increases had also occurred in the frequencies of a history of eczema (from 5% to 16%) and of hay fever (from 9% to 15%). It seems that the prevalence of asthma has risen, and that this cannot be wholly explained by a greater readiness to diagnose the disease.\r"

Significant differences remained after standardising for maternal age and social class. The highest overall mortality was in infants of mothers born in Pakistan (standardised mortality ratio 237), followed by infants of mothers born in India (standardised mortality ratio 134), East Africa (standardised mortality ratio 126), and Bangladesh (standardised mortality ratio 118). Caribbean and West African mothers showed an overall deficit. Mortality was inversely related to social class in all groups except the Afro-Caribbean. Infants of mothers born in Pakistan had the highest mortality in every social class except I, and for most anomalies investigated. Their ratios were particularly high for limb and musculoskeletal anomalies (standardised mortality ratio 362), genitourinary anomalies (standardised mortality ratio 268), and central nervous system anomalies (standardised mortality ratio 239). Our findings highlight the need for further research to identify the causes underlying these differences.\r"

Paired capillary blood samples were collected and measured on the haemoglobinometer and on a Coulter counter model S. Measurements made from bottle collected capillary samples were more precise than those made from single drops of blood. After compensation for a fixed bias the haemoglobinometer had a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.94 when used to detect anaemia. Careful attention must be paid to the method of blood collection. We suggest that cuvettes are filled from bottle collected capillary samples rather than single blood droplets taken direct from the finger. The haemoglobinometer was reliable, simple to use with the minimum of training, and proved to be suitable for use in a community child health clinic.\r"

  ".W": "In a community based study, height and weight increments of 441 Nepali children aged 0-6 years were measured before harvest and six months later and compared with centile standards derived from American children. Low mean growth velocities for height were found only in children under 2 years of age, and for weight during the first 18 months. The mean height for age standard deviation score for the 12-23 months age group was already -2.8 at first measurement. The effect of the initial thinness of the child on subsequent height and weight velocity was reciprocal: thin children seemed to catch up weight at the expense of height. These results suggest that stunting is caused largely by a reduced growth velocity during the nutrition dependent infantile phase of growth, with some additional impairment and delay in onset of the early childhood phase of growth hormone dependent growth, especially in thin children. Nutritional interventions after the second year of life are unlikely to alter the prevalence of linear growth retardation in poor communities. Growth velocity may be more useful than static anthropometry to assess the impact of such interventions.\r"

Two equations were developed for increasing the accuracy of the evaluation of growth. One defines parent specific mean height standard deviation score, and the other includes the parents' heights and the child's height at the age of 1.0 year and defines expected standard deviation score for height. These equations are easy to use if they are converted to nomograms.\r"

Two had primary pulmonary hypertension, two cystic fibrosis, and one had Eisenmenger's syndrome. All five children are alive and well five to 17 months after operation and have returned to activities normal for their age. Three of the five patients had episodes of infection after operation. These were staphylococcal pneumonia, herpes simplex pneumonitis and, in one of the patients with cystic fibrosis, persistent purulent sputum. The mean number of episodes of rejection per child was 2.7 per half year. Heart-lung transplantation is a practical treatment for children in these disease groups with terminal respiratory failure.\r"

In acute interstitial pneumonitis (n = 22, 26 specimens from bronchoalveolar lavages) the microbiological yield was 73%, Pneumocystis carinii being the commonest infective agent (n = 14). P carinii pneumonia was found only in children with deficient antigen induced lymphocyte proliferative responses who had not been treated with long term prophylactic co-trimoxazole. In contrast, in 13 children with chronic interstitial pneumonitis that was consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage on 17 occasions, there were two isolates of cytomegalovirus and one of adenovirus, but P carinii was not found. Ten of the 13 children had normal antigen induced lymphocyte proliferative responses. Useful cytological data were also gleaned from bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Lymphocytosis was significantly higher in pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia (36(SD 11)%) than in P carinii pneumonia (24(19)%) whereas the percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was significantly lower (3(2)% compared with 12(13)%). Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is safe even in young infants and should reduce the necessity for open lung biopsy in the management of HIV infected children with interstitial pneumonitis.\r"

Histological examination of eight of the 17 biopsies taken over a period of 12 years showed evidence of enteropathy, and accounted for one in 13 (8%) children with cystic fibrosis under 3 years of age attending our clinic. Seven responded to a cows' milk free diet; the diarrhoea stopped and weight gain increased. One of these responded only when gluten was also excluded from his diet. The eighth child remained on a normal diet and his symptoms did not improve. The enteropathy had resolved in all five patients who had further biopsies taken while receiving treatment, and from 15 months to 3 years of age all the children tolerated a normal diet and continued to thrive. Cows' milk sensitive enteropathy is an important cause of failure to thrive in children with cystic fibrosis. Small intestinal biopsy is an important investigation in younger children who fail to thrive and have diarrhoea despite adequate treatment.\r"

When challenged six infants (group 1) developed clinical symptoms and five did not (group 2). In group 1 the lesions developed in both the jejunal mucosa (four infants at 24 hours and one at three days), and the rectal mucosa, and the injury was associated with depletion of alkaline phosphatase activity. Infants in group 2 were normal. It seems that rectal injury that develops as a direct consequence of oral challenge with the protein in reactive infants may be used as one of the measurements to confirm the diagnosis of cows' milk protein sensitive enteropathy. Moreover, ingestion of such food proteins may injure the distal colonic mucosa without affecting the proximal small gut in some infants.\r"

TNF-alpha was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of 15 of 18 patients with bacterial meningitis. In 11 patients who had cerebrospinal fluid positive for TNF-alpha it was detected in only one serum (in low concentration). There was no significant correlation between the concentration of TNF-alpha in cerebrospinal fluid and the patient's age, duration of illness and fever, body temperature, and serum C reactive protein. However, cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations of greater than or equal to 2 g/l and leucocyte values of greater than or equal to 2.5 X 10(9)/l were more often associated with high TNF-alpha concentrations (greater than or equal to 500 pg/ml). In contrast with bacterial meningitis, none of the 31 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with viral meningitis was positive for TNF-alpha. Thus this investigation supports the conclusion, drawn from animal studies on TNF-alpha in the cerebrospinal fluid, that the presence of TNF-alpha is indicative of bacterial meningitis. Absence of TNF-alpha cerebrospinal fluid, however, was found here not to exclude a bacterial aetiology of the infection.\r"

Recent audiograms showed a hearing loss that was usually uniform across all frequencies, equal in both ears and severe, averaging 93 dB across the range 250-4000 Hz. Despite the early diagnosis of congenital rubella and the known risk of deafness, only eight of 57 infants had been tested for auditory evoked responses in the first 6 months of life; all eight had severe hearing loss. Evidence of progressive hearing loss was found in only one of the 57 children. Definitive hearing tests (as distinct from screening tests) were frequently delayed until after the first birthday. Newborn babies identified as being at high risk of congenital deafness should have a full audiological assessment in early infancy.\r"

Children of the cohort were similar in height and forced vital capacity to the reference group, but had significantly reduced forced expiratory volume in 0.75 second and expiratory flow indices. Although neonatal respiratory illness was associated with reduced airway function, we were unable to confirm that this was a consequence of oxygen treatment or mechanical ventilation. Low birth weight, however, was closely associated with poor airway function independent of neonatal respiratory illness. Other factors of importance included the male gender and maternal smoking. The reduction in airway function observed in the low birthweight children was associated with cough but not wheeze. The disparity between the relatively well preserved vital capacity and reduced airway function suggests that very low birth weight, and hence prematurity, has its greatest effect on the subsequent growth of airway function. The absence of an association between neonatal oxygen score or mechanical ventilation and childhood lung function suggests that the long term effect of neonatal respiratory treatment is small compared with that of birth weight, maternal smoking, and male sex.\r"

The low birthweight children were no more likely to wheeze than the reference group, but frequent and troublesome cough was significantly more common, especially among children of very low birth weight (under 1500 g) who had received neonatal respiratory treatment. Neonatal mechanical ventilation was not associated with increased symptoms when compared with neonatal oxygen treatment alone. The prevalence of cough at the age of 7 was independently associated with the level of neonatal intensive care as defined by oxygen score. Although there was no excess of wheeze in the cohort compared with the reference group, there was a weak correlation between wheeze and the neonatal oxygen score as well as with maternal smoking. Loss of schooling due to respiratory symptoms in the nine months before this study was no greater in children of low birth weight than in the reference group.\r"

After adjustment for potential confounders, an increase in the frequency of spontaneous abortion was associated with detectable levels of mercury; high levels of arsenic, potassium, and silica; moderately hard water, and surface water. In contrast, a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous abortion was associated with high levels of alkalinity and sulfate, and any detectable level of nitrate. These results require further corroboration because there is a paucity of data investigating this issue.\r"

Total mercury concentration values were in good agreement between the two laboratories: the averages were several hundreds of ng/g in kidney cortex, kidney medulla, and liver, and were several tens of ng/g in cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, and spleen. Inorganic mercury accumulated more in kidney and liver: its percentage THg was 81-84% in the kidney, 67% in the liver, 25% in the heart, 22% in the spleen, 20% in the cerebrum, and 14% in the cerebellum. Methylmercury levels in tissues were uniform through all organs except the liver. Approximately 80% was in the form of MeHg in the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, and spleen, whereas the values were 33%, 15%, and 11% in the liver, kidney medulla, and kidney cortex, respectively.

There is comparatively little evidence of the effects of oral, nasal, and oronasal breathing on ozone (O3)-induced responses in humans. In this study, six young adult males were exposed on five occasions to 0.40 parts per million (ppm) O3 while exercising continuously at one of two workloads (minute ventilation, VE, of approximately 30 and 75 l/min). The VE exposure time product was similar for all protocols. Four exposures were delivered randomly with a Hans-Rudolph respiratory valve attached to a silicone facemask, with breathing route effected with and without noseclip. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance revealed no statistically significant differences (p less than .05) across conditions in pulmonary function, exercise ventilatory pattern, or subjective symptoms responses. The fifth exposure, delivered via the same respiratory valve with mouthpiece, but without facemask, revealed significantly greater forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) impairment than that observed for the respiratory valve, facemask with noseclip exposure (-20.4% and -15.9%, respectively). The latter suggests partial O3 reactivity to the facemask and clean shaven facial surface of the subjects, although reduced oral scrubbing by mouthpiece-induced bypassing of the oral vestibule might account, in part, for this difference. Recent O3 uptake evidence from another laboratory, however, supports our conclusion that breathing route during moderate and heavy continuous exercise does not affect acute physiologic responses to 0.40 ppm O3.\r"

Statistically significantly higher isolates of T. cutaneum, total yeasts, and total fungi were associated with unsanitary rooms, and especially with damp places in the wood or tatami mats in patients' homes. Cleaning, disinfecting, and removing the colonizing locations of T. cutaneum were performed. No recurrence was observed in 6 well-cleaned homes, but recurrence was observed in all patients who resided in homes that were not cleaned or in homes where cleaning was not adequate, and where T. cutaneum was not eliminated. The efficacy of therapy by elimination of T. cutaneum was proven.\r"

Moreover, a way to incorporate host responses into the model is outlined, which is straightforward within this new approach, but has not been achieved by existing models to date. Based on empirical data, it is shown that some effects, which arise from additional exposures, can be understood as a kind of host response. This result contrasts with interpretations given by existing models and promises to open interesting discussion regarding which biological processes can be observed by epidemiological data.\r"

The largest cholesterol stone measured 55 mm by 33 mm and the largest bilirubinate stone measured 52 mm by 37 mm. The stones were disintegrated in all but one patient in whom choledochoscopic access to a gallstone was difficult due to deformity of the gallbladder. Complete removal of the stones was achieved in 38 of 39 patients. In a patient with hepatolithiasis, small stones located deep in inaccessible branches of the intrahepatic duct remained unremovable. There were no serious complication. Minor complications occurred, including bleeding from the bile duct mucosa in four patients and postprocedure chills and fever in three. Choledochoscopic lithotomy with electrohydraulic lithotripsy is efficient and useful to remove biliary calculi in patients who are poor surgical risks.\r"

The operative procedures were performed by a single surgeon in each group. For the purpose of comparison, both groups were divided into two subsets: (1) patients with proved reflux, and (2) patients with different indications. The first subset consisted of 30 patients in the Belsey series and 32 in the Nissen series. The remaining patients were included in the second subset. One death occurred in the Belsey series; morbidity consisted of minor pulmonary complications in the Belsey series (10.8%) and spleen injuries requiring splenectomy (5%) in the Nissen series. In patients with proved reflux good-to-excellent results were achieved in 89.3% of subjects of the Belsey series and 86.6% of patients of the Nissen group. The failures rates were 7.1% and 10%, respectively. Inability to vomit and/or belch was reported in 7.1% of patients with proved reflux of the Belsey group and 10% of patients with proved reflux of the Nissen group. In patients with different indications there were no failures after either operation. Finally 82.2% of subjects in the Belsey group and 73.3% of patients in the Nissen group declared that they were satisfied with the operative results. In conclusion the Belsey and the Nissen procedures are equally able to achieve long-term control of reflux disease in comparable groups of patients. Failures and gastrointestinal symptoms are equally frequent after either procedure and do not affect the overall patient acceptance of antireflux surgery.\r"

The incidence of metastases increased with deeper tumor invasion into the stomach wall. Deposits were most common in some perigastric node stations, and their distribution was clearly related to the location of the tumor. Some nonperigastric node stations also were frequently involved, e.g., those around the left gastric artery or in the splenic hilum, and may be considered primary draining nodes. Skip metastases to distant nodes were found in a few per cent of perigastric node-negative patients. Deposits in nodes around the middle colic artery, but not in any other upper abdominal node stations, were incompatible with 5-year survival rates. The analysis favors a so-called R2 or more extensive resection for cancers invading beyond the submucosa.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports of gastrocutaneous fistulas emphasize their benign nature and the probability of spontaneous healing without the need for surgical closure. In distinct contrast we report our experiences with six patients whose gastrocutaneous fistulas were caused by fulminant pancreatitis and pancreatic abscesses. High-output acid fistulas appeared days to weeks after drainage of left upper quadrant-infected collections. None occurred at the time of initial abscess drainage. Most originated high on the greater curvature of the stomach and traversed the abscess cavity. Three of six patients had previous splenectomies, but these operations were remote in time from the appearance of the fistula. Nonoperative management was successful in only two of six patients. Massive hemorrhage from the fistula tract contributed to the deaths of three patients. The pathogenesis of these fistulas appears to be consequent to gastric injury resulting from adjacent pancreatic inflammation. We conclude that (1) gastrocutaneous fistulas associated with pancreatitis are unlikely to heal even with drainage of the abscesses and are often complicated by hemorrhage, (2) surgical closure of the fistula will often be necessary and should not be unreasonably delayed, and (3) when performed in a semi-elective setting, resection of the damaged gastric segment, perhaps with an omental or serosal patch to buttress the gastric suture line, has a good chance of success.\r"

Biliary drainage was performed in 38% of patients for persistent or recurrent jaundice, cholangitis, and while undergoing pancreatic duct or cyst drainage procedures for pain. The benign nature of CBDS in chronic alcohol-induced pancreatitis (CAIP) in patients without persistent jaundice is emphasized. In particular, no histologically proved cases of secondary biliary cirrhosis were noted. The majority of patients with CBDS due to CAIP may be safely managed without biliary bypass but require close follow-up.\r"

Forty-two patients (84%) presented with obstructive symptoms. Patients had a 1- to 30-year history of Crohn's disease (mean, 14 years). Sixty-two per cent of patients were taking steroids at the time of admission, and 70% had had previous small bowel resections. All patients had one or more areas of small bowel affected with a fibrotic stricture and partial obstruction. Short strictures were treated by Heinecke-Mikulicz strictureplasties, and longer strictures by Finney side-to-side strictureplasties. In 30 patients (60%), 6- to 65-cm segments of small bowel were also resected due to acute inflammation with phlegmon or fistulae. Patients were discharged from the hospital 5 to 20 days after operation (mean, 10 days). After operation all patients with obstructive symptoms reported relief of symptoms and weight gain. Steroid doses could be tapered and nutritional parameters, such as total lymphocyte count, and serum albumin improved. Strictureplasty had 0% mortality and 16% morbidity rates. Complications included 3 enterocutaneous fistulae, 2 intra-abdominal abscesses, 2 hemorrhages requiring transfusion, 1 prolonged postoperative ileus that could be treated conservatively in 2 patients, and 1 restricture of a strictureplasty. Patients were followed for 1 to 40 months after operation (mean, 8 months). Resection of small bowel disease, especially that associated with perforation, is usually required in Crohn's disease. However, strictureplasty minimizes the need for bowel resection in patients with short fibrotic strictures resulting in recurrent small bowel obstruction.\r"

Sixty of 252 (24%) splenic injuries were initially treated without operation, which included bed rest, ICU monitoring, frequent physical exams, nasogastric tube, serial hematocrits, and follow-up splenic imaging. Five patients (5 of 60) failed nonoperative management and required interval laparotomy. Reasons for failure included blood loss greater than four units, enlarging splenic defect, or increasing peritoneal signs. Parameters predicting a successful outcome were localized trauma to the left flank or abdomen, hemodynamic stability, transfusion requirements less than four units, rapid return of GI function, age less than 60 years, and early resolution of splenic defects on imaging studies. No morbidity or deaths resulted from delayed operative intervention. In carefully selected adult patients, blunt splenic trauma may be successfully managed without operation.\r"

  ".W": "Among hypertensive and diabetic patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, preoperative status and intraoperative changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were evaluated as predictors of postoperative ischemic complications. Of 254 patients evaluated before operation and monitored during operation, 30 (12%) had postoperative cardiac death, ischemia, or infarction. Twenty-four per cent of patients with a previous myocardial infarction or cardiomegaly had an ischemic postoperative cardiac complication. Only 7% of those without either of these conditions sustained an ischemic complication. No other preoperative characteristics, including the presence of angina, predicted ischemic cardiac risk. Nineteen per cent of patients who had 20 mm Hg or more intraoperative decreases in MAP lasting 60 minutes or more had ischemic cardiac complications. Patients who had more than 20 mm Hg decreases in MAP lasting 5 to 59 minutes and more than 20 mm Hg increases lasting 15 minutes or more also had increased complications (p less than 0.03). Changes in pulse were not independent predictors of complications and the use of the rate-pressure product did not improve prediction based on MAP alone. In conclusion patients with a previous infarction or radiographic cardiomegaly are at high risk for postoperative ischemic complications. Prolonged intraoperative increases or decreases of 20 mm or more in MAP also resulted in a significant increase in these potentially life-threatening surgical complications.\r"

In 149 cases the diagnosis of in situ disease was confirmed. One hundred and eight patients had 109 ductal carcinomas in situ, 38 patients had lobular carcinomas in situ, with 3 patients having both. A multitude of treatments was used, ranging from local excision to radical mastectomy. Survival at a mean of 6 years follow-up was equal in all groups, with only two patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ dying from clinically suspected systemic disease. In patients treated by local excision, ipsilateral cancers were seen in 12% of ductal carcinoma in situ patients who had local excision and 13% of patients with lobular carcinoma in situ. Contralateral metachronous invasive cancers were seen in 6% of ductal carcinoma in situ patients and 3% of lobular carcinoma in situ patients. No lymph node involvement was seen in any of these patients, either with prophylactic dissection or in follow-up. The conclusion reached was that both in situ lesions are similar in their clinical course. Lymph node dissection is not necessary. Pathologic review is critical for accurate studies, with a change in diagnosis of 36% of diagnoses. Treatment does not appear to affect prognosis. The most appropriate treatment needs to be determined in prospective randomized trials.\r"

For this purpose the long-term results (up to 20 years of follow-up) of 518 patients with implanted arterial prostheses in the aortoiliofemoral tract were retrospectively evaluated. Completeness of follow-up data was 83.2% 15 years after operation. A total of 101 false aneurysms (21 aortic, 53 iliac, and 27 femoral) were detected in 69 patients and verified by operation. The incidence per patient was 69 of 518 patients (13.3%). The incidences per anastomosis were: aortic, 21 of 438 anastomoses (4.8%); iliac, 53 of 835 anastomoses (6.3%); and femoral, 27 of 198 anastomoses (13.6%). Almost one half (47.5%) of all the false aneurysms were asymptomatic and were detected by angiography or ultrasonography. Chances for late survivors to develop a false aneurysm during follow-up were calculated by the life-table method. The chance to be free of a false aneurysm at any site was 77.2% 15 years after operation. These chances were 92.3%, 84.5%, and 76.2% for aortic, iliac, and femoral anastomoses, respectively. Analyses of subgroups showed that the development of a false aneurysm was significantly correlated with the presence of hypertension, multilevel disease, the type of suture material, and the type of anastomosis. These results indicate unexpectedly high chances for the development of false aneurysms in long-term survivors after aortoiliac or aortofemoral prosthetic reconstructions. We advocate the use of a life-long follow-up schedule with periodic angiography and ultrasonography for these patients.\r"

Our initial experience with human open fetal surgery reinforces experimental observations that the fetal wounds heal without the scarring, inflammation, and contraction that often accompany adult wounds. In this study we examine fetal wound fluid in an attempt to elucidate the control mechanisms that endow the fetus with unique healing properties. The extracellular matrix of fetal wounds is rich in hyaluronic acid, a glycosaminoglycan found in high concentrations whenever there is tissue proliferation, regeneration, and repair. We establish that wound fluid from the fetus contains high levels of hyaluronic acid-stimulating activity that may underlie the elevated deposition of hyaluronic acid in the fetal wound matrix. In contrast there was no hyaluronic acid-stimulating activity present in adult wound fluid. Hyaluronic acid, in turn, fosters an extracellular environment permissive for cell motility and proliferation that may account for the unique properties observed in fetal wound healing.\r"

The 6-year actuarial survival was a disappointing 36% because of a high perioperative mortality (12 of 32, 37.5%) and because of five late deaths due to uncontrolable rejection. The perioperative mortality was a staggering 60% (6 of 10) for the patients with congenital heart disease. Four of the 6 recipients with congenital heart disease died because of acute failure of the donor right ventricle. This included 2 patients who required reconstruction of the pulmonary arteries for stenosis secondary to previous systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and 2 others in whom the pulmonary vascular resistances were underestimated because of undetected recent pulmonary emboli (1) and complicated pulmonary vascular anatomy (1). Five of the six late deaths were due to rejection-related events, and all were patients with acquired cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Between August 1985 and December 1988, valvotomized saphenous vein grafts were used in 365 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In this operation, the femoral end of the vein is attached to the aorta and the pedal end is attached to the coronary artery. Vein diameters measured 8 +/- 2 mm at the femoral end, 4.5 +/- 1.2 mm at the knee level, and 3.5 +/- 1.3 mm at the ankle. Ratios between levels were as follows: knee to femoral end, 0.56, and ankle to femoral end, 0.43. The ratio of knee to femoral end was 0.42 in cases with vein midthigh bifurcation. There were 1,310 grafts implanted (3.6 per patient). In 341 patients, CABG alone was performed, and 24 patients had combined procedures: 11 had CABG with mitral valve replacement, 9 had CABG with aortic valve replacement, 2 had CABG with repair of postinfarct ventricular septal defect, and 2 had CABG with automatic defibrillator implantation. Follow-up (up to 3.5 years) was attained in 97% of patients. For various reasons, 34 patients had a second angiogram between 3 and 41 months postoperatively. Of 120 vein grafts, 108 (90%) were patent. At autopsy, 11 patients with 45 vein grafts had 43 patent and clean grafts and two thrombosed. Use of nonreversed saphenous vein for coronary bypass is recommended. It assures a large proximal anastomosis, natural vein bifurcations can be used with fewer proximal anastomoses, better vein-coronary artery size matching is obtained, and the patency rate is satisfactory.\r"

Distal anastomoses between internal mammary artery and coronary artery were achieved using the laser technique, which includes four stay sutures of 7-0 polypropylene and tissue welding between the stays by the laser at a power level of 65 mW. Short-term luminal patency was 100% without stenosis by angiography. Microscopy and histology showed that CO2 laser caused medial change resulting in fusion with preservation of normal intimal morphology. The aortocoronary bypass operation using a CO2 laser is technically feasible, and this technique may open up a new method for patients with small peripheral coronary artery obstruction and for pediatric patients with certain conditions (eg, Kawasaki disease).\r"

This procedure has the potential of being used in pediatric patients to enlarge a hypoplastic ventricle or to reinforce the right atrium in the Fontan procedure. The growth potential of such a myograft was studied. Young piglets weighing 18 to 22 kg underwent right latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty while the latissimus dorsi weight and myoplasty area were measured. In half of the animals, the myograft was not stimulated and in the others it was continuously stimulated with an atrioventricular sequential pacemaker to contract in synchrony with the heart. Two months later, with doubling of body weight, the hearts were removed for study. In both groups, significant (p less than 0.05) increase in latissimus dorsi weight (+92% +/- 15% nonpaced versus +77% +/- 3% paced) and myoplasty area (+107% +/- 13% nonpaced versus +116% +/- 30% paced) were noted. The results in stimulated versus nonstimulated animals were not significantly different. Thus, not only does cardiomyoplasty offer a contractile tissue to repair or enlarge cardiac chambers, but this tissue can also grow in young patients and avoid subsequent size mismatch.\r"

The hazard function for reoperation had an initial very rapidly declining phase and a second phase that was still rising 15 years after operation. Twelve (17%; confidence limits [CL], 13% to 23%) of 69 patients with a right atrial to right ventricular conduit (valved or nonvalved) connection underwent reoperation for pathway obstruction, whereas only 2 (4%; CL, 1% to 10%) of 45 patients with a direct connection to the right ventricle required reoperation. Five (8%; CL, 4% to 13%) of 65 patients with a right atrial to pulmonary artery conduit connection required reoperation for pathway obstruction, and only 2 (1.3%; CL, 0.4% to 3%) of 155 patients with a direct right atrial to pulmonary artery connection required reoperation. These findings have implications as to the optimal technique of the Fontan operation and also as to use of an intraatrial tunnel as part of the repair.\r"

There were 67 male and 29 female patients ranging in age from 8 to 80 years. Thirty-seven patients had fibrotic stricture secondary to corrosive injury of the esophagus, 42 had cancer of the esophagus, and 17 had cancer of the gastric cardia. The incidence of postoperative complications and surgical mortality, respectively, was 16.2% and 2.7% for patients with corrosive stricture of the esophagus, 35.7% and 11.9% for patients with cancer of the esophagus, and 35.2% and 5.8% for patients with cancer of the gastric cardia. Reconstruction resulted in good function in 75.6% of the patients with corrosive stricture of the esophagus, 66.6% of the patients with cancer of the esophagus, and 70.5% of patients with cancer of the gastric cardia. The morbidity and mortality were higher in the group with malignant esophageal strictures because of advanced age, poor general condition of the patient, and extent of the surgical procedure needed. Cervical anastomotic leakage was the most frequently encountered complication (13.5%), and all the poor-function results were caused by this complication. In our experience, reconstruction of the esophagus with left colon is a satisfactory method that can be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and mortality. The left colon is a durable and functional substitute.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary hypertension is associated with an increased perioperative mortality for orthotopic heart transplantation. A transpulmonary gradient greater than 15 mm Hg or a pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 5 Woods units increases mortality secondary to right heart failure. This study compares amrinone with conventional therapy in 38 transplant candidates with pulmonary hypertension. All patients had elevated transpulmonary gradient, pulmonary vascular resistance, or both. Group 1 (n = 21) received prolonged continuous intravenous amrinone therapy, whereas group 2 (n = 16) received high-dose oral diuretics, digitalis, and captopril. Both groups 1 and 2 had decreased pulmonary hypertension, transpulmonary gradient, and pulmonary vascular resistance. However, amrinone was more effective, with a 86% response rate versus 63% response for conventional therapy. Survival awaiting transplantation was significantly higher in group 1 (20 of 22, 91%) than in group 2 (10 of 16, 63%). Although both groups 1 and 2 had significantly decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, only group 2 had significantly decreased systemic vascular resistance. Comparison of pulmonary vascular resistance after therapy showed that the response in group 1 (amrinone) was significantly lower than the response in group 2 (conventional therapy), suggesting that amrinone may function as a direct vasodilator of the pulmonary vasculature. There were no operative deaths or episodes of perioperative right heart failure in either group. Amrinone appears to be more effective and safe than conventional therapy in the treatment of prospective heart transplant candidates with pulmonary hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1978 through February 1989, 110 tricuspid annuloplasties (De Vega's procedure) were performed in association with mitral and combined mitral and aortic valve disease. Preoperatively, 106 (96%) of 110 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. There were seven early deaths (6.3%), and 3 patients, 2 with mitral lesions and 1 with a combined lesion, died during a follow-up period of 3 to 52 months (mean follow-up, 22 months). Four patients (3.6%) required reoperation because of biological mitral valve failure at 5 to 8 years after tricuspid annuloplasty (mean period, 6.6 years). Twenty-three (62%) of 37 randomly selected patients evaluated by echocardiography and 14 (70%) of 20 patients evaluated by right ventriculography showed complete disappearance of tricuspid regurgitation after tricuspid annuloplasty in 1 to 18 months (mean period, 3.3 months). Seventy-seven (96%) of the survivors were in functional class I or II after tricuspid annuloplasty. The actuarial survival rate for the TAP series including early deaths was 85.8% +/- 7.4% at 10 years and the actuarial rate of freedom from reoperation on the tricuspid valve was 96.7% +/- 1.4%. Our surgical experience indicates that the De Vega's annuloplasty, as the method of first choice, is a simple, reliable procedure and resulted in improvement in 90% of patients with moderate to severe functional tricuspid regurgitation.\r"

Neither group had any incidence of bronchopleural fistula. Bronchial anastomosis was accomplished in patients who underwent sleeve resection, reducing the number of sutures required to four apposing sutures, with the tissue adhesive ensuring an airtight closure. There was no incidence of bronchial stenosis. The efficacy of n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate in preventing fistula formation after bronchial resections makes it an ideal agent in pulmonary surgery. Its use obviated the use of pedicled pleural flap, thus ensuring pleural integrity for extrapleural continuous intercostal nerve blockade for postoperative analgesia.\r"

To minimize cross-clamp time and reduce the incidence of such complications, we have used an intraluminal ring graft to reestablish aortic continuity in patients with descending thoracic aortic lesions. From March 1978 to December 1986, we used this technique alone in 28 patients. There were 4 patients with traumatic aortic disruptions, 4 with dissections, 4 with expanding aneurysms, 2 with ruptured aneurysms, 1 with Marfan's syndrome, and 13 with atherosclerotic aneurysms that were repaired electively. The cross-clamp times ranged from 4 to 28 minutes. There were three early postoperative deaths (within 30 days) and one late postoperative death in the follow-up period (mean, 28.2 months). Ring dislodgement occurred only once, in the first patient in this series. There were no instances of postoperative renal failure or paraplegia. We conclude that the use of an intraluminal ring graft greatly reduces the aortic cross-clamp time and is a safe and effective technique.\r"

Cardiomegaly and metabolic acidosis were prominent in group 1. Five of the 9 patients in group 1 died in the immediate postoperative period (56% mortality), but no operative deaths occurred among 8 patients in group 2 (p less than 0.01). The ratio of left ventricular outflow tract to ascending aortic diameter was 0.59 +/- 0.09 in group 1 and 1.03 +/- 0.11 in group 2 (p less than 0.01). Three of 4 patients with a ratio of less than 0.6 died, but no operative deaths occurred among the 6 patients who had a palliative operation and in whom the ratio was more than 0.6. These data suggest that left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is critical when the ratio of left ventricular outflow tract to ascending aortic diameter is 0.6 or less. The presence of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction necessitates modification of the present surgical strategy.\r"

Traumatic aortic rupture occurred in 2 of 99 patients with sternal fractures (2%) and in 75 of 2,106 patients without sternal fracture (3.6%). This difference was not statistically significant by the Fisher exact test (p = 0.326).

This model combines resident analysis of the patient encounter via a \"clinical encounter form\" (CEF) with faculty-led ambulatory medicine rounds (AMR). Its objectives are to integrate teaching and quality assessment; be explicit about the relation between the record and the physician's clinical thinking; teach around every patient; focus on selected aspects of a case in limited time; and permit appropriate rounds preparation by faculty. The CEF-AMR model, like inpatient rounds, allows teaching to be focused on real patient issues; all patients are reviewed and quality is assured, and interesting teaching points can be selected, prepared, and discussed efficiently in limited time. It is the \"classroom\" complement to faculty \"bedside\" precepting and has made teaching ambulatory medicine feasible, clinically relevant, and well-informed. Perhaps most importantly, the CEF-AMR model encourages self-analysis of clinical decisions and makes explicit the key elements of clinical judgment.\r"

One patient received a 35 mg/kg course of amphotericin B without clinical improvement, but responded appropriately to corticosteroid therapy. Another patient had positive sputum cultures for Histoplasma capsulatum 5 years after initial diagnosis of sarcoidosis, but showed no improvement in the pulmonary infiltrate after treatment with amphotericin B. Although histoplasmosis and sarcoidosis may be interrelated in several ways, we postulate that H capsulatum may have triggered a chronic inflammatory disease recognized as sarcoidosis in some of these patients, a hypothesis yet to be tested. Alternative explanations for the association of histoplasmosis and sarcoidosis include the coincidental occurrence of two separate illnesses in a \"hyperendemic\" area for histoplasmosis and false-positive serologic test results caused by the heightened humoral immune response observed in sarcoidosis.\r"

We used population-based data to estimate a woman's lifetime risk of suffering a hip, Colles', or vertebral fracture and her risk of dying of coronary heart disease. A 50-year-old white woman has a 16% risk of suffering a hip fracture, a 15% risk of suffering a Colles' fracture, and a 32% risk of suffering a vertebral fracture during her remaining lifetime. These risks exceed her risk of developing breast or endometrial cancer. She has a 31% risk of dying of coronary heart disease, which is about 10 times greater than her risk of dying of hip fractures or breast cancer. These lifetime risks provide a useful description of the comparative risks of conditions that might be influenced by postmenopausal hormone therapy.\r"

Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, and race. Patients with ILE had symptoms for an average of 38 months before seeking rheumatologic care and were followed up for a mean of 19 months; patients with SLE averaged 9 months with symptoms before their diagnosis was made and were followed for a mean of 30 months. Characteristic clinical features of patients with ILE included positive antinuclear antibody titers (83%), polyarticular nonerosive arthritis (47%), and cutaneous findings (61%). These were comparable with findings in the the SLE group. However, patients with ILE had significantly fewer systemic manifestations than did those with SLE. Patients with ILE were treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more frequently (47%) than were patients with SLE, while the latter group received more topical and oral corticosteroids and immunosuppressives. Only two of the patients with ILE went on to have typical SLE. Thus, ILE may be frequent, mild, and relatively stable or benign, apparently evolving slowly if at all into SLE or other rheumatic disease.\r"

After 11,680 people were screened in a city of 85,000 people, 3069 (26.3%) were referred to their private physicians. Three months later a questionnaire was mailed to 76 local primary care physicians, and a follow-up letter was mailed to those who had not responded after 2 months. The response rate was 76% from a total of seven specialties, primarily internal medicine and family medicine. Seventy-nine percent of the physicians had been aware of the program, 40% diagnosed at least one case of hypercholesterolemia as a result of the program, and 71% approved of community cholesterol screening. Only one physician indicated that he was overwhelmed with referrals. We conclude that most primary-care physicians support community cholesterol screening as a public health measure and will use screening data to initiate diagnosis.\r"

Based on our analysis of clinical variables predictive of significant radiographic abnormalities and our assessment of clinically important findings, we propose the following indications for admission chest radiographs in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: white blood cell count above 15 x 10(9)/L and polymorphonuclear leukocyte count above 8 x 10(9)/L, history of congestive heart failure, history of coronary artery disease, chest pain, or edema. In view of the low yield of clinically significant abnormalities, we believe that routine chest radiographs need not be performed in this patient population. The use of selective criteria could eliminate unnecessary studies while assuring recognition of important new radiographic abnormalities.\r"

We assessed the ability of patients to regulate their own therapy based on fingerstick prothrombin times (PTs) in order to avoid these problems. Such management was made possible by the availability of a device capable of measuring a PT from a capillary sample of whole blood. Sixteen patients adjusted their warfarin therapy based on specially developed guidelines for a mean duration of 43 weeks (range, 8 to 92 weeks). Four hundred fifty-eight PTs were measured by patients at home during the entire study. Three hundred ninety-three were in therapeutic range and patients correctly continued their dosages. Of the 65 nontherapeutic PTs, patients made correct dose adjustments in 49 and incorrect adjustments in 16. These incorrect adjustments were minor and judged to be clinically insignificant. They often resulted from a misunderstanding of the dosage guidelines. Given the slow onset of warfarin's effect, the assessment of the PT on a weekly or biweekly basis, and the ability to refine dosage guidelines, these errors were not felt to represent a serious drawback to the concept of warfarin self-management. No complications of therapy occurred during the study. Although this mode of therapy needs further evaluation, this pilot study suggests that patient self-management is feasible and that this model of anticoagulant care offers the potential for improved care at reduced cost.\r"

Twenty-four-hour urine volume, creatinine clearance, calcium-creatinine ratio, and phosphorus-creatinine ratio were similar during consumption of the diet high in nonalcoholic carbonated beverages and the control diet. Twenty-four-hour cyclic adenosine monophosphate-creatinine ratio was significantly lower in women consuming the diet high in nonalcoholic carbonated beverage compared with women receiving the control diet (342 +/- 27.4 nmol/mmol vs 409 +/- 22.1 nmol/mmol). Consumption of a diet high in nonalcoholic carbonated beverages on a short-term basis does not appear to affect adversely the serum or urinary markers of calcium metabolism.\r"

Responses were obtained for 855 of 3000 patients on dialysis representing 17 of 39 participating dialysis units within the network. Almost 40% of the patients surveyed had been receiving dialysis therapy for over 3 years. Patients on hemodialysis (83% of the study group) had the water used to prepare the dialysate pretreated. Serum aluminum determinations were obtained in 240 (28%) of the 855 patients; other methods of assessing body aluminum burden were performed in less than 10% of the survey population. When obtained, elevated serum aluminum measurements were more likely to be found with each year patients were given dialysis and with each year patients were treated with oral aluminum gels. With the exception of patients with bone pain, clinical signs and symptoms did not correlate with elevated serum aluminum. However, the prevalence of muscle weakness, bone pain, fractures, and dementia in the survey group did correlate with years on dialysis and/or years receiving oral aluminum gels. Data gathered from this survey are consistent with the view that signs and symptoms suggestive of an increased body aluminum burden occur in the minority of patients on dialysis. Nevertheless, patients at risk for aluminum intoxication (years on dialysis, years receiving gels, patients with clinical signs) may not be adequately identified.\r"

During the 12-month follow-up period, 252 men (52%) and 48 women (49%) reported at least one such injury. The multiple logistic regression results identified that running 64.0 km (40 miles) or more per week was the most important predictor of injury for men during the follow-up period (odds ratio = 2.9). Risk also was associated with having had a previous injury in the past year (odds ratio = 2.7) and with having been a runner for less than 3 years (odds ratio = 2.2). These results suggest that the incidence of lower-extremity injuries is high for habitual runners, and that for those new to running or those who have been previously injured, reducing weekly distance is a reasonable preventive behavior.\r"

Aggressive treatment of asthma and associated respiratory tract infections, as well as careful ambulatory care, to encourage patient compliance are advisable to achieve a favorable maternal-fetal outcome.\r"

An unrecognized and untreated Mg depletion can lead to a refractory K repletion. We describe two patients with hypomagnesemia-associated refractory hypokalemia following cisplatin following cisplatin therapy. Potassium supplementation failed to replace the K deficit. Profound hypokalemia persisted until hypomagnesemia was recognized and corrected. In neither patient was the concurrent hypomagnesemia recognized until the 11th and 9th hospital days. These two cases demonstrated the association of a refractory K repletion and an Mg deficiency. Thus, both serum K ion and Mg levels should routinely be assessed in patients who require cisplatin therapy.\r"

The approximate incidence rate for thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in our largely white North American patient population (all hyperthyroidism cases) ranged from 0.1% to 0.2%, which is one tenth the rate reported for Oriental populations.

In the month before the first panic 52% of the patients had prodromal depression or anxiety. Agoraphobic avoidance preceded the first panic in 23%, began within days after the first panic in 32% (without prodromal anxiety or depression in only 20%), and after more than one panic (1 week to 11 years later) in 41%. The site of the first panic was from the agoraphobic cluster (public places) in 81%, at work or school in 11%, and inside the home in 8%. Thirty-eight percent of patients were with a familiar adult at the time. Many features of the syndrome can be explained by an integrated model with several interacting factors contributing in varying degrees to the different routes by which it develops. To the learning and biological factors already suggested we add an evolutionary factor to explain why most first panics occur outside the home and mainly in public places. Certain extraterritorial cues constituting an agoraphobic cluster seem to be prepotent and prepared triggers or modifiers of fear during stress.\r"

The three groups were similar in age, gender distribution, and brain weight. Most patients had never received neuroleptics, and the two patient groups had had similar types of leukotomies. We used a semiautomated image analysis system to compute volume and pyramidal-cell density in each of the four sectors of the cornu ammonis, Ca1 through CA4, in the right and left hippocampi. Sections from schizophrenic patients had almost consistently the lowest volume and pyramidal-cell density in all sectors. The differences were greatest in left CA4, with schizophrenic patients having significantly lower pyramidal-cell density than normal controls and significantly lower volume than leukotomy controls. Our findings confirm the results of several recent studies showing hippocampal pathologic features in schizophrenia. Our study suggests, however, that the hippocampal neuropathologic findings in schizophrenia may be more subtle and more localized than those reported previously.\r"

Electroencephalograms were recorded from the 19 standard 10-20 electrode sites. Compared with controls, both groups of schizophrenics had reduced P3 amplitudes for both effortful and automatic paradigms. P3 latencies were delayed relative to controls for the medication-taking schizophrenics in the effortful paradigms. Negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale within 1 week of event-related potential testing correlated negatively with both auditory and visual P3 amplitude in the subjects who were not taking medication. There was no evidence that P3 is smaller over left temporal electrode sites in schizophrenics, as has been reported by others. P3 amplitude reduction in schizophrenia is a robust psychobiological phenomenon that is present regardless of medication status or task demands.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that the hypercortisolism and dexamathasone resistance of depression arise, at least in part, at the level of the brain, ie, cortisol-releasing factor (CRF) and/or other corticotropin-secretagogues are hypersecreted. This article suggests a similar cause of the hypercortisolism of social subordinance. Two troops of wild olive baboons, living freely in the Serengeti Ecosystem of East Africa, have been under long-term study. Consistently, in stable dominance hierachies, subordinate males are hypercortisolemic relative to dominant animals. Furthermore, hypercortisolemic males are dexamethasone resistant. There are no rank-related difference in cortisol clearance or adrenal sensitivity to corticotropin, suggesting a pituitary and/or neural locus of the hypercortisolism. Subordinate males were shown to secrete less corticotropin in response to a CRF-challenge than did dominant males. Following the logic used in similar studies with depressives, if subordinate males were hypercortisolemic despite decreased pituitary sensitivity to CRF, then this implies that the hyperactivity of the adrenocortical axis is driven at the level of the brain. Furthermore, subordinate males were hyporesponsive to CRF after administration of metyrapone, which blocks cortisol secretion and disinhibits the pituitary from feedback inhibition. Thus, the pituitary appears to have lost sensitivity to CRF itself in these low-ranking males. These observations are interpreted in light of behavioral data suggesting that these subordinate males are under sustained social stress.\r"

  ".U": "90055719\r", 
  ".W": "Sixty patients with agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder who completed a 4-month combined drug and behavioral group treatment program and were discharged on a regimen of alprazolam were interviewed 1.7 to 4 years (mean, 2.5 years) after discharge. At follow-up (FU), 18 (30%) of the patients had discontinued alprazolam treatment, 36 (60%) continued with a lower dose, 3 (5%) received the same dose, and 3 (5%) received an increased dose compared with discharge. A lower frequency of panic attacks at admission was associated with an increased ability to discontinue alprazolam treatment. There was little evidence of tolerance to the antipanic effects of alprazolam. Panic attack frequency dropped from a mean of 4.4 attacks per week at admission to 1.2 attacks per week at discharge and remained decreased at 1.6 attacks per week at FU. Treatment gains in the program were maintained or enhanced on 11 of 14 behavioral measures at FU and were similar in the groups that were receiving and not receiving alprazolam. Patients receiving nonpharmacologic therapy in the FU period tended to have greater symptom severity, possibly due to self-selection. A lifetime diagnosis of major depression at admission was associated with higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and higher alprazolam doses at FU. Episodes of major depression were common in the FU period and did not appear to be prevented by initial alprazolam and behavioral therapy or by low-dose alprazolam maintenance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cystosarcoma phylloides of the breast is a tumor composed of breast ducts and a cellular stromal component that can be benign or malignant. The origin of the stromal cells is controversial. We undertook an immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study of 11 cases of cystosarcoma phylloides to assess the histogenesis of the stromal component. By light microscopy, 4 were diagnosed as benign, and 7 were diagnosed as malignant. Antibodies to vimentin, desmin, actin, high- and low-molecular-weight keratins, and S100 protein were used for immunohistochemical staining. In the 4 benign cases of cystosarcoma phylloides, the stromal cells stained positively only for vimentin. In the malignant tumors, the spindle cell component stained for vimentin in all the cases. In addition, the malignant stromal cells coexpressed desmin in two cases and keratin and S 100 protein in another case. By electron microscopy the stromal component in the benign case and in two of five malignant cases was composed of a mixture of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. The entire neoplastic stroma in two other malignant cases showed features of smooth-muscle differentiation, whereas in another case all the stromal cells showed myoepithelial differentiation. Thus, in benign and malignant cystosarcoma phylloides, the stromal component consists of a mixture of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Leiomyosarcomas and myoepitheliomas can mimic malignant cystosarcoma phylloides, but immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy can differentiate these entities. This is important since their biologic behavior is different.\r"

These confirmed the immunohistochemical evidence, and led to major changes in patient management. Several similar cases were found in the literature. In cancer cases with a protracted course, but with atypical or discordant clinical and/or pathologic features, diagnostic immunohistochemistry for thyroid markers may merit consideration because of the potential for meaningful changes in clinical management.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular heterogeneity produced by non-Schwannian elements may distinguish neurofibromas from other Schwann cell neoplasma and contribute to a different tumor biology. The present study compared cell counts of mast cells, T and B lymphocytes, and macrophages in 32 neurofibromas with those in 27 schwannomas, 9 malignant nerve sheath tumors, and 17 traumatic neuromas. Immunohistochemical and histochemical analyses were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using two monoclonal antibodies against B-lymphocyte epitopes (LN-1 and LN-2), one monoclonal antibody against T-lymphocyte epitopes (UCHL-1), one polyclonal antibody recognizing alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), a macrophage/histiocytemarker, and toluidine blue O stains. Neurofibromas contained relatively high concentrations of mast cells significantly greater than the concentrations in other neoplastic or reactive nerve sheath tumors. Most neurofibromas also displayed moderate concentrations of LN-2 immunoreactive cells, similar to the concentrations in traumatic neuromas and not statistically different from cell counts in other tumor types. Limited, variable LN-1 and UCHL-1 immunoreactive infiltrates were detected in neurofibromas and some peripheral schwannomas. Rare or moderate ACT immunoreactivity was detected in the majority of neurofibromas, in contrast with the absence, or rare appearance, of ACT immunostaining in cranial and peripheral nerve schwannomas and moderate numbers of immunoreactive cells in many malignant nerve sheath tumors. Mast cells are an important cellular marker of neurofibromas and may participate in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms.\r"

Aortoenteric fistulas involved the duodenum in 16 (57%), esophagus in 9 (32%), and other gastrointestinal sites in 3 patients (11%). They involved the abdominal aorta in 20 cases (71%) and descending thoracic aorta in 8 cases (29%). Exsanguination from aortoenteric fistulas was the cause of death in 23 cases (82%). Major risk factors for aortoenteric fistulas are aortic bypass grafts and gastrointestinal carcinomas.\r"

First, to our knowledge, it represents only the second reported instance of fungemia with S schenckii that responded to medical therapy. Second, it illustrates that in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests may predict clinical infection response to drug therapy. Third, it suggests that itraconazole has significant promise in treating systemic sporotrichosis.\r"

At autopsy, widespread disseminated CMV infection was found, with CMV-associated foci of acute inflammation and necrosis in the pancreas and in the surgically resected gallbladder. A review of our autopsy files revealed only one renal transplant patient with CMV inclusions and chronic pancreatitis. No pancreatitis was seen in 27 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Cytomegalovirus should be considered as a possible cause of pancreatitis and cholecystitis in immunocompromised patients.\r"

Employing two current immunoassays for hepatitis B surface antigen, we could not detect this marker in individuals either 1 hour or 24 hours after vaccination. We therefore conclude that the presence of surface antigen in the blood cannot be attributed to recent vaccination.\r"

Problems relating to histogenesis and to taxonomy are addressed using neurocristic dysplasias of the skin as models. It is believed that melanin production should not be the only criterion used to classify pigmented neurocristic dysplasias arising in extracutaneous mesenchyme.

Patients were categorized according to the type of orthotic prescription (knee-ankle-foot orthosis [KAFO] or ankle-foot orthosis [AFO]) or upper extremity assistive device (cane, crutches, or walker) used during gait. The rates of O2 consumption per minute, O2 cost per meter, heart rate, respiratory quotient, velocity, cadence, and peak axial load exerted by the arms on upper extremity assistive devices were measured. The Ambulatory Motor Index (AMI), derived from the manual muscle grades of both lower limbs, was used as the indicator of the degree of paralysis. The AMI was strongly correlated with the percentage increase in the rate of O2 consumption above normal (p less than .0001), O2 cost per meter (p less than .0001), peak axial load (p less than .0001), velocity (p less than .0001), and cadence (p less than .0001). Differences in these parameters among patient groups categorized according to the type of orthotic prescription (no KAFO, one KAFO, two KAFOs) or upper extremity assistive device (no device, cane or one crutch, two crutches, or walker) were attributable to differences in the AMI. The AMI, therefore, could be used as a reliable clinical indicator of functional mobility after spinal cord injury.\r"

Motor status was measured within 72 hours of injury and quantified with the Motor Index Score (MIS). Functional status was evaluated with the Modified Barthel Index (MBI). A senior physical therapist completed the MIS and the MBI when each patient was admitted to the spinal cord intensive care unit and every 30 days during rehabilitation. Early motor function was correlated with average daily improvement in functional status including self-care and mobility (p = .001). The initial MIS strongly correlated with functional status of quadriplegics at admission (p = .001), at 60 days, and at rehabilitation discharge (p = .001). In paraplegics, the overall MBI at admission, after 60 days of rehabilitation, and at discharge was not correlated with early motor function. However, the MIS correlated significantly with the MBI self-care subscore at 60 days and at discharge (p = .01), but not with the mobility subscore. The initial MIS was also significantly correlated to functional status at discharge in patients with complete lesions (p = .001), but was not related to functional status at discharge in patients with incomplete lesions. The MIS appears to be a useful tool in predicting function during rehabilitation, although individual differences in ambulation, particularly for patients with paraplegia, limit the predictive utility of this index.\r"

Nondominant power grip and bone mineral content of the midradius were measured in 63 healthy postmenopausal Caucasian women. Significant positive correlations (p less than 0.001) were noted between regional bone mineral content and nondominant power grip, and significant negative correlations (p less than 0.001) were found between nondominant power grip and age and between regional bone mineral content and age. When bone mineral data were normalized for skeletal size, there was no significant improvement of the correlation. In addition, the correlation between grip strength and bone mineral content at the midradius was not sufficiently strong to permit the use of grip strength measurements for prediction of midradius bone mineral content for clinical decision-making or epidemiologic studies. Furthermore, the correlation between grip strength and bone mineral content at the muscle insertion site was not better than the correlation between grip strength and bone mineral content at more distal sites on the same bone.\r"

Fifty-one patients (49 females, 2 males) between the ages of 12 and 47 (means = 22.5) who met the criteria for AN of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, were randomly selected from an inpatient eating disorders unit during 15 months. Fifty healthy volunteers (41 females, 9 males) between the ages of 17 and 50 (means = 26.5) served as controls. After a neurologic history, all patients were evaluated by physical examination and standardized electrodiagnostic testing. Chi-square contingency testing was used to assess data. Four study group patients (8%) had electrodiagnostic evidence of a sensorimotor PN compared with none in the control group. This is approaching statistical significance (p = 0.13). Three of four patients with AN for at least ten years were among those with PN. The prevalence of subjective symptoms among the study group (65%) as compared to the control group (4%) was of marked significance (p = 5.62 x 10(-10]. In addition, three anorexic patients were found to have an isolated peroneal nerve palsy. We conclude that PN is a notable complication of AN, particularly in long-standing cases. The PN is most likely a product of chronic malnutrition rather than a specific nutrient deficiency. Patients with AN also appear to be at increased risk for developing localized compression neuropathies secondary to subcutaneous tissue loss.\r"

  ".W": "In Lind's auto-traction (LAT) for lumbago-sciatica, the patient provides traction force by pulling with the arms on a specially designed table, which also allows painless mobilization of the lumbar spine and passive traction. Two studies reported that one to 15 one-hour sessions on successive days might be sufficient to relieve pain in 25% to 90% of cases with verified lumbar disc herniation. Unfortunately, the technique imposes tiring manual efforts on the therapist and requires that the patient be transported by ambulance and confined to bed for a long time. These inconveniences were removed in a new version of the treatment proposed by Natchev. The effectiveness of Natchev's auto-traction (NAT) was evaluated in an open prospective trial on 77 patient with chronic lumbago-sciatica refractory to previous therapies, and herniation of one or more lumbar discs verified by computed tomography (CT) or myelography. Thirty-six of the 77 patients (47%) responded to the treatment in three to ten (median = 5) half-hour sessions. Pain intensity dropped to 27% (median) of the pretreatment intensity. Six months after treatment, 28 of the 36 responders were stable; only four had undergone surgery. By contrast, 20 of the 41 nonresponders had been operated on. The severity of either the radiologic or the neurologic picture was not predictive of the outcome. NAT was as effective as LAT: thus, due to its greater convenience it appears to be suitable as a routine approach in lumbar disc herniation and as a screening technique before surgery.\r"

Maximal voluntary isometric contractions were recorded immediately before and after the stimulation sessions and showed a significant reduction after stimulation, with no difference between the two stimulators. There was no significant difference between the stimulators in the amount of torque produced. The torque during stimulation with Electro-Stim 180 showed a larger variability than with Respond. With both stimulators there was a decrease in the torque produced with an increase in number of contractions. There was no qualitative or quantitative difference between the two stimulators in the perceived discomfort. The low-frequency stimulator has a theoretical advantage because of its constant current principle and more constant stimulation effect.\r"

Both patients had herniated disc material at the L5 to S1 level on computed tomography (CT) scans corresponding to the side and level of their lesion on physical examination and electrodiagnostic testing. In both instances, the radiculopathy resolved with conservative treatment. CT scans were repeated in three months on one patient and four months on the other. The scans showed major resolution of the herniated disc material in both patients. These two cases demonstrate that in some patients with proven radiculopathy secondary to herniated nucleus pulposus, the herniated disc material will no longer be visible on CT scan and is presumed to resorb as the symptoms abate.\r"

We have treated nine patients with primary hyperparathyroidism associated with such double parathyroid gland enlargement. In four of these patients, marked asymmetry of the two enlarged glands was noted and the failure to recognize and excise a second enlarged parathyroid gland resulted in persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism. In one of these patients, the second enlargement was present in a super-numerary mediastinal gland. The subsequent excision of the second enlarged parathyroid gland resulted in normocalcemia in each instance. This contrasts with five patients in whom initial excision of two enlarged glands resulted in normocalcemia with no recurrence of hypercalcemia. Only three patients fulfilled the histologic criteria of true double adenomas. The remainder showed multiglandular hypercellularity. This experience supports identifying all parathyroid glands and recognizing that even minimal enlargement of a gland may be important pathophysiologically, regardless of its histopathologic classification. Excision of both enlarged glands, even if asymmetric, is appropriate.\r"

Thirty-eight patients (73%) underwent palliative procedures aimed at relieving the biliary obstruction (group A) and 14 patients (27%) were operated on with curative intent (group B). The choice of the surgical procedure employed to relieve the biliary obstruction did not significantly influence the length of survival of patients in group A in whom the median survival was 13.5 months and the in-hospital mortality was 15.7%. Fifty percent of the patients in group B underwent major liver resections to macroscopically encompass the tumor. In this group, although 35% of the patients experienced major complications, no in-hospital mortalities were encountered and the median actuarial survival was 38 months. The projected and crude 5-year survival rates were 28% and 21%, respectively. Age, gender, extent of resection, microscopic status of margins of resection, and grade of the lesion did not affect the length of survival in patients in group B. Locoregional failure, either isolated or as a component of peritoneal failure, was detected in the 6 patients in whom the disease has recurred. Eighty-three percent of the patients in whom the disease has recurred were dead within 12 months of the diagnosis of recurrence.

Culture results appeared to influence antibiotic therapy in only 7 patients (7%). The routine cultures obtained at appendectomy affected therapy in only 2 patients. Discriminant analysis identified postoperative infectious complications and related factors as the principal determinants of culture utility. We conclude that, in patients with perforated appendicitis treated empirically with aminoglycoside combination regimens, culture results were seldom used for clinical management except in instances of postoperative infectious complication. Routine cultures and Gram's stains of perforated appendicitis, however, should still be obtained (1) to allow epidemiologic tracking in the hospital; (2) to identify organisms that are recovered infrequently but may cause serious disease (eg, Clostridium); and (3) because newer antibiotics are replacing aminoglycosides in the treatment of perforated appendicitis.\r"

Seventy-six percent of the injuries occurred during surgery, and the median injury rate was 4.2 per 1000 operating room hours.

The diagnosis was difficult to make in two cases, even at laparotomy. Four patients underwent a biliary bypass, and two underwent a concomitant gastric or duodenal bypass. Two patients died postoperatively. Four patients responded well to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, and two did not have any recurrences at 3 and 7 years postoperatively. Although rare, lymphoma should be considered in patients with undiagnosed pancreatic masses. The diagnosis may only be made with appropriate preoperative or intraoperative suspicion, and treatment may be rewarding, particularly in comparison with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\r"

The hospital mortality, morbidity of treatment, mortality of treatment, and the percentage of treatment failure in group 1 were 20%, 40%, 6.7%, and 16.7%, respectively. Those in group 2 were 8%, 10%, 3.8%, and 10%, respectively. The modes of treatment for stone removal included surgery with postoperative cholangioscopy and percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy. There was a statistically significant difference between these two groups in the hospital mortality and the morbidity of treatment. We conclude that hepatolithiasis and biliary stricture should be treated early, before the development of secondary biliary cirrhosis. However, even after cirrhosis occurs, aggressive treatment does not increase the mortality of treatment or the treatment failure rate.\r"

The classic findings of fever, pruritus, maculopapular rash, and eosinophilia did not correlate with either the onset or the severity of the neutropenia. Neutropenia can develop precipitously. Prevention of neutropenia is difficult in a patient population receiving long-term antibiotic therapy. Regular monitoring of the white blood cell count and differential cell count minimizes the risk of developing prolonged, severe neutropenia with potential complications. No patient in this series had any serious or infectious complication secondary to neutropenia.\r"

Four patients had undergone cardiac studies in area hospitals, while three were studied elsewhere. The four A-V fistulas after 23,291 cardiac catheterization procedures in Dayton hospitals represented an incidence of 0.017% for this complication. Congestive heart failure and limb ischemia were the most frequent presenting symptoms that developed from two to ten months after catheterization. Intentional puncture of both the artery and vein of the ipsilateral groin for right- and left-sided heart studies was the probable cause of fistula formation in two cases. Five patients sustained inadvertent injury to both an artery and adjacent vein during percutaneous vascular access. Six A-V fistulas that involved femoral vessels were managed by division of the fistula with lateral repair of the artery and vein. An unusual communication between the right thyrocervical trunk and the internal jugular vein was handled by ligation of the affected vessels. Prompt surgical correction of this unusual complication of percutaneous vascular access is recommended as spontaneous closure is unlikely.\r"

In an effort to incorporate the advantages of vascularized tissue into aortic replacement, the practionally of infrarenal aortic replacement was investigated in dogs by a vascularized, musculofascial, pedicle graft. Eight dogs underwent laparotomy, and the left rectus abdominus muscle, its posterior rectus sheath, and underlying peritoneum were used to construct a tube graft based on the inferior epigastric vascular pedicle. A 2- to 4-cm section of the infrarenal aorta was resected, and the tube graft was interposed. Aortography documented graft patency immediately and at 1,6, and 10 months. Gross and histologic examination of the grafts at one month revealed viable skeletal muscle in the pedicle graft, with a thin layer of fibrin deposition on the luminal surface. Ten months after insertion, the microscopic examination against revealed patent vessels in the graft and a neoendothelial layer that lined the luminal surface of the graft. Successful replacement of the dog infrarenal aorta can be performed using a tube graft as part of a vascularized, musculofascial, pedicle flap. The potential for its use in the infected field is intriguing and deserves further study.\r"

  ".W": "To better define the risk of breast cancer in young patients, a retrospective review of all breast biopsies in women under age 40 years at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, from Dec 1, 1981, to Aug 15, 1987, was performed. During this time, 751 biopsies were performed on patients aged 9 to 40 years. None of the 128 patients aged 20 years or less had carcinoma. Of 150 patients aged 21 to 25 years, two had carcinoma. At age 26, there began a steady rise in the incidence of carcinoma, such that in the 36- to 40-year age group, carcinoma was present in 24.4% of the specimens. This retrospective review confirms previous reports that suggest that carcinoma of the breast is distinctly unusual in patients under age 20 and that breast masses in these young patients should be managed conservatively. As the incidence of carcinoma increases with the age of the patient, one's threshold for excisional biopsy should decrease.\r"

Injuries to viscera other than the colon during colonoscopy are rare, and the diagnosis is frequently delayed. Excessive traction on the splenocolic ligament or on preexisting adhesions, resulting in capsular tears, is the presumed mechanism of injury. Although computed tomography may be helpful, the greatest aid to an early diagnosis is the knowledge that this complication may occur.\r"

Cystogastrostomy, cystojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y loop, and, less frequently, cystoduodenostomy are the surgical techniques most commonly employed to attain effective internal drainage. We present the case of a patient with a pseudocyst arising from the cephalic portion of the pancreatic head and extending into the porta hepatis, causing obstructive jaundice, who was treated by cystocholedochostomy. This simple procedure was performed after an intraoperative cholangiogram showed no ductal obstruction distal to the pseudocyst. A cholecystectomy was also done, and the common bile duct was drained with a T tube. This expeditious procedure, rather than a Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy, was elected because of the firm adherence of the posterior wall of the common bile duct to the anterior surface of the pseudocyst. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and has been completely asymptomatic for 2 years. We believe this is the first report of a pancreatic cystocholedochostomy for a pancreatic pseudocyst.\r"

Several anecdotal case reports have documented various cardiac irregularities during seizures. We reviewed simultaneous 24-hour electroencephalographic - electrocardiographic studies obtained by ambulatory cassette electroencephalography in 45 patients who experienced 106 electrographic seizures. An increase in heart rate was seen in 96% of seizures, while in four seizures, the rate was unchanged. Heart rate increase measured from 1 minute preictally to intraictal peak ranged from 0% to 160% (mean, 60%). The onset of tachycardia was usually within several seconds (before or after) of the seizure onset, and often persisted for several minutes after termination of the discharge. No difference was found in patients with lateralized vs generalized seizures. Neither ventricular ectopia, conduction defects, or bradycardia were observed during the ictal episodes. We conclude that ictal tachycardia is the rule during electrographic seizures, and that high-risk cardiac arrhythmias are uncommon.\r"

The occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias was related to medical history of cardiovascular disease, but not to organic cerebral disorders. The ictal increase of heart rate was significantly higher and more abrupt in epileptic seizures than in psychogenic attacks. The ictal electroencephalogram/electrocardiogram may thus be applicable to the differential diagnosis between the epileptic and psychogenic seizures.\r"

Two-point discriminatory ability appeared to be relatively well-preserved and at least 25 of the 35 individuals were able to learn to read standard or jumbo braille. Individuals with abnormalities in two-point discrimination (greater than 5 mm) were found to have abnormalities in braille reading. Individuals with visual impairment due to diabetes should not be discouraged from undertaking braille on the basis of apparent polyneuropathy.\r"

The platelet content of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was equally reduced in both classic and common migraine. Platelet-dense bodies, the storage organelles for serotonin, were increased in both migraine groups, particularly in classic migraine. The results were interpreted as evidence for reduced platelet serotonin turnover combined with dense body hyposecretion in migraine sufferers. These findings are further supportive evidence for altered serotonergic function between attacks of migraine, and argue in favor of a role for serotonin in the mechanisms of a migraine attack.\r"

Patients with DAT were more impaired than patients with HD on the Memory subtest, whereas patients with HD were more impaired than patients with DAT on the initiation subtest.

Control studies carried out in the same group before the trial did not show any significant improvement. Five patients were controls and were treated only with symptomatic drugs. The total diameter of the lesions was reduced from 220.1 mm to 52.1 mm, which signifies a reduction of 76.3% in patients treated for a period of 3 days, and from 278.5 mm to 82.1 mm, which is 70.5%, in patients treated for 30 days.

The patient presented with flank pain, and computed tomography of the abdomen revealed multiple bilateral renal infarcts. An echocardiogram delineated a left ventricular thrombus and generalized hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%. Heparin therapy was started, but the patient died of refractory congestive heart failure. Autopsy revealed diffuse skeletal myopathy consistent with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy as well as biventricular cardiomyopathy with a recent left ventricular apical-septal mural thrombus. Right atrial thrombus, a left upper lobe pulmonary embolus, and splenic and renal infarcts were also noted. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of left ventricular thrombus with or without systemic emboli in the cardiomyopathy of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Two patients presented with painful unilateral oculomotor nerve palsies without evidence of ocular congestion or hypoxia. They were initially thought to have posterior communicating or distal internal carotid aneurysms, but had, in fact, dural-cavernous sinus shunts, draining posteriorly into the inferior petrosal sinus. One patient later developed a moderately severe congestive ophthalmopathy, and repeated selective carotid arteriograms showed that the shunt was now draining anteriorly into the superior ophthalmic vein. In the other patient, the oculomotor nerve palsy resolved without the development of any further signs. These observations support the concept that dural-cavernous sinus shunts produce symptoms that are dependent on the direction of drainage from the shunt. It is clear that the direction of drainage can change and that thrombosis of the posterior cavernous sinus determines the direction of drainage. The exact mechanism of the cranial neuropathy is, however, unknown.\r"

During the course of the study, the mean +/- SD difference in intraocular pressure between the timolol-treated and the placebo-treated eyes was 2.3 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. Reproducible visual field loss developed in 4 timolol-treated eyes and 10 placebo-treated eyes. Progressive optic disc cupping was noted in 4 timolol-treated and 8 placebo-treated eyes. Using a computerized image analysis system, the mean +/- SD increase in optic disc pallor during the course of the study was 0.86% +/- 2.4% in the timolol-treated eyes as opposed to 1.80% +/- 3.6% in the placebo-treated eyes.

Intraocular pressure decreased from the mean (+/- SD) initial intraocular pressure of 33.2 +/- 8.2 mm Hg to the final intraocular pressure of 16.9 +/- 6.1 mm Hg over 13.6 +/- 10.4 weeks.

The decrease of mean (+/- SD) cup volume from 0.592 +/- 0.966 to 0.451 +/- 0.703 mm3 was only marginally significant. However, more meaningful was a finding that reversal of cup volume, like reversals of cup-disc ratio and rim area, was directly proportional to the percent IOP reduction (r = .669 for cup volume reversal; r = .626 for cup-disc ratio reversal; and r = .675 for rim area reversal).\r"

Poor correlation was found between axial length and response to surgery in exotropic patients. We feel this poor correlation was due, in part, to the postoperative drift rate in exotropic patients as well as inaccuracies with the standard techniques used to determine the basic deviation on which surgery in exotropic patients is based.\r"

Measurements of total axial length indicated that complex microphthalmos was congenital and that postnatal growth of the malformed eye was similar to that of normal eyes. In most patients the anterior segment length was normal, while in all patients the posterior segment length was at least 2 SDs below the mean. Corneal diameter correlated significantly with total axial length (r2 = .57) and decreased linearly as total axial length decreased. In most patients in whom measurements were obtained, the lens and corneal power were increased, thereby compensating for decreased total axial length. We propose that inadequate production of secondary vitreous is the cause of the microphthalmos, given that the posterior segment was disproportionately reduced in size and the secondary vitreous is its predominant component. Evidence that each of the various ocular malformations can influence the production of secondary vitreous is presented.\r"

Twelve patients had associated systemic disorders, such as fetal alcohol syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and achondroplasia, which implicated decreased size of the optic cup, altered vitreous proteoglycans, low intraocular pressure, and abnormal release of growth factors in the pathogenesis of microphthalmos.\r"

Suprachoroidal effusion and hemorrhage may precede the development of expulsive hemorrhage; however, the relationship remains unclear. After sedation with intravenous pentobarbital sodium, 11 rabbits were given lactated Ringer's solution and heparin sodium intravenously. The right eyes were proptosed, and the central cornea, lens, and anterior vitreous were removed. After surgery, all 11 eyes (100%) developed choroidal effusion, choroidal hemorrhage, or expulsive hemorrhage. The rabbits were killed at various intervals after surgery so that the eyes could be enucleated and processed for light microscopy. Histologic examination revealed four sequential stages of expulsive hemorrhage as follows: (1) There was engorgement of the choriocapillaris. (2) Suprachoroidal effusion occurred mainly near the posterior pole. (3) As the effusion enlarged, stretching and tearing of choroidal vessels as well as tearing of the vessels and attachments at the base of the ciliary body occurred. (4) Massive extravasation of blood, primarily from the torn vessels at the ciliary body base, resulted in suprachoroidal hemorrhage and expulsion of blood through the surgical wound. This experimental model may provide new information relating to the cause and prevention of expulsive choroidal hemorrhage.\r"

The connections to the choroidal elastic tissue are in the form of bundles of microfibrils (in the rabbit) or elastin and microfibrils (in the human) that cross the tissue space between the choriocapillaris and join bundles of choroidal elastic tissue. These connections suggest that the elasticity of Bruch's membrane exerts its influence distant from the membrane itself. The connections onto the pars plana of the ciliary body implicate Bruch's membrane in disaccommodation when the ciliary muscle relaxes.\r"

Maximum corneal epithelial involvement was observed in each group on day 6 postinoculation, and in eyes subsequently treated with prednisolone, the corneal epithelial involvement appeared to be more severe and to resolve more slowly. Conjunctivitis and corneal clouding peaked on days 6 to 7 for all treatment groups and remained most severe in the placebo-treated eyes, followed closely by those treated with prednisolone. The duration of virus shedding was the same for placebo-, flurbiprofen-, and diclofenac-treated groups (50% or more were virus negative by day 10 or 11). Only prednisolone-treated eyes had an extended period of virus shedding, and the rabbit mortality rate in this group was slightly higher. It thus appears that topical diclofenac does not exacerbate acute herpes keratitis; diclofenac-treated eyes displayed less or at least no more severe disease than did the eyes treated with the other anti-inflammatory agents tested, and shedding of virus into tears was not prolonged.\r"

Activation of the classical pathway was monitored by analysis of C4a desArg levels and total C4 levels, and activation of the alternative pathway was monitored by isoelectric focusing/immunofixation and quantitative analyses of Factor B. Activation of C3 (a general measure of complement activation) was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for C3d and by quantitative analysis of C3. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: those with C4 but not C3 activation; those with C4 and C3 but not Factor B activation; and those with C4, C3, and Factor B activation. At the end of 2 years, there was a statistically significant difference in the morbidity and mortality rates of the third group of SLE patients compared with those in the other 2 groups. There was also a statistically significant association between the presence of Ba and cutaneous vasculitis. Unlike the patterns seen with in vitro-activated serum or with membrane-activated plasma, the Bb activation fragment was not present in the activated plasma samples from the SLE patients. These data suggest that activation of the alternative complement pathway may be a marker for severe SLE and that the Bb fragment may be playing a role in the development of this more serious pathologic condition.\r"

When the relative antibody concentration was quantified, increased quantities of antibody to Ro (SS-A) were also found in mothers of male probands and mothers of probands whose SLE was diagnosed before age 10. No similar association was found for the presence or amount of antibody to Ro (SS-A) in other first-degree relatives or for antibody to La (SS-B) or nuclear RNP in any relative. The explanation for the association of maternal anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies and early diagnosis of SLE or male sex is not apparent. These findings extend the association of maternal antibodies to Ro (SS-A) from transient \"neonatal\" SLE to SLE in childhood, and suggest that maternal antibodies to Ro (SS-A) may be of fundamental importance in the pathogenesis of some cases of childhood SLE.\r"

It has been shown that the presence of HLA-DR3 in mothers may facilitate Ro synthesis, but may not, by itself, be sufficient to induce CCHB in the offspring. However, maternal DR3 and Ro antibody seem to be independent factors associated with CCHB. Other HLA antigens, including class III (complement) genes, may also be necessary to induce CCHB in newborns since A1;B8; DR3 haplotypes, together with BfS and/or C4AQ0B1, are increased in Ro+ mothers of infants with CCHB compared with both controls and with Ro+ mothers whose offspring do not have CCHB. On the other hand, DR3 genes in a different HLA haplotype (i.e., B18; BfF1;DR3) are nonpathogenetic; this latter finding may be due to a DR3 gene's intrinsic difference or to the influence of neighboring genes. Also, a trend toward DR3 bias transmission is observed in DR3+ mothers who are also Ro+; fetal DR3 might protect the fetus against in utero death when Ro antibodies are present.\r"

Twenty patients had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 4 of whom also had vasculitis, 11 patients had rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 4 of whom also had vasculitis, and 5 patients had other types of vasculitis. There was no significant difference in alpha 2PI levels between the 3 patient groups and the control groups. However, plasma levels of alpha 2PIPC in all 3 patient groups were significantly higher than those in the control group. Moreover, plasma concentrations of alpha 2PIPC in SLE patients with vasculitis were statistically significantly higher than those in SLE patients without vasculitis. These concentrations were also higher in RA patients with vasculitis than in RA patients without vasculitis, although the difference was not statistically significant.

At later times after trauma (up to 4 years), many of these patients still had significantly elevated levels of cartilage PG fragments in the joint fluid. In a group of older patients with gonarthrosis, these levels were only moderately elevated, while in patients with acute pseudogout, greatly increased levels were observed.

Five patients were hypertensive (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mmHg) at some point during the study and there was a significant tachycardia. Over the first 4 days of abstinence there were falls in all of the measures reaching significance for renin, cortisol, systolic blood pressure and pulse. There were no correlations between blood pressure and any of the hormones measured although there was a significant association between pulse and both aldosterone and cortisol. It is concluded that the activity in the renin-angiotensin axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is not responsible for alcohol-related changes in blood pressure.\r"

These 34 heavy drinkers presented a mean serum mAST value which was significantly higher than that of the 269 normal drinkers; however, only 14 out of the 34 (41%) exhibited an increased mAST value. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive positive value of the mAST/tAST ratio were 0.29, 0.77 and 0.13, respectively; the corresponding figures for GGT were 0.5, 0.81 and 0.23, respectively. These results are in sharp contrast with those obtained for mAST activity in a population of hospitalized alcoholics. The explanation may lie in differences in alcohol consumption, in nutritional status and in the frequency of alcohol-related diseases in inpatients as compared to outpatients.\r"

  ".W": "Vagal neuropathy in chronic alcoholics seems more common than supposed and its reversibility and relationship with alcohol intake and nutritional status remain obscure. We embarked upon a study of a series of 70 chronic alcoholics in whom reliable alcoholism history, nutritional status evaluation and cardiovascular reflex tests were performed at the beginning of abstinence. Moreover, an electrophysiological study of peripheral nerves was carried out. Five out of 70 patients had symptoms related to autonomic neuropathy. Fourteen alcoholics presented abnormal indices in the deep breathing test (DBT) performed, including the five patients with clinical manifestations. A strong correlation between DBT indices and total lifetime ethanol intake and motor conduction velocity of lower limbs (MCV) was observed. No gross evidence of malnutrition was detected in the alcoholics and the transketolase erythrocyte activity was normal in all but one. Since the MCV also correlated with total lifetime ethanol intake, it appears that ethanol may exercise a dose-related toxic effect on both the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems. Finally, 12 of 14 patients with abnormal DBT index were re-evaluated one year later. Eleven who reported complete ethanol abstinence presented an improvement of this index and nine of them reached the normal range. Three of four patients with clinical manifestations reported an improvement of the symptoms. Thus, vagal neuropathy may reverse in most of the patients who manage to maintain ethanol abstinence.\r"

These are: concentration (amount per unit wet weight), absolute amount (total quantity per organ or tissue) or relative to body weight (total quantity per unit body weight). Specific reference is made to the amount of RNA in skeletal muscles from rats fed the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol for 6 weeks. Comparisons were made with data from rats which were pair-fed the same diet in which ethanol was substituted by iso-caloric glucose. Chronic ethanol-feeding had no statistically significant effect on the concentration of skeletal muscle RNA, though the absolute amount was reduced by 20%. When expressed relative to body weight the magnitude of this decline was reduced, to only 10%. Due to the nature of the liquid feeding regime the animals showed variable alterations in body weight. The amount of liquid diet consumed by control and ethanol-fed rats over a 24 hr period can comprise as much as 40% (w/w) of body weight. It is therefore suggested that data expressed relative to body mass may, on occasions, be erroneous. Episodic engorgement with food may also have an influence on other metabolic processes such as the kinetics of protein, fat or carbohydrate metabolism. These issues may have important implications for other studies using the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet to examine the effects of ethanol on muscle or non-muscle tissues.\r"

In addition to the heavy costs of these problems for industry, it is suggested that a further and generally ignored burden comes from the premature death in middle life of alcoholics who will include a disproportionately large number of top management and more skilled employees. A comparison with the history of alcohol-related road traffic accidents suggests that there is scope for large savings from an effective campaign to reduce the incidence of alcohol-related problems in the workplace. An outline is given of the managerial steps involved in setting up and running a company alcohol programme and North American and early U.K. experience is assessed to indicate the approaches most likely to lead to effective prevention. An analysis is attempted of the conditions needed for effectiveness and the reasons for the reported high success rate of many existing programmes. Background information is provided of the resources available to assist such a project, including specialist organizations, publications, videos and facilities for staff training.\r"

It was hypothesized that people who considered it appropriate to drink a given beverage type would drink more of that beverage than those individuals who deemed consumption of that type of alcohol to be inappropriate. Results indicated that this is valid for certain of the social occasions in terms of the use of beer, distilled spirits and wine. Wine cooler consumption, however, was found to be unrelated to people's perceptions of how appropriate it is to drink in different social situations.\r"

Tertatolol, a new non-selective beta-blocker, has demonstrated similar systemic effects to other conventional beta-blockers, but tertatolol produces increases in both renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. To evaluate the renal hemodynamic mechanism responsible for the increase in GFR, micropuncture experiments were performed in normal Munich-Wistar rats. Intravenous injection of tertatolol produced a significant increase in GFR and urinary sodium excretion in spite of a decrease in systemic blood pressure. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate was significantly increased due to an increase in single nephron plasma flow related to parallel afferent and efferent arteriolar dilatation. No significant changes in glomerular hydrostatic pressure, transcapillary hydrostatic pressure gradient or the ultrafiltration coefficient were demonstrated with tertatolol. The capacity of tertatolol to increase glomerular filtration rate and to promote sodium excretion without modifying critical glomerular pressures makes this agent a highly attractive antihypertensive drug.\r"

  ".W": "Tertatolol, a new beta-adrenergic blocker, increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF), and enhances diuresis and natriuresis in experimental animals and humans. The mechanism underlying the renal effects of tertatolol has not been established. In the present study we addressed the possibility that tertatolol influences renal function by a direct intrarenal mechanism. For this purpose we used a preparation of isolated rat kidney perfused with an artificial cell-free medium. Tertatolol when given as a bolus injection into the renal artery at the dose of 25 and 50 micrograms/kg, but not of 12.5 micrograms/kg, significantly enhanced the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and perfusate flow rate (PFR). In contrast, the intrarenal bolus injection of different doses of propranolol (100, 250, or 500 micrograms/kg) was unable to change GFR and PFR to a significant extent. While no change in urine flow rate was found when the lowest dose of tertatolol was used, the compound at the dose of 25 and 50 micrograms/kg progressively increased urine flow during the time of perfusion. A similar effect of tertatolol was observed for urinary sodium and potassium excretion. In contrast, different doses of propranolol did not significantly change the urine flow rate or sodium and potassium excretion rates. We conclude that tertatolol, but not propranolol, increases GFR and PFR, and enhances urine output and sodium excretion in the isolated perfused rat kidney. These findings indicate that tertatolol preserves renal function by a mechanism independent of systemic changes.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of tertatolol on renal circulation were studied in 8 patients with normal renal function. Left renal blood flow was measured by the continuous thermodilution method before (t0), and 5 (t1), 10 (t2) and 20 (t3) min after a selective infusion of 0.25 mg of tertatolol into the left renal artery. During the study, cardiac output, heart rate, aortic and right atrial pressures, systemic vascular resistances and the systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference were not significantly altered. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone in arterial and renal venous blood started to decrease at t1. At t3, renal blood flow was increased (from 463 +/- 28 mL/min at t0, to 549 +/- 22 mL/min, P less than .001), renal vascular resistance was reduced (from 188 +/- 17 mm Hg/L/min at t0 to 156 +/- 15 mm Hg/L/min, P less than .01) and the arteriovenous oxygen difference was decreased (from 1.6 +/- 0.2 mL/100 mL at t0 to 1.1 +/- 0.1 100 mL, P less than .01). The renal/cardiac flow ratio increased from 10.0 +/- 2.2% to 11.7 +/- 2.1% (P less than .05) and the renal/systemic vascular resistance ratio decreased from 10.5 +/- 2.0 to 8.7 +/- 1.4 (P less than .01). These data show that selective infusion of a low dose of tertatolol into the renal artery results in an increase in renal blood flow which is delayed and occurs without concomitant changes in systemic hemodynamics. This suggests an intrarenal mechanism of action in humans supporting the previously observed renal vasodilation induced by tertatolol in isolated perfused animal kidneys.\r"

Beta-adrenoceptors occur in the kidney at the level of the juxtaglomerular and tubular cells. Direct intrarenal effects of beta-blockers include the decrease in renin release and the enhanced tubular excretion of fluid and electrolytes. Beta-blockers also influence renal function in a more indirect way by altering the activity of different extrarenally formed hormones with an effect on fluid and electrolyte excretion, such as angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic factors and prostaglandins. Several beta-blockers have an additional effect on the renal vasculature. One of these, tertatolol, is a renal vasodilator beta-blocker in different species. The possible mechanisms of renal vasodilatation of tertatolol are reviewed. It is concluded that the shift of the renal pressure-diuresis curve is an essential feature in the mode of long-term antihypertensive action of beta-blockers.\r"

We provide evidence that tertatolol competitively inhibits beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) and induces a marked and persistent reduction of their number. This has been consistently found in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro study showed that the receptor reduction by tertatolol was rapid (about 1 h at 37 degrees C), slowly reversible and independent of ISA. This effect was also observed in vivo. In healthy volunteers, seven days tertatolol treatment lowered the number of beta-AR by 26%. This number gradually rose back to the pretreatment levels, and a significant effect was still present on day 3 after drug withdrawal. The reduction of heart rate by tertatolol was also persistent and was still significant on day 3 to 5 after drug withdrawal. We conclude that the reduction of the receptor numbers may be important in producing a lack of a rebound effect after discontinuation of chronic tertatolol treatment.\r"

A daily single dose of 5 mg tertatolol was administered orally for 4 weeks, except in the 72 h following the first administration. Plasma samples and urine collections were carried out over 72 h after the first (D0) and the last dose (D27). After the first administration, tertatolol was rapidly absorbed (time to peak concentration: 1.2 +/- 0.7 h) and peak concentration was 160 +/- 80 ng/mL. Plasma concentrations decreased following a biphasic curve, with two half-lives of 2.5 +/- 1.1 and 17.0 +/- 8.5 h, respectively. These parameters were not modified by repeated administration of tertatolol and did not significantly correlate with Clcr either at D0 or at D27. Plasma levels were stable along the study with similar areas under plasma curves following the first and the last dose (P = NS). In addition, plasma levels extrapolated from first dose data did not significantly differ from those observed during repeated dosage. Plasma levels of the 4-OH metabolite which possesses a beta-blocking activity were low, inconstantly detectable, not related to the degree of renal impairment, and no accumulation occurred after chronic dosage. Renal excretion of tertatolol and 4-OH tertatolol was significantly increased by repeated administration (P less than .01) and correlated well with Clcr either at D0 or at D27. Four week treatment was well tolerated and significantly improved Clcr (+6.5%, P less than .02). In conclusion, tertatolol was well tolerated and did not accumulate in patients with renal failure of various degrees. The usual daily single dose of 5 mg may be kept unchanged whatever the degree of renal impairment.\r"

Fifteen hypertensive patients were selected as good responders to previous treatment with tertatolol (supine blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg). They were divided into 2 groups: group 1 with LVH (n = 6) and group 2 without LVH (n = 9). After a one month wash-out period, all patients received 5 mg tertatolol once daily. In case of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), the dose was doubled after 2 weeks in 10 patients. BP control was obtained in all patients. M-mode echocardiography and Doppler-echocardiography were performed under controlled conditions after BP normalization and after 6 months of treatment. Long-term BP normalization significantly reduced left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in group 1 (from 137 +/- 3 to 121 +/- 3 g/m2, P less than .01), but not in group 2 (from 120 +/- 3 to 114 +/- 4 g/m2, P = NS). After 2 weeks of effective therapy, the ratio between early and late diastolic peak flow velocity across the mitral valve (E/A ratio), significantly increased in both groups (from 0.72 +/- 0.04 to 0.87 +/- 0.06 in group 1, P less than .05; and from 1.13 +/- 0.06 to 1.26 +/- 0.07 in group 2, P less than .05). After 6 months, together with the reduction of LVMI, a further increase of E/A ratio was only observed in group 1 (to 1.30 +/- 0.12, P less than .05). In conclusion: (1) LVH contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients since its reversal is able to improve diastolic filling, and (2) effective antihypertensive treatment with tertatolol improves diastolic function independently from its effect on LV mass.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerance of tertatolol and atenolol. Sixty-one ambulatory patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 120 mm Hg) received, following a randomized allocation, either 5 mg tertatolol (T) (n = 30) or 100 mg atenolol (A) (n = 31) in single daily dose. After a one-month single-blind placebo run-in period, the two drugs were administered double-blind over a 3 month period. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured before, and after the first and third months. Electrocardiographic and biological data were collected respectively before and at the third month. At each consultation, patients were asked to report any side effects. Atenolol and tertatolol were similar in controlling BP: the decrease in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) reached 24.2 mm Hg (P less than .001) in group T and 21.7 mm Hg in group A (P less than .001), and the decrease in DBP reached 16.6 mm Hg in group T (P less than .001) and 16.8 mm Hg in group A (P less than .001). Supine heart rate (HR) fell by 15.5 beats/min and 14.8 beats/min in the T and A groups, respectively (P less than .001). At the end of the trial, blood pressure control (DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) was obtained in 80% and 70% of the patients in the T and A groups, respectively. The clinical tolerance of both drugs was satisfactory with 8 slight and transient complaints in T group, and 14 complaints with one treatment-related withdrawal at the second month in A group. Electrocardiographic and biochemical variations were not significantly different in the two groups. We conclude that the antihypertensive efficacy of 5 mg tertatolol is comparable to that of 100 mg atenolol, with a similar clinical and biochemical tolerance.\r"

Other etiologic factors included mucormycosis following steroid therapy, Wegener's granulomatosis, nasal dermoid cyst and sinus tract, tooth abscesses, aspergillosis following chemotherapy for leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the frontal sinus, infected methylmethacrylate plate for a prior skull fracture, and a case of gauze packing left in the sinus following surgery. Anaerobic organisms were the predominant cause of the abscesses. The most dangerous intracranial complication was subdural abscess, which occurred in seven patients in this series. Three of them died. Four cases of frontal and parietal lobe abscesses were treated with systemic antibiotics only. This approach has not been well emphasized in our literature. Steroid therapy should not be used for the treatment of sinus and orbital infections. It can result in dreadful complications. The overall mortality rate in this series was 21% (4 of 19), despite aggressive treatment and close cooperation between the neurosurgeon, otolaryngologist, and other specialists. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are paramount.\r"

In 1983 and 1984, 50 patients were entered in the study. Prior to therapy all patients were evaluated by a representative from the Medical Oncology, Radiation Therapy, and Head and Neck Surgery Divisions, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City. In addition to the standard preoperative evaluation, pretreatment computed tomographic scans were performed on all patients. Follow-up computed tomographic scans were performed after the second cycle of chemotherapy and at the completion of treatment. Initial therapy in all patients consisted of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin (day 1, 100 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (days 1 through 5, 1000 mg/m2). Several factors were examined for their utility in predicting response to therapy and survival. Factors evaluated included: (1) extent and timing of chemotherapeutic response; (2) computed tomographic quantitated primary tumor size; (3) size of computed tomographic quantitated regional (neck) metastases; (4) performance status; (5) cancer stage; (6) total lymphocyte count; and (7) serum liver function tests. The factor found to be most useful in predicting improved survival was the extent of response to chemotherapy. The remaining factors, performance status, regional lymph node status, serum gamma-glutamyltransferase levels, and cancer stage, were also found to correlate with length of survival but were much less important than the response to chemotherapy.\r"

There are a wide range of methods that have been advocated to assist in this surveillance. However, at this time, there is no one technique that is universally efficacious in detecting early arterial and venous occlusion. In our experience, the most reliable means of monitoring has been the clinical assessment of flap color, capillary refill, tissue turgor, and bleeding. To assess these parameters, a portion of the flap must be accessible for observation. When the defect is buried, as is often the case in head and neck reconstruction, flap design is critical to achieve a reliable external segment for monitoring. The methods for exteriorizing a well-vascularized portion of tissue in the most commonly used flaps are described.\r"

A 4-year experience is presented with an emphasis on these areas. Eight hundred fifty grafts were placed in the face on 170 patients during this study period. A subgroup consisting of the nasal region was selected for a detailed analysis, since this complex could be readily evaluated, and the results have paralleled the remaining group. Although partial resorption is seen at most sites, ranging from insignificant to 30%, excellent contour has been achieved throughout the face and maintained in all but a few cases. The areas of maximum resorption and contour change were seen at the nasal dorsum and lateral posterior mandible.\r"

Previous reports describe the condition of patients with obstructive sleep apnea that developed after neck irradiation and secondary to supraglottic edema. Our patient had an obstructive component to his apnea similar to that described in previous cases, but, in addition, he had hypothyroidism. Myxedema is a well-described cause of both obstructive and central apnea. We believe both contributed to his condition. He was successfully treated by placement of a tracheostomy and by thyroid supplementation. In patients who present with sleep apnea after neck irradiation, especially with acute or severe symptoms, the differential diagnosis should include both a central cause from hypothyroidism as well as a peripheral obstructive cause from laryngeal edema.\r"

This was done before the commencement of hyperbaric oxygenation, while the necrotizing infection was still active. Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy was followed by complete resolution of the necrotizing otitis externa, which did not recur. The pathogenesis of the disease and mechanisms by which hyperbaric oxygenation might be of benefit are described. We conclude that hyperbaric oxygenation should be considered as adjuvant therapy for necrotizing otitis externa whenever a therapeutic pressure chamber is available.\r"
