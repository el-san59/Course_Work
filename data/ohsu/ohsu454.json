  ".W": "Although the human immunodeficiency virus can induce cytopathic changes in human lymphocytes in vitro, the mechanism(s) underlying progressive lymphopenia in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex has not been elucidated. To investigate this issue, peripheral blood lymphocytes of AIDS and AIDS-related complex patients and healthy control subjects were examined for their ability to resist homologous complement-mediated lysis. Upon sensitization with monoclonal antibodies to major histocompatibility complex class I antigen, as much as 48% lysis of patients' cells was observed in as little as a 1:32 dilution of human serum compared to 18 +/- 8% (mean +/- SD) lysis of controls' cells even in a 1:8 dilution of human serum. To investigate the mechanism of the abnormal complement sensitivity, AIDS and AIDS-related complex cells were analyzed for expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a complement regulatory protein that functions intrinsically in blood cell membranes to prevent complement activation on their surfaces. Flow cytometric assays using anti-DAF monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that patients' lymphocytes and monocytes were DAF-deficient, in contrast to their polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which showed normal DAF levels. Expression of DAF was diminished on CD4+ as well as CD8+ T-lymphocyte subpopulations as opposed to expression of CD3, which was comparable in patients and controls. Incubation of normal lymphocytes with anti-DAF monoclonal antibodies or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, an enzyme that cleaves DAF, enhanced lysis. Conversely, reconstitution of patients' cells with exogenous DAF reduced their lysis. The findings of heightened complement sensitivity and DAF deficiency of patients' lymphocytes in vitro suggest the possibility that the DAF deficit may contribute to the progressive lymphopenia of AIDS in vivo.\r"

In (NZB x NZB)F1 mice, increased percentages and increased absolute numbers of Ly-1+ B lymphocytes in spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, thymus, and bone marrow as revealed by two-color immunofluorescence analysis were greatly reduced by CEIR with a diet high in carbohydrate and low in fat. This influence on a possibly crucial lymphocyte subpopulation was associated with delayed onset of disease and with greatly prolonged life-span. In the present investigation, the percentages and absolute number of Ly-1+ B lymphocytes in the spleen, peritoneal exudate, and peripheral blood were found to be increased in each autoimmunity-prone strain studied. CEIR decreased the absolute and relative numbers of the Ly-1+ B lymphocytes in mice of each of the autoimmunity-prone strains and returned the number and proportions of Ly-1+ B cells close to levels present in the same locations in genetically long-lived C57BL/6, DBA/2, or BALB/c mice fed a standard commercial diet ad libitum.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages and B cells process antigens to produce antigenic peptides that associate with class II major histocompatibility complex molecules (e.g., Ia molecules); these Ia-peptide complexes are recognized by CD4+ T lymphocytes. Processing of the antigen hen egg white lysozyme was inhibited by cycloheximide in peritoneal exudate cells (PECs, largely macrophages), but not in TA3 B-lymphoma cells. The uptake and metabolism of hen egg white lysozyme was largely intact in cycloheximide-treated PECs, implicating a blockade in other steps in the formation of Ia-peptide complexes. Turnover of Ia-peptide complexes was markedly enhanced in viable antigen-presenting cells (TA3 and PEC) as compared to such complexes studied on fixed cells or in isolated preparations of Ia and peptide. In B cells the half-life of Ia-peptide complexes was much shorter than the half-life of the Ia molecules, implying turnover of Ia-peptide complexes by dissociatin and peptide exchange. In PECs, the dissociation of Ia-peptide complexes was more limited; the enhanced Ia-peptide turnover in viable PECs reflected in part biosynthetic turnover of Ia molecules. Specific mechanisms may exist in TA3 cells to facilitate exchange of peptides bound to Ia, allowing recycling of Ia to present another antigenic peptide; such Ia recycling would explain the ability of these cells to process and present antigen in the absence of Ia synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a T-cell derived lymphokine with multiple activities on a variety of cells. An intriguing feature of the different IL-4-mediated activities is their requirements for markedly different concentrations of IL-4 even on the same cell population. To gain some insight into the phenomenon, we have analyzed the structure of IL-4-binding proteins on T and B cells by cross-linking different concentrations of 125I-labeled IL-4 (125I-IL-4) to cells. Cross-linking of 125I-IL-4 at relatively low concentrations in the presence of the cross-linking agent 3,3'-dithiobis(propionic acid hydroxysuccinimide ester) resulted in the detection of the previously described 60- to 75-kDa protein. At higher 125I-IL-4 concentrations, however, an additional molecule of 105 kDa was observed. Cross-linking of 125I-IL-4 to both molecules was specific; it was inhibited by the presence of a 50-fold excess of either unlabeled IL-4 or monoclonal anti-IL-4 antibody. Furthermore, considerable size heterogeneity of the IL-4-binding proteins was evident in different cell populations. These results suggest that IL-4 receptors might have a more complex structure than originally reported and/or that high concentrations of IL-4 might induce interactions of the previously described IL-4 receptor (60-75 kDa) with a 105-kDa molecule. Hence, it is possible that IL-4 might generate a different signal at high concentrations through interaction of its receptor with another membrane molecule.\r"

We were interested in determining whether IL-2 could function as an adjuvant to vaccination, to increase the immune response to vaccine immunogens. Using the National Institutes of Health test for rabies vaccine potency, we found that daily systemic administration of IL-2 in conjunction with inactivated rabies virus can increase the potency of vaccination in outbred mice at least 25-fold, as measured by survival following challenge with virulent rabies virus. Enhanced protection is not correlated with an increase in virus-neutralizing antibody titers, and we suggest that IL-2 acts to increase the cellular immune response to vaccination.\r"

This analysis revealed that the tumors segregating in different lymphoid organs in 10% of the animals were clonally unrelated. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the MoMuLV-induced rat thymic lymphomas are polyclonal in origin. At least two factors may be responsible for this phenomenon: (i) increase in the number of the available target cells in virus-infected animals, and (ii) genetic instability associated with provirus integration in the developing premalignant clones.\r"

This infection of human fibroblastoid cells did not involve the CD4 molecule and did not have the properties of endocytosis. Human sera could be distinguished by their ability to neutralize HIV infection of the fibroblastoid versus human T-cell lines. These observations demonstrate further that other mechanisms for viral entry, besides CD4 binding, must be considered for HIV. They also indicate the wide cellular host range and heterogeneity of HIV strains. The possibility that fibroblastoid cells serve as a reservoir for the AIDS virus and are involved in connective tissue disorders of infected individuals merits attention.\r"

Stress increased both CRF and preproenkephalin mRNAs, whereas adrenalectomy increased only CRF mRNA. After adrenalectomy, even when CRF mRNA had reached peak levels, stress still further increased CRF mRNA and caused an exaggerated rise in preproenkephalin mRNA. Dexamethasone administration in the fast or intermediate-feedback time domains had no effect on CRF or preproenkephalin mRNA responses to stress; however, when administered over a longer period of time in the slow-feedback time domain dexamethasone reduced basal CRF mRNA levels and the stress-stimulated levels of CRF and preproenkephalin mRNA. These results show that different stimuli to the parvocellular paraventricular hypothalamus differentially regulate CRF transcript levels. Furthermore, in spite of the lack of any detectable effect of changes in circulating glucocorticoid levels on basal levels of preproenkephalin mRNA, glucocorticoids markedly alter the preproenkephalin mRNA response to stress.\r"

In major-mismatched allografts (Brown Norway to Fischer, n = 35), the articular cartilage of cyclosporine-treated animals maintained normal architecture and cell viability 52 weeks after operation despite the gross appearance of skin rejection, while that of non-cyclosporine-treated animals was degenerated and destroyed by 6 weeks.

The right IMA was preferably inserted into LAD and the left into diagonal or obtuse marginal coronary artery. Excessive postoperative bleeding was the only major complication attributable to bilateral IMA grafting in the 97 survivors of surgery. In routine revascularization the procedure involved minimal morbidity and no mortality. The superiority of the IMA as regards long-term patency is widely recognized. Since many thrombosed vein grafts will require replacement, we believe that bilateral IMA grafting will become common, and it is also an option when no suitable vein is available.\r"

Evidence has suggested that SED may result from structural defects in type II collagen. To confirm the validity of this hypothesis, the structure of the \"candidate\" type II collagen gene (COL2A1) has been directly examined in a relatively large SED family. Coarse scanning of the gene by Southern blot hybridization identified an abnormal restriction pattern in one of the affected members of the kindred. Analysis of selected genomic fragments, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, precisely localized the molecular defect and demonstrated that all affected family members carried the same heterozygous single-exon deletion. As a consequence of the mutation, nearly 90 percent of the assembled type II collagen homotrimers are expected to contain one or more procollagen subunits harboring an interstitial deletion of 36 amino acids in the triple helical domain.\r"

Brefeldin A, a specific inhibitor of exocytosis, completely and reversibly inhibited the presentation of viral proteins, but not exogenous peptides, to MHC class I-restricted CTLs directed against influenza virus antigens. The effect of brefeldin A on antigen presentation correlated with its inhibition of intracellular transport of newly synthesized class I molecules. Brefeldin A is thus a specific inhibitor of antigen processing for class I-restricted T cell recognition. Its effect on antigen presentation supports the idea that exogenous peptide antigens associate with cell surface class I molecules, whereas protein antigens processed via the cytosolic route associate with nascent class I molecules before they leave the trans-Golgi complex.\r"

Partial complementary DNAs coding for GP330 were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence from 4.3 kilobases of complementary DNA contains the sequences identical to two peptides derived from the isolated glycoprotein. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein contains regions with homology to the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, an indication that GP330 and the LDL receptor may be members of the same gene family. Autoantibodies from the kidneys of rats with Heymann nephritis reacted with a nonglycosylated segment of GP330 that contains cysteine-rich 40-amino acid repeats, which are also features of the LDL receptor. GP330 is also similar in some regions to the mouse epidermal growth factor precursor.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence indicates that metabolism of elastin may be altered in patients with different types of infrarenal aortic disease and that the phenotypic expression of aortic disease may be dependent on the balance between aortic elastase and antiprotease activity. The dipeptide L-valyl proline (LVP) is a specific amino acid sequence for elastin and can be quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the urine. This study was done to determine if alterations in systemic elastin metabolism could be detected in patients with different types of infrarenal aortic disease by quantitating urinary LVP. Patients were divided into one of five groups and had urine analyzed for LVP. These are control, no known aortic disease (n = 12); occlusive aortic disease (n = 10); elective abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) (n = 26); ruptured AAA (n = 5), and multiple aneurysms (n = 4). Urine values were correlated with aortic elastase and aortic antiprotease activity. Urinary LVP was significantly higher in patients with multiple aneurysms (1,209 micrograms per milliliter of urine) as compared with all of the other groups. Patients with elective AAA had significantly higher urinary LVP (40.5 micrograms per milliliter of urine) than patients with occlusive disease (9.1 micrograms per milliliter of urine) and those in the control group (4.2 micrograms per milliliter of urine). Patients with ruptured AAA did not have significantly elevated urinary LVP compared with other groups (18.6 micrograms per milliliter of urine). Urinary LVP increased significantly as aortic elastase and aortic elastase and antiprotease activity increased. These data suggest that elastin metabolism, as reflected by urinary LVP, is altered in patients with aortic aneurysmal disease and provide further evidence to support the concept that systemic elastin metabolism is altered in patients with different types of infrarenal aortic pathologic findings.\r"

  ".W": "Impaired wound healing remains an important clinical problem. Treatment with systemic Adriamycin (doxorubicin) is known to impair wound healing in patients, and it has been used to produce animal models of impaired healing. The results of previous studies have shown that local treatment of incisions in normal rats with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated early increases in tensile strength of surgical incisions in normal rats. We investigated the effects of locally applied, biosynthetic TGF-beta or EGF on the tensile strength of standardized incisions in rats treated with Adriamycin. Systemic Adriamycin treatment (8 milligrams per kilogram) produced significant decreases in wound tear strength (WTS) and wound tear energy (WTE) when compared with that of normal rats at seven and ten days (p less than 0.01). A single dose of TGF-beta (2 micrograms) in a collagen vehicle stimulated a reversal of this wound healing impairment at ten days (p less than 0.05), returning the WTS and WTE to near normal levels. A single dose of EGF (50 micrograms) in hyaluronic acid failed to increase tensile strength, probably because of formulation of EGF in a vehicle that does not prolong its release in incisions. These results suggest that exogenous growth factors may be clinically useful in stimulating healing in incisions in healing impaired conditions.\r"

  ".W": "In order to understand the role of T cells in postinjury fibroplasia, we have studied wound healing in congenitally athymic nude mice that lack a normally developed T cell system. Healing of incisional wounds, as assessed by wound breaking strength, was significantly stronger in nude mice compared with normal thymus-bearing animals. This was accompanied by a marked increase in the amount of reparative collagen synthesized at the wound site, as assessed by the hydroxyproline content of subcutaneously implanted sponges. Because nude mice have some extrathymic T cell maturation, we used an anti-Thy-1.2 (30H12) monoclonal antibody to selectively deplete T cells in vivo. Although such treatments impaired wound healing in normal mice, they had no effect on any wound healing parameter in nude mice. In a separate experiment, T cell reconstitution of nude mice, sufficient to significantly enhance in vivo delayed hypersensitivity responses, led to a decrease in both wound breaking strength and hydroxyproline deposition in subcutaneously implanted polyvinyl sponges. The data suggest that T cells play a dual role in wound healing: an early stimulatory role on macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, and a late counterregulatory role, which may be responsible for the orderly completion of wound repair.\r"

ST segment deviation from baseline, trended every 15 seconds, was quantified for duration, maximum ST segment change, area under the ST segment-time curve (AUC), and average ST segment change for the episode (AUC/duration). Ischemic episodes, 87% of which were silent, occurred in 42% of the patients. Symptomatic episodes had greater maximum ST segment change than silent episodes (-2.4 vs -1.9 mm; p less than 0.05) but were shorter in duration (11 vs 18 minutes; p less than 0.05). Episodes that were unrelated to heart rate, that is, episodes with less than 20% increase in heart rate over the baseline rate at the onset of ischemia, made up 75% of all ischemic events and occurred in 90% of patients (19 of 21). Heart rate-related and unrelated ischemic episodes did not differ in duration, maximum ST segment change, AUC, or average ST segment change. It was concluded that: (1) as with patients with unstable angina, patients with severe coronary artery disease continue to have frequent episodes of silent myocardial ischemia despite intensive medical therapy; (2) painful episodes have greater maximum ST segment change but are shorter than silent ones; (3) most ischemic episodes (75%) occur without an initial increase in heart rate; and (4) heart rate-related and unrelated episodes are quantitatively similar.\r"

This infection evokes myocarditis. The inflammatory and necrotic lesions in the ventricular myocardium 7 days after the inoculation covered 4.32% of the tissue section area in the nonexercised group. Exercise at 0 hours did not affect this myocardial damage (4.77%), whereas exercise at 48 hours after the inoculation increased the lesion to 7.85% (p less than 0.05). Lethality was not influenced by exercise. The response pattern of myocardial lymphocyte subpopulations was studied with an immune histochemical staining technique. The number of T cytotoxic, T suppressor cells increased threefold (p less than 0.01), and the T cytotoxic, suppressor/T helper cell ratio increased twofold (p less than 0.01) with exercise at 48 hours but was unchanged with exercise at 0 hours. The number of class II expressing cells decreased with exercise at 48 hours (p less than 0.05) and was negatively correlated (p less than 0.01) with the size of the inflammatory reaction. The development of myocardial inflammatory and necrotic lesions seems to be dependent on the presence and cooperation of class II expressing cells and T killer cells. Furthermore, failure to restrict physical activity in the acute phase of this infection may well contribute to the progression of the disease.\r"

Because of a broad variety of histologic features, the growth pattern of the tumor cells was subclassified into the following four subtypes: capillary, sinusoidal, cavernous, and myxomatous parts. The solitary tumor from patients 1 and 2 was composed of these four components, but the multiple tumor in the patient 3 consisted of capillary and sinusoidal parts. Immunohistochemically, vWF and vimentin were dominantly expressed in the ECs of the cavernous and myxomatous parts. UEA I had strongly positive results in all histologic types, except the myxomatous part. Expression of vWF and vimentin in neoplastic EC suggests that functional differentiation of the tumor tissue occurs in the myxomatous and cavernous parts and may be related to the spontaneous regression of the infantile hemangioendothelioma.\r"

  ".W": "A deficiency of the plasma protease inhibitor alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT), is usually associated with the deficiency allele PI*Z. However, other alleles can also produce a deficiency. Some of these rare deficiency alleles produce a low concentration (3%-15% of normal) of alpha 1AT and include Mmalton, Mduarte, Mheerlen, and Mprocida. Null, or nonproducing, alleles are associated with trace amounts (less than 1%) of plasma alpha 1AT. We have identified, using isoelectric focusing, the deficiency alleles in 222 patients (68 children and 154 adults) with alpha 1AT deficiency. In addition to PI*Z, we found low-producing alleles PI*Mmalton and PI*Mcobalt and four null (PI*QO) alleles. On the basis of a population frequency of .0122 for PI*Z, frequencies for other deficiency alleles are 1.1 x 10(-4) for PI*Mmalton, 2.5 x 10(-5) for PI*Mcobalt (which may be the same as that for PI*Mduarte, and 1.4 x 10(-4) for all null alleles combined. Using 12 polymorphic restriction sites with seven different restriction enzymes, we have obtained DNA haplotypes for each of the rare deficiency types. All of the rare deficiency alleles can be distinguished from PI*Z by their DNA haplotype, and most can be distinguished from each other. DNA haplotypes are useful to indicate the presence of new types of null alleles, to identify genetic compounds for rare deficiency alleles, and to identify the original normal allele from which each deficiency allele is derived.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified and/or characterized at least nine RFLPs at the adenosine deaminase (ADA) locus, detected by digestion of DNA with MspI, BanII, PstI, BalI, and PvuII. The RFLPs were distributed over approximately 15 kb of the gene, from IVS 2 to IVS 10. They exhibited Mendelian inheritance and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For seven fully characterized RFLPs, the gene frequencies of the rare alleles in 90 chromosomes examined ranged from .33 to .04, the PIC from .34 to .07, and the heterozygosity from .09 to .58. In kindreds examined (58 independent chromosomes), a total of nine haplotypes could be defined on the basis of seven fully characterized RFLPs with a heterozygosity of .62 and PIC of .53. Because there was considerable linkage disequilibrium, only three haplotypes accounted for 90% of individuals. Similar heterozygosity and PIC values (.59 and .51, respectively) could be obtained on the basis of haplotypes defined by the two sites that were the most polymorphic and that were in the least degree of linkage disequilibrium. A strategy for use of the RFLPs in linkage studies is suggested. We have also examined DNA from 17 patients with complete genetic deficiency of ADA (resulting in severe combined immunodeficiency [ADA-SCID] and from 10 patients with partial ADA deficiency (deficient in erythrocytes, with varying levels of ADA in other cells and normal immune function). Although the RFLPs detected genetic compounds among both types of patients, there was, as expected, a decreased incidence of heterozygosity (ADA-SCIDs, .29; partial ADA deficients, .20). Two additional haplotypes not found in the normal population were identified in homozygous form in patients. This information should be useful in developing a rational approach to delineation of mutations at the ADA locus as well as in distinguishing recurrent mutations of independent origin from those derived from a common progenitor.\r"

The previous localization of CEA-related genes to human chromosome 19, and the high level of DNA sequence conservation in the CEA family, suggested that the PS beta G genes are also located on this chromosome. We demonstrate here that chromosome 19 is indeed the site of PS beta G sequences. Our finding is in contrast to the recently reported indication that pregnancy-specific glycoproteins are encoded in chromosomes X and 6.\r"

  ".W": "A deficiency of the plasma protease inhibitor alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) is usually a consequence of the PI*Z allele. Mmalton is another deficiency allele which, like Z alpha 1AT, is associated with hepatocyte inclusions and impaired secretion. We report here the sequence of the PI Mmalton allele, which contains a 3-bp deletion coding for one of two adjacent phenylalanine residues (amino acid 51 or 52 of the mature protein). Using oligonucleotide hybridization of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA, we have demonstrated cosegregation of the PI Mmalton protein and the 3-bp deletion in the family in which this allele was originally described and in three other, unrelated kindreds. This deletion is found exclusively in PI Mmalton alleles and not in the normal M2 alleles from which, to judge on the basis of haplotype data, the Mmalton mutation must have been derived. In polyacrylamide isoelectric focusing (PIEF) gels, the isoelectric point of Mmalton is only slightly more cathodal than M2, a finding consistent with the loss of a single uncharged amino acid. To judge on the basis of X-ray crystallography data for the normal alpha 1AT protein, the deletion of aa 51/52 would shorten one strand of the beta sheet, B6, apparently preventing normal processing and secretion.\r"

Because interleukin-1 is capable of stimulating prostaglandin production by intrauterine tissues and is an inflammatory mediator, we propose that interleukin-1 may act as a signal for the onset of human labor in the setting of intrauterine infection. The purpose of these studies was to determine interleukin-1 activity in amniotic fluid and to establish its relationship with the onset of term and preterm labor. Amniotic fluid from 182 patients was assayed for interleukin-1 activity. Cell-associated interleukin-1 activity was detected in fluid obtained in the third trimester but not in fluid obtained in the second trimester of pregnancy, suggesting a maturational event in interleukin-1 production. The factor responsible for interleukin-1 activity had biochemical characteristics of interleukin-1 alpha (estimated molecular weight of 14 kilodaltons, isoelectric point = 4.9), and its activity was blocked with an anti-interleukin-1 alpha antisera. Women in spontaneous labor at term were likely to have fluid phase interleukin-1 activity in amniotic fluid than women who were not in labor at term. Preterm labor in the setting of intraamniotic infections was associated with significant interleukin-1 activity in amniotic fluid. This bioactivity was predominantly attributable to interleukin-1 beta. A strong correlation between interleukin-1 and amniotic fluid concentrations of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha was found in women in preterm labor. These findings support the hypothesis that interleukin-1 may play a role in the initiation of preterm labor associated with intraamniotic infection.\r"

Although the ratio of waist to hip (WHR) circumferences has been consistently related to diabetes mellitus, it is possible that only two measures do not completely characterize fat topography. The current study, therefore, examines the cross-sectional relation of six girths (waist, hip, neck, bust, wrist, and ankle) to diabetes mellitus in 43,595 women. As compared with non-diabetics, Quetelet index (kg/m2) and all circumferences were elevated among diabetics. Stratified analyses showed that WHR, and waist, neck, and bust girths were consistently related to diabetes independently of the degree of overweight. As estimated from a logistic regression model that simultaneously controlled for age and all anthropometric variables, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was positively related to Quetelet index, and to the waist, bust, and neck girths, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.4 to 2.6. However, diabetes was inversely related to hip (OR = 0.61) and ankle (OR = 0.73) girths; p less than 0.005 for each association. Although cross-sectional in nature, these results suggest that an adverse body fat distribution is not limited to the abdominal region, but that a relative preponderance of adipose tissue in various regions of the upper body is associated with diabetes mellitus in women.\r"

Natives were particularly at higher risk for ESRD to diabetes, glomerulonephritis, and pyelonephritis, whereas for the other causes the risk was no different from that of other Canadians. As technologically sophisticated treatment facilities are only available in major urban centers, Native ESRD patients and their families living in remote areas of Canada are faced with major psychosocial disruptions of relocation.\r"

Differences due to variable cause could not be found. There was a striking correlation between the preoperative values of these three parameters and the postoperative course of the patients. Additionally, there was a significant enhancement of an endothelial proliferation-inhibiting capacity in the serums of the lethal group, whereas endotoxin could only be detected in trace amounts in four patients with intraabdominal infection in the preoperative period.\r"

In the present study, we investigated 18 patients with HAM: five HTLV-I carriers without myelopathy and 13 normal control subjects seronegative for HTLV-I to determine if soluble IL-2 receptors (IL-2R), a marker of lymphocyte activation, were increased in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from HAM patients. Serum IL-2R levels were significantly increased in patients with HAM as compared to normal control subjects (HAM versus control subjects: 633 +/- 395 versus 278 +/- 53 U/ml, p less than 0.01). There was also an increase of serum IL-2R levels in one of five HTLV-I carriers. BAL levels of soluble IL-2R were low but detectable in four normal control subjects and in one HTLV-I carrier. In HAM patients, however, soluble IL-2R levels in BAL fluid were remarkably elevated (173 +/- 110 U/mg of albumin) and were nearly 13 times higher on average than in serum (BAL fluid/serum ratio: 13 +/- 10). In patients with HAM, lavage IL-2R levels correlated well with the number of T lymphocytes (CD3+ cells) and CD4+ cells in BAL fluid (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, BAL lymphocytes obtained from HAM patients synthesized DNA spontaneously when cultured in vitro. These results suggest that, in HAM, T lymphocytes increased in the lung are activated locally to produce soluble IL-2R. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that immunologic mechanism(s) may play an important role in the development of pulmonary lesions in HAM patients.\r"

In 60 patients with PCP, 15 fatalities or episodes of respiratory failure occurred, and 14 of these patients had greater than 5% BAL neutrophils. Only one of 33 patients with PCP and less than 5% BAL neutrophils died. In contrast, there was no correlation between survival and BAL neutrophil percentages in 33 patients who did not have PCP. Three patients with HIV infection without lung disease had normal BAL cell differentials. Intra-alveolar and interstitial leukocytes found in 17 transbronchial lung biopsies in patients with PCP indicate that the alveolar and interstitial compartments of the lung may be the source of BAL neutrophils. Pathologic evidence of increased severity of diffuse alveolar damage to explain BAL neutrophilia was not found. As BAL neutrophil percentages in PCP had both positive and negative predictive value, this information may be useful to stratify therapeutic trials or to identify the patient with PCP who is at high risk of a complicated or fatal outcome.\r"

As interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells lyse many solid tissue malignancies that are unresponsive to conventional forms of therapy, the aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of human malignant mesothelioma cells to lysis by natural killer (NK) and LAK cells. Using a 4-h 51Cr release assay, malignant mesothelioma cell lines grown from six different patients were found to be resistant to NK cell lysis (less than 10% lysis as compared to 50 +/- 3% lysis of the standard NK-sensitive target, K562, p less than 0.001). These malignant mesothelioma cells were, however, susceptible to lysis by LAK cells (58 +/- 4% lysis, p less than 0.001 compared to NK lysis). Similar results were seen using fresh mesothelioma cell targets (4 +/- 2% and 34 +/- 12% lysis for NK and LAK cells, respectively). Optimal LAK cell activation against these targets was achieved by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (2 to 4 x 10(6)/ml) in culture medium containing 1,000 units/ml IL-2 for 3 to 14 days. The degree of LAK cell activation was dependent on the serum source used in culture, with autologous serum being more effective than pooled human AB serum or fetal calf serum at generating LAK cell activity in vitro (p less than 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that although human malignant mesothelioma cells are resistant to NK cell lysis, IL-2-activated LAK cells effectively kill these targets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study population consisted of 282 subjects 20 to 69 yr of age, including 108 smokers and 174 nonsmokers. Multivariate analysis techniques were used to assess the influence of cigarette smoking status after controlling for the effects of age and gender. Cigarette smoking was associated with a nonspecific increase in the leukocyte count involving all major cell types (smokers: 8.50 +/- 0.15 versus nonsmokers: 7.33 +/- 0.12 cells/mm3; p less than or equal to 0.0001). In addition, cigarette smokers had a selective increase in CD4+ cells (helper-inducer T cells) compared with nonsmokers (55.3 +/- 0.8 versus 52.2 +/- 0.6% of lymphoid cells; p = 0.002), resulting in a statistically significant increase in the CD4+/CD8+ (helper/suppressor) ratio (2.42 +/- 0.1 versus 2.13 +/- 0.16; p = 0.02).

In our clinical practice, we have observed that patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) commonly had P-V curves with reduced maximal elastic recoil that are difficult to classify according to the classic description of the P-V curve in emphysema. In order to study the variability of P-V curves, we studied 39 cigarette smokers attending a pulmonary clinic (age, 61 +/- 1 yr; smoking history, 45 +/- 3 pack-years; mean +/- SEM) and compared them with 20 patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) (age, 41 +/- 2 yr; 13 smokers with a smoking history of 17 +/- 2 pack-years, and seven nonsmokers). Subjects underwent spirometry, lung volume, and diffusing capacity measurements as well as static deflation P-V curves. To characterize the P-V curves, we used transpulmonary pressure at 90% of TLC (PL90) as a measure of overall recoil and specific compliance (Csp) as a measure of the slope of the initial part of the P-V curve. The curves of non-AATD smokers were classified into three groups: 13 had PL90 greater than or equal to 80% predicted (Group I), 13 had PL90 less than 80% predicted and Csp greater than or equal to 0.08 (Group II), and 13 had PL90 less than 80% predicted and Csp less than 0.08 (Group III).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To address these questions, we studied a random sample of male residents of Leadville, Colorado when the major employer, a hard-rock mine, had been closed for 5 to 11 months. Subjects were interviewed for respiratory symptoms and occupational history, underwent plethysmographic measurements of lung volume and airflow, and performed a single breath diffusing capacity procedure. Dyspnea was the only respiratory symptom exacerbated by mining exposures. Cumulative dust exposure, estimated with historic respirable dust measurements for mining job titles and weighted by time at the job, was associated with decreases in maximal expiratory flow rates when controlled for smoking, age, and height. However, determinations of plethysmographic lung volume that allowed calculation of flow rates at equivalent absolute lung volume indicated that dust effects differed in never-smokers and smokers. In never-smokers, dust exposure was associated with decreased lung volume, increased flow rates, and increased DLCO/VA. In smokers, dust exposure was associated with increased lung volume, lower flow rates, and lower DLCO/VA than that accounted for by smoking. We suggest that hard-rock mining exposures result in irreversible pulmonary function changes of airflow limitation in smokers and of a restrictive nature in never-smokers.\r"

  ".W": "The quantitative measurement of regional aerosol deposition in human lungs using two-dimensional (2D) gamma scintigraphy has proven to be useful in therapeutic and diagnostic aerosol studies. The penetration index (PI) has been defined as the ratio of activity in a peripheral lung zone to a central lung zone, but the ability to discriminate between aerosol deposition in the large airways and lung parenchyma is reduced by the fact that the latter overlies the former in the central zone. To overcome this, we used a three-dimensional (3D) technique. Seven healthy subjects inhaled isotonic saline aerosols containing 99mTc-DTPA on two occasions. The droplets had a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of either 2.6 or 5.5 microns (with geometric standard deviations [sigma g] of 1.4 and 1.7, respectively). Transmission tomography was performed on each subject to delineate lung boundaries in 2D and 3D. After inhalation, anterior (A) and posterior (P) images were collected and a tomographic study performed. Mid-lung slices were taken from coronal (CC) and transverse (TC) sections. PI was calculated on the 2D images (AP and P) and the 3D slices (CC and TC) using exactly defined regions. The PI values were smaller for the large droplet aerosol (5.5 microns) in all subjects and methods. The relative differences in PI between large and small (2.6 microns) droplet studies (d values) were greater and less variable for the 3D methods (TC, 56.5 +/- 11.4% and CC, 52.4 +/- 12.3%) compared to the 2D methods (P, 25.4 +/- 17.1% and AP, 38.3 +/- 15%; p less than 0.005). We found the 3D methods to be more sensitive for discriminating between aerosol deposition in large and small airways than were the conventional 2D methods.\r"

Eight additional patients were studied to evaluate test-retest variability and repositioning errors. Six hours following dexamethasone administration tumor K1 (but not Vb) was significantly reduced compared with contralateral control brain regions (p less than 0.03). These data are consistent with our previously published 24-hour-postdexamethasone data and suggest that comparable effects of corticosteroids on brain/tumor capillaries may be observed at 5 to 6 and 24 hours. The time course of dexamethasone-induced alterations in brain/tumor capillary permeability supports the view that these alterations may be responsible for at least some of the antiedema effects of corticosteroids.\r"

The lymphoproliferative response to measles virus was obtainable in the 4 SSPE patients. In contrast, the CTL response to measles virus was reduced in 3 of the 4 SSPE patients. This defect appeared to be in the generation of the measles virus-specific CTLs, since measles virus-infected target cells from the patients could be lysed by human leukocyte antigen-matched peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy individuals. The SSPE patients with reduced measles virus CTL response had a normal ability to generate mumps virus, influenza virus, or alloantigen-specific CTLs. The lysis of measles virus-infected targets that was observed with these SSPE patients could be reduced by depleting the effectors of natural killer cells or by performing cold target blocking with K562 cells, indicating that the lysis of the measles virus-infected targets was probably mediated by natural killer cells. These results demonstrate a reduction in the cell-mediated immune response to measles virus as measured by the generation of measles virus-specific CTLs in 3 of the 4 SSPE patients studied. This defect could relate to the persistence of measles virus in these patients.\r"

In vitro characterization of the defined virus mixtures revealed that the dye uptake method was quite sensitive in the detection of small amounts (3 to 9%) of acylovir-resistant virus. Mice infected with homogeneous virus populations exhibited a good correlation between clinical response and the in vitro drug susceptibility of the infecting virus. Animals infected with defined mixtures of viruses exhibited varied patterns of infection and responses to acyclovir treatment. However, disease severity was useful in predicting the TK phenotype of virus recovered from lesions. Pathogenic, TK-altered virus was responsible for progressive disease in animals receiving low-dose (0.25-mg/ml) prophylactic acyclovir or high-dose (1.25-mg/ml) delayed therapy. Although this mutant was recovered infrequently, it was responsible for clinically significant disease in the animals from which it was isolated.\r"

Combinations of cefpirome, cefotaxime, and cefazolin with sulbactam (10 micrograms/ml) showed synergistic effects against more than 70% of the strains. Combinations of methicillin and penicillin G with sulbactam also showed synergistic effects against 50 and 68% of the strains, respectively, while cefotiam, moxalactam, flomoxef, and cefmetazole in combination with sulbactam showed such effects against only 40% or fewer. Clavulanic acid was synergistic only when combined with penicillin G, the effect probably being due to the beta-lactamase inhibition by the inhibitor. Sulbactam did not improve the antimicrobial activities of the beta-lactams against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains. At 42 degrees C the MICs of cefotaxime, methicillin, and flomoxef alone were markedly decreased from the values at 35 degrees C, and no synergy between these beta-lactams and sulbactam appeared. The resistance to penicillin G was not inhibited by incubation at 42 degrees C, and combinations of penicillin G with sulbactam and clavulanic acid showed synergy. The amounts of beta-lactamase produced were not related to the decreases in the MICs of the beta-lactams, except for penicillin G combined with sulbactam. Clavulanic acid showed slightly stronger beta-lactamase-inhibiting activity than sulbactam did. These results suggest that the synergy between sulbactam and the beta-lactams, except for penicillin G, may not be due to beta-lactamase inhibition but to suppression of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus-specific resistance based on other factors.\r"

The order of potency of their antiviral activities against HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 was iodo PdR approximately ethynyl PdR approximately propynyl PdR. The antiviral action of iodo PdR is dependent on the ability of HSV to induce virus-specified thymidine kinase in infected cells. Several HSV-1 variants with altered thymidine kinase changed their sensitivity to iodo PdR, whereas HSV-1 variants with altered DNA polymerase were as sensitive as the parental virus to iodo PdR. Continuous presence of iodo PdR for more than one virus replication cycle was required for optimal antiviral activity. Iodo PdR (100 microM) had no activity against Epstein-Barr virus DNA replication in P3HR-1 cells. With an oral, an intraperitoneal, or a subcutaneous route of injection, iodo PdR administered twice a day for 2.5 days could prevent the death of mice infected with HSV-2. This in vivo activity is unlikely to be related to the potential conversion of iodo PdR to iododeoxyuridine, since iodo PdR is not a substrate of xanthine oxidase.\r"

Only a fraction of total concentration of AG in tissue was released into the supernatants of tissue homogenates. However, the remainder was recovered after NaOH solubilization of the residual pellet. Also, it was found that the  G released from the pellet by NaOH was associated with protein. By contrast, trichloroacetic acid precipitation of tissue protein immediately released the drug into the supernatant.\r"

  ".W": "Quality assurance in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery requires a comparison of operative mortality against an accepted standard of care. Raw mortality statistics are unacceptable in this context, and risk factor analysis is essential. However, this principle has not been adequately demonstrated in previous reports. Our goal in this study was to develop a risk model of accepted CABG mortality and illustrate its proper use in coronary artery surgery. The model was derived from a Bayesian analysis of 6,630 patients undergoing CABG in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) registry. Age, sex, ventricular function, previous myocardial infarction, extent of coronary artery disease, unstable angina, and surgical priority were used by the model to sort patients into risk categories. From January 1984 through December 1987, 840 patients underwent isolated CABG at our hospital. With raw mortality data, the 3.9% (33/840) mortality of our patients was significantly different from the 2.3% (153/6,630) CASS mortality (p less than 0.001). When our patients were entered into the CASS model for risk stratification, however, our CABG mortality conformed to the CASS experience. These results illustrate the fallacy of using raw mortality statistics for interinstitutional comparisons. This type of risk model is a fundamental element of CABG quality assurance.\r"

  ".W": "The role of retrograde coronary sinus cardioplegia in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting has not been fully defined. Forty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting received either aortic root (20 patients) or coronary sinus (20 patients) cold potassium blood cardioplegia. The patients were similar with respect to age, ventricular function, severity of coronary artery disease, cross-clamp time, completeness of revascularization, frequency of internal mammary artery grafting, and mean infusate volume and temperature. The time required to deliver the initial dose of cardioplegic solution and the time to achieve arrest were prolonged in the coronary sinus group (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.02, respectively). There were no differences between the two groups postoperatively with regard to enzymatic indices, hemodynamic measurement, or clinical outcome. Right ventricular function was preserved equally in both groups. We conclude that coronary sinus cardioplegia is a safe alternative to aortic root perfusion, but offers no advantage in elective myocardial revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "Experience with 39 patients (32 men, 7 women) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with the right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA) is reported. Indications initially included poor-quality or absent saphenous vein, ascending aortic atherosclerosis, and repeat coronary artery bypass grafting. The average number of grafts per patient was 4.10. Arteries bypassed were the posterior descending (22 patients), right coronary (12), diagonal (5), and marginal (4). Distal RGEA internal diameters of all grafts measured 1.5 to 3.25 mm (average diameter, 2.14 mm). Pedicled graft lengths measured 18 to 30 cm (average length, 23.7 cm), and free grafts, 8 to 24 cm (average length, 17.7 cm). In 6 patients, no vein grafts were used, and in all patients, at least one internal mammary artery graft was placed. Early postoperative cardiac catheterization (19 pedicled and ten free grafts) in 29 patients revealed all grafts to be patent without a kink or twist, but three of these free RGEA grafts had vasospasm. Advantages of RGEA grafts are as follows: (1) it is a third arterial conduit with artery-artery anastomoses of comparable sizes; (2) a shorter leg incision or no leg incision is necessary; (3) it can be harvested simultaneously with the internal mammary artery and the saphenous vein; (4) the proximal anastomosis (free grafts) is easy; (5) its use avoids bilateral internal mammary artery grafts in patients at high risk for sternal infection; and (6) atherosclerotic ascending aortas are not clamped. Subintimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis of RGEA grafts are unlikely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were 17 men and 5 women ranging in age from 34 to 73 years (mean age, 53.4 years). Three patients were having a reoperation, and 2 patients had no segment of long saphenous vein available. Twelve patients were less than 55 years old. The mean number of distal anastomoses including vein grafts was 3.2 and the mean number of arterial grafts was 2.5 per patient. The mean aortic cross-clamp time was 63.8 minutes and the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 116.7 minutes. There was 1 early and 1 late death. The other 20 patients are alive without angina. Studied within 3 postoperative months, graft patency was 95% (19/20) in internal mammary artery and 93% (14/15) in gastroepiploic artery grafts. It is concluded that the combined arterial graft can be used safely and effectively, and its application facilitates complete revascularization with more arterial and fewer vein grafts.\r"

In 1 of them, the GEA was used because no veins were available; in the others, the GEA was used to avoid the use of vein grafts. The GEA was anastomosed to the right coronary artery in all patients, and internal mammary artery grafts were used to bypass the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. All patients survived the operation. There were no early and, to date, there have been no late complications of the abdominal component of the operation. Postoperative coronary angiography showed a patent right GEA in 9 patients (82%). In 1 patient the GEA was occluded, probably because of an enlarged liver. If the long-term patency of right GEA grafts is similar to that of internal mammary artery grafts, wider use of this viable graft is indicated.\r"

We evaluated 121 impotent male veterans (mean age, 68 +/- 5.3 years) to obtain information on potential pathophysiologic mechanisms. Subjects related a complete medical history and underwent physical examination, metabolic assessment, nocturnal penile tumescence monitoring, and vascular and neurologic assessment. The most frequent cause of impotence was the coexistence of neurologic and vascular disorders (30.3%). Other subjects had single causes, including vascular disease (21.1%), diabetic neuropathy (17.1%), nondiabetic neuropathy (10.5%), and psychopathology (9.2%). Remaining patients suffered from adverse drug effects (3.9%), hypogonadism (2.6%), and Peyronie's disease (1.3%). Five patients were objectively impotent on the basis of nocturnal penile tumescence, but otherwise normal. We conclude that geriatric impotence is primarily related to vascular or neurologic dysfunction. However, 15.7% of aged impotent men may have reversible impotence (eg, psychogenic causes or hypogonadism), and an additional 31.5% may have a treatable disorder (eg, penile neuropathy).\r"

The group with OCD showed an increased glucose metabolism in the left orbital frontal, right sensorimotor, and bilateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions as compared with controls. Ratios of regional activity to mean cortical gray matter metabolism were increased for the right prefrontal and left anterior cingulate regions in the group with OCD as a whole. Correlations between glucose metabolism and clinical assessment measures showed a significant relationship between metabolic activity and both state and trait measurements of OCD and anxiety as well as the response to clomipramine hydrochloride therapy. These results are consistent with the suggestion that OCD may result from a functional disturbance in the frontal-limbic-basal ganglia system.\r"

One hundred fifteen patients who presented during a four-year period and underwent neodymium-YAG laser treatment on both sides of the peritoneal reflection (rectum, 47 patients; colon, 68 patients) were reviewed. The various lesions treated with laser therapy included 32 malignant tumors that presented with bleeding or obstruction, 44 large broad-based villous adenomas, six carcinoid tumors, and 33 patients with arteriovenous malformations or radiation proctitis who presented with acute hemorrhage or chronic blood loss. Overall treatment efficiency was 83% in the rectal group vs 87% in the colonic group. There was no significant difference in complication frequency or severity between the two groups, even though 45% of the colonic lesions were located in the thin-walled cecum. There was no laser-related mortality in this series. Laser photoablative therapy is safe and effective treatment for a wide variety of colorectal lesions. In experienced hands, it can be used on either side of the peritoneal reflection with equal efficiency and no increased risk of complications.\r"

  ".W": "By using stereotaxic surgical techniques, ventral mesencephalic tissues from aborted human fetuses of 8 to 10 weeks' gestational age were implanted unilaterally into the striata in two patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. The patients were treated with a cyclosporine, azathioprine, and steroid regimen to minimize the risk for graft rejection. They were examined for 6 months preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively and continued to receive the same doses of antiparkinsonian medication. There were no significant postoperative complications. No major therapeutic effect from the operation was observed. However, in the clinical tests, both patients showed small but significant increases of movement speed for repeated pronation-supination, fist clenching, and foot lifting. The rate of walking also increased in the one patient tested. For both patients, there was an initial worsening postoperatively, followed by improvement vs preoperative performance at 1 to 3 months. Both patients also showed significant improvement in the magnitude of response to a single dose of levodopa (L-dopa), but there was no increase in the duration of drug action. The motor readiness potential increased in both patients postoperatively, primarily over the operated hemisphere. Neurophysiological measurements also showed a more rapid performance of simple and complex arm and hand movements on the side contralateral to transplantation in one patient at 5 months postoperatively. Positron emission tomography demonstrated no increased uptake of 6-L-(18F)-fluorodopa in the transplanted striatum at 5 and 6 months. Taken together, these results suggest that the fetal nigral implants may have provided a modest improvement in motor function, consistent with the presence of small surviving grafts. Although our results support further scientific experimentation with transplantation in Parkinson's disease, widespread clinical trials with this procedure are probably not warranted at this time.\r"

All neuro-SPECT imaging was performed within 30 days after infarction. Detailed assessment of neurologic and/or language recovery (after 3 months) was carried out prospectively in each patient. Patients with smaller volume IMP defects in the region of infarction demonstrated significantly better neurologic and language recovery than patients with large IMP defects.

Using this scheme, fundus photographs of 777 participants were graded in a population-based study of watermen from the eastern shore of Maryland. The prevalence of at least one druse within 1500 microns of the foveal center was extremely common (over 80% in each age group over 30 years of age) and not age related. The prevalence of large, confluent, or soft drusen was relatively uncommon and was age related; by the eighth decade, 26% of all participants had large or soft drusen, and 17% of them had confluent drusen. These latter characteristics are more likely to be markers of early changes consistent with age-related macular degeneration rather than simply the presence of a few drusen.\r"

Of the 20 patients who had ophthalmic lesions, 16 had eyelid lesions and seven had conjunctival lesions. In four patients, the ophthalmic lesion was the first, and initially the only, clinically identified manifestation of Kaposi sarcoma. The second study was a retrospective review of all patients with ophthalmic Kaposi sarcoma examined at one institution over a six-year period to determine its natural history and response to therapy. Most lesions were slowly progressive and responded to systemic drug therapy. Six patients were successfully treated with radiation therapy to prevent complications. The third study was a retrospective review of all patients with AIDS-related ophthalmic Kaposi sarcoma treated with local irradiation by one radiation oncologist. Each of 12 patients showed a response to treatment, and ten had a complete resolution of lesions, but recurrences were common. Side effects included skin erythema in six patients and hair loss in one patient.

Systemic evaluation revealed no evidence of mycobacterial, fungal, or spirochetal disease. Fluorescein angiography of the lesions showed early hypofluorescence with late staining of the lesions, which appeared deep to the retinal circulation. There was no evidence of retinal involvement. Over a 4-month period of observation, the lesions appeared to enlarge slowly, with no evidence of vitreous cells or debris in the overlying retina. A transscleral choroidal biopsy was performed, and electron microscopy showed numerous cystic structures characteristic of Pneumocystis carinii within necrotic choroid. The lack of inflammatory changes clinically, by fluorescein angiography, and histopathologically was striking.\r"

  ".W": "As some ultraviolet (UV) radiation is transmitted by the ocular media, there is a growing concern that there may be a possible relationship between long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation and increased risk of age-related macular degeneration. To address this question, a survey was conducted of 838 Maryland watermen who had well-characterized ocular UV-A and UV-B exposure. Fundus photographs were taken and graded for presence of exudative disease, geographic atrophy, focal hyperpigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium, and drusen that were large and/or confluent. None of the subjects in these analyses were aphakic. The results suggested that age-related macular degeneration was not associated with cumulative exposure to either UV-A or UV-B. Age and the presence of nuclear opacity were independently associated with an increased risk of macular degeneration. Thus, we found that in phakic subjects, even with high levels of sunlight exposure, there was no evidence of increased risk of age-related macular degeneration associated with UV-B or UV-A exposure.\r"

  ".W": "The silent period that follows infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and precedes seroconversion remains a problem for the screening of blood supply, and knowledge about the mechanism involved in the maintenance of latency is only fragmentary. Using purified nef recombinant protein and six synthetic nef peptides, antibodies to the product of an HIV-1 regulatory gene, the negative regulatory factor (nef) involved in maintenance of proviral latency, were detected by Western blot and radioimmunoassay techniques in HIV-1-seronegative, viral antigen-negative, and virus culture-negative individuals at risk for HIV infection. This antibody response to nef was correlated in eight individuals with the detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA by oligonucleotide hybridization, following enzymatic amplification of HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such latent HIV infections have now been followed for up to 6 or 10 months in five individuals. In addition, retrospective and prospective analysis of HIV-1-seropositive individuals have shown (1) antibodies to nef preceding seroconversion, and (2) the persistence of antibodies to nef and of HIV-1 proviral DNA in a case of spontaneous complete HIV-1 seronegativation. Since DNA amplification cannot be currently considered for routine use, screening for anti-nef antibodies followed by confirmation by DNA amplification could represent a basis for new diagnostic strategies. Beyond their diagnostic implications, these findings, suggesting that regulatory genes of the HIV-1 provirus can be expressed prior to the initiation of virion synthesis, may also be applicable in the design of alternative vaccines against the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "89274045\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of different HIV-1 isolates on normal human B lymphocyte function has been studied in vitro. Production of IgM and IgG was measured by ELISA using a \"standard\" non-T preparation of B cells depleted of macrophages and T cells (but not of low-density accessory cells, LDC). Only one (H9/CBL-4) of five different isolates induced polyclonal production of immunoglobulin. Apart from intrinsic differences between isolates, important inherent variables were shown to affect the response. One was the mix of cell types in the responding preparation of B cells. This was tested by examining the effects of HIV-1 isolates independently on the accessory function of LDC and on B cell function when the LDC were removed. Isolate H9/HTLV-IIIRf was nonstimulatory on a B cell preparation containing LDC and suppressive on LDC accessory function yet could enhance function of B cells when the LDC were depleted. Another variable was the donor of the normal B cells. The B cell response was consistent with each donor but varied greatly with different donors. Thus, no single explanation emerges for the hypergammaglobulinemia in some adult AIDS patients and for the hypogammaglobulinemia in some pediatric cases. Additionally, the cell lines used to propagate the virus particularly affected the assay of B cells depleted of LDC. Uninfected supernatants had different effects on the B cell function, and these host cell effects (perhaps by release of cytokines or other mediators) may be exacerbated in infected cell lines. Our data show the complexity of the abnormal B cell function in AIDS.\r"

Ketanserin reduced the nitroprusside requirements and improved the quality of arterial pressure control in all groups, and this was significant in the low- and high-dose groups. There was a significant decrease in heart rate in the low- and high-dose groups compared with placebo, and no effect in patients who received the medium dose of ketanserin.

Five-point PAP/Q and SAP/Q plots were obtained by opening an arterio-venous femoral fistula or by stepwise inflations of an inferior vena cava balloon. Over the range of Q studied (2-5 litre min-1), hypoxia increased PAP in eight dogs (\"responders\") and did not affect PAP in seven others (\"non-responders\"). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) was restored in non-responders by the administration of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 1 g i.v. Hypoxia did not affect SAP over the range of Q studied in the responders or in the non-responders treated with ASA. Propofol had no effect on hyperoxic or on hypoxic PAP at all values of Q either in responders or in non-responders with HPV restored by ASA. Propofol did not change Q at uncontrolled flow, but decreased SAP at the lowest Q (2 and 3 litre min-1) during hyperoxia and at all values of Q during hypoxia. The systemic vascular effects were the same in animals of both groups, treated with ASA or not. We conclude that propofol does not influence pulmonary vascular tone and does not inhibit HPV, but reduces systemic vascular tone when venous return or oxygenation is decreased. The haemodynamic response to propofol was not affected by cyclo-oxygenase inhibition.\r"

T cells from patients with thyroid autoimmunity proliferated in response to eye muscle, but again this was not specific for eye muscle or the presence of ophthalmopathy. No single antigen was responsible for inducing proliferation. These results fail to confirm a recent report of eye muscle membrane binding antibodies in a high proportion of patients with ophthalmopathy, and suggest instead that T and B cell autoreactivity to striated muscle antigens is a frequent feature of autoimmune thyroid disease, unlikely to be directly related to eye disease.\r"

Two multimers were found in lysates prepared from confluent cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The smaller multimer had a molecular weight (mol wt) of approximately 950 Kd, while the second was larger than those seen in plasma. When electrophoresis was performed using the discontinuous buffer system of Ruggeri and Zimmerman, the small multimer consisted of a single band migrating with the slowest-moving component of the corresponding plasma triplet. The large EC-vWF multimer was detected in culture media conditioned with EC monolayers for ten minutes. It remained the only multimer in media conditioned for up to three days. Calcium ionophore A23187 increased the amount of the large vWF multimer released into the culture media, but did not change its multimeric composition. The small multimer was never detected in the EC-conditioned media. These findings suggest that (1) a large, fully polymerized multimer of vWF is released from the ECs, while the small multimer probably represents a major intermediate component in the process of multimerization, and (2) plasma vWF multimers are probably generated from the large endothelial vWF after it is released into the circulation.\r"

Furthermore, IL-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was also augmented in IL-1 alpha-stimulated myeloma cells. Therefore rIL-1 alpha stimulates myeloma cells to produce IL-6, which consequently augments proliferation of myeloma cells.

  ".W": "The influence of interferon (IFN) on cellular proliferation, blast transformation, and differentiation was studied in lymph node cells from 17 patients with B-cell lymphomas, one patient with T-cell lymphoma, and eight patients with enlarged, non-malignant lymph nodes. The effects of IFN on lymph node cells were compared with effects on mononuclear blood cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and healthy donors. Natural IFN-alpha (nIFN-alpha) induced a proliferative response in cells from seven of 17 of the B-cell lymphomas, in two of eight of the non-malignant lymph nodes, and in lymphoid blood cells from two of 32 CLL patients. With few exceptions, the proliferating cells were B cells and the data suggest that IFN acts directly on the B cells. Proliferation was not induced with IFN in cells from the T-cell lymphoma or in mononuclear blood cells from 13 healthy donors. nIFN-alpha induced blast transformation in cells from ten of 14 of the B-cell lymphomas and in four of seven of the non-malignant lymph nodes. Also beta- and gamma-IFN were shown to induce proliferation and blast transformation in lymph node cells from some patients. No major effect on the expression of various differentiation markers could be observed following culture in the presence of nIFN-alpha. We conclude that IFNs can induce proliferation and blast transformation in malignant and non-malignant B cells from lymph nodes.\r"

When malignant cells were cultured in the presence of insulin-like growth factor I under hypoxic conditions, cellular proliferation occurred that resulted in the establishment of immortal cell lines from ten of 12 patient tumors. Authenticity of each cell line was verified by a direct comparison of the immunophenotype, karyotype, and immunogenotype with the patient's tumor cells. This improved method of cell culture permits frequent establishment of cell lines from patients with T-ALL/T-LL, thereby aiding in analysis of thymocyte transformation and neoplasia.\r"

Mean serum BGP concentrations were significantly higher in patients with active arthritis than in patients with mild activity (p less than 0.01) and controls (p less than 0.01). No significant difference was found in serum BGP levels and in other parameters of bone turnover when the patients were stratified according to functional class or duration of disease. There was a correlation between BGP and alkaline phosphatase levels only in RA patients with high activity of disease. Our data suggest an accelerated bone turnover in patients with active RA. We infer that in such patients the impairment of bone metabolism is a determinant of RA-associated osteopenia. Disease activity rather than functional impairment or duration of arthritis should be regarded as a factor in the bone loss of RA.\r"

Only 13% had Gram-negative bacteria in significant numbers but 43% had Gram-positives using the same criteria. Half of the patients were symptom-free by the end of a 12-week course of antibiotics and remained so after 6 months; in one-third the symptoms were unchanged 6 months after completing treatment. The relief of symptoms correlated with the disappearance of white blood cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) and with a lowered pH in the EPS. Thus only 1 of the 14 patients without symptoms at 6 months had a significant growth of bacteria at the prostatic level, whereas 7 of 10 patients with unchanged symptoms had a significant bacterial colonisation. Although the initially infecting organism was eliminated in about half of the patients, new Gram-positive bacteria were isolated after treatment in 13 of 29 patients; 12 of these resolved spontaneously within 6 months. Five patients with Gram-positive bacteria were colonised with new Gram-negatives at the end of treatment. Two healed spontaneously but 3 remained colonised with Gram-negatives at the end of the follow-up period. These findings make it likely that many patients infected with Gram-positive bacteria benefit from antibiotic treatment. However, disturbances in the bacterial flora by antibiotic treatment may facilitate invasion by new types of bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients are reported who shared the combination of bilateral basal ganglia lesions and a frontal lobe-like syndrome. The main features were inertia and loss of drive, with preservation of intellectual function. Some patients showed stereotyped activities with compulsive and obsessive behaviour which were sometimes highly elaborate in pattern. Extrapyramidal clinical signs were absent or mild. Brain damage, related to anoxic or toxic encephalopathy, was demonstrated by CT scans and MRI. The lesions appeared to be confined to the lentiform nuclei, particularly affecting the pallidum, although there was generalized brain atrophy in 2 cases. Positron emission tomography (PET) in 7 patients revealed hypometabolism of the prefrontal cortex relative to other parts of the brain. The PET studies suggest dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex as a result of damage to the lentiform nuclei. These clinical, anatomical and functional observations emphasize the role of the circuits linking the prefrontal associative cortex and some specific areas of the neostriatum, including the pallidum. The existence of distinct nonoverlapping circuits in the motor field or in the associative field can explain the fact that basal ganglia lesions may give rise to a clinical picture that is either purely motor, purely behavioural (as in some of our patients), or both. Similarities existed between some symptoms found in our patients and certain features of major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression, catatonic schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This raises the hypothesis that some aspects of these psychiatric disorders could be related to structural and physiological disturbances in the systems linking the frontal associative cortex and the basal ganglia.\r"

The accuracy of the coded diagnoses was checked by examination of the hospital notes of 144 patients. The coded diagnosis was incorrect in 11/83 coded as Crohn's disease and 13/61 as ulcerative colitis; frequency of incorrect coding did not change significantly with time. Despite an 18% fall in the population aged less than or equal to 16 during this time, the number of new cases of Crohn's disease rose from 10 in 1968 to 28 in 1983. Thus the recorded incidence of Crohn's disease in Scottish children has risen more than three-fold in 16 years, from 6.6 to 22.9 per million (p less than 0.0001), with no difference between the sexes. Parallel data for ulcerative colitis were rendered inaccurate by miscoding of infective gastroenteritis as colitis. In an attempt to reduce this source of error cases aged five years and under were excluded from analysis, resulting in an incidence of 19.1 cases per million aged six to 16 in 1968 and 15.6 in 1983, not a significant change (r = 0.42, p = 0.052). When males and females were analysed separately, however, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of UC in male children (r = -0.4, p = 0.028), with no change for female children (r = 0.1, p = 0.595).\r"

Two animals were injected at their resting CO, two were injected during increased CO (arteriovenous fistulas induced), and two were injected at low CO (phlebotomy induced). The chest was opened and the lungs were removed, drained of blood, and dried while fully inflated. Single-photon emission-computed tomography was performed on the dry lungs to map the distribution of activity in transverse, coronal, and sagittal slices. The results confirmed the presence of a central-peripheral gravity-nondependent gradient and showed that increases in CO were associated with increases in absolute flow to both the central and peripheral regions of the lung with persistence of the central-peripheral gradient. These observations were further confirmed by direct imaging of midcoronal slices. Examination of the average flow in vertical and horizontal slices showed that, when zone 1 was not present, changes in CO affected all slices uniformly, such that when the CO doubled, the absolute flow in every slice in all three planes also doubled. We conclude that, with the exception of recruitment and derecruitment of vascular channels in the upper regions of the lung (zone 1), when CO changes, the blood flow everywhere in the lung changes uniformly and in proportion to the CO. This uniform increase in blood flow is consistent with the three-dimensional nature and resistive properties of the pulmonary vascular tree.\r"

This allows the calculation of regional ventilation-to-perfusion (V/Q) ratios by use of established tracer dilution theory and the constant intravenous infusion of 13N. This paper considers the effect of the inspiration of dead-space gas on regional V/Q and investigates the relationship between the measured V/Q, physiological V/Q, and V/Q defined conventionally in terms of bulk gas flow (VA/Q). Ventilation has been described in terms of net gas transport, and the term effective ventilation has been introduced. A simple two-compartment model has been constructed to allow for the reinspiration of regional (or personal) and common dead-space gas. By use of this model, with parameters representative of normal lung the effective V/Q ratio for 13N [(VA/Q)eff(13N)] is shown to overestimate VA/Q by 18% when VA/Q = 0.1 but underestimate VA/Q by 68% when VA/Q = 10. For physiological gases, the model predicts that the behavior of O2 should be similar to that of 13N, so that, in terms of gas transport, V/Q ratios obtained using the infusion of 13N closely follow those for O2. Values of the effective V/Q ratio for CO2 [(VA/Q)eff(CO2)] lie approximately halfway between (VA/Q)eff(13N) and VA/Q. These results indicate that dead-space ventilation is far less a confounding issue when V/Q is considered in terms of net gas transport (VAeff), rather than bulk flow (VA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this paper we describe a technique to measure regional ventilation-perfusion ratios (V/Q), in absolute units, by use of PET and the continuous intravenous infusion of an inert gas isotope, 13N, and report on measurements made in 12 normal subjects (4 smokers). Data were obtained from a single lung section (slice thickness, 1.7 cm full width at half-maximum response to a line source) at the level of the right ventricle in the supine posture during quiet breathing. For the 12 subjects, volume-weighted mean values of V/Q, averaged over individual right and left lung fields, ranged from 0.50 to 1.29. Analysis of these means showed no difference between lungs: right, 0.80 +/- 0.23 SD; left, 0.76 +/- 0.20 SD. Topographically, a systematic fall of V/Q in the ventrodorsal direction was observed in eight of the subjects (mean ventrodorsal difference 0.39, range 0.19-0.90), whereas two showed a clear increase toward dependent lung regions (range 0.16-0.26). Seven of the subjects with a falling ventrodorsal V/Q gradient also exhibited discrete regions of low V/Q at the dorsal lung border. We conclude that, in normal subjects, ventilation and perfusion are generally well matched in the supine posture, but isolated mismatching often occurs in dependent lung regions.\r"

  ".W": "The hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes and production of growth-promoting factors (including interleukin-2) (IL2) in CTLL2 murine cells. In this study, we investigated the role of monocytes in this hormone-mediated inhibitory effect, by testing the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the ability of the mitogenic lectin phytohemagglutinin (PHA) to induce T cell activation in either a monocyte-dependent or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-driven (monocyte-independent) system. The results indicate that proliferation of T cells and production of growth-promoting factors are inhibited by 1,25-(OH)2D3 only in the monocyte-dependent system. Preincubation of monocytes with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for various periods of time and subsequent removal of the hormone resulted in inhibition of the PHA-driven proliferation of T cells. Preincubation for 2 h resulted in 20% inhibition, while preincubation for 36 h reduced proliferation to 50% of the control value [no 1,25-(OH)2D3 exposure]. These data suggested that monocytes are important participants in 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated events. Therefore, we tested the effects of the hormone on the production of IL1, a monocyte-derived product thought to be involved in the induction of IL2 release and the subsequent development of the T cell proliferative response. 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited the production of both extracellular and cell-associated immunoreactive IL1 alpha and IL1 beta. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, did not alter the inhibitory properties of 1,25-(OH)2D3, suggesting that prostaglandins are not responsible for the inhibitory phenomenon. We conclude that part of the ability of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to inhibit T cell proliferation may be due to direct effects on monocytes by down-regulating IL-1 production. However, it is unlikely that the immunoregulatory properties of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on T cells are mediated solely through monocytes, and it is possible that the hormone also exerts its influence directly on T cells.\r"

Most patients with Cushing's disease have increased plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH, while patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome do not. We predicted that the homologous hormone human CRH (hCRH) might be an equally useful diagnostic agent, with the theoretic advantage of being less immunogenic. This study compared the responses to hCRH and oCRH (1 microgram/kg, iv) in 15 patients with Cushing's disease. Plasma ACTH and cortisol levels increased in most patients during the first hour after administration of either hCRH or oCRH. However, the peak and time-integrated hormonal responses to hCRH were smaller than the responses to oCRH. All but 1 patient had an ACTH and/or cortisol response to oCRH that exceeded 4 times the intraassay coefficient of variation. Three patients had neither an ACTH nor a cortisol response to hCRH by the same criterion. Thus, when administered at equivalent doses, hCRH is a less effective stimulus of ACTH and cortisol secretion in patients with Cushing's disease. Based upon the observation that the oCRH stimulation test has greater sensitivity than the hCRH stimulation test for the diagnosis of Cushing's disease, we conclude that oCRH is the preferred analog to use for CRH testing in patients with Cushing's syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma CRH levels are considerably higher in women during the third trimester of pregnancy than in non-pregnant women. Most of plasma CRH in pregnant women is bound to CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP). To gain further insight into CRH physiology during pregnancy, we measured the responses of plasma ACTH and cortisol and the changes in bound and free forms of CRH in plasma after human CRH administration (2 micrograms/kg) in five pregnant (39-40 weeks of pregnancy) and five nonpregnant women. The mean basal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels in the pregnant women were higher than those in the nonpregnant women. However, the maximum increments in plasma ACTH and cortisol levels and the integrated ACTH and cortisol responses, after subtraction of the basal levels after CRH administration, were similar in the two groups. The plasma CRH half-time in the pregnant group was similar to that in the nonpregnant group. The mean basal plasma CRH level in the nonpregnant women was 1.5 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) pmol/L, and that in the pregnant women was 360 +/- 35 pmol/L. On gel filtration chromatography, almost all of the CRH in the plasma was protein bound (320 +/- 30 pmol/L) in the pregnant women; no CRH peaks were detected in nonpregnant women because of the low plasma CRH levels. After CRH administration, the level of the bound form of plasma CRH was highest at 5 min, and then declined to a plateau at 15 min and 30 min in the pregnant women. In the nonpregnant women, protein-bound CRH also was highest at 5 min, but it progressively declined thereafter. The disappearance rate of the bound CRH in plasma from the nonpregnant women was similar to that of the second compartment of the plasma decay curves of the free CRH from both groups. We conclude that the plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to exogenous CRH are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women, the effect of CRH-BP on the disappearance of plasma CRH is minimal, and plasma CRH-BP in pregnant women has the capacity to bind additional CRH.\r"

  ".W": "Antihuman IgE is often used to study basophil- and mast cell-mediator release in vitro but is infrequently used in vivo. To evaluate in vivo skin reactivity to anti-IgE, an affinity-purified rabbit F(ab')2 fragment of antihuman IgE was injected intradermally in 22 nonallergic and 27 allergic subjects. All 49 subjects (including a subject with less than 1 ng/ml of total serum IgE) had positive immediate cutaneous reactions to anti-IgE. Although total serum IgE level was weakly correlated (r = -0.51; p less than 0.005) with in vivo skin reactivity to anti-IgE for the entire population, allergic subjects did not have significantly increased skin reactivity compared to nonallergic subjects (p = 0.18), despite having higher total serum IgE levels (p less than 0.002). A late-phase cutaneous response (LPR) to anti-IgE occurred in 60% of the allergic and in 50% of the nonallergic subjects. Subjects with an LPR required approximately tenfold higher concentrations of anti-IgE to produce an immediate wheal of 10 mm compared to subjects who did not develop an LPR (p = 0.02), suggesting that the concentration of the stimulus injected is more important for the development of a LPR than the size of the immediate cutaneous response. Skin reactivity to codeine phosphate (a non-IgE-dependent secretagogue) was correlated with skin reactivity to anti-IgE (r = 0.47; p less than 0.05), suggesting that in vivo skin mast cell degranulation is partially a function of mast cell releasability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human monocytes and tissue macrophages exhibit a marked decrease in LPS-stimulated IL-1 production. Preincubation of monocytes in 100 U/ml IFN-gamma or in 0.25 microgram/ml cycloheximide (Cx) leads to a partial maintenance of the ability to produce IL-1 in response to subsequent stimulation with LPS, whereas preincubation in both reagents leads to a near complete maintenance of this response. These studies were performed to determine the mechanisms of these alterations in regulation of IL-1 production in cultured monocytes. In comparison to LPS-induced fresh monocytes, cells preincubated in medium for 1 day, then stimulated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml LPS, exhibited a 50% or more decrease in steady-state IL-1 beta mRNA levels. This reduction was accompanied by a four- to fivefold decrease in relative transcriptional rate, as determined by the nuclear run-on technique. The medium-aged cells also displayed greatly decreased IL-1 beta production with deficient secretion. Monocytes preincubated in IFN-gamma for 1 day before LPS stimulation exhibited a variable maintenance in IL-1 beta production, secondary both to prolonged duration of transcription and to increased IL-1 beta mRNA stability. Monocytes were preincubated for 1 day in Cx alone or in both IFN-gamma and cycloheximide, then these substances were washed out before a subsequent 24-h culture in LPS. Cx preincubation led to increases in both the peak and duration of transcription as well as to enhanced secretion of IL-1 beta protein. Monocytes preincubated in both IFN-gamma and Cx exhibited increased IL-1 beta mRNA levels due to both enhanced transcription and mRNA stability; more IL-1 beta protein secretion also was present in these cells. In summary, IFN-gamma and Cx may maintain LPS-induced IL-1 beta production in cultured human monocytes through multiple mechanisms. These alterations in regulation of IL-1 beta production during monocyte differentiation may be relevant to tissue macrophages where impaired IL-1 production may be present.\r"

  ".U": "89278640\r", 
  ".W": "The regulation of IL-2 gene expression during T cell activation and proliferation has been investigated in primary cultures of purified human peripheral blood T cells. Prior results indicated that stimulation of T cells by anti-CD28 mAb plus PMA could induce IL-2 expression and T cell proliferation that was entirely resistant to cyclosporine. The present studies examined whether CD28 augments IL-2 expression by a unique pathway or merely acts at a point common to CD3-induced proliferation but distal to the effects of cyclosporine. The induction of maximal IL-2 gene expression required three signals provided by phorbol ester, calcium ionophore, and anti-CD28 mAb. Stimulation of cells by optimal amounts of calcium ionophore and PMA induced IL-2 mRNA that was completely suppressed by cyclosporine. The addition of anti-CD28 to T cells stimulated with PMA plus calcium ionophore induced a 5- to 100-fold increase in IL-2 gene expression and secretion that was resistant to cyclosporine. The CD28 signal was able to increase steady state IL-2 mRNA levels even in cells treated with maximally tolerated amounts of calcium ionophore and PMA. The three-signal requirement did not reflect differential regulation of lymphokine gene expression between the CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets or differences in the kinetics of IL-2 mRNA expression. The signal provided by CD28 is distinct from that of CD3 because although anti-CD28 plus PMA-induced proliferation is resistant to cyclosporine, anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus PMA-induced IL-2 expression is sensitive. Thus, these studies show that three biochemically distinct signals are required for maximal IL-2 gene expression. Furthermore, these studies suggest that lymphokine production in T cells is not controlled by an \"on/off\" switch, but rather, that CD28 regulates a distinct intracellular pathway which modulates the level of IL-2 production on a per cell basis. The observation that CD28 stimulation results in IL-2 concentrations that exceed 1000 U/m1 in tissue culture supernatants suggests that a role in vivo for CD28 might be to amplify immune responses initiated by the CD3/T cell receptor complex. Finally, the observation that CD28 interacts with the signals provided by PMA and calcium ionophore shows that the function of CD28 is not merely to act as a scaffold to stabilize or enhance signalling through the CD3/TCR complex.\r"

  ".W": "This study analyzed 1) the relationship between the molecules recognized by anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mAb RR 1/1 and by anti-96K melanoma-associated Ag mAb CL203.4 in lymphoid cells, 2) the induction of ICAM-1 on activated PBMC, and 3) the functional activity of distinct and spatially distant determinants recognized by mAb CL203.4 and RR1/1. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the determinant recognized by mAb CL203.4 is expressed on a slightly broader population of ICAM-1 molecules than that defined by mAb RR1/1. Serologic and immunochemical assays have shown that ICAM-1 is induced on lymphocytes activated with Con A, PHA-M, IL-2, allogeneic HLA mismatched lymphocytes and autologous PHA-M-activated T cells. However, ICAM-1 was not detected on lymphocytes incubated with IFN-gamma. Incubation of monocytes with LPS induced ICAM-1 in the subpopulation which lacks it and increased its density on the cells which express it. Induction of ICAM-1 is an early event in the activation process and precedes the appearance of IL-2 and transferrin receptors. Comparison of the functional activity of the anti-ICAM-1 mAb CL203.4 and RR1/1 showed that both of them inhibit to a similar extent proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated with PHA-M and with allogeneic lymphocytes, but that only mAb RR1/1 inhibits PMA-induced aggregation of cultured B lymphoid cells JY, of promonocytic cells U-937 and of PHA-blasts as well as LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity of target cells. mAb CL203.4 represents the first example of anti-ICAM-1 mAb without inhibitory effect on the aggregation of lymphoid cells. The differential functional activity of mAb CL203.4 and RR1/1 does not reflect differences in their affinity, because they display a similar affinity constant to lymphoid cells. These results suggest that distinct determinants of ICAM-1 play a different role in immunologic phenomena.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that circulating immune complexes (IC) could modify lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity or release was explored in in vitro systems. IC were precipitated at antibody-Ag equivalence by using specific rabbit antisera and Ag from inactivated rubella virus and hemagglutinins from purified whole virions from three prototype strains of influenza (A/Brazil, A/Bangkok, and B/Singapore) as well as from a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoid adsorbed with inactivated pertussis. After resolubilization, these IC were exposed to delipidated homogenates of rat epididymal fat pads before assay for LPL activity. LPL activity was stimulated two- to three-fold by the presence of 20 to 40 micrograms IC protein. This effect is not caused by the individual components of the IC because neither the specific Ag nor the individual antisera had any significant effect on LPL activity. With the rubella IC, a greater stimulatory effect was seen with increase in IC protein. With the influenza and diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT) IC, however, inhibition occurred when IC protein exceeded the amount of protein used for the LPL assay. C did not appear to be involved because IC prepared with heated antisera had similar effects. When intact rat epididymal fat pads were exposed to the rubella, influenza, or DPT IC, LPL activity recovered in the suspension medium was increased in each instance compared with pads exposed to a comparable amount of albumin. These findings may have implications for specific lipid changes that may occur during the immediate post-infectious period following rubella, influenza, or infections with the several bacteria whose Ag were present in the DPT IC used in these studies.\r"

T191 also blocked down-regulation of the CD3-TCR complex induced by an anti-CD3 mAb. Vanadate, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, partially blocks the effect of T191 and restored mobilization of intracellular calcium. Assays of the immunoprecipitates of T191 and CD45 from both Jurkat-BM1 and peripheral T cells showed that the immune complexes had intrinsic phosphatase activity. A parallel immunoprecipitate using a mAb (4-10) against HLA class I showed no such activity. Further analysis of the T191 immunocomplex revealed activity against phosphotyrosine, p-nitrophenylphosphate, and [32P-poly-glu-tyr, but not against phosphoserine. Phosphatase activity was inhibited by Vanadate, but not by Zn2+ or F-. These results show that CD45 is a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, and strongly suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is critically involved in activation of T cells through the TCR-CD3 complex.\r"

  ".W": "In RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells, Ag that crosslink IgE-receptor complexes stimulate the turnover of inositol phospholipids, the mobilization of Ca2+ from intra- and extracellular sources, the release of serotonin and other substances from granules and the transformation of the cell surface from a microvillous to a lamellar architecture. This study explores the role of GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) in the control of these biochemical and functional responses. We report that incubating RBL-2H3 cells for 4 h with 10 microM mycophenolic acid (MPA), an inhibitor of de novo GTP synthesis, reduces GTP levels by over 60% and causes an average reduction of 50% in Ag-stimulated serotonin release. This inhibition of secretion is associated with a 50% decrease in the rate of 45Ca2+ influx in MPA-treated cells. In contrast, Ag-stimulated inositol trisphosphate production is only slightly reduced, indicating that the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C can be activated by Ag in GTP-depleted cells. The membrane responses to IgE receptor cross-linking are unaffected by incubating cells with MPA. Exogenous guanine or guanosine protects the GTP pools in MPA-treated cells and permits normal ion transport and secretory responses to Ag; adenine does not. These results implicate a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in the control of IgE receptor-dependent signal transduction in RBL-2H3 cells. This protein may particularly control the Ca2+ influx pathway that is essential for secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Blast transformation studies have indicated a diminished T cell response in spleen cell preparations from rabbits infected with Treponema pallidum. IL-2 synthesis by T lymphocytes is required for proliferation of these cells. Thus, Con A-induced IL-2 generation was measured in syphilitic animals infected for 9 to 14 days. IL-2 production in the infected rabbits was only one-half that observed for uninfected rabbits. This marked decrease in IL-2 was not caused by decreased IL-1 secretion by adherent cells from infected animals because similar levels were found in both infected and uninfected splenic cultures. This decrease was also not caused by an increase in infected spleen cell adsorption of IL-2; similar numbers of receptors for this IL were present in Con A-stimulated infected and uninfected splenic preparations. The inhibited IL-2 production in infected spleen cells was reversed upon removal of the adherent cells and also elevated upon addition of indomethacin to the cultures. PGE levels were also elevated in splenic cultures from infected animals. Finally, IL-2 synthesis, when evaluated at various days postinfection, showed that at 4 days, splenic cells generated twice as much IL-2 as uninfected cells. At 9 to 14 days, IL-2 levels were dramatically decreased (50% lower than that observed in uninfected cultures), and suppression of IL-2 by adherent cells was observed as late as 35 days post-infection. We propose that premature down regulation (suppression) of IL-2 secretion is mediated by adherent cells via a cyclo-oxygenase product, most likely PGE. These results may explain why most, but not all, treponemes are cleared during infection, and why the secondary manifestations of the disease occur.\r"

Our results indicate that LPS alone induces rearrangement of the gamma 3 genes on both chromosomes whereas stimulation with LPS plus IL-4 results in deletion of gamma 3 genes and rearrangement of gamma 1 genes on both chromosomes. The studies definitively establish the role of IL-4 in directed switch recombination to the gamma 1 locus in LPS-stimulated murine B cells.\r"

  ".U": "89278677\r", 
  ".W": "The class II molecules of the MHC not only bind processed antigenic peptides but also interact with the TCR. This latter interaction is thought to be the basis for allele specific \"restriction\" of Ag presentation to T cells. The specificity of this interaction is likely due to amino acid differences in a small number of polymorphic or \"hypervariable\" regions located in the amino terminal domains of the alpha- and beta-chains. We have explored the functional significance of these polymorphic regions in an I-Ak-restricted, hen egg lysozyme specific Ag presentation system in which the measurement of IL-2 production by T cell hybridomas was used as the indicator of TCR recognition of the I-A/Ag complex. Chimeric I-A molecules, in which b allelic residues were substituted in one or more of the polymorphic regions of the A alpha k chain or in which d allelic residues were substituted in one or more of the polymorphic regions of the A beta k chain, were used to examine the contribution of each polymorphic region of the molecule to its function. The results obtained demonstrate that the regions between residues 69 to 76 of the A alpha k chain and the regions between residues 63 to 67 and 75 to 78 of the A beta k-chain exert a dominant effect on the presentation of lysozyme peptides by I-Ak to the T cell hybridomas in our panel. These observations were confirmed and extended by the analysis of Ag presentation by seven serologically selected mutants, all of which have amino acid interchanges in or around the dominant polymorphic regions. The results suggest that the serologically selected mutants fail to present Ag not because they fail to bind the peptide Ag but because the amino acid substitutions destabilize the interaction between the Ia/peptide complex and the TCR. Use of the recently published hypothetical model for class II structure to interpret the Ag presentation results suggests that the dominant polymorphic regions lie across from one another near one end of the alpha-helices that form the two walls of the proposed Ag-binding cleft located on the top surface of the class II molecule. Furthermore, the majority of the amino acids which have been changed in the serologically selected mutants have side chains which are postulated to point up toward the exterior of the molecule and would, therefore, be potential contact residues for the TCR.\r"

We used such antibodies to bind hen egg lysozyme (HEL) to various structures on the surface of normal splenic B cells to determine which structures would provide the best targets for enhanced presentation. We found that HEL was presented efficiently to hybridoma T cells if bound to sIgD, sIgM, or class I or II MHC molecules, but not at all if bound to Fc gamma RII, or B220 molecules on B cells. The efficiency of presentation of HEL was measured as a function of the amount of 125I-HEL bound per cell. HEL was presented with 5 to 10 times greater efficiency when bound to sIg, than when bound to MHC molecules. When compared on the basis of the amount of HEL bound, sIgD and sIgM functioned equally as target structures, as did class I and class II MHC molecules. Large amounts of HEL bound to B220, but no presentation resulted, indicating that focusing HEL to the APC surface was not sufficient for presentation to occur. HEL was internalized rapidly and in large amounts when bound to sIgD or sIgM, but slowly and in small amounts, when bound to class I or class II MHC molecules. Thus, a rapid rate of internalization may in part explain the high efficiency of Ag presentation after binding to sIg. However, the small amount of HEL internalized via MHC molecules was utilized efficiently for presentation. These results indicate that sIgM and sIgD serve equally on normal B cells to focus and internalize Ag and enhance Ag presentation, but that class I or class II MHC molecules can also be used to internalize Ag and enhance Ag presentation, perhaps by a separate intracellular processing pathway.\r"

Splenocytes from such mice contain radioresistant cells that profoundly suppress normal lymphocyte function. We now show that GVHD-induced suppressor cells also inhibit the proliferation of CD4+ T cell clones specific for different Ag and class II MHC determinants. These suppressors have a dominant anti-proliferative effect, because they inhibit DNA synthesis in response to receptor-mediated stimulation and growth-promoting lymphokines, without abolishing lymphokine secretion or lymphokine receptor expression by the cloned T cells. The implications of these findings, and the usefulness of T cell clones for studying immune suppression, are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89278681\r", 
  ".W": "Human interstitial retinoid binding protein (HIRBP) is a 136,000 m.w. photoreceptor cell protein which transports retinoids between the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium of the eye. The amino acid sequence of HIRBP suggests that the molecule consists of four continuous homology domains which arose by several gene duplications some 600 to 800 million years ago. When injected into susceptible animal species, including primates, it induces an experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), a predominantly T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the retina and uveal tract of the eye, and the pineal gland. In order to further refine specific sites in HIRBP responsible for its uveitopathogenicity, we synthesized 120 overlapping peptide corresponding to its entire 1262 amino acid sequence, and tested each peptide for its ability to induce an EAU in Lewis rats. Five peptides with extensive amino acid sequence homology, designated HIRBP 715, HIRBP greater than 730 and HIRBP 745, HIRBP 778, and HIRBP 808 were uveitopathogenic when used at a 50 micrograms immunizing dose. The most potent peptide for the induction of EAU was HIRBP 715 (amino acid positions 521 to 540). In dose response studies as little as 0.1 microgram/animal was capable of inducing an inflammatory response. In addition, peptide HIRBP 946 which corresponds to the mid portion of peptide HIRBP 715 and contains only eight amino acids (RTATAAEE) was uveitopathogenic under our experimental conditions. Our study identifies multiple uveitopathogenic sites in HIRBP and further defines the amino acids necessary for the induction of EAU in one of these sites.\r"

  ".W": "We determined if self-reactive T cells are able to escape thymic tolerance in autoimmune New Zealand mice. T cells utilizing V beta 17a and V beta 11 encoded receptors have been shown to be clonally eliminated in nonautoimmune mice expressing I-E because of their potential self-reactivity. Similarly, V beta 8.1+ and V beta 6+ T cells are tolerized in the thymus of nonautoimmune mice that express Mls-1a. These T cell subsets were quantitated in the lymph nodes and spleens of (NZB x NZW)F1 and (NZB x SWR)F1 mice. In young mice from both autoimmune strains, deletion was similar to that observed in control animals matched for I-Ed and Mls-1a expression. Furthermore, older female autoimmune mice with elevated levels of IgG antinuclear antibodies and severe lupus-like renal disease did not demonstrate evidence of a global tolerance defect. We also found that the levels of residual V beta 17a+ cells in MHC-matched control F1 strains were further reduced by up to 80% in autoimmune (NZB x SWR)F1 mice. The greater in vivo elimination corresponded to an enhanced ability of NZB spleen cells, compared with other H-2d spleen cells, to stimulate V beta 17a+ hybridomas in vitro. The increased stimulation in culture could not be attributed to quantitative differences in I-E Ag expression. The results suggest that autoreactive T cells have been eliminated in these autoimmune mice by normal mechanisms of self-tolerance. Furthermore, the data demonstrate the existence of an NZB minor locus not present in other H-2d strains that influences T cell repertoire and enhances stimulation of T cells potentially reactive to self class II MHC Ag.\r"

Replacement of citrate with heparin resulted in accelerated clumping of platelets during storage. Fragmin, a low molecular weight heparin fraction, induced a high degree of platelet clumping, even in the presence of a standard amount of citrate (citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine formula 1 [CPDA-1]) plus PGE-1 and theophylline. The best anticoagulant formulation appeared to be CPDA-1 containing PGE-1 plus theophylline plus aprotinin, plus either hirudin or Thromstop for preservation of platelet responsiveness and structural integrity by in vitro markers. In eight platelet concentrates prepared with these inhibitors and stored for 15 days, the plasma pH was 6.50 +/- 0.15, the PO2 was 94 +/- 29 mm Hg, the PCO2 was 27 +/- 4 mm Hg, and the hypotonic shock response was 76% +/- 25% of the initial value recorded at Day 1 (all values expressed as mean +/- SD). Only 11% +/- 3% of the cellular lactate dehydrogenase was released, 69% +/- 8% of the platelets appeared to be in a discoid shape, and the response to 20 mumol/L adenosine 5'-diphosphate remained at 50% +/- 17% of the initial value. These results were all significantly different (p less than 0.01) from data obtained for concentrates prepared without aprotinin. The use of a factor Xa inhibitor (diamidino-benzofuranyl ethane) in place of Thromstop or hirudin did not provide substantial improvement over controls without inhibitors.\r"

All except two were free from symptoms of peripheral arterial disease. The presence of atheroma was determined according to a standardized consensus procedure based on visual interpretation. Atherosclerosis were graded by means of a scoring system, whereby an overall atherosclerosis score (OAS) was calculated for each patient, based on four consecutive segments of the femoral artery. Thirteen type IIA (72%), 14 type IIB (78%) and 18 type IV (75%) patients had femoral atherosclerosis, and the mean OAS in the patients with hyperlipoproteinaemia of these types were 0.58, 0.75 and 0.49, respectively, all with a standard error of the mean about 0.05. The atherosclerosis score increased the more distal the arterial segment, being most prevalent in the lower inferior segment. The OAS was higher in patients of above median age, in those with systolic or diastolic blood pressure above the median and in smokers. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that low density lipoproteins cholesterol was highly significantly related to OAS among smokers. In conclusion, femoral atherosclerosis is a prevalent finding in asymptomatic subjects with hyperlipoproteinaemia and could serve as a basis for intervention studies.\r"

Their 71 control subjects were matched according to age, sex, smoking, relative weight, and absence of CAD. The concentrations of fatty acids, 14:0, 16:0 and 16:1 of the serum phospholipids, were significantly (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively) higher in CAD patients than in the controls. On the other hand, linoleic (18:2 omega 6), linolenic (18:3 omega 3) and arachidonic (20:4 omega 6) acids were at a significantly lower level in the patients when compared to the controls. The polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids (P/S) ratio in serum phospholipids was significantly (P less than 0.01) lower in the patients than in the controls. In the cholesteryl ester fraction the results paralleled those of the phospholipids. Significant correlations were obtained between the polyunsaturated fatty acids and the high density lipoprotein cholesterol or apolipoprotein A-I in the control subjects but most of these correlations were absent in the patients. Our present results further support the importance of linoleic acid in the protection against atherosclerosis. However, no unequivocal evidence on the possible beneficial effect of long-chain omega 3-fatty acids in comparison with omega 6-acids was obtained.\r"

The clinical syndromes of the VZV-associated diseases comprised meningo-encephalitis, myelitis, myelopathies and polyneuropathies, mostly with a favourable outcome. A characteristic finding was an intrathecal synthesis of VZV IgG1 and HSV-3. Commonly also IgG2 and 4 were seen in CSF of VZV patients. Their intrathecally synthesised HSV IgG was restricted to IgG1. VZV IgG3 occurred in serum and/or CFS together with VZV IgM in 14 cases and may be a marker of recent VZV replication. In patients with HSV-associated neurological disease, a multi-IgG subclass HSV response and concomitant VZV antibodies restricted to IgG1 was found. Intrathecal synthesis of both HSV and VZV IgG occurred in 20 patients. Detection of two or more VZV or HSV specific IgG subclasses synthesised intrathecally identified the aetiological agent in 19 of these 20 cases.\r"

There was significant inverse association between height change and change in the level of HDL-C in black males, while there was significant inverse association between height change and change in the level of LDL-C in white males. These associations were independent of age, sexual maturation, and weight. Thus, changes in levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins in males during adolescence are partly associated with the growth spurt in height.\r"

We illustrate a risk adjustment approach to evaluating institutional performance for PCP using a pilot data set from two Southern California hospitals differing widely in crude PCP death rates (61 vs 27%). Using admission AaDO2, hemoglobin and age in a logistic prediction model for hospital death, we found that outcomes in 90% of cases could be accurately classified. Nearly all of the \"excess\" mortality of the poor outcome hospital could be explained by greater pulmonary severity on admission. We discuss four conceptual issues in design of AIDS quality-of-care studies: confounding by therapeutic intention, defining relevant treatment components, determining the range of co-morbidity, and truncation of the episode of care.\r"

Minimal amounts of MPP+, which has low octanol/water partition coefficient, crossed the blood-brain barrier. MPTP and butanol, both of which have high octanol/water partition coefficients, were almost completely extracted by all regions of the brain on the first pass. The main difference between the MPTP and butanol tracers is that butanol rapidly left the brain with an exponential rate constant of 1.24 min-1, whereas MPTP was avidly retained by the brain with a washout rate constant of 0.10 min-1 (mean values for the four brain regions that we studied). Early retention of MPTP by the brain was not due to its rapid metabolism by monoamine oxidase because pargyline pretreatment did not affect this rate constant. However, 30 min after [3H]MPTP injection, brain retention of the 3H tracer was reduced significantly by pargyline treatment, and the ratio of brain MPTP/MPP+ was increased markedly.\r"

These responses were elicited with frequencies as low as 1.0 Hz and with pulse durations as low as 100 microseconds. The magnitude of the contractile response increased with increasing frequency of stimulation. Blockade of adrenergic neuronal mechanisms with guanethidine (5 x 10(-6) M) increased the size of the contractile responses at 10 Hz and they were antagonized markedly by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (4.3 or 8.6 x 10(-7) M), but not by the adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (3.6 x 10(-7) M). Contractions to field stimulation were increased greatly by the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (1.1 x 10(-6) M). Blockade of neuronal sodium channels with tetrodotoxin (9.4 x 10(-7) M) reduced severely the contractions to field stimulation, as did cold storage of coronary vessels for 5 or 6 days. The contractile responses to stimulation were not inhibited significantly by antagonists of prostaglandin synthesis, or were they enhanced by denudation of the endothelium. It is concluded that cholinergic constrictor mechanisms, linked to medial muscarinic receptors, operate in the large coronary arteries, which are associated in humans with coronary spasm.\r"

Average firing rate, firing rate distribution and the incidence of spontaneous activity (cells per electrode track) did not change in either region as a function of age. Next, the inhibitory effects of several DA agonists on the firing rates of antidromically identified nigrostriatal DA cells were compared in young and old rats. The inhibitory potencies of i.v. apomorphine (D1/D2 agonist), quinpirole (D2 agonist) and d-amphetamine (indirect agonist) did not change with age. Similarly, the inhibitory effects of microiontophoretically applied dopamine were unaltered in aged rats. Stimulation of the sciatic nerve resulted in brief periods of inhibition of the activity of nigrostriatal DA neurons in both the young and the old age groups. The duration of this inhibitory response was, however, enhanced markedly in the old rats. The D1 agonist SKF 38393 enhanced the duration of the inhibitory effect of sciatic nerve stimulation in both young and old rats. These results suggest that, although no gross differences in the activity of DA cells in young and old rats were evident, subtle changes in the regulation of the activity of these neurons may occur with age.\r"

  ".W": "Several analogs of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were synthesized and compared to MPTP for their ability to be oxidized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and for their ability to cause nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice. Most of the compounds were oxidized by mouse brain MAO, either predominantly by the B-form or by both the A- and B-forms. The MAO-catalyzed oxidation of all of the MAO substrates resulted in the formation of dihydropyridinium intermediates which, in turn, except for the dihydropyridinium of 1-methyl-4-benzyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, formed pyridinium species as the final oxidation product. Nine analogs were found to be neurotoxic; all were oxidized by MAO to pyridinium compounds. However, some non-neurotoxic MPTP analogs were also oxidized by MAO. Neither 1-methyl-4-benzyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine nor the compounds which were not substrates for MAO were neurotoxic. Also, the neurotoxicity of all of the compounds tested was blocked by inhibiting either MAO-B, MAO-A or both MAO-B and MAO-A together, indicating that MAO activity was necessary for the neurotoxicity of the compounds to be manifested. The capacity of an MPTP analog to be oxidized by MAO to a pyridinium appears to be a necessary, but not sufficient, parameter in determining the neurotoxic potential of the compound.\r"

We reported that most of the analogs were oxidized by MAO to pyridiniums and some of the analogs were neurotoxic. We concluded that the capacity of a tetrahydropyridine MPTP analog to be oxidized by MAO to a pyridinium was a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the compound to be a neurotoxin. In the present paper we attempt to explain further the neurotoxicity or lack of neurotoxicity of these analogs by evaluating the abilities of the pyridinium compounds to serve as substrates for the neostriatal dopamine (DA) transport system and as inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration. We now report that all of the neurotoxic MPTP analogs are oxidized to pyridiniums that are good substrates for the neostriatal DA carrier and good inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration. The results are consistent with an important role for both uptake of the pyridiniums by the DA carrier and inhibition by the pyridiniums of mitochondrial respiration in the neurotoxicity induced by MPTP and its analogs.\r"

The radiation responses studied included recovery from potentially lethal damage (PLDR) and recovery from sublethal damage (SLDR). The presence of EGF in the cell culture either after irradiation (during the clonogenic assay period) or continuously before, during, and after irradiation enhanced the radiosensitivity of the cells and reduced their plating efficiency (PE). However, these effects were not as great when EGF was present in the cell culture only before and during irradiation. This enhancement of radiosensitivity was associated with a reduction in the shoulder region of the cell survival curves. The PE reduction and radiosensitivity enhancement were maximum with 10 ng of EGF/mL. However, EGF present continuously in the cell culture, including during the 6-hour repair period, had no effect on cellular PLDR or SLDR. The single-stranded DNA breaks present in large numbers in cells immediately after irradiation returned to control levels by 6 hours. Moreover, EGF present in cell cultures for the 48 hours before irradiation and during the 6-hour repair period had no effect on the DNA alkaline elution profiles of either control or irradiated cells. EGF did not affect the growth of unirradiated cells; however, it extended the lag-phase period for growth of irradiated cells. In summary, this EGF-induced radiosensitivity enhancement was not correlated with the effects of EGF on PE, cell growth, PLDR, or SLDR.\r"

The non-reproductive system cancers were divided into two classes: class I, which included cancers of the digestive system, thyroid, bladder, lung, and other sites and hematopoietic cancers (lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma, and Hodgkin's disease), and class II, which included skin cancers and cutaneous melanoma. The former college athletes had a significantly lower prevalence of class I cancers compared to the nonathletes; the age-adjusted relative risk (RR) equals 3.34, 95% confidence limits (1.35, 8.33), P = 0.009. In contrast, the prevalence rates of malignant melanomas and skin cancers did not differ significantly between the former athletes and nonathletes. The age-adjusted RR did not differ from 1.0. The lower prevalence rate of class I cancers among the former athletes is in accord with previous findings of a significantly lower prevalence rate of breast cancer and cancers of the reproductive system among former college athletes compared to nonathletes.\r"

To obtain an improved estimate of the distribution of HSV-2 infection in the United States, we used an HSV type-specific antibody assay to test serum samples from 4201 participants in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The results in our sample indicate that in the period from 1976 to 1980, 16.4 percent of the U.S. population 15 to 74 years of age (approximately 25 million persons) was infected with HSV-2 (95 percent confidence interval, 14.2 to 18.6 percent). Age and race were the demographic factors associated most strongly with the presence of HSV-2 antibody. The prevalence of the antibody increased from less than 1 percent in the group under 15 years old to 20.2 percent in the group 30 to 44 years old; it increased only slightly thereafter. In the oldest group, 60 to 74 years of age, the prevalence was 19.7 percent in whites and 64.7 percent in blacks. Among blacks of all age groups, but not whites, higher rates were observed in women than in men. The associations were weaker with respect to marital status, income, education, urban residence, and region of the country. After control for age, sex, and race, only the association with marital status remained significant; the rate was increased in persons previously married--i.e., divorced, separated, or widowed. We conclude that the prevalence of HSV-2 infection in the United States is higher than has previously been recognized and that many infections with this sexually transmitted virus may be subclinical.\r"

  ".W": "The majority of T cells bear the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta complex which recognizes foreign antigen peptides only in the context of self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Such T cells function in a variety of effector roles and secrete cytokines that mediate the activation and differentiation of other cells in the immune system. Recently, a small subpopulation T cells was found to bear a distinct TCR composed of gamma and delta subunits. In man, TCR gamma delta+ cells are distributed as approximately 5 per cent of the CD3+ cells in all organized lymphoid organs as well as in the skin- and gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Although a limited number of germ-line genes encode the TCR gamma and delta subunits, extensive junctional variation particularly in the delta gene, results in unprecedented diversity for this receptor. The nature of the specificity and immunological functions of these T cells remains enigmatic. We report here that in contrast to the normal low frequency of gamma delta-bearing cells in lymphoid tissues, peripheral blood, or normal skin, the frequency is increased five to eightfold in particular granulomatous reactions of leprosy. TCR gamma delta+ lymphocyte lines from these leprosy skin lesions proliferate in vitro specifically to mycobacterial antigens. This reactivity to foreign antigens appears to require presentation in the context of self-molecules. Moreover, culture supernatants from activated gamma delta T lymphocytes induce adhesion and aggregation of bone-marrow monocytes in the presence of granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (CSF), suggesting that products of gamma delta-bearing T cells may play a role in the immune response, possibly by stimulating granuloma formation.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions of CD4 with the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are crucial during thymic ontogeny and subsequently for helper and cytotoxic functions of CD4+CD8- T lymphocytes. CD4 is the receptor for the T-lymphotropic human immunodeficiency virus and binds its envelope glycoprotein, gp120. The residues involved in gp120 binding have been localized to a region within the immunoglobulin-like domain I of CD4, which corresponds to CDR2 of an immunoglobulin variable region, but the CD4 residues important in MHC class II interaction have not been characterized. Here, using a cell-binding assay dependent specifically on the CD4-MHC class II association, we analyse the effects of mutations in CD4 on class II versus gp120 binding. Mutations in CDR2 that destroy gp120 binding affect CD4-MHC class II binding similarly. In addition, binding of soluble gp120 to CD4-transfected cells abrogates their ability to interact with class II-bearing B lymphocytes. In contrast, other mutations within domains I or II that have no effect on gp120 binding eliminate or substantially decrease class II interaction. Thus, the CD4 binding site for class II MHC is more complex than the gp120 binding site, possibly reflecting a broader area of contact with the former ligand and a requirement for appropriate juxtaposition of the two N-terminal domains. The ability of gp120 to inhibit the binding of class II MHC to CD4 could be important in disrupting normal T-cell physiology, acting both to inhibit immune responses and to prevent differentiation of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into CD4+CD8- T lymphocytes.\r"

Activation signals generated by antigen binding to the antigen-specific alpha/beta heterodimer (Ti) are thought to be transduced via the invariant CD3 gamma, epsilon and delta chains, and the associated zeta and eta subunits. The physiological role of the interaction of CD2 with its homologous cell-surface associated ligand LFA-3 remains to be fully elucidated. It has been suggested that CD2 regulates an antigen-independent pathway of activation or that signals delivered via CD2 are an integral part of the antigen-specific pathway. Several recent studies have indicated a requirement for the Ti-CD3 complex in CD2 signalling. Thus, mutant T-cell lines expressing CD2, but not Ti-CD3, on the cell surface cannot be activated via the CD2 molecules. Functional interaction between the Ti-CD3 complex and the CD2 antigen suggests that these T-lymphocyte cell-surface structures are physically associated. Here we use a digitonin-based solubilization procedure to explore this possibility and show that 40% of the cell-surface CD2 molecules can be specifically co-precipitated in association with the Ti-CD3 complex.\r"

It has since become clear that glucocorticoid hormones are critically involved in the regulation of immunity. The level of glucocorticoids secreted in response to antigenic challenge corresponds to the magnitude of the immune response and in general reaches immunosuppressive levels. Interestingly, not all immune responses enhance ACTH and glucocorticoid hormone production. In transplantation immunity, the reverse seems to be true: circulating glucocorticoid levels at the time of skin graft rejection are lower than control levels. Because beta-endorphin and ACTH originate from the same prohormone, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and are closely related in their tissue-specific processing and coordinate release, we have investigated the role of pituitary beta-endorphin in transplantation immunity. We report here that POMC biosynthesis and processing in the pars intermedia, but not in the anterior pituitary, can be regulated by T cell-specific factors secreted in animals undergoing transplantation immunity.\r"

  ".W": "Although convincing evidence has been obtained for the imposition of self-tolerance by the intrathymic deletion of self-reactive T cells, the development of tolerance to antigens which are expressed only in the periphery is not so well understood. We have approached this question by creating transgenic mice which carry a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene (H-2Kb) linked to the rat insulin promoter. Mice expressing the transgene develop diabetes, but do not appear to mount an immune response against the transgene-expressing pancreatic beta-cells, even when the transgene is allogeneic with respect to the endogenous host H-2 antigens. We have now explored the mechanism of this tolerance further. We find that spleen cells from pre-diabetic transgenic (RIP-Kb) mice do not kill targets bearing H-2Kb, whereas thymus cells from the same mice do. The unresponsiveness of these spleen cells can be reversed in vitro by providing recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). In older, diabetic mice, responsiveness develops as the pancreatic beta-cells are lost. Our results point to an extrathymic mechanism of tolerance induction, dependent on the continuous presence of antigen and the lack of IL-2 in the local environment of potentially reactive T cells.\r"

The drug cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to interfere with this process, allowing the escape of normally 'forbidden' T-cell clones and the appearance of autoimmune disease. Recently, it has been demonstrated that immature thymocytes undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) upon activation via the T-cell receptor. A similar phenomenon of activation-induced cell death (AICD) has been observed in T-cell hybridomas. Here we show that AICD in T-cell hybridomas in vitro and in thymocytes in vivo is blocked by CsA. Thus, clonal deletion may involve AICD when self-reactive, immature T cells are induced by self antigen, and CsA may cause autoimmunity by interfering with this process.\r"

By transfecting mouse histone gene constructs into Chinese hamster ovary cells, we have identified a 110-nucleotide region within the coding sequence of the H3.2-614 gene that is required for high-level expression. Deletion of this region reduces expression of the gene by 20-fold. Additionally, the histone-coding region activates the human alpha-globin promoter, which is normally not expressed well in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Similar results with deletion constructions involving the H2a-614 gene suggest that an intragenic region plays an important role in transcription of these genes.\r"

As this protein may represent a marker for bone activity in human disease, we examined the regulation of its expression at the molecular level by evaluating human osteocalcin gene promoter function. We describe regions within the promoter that contribute to basal expression of the gene in osteoblast-like cells in culture. Further, we define a 21-base-pair DNA element with the sequence 5'-GTGACTCACCGGGTGAACGGG-3', which acts in cis to mediate 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inducibility of the osteocalcin gene. This response element bears sequence similarity with other short DNA segments, particularly those for estrogen and thyroid hormone, which act together with their respective trans-acting receptors to modulate gene transcription.\r"

This was due to loss of high-affinity EGF binding sites. The modulation was associated with transient increases in inositol phosphate synthesis and intracellular Ca2+ and with phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on serine and threonine. There was no evidence for entry of labeled ATP into the cells. ATP appeared to bind to specific cell surface receptors. Such binding was demonstrated directly with the nonmetabolizable ATP analogue adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate.\r"

The present study was done to determine if transfection with DNA of HSV-2 can induce carcinogenesis in this animal model. Genomic HSV-2 DNA was isolated from infected HEp-2 cells and separated from host cell DNA by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The DNA was applied to mouse cervix for periods of 80-100 weeks. Experimental controls were treated with uninfected genomic HEp-2 cell DNA or with calf thymus DNA. Vaginal cytological preparations from all animals were examined monthly to detect epithelial abnormalities. Animals were sacrificed and histopathology studies were done when cellular changes indicative of premalignant or malignant lesions were seen on vaginal smears. Cytologic and histologic materials were coded and evaluated without knowledge of whether they were from animals treated with virus or control DNA. Premalignant and malignant cervical lesions similar to those that occur in women were detected in 61% of the histologic specimens obtained from animals exposed to HSV-2 DNA. The yield of invasive cancers was 21% in animals treated with HSV-2 DNA. No cancers were detected in mice treated with either HEp-2 or calf thymus DNA. Dysplasia was detected in only one of these control animals.\r"

(ii) Depletion of both CD4+ T cells and B cells prevented the generation of anti-influenza Tc cell responses, whereas depletion of either CD4+ T cells or B cells alone failed to do so. In addition, supplementation of unprimed B cells restored the Tc cell responsiveness of primed splenocytes that had been depleted of both CD4+ T cells and B cells. (iii) Contact between T and B cells was not obligatory for the delivery of B-cell helper signal, and hence help was mediated by a soluble factor(s).

Ia binding and Ia-restricted T-cell immunogenicity could be determined for a total of 54 peptide-MHC combinations. Only 30% of the 54 instances examined involved detectable Ia binding, but they represented almost all (12 of 13) of the immune responses found. However, binding to Ia was not sufficient to ensure T-cell immunogenicity, since only 70% of the binding events were productive--i.e., were associated with an immune response. Thus, Ia molecules have the expected characteristics of a highly permissive capacity for antigen interaction that allows them to function as restriction elements for a large universe of antigens. On the other hand, since the Ia molecules cannot distinguish between self and non-self, not all antigen-Ia interactions would be permitted to elicit a T-cell response. It appears that both Ia binding (\"determinant selection\") and T-cell repertoire act in concert to define the immune response status of an individual toward any particular T-cell epitope.\r"

Epitope 1-affinity-purified antibodies from different patients react with either (i) the A protein exclusively; (ii) proteins A, B'/B, a synthetic peptide for part of the N polypeptide, and an unidentified protein with a molecular mass of 50 kDa; or (iii) proteins A, B'/B, C, and the N-derived peptide. Comparison of the primary structures of proteins B'/B, N, and C reveals multiple epitope 1-like sequences in all of them.

  ".U": "89282834\r", 
  ".W": "The anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) B-cell repertoire of unimmunized adult mice was examined by culture of splenocytes (generally 100-3000) at limiting dilution. Cells were polyclonally stimulated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and an interleukin-4-containing lymphokine mixture in the presence of 3T3 fibroblast filler cells. After 7 days of culture, supernatants were examined for their content of anti-KLH IgM and IgG1 antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Parallel cultures of smaller numbers (generally 1-15) of splenocytes were examined to determine the cloning efficiency of B cells in terms of total IgM and IgG1 production. Whereas one spleen cell in 370 produced clones secreting anti-KLH IgM, only 1% of these produced IgG1 that could bind to KLH, despite the fact that about half of the clones switched to IgG1 production with these stimuli. In mice immunized with KLH, this situation did not change until day 5, when there was a sudden, explosive emergence of B cells that could form clones secreting anti-KLH IgG1. The absolute number of such cells in the spleen was found to rise by a factor of 350 between days 3 and 7 of immunization. Moreover, the median amount of IgG1 antibody formed per clone and binding to KLH also rose markedly. In contrast, neither the numbers nor the median KLH-binding antibody content of anti-KLH IgM clones changed significantly after immunization. The results show that the repertoire of anti-protein B cells detected through IgM formation in ELISA consists chiefly of cells producing antibody of low avidity and of doubtful in vivo significance. Assuming that the small proportion of these cells making antibody that is of sufficient avidity to bind as the IgG1 isotype are the ancestors of the many such cells found on day 7 of the primary immune response, one would have to postulate a very high recruitment and/or division rate to account for the increase in numbers and avidity that occurs. It is possible that the anti-KLH IgG1 precursors that suddenly emerge are the results of early variable region gene (V) mutations in B cells. Moreover, it is not excluded that they represent products of a subset of B cells different from those that give rise to the primary in vitro anti-KLH IgM response. The findings have implications for theories of B-cell tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "Herpes simplex virus infection of mammalian hosts involves lytic replication at a primary site, such as the cornea, translocation by axonal transport to sensory ganglia and replication, and latent infection at a secondary site, ganglionic neurons. The virus-encoded thymidine kinase, which is a target for antiviral drugs such as acyclovir, is not essential for lytic replication yet evidently is required at the secondary site for replication and some phase of latent infection. To determine the specific stage in viral pathogenesis at which this enzyme is required, we constructed virus deletion mutants that were acyclovir resistant and exhibited no detectable thymidine kinase activity. After corneal inoculation of mice, the mutants replicated to high titers in the eye but were severely impaired for acute replication in trigeminal ganglia and failed to reactivate from ganglia upon cocultivation with permissive cells. Nevertheless, latency-associated transcripts were expressed in neuronal nuclei of ganglia from mutant-infected mice and superinfection of the ganglia with a second virus rescued the latent mutant virus. Thus, contrary to a widely accepted hypothesis, the thymidine kinase-negative mutants established latent infections, implying that neither thymidine kinase activity nor ganglionic replication is necessary for establishment of latency. Rather, thymidine kinase appears to be necessary for reactivation from latency. These results suggest that acyclovir-resistant viruses could establish latent infections in clinical settings and have implications for the use of genetically engineered herpesviruses to deliver foreign genes to neurons.\r"

  ".U": "89282852\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently found that susceptibility to streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced arthritis in Lewis (LEW/N) rats is due, in part, to defective inflammatory and stress mediator-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Conversely, the relative arthritis resistance of histocompatible Fischer (F344/N) rats is related to their intact responses to the same stimuli. Specifically, LEW/N rats, in contrast to F344/N rats, have markedly impaired plasma corticotropin and corticosterone responses to SCW, recombinant human interleukin 1 alpha, the serotonin agonist quipazine, or synthetic rat/human corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). To explore the mechanism of this defect, we examined the functional integrity of the hypothalamic CRH neuron in LEW/N rats compared to F344/N rats. LEW/N rats, in contrast to F344/N rats, showed profoundly deficient paraventricular nucleus CRH mRNA levels and hypothalamic CRH content in response to SCW. Compared to F344/N rats, there was no increase in LEW/N hypothalamic CRH content or CRH release from explanted LEW/N hypothalami in organ culture in response to recombinant interleukin 1 alpha. These data provide strong evidence that the defective LEW/N corticotropin and corticosterone responses to inflammatory and other stress mediators, and the LEW/N susceptibility to experimental arthritis, are due in part to a hypothalamic defect in the synthesis and secretion of CRH. The additional finding of deficient expression in LEW/N rats of the hypothalamic enkephalin gene, which is coordinately regulated with the CRH gene in response to stress, suggests that the primary defect is not in the CRH gene but is instead related to its inappropriate regulation.\r"

Histologically, experimental extremities demonstrated greater osteoblast, osteocyte, and muscle cell survival in replanted hindlimbs with patent vascular anastomoses.

These findings raise serious concern for the development of a safe vaccine against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. To address the in vivo relevance and mechanism of this phenomenon, antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV infectivity in peripheral blood macrophages, lymphocytes, and human fibroblastoid cells was studied. Neither Leu3a, a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD4 receptor, nor soluble recombinant CD4 even at high concentrations prevented this enhancement. The addition of monoclonal antibody to the Fc receptor III (anti-FcRIII), but not of antibodies that react with FcRI or FcRII, inhibited HIV type 1 and HIV type 2 enhancement in peripheral blood macrophages. Although enhancement of HIV infection in CD4+ lymphocytes could not be blocked by anti-FcRIII, it was inhibited by the addition of human immunoglobulin G aggregates. The results indicate that the FcRIII receptor on human macrophages and possibly another Fc receptor on human CD4+ lymphocytes mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of HIV infectivity and that this phenomenon proceeds through a mechanism independent of the CD4 protein.\r"

Results of in vitro assays showed acceptable storage values regardless of the ABO types in the pool. Pool pH on Day 5 was 6.83 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- 1 SD). The in vitro storage characteristics were comparable to those of unpooled age-matched platelets reported previously from our laboratory. For in vivo studies, 4-unit pools of ABO-compatible random-donor PCs stored for up to 96 hours in 1000-ml PL-732 bags were transfused into patients who were thrombocytopenic due to bone marrow failure, and the correct count increments (CCI) were determined.

The possibility of whether the activation of granulocytes and the subsequent release reactions, which may have been triggered by this extracorporeal circuit, were responsible for these adverse effects was evaluated. Six blood samples were obtained at set intervals during cytapheresis. Of these samples, four were taken directly from the donor. The remaining two were drawn from the efferent lines, i.e., those which return blood from the cytapheresis machine to the donor. Reactive oxygen species produced by granulocytes were measured by chemiluminescence (CL) using microamounts of whole blood or isolated granulocytes. Furthermore, secreted granulocyte products such as neutral proteinase elastase, which is present in plasma in a complex with alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (E-alpha-1-PI), and lysosomal beta-glucuronidase were examined. A complete blood cell count and the values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, lactate dehydrogenase, protein, albumin, and proteinase inhibitors such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor were also determined. Clinical chemical and cytologic values, with the exception of those for E-alpha-1-PI, were 10 to 17 percent lower than values before apheresis. These results can be attributed to inherent plasma volume expansion. Reduced CL was observed on the stimulation of phagocytes in the whole blood assay, as well as with stimulated granulocytes. Unstimulated granulocytes, on the other hand, showed an increased native CL. These data do not indicate a cytapheresis-mediated activation of the oxidative metabolism of granulocytes, and the concomitant discharge of proteolytic enzymes remains, therefore, of no clinical importance.\r"

Graft recanalization was achieved in eight (80%) of 10 grafts, although only six (60%) of 10 grafts were widely patent at the end of the procedure. All successfully recanalized grafts required balloon angioplasty of underlying stenoses. No complications, specifically myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident, were encountered. We have shown that occluded aortocoronary bypass grafts can be recanalized successfully by using a short-duration, high-dose urokinase infusion. It appears that, with attention given to angiographic techniques that minimize clot manipulation, recanalization can be accomplished safely in a majority of cases.\r"

  ".W": "Sucralfate exhibits gastroprotective properties in laboratory animals and enhances the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcers, but the mechanisms of these actions have not been entirely elucidated. The present study was designed to determine whether or not epidermal growth factor (EGF), which also has gastroprotective and ulcer-healing properties, contributes to the action of sucralfate in rat stomach. It was confirmed that sucralfate, like 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, protects the gastric mucosa against ethanol damage and increases mucosal generation of prostaglandins. Removal of the endogenous source of EGF (sialoadenectomy) did not abolish the protective and prostaglandin-stimulating effects of sucralfate. Exogenous EGF and 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 were also protective in rats with intact and removed salivary glands. Sucralfate, like EGF, enhanced the healing of chronic gastric and duodenal ulcerations induced by serosal application of acetic acid. Sucralfate was found to bind EGF in a pH-dependent manner and to accumulate it in ulcer areas. Thus, the peptide is available locally in high concentrations to accelerate tissue repair and the healing process in ulcerated mucosa. The ulcer-healing effects of sucralfate were reduced with sialoadenectomy and partially restored with oral administration of EGF. It was concluded that EGF is not essential for the gastroprotection induced by sucralfate, but seems to play an important role in the ulcer-healing action of this drug.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two long-term ventilated patients were randomly selected for a study of the efficacy of sucralfate (1 g six times per day via gastric tube) versus ranitidine (six 50-mg to six 100-mg doses per day intravenously) for the prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patients of the two treatment groups (each 16) were comparable with respect to diseases precipitating acute respiratory failure and risk factors of bleeding, e.g., renal failure, thrombopenia, coagulopathy, and anticoagulant treatment. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 7.4 in sucralfate- and 7.7 days in ranitidine-treated patients. During mechanical ventilation, macroscopically visible bleeding developed in three of the sucralfate-treated (18.7 percent) and seven of the ranitidine-treated (43.7 percent) patients. Until the end of the study, only three of the sucralfate-treated but nine of the ranitidine-treated (56.2 percent) patients bled; the difference between the two treatment groups was at all times significant (p less than 0.05). Packed red blood cells had to be administered to the three bleeding patients in the sucralfate group and to seven bleeding in the ranitidine group. Therefore it seems that sucralfate prevented mostly minor bleeding. The high bleeding rate during ranitidine treatment was presumably due to the high number of pH-nonresponders, as almost 30 percent of the gastric aspirates of this group had a pH less than 5. During treatment no difference was found in positive blood culture specimens and bronchial secretions between the two groups. However, nosocomial pneumonia developed in two ranitidine-treated patients, whereas that complication developed in none of the sucralfate-treated patients. In long-term ventilated patients, sucralfate prevented minor upper gastrointestinal bleeding significantly better than ranitidine. However, this does not imply that major upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be prevented by either sucralfate or ranitidine in these patients.\r"

To answer this question, it is clear that local prevalence data of seropositivity must be known. At present, these figures are unavailable for midwestern metropolitan areas such as ours. Therefore an obstetric human immunodeficiency virus screening committee was formed to determine the prevalence of seropositivity of this virus in our obstetric clinic population. During a 14-month period of time all patients registering for prenatal care were offered human immunodeficiency virus antibody testing. A total of 585 out of 751 patients (78%) gave informed consent. Forty-two of these patients had risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection. The rate of seropositivity in this group was 7.1% (3 of 42). The remaining 543 patients had no risk factors and none of these patients had positive test results. From our preliminary results, screening only those prenatal patients with identified risk factors appears to be justified.\r"

When MH was triggered the animals were treated with dantrolene. Mean onset time of malignant hyperthermia on exposure to halothane alone was 7.2 min +/- 3.0 min and onset with propofol and halothane was 5.0 +/- 2.5 min. In no instance did propofol alone trigger the syndrome nor was there a statistical difference (P less than 0.05) in onset time when the drug was used in conjunction with halothane. On the basis of these results, we conclude that propofol is almost certainly safe for use in humans who are susceptible to MH.\r"

If metyrapone was given during the time of day when hypothalamic pituitary adrenal activity was otherwise low, the relative increase in the corticotropin concentration was small. Pituitary response to exogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone can be defined under conditions in which the amount of glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback present at the level of the pituitary gland is equal in all subjects. When the ambient cortisol level was equalized (and suppressed) in all subjects at the time of study with a threshold dosage of corticotropin-releasing hormone, we found an augmented response to corticotropin-releasing hormone in depressives. This raises the possibility that either increased pituitary sensitivity to corticotropin-releasing hormone or an increased intracellular pool of corticotropin is available for release in subjects with major depressive illness.\r"

Previous studies have suggested that it may, in fact, not be derived from the random nucleolysis that might be expected to accompany cell death, which might have been the simplest explanation of its origin. To extend the results of other studies, plasma DNA, obtained from a subgroup of SLE patients who had large amounts of immunoprecipitable plasma DNA, was cloned into a plasmid vector, and the nucleotide base sequences were studied by nucleic acid hybridization. One possible explanation for the anomalous renaturation kinetics of plasma DNA in SLE--namely, that it contained non-human genomic base sequences--was rendered untenable by the fact that 51 consecutive DNA clones from 2 SLE patients were each shown to contain human genomic DNA sequences. Plasma DNA from SLE patients also differed from human genomic control DNA in that those sequences derived from the highly repetitive fraction of human DNA were specifically enriched in one such sequence, Alu, which constituted 55% of the repeat sequences in the plasma DNA clones as compared with 13% in control DNA clones. There was a decrease in the frequency of non-Alu repeat sequences (9% for plasma DNA compared with 23% in control DNA). These differences were statistically significant, and they indicate that SLE plasma DNA contains a nonrandom selection of human genomic base sequences. Several explanations for these findings are considered.\r"

Placing these variables in a logistic regression model left two variables that significantly explained the variance of the model: pulse (odds-risk ratio, 1.032/increase in pulse of 1 from 0; 95% confidence interval, 1.020 to 1.039) and mouth breathing (odds-risk ratio, 2.113; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 3.43). There was poor linear correlation between oral and rectal temperatures (r = 0.2). If a patient has an unexplained tachycardia and/or is breathing by mouth and is afebrile orally, a rectal temperature measurement should be obtained to determine if fever exists. The results of this study suggest that good linear correlation does not exist between oral and rectal temperature measurements.\r"

Computed tomographic findings could also be used to enhance local treatment by guiding surgical biopsy and curettage procedures or defining low-dose radiation therapy portals. Eleven of these 18 children with otologic Langerhans' cell histiocytosis additionally required chemotherapy due to the systemic nature of their disease.\r"

LoVo cells were exposed to ADR (0.4 micrograms/ml) for various time intervals and then tested for sensitivity to lysis by NK cells from the peripheral blood of normal donors in a sodium chromate (Cr51) release cytotoxicity assay. Exposure of tumor targets to ADR induced a resistance to NK-mediated lysis. Susceptibility to lysis decreased progressively to approximately 60% of control levels after 72 hours of ADR exposure. The induction of resistance was dependent on ADR dose, but did not magnify with doses greater than 0.4 micrograms/ml. When target cells were allowed to recover from ADR in fresh medium for 48 hours, complete reversal of the ADR effect was seen. The effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation on the NK lysis of LoVo also was tested. IL-2-stimulated effector cells demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity to LoVo targets and were able to overcome the ADR-induced resistance to lysis. The mechanism of resistance does not appear to be related to the altered binding of effectors to chemotherapy-treated targets, as suggested by single cell assay results.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed to study the cellular mechanism of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) on vascular smooth muscle. Rat femoral arteries were cannulated and pressurized to 100 mm Hg. Vascular smooth muscle membrane potential (Em) and diameter responses to perfusion with 5 x 10(-6) M acetylcholine (ACh) were measured in vessels precontracted with 5 x 10(-6) M norepinephrine (NE). Hyperpolarization (-35 +/- 1.2 to -66 +/- 2.0 mV) and dilation were observed during ACh administration. Both responses were abolished on removal of the endothelium with collagenase. A bioassay was developed in which two vessel segments from the same artery were connected in series. The downstream vessel was deendothelialized while the endothelium of the upstream vessel remained intact. The protocol used was the same as in the first set of measurements. Hyperpolarization and dilation were observed in both vessels during ACh perfusion. However, when the direction of the perfusate flow in the bioassay system was reversed so that the deendothelialized vessel was upstream, only the \"endothelium-intact\" vessel demonstrated vascular smooth muscle hyperpolarization. To examine the ionic mechanism underlying the hyperpolarization presumably by released EDRF, the Em was measured as a function of increasing extracellular potassium ([K+]o). In the presence of ACh (but not NE) the maximum depolarization produced by a decade increase of [K+]o (10-100 mM) was 50 mV. In the deendothelialized vessel, this depolarization was decreased significantly to 39 mV. Addition to the superfusate of 10 mM tetraethylammonium, a K+ channel blocker, significantly reduced the hyperpolarization caused by ACh-induced EDRF release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anti-B cell autoimmunity may encompass reactivity against HLA-class 2 molecules, which are also expressed on kidney tissue. We studied 15 patients with moderate to severe renal involvement and 5 lupus patients with no clinical renal disease, in order to detect the presence of anti-HLA class 2 AAb. Flow cytometry was employed in an inhibitory assay using patient sera, autologous cells and two anti-class 2 monoclonals, to establish the specificity of anti-B cell AAb. Seven out of 15 nephritis patients had detectable anti-class 2 AAb with an epitopic heterogeneity, as demonstrated by different degrees of inhibition on the binding of non-overlapping monoclonals. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by the lack of inhibition of non-class 2 antibody binding. The presence of such AAb was not correlated with disease activity but with the presence of a diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy. Anti-class 2 AAb may be a marker of SLE diffuse proliferative nephritis.\r"

Results showed restriction in five of 45 and reticulonodular opacities in 16 of 45 workers. Squamous metaplasia and other histopathologic changes were observed, although silicotic nodules were absent by TBB. Lung lead levels above those of control subjects were observed in four of five lead miners. These findings show that lead miners are at risk for lung disease. Although silica is a likely cause, elevated lung lead content found in these miners merits further investigation.\r"

Pretreatment of the cells for 48 h with IL-1 reduced intra- and extracellular cAMP accumulation in response to LH by 73% and 83%, respectively. The inhibitory effects of IL-1 were time and concentration dependent. Significant inhibition was observed at as low as 50-250 pg/ml, and the effect was maximal at 100 ng/ml (ID50; 2 ng/ml). The lowest concentration of IL-1 used (0.5 pg/ml), in contrast, showed a tendency to stimulate LH-induced cAMP accumulation. Effect of IL-1 on the specific binding of [125I]LH to granulosa cells was then examined, which showed that IL-1 (100 ng/ml) significantly reduced the specific binding by 36%. IL-1 also significantly reduced intra- and extracellular cAMP accumulation by the cells in response to forskolin (50, 150 microM) by 28-46%, indicating that IL-1 can directly inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. Contrary to these inhibitory actions of IL-1 on LH-stimulated cAMP generation, IL-1 did not significantly reduce progesterone secretion induced by (Bu)2cAMP. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of IL-1 on LH-stimulated progesterone secretion is due to its actions at at least two different sites along the LH-stimulated, cAMP-mediated, progesterone biosynthetic pathway, the LH receptor level and adenylate cyclase systems. The post-cAMP steps of progesterone production, in contrast, did not seem to be affected by IL-1.\r"

This study characterized proteins in rat placenta that show immunological cross-reactivity with antisera to hPS beta G. Immunocytochemical studies using two independent preparations of anti-hPS beta G showed intense specific staining within basophilic cytotrophoblast cells of the basal zone of the gestation day 15 rat placenta. In contrast, basophilic cytotrophoblasts located in the labyrinth did not stain. Subsequent experiments used gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis to compare PS beta G in human placenta and serum with immunoreactive proteins in rat placenta and serum. A set of two or three proteins was detected in human villous tissue and pregnancy serum with apparent mol wt (Mr) ranging from 54,000-76,000. In contrast rat placenta showed a major immunoreactive protein with 120,000 Mr, while rat serum contained bands of 48,000 64,000 and 69,000 Mr. Explant cultures of rat basal zone tissue secreted two [35S]methionine-labeled proteins that were immunoreactive, a major 120,000 Mr species and a minor 76,000 Mr form, with pI values of 4.6-5.5; tunicamycin inhibited the secretion of both species. Thus, a 120,000 Mr glycoprotein appears to be the major tissue and secreted form of rat PS beta G analog in day 15 placenta. Finally, the cytochemical localization of PS beta G-like proteins in rat placenta showed a progressive gestational shift from giant trophoblast cells in the parietal yolk sac placenta on day 12 to the basal zone cytotrophoblast cells by day 15. Data indicate that the pregnant rat may provide an animal model for investigation of the biological function of PS beta G during late gestation.\r"

  ".U": "89289578\r", 
  ".W": "Glucocorticoid hormones suppress the release of ACTH by the anterior pituitary gland: rapid feedback inhibits hormone secretion within 30 min of steroid application, delayed feedback is most effective at 1-2 h, and slow feedback becomes manifest in several hours. The aim of the present study was to determine the type of glucocorticoid receptor that mediates the rapid and delayed feedback actions of glucocorticoids and whether genomic activation occurs during the rapid and delayed time domains. Rat anterior pituitary cell columns were perfused with Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, 41-residue CRF (10(-9) M) was used as the secretagogue, which stimulated ACTH secretion to a peak of about 8- to 10-fold of basal release. The amount of ACTH released upon repeated 5 or 10 min stimulation with CRF was constant. Treatment with 10(-7) M corticosterone for 20 min immediately before and for 10 min during stimulation with CRF reduced ACTH release by about 50% (rapid feedback), while at 1 h and 2 h after the initial exposure to corticosterone the secretory response was 33% and 15% of control, respectively. The effect of corticosterone was prevented by the type II glucocorticoid/progesterone antagonist RU 38486 (10(-6) M). The selective type II receptor agonist RU 28362 (10(-7) M) was even more potent than corticosterone in inhibiting ACTH release; the time course of action was similar. When actinomycin D (10(-4) M) was applied in conjunction with RU28362 or corticosterone, no inhibitory effects appeared up to 2 h after the exposure to steroid. Puromycin (10(-4) M), given during and for 1 h after the administration of the steroid prevented the rapid as well as the delayed (1 h) inhibitory action of RU28362. When puromycin was removed from the system, a 75% inhibition of stimulated ACTH release developed at 2 h after the application of the steroid, indicating that translatable messenger RNA (mRNA) was still present in the cells. Cycloheximide (10(-4) M) was only partially effective at inhibiting rapid or delayed feedback, and increasing its concentration impaired the ACTH response to CRF-41. In summary, at the pituitary level the rapid as well as the delayed feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion by adrenal corticoids is exerted via type II glucocorticoid receptors. Furthermore, both rapid and delayed feedback require the synthesis of new mRNA and protein.\r"

Theca cells from large porcine follicles (8-10 mm) were plated (5 x 10(5) cells/ml.well) in serum-free M199, treated with increasing doses of growth factors: IGF-1 (0.1-50 ng/ml), IGF-II (0.5-200 ng/ml), EGF (0.021-100 ng/ml), TGF beta (0.001-40 ng/ml), or insulin (0.01-50 micrograms/ml), with or without human CG [(hCG); 20 ng/ml], and incubated for 72 h. Levels of steroids in media were determined by RIA. Insulin increased (P less than 0.05) basal and gonadotropin-induced secretion of androstenedione, progesterone, estradiol, and testosterone. IGF-I increased (P less than 0.05) the basal and hCG-induced secretion of progesterone and androstenedione at the highest doses, but did not affect basal secretion of estradiol or testosterone. IGF-II, at the highest doses, increased (P less than 0.05) thecal steroidogenesis, but only after administration of hCG. In contrast, TGF beta increased (P less than 0.05) basal and gonadotrophin-induced secretion of estradiol but inhibited thecal secretion of progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. EGF did not alter thecal secretion of progesterone, androstenedione, or testosterone but significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited basal and hCG-stimulated secretion of estradiol. In conclusion, insulin IGF-I, IGF-II, EGF, and TGF beta can modulate steroidogenesis in porcine theca cells.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been reported to increase intestinal calcium absorption in suckling rats. The mechanism of this effect is unknown, as are the roles of vitamin D-dependent and independent pathways. The present studies were undertaken to investigate the ability of EGF to accelerate the postnatal induction of the vitamin D-dependent intestinal calcium-binding protein, calbindin-D9k. Subcutaneous administration of EGF increased duodenal calbindin-D9k in suckling rats by more than 100% (P less than 0.001). The effect of EGF was not seen in older weaned animals or when EGF was given to suckling rats by gavage. Administration of EGF simulated the changes of normal development. 1) It increased calbindin-D9k, and the effect was greater in proximal than distal duodenum. 2) EGF increased alkaline phosphatase activity to the same extent in proximal and distal duodenum. 3) EGF increased sucrase more markedly in distal than in proximal epithelium. Maximal and half-maximal effects of EGF on each of these proteins were observed at twice daily doses of 0.1 and 0.04 microgram/g BW, respectively. 4) EGF at the maximally effective dose produced a small (30%) but statistically significant (P less than 0.005) increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. 5) Most importantly, EGF treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in intestinal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D receptors (VDR) in the proximal segments of the small intestine (P less than 0.001). EGF effects on calbindin-D9k and VDR were specific for the intestine, as EGF did not change kidney calbindin-D9k or kidney VDR. Thus, EGF was able to prematurely initiate a complex series of molecular changes that occur during normal development. The mechanism of EGF's action to stimulate calcium absorption appears to involve a maturation effect on the vitamin D-dependent pathway.\r"

In addition, IL-6 potentiated both GHRF- and TRH-induced hormone release without an affect on intracellular cAMP. These data demonstrate a new biological activity for IL-6 and provide evidence for immune system regulation of anterior pituitary hormone release.\r"

Diabetes-resistant (DR) BB/Wor rats are not lymphopenic and become diabetic rarely and at a significantly younger age. To examine the genetic basis for diabetes, lymphopenia, and age at onset of diabetes among inbred BB/Wor rats, we crossed nonlymphopenic diabetic rats with lymphopenic DP animals and studied F1, F2, and backcross progeny. F1 rats were neither diabetic nor lymphopenic. Diabetes (both types) and lymphopenia reappeared among F2 rats, confirming the permissive association of diabetes and lymphopenia and the recessive nature of both. The absence of diabetes in F1 rats also suggested that the combination of genes responsible for diabetes among lymphopenic and nonlymphopenic rats may be distinct. Nonlymphopenic parental, F1, and F2 rats revealed normal lymphocyte subsets, including CD8+ and RT6+ T-lymphocytes. Lymphopenic parental and F2 rats revealed the absence of CD8+ and RT6+ cells, indicating that these T-lymphocyte abnormalities of lymphopenic DP rats segregate with the lymphopenia gene. The distribution of the ages at onset of diabetes among F2 lymphopenic and F2 intercross rats was significantly earlier than among lymphopenic parental and backcross animals, suggesting that the age of diabetes onset is a heritable trait and that the gene(s) or genetic modifier(s) responsible for the earlier onset of F2 diabetes was acquired from the nonlymphopenic parents. Our genetic studies also confirmed the observations that the 2- and 7-kilobase Bam HI fragments of the MHC class I region do not correlate with diabetes or lymphopenia.\r"

Since it has not been fully established whether nonparenchymal cells participate in the elimination of sinusoidal purines, isolated Kupffer cells and endothelial cells were tested for their capacity to degrade extracellular purines. After perfusion and digestion of rat livers by collagenase, the resulting mixed cell population was separated by centrifugal elutriation. The isolated parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells were incubated for up to 2 hr in the presence of [8(-14)C]adenosine, [8(-14)C]guanosine and [8(-14)C]hypoxanthine (50 mumoles per liter). In the deproteinized medium, adenosine, guanosine, inosine, adenine, guanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid and allantoin were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Radioactive peaks were collected and counted. Nonparenchymal cells catalyzed the degradation of adenosine into inosine and hypoxanthine. However, the formation of xanthine, uric acid or allantoin from adenosine could only be detected in hepatocyte suspensions. Within 15 min, adenosine was completely eliminated from the medium by Kupffer cells, whereas endothelial cells catabolized only less than half of the initial amount of the adenine nucleoside during this time period. Accordingly, incubation of nonparenchymal cells in the presence of hypoxanthine did not result in the formation of further breakdown products of the purine, whereas its catabolites slowly accumulated in the medium of hepatocytes. Guanosine conversion into guanine and xanthine was much slower in endothelial cells as compared to Kupffer cells and hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The growth difference was not due to varying cell survival nor to attachment ability after passage. The degree of DNA synthesis was estimated by [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA. [3H]thymidine uptake increased with escalating concentrations of calf serum and reached a plateau at 5% calf serum in WKY rats, whereas an excessive, continuous rise was observed in SHR with up to a 20% concentration. [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA was tested after stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor. A significantly higher amount of newly synthesized DNA in vascular smooth muscle cells from SHR was noted when the cells were stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor alone, and their simultaneous addition did not significantly change the 50% effective concentration but heightened the maximal response. These data provide evidence of increased aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation from aortas of SHR after mitogen stimulation and suggest a defect in growth stimulatory-inhibitory control.\r"

We hypothesized that the Zucker fatty rat, a widely studied model of obesity and insulin resistance, might also be characterized by hypertension. Mean arterial pressure directly measured in the unanesthetized, unrestrained obese (fatty) Zucker rat was significantly greater than in two strains of nonobese control rats, the lean Zucker rat and the Lewis rat. The greater blood pressure in the obese rats was not dependent on hyperphagia or increased body weight per se since moderate caloric restriction, achieved by pair-feeding with lean rats, decreased weight gain but did not attenuate hypertension. Pair-fed obese rats retained less sodium than lean control rats, suggesting that greater blood pressure in the obese rats is not a consequence of increased renal retention of sodium. A unique feature of the Zucker strain is that the increased blood pressure appears to be specifically associated with the obese genotype. The findings suggest that the obese Zucker rat might provide a useful experimental model of obesity and hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies from several laboratories have shown perturbations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] metabolism in hypertension. While these perturbations may exert their effect on blood pressure via their actions on calcium metabolism, it is possible that this vitamin D metabolite may have direct effects on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) physiology. To examine this, we studied the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on VSMC growth and found that this substance suppressed VSMC [3H]thymidine uptake; furthermore, this vitamin D metabolite also suppressed the stimulatory effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on VSMC proliferation. The concomitant presence of this substance appeared to be required for its action on VSMC growth since cells pretreated with the vitamin D metabolite for up to 72 hours and then washed of the substance grew normally and responded to EGF. Studies were also done to determine if 1,25(OH)2D3 had any effect on the function of EGF receptors on VSMC. Experiments using Iodine-125-labeled EGF showed no differences in the binding of this ligand to VSMC, either untreated or treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, which indicates the effect of the vitamin D metabolite on VSMC growth (when exposed to EGF) was not mediated by an alteration of EGF receptor function. The results of these studies have implications for the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of prolonged infusions of ethanol on endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and on endothelium-independent relaxation induced by papaverine were studied and compared in isolated perfused rat mesenteric artery preparations. Infusion of ethanol over 60 minutes at concentrations of 1.6, 4.7, 6.3, and 7.9 mg/ml caused concentration-related inhibition of norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction. In preparations infused with 6.3 and 7.9 mg/ml, this effect reached a maximum after 10-20 minutes but had vanished by the end of the infusion; 1 hour after the end of the infusion, the effects of norepinephrine were potentiated by 71% and 108%, respectively. Acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation (EC50 3.0 ng/ml in controls) was significantly reduced after 6.3 mg/ml ethanol infusion and totally abolished after 7.9 mg/ml ethanol infusion. ATP-induced vasorelaxation (EC50 180 ng/ml in controls) was also abolished after 7.9 mg/ml of ethanol infusion. By contrast, the vasorelaxant effects of papaverine were not affected by 7.9 mg/ml ethanol infusion. Light-microscopic examination revealed that the endothelial cells were present in ethanol-treated and in control mesenteric arterial beds. These observations indicate that ethanol suppresses endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation without apparent removal of the endothelial cells. The compromised relaxant capacity of the endothelium after ethanol and the resultant intensification of the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine may contribute to the development of vascular diseases such as hypertension and stroke.\r"

Therapy for control of diabetes included diet alone in 1.6%, oral hypoglycaemic agents in 90.6% and insulin in 7.8%. Glycaemic control was satisfactory in 4.8%, fair in 41.2% and poor in 54.0%. Blood sugar values were normal without any therapy in 33 out of the 206 patients (16%) after the onset of renal insufficiency. The mean interval between the onset of diabetes and the appearance of proteinuria was 9.5 +/- 7.05 years. Proteinuria appeared within one year in 23 patients (9.2%), 1-5 years in 32 (12.8%), 6-10 years in 86 (34.4%) and more than 10 years in the remaining 109 patients (43.6%). Proteinuria was of nephrotic range in 17.6% of patients. Renal insufficiency was present in 206 (82.4%) patients and occurred 10.5 +/- 7.5 years after the detection of diabetes. Hypertension was present in 61.2% and was first detected 7.5 +/- 7.4 years after onset of diabetes. Endstage renal disease occurred 11.8 +/- 6.8 years after the onset of diabetes mellitus. Thus, clinical evidence of diabetic nephropathy is present in most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus within a decade after the detection of diabetes. Subsequent progression to end-stage renal failure is rapid in the face of poorly controlled hypertension and hyperglycemia in the economically poor countries.\r"

  ".W": "The anorexia associated with acute and chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions is poorly understood. Our objectives were to explore the anorexigenic effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the rat. Recombinant human (rh) IL-1 beta, murine (rm) IL-1 alpha and to a lesser extent rhIL-1 alpha significantly reduced food intake at greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/kg i.p. but not at lower doses, in young (200-250 g) meal-fed rats on chow diets. The anorexic effect appears to be mediated by prostaglandins since pretreatment with ibuprofen completely blocked it, and a fish oil based diet abolished it, in comparison to corn oil or chow diets. Fish oil feeding also decreased basal and IL-1 stimulated prostaglandin E2 production by tissues in vitro (liver, brain, peritoneal macrophages) and in the whole body. Constant intravenous infusions of lower doses of IL-1 also diminished food intake, though intravenous boluses did not (reflecting rapid renal clearance). Chronic daily administration of IL-1 caused persistent inhibition of food intake for 7-17 d in chow and corn oil fed rats, but had no effect in fish oil fed rats. There was an attenuation of the effect (tachyphylaxis) after 7 d in corn oil and chow fed rats, but slowed weight gain and lower final weights were observed after 17-32 d of daily IL-1. Old (18-20 mo Fisher 344) rats showed less sensitivity to IL-1 induced anorexia. In conclusion, IL-1 is anorexigenic in the rat, but this is influenced by the structural form of IL-1, the route and chronicity of administration, the source of dietary fat, and the age of the animal. The ability of prior fat intake to influence the anorexic response to IL-1 represents a novel nutrient-nutrient interaction with potential therapeutic implications.\r"

In tonsillar B cells, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan l (SAC) alone induced low levels of LT mRNA accumulation. However, SAC and anti-mu were strongly synergistic with PMA in this induction. Peak LT mRNA expression in tonsillar B cells stimulated by PMA plus SAC occurred between 48 and 72 h and was approximately half as much as that in PMA plus anti-CD3-stimulated T cells. Cyclosporine A was not effective in inhibiting LT mRNA accumulation by stimulated tonsillar B cells. A number of B cell lines could also be stimulated by PMA to express LT mRNA. Peak accumulation of LT mRNA in the cell line RPMI 1788 stimulated with PMA peaked about 8 h. A23187 in combination with PMA caused this accumulation to increase slightly and to peak earlier. The cytotoxic effects in the supernatants of stimulated B cells were contributed mostly by LT. The results indicate that tonsillar B cells are important in LT production and that there are important differences in the stimulation requirements for LT production and in LT mRNA expression kinetics between tonsillar B cells and B cell lines.\r"

We identified two patient sera that selectively immunoprecipitated from such extracts the Ro particle containing the hY5 RNA (RohY5 particle). Using cell fractions either enriched in or depleted of RohY5 particles, we have shown that these sera contain autoantibodies that target an antigenic determinant on the 60-kD Ro polypeptide that is expressed only on RohY5 particles and is absent on the Ro particles containing the hY1-hY4 RNAs (RohY1-hY4 particles). In a competitive inhibition assay using a cell fraction enriched in RohY1-hY4 particles but depleted of RohY5 particles, four of six control anti-Ro sera were also shown to contain antibodies reactive with the epitope specific for the RohY5 particle. Thus anti-RohY5 antibodies frequently occur in tandem with anti-Ro antibodies, but are not detected unless inhibition assays are performed. Finally, anti-RohY5 specific sera do not immunoprecipitate any Ro particles from various nonhuman cell lines. In contrast to other autoantibodies in systemic lupus and related diseases that bind conserved regions on conserved polypeptides, this observation suggests that a portion of the anti-Ro response targets a nonconserved epitope on a conserved autoantigen.\r"

  ".U": "89292187\r", 
  ".W": "Malignant prostatic carcinoma, a major cause of cancer mortality in males, most often metastasizes to secondary sites in bone. Frequently, the growth rate of the secondary tumor in bone marrow is considerably greater than that of the slowly growing primary prostatic tumor. We now report that two lines of human prostatic carcinoma cells proliferate in response to conditioned media from unstimulated human, rat, or bovine bone marrow. Nonprostatic tumor cell lines showed little or no growth response to the same medium. The proliferative activity found in bone marrow was not duplicated by any of a variety of purified growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), acidic or basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha or beta, interleukins 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6, granulocyte (G), macrophage (M) or granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factor (CSF). Whereas a mixture of G-CSF, M-CSF, and IL 3 produced a mitogenic response in the prostatic carcinoma cells, these three factors were not present in our bone marrow samples in sufficient quantities to promote the observed proliferative response. To further identify the cellular source of the proliferative activity present in bone marrow-conditioned medium, we tested conditioned media made from human bone marrow stromal cells. The stromal cell conditioned medium stimulated increased growth of the prostatic carcinoma cells to levels equivalent to those observed with the bone marrow conditioned medium. These results suggest that novel mitogenic factors that are produced by bone marrow stromal cells and remain in the bone marrow cavity may account, in part, for the preferential growth of prostatic metastases in bone.\r"

Interestingly, EBV DNA was detected in the sample from the patient with CAEBV infection, and in the samples from four other patients with CD3-LDGL. Moreover, a single band for the joined termini of the EBV genome was demonstrated in two samples, suggesting a clonal disorder of those LDGL. These findings strongly suggest that EBV may play a pathogenic role in some cases of LDGL.\r"

Results of preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative electrophysiologic evaluation and long-term clinical follow-up are reported. Left ventricular aneurysm was located in the inferior wall in 8 patients and in the anterior wall in 22. Left ventricular mapping was performed in 15 patients preoperatively and in all 30 patients intraoperatively. Subendocardial resection was supplemented with cryoablation in 26 patients and with laser photocoagulation in 4. Coronary bypass surgery was performed in 27 patients. The surgical mortality rate was 10%; the three deaths were due to cardiogenic shock, pneumonia and sepsis, respectively. At postoperative electrophysiologic study, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 8 (30%) of 27 patients. Previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs were effective in preventing the induction of ventricular tachycardia in four of these eight patients. Two of the remaining four patients received an automatic implantable cardioverterdefibrillator; the other two were treated with amiodarone. At a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 17 months (range 1 to 52), there has been one sudden death and one nonfatal recurrence of ventricular tachycardia in the 18 patients without inducible arrhythmias postoperatively. Among the eight patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia after subendocardial resection, there has been one nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence. Thus, among the 27 patients surviving surgery, 17 (63%) were cured with surgery alone, and another 7 (26%) had their ventricular tachycardia controlled with drugs (n = 5) or the defibrillator (n = 2). Inability to completely map the tachycardia, a clinical history of cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation and the presence of myocardial infarction within 2 months predicted postoperative arrhythmia inducibility and recurrence.\r"

The amounts of visual information and of somatosensory input at the ankle were manipulated. Muscle response latencies, losses of balance, and muscle sequencing were analyzed. Muscle response latencies did not differ across age groups. Loss of balance data indicated that older adults were less stable under conditions in which peripheral vision was occluded and ankle somatosensation was limited (only foveal vision and vestibular input remaining). Older adults showed more antagonist muscle activation and used muscle sequences not seen in young adults (e.g., hip strategy). These effects were exaggerated among subjects in whom borderline pathology had been diagnosed.\r"

Five of the seven responded, but the results were unpredictable, not cost-effective, and had 100% morbidity. We then changed the protocol to selectively remove T-cells by differential ultracentrifugation. The initial goal was to remove 40 times 10(9) T-cells, but it was changed to 80 times 10(9) in order to increase the length of remission. We found that all patients with steroid-dependent chronically active Crohn's disease show evidence of protein calorie malnutrition. We used total parenteral nutrition with T-lymphocyte apheresis in the last 21 of 25 patients so treated. We have now completed a series of 54 patients, achieving a statistically valid remission, lasting an average of more than 18 months, in 48 of them. Criteria of remission included absolute zero steroid dosage. There has been no mortality or evidence of immunocompromise. The only morbidity (four patients) was the need for intravenous catheters during the apheresis procedure. This work has been confirmed elsewhere. Immune studies in active, untreated disease show low serum values of interleukin-2, as well as abnormalities of T-cell responsiveness to interleukin-2. The mechanism of how T-lymphocyte apheresis works is not clear, but it represents a promising new approach to the treatment of Crohn's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Although hypokalemia has been reported after cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation, experimental data indicate that potassium is released from cells during ischemia. The purpose of this investigation was to study serum potassium concentration ([K+]) during closed chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CC-CPR) in humans. Twenty-two patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in cardiopulmonary arrest had simultaneous measurement of central venous and arterial [K+] and blood gases during CC-CPR utilizing current advanced cardiac life support protocols and a pneumatic chest compressor and ventilator. Mean arterial and central venous [K+] were 5.0 +/- 1.3 and 5.6 +/- 2.9 mEq/L, respectively, (p greater than .05) with 7 patients having [K+] of greater than 6 mEq/L. Significant hyperkalemia does occur in some patients during cardiac arrest and CC-CPR. Because poor tissue perfusion during CC-CPR impairs exchange between the interstitial and intravascular compartments, increases in interstitial [K+] would be expected to be even greater. Interstitial hyperkalemia may play a role in the genesis of wide complex electromechanical dissociation (EMD) seen after prolonged cardiac arrest. Since calcium has long been known to be beneficial in the treatment of hyperkalemia-induced dysrhythmias, the success of calcium chloride in treating wide complex EMD may be on the basis of this phenomenon.\r"

Anti-CD4 mAb was administered in vivo and in vitro and its effects on CD4 and CD3 cell surface expression were determined. In vivo, anti-CD4 mAb reduced cell surface expression of its ligand, CD4, and secondarily also reduced cell surface expression of CD3/TCR on CD4+ splenic T cells. In vitro, multivalent cross-linking of CD4 by anti-CD4 mAb and either FcR+ cells or anti-Ig mAb also resulted in decreased surface expression of CD4 and specific comodulation of CD3/TCR. The secondary reduction in cell surface CD3/TCR expression induced by CD4 cross-linking could be pharmacologically disrupted by high doses of PMA, indicating that the comodulation of CD3 with CD4 was dependent upon intracellular mediators, possibly including protein kinase C. These results demonstrate that, in the presence of anti-CD4 mAb, CD4 is functionally associated with the CD3/TCR complex, and that this association is dependent upon the activity of intracellular mediators. Such intracellular mediators might induce the coordinate down-modulation of physically unassociated CD4 and CD3/TCR molecules, or, alternatively, might promote a physical interaction between CD4 and CD3/TCR molecules.\r"

Such membranes were sufficient to directly activate class II-restricted T cell hybridomas without further Ag processing. T cell-stimulating activity remained after treatment of membranes in harsh conditions, including pH 4.0, pH 9.0, high salt, and chaotropic solvents. Activity was lost after exposure to pH 2.0 or protease. The capacity of pH 2.0 (but not protease) treated membranes to present artificially processed, peptide Ag to T cells suggests that exposure to pH 2.0 results in the selective dissociation of processed Ag from membranes. Similar results were obtained in parallel experiments with peptide-pulsed membranes. No qualitative differences were found between physiologically processed Ag and peptide Ag with respect to their remarkably stable association with the APC plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "A unique type of Ag-specific hypersensitivity was induced by challenging the Ag-sensitized mice at the ear. It was elicited within 1 h after the Ag challenge, and thus was distinct from either the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) which developed in 24 h or the immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity which evolved in 4 to 6 h. This hypersensitivity was referred to as early-type hypersensitivity (ETH). The time required for these types of hypersensitivity to develop after immunization was also different; DTH required 4 to 6 days, ETH 9 to 11 days, whereas plasma protein-induced immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity needed 18 to 21 days. The ETH could be induced by a smaller amount of Ag than DTH, and unlike DTH could be transferred by either immune sera or T cell-derived culture factor which was small m.w. Although the ETH developed later than DTH after sensitization, it lasted longer once developed and the pattern of response was inversely related to DTH. Furthermore, the denatured hepatitis B surface Ag induced DTH but not ETH, in contrast to native hepatitis B surface Ag that induced both, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by TETH cells were distinct from those recognized by TDTH cells. The ETH could be induced by most Ag tested including poly(Glu60Ala10Tyr10, L-lactic dehydrogenase, insulin, chicken egg white lysozyme, polymerized human serum albumin, horse gamma-globulin, transferrin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen, but not by purified protein derivative. Because poly(Glu60Ala10Tyr10, L-lactic dehydrogenase, egg white lysozyme and insulin were under the Ir gene control and the inducibility of ETH was Ag dependent and was closely correlated with that of DTH, the expression of ETH also must be regulated by Ir gene. The histopathologic changes in ETH consisted of capillary congestion and edema. The vasopermeability was increased and there was the leakage of plasma proteins into the tissue. Based on these data, we concluded that the ETH reported in this study was a novel type of Ag-specific hypersensitivity.\r"

In the present investigation we have demonstrated that peripheral T lymphocytes from A strain mice exhibited abnormally low proliferative responses after stimulation through Ly-6A/E and Ly-6C molecules when compared to responses of T cells from numerous other mouse strains. The abnormal activation of the Ly-6 pathway of A strain T cells was not due to ineffective FcR cross-linking of the anti-Ly-6 mAb, to inappropriate cellular expression of the Ly-6A/E alloantigen in A strain T cells, or to an active suppressive phenomenon. T lymphocytes from A strain mice proliferated normally when the cells were activated by mAb to Thy-1 or the CD3/TCR complex suggesting that A strain mice did not exhibit a generalized T cell activation defect. Cell separation studies of T cells and accessory cells demonstrated that this defect was quantitative, rather than qualitative, and that it was complex, residing at both the T cell and accessory cell levels. These results suggest that activation of T lymphocytes via the Ly-6 molecule may involve a signaling pathway and/or cell-cell interactions distinct from those required for optimal activation via CD3/TCR.\r"

In our study, the cloning efficiencies, Ag-specific CTL activity and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity of CTL clones generated in IL-2 were compared to those generated in IL-4. In a first experiment, T cells were stimulated with the EBV-transformed B cell line JY and cloned 7 days later with feeder cells and either IL-2 or IL-4. In a second experiment, stimulation of the T cells was carried out in the presence of IL-2 plus anti-IL-4 antibodies or IL-4 plus anti-IL-2 antibodies in order to block the effects of IL-4 and IL-2, respectively, produced by the feeder cells. Although the cloning efficiencies in the second experiment were lower than those obtained in the first experiment, the cloning efficiencies obtained with IL-2 or IL-4 were similar in both experiments. The overall proportion of TCR alpha beta+ T cell clones cytotoxic for the stimulator cell JY established in IL-2 or IL-4 were comparable. A striking difference between the clones obtained in IL-2 or IL-4 was that a large proportion of the clones obtained in IL-4 expressed CD4 and CD8 simultaneously, whereas none of the clones isolated in IL-2 were double positive. Also gamma delta+ T cell clones could be established with IL-4 as a growth factor. TCR gamma delta+ T cell clones isolated in either IL-2 or IL-4 were CD4-CD8- or CD4-CD8+, but the proportion of CD4-CD8+ clones isolated in IL-4 was higher. Interestingly, one TCR gamma delta+ clone isolated in IL-2 was CD4+CD8-. Most of the TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ CTL-clones isolated in IL-2 lysed the NK cell sensitive target cell K562. In contrast, only a small proportion of the TCR alpha beta+ or TCR gamma delta+ CTL clones isolated in IL-4, lysed K562. One TCR gamma delta+ T cell clone (CD-124) isolated in IL-4 and subsequently incubated in IL-2 acquired lytic activity against K562.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In fact, CT pretreated B cells are able to respond to anti-Ig in the presence of IL-4, as measured by both an increase in cell size and entry into S suggesting that IL-4 overcomes the effects of CT on normal B cell activation. Despite blocking the anti-Ig-mediated entry into the cell cycle, CT was not able to interfere with the induction of nonresponsiveness by anti-Ig in normal B cells or with the delivery of growth-inhibitory signal to the B cell lymphoma WEHI-231. These results suggest that there are two signaling pathways mediated by cross-linking of surface Ig: one pathway sensitive and the other insensitive to modulation by CT.\r"

By using the radiolabeled ACTH agonist, (125I-Tyr23) phenylalanine2-norleucine4-ACTH1-24, substantial numbers of ACTH binding sites were detected on T and B lymphocytes, but not on thymocytes. Scatchard analysis revealed two types of binding sites on each cell population, one with Kd1 = 0.088 +/- 0.025 nM and one with Kd2 = 4.2 +/- 0.6 nM; however, the absolute number of binding sites per cell was different. B lymphocytes expressed approximately three times the number of Kd1 binding sites per cell when compared with T lymphocytes. However, ACTH receptor expression by these cell populations was not static as suggested by the ability to induce receptor expression via mitogens. B or T cells and thymocytes stimulated with the mitogens LPS or Con A, respectively, substantially increased their number of Kd1 binding sites per cell (approximately three-fold). Even more dramatic increases in Kd1 receptor expression (approximately 100-fold) were observed when comparing \"normal\" and stimulated thymocytes. To demonstrate that these ACTH binding sites were in fact functional, cAMP levels were measured in lymphocytes 10 min after exposure to varying concentrations of ACTH. Dose-dependent increases in cAMP levels were observed, with significant stimulation occurring with as little as 0.1 nM ACTH added. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the presence of functional ACTH receptors on normal, rat T and B lymphocytes.\r"

Using these systems, we have shown that monokines contained in supernatants from LPS-stimulated human monocyte/macrophages (MO) up-regulate HIV expression, reflected by an increase in reverse transcriptase activity, viral RNA levels, and expressed viral proteins. Current studies were designed to determine whether viral Ag can interact with MO and secondarily affect HIV1 expression by stimulating monokine production. We found that certain herpes-group viruses, including CMV and EBV, augment HIV1 expression by inducing monokine production, whereas others, such as HSV1, HSV2, varicella-zoster virus, and human herpes virus 6 were unable to function in this capacity. The HSV1 and HSV2 Ag which failed to stimulate monokine production did not interfere with MO stimulation by CMV Ag, suggesting that failure to induce HIV expression was not attributable to MO suppression. When nonherpes group viruses were tested, we found that human adenovirus, hepatitis B virus, and vaccinia virus all failed to stimulate the production of monokines capable of activating HIV in the chronically infected cell lines. In contrast, HIV1 can augment its own expression by inducing the secretion of monokines which up-regulate HIV expression in the infected cells. The viral Ag-induced MO supernatants capable of up-regulating HIV expression did so in a dose-dependent manner, whereas viral Ag alone produced no significant change. Monokine production mediated by viral Ag was not attributable to contaminating endotoxin. These studies provide a model to determine whether other opportunistic infections may induce the expression of HIV by indirect mechanisms, such as the stimulation of cytokine production.\r"

We could indeed show by RNA dot blot analysis that IL-1 stimulated de novo expression of the p55 chain of the IL-2R thus initiating high affinity IL-2 binding and a proliferative response. Because macrophages and epithelial cells in the thymus produce IL-1 we propose that IL-1 is involved in early events during maturation of immature thymocytes.\r"

HLA-A2.1-restricted M1 55-73 peptide-specific CTL lines obtained from almost all HLA-A2.1+ individuals fail to recognize the M1 peptide presented by site-directed mutants of HLA-A2 that have either a Val----Ala or Val----Gln substitution at position 152 or a Leu----Trp substitution at position 156. Only one HLA-A2+ individual (donor Q66, HLA-A2,-B53,-B63) has been found who is able to generate a unique repertoire of HLA-A2-restricted M1 peptide-specific CTL that can recognize peptide presented by HLA-A2 mutants with either an Ala or Gln substitution at position 152 or a Trp substitution at position 156. These Q66 M1 peptide-specific CTL could be selected by stimulation with M1 peptide-pulsed transfectants that express the mutant HLA-A2 gene with the Trp substitution at 156. To determine if the presence of the unique CTL repertoire could be attributed to a variant HLA-A2 molecule in Q66, sequences were determined from polymerase chain reaction-amplified segments of the HLA-A2 RNA. Two different HLA-A2 genes were found expressed in Q66 cells: one is identical to HLA-A2.1 and the other is identical to HLA-A2.2F (Gln----Arg at position 43, Val----Leu at position 95, and Leu----Trp at position 156). These results demonstrate that a different CTL repertoire specific for HLA-A2 plus the M1 55-73 peptide is generated in an individual that expresses both HLA-A2.1 and HLA-A2.2F compared to individuals who express HLA-A2.1 alone, and that the unique repertoire can be selected by the presence of an HLA-A2 molecule with a single amino acid substitution at position 156.\r"

The elaboration of this monocyte suppressor factor (MSF) was not inhibited by indomethacin. It has an apparent Mr of 50 to 60 kDa. It does not inhibit soluble IL-1 in the murine thymocyte costimulator assay but does inhibit the activity of membrane bound IL-1, which we observed to be almost exclusively IL-1 alpha. MSF contains elevated amounts of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) when measured either as bioactivity or in an ELISA. Its immunosuppressive properties are inhibited by anti-PAI antibody. Furthermore, the eluate but not the effluent of an anti-PAI immunoabsorbent column contains all of the immunosuppressive activity. Based on these data we suggest that MSF is, in fact, PAI and postulate that the mechanism of action is inhibition of the plasmin cascade, thereby preventing the release of membrane bound IL-1. This suggests that monocytes possess an autoregulatory circuit that may have implications for the kinetics of the inflammatory response.\r"

The alloreactive cytotoxic response was strongly inhibited by mAb specific for MHC class I determinants (W6/32, 65% inhibition and BBM.1, 58% inhibition). Acute IM lymphocytes lysed the allogeneic EBV-negative cell lines HSB2 (45%) and HTLV-1 T cell lines (16%). NK cell-depleted lymphocytes from an acute IM patient demonstrated preferential lysis of K562 transfected with human HLA-A2 (73%) compared with the K562 transfected control (20%). Cold target competition studies with allogeneic and autologous target and competitor LCL demonstrated no significant competitive inhibition between allogeneic and autologous cells. We interpret these results as evidence that 1) the acute IM-alloreactive cytotoxic response is mediated primarily by CTL; 2) these alloreactive CTL lyse allogeneic target cells irrespective of EBV antigenic expression; 3) MHC class I expression is sufficient for allogeneic recognition and lysis of target cells; 4) distinct effector CTL populations mediate lysis of autologous and allogeneic target cells; and 5) during acute IM, EBV infection results in the induction of both virus-specific and alloreactive CTL populations.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the genetic basis for natural anti-DNA immune responses, we isolated and sequenced the variable gene elements (VH and VL) encoding an anti-DNA antibody expressed by a human hybridoma of normal origin (Kim4.6) and compared these sequences with those reported for four other human anti-DNA antibodies. The Kim4.6 antibody leader and VH segments were identical in nucleotide sequence with the VH1.9III germ-line VH3 gene, and the Kim4.6VL segment showed 98% nucleotide sequence identity with a V lambda I subgroup gene expressed in a Burkitt's lymphoma. Comparative analysis of Kim4.6 and other human hybridoma anti-DNA antibodies indicated that anti-DNA immune responses are diverse in terms of VH and VL gene utilization but may exhibit a bias toward rearrangement of VH genes that are over-represented in the fetal pre-B cell repertoire. Moreover, Kim4.6 and three of four other sequenced human anti-DNA antibodies appear to use a germ-line diversity gene, DXP'1, which may represent a counterpart of the DFL16.1 segment utilized in murine responses to the hapten nitrophenyl. Taken together, our findings indicate that anti-DNA immune responses can be encoded by nonmutated VH genes and that the elements and molecular mechanisms which engender this response are essentially the same among natural and lupus-associated anti-DNA antibodies. Our data also suggest that natural autoimmune responses originate early in B cell ontogeny as is consistent with the hypothesis that autoreactivity plays a major role in shaping the normal immune repertoire.\r"

In this report, cDNA clones that encode the CD19 molecule were isolated and the amino acid sequence of CD19 was determined. A cDNA clone that selectively hybridized to RNA from CD19+ cell lines was selected from a human tonsilar cDNA library using differential hybridization. This cDNA was used to isolate additional cDNA clones. Four of the five longest cDNA clones isolated were sequenced and found to contain unique sequences presumed to be introns. One clone, pB4-19, was near full length (2.1 kb) and did not contain these putative introns. pB4-19 contained an 1685 bp open reading frame that could encode a protein of about 60 kDa. COS cells that were transfected with pB4-19 expressed a nascent cell surface structure reactive with the anti-B4 antibody. Immunoprecipitation of this structure from surface-iodinated COS cells with the anti-B4 antibody revealed a m.w. 85,000 protein. Northern blot analysis indicated that pB4-19 hybridized with a predominant mRNA species of 2.4 kb and a minor species of 1.5 kb, found in only CD19+ cells. The pre-B cell line, PB-697, also expressed four larger RNA species that hybridized with pB4-19. cDNA clones that encode the putative cytoplasmic portion (247 amino acids) of the mouse CD19 molecule were also isolated and found to be highly homologous (79 and 75%) with the human CD19 nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The deduced amino acid sequence of the CD19 cytoplasmic tail shared no significant homology with other known proteins but the putative extracellular region contained two Ig-like domains indicating that CD19 is a new member of the Ig superfamily.\r"

  ".W": "Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) have been characterized phenotypically and functionally as cytotoxic T lymphocytes, NK cells or lymphokine-activated killer cells. The most prominent morphologic feature of LGL is large cytoplasmic granules that are thought to contain the molecules responsible for cell lysis. In this study, we describe the morphologic and functional characteristics of IL-2-dependent cytotoxic lymphocytes derived from feline PBL. Stimulation of feline PBL with Con A followed by culturing in 50 U of gibbon monkey IL-2 human rIL-2 induced long term lymphocyte cultures. These lymphocytes are cytotoxic for the feline leukemia virus-induced T cell lymphoma (FL74), in a 4-h 51Cr release assay. All cell lines are either constitutively cytotoxic for FL74 cells, or cytotoxic in a lectin-dependent cell cytotoxic assay, the latter being a characteristic of low passage cultures. In contrast, no cell lines express self lysis or lysis for other lines. [3H]TdR uptake showed that 1 U of human rIL-2 produces a 50% maximal proliferative response by feline lymphocytes suggesting a high degree of homology between the ligand binding sites of feline and human IL-2R. Feline cytotoxic lymphocytes possess abundant cytoplasm containing large azurophilic granules characteristic of LGL. These granules are bound by a bilipid membrane and contain numerous smaller membrane-bound vesicles 50 to 60 nm in diameter. A model is proposed, whereby subsequent to binding of LGL to target cell the large granules fuse to the LGL plasma membrane and release the small vesicles into the binding pocket. The vesicles then transport the lytic molecules directly and selectively to the target cell membrane.\r"

Both T cell clones also responded to peptide Ag in the absence of additional APC suggesting that T cells can simultaneously present and respond to Ag. T cell clones could only present peptide Ag and not an appropriate strain of inactivated whole influenza virus thus indicating an inability to process Ag conventionally. Peptide presentation by T cells was dose dependent, restricted by MHC class II Ag and was dependent on the number of Ag presenting T cells per culture. Experiments with nested peptides showed that the same epitope was recognized in the presence and absence of PBMC APC. No Ag or IL-2 from the propagation procedure was carried over into assays and two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of each clone detected no contaminating cells with the phenotype of monocytes, macrophages or B cells; in each T cell clone, all cells expressing MHC class II Ag co-expressed CD3. These date therefore provide strong evidence that human T cell clones can simultaneously present and respond to appropriate forms of Ag.\r"

  ".U": "89292831\r", 
  ".W": "When platelets are stimulated with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin, or ristocetin, they bind soluble von Willebrand factor (vWF). In contrast, platelets adhere to solid-phase vWF without apparent stimulus. This work characterizes the adhesion of washed human platelets to highly purified solid-phase human vWF. VWF (iodine 125-labeled vWF) was demonstrated to bind in a quantifiable fashion to the internal surfaces of glass capillary tubes, saturating at a surface density of 3.0 mg/ml. The multimeric structure of bound vWF was the same as that of normal vWF. Platelets were washed, labeled with indium 111, and resuspended with washed red blood cells (RBCs) in balanced salt solution containing Ca++, Mg++, and apyrase. The washed platelet RBC suspension was aspirated through capillary tubes to which vWF was adsorbed. Adhesion of platelets to adsorbed vWF was directly dependent on the surface density of vWF. Increasing wall shear rate (100 to 5000 sec-1) produced increasing platelet adhesion to maximum reached at 2500 sec-1. Platelets bound to the solid-phase vWF in an irreversible fashion, and, as demonstrated with scanning electron microscopy, they spread on the surface. When used to stimulate the platelets, ADP, thrombin, and ristocetin all increased the platelet adhesion to solid-phase vWF. ADP- and thrombin-stimulated reactions were inhibited by prior treatment of the platelets with 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine. This inhibitor of ADP binding had no effect on the baseline platelet adhesion reaction (without ADP or thrombin). Adenosine in concentration up to 1 mmol/L failed to inhibit adhesion. The data demonstrate that washed platelets adhere to solid-phase vWF without added agonists, that the reaction is dependent on surface density vWF and wall shear rate, that they bind irreversibly, and that they demonstrate surface spreading. In addition, these platelets can be stimulated to increase their adherence to vWF by using ADP, thrombin, and ristocetin.\r"

This paper attempts to correct this deficiency by examining the clinical workload of a single handed neurologist practising in the south west of England. Diagnostic information is given on the 3020 new patients seen during 1984-1986 and is compared with similar data on 836 new patients seen in 1975. The pattern of diagnoses on these patients varies little from year to year, indicating a constancy of referral habit of those who seek neurological advice. However, the referral rates for different conditions do not correspond with what would be expected from epidemiological data, for when the incidence of particular conditions in the neurology clinic is compared with the calculated incidence in the community, very wide variations are noted. The implications of these data are discussed and it is suggested that further studies should be performed before detailed predictions are made on how many neurologists will be needed in this country in the future.\r"

The study was conducted in three phases: selection of households by random digit dialing (Phase I); telephone interviews (Phase II), and self-administered questionnaires and phlebotomy (Phase III). Although this design facilitated the selection of the final study population, it influenced the participation rates by offering opportunities for nonresponse at each phase. Race was the strongest determinant of response rate despite the use of highly-trained, racially-matched telephone interviewers and repeated attempts at refusal conversion. Also discussed are issues of confidentiality, and logistics of biologic specimen collection and handling. The difficulties encountered in this survey are examined, with suggestions for future population-based investigations involving biochemical epidemiology.\r"

The intraventricular pressure (IVP) was monitored over 24 hours, followed by intraventricular injection of radionuclide alone or in combination with water-soluble contrast material. The IVP was elevated and the reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the sagittal sinus was slow in all cases, but there was no obstruction to CSF flow. The spinal subarachnoid space was well seen in all patients. Jugular venograms with pressure monitoring were obtained in four patients (bilaterally in one). These studies confirmed a narrow jugular foramen in all patients with a significant venous pressure gradient (3 to 10 mm Hg) obtained while the catheter was being pulled back from the sigmoid sinus through the foramen. A second gradient was found in the jugular vein in two patients at the level of the upper thoracic aperture. This gradient was 6 and 14 mm Hg, respectively. Identical venograms and monitoring of the venous pressure in a control group showed no pressure gradients across the jugular foramen and smaller gradients (2 to 5 mm Hg) across the thoracic inlet. It is concluded from these studies that ventriculomegaly in achondroplastic children represents hydrocephalus, which is likely secondary to raised intracranial venous pressure due to hemodynamically significant stenosis of the jugular foramen and, in some cases, the jugular vein in the thoracic aperture.\r"

We previously described their application to cerebral blood flow images (intravenous bolus H215O, Kety autoradiographic model). We now describe their application to images of H215O regional tissue activity without conversion to units of blood flow. The sensitivity and specificity of response detection and the accuracy of response localization were virtually identical for the two types of images. Response magnitude expressed in percent change from rest was slightly, but consistently smaller in tissue-activity images. Response magnitude expressed in z-score was the same for the two-image types. Most research and clinical applications of functional brain mapping can employ images of H215O tissue activity (intravenous bolus, 40-sec nondynamic scan) without conversion to units of blood flow. This eliminates arterial blood sampling, thereby simplifying and minimizing the invasivity of the PET procedure.\r"

Distribution of IMP in the brain was also compared with regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by positron emission tomography (PET) in 15 of these 35 cases. A significant regional difference in temporal changes of radioactivity was observed among normal brain structures. A rapid increase with early washout of the tracer was shown in the cerebellum and the occipital cortex, while the basal ganglia revealed a relatively slow increase and prolonged retention, indicating the regional difference in extraction and/or retention of IMP among the cerebral tissues. In cases with unilateral hypoperfusion, the percentage of the activity in the lesion to that in the contralateral normal cortex on the early SPECT was correlated well with that on CBF measured by PET (r = 0.870, p less than 0.001). However, the contrast on the SPECT image decreased with time after injection; 84.0 +/- 7.4% on the SPECT at 5-20 min scan, 87.6 +/- 7.6% at 35-50 min scan and 96.2 +/- 6.3% at 5 hr scan. In a case with a brain tumor having high blood flow documented by PET, increased accumulation of IMP was observed in the tumor on the early images obtained within 20 min followed by a rapid washout. These findings suggested altered extraction and/or retention of IMP in normal and diseased tissues, and these factors should be considered for the assessment of distribution and redistribution of IMP.\r"

The greatest advantage of 133Xe SPECT was to be able to provide absolute rCBF values without arterial sampling. However, its image quality was very poor. Iodine-123 IMP SPECT provided rCBF images of higher quality and it had good correlation to 133Xe SPECT. Iodine-123 IMP SPECT provided the best images to detect mild ischemic lesions. It could detect obstructive or stenotic changes of large cerebral arteries very well except for a moderate stenosis of internal carotid artery. Technetium-99m HM-PAO SPECT also provided very good rCBF images and it had good correlation to 133Xe SPECT. However, the count-density ratios for the ischemic lesions to the contralateral presumed normal areas of [99mTc] HM-PAO SPECT were significantly higher than those of [123I]IMP SPECT.\r"

We have prospectively studied 62 patients of whom 53 had a histologically proven head and neck SCC. The remaining nine had benign lesions. The results of planar imaging in patients with primary disease yielded an 85% sensitivity and 78% specificity. Planar imaging in patients with cervical lymphadenopathy revealed a 59% sensitivity. Nineteen patients also had single photon emission computed tomography imaging which improved the image quality, spatial resolution and sensitivity of the investigation. Twenty-seven patients were scanned before and after radiotherapy and, of these, 96% showed positive uptake in the salivary glands with no evidence of tumor recurrence. This study has shown 99mTc (v) DMSA imaging provides a cheap and rapid method of investigating head and neck SCC and further studies are necessary to evaluate its role in the management of patients with this disease.\r"

However, because estimates of metabolism with other metabolic tracers are sensitive to substrate use, we measured k in 12 dogs during baseline conditions and again after infusion of either glucose (n = 8) or Intralipid (n = 4), interventions that raised arterial glucose or fatty acids by more than fivefold with concomitant changes in myocardial substrate use. Following glucose administration k increased, but no difference was detected after compensation for changes in hemodynamics and myocardial work induced by the infusion (0.18 +/- 0.03 min-1 (t1/2 = 3.9 min) at baseline compared with 0.22 +/- 0.06 min-1 (t1/2 = 3.2 min, p = N.S.). k was not affected by Intralipid infusion (k = 0.15 +/- 0.06 min-1 at baseline and 0.14 +/- 0.04 min-1 during infusion), and correlated closely with MVO2 measured directly (n = 19 comparisons, r = 0.89). The results indicate that estimates of MVO2 using [11C]acetate and PET are valid despite changes in the pattern of myocardial substrate utilization.\r"

The method was validated by comparing SPECT measured percent of injected [99mTc]MDP in 16 normal skulls with well counter measurements of samples of the same bones obtained at surgery. A very good correlation (r = 0.96) was found. A very good interobserver correlation (r = 0.99) and agreement were also obtained when using quantitative bone scintigraphy (QBS). Control SPECT studies of uptake in the right and left iliac bones and the right and left sacroiliac regions in each patient showed no significant differences between the contralateral sides. Studies done in seven subjects at 2 and 4 hr after the same injection and in nine subjects 4 to 8 mo later in the same subjects showed a very good agreement and no significant differences between the two measurements were found. QBS is suggested as an accurate and reproducible index for assessment of the mass of remodeling bone. Preliminary results showed differences in QBS of normal subjects at different ages. A group of 68 young patients aged 18-26 yr showed a significant higher QBS (p less than 0.001) when compared to an older group of 62 patients aged 50-85 yr. There was, however, a wide range of uptake values for the same bone in the same group, suggesting that the method should best be used for following individual patients over time.\r"

An excellent correlation (r = 0.99, s.e.e. = 152) was found between SPECT measured concentration and actual concentration in kidney phantoms. Kidney uptake at 6 hr after injection in normals was 20.0% +/- 4.6% for the left and 20.8% +/- 4.4% for the right. Patients with unilateral nephropathy had a statistically significant (p less than 0.001) low uptake in the diseased kidney (7.0% +/- 4.7%), but the contralateral kidney uptake did not differ from the normal group (20.0% +/- 7.0%). The method was especially useful in patients with bilateral nephropathy. Significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased uptake was found in both kidneys (5.1% +/- 3.4% for the left and 6.7% +/- 4.2% for the right). The total kidney uptake (right and left) in this group showed to be inversely correlated (r = 0.83) with serum creatinine. The uptake of [99mTc]DMSA in single normal kidney was higher (p less than 0.001) than in a normal kidney (34.7% +/- 11.9%), however, it was lower than the total absolute uptake (RT + LT = 41.5% +/- 8.8%) in the normal group. The results indicate that SPECT is a reliable and reproducible technique to quantitate absolute kidney uptake of [99mTc]DMSA.\r"

Lung thallium uptake was measured from anterior projection images using a ratio of heart-to-lung activities. Seventy subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) (Group 3) determined by angiography (greater than or equal to 70% luminal stenosis) underwent thallium perfusion SPECT. Thirty-nine percent of these subjects had multivessel and 61% had single vessel CAD. Lung thallium uptake was elevated in 47 of 70 (67%) Group 3 subjects. Group 3 subjects with elevated lung thallium uptake did not differ from Group 3 subjects with normal lung thallium uptake with respect to extent or distribution of coronary artery disease, left ventricular function, or severity of myocardial ischemia as determined by exercise and redistribution thallium SPECT. Thus, the measurement of thallium lung uptake from anterior projection images obtained during SPECT frequently identifies patients with CAD, but it may not provide supplementary information regarding the extent of myocardial ischemia or ventricular dysfunction.\r"

In both cases, transverse sections were reconstructed using (a) a backprojection method with a ramp filter, (b) a correction for downscatter, (c) a correction for depth attenuation by the Chang method, or (d) both corrections. Each reconstructed myocardium was then divided into four short-axis sections which were radially divided into nine sectors. Sectors with an activity below 80% of the maximum were considered as abnormal. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated relative to a sector-by-sector theoretical anatomic distribution of the perfusion abnormalities. Results demonstrate that, of all situations, the best balance between sensitivity and specificity was achieved with the 180 degrees data collection and no correction at reconstruction. Using the 360 degrees data sampling technique mainly lowered the sensitivity in the patients with a circumflex or right coronary artery disease. It is concluded that there does not seem to be any definite advantage in performing a 360 degrees rather than a 180 degrees data collection in 99mTc myocardial SPECT.\r"

This imaging approach uses a blood time-activity curve derived from a region of interest (ROI) drawn over dynamic PET images of the left ventricle (LV), and a Patlak graphic analysis. The spillover of radioactivity from the cardiac chambers to the myocardium is automatically removed by this analysis. Estimates of rMGU were obtained from FDG PET cardiac studies of six normal human subjects. Results from this study indicate that the FDG time-activity curve obtained from the LV ROI matched well with the arterial plasma curve. The rMGU obtained by Patlak graphic analysis was in good agreement with direct curve fitting results (r = 0.90). The average standard error of the estimate of the Patlak rMGU was low (3%). These results demonstrate the practical usefulness of a simplified method for the estimation of rMGU in humans by PET. This approach is noninvasive, computationally fast, and highly suited for developing parametric images of myocardial glucose utilization rate.\r"

We systematically performed redistribution studies in both supine and prone decubitus, assuming that the latter should result in shifting with respect to each other's cardiac structures and diaphragm as well as subphrenic organs possibly responsible for attenuation. The comparison of both studies in 25 normal subjects by visual interpretation and circumferential profiles analysis showed a complete suppression of significant attenuation in the inferior wall in prone studies. In addition and consequently, the standard deviation of activity in this area was markedly reduced and became close to its value in anterior and lateral walls. This simple technique now routinely performed in over 400 patients drastically improves specificity in the evaluation of inferior wall abnormalities by suppressing attenuation artifacts and, incidently, the effect of high individual variability in left phrenic and subphrenic anatomic configuration.\r"

According to the results, the SPECT value represented the true radioactivity when the objects' sizes were 2.5 times larger than full width at half maximum (FWHM) for hot regions. For cold regions, there were errors of approximately 20% for the true value, even in the case of such large sizes. In addition, sizes at half maximum images corresponded to true object sizes when hot region sizes were larger than 1.4 x FWHM. The relationship between absolute radioactivity and total SPECT value was linear when the threshold level was zero.

Transmission scans are performed with a point source of 68Ge encapsulated in a lead collimator that masks the source into a fan beam in the scanning plane. The source orbits the patient section at the edge of the slice defining collimator. Only events acquired by detector pairs that are collinear with the source are used to calculate the attenuation coefficients. Events from detector pairs that are nearly collinear are rejected, while those from detector pairs that are far from collinear may be used to acquire a simultaneous emission scan. The coincident event rate per unit source activity is over twice that of rod and ring sources. This technique is compared with calculated outline and ring source attenuation correction techniques in a pie phantom. The linear attenuation coefficient for water was measured as 0.096 cm-1, and 0.094 cm-1 when the water contained 12 kBq/cc 68Ga, compared with 0.085 cm-1 for a ring source. Cerebral glucose utilization rates in a normal volunteer reconstructed with transmission scans performed pre- and postinjection of fluorodeoxyglucose show no significant differences. However, values of cortical glucose utilization average 12% above those measured with the fitted outline method in the highest cuts because of the obliqueness of the skull to the planes examined.\r"

We describe a method that simultaneously corrects for these two effects by means of a four-parameter fit to the dynamically acquired data. Unlike with other methods, where the two corrections are performed sequentially, no additional measurement of the dispersion time constant is required. We have validated and tested the method by means of simulations and application to data from six human studies. The mean dispersion time constant of 4.0 +/- 1.2 sec, estimated by the new method for the six studies, is in fair agreement with estimates of 3 to 5 sec derived from cardiac PET.\r"

This study compares dynamic SPECT studies using the two tracers in seven patients with meningiomas. Regions of interest were placed over the lesion and contralateral homologous presumed normal area. The counting-rate ratio for the lesion to the contralateral homologous area (L/N ratio) was then calculated in the first image. L/N ratios of [99mTc]HM-PAO single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were lower than those of [123I])IMP SPECT, particularly in hypervascular meningiomas. Furthermore, time-activity curves showed that the washout of [99mTc]HM-PAO in the tumors was very slow or incomplete, preventing an accurate assessment of vascularity of meningiomas with [99mTc]HM-PAO, as is generally possible with [123I]IMP.\r"

Both early and delayed scans demonstrated abnormal accumulation in all of 23 malignant pulmonary lesions including 21 lung cancer and in two of seven benign conditions. There were significant differences in delayed ratio (uptake ratio of the lesion to the normal lung on delayed scan) and retention index (degree of retention in the lesion) between lung cancer and benign conditions, respectively (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05). The delayed ratio and retention index revealed that adenocarcinoma showed higher 201Tl accumulation than squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma (p less than 0.05) and 201Tl clearance in squamous cell carcinoma was faster than in the other two (p less than 0.05). Mediastinal involvement was detected in five of seven patients on delayed scans. The smallest lesion depicted was 1.5 cm in diameter. Two false negatives had small metastases less than 1.0 cm in diameter. This method seems to be useful to detect lung cancer, to differentiate malignant from benign lesions, and to evaluate mediastinal involvement from lung cancer.\r"

During therapy and follow-up monitoring of 1.4 to 7.1 years (mean 4.7 years), only two patients bled again from esophageal varices, one before complete obliteration of varices and one who temporarily defaulted on follow-up. The few complications were easily managed, and only three required any specific therapy. No child bled from gastric varices. Frequency of sclerotherapy sessions and quantity of sclerosant could be decreased with time, usually after 3 years of sclerotherapy, suggesting that the natural history of decreased bleeding with time in extrahepatic portal hypertension may be accelerated by sclerotherapy. Esophageal varices in children with extrahepatic portal hypertension may be treated safely with sclerotherapy, which is effective in preventing chronic and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity of human cervical epithelial cells immortalized by transfection with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA, to lysis by natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) lymphocytes was evaluated at progressive stages of transformation. Both early- (10-20 wk) and late- (greater than 30 wk) passage HPV16-immortalized cells were resistant to NK lymphocyte cytotoxicity but sensitive to LAK lymphocyte cytotoxicity at lymphocyte-to-cervical cell ratios ranging from 1:1 to 50:1 in a 4-hour 51Cr release assay. Treatment of early-passage HPV16 DNA-immortalized cells with 2.5 U/mL of the NK lymphocytotoxicity-sensitizing lymphokine, leukoregulin, for 1 hour induced modest sensitivity to NK cells (P less than .05) but markedly up-regulated LAK sensitivity twofold to threefold. At the later passages, leukoregulin up-regulation of sensitivity to NK was lost but remained to LAK lymphocytotoxicity. Similarly, an HPV16-positive human cervical carcinoma cell line, QGU, was also resistant to NK lymphocytotoxicity and sensitive to LAK lymphocytotoxicity; leukoregulin failed to confer sensitivity to the NK-resistant QGU tumor cells and increased their sensitivity to LAK lymphocytotoxicity 1.5-fold to twofold. Although the HPV-immortalized cervical cells containing integrated HPV16 DNA were not tumorigenic, they mimicked the response of established HPV16-positive cervical carcinoma cells. HPV16-immortalized cervical epithelial cells provide a useful model for the study of cytokine modulation of dysplastic and neoplastic cervical epithelial cell sensitivity to natural lymphocytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "In the olfactory bulb, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, is expressed after birth when the axons of olfactory epithelial neurons have made synapses in the bulb. It has been suggested that expression of TH is regulated trans-synaptically because on deafferentation of the bulb there is a marked decrease in the contents of TH, dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, which, however, return to normal levels after regeneration of the primary afferents. To date the molecular signalling involved in this trans-synaptic induction has not yet been characterized; I have therefore studied the expression of dopaminergic properties (presence of TH and dopamine uptake) in dissociated cell cultures from embryonic mouse olfactory bulb. I report that the number of dopaminergic cells increases fivefold when olfactory bulb neurons are co-cultured with olfactory epithelial neurons and that soluble factors, rather than cell interactions, mediate this effect. The dopaminergic-inducing factor is the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) which is present in chemosensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium and when added at nanomolar concentrations to olfactory bulb cultures mimics the effect of olfactory epithelial neurons. Significantly the induction of dopaminergic phenotypes brought about by olfactory epithelial neurons is abolished by an antiserum to CGRP. These observations show that CGRP is involved in the differentiation of dopaminergic olfactory bulb neurons.\r"

  ".U": "89295576\r", 
  ".W": "Infection of mice with Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) induces T-cell lymphomas after an average latency period of 150 days. In these lymphomas the MuLV DNA is frequently integrated into the mouse chromosomal DNA in the vicinity of the pim-1 oncogene. Transgenic mice overexpressing the pim-1 oncogene are predisposed to develop T-cell lymphomas, but only to the extent that approximately 10% of the mice develop a lymphoma within 240 days. When these mice are infected with MuLV, lymphomas develop in all mice in only 50-60 days. In these lymphomas MuLV DNA is integrated near either the c-myc or N-myc gene, suggesting that pim-1 and myc synergize in lymphomagenesis. To determine whether this system has a more general application, we have now tested the susceptibility of pim-1 transgenic mice to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), a chemical carcinogen. With a single low dose of ENU, nearly all pim-1 transgenic mice, but only 15% of non-transgenic mice, develop T-cell lymphomas within 200 days. All ENU-induced lymphomas in both pim-1 transgenic and non-transgenic mice express high levels of c-myc messenger RNA, supporting the notion that pim-1 and c-myc synergize in lymphoma induction. We propose that pim-1 transgenic mice could be used to test the oncogenic potential of other chemical compounds.\r"
