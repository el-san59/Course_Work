This series included 38 men and 15 women. Thirty-three patients (62%) presented with transient ischemic attacks, and the remaining 38% were functional stroke patients. Medical risk factors in this group included hypertension in 70%, previous myocardial infarction in 26%, angina in 17%, peripheral vascular disease in 23%, and diabetes in 13%. Sixty-four per cent of the patients had been previously treated with antihypertensive drugs, 43% with antiplatelet agents, and 4% with anticoagulants. Noninvasive vascular evaluation was performed in 25 of 53 (47%) patients, and all underwent angiography before operation. There were no angiographic complications. All patients were operated on with full-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Indwelling shunts were required in 6 of 53 (11%) cases. Intraoperative heparin was given and not reversed; the mean dose was 5100 units. The mean clamp time was 48 minutes. Patch grafts, fashioned from common facial or saphenous veins, were used in 2 patients. Eight patients had contralateral carotid occlusions, but only 2 (25%) required indwelling shunt placement based on EEG criteria. There were no perioperative deaths in this series. One patient had a postoperative stroke, and 1 patient had a postoperative nonfatal myocardial infarction. Transient surgical complications included 3 wound hematomas, 1 wound abscess, and 2 self-limited cranial nerve palsies (13%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Preirradiation chemotherapy is a potentially important component of combined treatment for brain tumors; however, concerns over its side effects and antitumor activity have impeded its evaluation in clinical trials. To determine the feasibility of administering such therapy to children, we assessed the responses of 38 brain tumor patients (median age, 2 years) to 12 weeks of combination chemotherapy given after surgical resection but before irradiation. Transient myelosuppression was noted in all patients, but was not associated with infections or complications of surgical wounds. The ability of the patients to perform activities of daily life, as rated with the Karnofsky performance scale, was either improved (n = 14) or unchanged (n = 18) at the end of the evaluation period. In the remainder of the group, functional deterioration was clearly related to causes other than drug treatment. Prior chemotherapy did not compromise the delivery of radiation except for a brief interruption of spinal irradiation in 3 patients. Objective responses to chemotherapy, defined as a greater than 50% decrease in tumor masses, occurred in 16 of the 31 patients who had subtotal resections; only 6 patients in the entire group showed disease progression during the 12 weeks of drug administration. We conclude that chemotherapy of the type used in this study is well tolerated and produces beneficial effects in children with brain tumors.\r"

We now report our preliminary experiences utilizing these same techniques in the microsurgical management of brachial plexus birth injury. In contrast to other authors and in distinction from our own experiences with vehicular trauma in children, we did not find lesions requiring reconstruction by grafting or neurotization in any of seven plexus explorations for birth injury. The history of the surgical management of brachial plexus birth injury is reviewed, and the rationale for exploration is developed in the context of the natural history of the condition. Differences between our experiences and the existing literature are analyzed, with particular regard for timing of operation and technique of intraoperative assessment of nerve injury. All children with birth injuries of the brachial plexus require careful, repeated neurological evaluation during the first few months of life. Although the great majority make a rapid and satisfactory spontaneous recovery, the minority who do not recover are destined to suffer significant, life-long disability. Microsurgical brachial plexus exploration may benefit this select group of patients.\r"

Children are symptomatic at birth with lower limb deformities and neurological deficits that may be segmental. Myelography and computed tomography disclose hypoplastic or absent vertebrae and atrophic or absent neural elements adjacent to the bony deformity; the spinal column distal to the abnormality may be partially bifid, but is otherwise normal. Spinal ultrasonography was a helpful diagnostic adjunct in one patient. Surgery may be helpful in decompressing partially functioning spinal cord or nerve roots, but may exaggerate the tendency toward spinal instability. The embryology of this abnormality is not clear, but two children had other anomalies suggesting a spinal dysraphic syndrome, and its cause is probably related to a segmental maldevelopment of the neural tube.\r"

Intraoperatively, a rCBF detector was in place over the right frontotemporal area, about 5 to 6 cm from the border of the AVM. Anesthesia was 0.75% isoflurane in oxygen and nitrous oxide. After dural exposure, the rCBF was 27 ml/100 g/min at a pCO2 of 29 mm Hg and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 90 mm Hg. The pCO2 was then elevated to 40 mm Hg, and the rCBF was increased to 55 ml/100 g/min at a MAP of 83 mm Hg. After AVM removal, the rCBF rose to 50 ml/100 g/min at a pCO2 of 27 mm Hg and a MAP of 75 mm Hg. The pCO2 was elevated to 33 mm Hg and the rCBF increased to 86 ml/100 g/min at a MAP of 97 mm Hg. During skin closure, the rCBF was 94 ml/100 g/min at a pCO2 of 26 mm Hg and a MAP of 97 mm Hg. The patient was neurologically normal postoperatively except for a mild, new visual field defect. After 2 to 3 days, the patient gradually developed lethargy, confusion, and nausea with relatively normal blood pressure. An angiogram revealed residual enlargement of the posterior cerebral artery feeding vessel. Computed tomography showed edema extending from the area of AVM resection as far as the frontal region, producing a significant midline shift anteriorly. Intraoperative rCBF monitoring revealed significant hyperperfusion after AVM resection, which was associated with signs and symptoms of the normal perfusion pressure breakthrough syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the majority of persons infected with the parasite, colonization of the intestine is asymptomatic. In others, symptoms of gastrointestinal distress can appear within a week. In rare cases, extra-intestinal amebiasis can cause abscesses in the liver or elsewhere. Many questions about the disease course in different patients remain to be answered. Diagnosis can be made through symptom identification; findings of right-upper-quadrant tenderness, leukocytosis, and an elevated level of alkaline phosphatase; and testing the feces for trophozoites or cysts. Clinicians disagree on whether asymptomatic persons need to be treated, but anyone who is capable of transmitting the disease should be advised of how to avoid exposing others to it.\r"

Other conditions of the joint include fractures, synovitis, and avascular necrosis. There are three major conditions that mimic hip disease: nerve root pressure syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, and vascular insufficiency. Laboratory studies are often of little value for diagnosis. Careful examination and an awareness of possible mimicking and concomitant conditions can be more helpful. Treatment of hip disease should be conservative as long as the patient can tolerate the discomfort and inconvenience. Early treatment may include the use of a cane. If surgery is contemplated, insist that the patient get at least two opinions regarding the need for and type of surgery to be recommended.\r"

The stability constants for the association of these antibodies with DNP-SL and related haptens were measured by fluorescence quenching and ranged from 5.0 X 10(4) M-1 to greater than 1.0 X 10(8) M-1. cDNA clones coding for the heavy and light chains of each antibody and of an additional anti-DNP-SL monoclonal antibody, AN02, have been isolated. The nucleic acid sequence of the 5' end of each clone has been determined, and the amino acid sequence of the variable regions of each antibody has been deduced from the cDNA sequence. The sequences are relatively heterogeneous, but both the heavy and the light chains of AN01 and AN03 are derived from the same variable-region gene families as those of the AN02 antibody. AN07 has a heavy chain that is related to that of AN02, and AN09 has a related light chain. AN05 and AN06 are unrelated to AN02 but share virtually identical heavy and light chains. Preliminary NMR difference spectra comparing related antibodies show that sequence-specific assignment of resonances is possible. Such spectra also provide a measure of structural relatedness.\r"

We describe here formation of monoubiquitin from in vitro translation of mRNAs containing either two complete sequences or one complete ubiquitin and 60% of a second ubiquitin. No diubiquitin precursor was found with the complete diubiquitin mRNA, but the truncated mRNA formed proteins with apparent molecular masses of 30, 24, 7, and 4 kDa. The latter two are the expected products from truncated ubiquitin mRNA. The 30-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-ubiquitin antibodies and was converted to ubiquitin and the 4-kDa form by a ubiquitin isopeptidase-like activity in wheat germ. Other data indicated that the 30-kDa protein had multiple ubiquitins, all linked by isopeptide bonds to the truncated ubiquitin. One of these was the radiolabeled translation product, which should have been linked to the truncated protein by a normal peptide bond. A model is proposed in which ubiquitin itself participates in a transpeptidase activity.\r"

The open reading frame of the RI beta cDNA is 72% identical in nucleotide sequence with the previously cloned RI gene, now referred to as RI alpha. Both genes code for a protein of 380 amino acids and their proteins are 82% identical in amino acid sequence. Sequence similarity is highest in the regions that form the pseudosubstrate-binding site of the catalytic subunit and the two cAMP binding domains. The amino-terminal portion shows the greatest dissimilarity, suggesting that the isoforms may differ in their dimerization properties or interaction with other proteins. In contrast to RI alpha, which is constitutively expressed in all tissues, RI beta is expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner. Brain and spinal cord contained significant levels of RI beta mRNA, testis RNA gave a detectable signal, and all other tissues tested were negative. Expression of a RI beta cDNA in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in the appearance of a RI subunit protein that migrated more slowly than RI alpha after NaDodSO4/PAGE. The native form of RI beta in brain could also be distinguished from RI alpha by its abnormal migration on NaDodSO4/PAGE. RI beta protein produced in 3T3 cells was shown to be functional by its ability to form a cAMP-dependent holoenzyme with the catalytic subunit.\r"

Partial amino acid sequence information from PP4-derived cyanogen bromide fragments was used to design three oligonucleotide probes for screening the library. From 10(6)independent recombinants, 18 clones were identified that hybridized to all three probes. These 18 recombinants contained cDNA inserts encoding a protein of 320 amino acid residues. In addition to the PP4 cDNA we identified 9 other recombinants encoding a protein with considerable similarity (74%) TO PP4, which was termed PP4-X. PP4 and PP4-X belong to the lipocortin family, as judged by their homology to lipocortin I and calpactin I.\r"

By using altered Harvey sarcoma proviruses as models for transduction intermediates, we have investigated the mechanism of regeneration of transforming virus from truncated proviruses with only a single 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) but with a complete 5'-LTR-ras transforming gene. The Harvey proviruses were specifically altered to discriminate between virus regeneration by RNA template switching during reverse transcription, as has been postulated, and virus regeneration by DNA recombination with either helper virus or among elements of the defective provirus alone. For this purpose U3 elements of the Harvey proviral LTR, which are essential for replication but not for transcription, were deleted in vitro. Only proviral constructions with an intact or a nearly intact single LTR regenerated infectious Harvey sarcoma virus. Since all constructions transformed cells and produced identical RNAs, our results exclude a model of virus regeneration by switching of RNA templates during reverse transcription. We conclude that regeneration of infectious Harvey viruses from truncated provirus involved illegitimate recombination of cellular or cotransfected DNAs flanking the 5'-LTR-ras gene of Harvey sarcoma virus. Based on this and evidence from the literature, we propose that retroviral transduction proceeds by way of rare illegitimate recombinations between proviral and cellular DNAs.\r"

Nucleotides and nucleoside di- and triphosphates also react. Depending on the nucleoside used and on the relative amounts of aldehyde, alcohol, and water, preparative reactions reach equilibrium with yields up to 75% in a few hours. The structures have been confirmed by fast atom bombardment MS and proton NMR. Half-lives at 37 degrees C have been determined, and maximum stability is in the pH range of 7.5-9.5. In the absence of alcohol, acetaldehyde-nucleoside adducts could be isolated at 4 degrees C, but these were too unstable to characterize except for their UV spectra, also at 4 degrees C. Ethanol is often present in human blood and tissues, and acetaldehyde is its initial metabolic product, as well as being formed by many other metabolic processes. Both chemicals have separately been implicated in carcinogenic and other cytopathologic processes, but no cooperative mechanism has been proposed. The reactions reported here are of biological concern because they also occur in dilute aqueous solution. These findings supply a mechanism by which ethanol can be covalently bound to nucleic acids under physiological conditions.\r"

To determine whether individual family members are overproduced in response to different drugs, the P-glycoprotein precursors in several independently isolated cell lines, which were selected for resistance to vinblastine or taxol, were compared. Individual cell lines selected with vinblastine overproduced P-glycoprotein precursors of either 120 or 125 kDa. Taxol-selected cell lines overproduced either the 125-kDa precursor or both precursors simultaneously. Two similar but distinct peptide maps for the mature P-glycoproteins were observed. These maps corresponded to each precursor regardless of the drug used for selection. One vinblastine-resistant cell line switched from the 125- to the 120-kDa precursor when grown in increasing concentrations of drug. This change coincided with the overexpression of a distinct subset of mRNA species that code for P-glycoprotein. It is concluded that precursor expression is not drug-specific. These data suggest that individual overproduced P-glycoprotein family members are translated as distinct polypeptides. The results may help to explain the diversity in the multidrug-resistant phenotype.\r"

Genetic heterogeneity of GA has been suggested by the demonstration that administration of pyridoxine to increase the level of pyridoxal phosphate, a cofactor of OATase, reduces hyperornithinemia in a subset of patients. We have cloned and sequenced cDNAs for OATase from two GA patients, one responsive and one nonresponsive to pyridoxine treatment. The respective cDNAs contained different single missense mutations, which were sufficient to eliminate OATase activity when each cDNA was tested in a eukaryotic expression system. However, like the enzyme in fibroblasts from the pyridoxine-responsive patient, OATase encoded by the corresponding cDNA from this individual showed a significant increase in activity when assayed in the presence of an increased pyridoxal phosphate concentration. These data firmly establish that both pyridoxine responsive and nonresponsive forms of GA result from mutations in the OATase structural gene. Moreover, they provide a molecular characterization of the primary lesion in a pyridoxine-responsive genetic disorder.\r"

Use of this technique facilitates fine structural analysis of unpaired DNA bases in DNA with non-B-DNA structure. This method was used to study the non-B-DNA structure adopted by the poly-(dG).poly(dC) sequence under torsional stress at various ionic conditions. In the presence of 2 mM Mg2+, the 5' half of the deoxycytosine tract is very reactive to chloroacetaldehyde, while the 3' half is virtually unreactive. In the poly(dG) tract, chloroacetaldehyde reaction is restricted to the center guanine residues. In the absence of Mg2+, however, it is the 5' half of the deoxyguanine tract that is reactive to chloroacetaldehyde, while the 3' half is unreactive. And chloroacetaldehyde reaction is restricted to the center cytosine residues in the poly(dC) stretch. These results strongly suggest that the poly(dG).poly(dC) sequence is folded into halves from the center of the sequence to form a tetra-stranded-like structure. Such a structure contains either a triplex consisting of poly(dG).poly(dG).poly(dC) strands in the presence of Mg2+ or a triplex consisting of poly(dC).poly(dG).poly(dC) strands in the absence of Mg2+. The fourth strand, not involved in triplex formation, is closely associated with the triplex and is positioned in such a way that DNA bases are exposed and freely accessible to the chloroacetaldehyde reaction.\r"

  ".W": "The surface membrane of the multicellular parasite Schistosoma mansoni is radically reorganized during the transformation of cercariae into schistosomula. The current study investigates factors involved in maturation of the surface from a trilaminate to a multilaminate membrane. When maturation was induced in the presence of puromycin (900 microM), the acquisition of a multilaminate surface and stainability with fluorescein-conjugated Con A were similar to that of control parasites. Similarly, although organisms treated with monensin (0.1 microM) for 3 hr showed large vacuoles in the perinuclear cytoplasm of the subtegumental cells, the surface membrane became multilaminate. In contrast, microtubule-active drugs interfered with maturation: the surface remained largely trilaminate and the percentage of organisms binding Con A to their surface was significantly reduced. Furthermore, large accumulations of multilaminate bodies were found in the subtegumental cells of colchicine-treated parasites, whereas few were seen in the controls. Colchicine-treated schistosomula failed to mature to adult worms upon injection into mice and, like cercariae, they were water tolerant. We therefore conclude that the components that constitute the schistosomula surface preexist in cercariae and suggest that they are stored in multilaminate bodies before being transported to the surface with the help of microtubules. The acquisition of the multilaminate membrane may be essential for survival of the parasites in vivo and in vitro.\r"

[Smithies, O., Gregg, R.G., Boggs, S.S., Koralewski, M.A. & Kucherlapati, R.S. (1985) Nature (London) 317, 230-234] reported the targeted integration of DNA into the human beta-globin locus on chromosome 11 in a mouse erythroleukemia-human cell hybrid. These hybrid cells can undergo erythroid differentiation leading to greatly increased mouse and human beta-globin synthesis. By transfection of these hybrid cells with a plasmid carrying a modified human beta-globin gene and a foreign gene composed of the coding sequence of the bacterial neomycin-resistance gene linked to simian virus 40 transcription signals (SVneo), cells were obtained in which the two genes are integrated at the beta-globin locus on human chromosome 11 or at random sites. When we examined the response of the integrated genes to cell differentiation, we found that the genes inserted at the beta-globin locus were induced during differentiation, whereas randomly positioned copies were not induced. Even the foreign SVneo gene was inducible when it had been integrated at the beta-globin locus. The results show that genes introduced at the beta-globin locus acquire some of the regulatory properties of globin genes during erythroid differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Developmental aspects of an animal model of myotonia, the mouse mutant called \"arrested development of righting response\" (ADR phenotype), were studied. Adult ADR muscle is characterized by a low chloride conductance of the membrane, leading to hyperexcitability, and by a low parvalbumin content. The myotonic hyperexcitability (as measured by the extent of \"aftercontractions\") of ADR muscle increased steeply between postnatal days 9 and 18, by which time it had approached the adult level. To study the tissue autonomy of the myotonic phenotype, muscle grafts were performed in all four combinations between ADR and wildtype (WT phenotype) donors and hosts. In most experiments, the relative contributions of donor and host to the regenerated muscles were determined by an allelic marker (glucose phosphate isomerase). In WT and ADR hosts, ADR grafts showed myotonic responses that in WT nude mouse hosts were incomplete and similar to those of juvenile ADR muscle. In no case did grafts from WT donors show any myotonia. This shows that the myotonic ADR phenotype is based on an intrinsic muscle property most likely related to the plasma membrane. The parvalbumin contents of grafted muscles, when compared with those of untransplanted muscles, indicated graft-host interaction in the expression of this secondary phenotypic property.\r"

Findings reported here indicate that two progenitors of the five linked genes existed by the time of the eutherian (placental mammal)-metatherian (marsupial mammal) split and that these two genes were already differentiated with respect to their promoter regions and developmental expression. Southern blot and sequence analyses of the hemoglobin beta-chain genes of the opossum (Didelphis virginiana) revealed only two genes, one with coding and promoter sequences similar to eutherian prenatally expressed epsilon, gamma, and eta genes and the other coding for adult opossum hemoglobin beta-chains and having eutherian adult beta-type promoters. The most parsimonious arrangement of greater than 80 beta-globin exon sequences depicts the opossum embryonic-type gene as orthologously related to eutherian epsilon, gamma, and eta genes and the opossum adult-type gene as orthologously related to delta and beta genes. These data further indicate that after the initial beta duplication in the stem of Mammalia, the locus that became developmentally delayed in its expression evolved at a faster rate than the locus that became embryonically expressed.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated that in the transformed CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell a substantial part of the genome behaves as though its genes are sequestered from effective contact with soluble constituents of the intracellular fluid. The reverse transformation reaction, initiated by cAMP derivatives, causes this cell to regain the morphology, growth regulation, surface characteristics, and sensitivity of its DNA to digestion by DNase I that are characteristic of normal fibroblasts. In this paper we show that this action of cAMP is gene specific. In examination of 47 different genetic loci, some, like ribosomal RNA genes, are found to be sensitive to DNase I hydrolysis both in the absence and in the presence of cAMP; some are resistant under both conditions; and some are resistant in the untreated cell but become sensitive after cAMP treatment. Unlike other gene exposure reactions, which are irreversible and connected with differentiation phenomena, that produced by cAMP is readily reversed when the reagent is removed. A sequence of events is observed after cAMP treatment, the first of which is reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Afterwards, metabolic changes occur over periods as long as 72 hr. The cAMP-induced cytoskeleton-mediated gene exposure reaction appears to be an important genetic regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells and to have special implications for cancer.\r"

We have constructed a vector for Bordetella species that contains the PT promoter fused to the coding region of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, and we have used it to identify the regulatory elements involved in the transcription of the PT operon. Efficient transcription of these genes requires at least two features: (i) the 170-base-pair DNA sequence upstream from the start site of transcription and (ii) a trans-activating factor encoded by the vir locus. Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica, although endowed with a functional trans-activating system, do not produce PT because of mutations within their PT promoter regions. In contrast, phase III Bordetella species do not show any trans activity.\r"

Sciara coprophila salivary gland cells were exposed to five low-frequency (1.5-72 Hz) electromagnetic signals: three signals (1.5, 15, and 72 Hz) produced pulsed asymmetric electromagnetic fields and two signals (60 and 72 Hz) were sinusoidal. Subsequent analyses of two-dimensional gels showed that cell exposure to either type of low-frequency electromagnetic field resulted in both qualitative and quantitative changes in patterns of protein synthesis. Thus, signals producing diverse waveform characteristics induced previously undetectable polypeptides, some of which were signal specific and augmented or suppressed other polypeptides as compared with nonexposed cells. The pattern of polypeptide synthesis differed from that seen with heat shock: only five polypeptides in cells exposed to electromagnetic signals overlap those polypeptides exposed to heat shock, and the suppression of protein synthesis characteristic of heat shock does not occur.\r"

  ".W": "Nuclear fusion in newly formed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii zygotes can be inhibited by drugs that affect microtubule stability, which include colchicine, amiprophosmethyl, oryzalin, and taxol. This inhibition can be monitored genetically by the production of haploid meiotic products from conjugations between haploid and diploid parents. Such zygotes would normally produce aneuploid progeny. Inhibition of nuclear fusion by colchicine requires treatment of gametic cells both before conjugation and after formation of the zygotes. These results suggest that nuclear fusion requires dynamic microtubules. Treated zygotes formed from a haploid-diploid mating can produce six spores, but only four spores germinate to form viable haploid colonies. No contribution from the nuclear genome of the haploid parent is recovered, whereas all loci from the diploid parent are recovered. The four viable products from the diploid parent of inhibited zygotes show normal segregation of loci located on linkage groups segregating according to Mendelian laws. Levels of meiotic recombination were tested for pairs of loci on linkage groups XVIII and XIX and found to be unchanged by inhibition of nuclear fusion. Thus, similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C. reinhardtii mating-type functions necessary for nuclear fusion are not nuclear limited and can act through the cytoplasm. Inhibition of nuclear fusion can be used to analyze diploid Chlamydomonas that cannot enter meiosis. This technique permits direct analysis of dominant mutations, dominant suppressors and enhancers, and new alleles of identified loci that have been isolated in diploid strains.\r"

Ashkenazi Jews are found to be carriers for a severe type of Tay-Sachs disease, the classic form, 10 times more frequently than the general population. Ashkenazi Jewish patients with classic Tay-Sachs disease have appeared to be clinically and biochemically identical, and the usual assumption has been that they harbor the same alpha-chain mutation. In this study I have isolated the alpha-chain gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient, GM2968, with classic Tay-Sachs disease and compared its nucleotide sequences with that of the normal alpha-chain gene in the promoter region, exon and splice junction regions, and polyadenylylation signal area. Only one difference was observed between these sequences: at the 5' boundary of intron 12, a guanosine in the conserved splice junction dinucleotide sequence G-T had been altered to a cytidine. The alteration is presumed to be functionally significant and to result in aberrant mRNA splicing. Utilizing the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the region encompassing the mutation, I developed an assay to screen patients and heterozygote carriers for this mutation. Surprisingly, in each of two Ashkenazi patients, only one alpha-chain allele harbored the splice junction mutation. Only one parent of each of these patients was positive for the defect. Another Ashkenazi patient did not bear this mutation at all nor did either of the subject's parents. In addition, 30% of obligate heterozygotes tested carried the splice junction mutation, whereas 20 Ashkenazi Jews designated noncarriers by enzymatic assay were negative for this alteration. The data are consistent with the presence of more than one mutation underlying the classic form of Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.\r"

This cell-surface determinant is carried on a glycoprotein of 90 kDa, designated gp90. Mice were immunized with a partially purified preparation of gp90 derived from SK-MEL-131 clone 1.5, and three murine hybridomas (KF23, KF26, and KF104) secreting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) detecting this antigen have been generated. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the three mAbs and human FD serum react with the same gp90 species. The mAbs, in contrast to FD serum, react with a broad range of cultured cells in assays for cell-surface antigens and immunoprecipitate a gp90 component from radiolabeled extracts of these cells, including autologous FD B cells. We conclude that gp90 from SK-MEL-131 has two types of determinants: restricted (detected by FD serum) and common (detected by the mouse mAbs). gp90 molecules from cell lines other than SK-MEL-131 carry only the common determinant(s). Immunoperoxidase analysis of frozen tissue sections with mAb KF23 demonstrated a restricted gp90 expression in normal tissues (capillary endothelial cells, duct epithelium in sweat glands, breast, and pancreas). Melanomas and sarcomas showed strong gp90 expression, suggesting up-regulation of gp90 synthesis in certain human cancers.\r"

Comparison of 15 HLA-A with 20 HLA-B molecules reveals considerable locus-specific character, due primarily to differences at polymorphic residues. The results indicate that genetic exchange between alleles of the same locus has been a more important mechanism in the generation of HLA-A, -B, and -C diversity than genetic exchange events between alleles of different loci.\r"

Since 10B concentrations were approximately equal to 3-fold higher in blood than in cerebral parenchyma during the reactor irradiations, more radiation from alpha and 7Li particles was absorbed by brain endothelial cells than by brain parenchymal cells. Comparison of the LD50 dose for CNS radiation lethality from the reactor experiments with the LD50 dose from the x-ray experiments gives results compatible with morphologic evidence that endothelial cell damage is a major determinant of acute lethality from the CNS radiation syndrome.

  ".W": "Because of the putative rule of phospholipid methyltransferase reactions in many important membrane and receptor translocation processes, we studied the effect of methyltransferase inhibitors on acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) turnover in cultured rat skeletal muscle. Inhibition of methyltransferase significantly reduced the normal rate of degradation of AcChoRs, a process that involves endocytosis. Further, under conditions that greatly accelerate the rate of degradation of AcChoRs--i.e., by addition of anti-AcChoR antibody--methyltransferase inhibitors again significantly reduced receptor turnover. AcChoR synthesis was unaffected. Thus, the net effect of this treatment was slowing of the antibody-induced loss of surface AcChoRs. That this drug effect was mediated specifically by inhibition of methylation reactions was suggested by certain additional pharmacologic features: partial reversibility of the effect by methionine, enhancement by homocysteine, and correspondence with marked inhibition of phospholipid methylation. The substrate specificity of the methyltransferase inhibitors capable of reducing AcChoR degradation suggests that phospholipid methylation reactions may be most relevant. Methyltransferase inhibitor drugs may provide a therapeutic strategy in receptor disorders such as myasthenia gravis, in which accelerated receptor endocytosis plays a major role.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen free radicals have been demonstrated to be important mediators of postischemic reperfusion injury in a broad variety of tissues; however, the cellular source of free radical generation is still unknown. In this study, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements with the spin trap 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate that bovine endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation become potent generators of superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals. A prominent DMPO-OH signal aN = aH = 14.9 G is observed on reoxygenation after 45 min of anoxic incubation. Quantitative measurements of this free radical generation and the time course of radical generation are performed. Both superoxide dismutase and catalase totally abolish this radical signal, suggesting that O2 is sequentially reduced from O2-. to H2O2 to OH.. Addition of ethanol resulted in trapping of the ethoxy radical, further confirming the generation of OH.. Endothelial radical generation was shown to cause cell death, as evidenced by trypan blue uptake. Radical generation was partially inhibited and partially scavenged by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. Marked inhibition of radical generation was observed with the potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol. These studies demonstrate that endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation, conditions observed in ischemic and reperfused tissues, generate a burst of superoxide-derived hydroxyl free radicals that in turn cause cell injury and cell death. Most of this free radical generation appears to be from the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Thus, endothelial cell free radical generation may be a central mechanism of cellular injury in postischemic tissues.\r"

  ".W": "The electrophysiological properties of A9 L cells stably transfected with m1 muscarinic receptor cDNA were examined by using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. In current-clamp recordings, acetylcholine (AcCho) elicited a hyperpolarization of all transfected cells studied but had no effect on nontransfected A9 L cells. In voltage-clamp recordings, AcCho elicited an outward current at -50 mV accompanied by an increase in conductance. The onset of the current response was consistently delayed by several seconds with respect to the onset of the application of AcCho and could not be accounted for by diffusion. The AcCho-induced currents were reversibly inhibited by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1 microM) but were unaffected by the nicotinic receptor antagonist tubocurarine (50 microM). Ion-substitution experiments replacing K+ with N-methyl-D-glucamine and Cl- with methanesulfonate indicated that the current was carried mainly by K+, although a minor part appeared to be carried by Cl-. The AcCho-induced current could be blocked by the K+ channel blocking agents tetraethylammonium ion, 4-aminopyridine, apamin, and Ba2+ but not by Cs+. The AcCho-induced current was inhibited when 5 mM 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) was included in the patch pipette or when extracellular Cd2+ or Co2+ was applied, indicating a role for intracellular Ca2+ in the generation of the response. Thus, these results show that cloned m1 muscarinic receptors expressed in A9 L cells can activate a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance, possibly via a second-messenger system.\r"

  ".U": "88234559\r", 
  ".W": "kappa opioid receptors (kappa receptors) have been characterized in homogenates of guinea pig and rat brain under in vitro binding conditions. kappa receptors were labeled by using the tritiated prototypic kappa opioid ethylketocyclazocine under conditions in which mu and delta opioid binding was suppressed. In the case of guinea pig brain membranes, a single population of high-affinity kappa opioid receptor sites (kappa sites; Kd = 0.66 nM, Bmax = 80 fmol/mg of protein) was observed. In contrast, in the case of rat brain, two populations of kappa sites were observed--high-affinity sites at low density (Kd = 1.0 nM, Bmax = 16 fmol/mg of protein) and low-affinity sites at high density (Kd = 13 nM, Bmax = 111 fmol/mg of protein). To test the hypothesis that the high- and low-affinity kappa sites represent two distinct kappa receptor subtypes, a series of opioids were tested for their abilities to compete for binding to the two sites. U-69,593 and Cambridge 20 selectively displaced the high-affinity kappa site in both guinea pig and rat tissue, but were inactive at the rat-brain low-affinity site. Other kappa opioid drugs, including U-50,488, ethylketocyclazocine, bremazocine, cyclazocine, and dynormphin (1-17), competed for binding to both sites, but with different rank orders of potency. Quantitative light microscopy in vitro autoradiography was used to visualize the neuroanatomical pattern of kappa receptors in rat and guinea pig brain. The distribution patterns of the two kappa receptor subtypes of rat brain were clearly different. The pattern of rat high-affinity kappa sites paralleled that of guinea pig in the caudate-putamen, mid-brain, central gray substance of cerebrum, and substantia nigra; interspecies differences were apparent throughout most of the rest of the brain. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence for the presence of two kappa receptor subtypes; the U-69,593-sensitive, high-affinity kappa 1 site predominates in guinea pig brain, and the U-69,593-insensitive, low-affinity kappa 2 site predominates in rat brain.\r"

  ".W": "The Retzius neuron from the leech, growing in culture on the plant lectin concanavalin A as substrate, produces broad flat growth cones and thick bundles of processes. The same cell extends fine straight processes with numerous branches when grown on a laminin-like substrate extracted from leech central nervous system extracellular matrix, referred to as \"leech laminin extract.\" Cells growing on these two different substrates also show marked differences in the pattern of Ca2+ entry following evoked impulses, as detected optically by local changes in absorbance of the Ca2+-sensitive dye arsenazo III. Ca2+ enters the soma and initial segment of Retzius cells grown on both substrates. However, detectable Ca2+ entry only occurs into the processes of cells growing on leech laminin but not of those growing on concanavalin A. Optical recordings of changes in membrane potential made with the voltage-sensitive dye RH 155 taken from cells growing on either substrate indicate that a depolarization initiated in the soma spreads to the most distant processes with little or no distortion in amplitude or time course. This implies that all voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane are equally activated by depolarizing stimuli. Therefore, the fact that impulses evoke Ca2+ entry into processes of Retzius cells grown on leech laminin extract but not of cells grown on concanavalin A shows that the nature of the growth substrate can affect the number and distribution of their functional Ca2+ channels.\r"

Quinolinate's immediate biosynthetic enzyme, 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxygenase (EC 1.13.11.6), has now been detected in human brain tissue. The activity of 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxygenase is increased in Huntington disease brains as compared to control brains. The increment is particularly pronounced in the striatum, which is known to exhibit the most prominent nerve-cell loss in Huntington disease. Thus, the Huntington disease brain has a disproportionately high capability to produce the endogenous \"excitotoxin\" quinolinic acid. This finding may be of relevance for clinical, neuropathologic, and biochemical features associated with Huntington disease.\r"

  ".W": "Botulinum neurotoxins (types A and B), which are microbial proteins consisting of two disulfide-linked chains, inhibit specifically and with high potency the release of acetylcholine from peripheral nerve terminals. As a prerequisite for a long-term development of effective treatments for botulism, the internalization and inhibitory action of the toxin and its constituent chains were examined by electrophysiological methods at identified synapses in Aplysia preparations that allow both intracellular and bath application of the neurotoxins. Intracellular recordings from cholinergic cells of the buccal ganglion demonstrated that extra- or intracellular application of low doses of botulinum neurotoxin results in a specific blockade of evoked transmitter release, without changing the quantal size; an intraneuronal site of action has thus been established. In contrast, release from noncholinergic neurons of cerebral ganglion was prevented by the neurotoxin only after injection into the cell. Purified preparations of the individual renatured chains, shown to be nontoxic in a mouse bioassay, failed to affect acetylcholine release when applied extra- or intracellularly. However, inhibition of release was observed after intracellular administration of both chains or when the light chain was injected and the heavy chain was bath-applied. These findings show that both chains are required on the cytosolic side of the neuronal plasma membrane for expression of toxicity and that the cholinergic specificity of the neurotoxin is attributable to its heavy chain, which mediates targeting and subsequent neuronal uptake.\r"

  ".U": "88234567\r", 
  ".W": "We have recently shown that hydrolysis of labeled angiotensin I in canine brainstem homogenate causes a rapid accumulation of the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]. Although this angiotensin fragment has no vasopressor activity, its consistent generation in brain homogenate led us to study its potential neurosecretory effects in the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS) in vitro. Ang-(1-7) or angiotensin II (Ang II) was added to HNS perifusate in concentrations of 0.04, 0.4, and 4 microM, and release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) during each treatment was quantified as a percentage of the AVP release detected in the preceding collection period. Base-line release of AVP averaged 281 +/- 47 pg per 15 min (mean +/- SEM) in HNS explants (five experiments, five explants per chamber) perifused in Krebs solution at 37 degrees C, after a 1-hr equilibration period. At 0.04 microM, Ang II or Ang-(1-7) did not stimulate AVP release. Ang II increased AVP release over the control value by 172% +/- 44% and 268% +/- 66% at 0.4 and 4 microM, respectively; the same concentrations of Ang-(1-7) increased AVP release by 134% +/- 12% and 216% +/- 45%. The responses to Ang II and Ang-(1-7) at the highest concentration were both significant (P less than 0.05), and comparison by two-way analysis of variance indicated that Ang II and Ang-(1-7) were equipotent in stimulating AVP release over the range of concentrations studied. In the presence of the competitive Ang II antagonist [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II (20 microM), the release of AVP increased approximately equal to 2-fold. Neither Ang II nor Ang-(1-7) (4 microM) caused a further enhancement of AVP release in the presence of [Sar1,Thr8]Ang II. These data suggest that a hydrophobic residue in position 8 of the angiotensin peptide is not essential for activation of angiotensin receptors in the rat HNS. Moreover, the equipotence of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) indicates that Ang-(1-7) may participate in the control of AVP release.\r"

Using chi-square analysis, significant changes (p less than or equal to .01) were found in the number of entry-level programs offering instruction in joint mobilization techniques and in the interest in initiating or expanding relevant course work. In the survey of practicing physical therapists, the increase in the number of therapists who have had instruction in mobilization techniques was also found to be significant (p less than or equal to .01). These results would seem to indicate that mobilization techniques are becoming more widely used by physical therapists to treat joint dysfunction and that entry-level physical therapy education programs are making an attempt to prepare students by expanding curricula.\r"

Quadriceps femoris and hamstring musculature strengths of both legs were measured at follow-up with an isokinetic dynamometer, and peak torque values were recorded at lower (60 degrees/sec) and higher (180 degrees/sec) speeds. Maximal isometric extension and flexion outputs were measured at a 60-degree knee-flexion angle. Three standardized knee-scoring scales were used to determine the overall outcome of the ACLIK. High intersubject variability of the HQ ratios (range = 23%-205%) was observed in all strength tests, including tests of healthy knees. The injured knee of all subjects had a higher HQ ratio (46%-95%) in every test than the healthy knee (42%-85%). The HQ ratio difference between knees was significant at the isokinetic higher speed (p less than .05) and for the total-work (p less than .05) tests because of the weak quadriceps femoris muscle of the injured knee. Outcome scores did not differ significantly between the groups with low, optimal, or high HQ ratios of the ACLIK but were significantly better in subjects whose HQ ratio of the injured knee was similar to that of their uninjured knee.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The maximal load test required subjects to maintain a standing position against static loads applied at the waist (sagittal and frontal planes). Maximal loads were recorded as a percentage of body weight at the point when subjects could no longer hold the initial standing position. Effects of mechanical and cognitive factors were minimized in the maximal load test. Hemiparetic subjects had significantly lower maximal loads and clinical balance scores than both normal subject groups. Maximal loads of the young and older normal subjects were comparable, but the older subjects had lower clinical scores than the young subjects. Low correlations between subjects' scores on the two tests imply that each test yielded different information about static balance.

One physical therapist tested hip and knee extension, elbow flexion, and shoulder abduction in each child bilaterally. A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to analyze differences between measurements taken within and across the testing sessions. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were determined on mean values across the testing sessions for each variable. No significant differences (p greater than .05) between measurements taken within or across testing sessions were found in either the Dystrophic Group or the Healthy Group. Correlation coefficients for the Dystrophic Group ranged from .83 to .99 for the variables tested. Correlation coefficients for the Healthy Group ranged from .74 to .99.

In patients who have real or impending hemorrhage from the heart or great vessels associated with infection, strong consideration should be given to the intrathoracic transposition of an extrathoracic muscle.\r"

Two patients underwent reexploration for postoperative hemorrhage, possibly due to treatment with low-molecular-weight dextran. No vessel spasm was observed, compared with a 28 percent incidence in our adult series of 154 patients. The vessels were in pristine condition. Operative time was shorter (6.1 hours) than in our adult series (9.7 hours). Average hospital stay was 10 days (compared to 23 days for adults). All children have resumed almost normal activity within 2 months (4 months for adults). Results of this study indicate that microvascular free-tissue transfer can be accomplished safely and expeditiously in children. Care should be taken in preoperative and postoperative planning, however, especially concerning immobilization.\r"

A seven-point Likert scale was used to rate slides of normal and Down syndrome faces on four dimensions. Down syndrome patients were seen as less attractive, intelligent, good-hearted, and socially appealing than normal individuals. The slides were in nonapparent order and contained preoperative and 1-year postoperative views of eight plastic surgical patients. Paired t tests were used to examine operative changes, and all four dimensions showed overall postoperative improvement (p less than 0.001), but case-to-case variation was considerable. A linear relationship was found between change in appearance ratings and change in intelligence ratings. Findings suggest that when improvements in facial appearance are realized, peer normal social perceptions of the Down syndrome child may be enhanced. The relationship between school placement, intellectual level, and surgical decision making is discussed.\r"

In this report, we describe our approach from five patients we have treated and followed for 6 to 24 months with abnormalities characteristic of unilateral and bilateral lambdoid synostosis. We describe our approach to the simultaneous correction of frontal, occipital, and abnormal vertical height skeletal abnormalities in one operative procedure. To date, no negative neurologic sequelae have resulted from this operative approach, but significant improvement in skull form has been appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "A systematic approach to the various common aesthetic problems of the lower lateral cartilages is presented. Since this approach and technique may be applied to a wide variety of problems, we have taken the liberty of calling this the universal tip. These concepts have emerged from study of the literature and have evolved over the past thousand rhinoplasties. A classification of lower lateral cartilage problems includes five basic variations: (1) the wide, amphorous, ill-defined tip, (2) insufficient projection of the tip, (3) overprojection of the tip, (4) dependent tip with lack of definition, and (5) asymmetrical tip. It is important to realize that any of these five categories may be found in various combinations with each other. The details and fundamental steps of this universal tip technique are presented along with illustrative case examples in each of the five basic variations. In approximately 4 percent of patients there is a postoperative asymmetry in the position of cartilaginous flaps in the region of the dome of the lower lateral cartilage. These abnormalities plus abnormal ridges or bossa can usually be corrected at the time of secondary surgery under local anesthesia.\r"

However, there seems to be a growing consensus that judicious partial resection of the inferior turbinates is associated with a higher long-term success rate (86 versus 69 percent) as well as a lower postoperative morbidity rate. This paper outlines the specific symptom complex that brought 200 patients to corrective intranasal surgery. These are as follows: nasal obstruction (99 percent), sinus pressure headaches (61 percent), dry, raw pharynx (61 percent), abnormal migration of the nasal mucous blanket or \"postnasal drip\" (35 percent), and recurrent bacterial rhinosinusitis (57 percent). Based on this symptom complex, this paper attempts to give the expected long-term results when a single operator performed 100 consecutive operations using each technique.\r"

Cosmetic considerations in the scalp and forehead region limit the use of a flap design that requires a skin graft for a donor defect. On sound geometric principles, the classical flap designs are suitably modified here to have a somewhat equal proportion of transposition and rotation. This \"modified rotation flap\" design works to a maximum advantage in the inextensible region of the scalp and forehead by providing single-stage primary closure of moderate to large defects. No backcuts are ever necessary with this flap design. Use of this principle to modify the rotation flap design for closure of an extended midline forehead defect following rhinoplasty allows a still wider (up to 6.5 cm) midline forehead flap to be available for rhinoplasty with primary closure of the donor defect.\r"

This method has been utilized in six patients, and there has been no recurrence of the defect or evidence of a lumbar hernia. The follow-up has been from 7 to 66 months.

Since laser surgery has been shown to be effective in reducing incisional inflammatory reactions, hypertrophic scarring, and postoperative pain and edema, in achieving better hemostasis, the application of the carbon dioxide laser may be a more efficient surgical tool than the steel scalpel for carpal tunnel release. In 46 cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, the carbon dioxide laser was utilized to vaporize the transverse carpal ligament and seal its edges. The patients were then reevaluated at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. No intraoperative complications were encountered. Patients reported minimal postoperative pain, rapid return of sensibility, decreased paresthesia, and increased motor function. After 2 years, there have been no recurrent symptoms of median nerve compression in these patients.\r"

We have postulated that resistance to warm ischemia varies in different regions of the gut. An experiment was carried out in 10 mongrel dogs in which 10-cm segments of proximal, middle, and distal small bowel were isolated on single vascular pedicles. In each portion of the gut there were three segments: a control, a segment subjected to 60 minutes of warm ischemia, and a segment subjected to 120 minutes of warm ischemia. The following day each animal was reexplored, and the viability of bowel segments was assessed visually and with fluorescein. All control segments were viable at 24 hours. Twenty segments were subjected to 1 hour of warm ischemia, and all but two were viable. Nineteen gut segments were subjected to 2 hours of warm ischemia. Seven of eight proximal segments were viable, two of five midsegments were viable, and zero of six distal segments were viable. Survival in the distal portion compared to the proximal portion was significantly less (p less than 0.01). It appears from this study that isolated distal small bowel segments are less resistant to warm ischemia than proximal segments.\r"

In the 3 years between the initial formulation of the AIDS budget and its execution, there were numerous revisions and evidence of poor communication between scientists and policy makers. On the basis of this analysis, two recommendations are made: the director of the National Institutes of Health and the heads of other U.S. Public Health Service agencies should have discretionary funds to use for AIDS activities; and better channels of communication between the Congress, the Public Health Service, and outside biomedical researchers should be established for consultation on priorities for AIDS research.\r"

In this series of 147 episodes (an annual incidence of 0.8 episodes/10,000 adults), overall mortality was 25.9%. Factors significantly related to a higher mortality rate were shock, respiratory insufficiency, preexisting renal failure, and rapidly fatal underlying disease. Several laboratory abnormalities-such as a low percentage of band forms, an elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase, and hyperbilirubinemia-were significantly related to a poor outcome. Multilobar pneumonia and meningitis were both associated with high mortality, although not to a statistically significant degree. Discriminant analysis showed the presence of shock as the most powerful predictive factor of death. Surprisingly, prior splenectomy did not correlate with higher mortality. Treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics favorably influenced the outcome of illness in patients with ultimately fatal and nonfatal underlying disease, while the use of these agents in patients with rapidly fatal underlying disease did not correlate significantly with a good prognosis.\r"

No association was found between overall measles mortality and size of household or number of measles cases in a household. When the analysis was confined to patients less than 3 years of age (i.e., those most likely to die), measles mortality was strongly associated with the occurrence of more than five measles cases in a household. Intensive exposure to measles virus may, therefore, be a secondary risk factor for death following measles. Reducing measles mortality by altering social patterns and elevating socioeconomic status to reduce exposure to the virus is beyond the scope of most public health programs. Age-appropriate immunization, therefore, remains the principal strategy for preventing death following measles.\r"

Under the mortality conditions of the period studied, a 6-month-old child has a 15% chance of dying from measles at some point. Children with siblings have a higher mortality risk during measles epidemics than children without siblings. Since the risk of infection seems equal in these two groups, the difference is probably due to more severe infection among multiple cases with close contact. In one epidemic where measles cases were registered, case-fatality rates were indeed higher in compounds with several measles cases.\r"

In every case in which there was a death in a household with more than one case, it was the youngest patient who died. All children with secondary cases who died had a pre-illness weight-for-height status above the population mean. Measles mortality in Bangladesh appears to be determined by three factors: age, superinfections, and having a secondary case. The last two factors may be due to increased intrafamilial exposure to both the measles virus and the superinfecting pathogens.\r"

The shape of retinal neurons that accumulate dopamine has been demonstrated in an in vitro preparation of cat retina. This was achieved by the discovery that the combined uptake of dopamine and the indoleaminergic transmitter analog 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine leads to an intense, catecholamine-like fluorescence in the cell bodies and processes of presumed dopaminergic amacrine cells in the living retina. This fluorescence served as an in vitro marker for these cells, and their detailed morphology was analyzed after intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase under direct microscopic control. The horseradish peroxidase-filled cells show an unprecedented neuronal morphology: each cell gives rise to multiple, axon-like processes that arise from, and extend for millimeters beyond, the dendritic tree. The unique structure of this type of amacrine cell suggests a function for dopamine in long-range lateral interactions in the inner plexiform layer.\r"

The hormone is also known to modify transfollicular K+ fluxes and is now shown to cause increased intraoocytic K+ activity (aK). The hormone's effect on aK was duplicated by microinjecting K+ salts into oocytes which were incubated in paraffin oil. This treatment mimicked the influence of gonadotropin on both the rate of protein synthesis and the synthesis of specific polypeptides. These findings suggest that gonadotropin-stimulated oocyte growth is attributable largely to the hormone's influence on transfollicular K+ fluxes. They support the hypothesis that the K+ flux and aK changes observed during cell activation are critical in causing subsequent increases in protein synthesis and growth.\r"

As a sole energy substrate, lactate supported normal synaptic function in rat hippocampal slices for hours without any sign of deterioration. Slices that were synaptically silent as a result of glucose depletion could be reactivated with lactate to show normal synaptic function. When slices were exposed to the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetic acid, lactate-supported synaptic function was unaffected, whereas that supported by glucose was completely abolished. This indicated that lactate was metabolized directly via pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, under conditions that lead to lactate accumulation (cerebral ischemia) this \"end product\" may be a useful alternative as a substrate for energy metabolism.\r"

This preference was reversed in B6 males fostered by B6-H-2k parents and in B6-H-2k males fostered by B6 parents, preference in these cases favoring the same H-2 type. Thus, H-2 selective mating preference is acquired by imprinting on familial H-2 types.\r"

  ".W": "In situ hybridization with complementary DNA probes for nerve growth factor (NGF) was used to identify cells containing NGF messenger RNA in rat and mouse brain. The most intense labeling occurred in hippocampus, where hybridizing neurons were found in the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cell layer. The neuronal identity of NGF mRNA-containing cells was further assessed by a loss of NGF-hybridizing mRNA in hippocampal areas where neurons had been destroyed by kainic acid or colchicine. RNA blot analysis also revealed a considerable decrease in the level of NGF mRNA in rat dentate gyrus after a lesion was produced by colchicine. This lesion also caused a decrease in the level of Thy-1 mRNA and an increase in the level of glial fibrillary acidic protein mRNA. Neuronal death was thus associated with the disappearance of NGF mRNA. These results suggest a synthesis of NGF by neurons in the brain and imply that, in hippocampus, NGF influences NGF-sensitive neurons through neuron-to-neuron interactions.\r"

In this study, an isolate of HIV-2 from a patient in Senegal was molecularly cloned and characterized. This isolate (HIV-2ST) was shown by hybridization and restriction enzyme analysis to be more related to the prototype HIV-2ROD than to other human or primate retroviruses. Cultures of HIV-2ST showed genotypic polymorphism, and clones of the virus had transmembrane envelope glycoproteins of 30 and 42 kilodaltons. Unlike other immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-2ST did not cause cell death or induce cell fusion in peripheral blood lymphocytes or in any of four CD4+ cell lines tested. Although HIV-2ST entered cells by a CD4-dependent mechanism and replicated actively, cell-free transmission of the virus was retarded at the level of cell entry. These findings suggest that immunodeficiency viruses prevalent in West African populations are members of the HIV-2 virus group and that certain strains of this virus have attenuated virulence.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that ventricular ectopy was more prevalent and complex in hypertensive patients with LVH by electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria than in those without ECG evidence of LVH. The present study was designed to detect and quantify ventricular dysrhythmias in hypertensive patients with early concentric LVH by echocardiography but without LVH by ECG criteria. Continuous ambulatory ECG tracings were recorded for 24 hours in 94 patients with essential hypertension: 37 without LVH, 26 with concentric LVH by echocardiographic but not ECG criteria, and 31 with LVH on both echocardiography and ECG. Patients with LVH by ECG criteria had significantly more premature ventricular contractions (P less than .001) and more complex (higher Lown's class) ventricular ectopy (P less than .001) than hypertensives without LVH or with LVH only by echocardiographic criteria. Prevalence and complexity of ventricular ectopic activity, however, was not affected by mild to moderate concentric cardiac hypertrophy detected echocardiographically. We conclude that unlike LVH shown by ECG, early hypertensive concentric LVH detected echocardiographically is not associated with increased electrical irritability of the myocardium.\r"

To test this hypothesis I analyzed the results of 600 consecutive primary carotid endarterectomies that I performed over a 13-year period beginning with my senior residency. The overall hospital mortality was 9/600 (1.5%), the permanent neurologic morbidity 11/600 (1.8%), and the combined mortality and permanent neurologic morbidity 20/600 (3.3%). The mortality for the first 300 operations was 6/300 (2%) (4/6 from stroke) and for the last 300, 3/300 (1%) (3/3 cardiac). All 11 nonfatal strokes occurred in the first 300 operations. Morbidity and mortality decreased with both cumulative experience and the number of operations done per year. While it is difficult to separate the effect of these two factors, the results suggest that both may be important in obtaining a combined perioperative mortality and permanent neurologic deficit below 3%.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed the records of 508 consecutive carotid endarterectomies done by 19 surgeons during a five-year period in one medical center to evaluate postoperative complications (stroke and death). Each of 16 surgeons did 32 operations or fewer, with case loads ranging from one to 32. Three surgeons did 70, 98, and 172 respectively. The incidence of stroke among patients of the 16 surgeons combined who did 32 cases or fewer in five years (fewer than ten cases per year) was 7%, with a combined stroke and death rate of 8%; in contrast, patients of the combined surgeons who did more than 32 operations in five years (more than ten cases per year) had a stroke rate of 3%, with a combined stroke and death rate of 3%. When the carotid disease was examined separately, it was apparent that the adverse event rate among patients with asymptomatic or nonhemispheric disease accounted for the difference. Patients of surgeons with fewer cases had 18% adverse events, whereas those of more experienced surgeons had 2% adverse events. The adverse events were similar for both groups in patients with focal transient ischemic attacks or stroke. Seven of the 16 surgeons who did fewer than 32 cases had no patients who had stroke, despite the few carotid endarterectomies they had done. Thus, the stroke rate was somewhat lower in the hands of those surgeons who did endarterectomy more often, but the number of carotid endarterectomies done by a surgeon is not the only factor to decrease the stroke rate. Proper selection of patients and attention to risk factors and technique are essential.\r"

In summary, moderate caustic esophagitis is associated with esophageal dilatation, atony, and peristaltic abnormalities initially, and with eventual stricture formation.\r"

The major criticisms are that the physical examination lacks sensitivity for many common diseases and has not been subjected to the same scientific scrutiny afforded laboratory testing. On the positive side, the physical examination is a series of diagnostic maneuvers that permit physicians to test hypotheses generated during history taking, to determine disease severity, and to lessen clinical uncertainty. Furthermore, the physical examination fosters the development of personalized medical care and a bond of mutual trust between patient and doctor. The challenge for tomorrow is to determine the operating characteristics of physical examination techniques and the clinical utility of physical findings. For preclinical students, emphasis should be directed at basic examination principles and sequencing. Many model programs have used patient instructors and other innovative techniques. Clinical students and postgraduate trainees need emphasis on interpretation of physical findings and their integration into the clinical context. There is no substitute for bedside teaching at this level.\r"

In one of our patients, the \"active metabolite\" of that same drug could not duplicate the effect. Prevalence and mechanism require clarification. If even a small proportion of patients with the sustained erection phenomenon are found to progress to priapism, this would have profound ramifications. If this phenomenon could be confidently predicted or safely and readily implemented, the benefits for some patients with impotence or premature ejaculation might be considerable. Given all the potential adverse side effects of antipsychotics, it should be appreciated that the potential direct effects on male sexual function are not always adverse.\r"

Tumors of the autonomic system are common in children, whereas the nerve sheath tumors are more likely to be found in adults. The malignant lesions are almost always symptomatic and the benign lesions asymptomatic, except in the child, in whom a benign lesion may result in symptoms because of its size relative to the volume of the child's thorax. Intraspinal canal extension, although relatively infrequent, should be sought for in all paravertebral tumors, for a significant percentage of these may be initially asymptomatic. Excision of such an hourglass tumor without foreknowledge of such extension may lead to serious spinal cord complications. Surgical excision of most of these tumors is sufficient except for the malignant lesions, especially in infancy and childhood, for which the addition of postoperative irradiation and chemotherapy may be beneficial. The prognosis after the removal of benign neurogenic tumors of the thorax is excellent. In the infant or child with Stage III or IV neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, or an Askin tumor, the prognosis is poor. In the adult with a malignant neurogenic sarcoma or a malignant paraganglioma, the prognosis likewise is grave.\r"

Patients with gallstones had average serum amylase levels of 1,848 +/- 289 International units per liter and 911 +/- 233 International units per liter at hospital admission and on hospital day 2, respectively; these levels were significantly greater than those in either the alcoholic or other patients. In the group of patients with gallstones, there were also dramatic decreases in serum levels of amylase at 24 hours (1,425 +/- 286 International units) after hospital admission; these decreases were not seen in the other groups of patients. At operation, the patients with gallstones had mild or no pancreatitis. All of them underwent uneventful cholecystectomy within 48 hours of hospitalization; only three patients required exploration of the common duct, and only one patient had ampullary obstruction. We conclude that rapid resolution of high level hyperamylasemia within 24 hours of hospitalization in symptomatic patients with gallstones can help to identify patients whose amylase fluctuations are indeed gallstone related, who have either mild pancreatitis or none at all, are good candidates for early cholecystectomy and are not likely to have common duct stones.\r"

Three factors that predicted both the risk of recurrence and the disease-free interval were determined. These were thickness of tumor, the first definitive surgical treatment (whether or not the patient underwent elective dissection of lymph nodes) and the ulcerative state of the primary tumor. Follow-up schedules were designed taking all three of the factors into consideration. The schedules so derived reflected both the risk of recurrence and its alteration with time. It will obviously be necessary, however, to modify the frequency of follow-up visits according to the institutional resources available and the specific wishes of the patient. Annual review for an indefinite period for all patients with melanoma is recommended to detect both additional cancers and late recurrences.\r"

Although one patient had a fall in the serum level of CA 125 (the antigen marker of carcinoma of the ovary) with repeated courses of intraperitoneal therapy, there was little reduction in the bulky abdominal tumors. Even though intraperitoneal chemotherapy, as currently administered, does not appear to effect a significant reduction in tumor in women with bulky carcinoma of the ovary, it may be of benefit in improving the quality of life. Larger numbers of patients should be studied to better assess the role of this method of treatment in the palliative cure of patients with symptomatic malignant ascites.\r"

  ".U": "88236202\r", 
  ".W": "A new problem has arisen for surgeons now that the pectoralis major muscle is routinely left in place after mastectomy. When the pathologist reports a tumor close to the fascial margin, there has been uncertainty regarding the significance of this finding. In the present study, the histories of 346 women with negative nodes who underwent modified radical mastectomy and had an uninvolved plane under the breast were reviewed. The distance from tumor to fascia was recorded by the pathologist, and the patients were divided into \"Close\" and \"Not Close\" groups. The \"Close\" group (90 patients) had tumors within one low power field (4 millimeters) of the fascia while the \"Not Close\" group (256 patients) had tumors more than 4 millimeters from the fascial margin. Twelve of the patients had local recurrence within an average follow-up period of 47 months, and a variety of analyses failed to show a statistically significant difference in local recurrence rates between the two groups. The results of this study indicate that tumor to fascia margin, as recorded by the pathologist, is not a strong determinant of local recurrence provided the areolar plane between the breast and the underlying fascia appears uninvolved at the time of mastectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Increased hydrostatic pressure and microvascular permeability after acid aspiration as causes of pulmonary and tracheobronchial edema were studied. Eighteen dogs were anesthetized and 3.0 milliliters per kilogram of 0.1 normal hydrochloride instilled into the trachea. After one hour, the platelet count decreased 47,500 per cubic millimeter (p less than 0.05) from base line levels of 221,400 per cubic millimeter and platelet serotonin stores decreased from 2.09 to 1.65 micrograms per 10(9) platelets (p less than 0.05). Mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased progressively from a base line value of 11 to 21 millimeters of mercury four hours after acid instillation (p less than 0.05). Mean arterial pressure fluctuated from a high of 143 millimeters of mercury to the final value, at four hours, of 119 millimeters of mercury. Ketanserin, a serotonin receptor antagonist, infused one hour after acid injury did not prevent release of platelet 5 hydroxytryptamine but led to a 24 per cent decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure from 13 to 10 millimeters of mercury (p less than 0.05) and an 11 per cent decrease in mean arterial pressure from 135 to 120 millimeters of mercury (p less than 0.05). Nitroprusside produced a 30 per cent decrease in mean arterial pressure, but only a 20 per cent decline in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.05). Four hours after acid was instilled, untreated dogs produced 129 milliliters of edema fluid from the endotracheal tube. In proportion to the relative decline in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, nitroprusside therapy reduced the volume of edema to 72 milliliters (p less than 0.05) and ketanserin to 52 milliliters (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that 5 hydroxytryptamine contributes to the pulmonary hypertension associated with acid injury and that the volume of edema formed may be directly related to the increase in the hydrostatic pressure.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of our initial experience with the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble (American Edwards Laboratories) was undertaken to study its surgical complications. Between 22 February and 30 August 1986, 250 patients had 275 gastric bubbles endoscopically inserted as an adjuvant treatment for morbid obesity. Profiles of the first 104 patients revealed a mean weight of 113.0 kilograms (74 per cent above ideal body weight) and a mean weight loss of 10.1 kilograms (0.76 kilogram per week) followed by a gain of 0.48 kilogram from the period of peak weight loss at 13.7 weeks to removal at 19.4 weeks. Thirty-three per cent had endoscopic removal and the remainder passed per rectum. Ninety-two had undergone previous abdominal operation. Five instances of obstruction of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract (mean 18.3 weeks after insertion) required three operative removals, one endoscopic retrieval from the second portion of the duodenum and one hypaque small intestinal series with oral mineral oil to induce spontaneous passage. Four of the five patients had prior abdominal operations--cholecystectomy in one instance, appendectomy in one, cholecystectomy and appendectomy in one and exploratory laparotomy for multiple stab wounds in one. One (multiple stab wounds) had adhesions at the point of the obstruction. The patient who underwent endoscopic retrieval had premature deflation at 6.7 weeks presumably due to a defective bubble. The weight gain after peak weight loss at 13.7 weeks likely represents spontaneous bubble deflation. Prior abdominal surgical treatment appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of obstruction after bubble deflation. In addition, two of five patients have been lost to follow-up study after insertion. Proper patient selection and careful monitoring may be crucial in reducing the morbidity associated with the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble.\r"

Because part of the technique involves a \"blind\" dissection, it is important that the surgeon is completely familiar with the anatomic relations of the esophagus. A careful anatomic review of these relations was undertaken and important anatomic landmarks have been highlighted with the aid of anatomic dissection. Areas of anatomic fixation are found particularly at the tracheal bifurcation, the dome of the right pleura and the arch of the aorta. The right pleura also crosses the midline between the levels corresponding to the fifth and tenth thoracic vertebrae, and at the eighth thoracic vertebra, there is close proximity of pleurae. A better appreciation of these anatomic features will help the surgeon to decrease the morbidity of the transhiatal esophagectomy.\r"

Seventy-nine percent of patients with diminished preoperative visual acuity had postoperative improvement; none deteriorated. Endocrine remission of functioning tumors was achieved in 43% of patients and complete resection by computed tomography scanning was also obtained in 43%. There were no deaths in this series and the major complication was cerebrospinal fluid leak, which occurred in 3% of patients. Comparison with transfrontal surgery suggests that these results are as good as those with transfrontal procedures and that the incidence of serious side effects is considerably lower. Transsphenoidal surgery is safe and effective in the surgical management of large pituitary adenomas.\r"

To clarify the surgical management of patients with this tumor, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 202 patients with histologically proven abdominal lymphomas. Within this group, 36 patients underwent laparotomy before they had chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Ten patients were explored to establish a histologic diagnosis of lymphoma. The remaining 26 patients underwent laparotomy because of presumed benign disease. Twenty patients were found to have localized disease at laparotomy. Patients with localized disease demonstrated significantly better survival than patients with extranodal and nodal involvement (p less than 0.05). Four patients with local resection received no adjuvant therapy and were free of disease a median of 50 months after surgery.\r"

This study was done to determine whether an increase in LESP would occur during intravenous administration of exogenous PP at physiologic and pharmacologic doses and whether the integrity of vagal innervation would alter the response. Manometric observations were made, in each of five dogs, of the LESP before and during intravenous infusion of bovine PP at doses ranging from 0.05 to 10 micrograms/kg/hour. Blood samples were obtained simultaneously with LESP measurements for radioimmunoassay determinations of PP. The lowest dose of PP (0.05 microgram/kg/hour) did not produce an increase in either LES pressure or circulating levels of immunoreactive PP. At all other doses, a significant increase occurred in the LESPs and in plasma PP levels. Infusion of PP at 1.0 microgram/kg/hour produced levels of PP similar to those seen postprandially (300 to 400 pg/ml). After vagotomy, studies were repeated at doses ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 micrograms/kg/hour. Infusion of PP at 1.0 microgram/kg/hour produced PP levels similar to those seen in the prevagotomy period; however, there was no change in LES pressures from the fasting postvagotomy values. Administration of PP at 1.5, 2.0, and 5.0 micrograms/kg/hour did produce slight increases in LESP values, which were significantly less than those observed prevagotomy. These higher doses of PP postvagotomy also produced pharmacologic levels of plasma PP. These results demonstrate that an increase in LESP occurs when exogenous PP is administered at doses that produce physiologic levels of PP in dogs with intact vagi; vagotomy results in a marked attenuation of this response.\r"

Histologic confirmation of the diagnosis was obtained in 71% of patients. Seven patients received additional treatment with radical radiotherapy. The 30-day overall hospital mortality rate was 19%. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 57% and 33%, respectively. The quality of survival was usually good. The need for centralized referral and treatment of these difficult patients is stressed. The case against radical resection for this lesion is presented.

There are three general areas of difference from normal conditions in simulated microgravity: physical adaptation to gravity deprivation tissue behavior, including bleeding; and the conduct of surgery. Without gravity, the tactile \"feel\" of objects is changed (\"heavy\" and \"light\" are meaningless terms) and proprioception is confused so that there is past pointing and overreaching of movements. Tissue planes tend to separate, and organs float and bob in the operative field, which makes clamping, cutting, and suturing different. Bleeding is a major consideration; surface tension tends to keep venous blood oozing along surfaces, whereas pulsatile arterial blood forms droplets, streamers, and clouds, depending on the force of the bleeding. These factors and others interfere with surgical technique in a number of ways: dispersion of blood obscures the surgeon's vision, sutures become entangled, organs are not stabilized, and instruments float into the operative field. The limitations of comparing neutral buoyancy to the true zero gravity of space are addressed. There is a definite need for further investigation for development of new surgical techniques in preparation for experimental and clinical surgery in space.\r"

Of 10 patients found to have the presence of free retroperitoneal blood, six underwent immediate operation and five survived (83%). Delay in operation uniformly resulted in death. There was one false-positive study. Twelve patients demonstrated no extravascular fluid on initial computed tomography interpretation. Unsuspected nonvascular problems were found in six patients (40%). There was one false-negative study that resulted in a death. Clinical findings at initial examinations were similar in both groups. We conclude that in the hemodynamically stable patient, combining prompt computed tomography evaluation and immediate operation optimizes outcome in patients with leaking abdominal aortic aneurysms.\r"

  ".W": "Reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach occurs in patients with pyloric incompetence and after gastric resection when bile-diverting procedures are omitted. In such settings duodenal contents have been considered to favor the development of gastric cancer. We have studied the effect of chronic duodenogastric reflux on gastric tumor promotion in rats treated with N-methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in an experimental design that avoids physical trauma to the glandular stomach. Thus the effect of trauma-induced tissue repair on carcinogenesis is eliminated, and duodenogastric reflux is isolated as an experimental parameter. To achieve such reflux the first jejunal loop was anastomosed to the forestomach in rats. Animals were exposed to MNNG in drinking water (83 mg/L) for 12 weeks before induction of reflux. Experimental groups were as follow: I, reflux plus MNNG (n = 32); II, MNNG alone (n = 27); III, reflux alone (n = 28); IV, control (n = 25). The experiment was terminated after 56 weeks. Only animals that had survived for 90 days were included in the effective number of animals, which allowed for equal chances of tumor development. In no animal that died earlier had tumors developed. Animals with reflux plus MNNG treatment had significantly more glandular neoplasms (12/32) than did animals with MNNG treatment alone (4/27; p less than 0.05). Similarly, more animals with squamous cell neoplasms were recorded in group I (9/32) than in group II (2/27; p less than 0.05). In consideration of all tumors of epithelial and mesenchymal origin, more gastric malignant tumors were observed in group I (9/32) than in group II (2/27; p less than 0.05). It is concluded that chronic exposure to duodenal contents promotes the development of gastric neoplasia.\r"

Five dogs were studied with use of motilin, in doses ranging from 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/kg, and with use of morphine sulfate, in doses ranging from 2.5 to 80 micrograms/kg, administered by close intra-arterial injection to the proximal duodenum at 40% of the spontaneous migrating motor complex cycle. The minimum effective doses of motilin and morphine necessary to induce premature Phase III-like activity when given intravenously were also determined. Both motilin and morphine induced premature Phase III-like activity in the duodenum, the characteristics of which were similar to those of spontaneous Phase III except that the velocity of migration in morphine-induced Phase III-like activity was greater. The minimum effective dose of each agent was no different whether given intra-arterially or intravenously. The latencies of response to intra-arterial and intravenous administration of each agent were no different. Doses of morphine effective in inducing premature Phase III-like activity led to increases in plasma motilin concentration that occurred only after Phase III-like activity had begun in the duodenum. Our results suggest that humoral initiation of fasting motor activity in the duodenum by motilin and morphine does not occur by stimulation of receptors located within the wall of the duodenum.\r"

Fourteen adult baboons were anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated with room air. Left atrial and coronary sinus catheters were inserted surgically. Experimental animals (n = 7) were hemodiluted at constant left atrial pressure with 5% human serum albumin. Control animals (n = 7) underwent similar volume exchanges with fresh, cross-matched, homologous red blood cells resuspended in human serum albumin, also at constant left atrial pressure. Six of seven experimental animals survived until hematocrit levels were 4%. Adequate cardiac compensation was observed until hematocrit levels were less than 10%. Increased flow, without increases in the O2 extraction ratio, was the mechanism of compensation used by the healthy heart with patent coronary vessels.\r"

A test of surgical knowledge, with questions given in the form of analogies, was administered to 16 students in their fourth week of clerkship. While solving test items, students' eye movements and fixations were tracked. By analysis of the recordings, eight scores of information-processing capabilities were derived. The processing scores and conventional predictors of medical school clinical performance were analyzed to determine their power to predict success, defined by ratings given on a 1 to 10 scale by 21 faculty members based on three tests of cognitive knowledge, two performance-based examinations, and faculty reports. The ratings were reliable (generalizability coefficient = 0.72; p less than 0.001). Stepwise regression analysis of all variables selected one MCAT score (science problems) and two information-processing scores to the statistical model that maximally predicted success. Regression coefficient for the science problem subset of the MCAT was 0.42. This was augmented to R2 = 0.77 when information processing variables were included. The increment was significant, F (2, 11) = 9.25; p less than 0.01. A newly developed test, coupled with techniques that made possible the derivation of components of information processing, nearly doubled the power of conventional tests to predict success in surgical clerkship.\r"

Chronically instrumented, unrestrained, and unanesthetized sheep were subjected to a moderate degree of hemorrhagic shock and then resuscitated with a 2-minute infusion of 7.5% NaCl/6% dextran 70 in a volume of 5 ml/kg body weight. Infusions were made into the cephalic vein, the femoral artery, or, centrally, the superior vena cava. All three routes of injection promptly reestablished arterial pressure and cardiac output. All gave equivalently good restoration of plasma volume. None of the injections damaged the vessels, as determined either by gross inspection or by histologic examination. Thus the solution was safe and effective when given peripherally. It might be useful in the field resuscitation of hypovolemic patients.\r"

As shown by Irey et al., exogenous or endogenous female reproductive steroids can act on the vascular system as a target organ and induce intimal hyperplasia and thrombus formation. The effects of contraceptive estrogens and progestogens are discussed, but the catalytic effect of heavy cigarette smoking appears to be the factor that induces, in predisposed women with hyperplasia, thrombosis of visceral arteries. In this case report we want to emphasize that the association between smoking and oral contraceptives can cause cardiovascular disease in young women. Failure to recognize this fact could result in delayed diagnosis and worsen the prognosis.\r"

Statistical techniques that allow for the simultaneous evaluation of multiple factors indicated that retention of consciousness, decreasing age, and place of residence at the onset of the stroke were the strongest predictors of survival over 3 years. The survival rate for those living at home at the onset of the stroke who did not lose consciousness was 58% compared with 5% for people in institutional care who lost consciousness. Marital status, history of stroke, and ethnic group also predicted survival. Most of the important prognostic factors we identified in our study cannot be modified, testifying to the importance of the prevention of stroke in the first place.\r"

Angiography revealed a severe stenosis in association with the thrombus in 23 patients, a moderate stenosis in four patients, and, in the three patients with only minimal stenosis presumably due to atherosclerosis, there was evidence for a coagulopathy. Sixteen of the 30 patients were operated on urgently, 10 within 24 hours of detection of the thrombus. Twelve of these 16 surgical patients were given anticoagulation before surgery. At endarterectomy, thrombus was identified in 11 of the 14 surgical patients in whom the thrombus was accessible; the other two surgical patients had intracranial thrombus only. In this group, four of 11 surgical patients with accessible thrombi suffered perioperative episodes of new or larger infarction. Fourteen of the 30 patients initially received medical management with no complication. Eight of these 14 medical patients had repeat angiography; seven exhibited complete resolution of thrombus, and six of these seven patients subsequently underwent delayed endarterectomy for the stenosis. No thrombus was identified at surgery in any of the six. One of the six delayed surgery patients suffered a perioperative stroke. Although these numbers are small, reflecting the rarity of thrombus demonstrated by angiography, undetected thrombus is often found at endarterectomy. Its presence may increase operative risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Electrocardiograms were continuously recorded over an average of 5 days. A significant correlation was established between the clinical manifestations of brainstem compression and sinus arrhythmias, multifocal premature ventricular contractions, couplets, and ventricular tachycardias. An explanation for this correlation may be found in the localization of the autonomous cardiovascular centers in the hypothalamus and brainstem. Transtentorial herniation frequently leads to a bilateral lesion of these structures. However, the cardiac arrhythmias are only a partial phenomenon within a complex cardiovascular reaction.\r"

Although platelet aggregation was reduced significantly after 1 week, there was wide individual variation in the inhibition of platelet function in spite of marked decreases of serum thromboxane B2 concentrations by greater than 90% (from 224 +/- 58 to 8 +/- 8 ng/ml). There was no correlation between collagen-induced platelet aggregability and serum thromboxane B2 concentration before aspirin administration in the range 100-350 ng/ml, but after 1 week of repeated administration of aspirin, there was a correlation between platelet aggregability and serum thromboxane B2 concentrations of less than 25 ng/ml (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01). However, platelet inhibition was insufficient even in some patients with markedly decreased thromboxane B2 concentrations (less than 5 ng/ml). Our results suggest that individual variation of platelet aggregability in response to low-dose aspirin may be due to variation not only in the degree of inhibition of thromboxane A2 production but also in the relative dependence of platelet aggregation on extra-arachidonic pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Migraine is associated with increased platelet activity and an incidence of cerebrovascular ischemic events. Because cerebrovascular events might result from platelet aggregation, enhancing platelet activity further in the treatment of migraine is not desirable. beta-Adrenoceptor blockers effective in migraine prophylaxis include propranolol (nonselective) and metoprolol (beta 1-selective), but it is uncertain how beta-receptor subtype selectivity might influence platelet behavior in migraine. In 29 patients, comparable clinical responses were obtained with therapeutic doses during 1 month of treatment with propranolol, metoprolol, and the beta 2-selective Li 32-468. Propranolol increased and metoprolol decreased platelet aggregation and ATP release, and the effect of Li 32-468 could be related to that of propranolol. These actions can be largely explained in terms of what is known of platelet beta-receptors and therefore can be generalized to other effective beta-blockers. Since altered platelet activity does not account for the efficacy of these agents in migraine, the actions of beta-blockers on platelets should be considered as side effects. Those beta-blockers inhibiting platelet activity should be preferred in migraine treatment, assuming equal efficacy, which implies the use of beta 1-selective blockers.\r"

Eight had a ventricular-demand pacemaker, one had a dual-chamber pacemaker, and one had an atrial-inhibited pacemaker. Six patients were in atrial fibrillation at stroke onset, but none had atrial fibrillation when the pacemaker was inserted. Six patients were taking aspirin, and one was anticoagulated when stroke occurred. Stroke in sick sinus syndrome after pacemaker insertion is not rare, and pacing does not appear to be protective.

  ".U": "88236589\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the clinical significance of lucent defects in computed tomography (CT) scans of the cervical carotid artery plaque, we studied 95 patients with recent symptoms of hemispheric ischemia. Using multiple linear regression analysis, we estimated the strength of the association of symptoms with laterality of carotid artery lucent lesions, stenoses, and ulcerations observed in CT scans. Hemispheric symptoms correlated strongly with ipsilateral carotid lucent lesions (partial p less than 0.025) and with ipsilateral severe (greater than 75%) carotid stenosis (partial p less than 0.025). Carotid artery ulcerations had a weaker association (partial p less than 0.1), and stenoses of mild and moderate degrees showed none. The overall performance of all three plaque complications was highly significant (p less than 0.005). The lucent defect indicates a morphologic change in the carotid plaque that plays an important role in the development of symptoms of hemispheric ischemia. This is in agreement with the notion that the lucent defect is the image of intraplaque hemorrhage and/or necrosis, which are complications central to the development of symptomatic carotid disease.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigators have shown that free fatty acids that accumulate during ischemia are an indicator of evolution in ischemic brain damage. Our study describes the temporal relations between free fatty acid accumulation and degradation of phospholipid molecular species after cerebral ischemia. Using the four-vessel occlusion model of adult Wistar rats, we analyzed quantitatively the cerebral phospholipid molecular species of diacyl phosphatidylcholine and diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine and released free fatty acids during ischemia. Total diacyl phosphatidylcholine molecular species decreased gradually but did not show any significant difference even at 60 minutes. By contrast, total diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine abruptly decreased after 5 minutes and continued to decrease significantly thereafter. Polyunsaturated molecular species showed a higher ratio of degradation than saturated and monounsaturated molecular species of either phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine. Total free fatty acid accumulated according to the time elapsed, and statistical significance was obtained after 10 minutes. Free arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids were attributed to these significant accumulations at 10, 15, and 30 minutes. At 60 minutes, individual free fatty acids increased nonspecifically. Free fatty acids, which are hydrolyzed from phospholipid classes, are known to be further metabolized to bioactive substances such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Rapid degradation of phospholipid molecular species, especially of diacyl polyunsaturated molecular species, could be an important finding to membrane perturbation. Effective prevention of these changes might enhance tolerance to ischemic brain damage.\r"

  ".W": "The presence and distribution of a cerebrovascular cholinergic system were studied in goats. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in the parietal cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, and white matter by the hydrogen clearance technique in unanesthetized goats. Intravenous low doses of physostigmine, but not of neostigmine, significantly increased regional blood flow without changing mean arterial blood pressure or behavior. Increases of blood flow were greater in cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus than in white matter although the vasodilation induced by hypercapnia was similar in the three regions. Intracerebral microvessels were isolated from cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, and white matter to evaluate choline acetyltransferase activity as a marker for perivascular cholinergic nerves. The enzyme level was higher in vessels from cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus than in vessels from white matter, which is in accordance with the functional data. These results suggest the presence of a cholinergic perivascular innervation system in intracerebral microvessels. Such innervation has a nonhomogeneous distribution throughout the brain and might be implicated in the local regulation of cerebral blood flow.\r"

The resulting thrombosis was produced in the middle or rostral cerebral artery within 5-15 minutes after delivery of the thrombogenic device. The correlation of location of the coil in the intracranial vasculature of the internal carotid artery with the anatomic distribution of resulting cerebral infarcts suggests that this experimental model can produce a selective acute local occlusion of cerebral vessels in a high proportion of dogs without violating the cranium. The composition of the autologous thromboembolus, the low mortality rate, and the excellent reproducibility will make the correlative study of thrombolytic agents and their therapeutic efficacy possible.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of hypermagnesemia on spinal metabolic rate. The 2-[14C]deoxyglucose technique was used to measure regional glucose utilization in the lumbar spinal cord of paralyzed, mechanically ventilated rats receiving 70% nitrous oxide and an intravenous infusion of either saline (n = 5) or magnesium sulfate (n = 5). Plasma magnesium concentrations were 6.75 +/- 0.5 and 0.9 +/- 0.5 mM (p less than 0.01) in hypermagnesemic and control rats, respectively. Hypermagnesemic rats were hypotensive (88 +/- 1 vs. 130 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) but blood pressure remained within the autoregulatory range. Glucose utilization was reduced 26-45% in spinal gray matter and 53-63% in spinal white matter during hypermagnesemia. We conclude that magnesium is a potent spinal metabolic depressant and that this action, which is unusually prominent in spinal white matter, is a plausible explanation for the recently reported beneficial effect of magnesium therapy during spinal cord ischemia.\r"

Our technique was validated by measurements of local cerebral blood flow, tissue pH, and local cerebral glucose utilization in the brains of sham-operated rats. Sham-operated rats showed a 14% reduction in local cerebral blood flow and a 10% reduction in local cerebral glucose utilization in the most affected piriform and entorhinal cortical regions compared with the contralateral homologous regions.

More severe and extensive reduction of all three variables was observed in the hyperglycemic than in the normoglycemic rats. In seven normoglycemic rats, significant reduction in local cerebral blood flow (p less than 0.025) was observed in the ischemic but not in the contralateral nonischemic side at the lateral portion of the caudate nucleus and the neocortex. Tissue pH was significantly lower (p less than 0.025) only at the lateral portion of the caudate nucleus in the ischemic side. No significant differences in local cerebral glucose utilization were observed when the two hemispheres were compared. In the ischemic hemisphere of five hyperglycemic rats, the caudate nucleus and the neocortex exhibited significant reduction (p less than 0.025) in local cerebral blood flow, tissue pH, and local cerebral glucose utilization. Even in the nonischemic hemisphere of the hyperglycemic rats, local cerebral blood flow in the caudate nucleus and the neocortex was significantly reduced (p less than 0.025) compared with the normoglycemic rats. No significant change in tissue pH or local cerebral glucose utilization was observed throughout the nonischemic hemisphere of the hyperglycemic compared with the normoglycemic rats. Tissue pH was systematically lower in the hyperglycemic than in the normoglycemic rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Second primary malignancies developed in 5 of these patients within three months of the start of BCG therapy. All 5 showed acceleration of the second primary tumor, and distant metastatic lesions developed in 4. In the other 5 patients nonbladder primary malignancies developed eight months or more after intravesical BCG therapy started, but did not show acceleration or spread. Twenty patients with other primary malignancies that had developed months to years before intravesical therapy did not show acceleration or spread of those tumors. We have seen enough cases of patients who received intravesical BCG at the time of growth and spread of second primary malignancies to warrant concern. Animal and human studies of BCG use for treatment of malignancy indicate that the temporal relationship between the starting point of tumor development and the starting point of BCG treatment is crucial in determining whether BCG will eradicate or exacerbate the tumor. We have therefore instituted a change in our treatment until the question of whether or not BCG causes the appearance and spread of these second malignancies is answered.\r"

  ".W": "The Rigiscan machine was used to measure nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity in 41 men referred for evaluation of erectile impotence. In 6 patients, the Rigiscan was compared with the Tumistore and Snap-Gauge bands. Two patients achieved significant tumescence as measured by Tumistore, and 3 had significant tumescence as indicated by the breaking of two or three of the Snap-Gauge bands. None of these men achieved sufficient rigidity for intercourse as measured by the Rigiscan. Fourteen patients with organic impotence received intracorporeal injections of papaverine and were then monitored by Rigiscan. Six of the 14 were noted to have a Peyronie plaque. Of the remaining 8, 6 of these men achieved lasting erections sufficient for intercourse. The other 2 had erections that lasted ten minutes and were considered to have venous leak impotence. All patients with Peyronie disease had tumescence after papaverine injection, but in 5 the penis became rigid only at the base. Complications of papaverine injection were uncommon and minor. The Rigiscan and papaverine are useful in the diagnosis and management of erectile impotency.\r"

In order to gain a rough indication of the back pain among elderly women which might be due to osteoporosis, the prevalence was compared in the two sexes. The prevalence of back pain without radiation to the legs and concomitant morbidity was found to be similar among men and women up to the 70-79-year age-group. After this age the prevalence was higher in women. Those with exceptional loss of body height or kyphosis had a high prevalence of back pain, while those who had sustained previous hip or radius fractures did not. There was increasing prevalence of back pain among women with increasing number of previous fractures. The study gives little indication of serious morbidity of osteoporosis in the form of back pain before very old age.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of chronic iron deficiency anaemia on myoglobin content, maximal enzyme activities and capillarization in the human skeletal muscle was investigated. Muscle samples from musculus vastus lateralis were screened in an Indonesian population. The causes of iron deficiency were chronic intestinal bleeding or repeated pregnancy combined with low iron intake. The maximal activities of iron-dependent and non-iron-dependent glycolytic and oxidative enzymes as well as myoglobin showed similar values in the iron-deficient group and the matched control group. The activities of the oxidative enzymes in both the iron-deficient group and the controls were lower, however, compared even to untrained Swedish subjects. The capillary density was essentially within a normal range in both groups. It is concluded that chronic iron deficiency anaemia of a moderate or severe degree, with Hb concentrations of about 80-100 g.1(-1), does not cause an impaired biochemical function of the human skeletal muscle.\r"

Urine was collected overnight from 22.00 to 08.00 hours and analysed for creatinine. Serum was sampled in the morning and analysed for creatinine, beta 2-microglobulin, progesterone and estradiol. The general trend of creatinine clearance was parabolic with a declining level during the last month before term. A sinusoid pattern with minimum values around the time when the women would have had menstruation had they not become pregnant was superimposed on the parabolic trend. A mathematical model (parabolas overlaid with a cosine curve) was constructed and fitted to the data. The cyclical pattern was significant. Serum creatinine showed a pattern with increasing values during the last 4-6 weeks before term and cyclical changes which were also significant. In the individual case the monthly and preterm clearance decrement sometimes was over 50%. Monthly and preterm decreases in creatinine clearance may be quite normal and serial measurements of creatinine clearance are therefore necessary to determine if declining values indicate pathological falls in the glomerular filtration rate.\r"

  ".W": "In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, 16 patients undergoing successful coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within 6 hours of presentation (group I) and eight patients receiving conventional medical therapy (group II) were studied by serial two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography to assess the functional recovery of myocardium. All patients underwent 2D echocardiograms within 24 hours of presentation and at a minimum of 6 days after admission. Wall motion analysis was quantified with a wall motion score index based on 16 left ventricular wall segments. Wall motion score index improved significantly from early to late echocardiographic study in the patients undergoing PTCA (1.65 +/- 0.29 to 1.40 +/- 0.30; p less than 0.001), whereas the index did not improve in the conventionally treated group (1.54 +/- 0.26 to 1.58 +/- 0.25; p = NS). One patient in group II had a greater than or equal to 10% improvement in wall motion score index compared to 11 of 16 in group I (p less than 0.01). In all cases improvement in wall motion score index was due to improvement in regional wall motion in the area of infarction. In group I, 40 of 77 (52%) infarct zone segments showed improvement of at least one grade, versus 4 of 28 (14%) segments in group II (p less than 0.001). These data indicate that regional myocardial function improves in the majority of patients undergoing successful PTCA as emergency therapy for acute myocardial infarction and that serial 2D echocardiography is an excellent means to quantify this improvement.\r"

  ".W": "The cardioprotective efficacy of coronary perfusion during angioplasty was evaluated. Forty-two patients underwent transcatheter infusion of oxygenated Fluosol DA, 20% emulsion (FDA-20), a perfluorocarbon oxygen transport fluid, into the distal coronary artery during balloon inflations. Left ventricular function was continuously monitored by two-dimensional echocardiography, and left ventricular ejection fraction was quantitatively analyzed from the video record by an area-length method with a validated computer algorithm. Each patient had multiple nonperfused and perfused balloon inflations lasting more than 45 seconds. Nineteen of the 42 patients also received control solutions of oxygenated Ringer's lactate and nonoxygenated FDA-20. The ejection fraction of nonperfused sequences fell from a baseline value of 57 +/- 15% to 36 +/- 14% at 45 seconds of inflation time (p less than 0.0005). Falls of similar magnitude were seen in the lactated Ringer's and nonoxygenated FDA-20 perfused balloon inflations. The ejection fraction fall was associated with a 54% rise in end-systolic volume (p less than 0.0005) and a 4% rise in end-diastolic volume (p = ns) compared to baseline. Inflations perfused with oxygenated FDA-20 showed a 45-second, left ventricular ejection fraction of 53 +/- 13% (p = ns compared to baseline), which was significantly greater (p less than 0.0001) than the 45-second ejection fraction of the nonperfused, or control solution perfused sequences. Results indicate that the profound fall in ejection fraction occurring during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can be ameliorated by distal coronary perfusion with an oxygenated perfluorocarbon emulsion.\r"

After pretreatment, nine digoxin-pretreated dogs and nine control dogs were anesthetized and subjected to a 60-minute occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. Anatomic myocardial infarct size, expressed as a percentage of the areas at risk of infarction and as a percentage of the total left ventricle were: 20.2 +/- 3.3% control vs 35.4 +/- 6.2% digoxin-pretreated (p less than 0.05) and 8.6 +/- 1.3% control vs 14.7 +/- 2.5% digoxin-pretreated (p less than 0.05), respectively (2.04 +/- 0.37 ng/ml serum digoxin). Regional myocardial blood flow in the nonischemic and ischemic zones tended to be lower in digoxin-pretreated than in control animals at baseline testing and were significantly reduced in the anterior subendocardial sites of digoxin-pretreated dogs during ischemia and reperfusion. These data suggest that an exacerbation or enhancement of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury may occur in the presence of clinically observable serum digoxin concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Whether catheterization of the right heart should be performed routinely in all patients undergoing coronary angiography for assessment of coronary artery disease is controversial. To objectively assess the utility of routine right heart catheterization, hemodynamic data from 2,178 patients studied for angina having no signs, symptoms, or history of congestive heart failure were analyzed retrospectively. The salient results are as follows: 0.9% patients had unsuspected mitral valve gradients greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg; 0.4% had occult left-to-right shunts; 1% had pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg) not attributable to an elevated mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP); 4.8% had PCWP greater than or equal to 18 mm Hg; 6% had cardiac indexes less than or equal to 2.0 L/min/m2, suggesting subclinical left ventricular failure. Overall, 14.5% of patients had at least one abnormal right-sided hemodynamic variable revealed by right heart catheterization. The frequency of abnormalities increased with increasing Canadian Cardiovascular Society grade of angina. Ten percent of grade 1, 14% of grade 2, 15% of grade 3, and 19% of patient 4 patients had at least one abnormality (phi 2 test, p less than or equal to 0.005). It is concluded that the right heart catheterization adds an important dimension to the diagnosis and treatment of patients undergoing coronary angiography for assessment of coronary artery disease and might significantly influence subsequent patient management.\r"

  ".W": "Severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and frequent ventricular premature beats (VPBs) on ambulatory ECG monitoring in the late hospital phase after myocardial infarction are independent predictors of prognosis. To study the relationship between extent of CAD and VPB frequency, 128 consecutive (91 men, 37 women) patients surviving 6 days after myocardial infarction underwent 24-hour ECG, coronary angiography, and left ventriculography. CAD was graded as zero to one-, two-, and three-vessel (V), and also by a previously validated \"jeopardy score\" with 0 to 12 as grades of incremental CAD severity. Average VPB frequency was significantly correlated with CAD by V, CAD by jeopardy score, and by left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.01 for all three). With the use of a multivariate ordinal logistic regression model, both VPB frequency and left ventricular ejection fraction were found to have independent association with CAD. The median VPB frequency was 1/hr, 0.6/hr, and 6/hr in zero to one-, two-, and three-V CAD, respectively (zero to one- and two-V CAD vs three-V CAD p less than 0.01, one-V CAD vs two-V CAD p = NS). In conclusion, frequent VPBs following myocardial infarction are associated with extensive CAD and are independent of left ventricular ejection fraction. Therefore, the prognostic value of frequent VPBs may be related to severe underlying ischemic disease.\r"

Daily recordings were taken for the first 7 days of loading and on the ninth, twelfth, fourteenth, and twenty-first day of maintenance therapy. All patients had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), 10 of them had late potential (LP) positive recording, and four were LP negative during control measurements. Amiodarone loading significantly changed all SAECG indices and prolonged the QTc. Changes induced by amiodarone were present within 24 hours of administration. The time to reach peak effect varied from 6 to 9 days. The maximum increase in late potential duration (LPD) was threefold greater than the increase in filtered QRS duration or QTc (61% vs 18% vs 14%, respectively), suggesting a more pronounced effect on the reentrant pathway than on the remaining myocardium. Of the four LP negative patients, three became LP positive while receiving amiodarone. In conclusion, amiodarone affects all SAECG indices. However, the magnitude of the changes varies, being most pronounced on the LPD. Amiodarone affects the SAECG and the QTc within the first 24 hours. The time of onset of the peak effect varies from 6 to 9 days. LP negative patients with inducible VT frequently became LP positive during amiodarone therapy.\r"

All patients had at least 75% suppression of VPDs. The mean duration of therapy before the onset of antiarrhythmic effect was 13.2 days (range 1 to 36 days). Trough amiodarone and desethylamiodarone plasma concentrations at the time of onset of antiarrhythmic effect were 0.86 +/- 0.48 mg/L and 0.23 +/- 0.15 mg/L, respectively. Sixty-seven percent of patients responded at amiodarone concentrations below 1.0 mg/L. For each patient there was a progressive decrease in frequency of VPDs as both amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations increased. Regression modeling indicated that both amiodarone and desethylamiodarone plasma concentrations explained significant variability in the frequency of VPDs, and amiodarone and desethylamiodarone plasma concentrations were highly correlated with each other. There was a trend for desethylamiodarone to explain more variability in frequency of VPDs than amiodarone.\r"
