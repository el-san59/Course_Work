  ".W": "In the present study, rats were depleted of vitamin B-12 with fiber-free or 5% pectin diets, with or without neomycin. Through use of this intestinal antibiotic reported to \"spare\" vitamin B-12, we sought to determine if bacterial fermentation of pectin might explain our previous observations of negative effects of pectin on vitamin B-12 status. However, neomycin did not lessen interference by pectin with vitamin B-12 metabolism. Pectin increased urinary methylmalonate and decreased propionate oxidation to a greater extent in the presence than in the absence of neomycin. Also, regardless of the presence of neomycin, the biologic half-life of injected [57Co]vitamin B-12 was 58 d for rats fed the fiber-free diets and only 38 d for rats fed 5% pectin diets. Neomycin delayed early fecal excretion of 57Co but had no persistent effect. Thus, neomycin-sensitive bacteria do not mediate the negative effects of pectin on vitamin B-12 status. Pectin may interfere directly with vitamin B-12 absorption or may stimulate vitamin B-12 uptake or propionate production by microbial species that have adapted to neomycin.\r"

Within 30 s following thrombin activation, the amount of polymerized actin in Triton X-100 extracts of whole platelets from copper-deficient rats was greater than the amount in platelets from copper-adequate rats. Electrophoretic analysis of the cytoskeletal proteins obtained from low speed centrifugation of the Triton X-100 extracts indicated that the myosin content of the cytoskeleton increased with time and reached higher levels following activation in platelets from copper-deficient rats. Actin content of the cytoskeleton also increased with time following activation. However, the difference in cytoskeletal actin content of platelets from copper-deficient and copper-adequate rats was not as great as that observed for myosin. The rate of ATP secretion from thrombin-activated platelets was also increased by copper deficiency. Myosin association with the platelet cytoskeleton may be involved in platelet secretion following thrombin activation. Thus, the increased association of myosin with the cytoskeleton and concomitant increase in ATP secretion suggest that the normal mechanism for stimulus-response coupling is altered in thrombin-activated platelets from copper-deficient rats.\r"

Fasted adult male rats weighing approximately 350 g were given 50 micrograms of fluoride in 1 ml of water by stomach intubation, with 14C-labeled polyethylene glycol as a marker of water movement through the gastrointestinal tract. Rats were killed at intervals up to 120 min, and the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, distal ileum and cecum were rapidly clamped and removed for fluoride analysis and 14C counting. Approximately 90% of the fluoride dose was absorbed in 120 min. Peak plasma fluoride concentration occurred 10 min after intubation and began to decline after 40 min as the rate of fluoride absorption slowed. Absorption from the stomach was derived from rates of gastric emptying and remaining fluoride. Even at 10 min after intubation, when the bulk of the fluoride remained in the stomach, only approximately 25% of fluoride absorption had occurred from the stomach and 75% from the small intestine. After 120 min, 19.8% of total fluoride absorption had occurred from the stomach. Although the stomach is unquestionably a significant site for fluoride absorption, its contribution is much smaller than that of the small intestine.\r"

  ".W": "The question was addressed whether dietary phosphorus-induced nephrocalcinosis in rats is associated with impaired kidney function. Weanling female rats were fed purified diets containing either 0.4 or 0.6% (wt/wt) phosphorus for 28 d. The diet containing 0.6% phosphorus produced marked kidney calcification, as determined both by chemical analysis of kidney calcium and histological examination in kidney sections. Histological examination did not show calcification in stomach, lung, heart or thoracic aorta, which are predisposition sites of metastatic calcification in secondary renal hyperparathyroidism. In rats fed the 0.6% phosphorus diet, phosphorus retention and urinary excretion were greater compared with rats fed the 0.4% phosphorus diet. The following indicators of kidney function were examined: water intake, urinary volume, urine and plasma osmolality, urine and plasma creatinine, urine and plasma urea, urea and creatinine clearance and urinary albumin excretion. Of these indicators, only urinary albumin excretion was significantly increased in rats fed the nephrocalcinogenic diet. In a further experiment, the increase of urinary albumin was reproduced. After pooling the results of the two experiments, in individual rats fed the 0.6% phosphorus diet, the concentration of kidney calcium was found to be positively related with kidney weight expressed relative to body weight (r = 0.82, n = 22) and with albumin excretion in urine (r = 0.79, n = 28). The increased weight of calcinotic kidneys was mainly due to both calcium deposition and tubular hyperplasia. It is concluded that dietary phosphorus-induced nephrocalcinosis is associated with impaired kidney function in rats.\r"

Extraliposomal picolinic acid increased the efflux of Zn, Cu, Co, Mn, Ni, Cd, Pb, Fe(II) and Ca from the vesicles. However, when picolinic acid was trapped with Co, Cu and Zn within the liposomes, the loss of metals was reduced. In a partition study, picolinic acid increased the aqueous solubility of Zn, Cu, Co and Cd at alkaline pH, but did not transfer the metal to an organic bulk phase of chloroform. It is proposed that picolinic acid does not act as an ionophore and that any effect it may have on zinc metabolism is dependent upon its unselective chelating properties, which may also lead to altered dietary and systemic compartmentation of other divalent cations.\r"

The value obtained for absorption with this method is influenced by excretion of absorbed tracer into feces during the fecal collection period and by any incomplete elimination of unabsorbed tracer. In the present study a published, physiologically based compartmental model of zinc metabolism has been used to calculate, after oral tracer administration, the fecal appearance of unabsorbed and absorbed tracer and the appearance when fractional rates of endogenous excretion and elimination were varied. Absorption was determined by fecal monitoring and compared to the value determined using parameter values of the compartmental model. The value calculated for absorption using fecal monitoring varied with length of fecal collection, rate of excretion of absorbed tracer (secretion) and rate of elimination of unabsorbed tracer. Absorption was determined correctly by fecal monitoring only when the amount of absorbed tracer excreted was equivalent to the amount of unabsorbed tracer remaining in the gut. Fecal monitoring determines a parameter representing the combined processes of absorption, endogenous excretion (or secretion) and fecal elimination.\r"

Three groups of kittens were adapted to purified diets containing 43.5% soy protein that were either taurine-free (OT) or contained 0.15% taurine (NT) or 1.0% taurine (HT). The plasma taurine concentration of the kittens fed OT decreased from 104 +/- 25 microM to 16 +/- 5 microM and 1.7 +/- 0.5 microM in 1 and 6 wk, respectively. Feeding HT increased plasma taurine concentration to 350 +/- 116 microM in 1 wk. Compared to NT, taurine accumulation by BBM vesicles was significantly elevated after 4 wk of feeding OT and decreased after 2 wk or less of feeding HT (P less than 0.05). Maximum renal adaptation occurred by 6 wk of feeding OT (206% increase in taurine uptake/15 s compared to NT) and by 2 wk or less of feeding HT (43% decrease in taurine uptake/15 s compared to NT). Evaluation of transport kinetics using renal cortex from groups of four kittens (16 determinations) fed NT, OT (12 wk) or HT (10 wk) revealed a Vmax of 55 +/- 10, 123 +/- 24 or 39 +/- 7 pmol.mg protein-1.10 s-1 and a Km of 32 +/- 7, 16 +/- 2 or 37 +/- 8 microM, respectively. The differences in Vmax and Km were significant between NT and OT (P less than 0.05), but not significant between NT and HT (P greater than 0.05). Our results suggest that renal adaptation of the kitten to changes in dietary taurine occurs with modifications of both Vmax and Km of the taurine transport system.\r"

To test this idea, 54Mn was administered orally or intravenously to rats, and blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture at various time points postdosing. Plasma proteins were separated using fast protein liquid chromatography with a combination of anion exchange and gel filtration columns. Using these methods, independent of the route of 54Mn administration, transferrin was identified as the major Mn-binding protein in plasma. The identity was further confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. These results conclusively show that 54Mn in plasma is carried by transferrin, regardless of route of administration and time postdosing.\r"

Rats were fed the diet for 3 mo, and then resting metabolic rate, body composition and adipose tissue cellularity were evaluated. Although body mass was greater in rats fed the HF diet, this difference was due to a rapid increase in mass within the first 2 wk. There was no difference in the rate of body mass gain after this period. Resting mass-independent metabolic rate did not significantly differ due to age, diet or gender. In general, percentage fat mass was greater in rats fed the HF diet and in female than in male rats in both diet groups. However, lean body mass (%) was not altered due to diet or age. Cell number of the retroperitoneal depot increased with age and diet between 5 and 23 mo of age in both male and female rats. There was no effect of age, diet or gender on retroperitoneal cell size or gonadal cell number and size. These data suggest that age, gender and diet do not significantly alter the ability of F344 rats to regulate body composition or fat cell proliferation.\r"

In rats fed the MCD diet plus a methionine (Met) supplement (MCD + Met), hepatic SAM levels and the SAM:SAH ratio were higher and lipid levels lower than in MCD-fed rats, indicating that the MCD diet is marginally deficient in methyl donor groups. The injection of nicotinamide or the removal of folate from the MCD diet increased the severity of methyl donor deficiency, as shown by lower hepatic SAM levels and higher hepatic lipid levels.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed nutritionally sufficient liquid diets for 12 wk with or without ethanol, folate and sulfonamide. Urinary folate excretion was increased in ethanol-fed rats consuming folate-containing diets, but not in rats fed folate deficient diets. Consumption of folate-deficient diets led to a rapid decrease in urinary folate excretion, suggesting renal adaptation to conserve folate. Tissue and plasma levels of folate were mostly unaffected by ethanol ingestion in rats fed folate-containing diets. Ethanol treatment did not consistently enhance tissue folate depletion in rats fed folate-deficient diets. The results suggest that in rats consuming diets containing high levels of folate, chronic ethanol ingestion increased urinary folate excretion, but not to a sufficient magnitude to consistently affect folate homeostasis.\r"

Previous studies have shown that urinary excretion of total [3H]-label after administration of [3H]folic acid is slightly higher in ethanol-treated rats because of conversion of the tracer to forms whose excretion is not affected by ethanol. Since [3H]folic acid is not the physiological substrate for the kidney, studies were performed using a high specific activity 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid ([3H]5-CH3-H4 folic acid). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given four consecutive hourly doses of ethanol at 1 g/kg, followed by infusion of [3H]5-CH3-H4 folic acid at 5 h. Urine samples were collected to 6 h, when rats were killed, and plasma, liver and kidney samples were collected. Endogenous urinary folate excretion and the fractional urinary excretion of both endogenous and [3H]5-CH3-H4 folic acid at the 5-6 h time period were significantly higher in ethanol-treated rats. The kidney had a tenfold greater specific incorporation of [3H]-label than did the liver. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the plasma obtained at 6 h showed that 68% of the label was [3H]5-CH3-H4 folic acid, and HPLC analysis of the urine obtained from 5-6 h showed that only 10% of the label was [3H]5-CH3-H4 folic acid. The data indicate that [3H]5-CH3-H4 folic acid was rapidly taken up by the kidney and metabolized to other folate and nonfolate forms, which were then secreted into the renal tubule for excretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three groups of 15 New Zealand rabbits were fed standard or cholesterol-rich diets either ad libitum or in restricted amounts and in vitro binding assays on hepatocyte membranes were carried out after 4, 8, 12 and 20 d. Cholesterol feeding reduced the specific binding of labeled beta-VLDL to liver membranes. Dietary restriction, which enhances the hypercholesterolemia induced by cholesterol feeding, had no additional effect on the down-regulation of beta-VLDL specific binding. In another set of experiments the uptake of labeled beta-VLDL by various tissues was measured after 15 d of feeding the diets. Cholesterol feeding decreased uptake of these lipoproteins by the liver and various extrahepatic tissues, such as skin, intestine, muscle, adipose tissue, kidneys, spleen and aorta. Additional changes occurred in liver and intestine with dietary restriction. In liver beta-VLDL uptake in the group fed a restricted amount of the cholesterol-containing diet was 70% of that in the group fed the same diet ad libitum. Taken together, the results suggest that dietary restriction acts mainly on the receptor-independent catabolism of beta-VLDL.\r"

The high doses of Phe given by the i.g. or s.c. route resulted in higher levels of Phe in both plasma and brain than those following i.p. injection (90 mg/kg body wt). Furthermore, brain Tyr levels after i.g. Phe (720 mg/kg body wt) were equal to or higher than after i.p. Phe (90 mg/kg body wt). We conclude that the route of administration is an important variable influencing the effects of Phe on feeding behavior, and that these effects are not readily explained by plasma or brain Phe and Tyr concentrations.\r"

The subjects read clinical and laboratory data for six pairs of cases of anemia, reviewing the blood smear for one case in each pair. They correctly identified the presence or absence of morphologic features on the blood smears 82% of the time. In spite of excellent morphologic discrimination, the number of tests ordered was not affected by blood smear review. In fact, the quality of the physicians' workup plans, measured by numbers of tests appropriately ordered and excluded, was slightly but significantly better when they did not review the smears (p less than 0.005). In addition, smear review did not significantly improve diagnostic accuracy for any of the common anemias studied. Significantly more correct diagnoses were made without smear review for vitamin B12-folate deficiency anemia (p less than 0.015) and thalassemia (p less than 0.0001). Although routine review of blood smears by physicians in the management of common anemias may provide useful information, the authors were unable to demonstrate an improvement in the number or appropriateness of tests ordered or diagnostic accuracy in spite of excellent morphologic discrimination.\r"

Using a score of 0 as a cutoff point, the scoring system selected patients with hypothyroidism from the referral center for further biochemical evaluation; at the same time, it excluded hypothyroidism with confidence in 42% of euthyroid subjects. In the peripheral hospital, a cutoff score of -10 selected 92% of hypothyroid subjects for further evaluation and excluded hypothyroidism in 55% of euthyroid subjects. Two cutoff points were needed because the prevalences of hypothyroidism in the two centers differed. The simple scoring system increased the pretest probability of disease by 15% in the peripheral hospital and by 19% in the referral clinic. In countries where resources are limited, this scoring system can improve the clinical evaluation of patients who have one or more symptoms of hypothyroidism and reduce the load on referral centers.\r"

The results of the initial prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time tests were divided into three groups: normal; abnormal above the hospital laboratory's upper limit of normal but below an \"action limit\"; and abnormal above an action limit. Patients with abnormal preoperative coagulation screening test results were matched on the basis of operative procedure and age with patients who had normal results. The matched groups of patients were compared according to preoperative length of stay and the cost of subsequent related preoperative testing. The average cost of follow-up preoperative testing for patients with abnormal screening test results was $5.05, compared with $0.58 for patients with normal screening results. The difference in average preoperative lengths of stay was not statistically significant. The attributable cost of evaluating an abnormal result added 3% to the cost of the initial coagulation screening program. This represents an average preoperative cost of $0.36 per patient in addition to the cost of the screening tests themselves.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among patients' perceptions about the roles they played during medical visits, their subsequent attitudes about their illnesses and treatments, and their self-rated improvement. DESIGN: Questionnaires were completed by patients before, one day after, and one week after their medical visits, and by their physicians following the visits. SETTING: The study was conducted in a general internal medicine faculty practice that provided adult primary care to a largely HMO population. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with new or increased symptoms who were capable of reading and understanding the study questionnaire. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (47%) reported playing an active role; 62 patients (53%) reported playing a passive role. After adjusting for age, sex, baseline illness ratings, and physician-rated prognosis, \"active\" patients reported less discomfort (p = 0.04), greater alleviation of symptoms (p = 0.008), and more improvement in their general medical condition (p = 0.04) one week after the visits than did \"passive\" patients. These differences were not influenced by the roles patients desired to play. Active patients also reported less concern with their illnesses (p = 0.04), a greater sense of control of their illnesses (p = 0.04), and more satisfaction with their physicians (p = 0.02) one day after the visit. Post-visit dysfunction ratings were not related to patients' role perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' perceptions about their involvement in care appeared to be related to their attitudes about their illnesses as well as to recovery. Further research is needed, however, to determine the factors that influence these role perceptions and to define the types of patients, illnesses, and settings in which the benefits of active-role perceptions are most likely to be realized.\r"

PATIENT POPULATION: Fifty-five unselected patients with iron-deficiency anemia due to gastrointestinal blood loss evaluated by a gastroenterology referral service at a city hospital. RESULTS: The patients' mean hematocrit was 26 +/- 15% (SD). Thirty two (58%) had pica, and in 28 (88%) it manifested as pagophagia. Pica was present significantly more often in women (19/32, 68%) than in men (9/23, 39%, p less than 0.05). Pica occurred less frequently in patients with malignancy (2/9 vs. 30/46), but this difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: Pica, a frequent symptom in patients with iron-deficiency anemia due to gastrointestinal blood loss, particularly women, is not of value in predicting the cause of bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Methods of assessing humanism in internal medicine residents have not been completely designed or evaluated. This study used patient satisfaction as a measure of humanism, and assessed the validity of using faculty physicians to evaluate residents' humanistic behavior. Residents' ability to assess themselves was also evaluated. SETTING: A university-affiliated internal medicine training program. SUBJECTS: Forty-seven internal medicine residents were evaluated by patients, faculty, and themselves. DESIGN: Faculty physicians were given standard faculty evaluation and patient satisfaction forms, and were asked to evaluate residents. These evaluations were compared with the patients' responses on the same satisfaction forms. Residents performed self-assessment using identical forms; these responses were compared with those of the faculty and patients. RESULTS: There was no correlation between patients' responses and those of the faculty or residents. There was a significant inverse correlation between resident and faculty responses, especially for the female residents (r = 0.71). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the need for further study of the evaluation process, including what factors influence individuals to respond as they do. It appears that the use of one rating group is not sufficient to achieve an accurate assessment of residents' humanistic skills. The present status of the process of evaluating humanism is discussed.\r"

The lesion was typical in that it was pulsatile, had a systolic bruit, and had a filling defect that was evident on carotid angiography. Although a traumatic aneurysm is a rare occurrence in the facial region, the inclusion of this lesion in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue lesions is important if the serious consequences of hemorrhage are to be avoided.\r"

Responders were identified by their consistent improvement from baseline on standard teacher rating scales. The therapeutically effective drug doses were corrected for body size and evaluated in relation to increasing age and treatment duration. Body size corrections included milligrams per kilogram, milligrams per kilogram to the 0.7th power, and milligrams per square meter of estimated body surface area. The major findings were that (1) the dose of methylphenidate, when adjusted for growth, did not change significantly during the 3 to 10 years of treatment; (2) the loss of a previously satisfactory response to methylphenidate treatment was uncommon (6%) and when present was related to middle school enrollment, male gender, noncompliance with medication, and lower than customary dosage; (3) the dose calculations that minimized the effects of growth with age were milligrams per kilogram to the 0.7th power and milligrams per square meter of estimated body surface area; and (4) the commonly used milligrams per kilogram dose consistently overcorrected for growth with advancing age.\r"

Women in labor at less than or equal to 34 weeks of gestation were randomly selected to receive antenatal vitamin K1, 5 mg given intramuscularly (vitamin K1 group), or no vitamin K1 (control group). Eight infants, including one set of twins, were in the vitamin K1 group and six in the control group. Vitamin K1 concentrations were higher in the vitamin K1 group than in the control group (p = 0.06). Activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged, and factor II coagulation activity and factor II antigen were proportionately decreased in cord plasma in both groups. The average ratio of factor II coagulation activity to antigen was not decreased in either group. Protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) was not detectable in any cord plasma sample in either group. These findings support previous reports that the decreased vitamin K-dependent coagulation activity in premature infants is the result of reduced synthesis of precursor proteins, rather than the result of vitamin K deficiency, and suggest that additional vitamin K1 is not likely to improve coagulation activity. Among those infants who underwent cranial ultrasonography, all four in the vitamin K1 group and one of five in the control group had mild intraventricular hemorrhage. Studies of a larger number of patients are necessary before it can be established that maternal antenatal administration of vitamin K1 results in improvement of coagulation and the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants.\r"

All were managed in a well-staffed medical ward or, when necessary, in the pediatric intensive care unit. Supportive measures included reverse barrier isolation, intravenous fluids and nutritional support, meticulous skin care, early detection and treatment of infection, and daily ophthalmologic examination. No patient was treated with systemic steroids. The mortality rate was zero. Eye complications, consisting of dry eyes or mild chronic symblepharon, were the most significant long-term sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "A case-control study of 34 children with occult bacteremia was conducted to test the hypothesis that nonresponse to acetaminophen (decrease less than or equal to 0.8 degrees C) is a risk factor for occult bacteremia. Febrile children visiting the emergency center from May 1986 to October 1987 were monitored for occult bacteremia. Inclusion criteria were age 2 months to 6 years, temperature greater than or equal to 38.9 degrees C, and having a blood culture. Exclusion criteria were serious acute or chronic illness, sponging for fever reduction, current therapy with antibiotics or steroids, and admission to the hospital. Records of 3892 febrile children were reviewed. Of these, 2101 (54%) had a blood culture and 1028 (26%) were eligible. All patients (positive blood culture) were matched with two control subjects (negative blood culture). Patients and control subjects had similar age, gender, ethnicity, height of initial temperature, time to second temperature, and dose of acetaminophen. The estimated risk of occult bacteremia for nonresponders was 9.2 (95% confidence interval 2.7, 32.0). We conclude that children who do not respond to acetaminophen by at least a 0.8 degrees C decrease in temperature have an increased risk of occult bacteremia. However, achieving a response to acetaminophen does not eliminate the possibility that the child has occult bacteremia.\r"

Seventeen patients also performed pulmonary function testing. The mean patient age was 10.3 +/- 4.4 (SD) years, and mean percent of ideal body weight was 208 +/- 42.2. A sleep history questionnaire showed that all patients snored, but frank apnea was reported in only 32%. The pulmonary function tests showed 18% (3/17) with a restrictive defect and 47% (8/17) with obstructive changes. The polysomnograms in 37% (15/41) of the patients were abnormal because of apnea, hypopnea, excessive arousals, or abnormalities in gas exchange. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated no significant association between weight, age, or gender and any physiologic measure on the polysomnogram. Most of the abnormal polysomnograms (13/15) were mildly abnormal, but two showed sufficiently severe abnormalities to require clinical intervention. We conclude that children and adolescents with morbid obesity are at risk for sleep-associated breathing disorders; their polysomnographic abnormalities are usually mild but rarely may be severe enough to require clinical intervention.\r"

Pulmonary function and ventilatory muscle strength did not differ between patients with myelomeningocele and control subjects. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses were significantly lower in the group with myelomeningocele (1.98 L/min/mm Hg) compared with control values (3.33 L/min/mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Hypoxic ventilatory responses (-1.4 L/min/%oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood) were not significantly different from control values (-2.14 L/min/%oxygen saturation). In control subjects the hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses were highly correlated with each other within subjects (r = 0.84; p less than 0.002) but not in those with myelomeningocele (r = 0.34; not significant). We concluded that adolescents and young adults with myelomeningocele have abnormalities in control of ventilation during sleep and wakefulness. We speculate that the Arnold-Chiari malformation interferes with central chemosensitivity (hypercapnic ventilatory response) and central integration of chemoreceptor output.\r"

This amniotic fluid cellular content provokes a foreign body inflammatory reaction that can persist for months. To evaluate whether clinical and postmortem findings might correlate with the amount of amniotic fluid cellular content in the middle ear, we compared temporal bones of nine patients born through meconium-contaminated amniotic fluid with those of 10 patients born through clear amniotic fluid. All patients were examined at less than 17 days postpartum and provided 37 temporal bones for histologic analysis. The volume of contaminant was quantified for each patient. The cases were arranged according to volume of contaminant in the middle ear and compared with clinical information and autopsy findings. Patients with larger volumes of contaminant in the middle ear were born through thick, meconium-stained amniotic fluid (1.9-38 mm3; average 9.3 mm3). Conversely, patients with lesser volumes of contaminant in the middle ear were born through unstained amniotic fluid (none to 3.2 mm3; average 0.9 mm3). We speculate that patients born through thick, meconium-stained amniotic fluid may be at greater risk of sequelae such as otitis media from this foreign body inflammatory reaction in the middle ear and mastoid cavity.\r"

Uric acid excretion (measured per deciliter glomerular filtration rate), and fractional excretion of uric acid were similar in 27 children with hypercalciuria and calcium oxalate urinary stones, in six children with idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis, and in five with uric acid urolithiasis, of whom four were white boys and one was an Asian girl. One boy with a urate stone had cystinosis. Serum uric acid concentrations exceeded 6.0 mg/dl (360 mumol/L) in two children with hypercalciuria and in two patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis. None of the children with calcium urolithiasis had excessive urinary excretion of uric acid. In children with hypercalciuria, uric acid excretion did not change significantly when dietary sodium was increased from 1.0 to 5.0 gm/1.73 m2. We conclude that excessive urinary uric acid excretion is seldom an additional risk factor in children with calcium urolithiasis and that dietary sodium chloride does not have a strong influence on urinary excretion of uric acid in children with hypercalciuria.\r"

Information about these factors were obtained systematically from parents, teachers, and physicians when the children were 7 and 11 years of age. The results were related to traffic injuries occurring for the first time during each subsequent 4-year period. Between 8 and 11 years of age, 431 children had a traffic injury requiring medical attention, and between 12 and 16 years the number was 590. Logistic regression analyses identified a small number of factors associated with injuries, which varied according to the age and gender of the child. When all these factors were entered into a final model, only five remained: fidgety, abnormal behavior, and three measures of family disruption or disadvantage--crowding, family problems, and being removed from the family and placed in the care of the local authority. These findings suggest that it may be unwise to place much reliance on \"high risk\" preventive strategies by measures of this kind. Instead, more emphasis should be placed on community-based passive and environmental strategies.\r"

In patients studied during the acute febrile phase of their disease, there was increased spontaneous TNF production (mean 26.9 +/- 40.3 U/ml) compared with that of control subjects (1.0 +/- .86 U/ml) (p less than or equal to 0.025). Spontaneous TNF production by patients tested in the subacute or convalescent phase of the illness was significantly lower than that in patients tested during the acute illness (p less than or equal to 0.025). In all patients studied with serial acute and subacute-convalescent samples, TNF production was normal in the follow-up samples. Because TNF is a potent mediator of inflammation and causes damage to vascular endothelial cells, we suggest that TNF may be important in the pathogenesis of both the immune activation and endothelial cell damage characteristic of this illness.\r"

Although both HIV-1-infected patient populations studied (pediatric hemophilia patients and other pediatric patients) had decreases in the values determined by their functional and phenotypic assays, no association between the functional and phenotypic assays was demonstrated. Thus some HIV-1-infected patients with a normal phenotype had no antigen-specific function, whereas other patients with a markedly abnormal T lymphocyte phenotype had normal antigen specific T lymphocyte function. These results indicate that the assessment of HIV-1-infected patients should include assays of antigen-specific immune function in addition to assays of T lymphocyte phenotype.\r"

Erythrocyte T antigens are activated by enzymes produced by clostridia or other bacteria in infants with sepsis, often in association with necrotizing enterocolitis. Transfusion of these infants with blood products containing plasma carries the risk of causing intravascular hemolysis. Our transfusion protocol included testing for T-antigen activation, restricting transfusion of patients with activated T antigens to washed erythrocytes or washed platelets whenever possible, and selecting donors with low-titer anti-T when plasma-containing blood products were required. In this series, 10 patients had T-antigen activation, including four with clostridial infections. Severe hemolysis occurred in one patient who received plasma before T-antigen activation developed. Of five patients who received low-titer anti-T plasma, mild hemolysis occurred in three and no hemolysis in two. Four patients who received no plasma-containing blood products experienced no hemolysis. Used cautiously, this protocol allows a full range of transfusion therapy to infants with T-antigen activation.\r"

One third of the patients with Marfan syndrome underwent repair of the pectus excavatum before diagnosis. Of the 30 patients with \"isolated\" pectus excavatum, 17 had findings by history or physical examination, such as mitral valve prolapse, scoliosis, or a relative with pectus excavatum, suggestive of an underlying disorder of connective tissue. Pectus excavatum of more than moderate severity recurred in 11 of 28 patients with Marfan syndrome and was associated with young age at initial surgery and lack of temporary internal stabilization of the chest after surgery. Only two of the control patients had recurrence of the defect; one of these patients had findings suggestive of an underlying heritable disorder of connective tissue. We conclude that pectus excavatum may indicate the presence of an underlying heritable disorder of connective tissue such as the Marfan syndrome. In patients with Marfan syndrome, and possibly other inherited connective tissue disorders, surgical repair should be delayed if possible until skeletal maturity is nearly complete and should employ internal stabilization.\r"

DESIGN: Weekly or biweekly measures of growth were made longitudinally on a cohort of infants from birth to 36 weeks of age, and monthly measures of nutrient intake were made from 16 weeks of age until 10 weeks after solid foods were introduced into the diet. SUBJECTS: Volunteer mother-infant pairs from middle and upper income groups who met entry criteria, including the intention to breast-feed exclusively for at least for 16 weeks; 58 pairs entered and 45 pairs completed the study. INTERVENTION: Solid foods were introduced at a time determined by the mother and the pediatrician; solid foods from controlled lot numbers were provided for each infant. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After solid foods were added, daily human milk intake declined at a rate of 77 gm/mo (p less than 0.001). Milk composition did not change during the observation period. Daily total energy intake increased 29 kcal/mo, but no changes were noted in energy intake when consumption was normalized for body weight. Weight (National Center for Health Statistics percentiles) at 28 weeks was 13 percentiles lower than that at birth, and length at 28 weeks was 1 percentile lower than at week 1. Weight and length percentiles at 28 weeks, when compared with peak values at 8 weeks, had dropped 19 and 14 percentiles, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Energy intake of human milk-fed infants did not increase after solid foods were added to their diet but was maintained at approximately 20% below recommended levels. Energy intake appeared to reflect infant demands. These data suggest that the recommendations for the energy requirements of infancy should be reevaluated. The growth pattern of exclusively breast-fed infants differs from that of the National Center for Health Statistics reference population. These observations raise questions about the adaptive response of human milk-fed infants to different levels of energy intake and about the estimations of energy requirements based on the sum of basal metabolism, activity, growth, and diet-induced thermogenesis.\r"

The 200 patients who were eligible for the study (600 to 2000 gm birth weight) were monitored throughout their initial hospitalization. Of these, 115 patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind, controlled trial to treatment and placebo groups. The remaining 85 infants were not randomly assigned to a group, by parental request, but were followed and analyzed separately. In one patient who received IVIG, transient tachycardia and a decrease in blood pressure developed during an infusion; resolution occurred promptly after the infusion was discontinued. No persistent hepatic or renal abnormalities were noted in either the IVIG- or the placebo-treated group. There were seven episodes of sepsis in the placebo group and nine in the group whose parents refused consent to the study. No infant who received IVIG acquired nosocomial sepsis (p less than 0.01). All patients in the placebo group in whom sepsis developed had serum IgG levels less than 400 mg/dl at the time sepsis developed. Serum IgG levels were maintained near 700 mg/dl in patients who received IVIG. These data indicate that administration of sufficient IVIG to maintain target serum IgG levels throughout hospitalization may decrease the incidence of nosocomial sepsis in preterm infants.\r"

Studying the question of the geographic spread of the HIV infection epidemic (rather than the AIDS epidemic) has been difficult largely because most serial seroprevalence data have been gathered from cohorts of high risk individuals (e.g., homosexual/bisexual cohorts) in New York City, San Francisco, and other geographically circumscribed areas. The U.S. military applicant HIV screening data were used in the current report to examine rates and 24 month temporal trends in geographic areas characterized by their HIV endemicities. The data examined concern the seven most populous states and four hyperendemic metropolitan areas located within those states (New York City, Miami, Houston, and San Francisco). In the nonepidemic regions, seroprevalence rates increased among black and white applicants. In the four epidemic urban areas, only young black applicants had higher HIV seroprevalence rates during the second 12 month period. Six of the seven nonepidemic regions had positive HIV seroprevalence trends, and these trends were significant in Florida, California, Texas, Illinois, and Ohio. The increases in these regions were greater for young blacks (30% excess for year 2 vs. year 1) compared to young whites (12% excess for year 2 vs. year 1). These data provide evidence of birth year specific increases in seroprevalence over time occurring in presumed low HIV prevalence areas. These increases cannot be due to, but are observed in spite of, biases associated with increasing self-selection over time.\r"

Seropositive subjects (N = 54) were compared with demographically matched seronegative controls regarding drug use practices, homosexual contact, blood transfusions, risk behaviors while traveling or living in high prevalence areas, and acquaintance with persons with AIDS. With the exception of needle sharing with homosexual/bisexual males, no differences in risk behaviors were found between seropositive subjects and matched seronegatives. Seropositives were substantially more likely than matched seronegatives to report having shared a needle with a homosexual or bisexual male, suggesting that needle sharing between homosexual/bisexual IVDAs and heterosexual IVDAs may be an important means by which HIV is introduced among heterosexual IVDAs in low prevalence areas.\r"

These included 97 blood donors, 577 persons given blood components or products, and 497 controls. A significantly higher proportion of anti-HIV-1 positive than -negative donors were anti-CMV-positive, a finding associated with homosexual contact among some of the former. Among subjects with treated clotting disorders, there was no difference in prevalence of anti-CMV or anti-EBV between anti-HIV-1-positive and -negative persons. The prevalence of antibodies to EBV early antigens showed no relationship to anti-HIV-1 status. Anti-CMV positivity in anti-HIV-1-negative donors was associated with an increase in mean CD8 counts and lower mean CD4/CD8 ratio. Anti-CMV and anti-EBV positivity in anti-HIV-1-positive subjects with treated clotting disorders was not associated with a lower CD4 or higher CD8 count than HIV-1 infection alone. Subjects who developed AIDS after enrollment had no significant difference in median time from entry to diagnosis when analyzed by serologic evidence of CMV and EBV antibody status at entry, and a few subjects had AIDS at entry without serologic evidence of prior CMV or EBV infection. The overall results are consistent with acquisition and progression of HIV-1 independently of coincident CMV or EBV infection.\r"

Fifty-seven patients, aged 20-54 years, 28 homosexuals and 29 heterosexuals, classified as CDC II-III (40 patients) and CDC IV (17 patients) were studied. No neurological symptoms or signs were present on bedside examination or questioning for all of the CDC II-III patients. For each conduction measured (H-reflex, sural and sciatic velocities, sural amplitude), the geometric mean was below normal values (p less than 0.05). Among the 57 HIV-infected patients, 20 (35%) had a significant decrease of at least one electrophysiologic measurement: 10/17 CDC IV patients vs. 10/40 CDC II-III patients (p less than 0.05). Two or more simultaneous abnormalities were more often observed in the CDC IV than in the CDC II-III group (9/10 vs. 4/10) (p less than 0.01). In the CDC II-III group, patients with subclinical neuropathies had higher T-helper and lower T-suppressor cell counts and higher T-helper/T-suppressor ratios than random patients without any neurologic abnormalities (1,057 vs. 657 cells/microliters, p less than 0.05, and 757 vs. 1,304 cells/microliters, p less than 0.01, 1.55 vs. 0.68, p less than 0.01, respectively). We conclude that (a) the peripheral nervous system is precociously and subclinically involved in the HIV disease; (b) the patients with infraclinical neuropathies have a significantly higher T-helper cell count than those without any neurologic involvement. The mechanism and the prognostic value of these two findings remain to be more precisely examined, and further studies are required.\r"

Skin tests were read after 48-72 h. A reaction to an antigen was considered positive if there was induration of greater than 2 mm. Cutaneous anergy occurred more often in HIV-seropositive patients than in healthy controls (p less than 0.001) and was most prevalent in patients with advanced HIV illness. HIV-seropositive patients with a positive tuberculin reaction were more likely to have active tuberculosis (TB) than HIV-seropositive patients without a positive tuberculin reaction (p less than 0.001). Therefore, a TB diagnosis should be pursued in HIV-seropositive patients with a positive tuberculin reaction.\r"

The experiments described here show that the p27rex protein negatively regulates the expression of the p42tax protein by suppressing the accumulation of the spliced messenger RNA from which the p42tax and p27rex proteins are made. It is proposed that such an interplay between the two regulatory genes results in a homeostatic system that may regulate the rate of viral replication as well as the growth of HTLV-I transformed cells.\r"

The confirmation and determination of the extent of contamination was attempted in 120 postpartum women with the diagnosis of postpartum endometritis. Each woman underwent endometrial sampling for bacterial culturing utilizing two devices--an unprotected, cotton-tipped swab and a protective, double-lumen catheter with a brush. Although a statistically greater number of bacterial species were recovered with the swab than with the brush (2.4 vs. 1.6, respectively [P less than .001]), they were not representative of species commonly thought of as causing cervicovaginal contamination. Individual species found with greater frequency with the swab were Streptococcus faecalis (P = .023), Escherichia coli (P = .007), Proteus mirabilis (P = .025), Bacteroides bivius (P less than .001 and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (P = .02). Thus, with proper cervical preparation and an extended-reach, transvaginal, cotton-tipped swab, true fundal specimens were obtained that provided a representative and cost-efficient sample of the infected endometrial cavity.\r"

Endometriosis and tubal infertility factor were diagnosed on laparoscopy or laparotomy. The frequency of endometriosis was higher (P less than .05) in patients with coitus during menses (SxMs/F + O) (17.5%) than in the SxMs/N group (10.9%). The frequency of PID was not different between the SxMs/F + O (10.8%) and SxMs/N (9.7%) groups. Thirty-five percent of the infertility patients had a tubal infertility factor. The frequency of tubal infertility factors was higher in the PID group (78.4%) than in the non-PID group (30.4%) (P less than .001). Endometriosis was associated with an increase in tubal infertility factors (47.9% vs. 33.3% in the nonendometriosis group) but to a lesser degree than PID. The frequency of PID in the group with a tubal infertility factor was higher (22.7% vs. no tubal factor, 3.4%) (P less than .001), and the frequency of endometriosis was higher in the group with a tubal infertility factor (19.3% vs. no tubal factor, 11.5%) (P less than .05). Coitus during menses appeared to increase the chances of endometriosis but not of PID. The rate of tubal infertility factors increased in both PID and endometriosis.\r"

Between the OPU and ET days the mean karyopyknotic index dropped by 60% and 13% in group 1 and 2 patients, respectively (P less than .001).

The previously recorded marked reduction in tissue norepinephrine at the end of normal pregnancy was confirmed. When cesarean section was performed because of abruptio placentae/hemorrhage, impending asphyxia, dystocia or preeclampsia, the norepinephrine concentrations were six to ten times higher than in normal pregnancy. When an emergency cesarean section was carried out for premature breech presentation, transverse position of the fetus or prolapse of the umbilical cord (following an otherwise-normal pregnancy), the reduced norepinephrine values were not significantly different from those measured in a control group of women who underwent elective cesarean section. It is possible that the abnormally elevated levels of myometrial norepinephrine are part of the primary pathophysiologic condition associated with sympathetic overactivity, resulting in disturbed myometrial circulation and/or motor activity.\r"

  ".W": "The neurohumoral changes induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in pregnancy have not been described previously. In the nonpregnant adult, ECT causes an acute rise in prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine and beta-endorphin. Because pregnancy alters the production and release of these hormones, consideration should be given to how ECT may further alter the neuroendocrine response, with possible implications for the success of treatment and the fetal response. A 30-year-old woman with a major affective disorder underwent a course of ECT beginning at 23 weeks' gestation. Serial hormonal assays of peripheral venous samples from -30 to +240 minutes were obtained during her first treatment. The prolactin, ACTH, norepinephrine, epinephrine, beta-endorphin, dopamine and oxytocin levels rose acutely and returned to baseline during observation. The maternal vital signs were stable. No increase in uterine activity or fetal heart rate abnormalities were observed during any treatment. A healthy infant weighing 2,900 g was delivered at term, with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 and no problems. We conclude that there are acute neurohumoral changes in specific hormones with ECT in pregnancy, but none of these changes appeared to adversely affect the fetus in our case.\r"

At these concentrations SP and its fragments also inhibited CL and aggregation evoked by subsequent addition of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), an effect that may depend on desensitization. However, at lower concentrations (1-10 nM) SP was able to prime human neutrophils to enhanced CL and enzyme release stimulated by fMLP. These findings indicate that, in addition to direct activation of CL and aggregation, SP also modulates neutrophil function and can thus amplify the release of potentially cytotoxic substances, a possible mechanism for nervous system involvement in rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

For arteries of all sizes, the area of the intima and percent luminal occlusion were greater in the limited and diffuse (no renal crisis) groups than in controls, and these differences were statistically significant for large and medium sized vessels. The greatest luminal occlusion was found in limited cutaneous patients, and especially those with clinical evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension, providing a rationale for the poor response to vasodilator therapy in these patients.\r"

These results suggest that respiratory symptoms are very common in CTD and in scleroderma, particularly if Sjogren's syndrome is also present. Our findings also suggest the presence of 2 patterns of interstitial lung involvement in scleroderma. In scleroderma alone this appears to be characterized by the presence of increased neutrophil proportions in the BAL, decreased DLCO, and no increase in gallium uptake within the lung. Where scleroderma is associated with Sjogren's syndrome, there is an increase in the proportion of lymphocytes in the BAL and respiratory symptoms are very prominent, the latter associated with an increase in gallium uptake within the lung. This suggests that Sjogren's is a major determinant of the pattern of interstitial lung disease seen in CTD.\r"

Forty-one of 88 patients with JRA (7 of 10 seropositive, polyarticular onset, 11 of 29 seronegative, polyarticular onset, 16 of 32 pauciarticular onset, and 7 of 17 systemic onset) showed elevated levels of antibodies to PG-PSP in their sera. IgM rheumatoid factors (RF) were demonstrated in 70/88 isolated IC fractions of patients with JRA and IgG RF in 7; however, none of the patients demonstrated the presence of antibodies to PG-PSP in their isolated IC fractions from the anti-HIgM affinity column.

The amount of circulating FVIIIRAg seemed to be independent of values for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, implying that it was not just another acute phase reactant.

Within the osteoarthritic (OA) groups, young OA had higher levels of all elements than old OA, and significantly greater levels compared to young normals. In addition, GAG content was dramatically increased in young OA. Old OA did not differ from old normals for any elements although GAG levels decreased. Collagen was shown to be stable with increasing age in both normal and OA cartilage, but decreased in OA cartilage. This macaque model of spontaneous OA is valuable because it demonstrates early OA changes typical of experimental models and late changes similar to human OA.\r"

  ".U": "90064582\r", 
  ".W": "The cytochrome P450 (CYP) systems catalyze the metabolic transformation of a wide variety of xenobiotics including procarcinogens present in cigarette smoke condensate as well as atmospheric pollutants. The CYP1A1 isoenzyme is of particular interest because it has been implicated as a risk factor in the etiology of lung cancer in heavy cigarette smokers. The identification and expression of the structural CYP1A1 gene in either normal human lung or lung cancer cells has not been reported. Because of its potential significance in human lung cancer, we investigated the expression of the CYP1A1 structural gene in 24 established human lung cancer cell lines including 15 non-small cell (eight adenocarcinomas, three large cell undifferentiated carcinomas, two bronchioloalveolar cell carcinomas, and two squamous cell carcinomas) and nine small cell lung carcinomas. CYP1A1 mRNA was detected in 14 of 15 (93%) of the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines examined following 24-hour treatment with benz[a]anthracene (BA) and in nine of 15 (60%) of the non-small cell lines cultured without an inducer in the medium. When the small cell lung cancer lines were evaluated for CYP1A1 gene expression, two of nine (22%) expressed detectable CYP1A1 mRNA in both BA-induced cell cultures and constitutive (control) cultures. A positive correlation was noted between BA-induced CYP1A1 mRNA levels and the corresponding aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity expressed as absolute BA-induced enzyme activity (r = 0.74; P less than .01; n = 24), which further demonstrated that CYP1A1 mRNA expression reflects CYP1A1 enzyme activity in the individual cell lines. These observations represent the first known demonstration of constitutive (non-induced) CYP1A1 gene expression in human cells and suggest altered regulation of the CYP1A1 gene in selected lung cancer cell lines. These human pulmonary carcinoma cell lines, which have documented regulatory defects, could be useful for further identification of the mechanisms associated with CYP1A1 gene regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The tumor cell laminin receptor is a cell-surface protein that binds laminin with high affinity (Kd = 1.0 nM). The putative ligand-binding domain of the laminin receptor has been molecularly cloned and sequenced. In the present study, we used the predicted amino acid sequence of the laminin receptor to generate synthetic peptide antigens and produced immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-laminin receptor monoclonal antibodies. The disulfide bond group of the IgM molecule was used to couple the antibodies to the surface of liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin. The anti-laminin receptor monoclonal antibodies coupled to the liposomes bound avidly to the surface of MDA-MB-435S (MDA-435) human breast carcinoma cells, which have high numbers of laminin receptors. These antibody-coupled liposomes exhibited a low degree of binding to Hs 578Bst (Hs 578) normal human breast epithelial cells, which express a low number of laminin receptors. Excess liposomes competed for the binding of unbound laminin to the tumor cell surface, and excess laminin competed for binding with the liposomes. Antibody-coupled liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin were specifically more efficient in inhibiting colony formation by MDA-435 cells in vitro than unbound doxorubicin or liposomes without anti-laminin receptor monoclonal antibodies. Unbound doxorubicin inhibited thymidine uptake by 10%-20% in both Hs 578 and MDA-435 cells, whereas the antibody-coupled liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin inhibited thymidine uptake by 90% in MDA-435 cells but only 15% in Hs 578 cells. Thus, use of anti-laminin receptor monoclonal antibodies coupled with liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin represents a new strategy for selective targeting of doxorubicin to carcinoma cells with exposed laminin receptors.\r"

  ".W": "A case-control study involving interviews with 1,249 patients with lung cancer and 1,345 population-based controls was conducted in Shenyang, an industrial city in northeastern China, where mortality rates are high among men and women. Cigarette smoking was found to be the principal cause of lung cancer in this population, accounting for 55% of the lung cancers in males and 37% in females. The attributable risk percentage among females is high compared to elsewhere in China, largely because of a higher prevalence of smoking among women. After adjustment for smoking, there were also significant increases in lung cancer risk associated with several measures of exposure to air pollutants. Risks were twice as high among those who reported smoky outdoor environments, and increased in proportion to years of sleeping on beds heated by coal-burning stoves (kang), and to an overall index of indoor air pollution. Threefold increases in lung cancer risk were found among men who worked in the nonferrous smelting industry, where heavy exposures to inorganic arsenic have been reported. The associations with both smoking and indoor air pollution were stronger for squamous cell and small cell carcinomas than for adenocarcinoma of the lung. Risks due to smoking or air pollution were not greatly altered by adjustment for consumption of fresh vegetables or sources of beta carotene or retinol, prior chronic lung diseases, or education level. The findings suggest that smoking and environmental pollution combine to account for the elevated rates of lung cancer mortality in Shenyang.\r"

This finding is based on the results of our 1979 questionnaire survey of life-style and the 8-year (1980-1987) follow-up of mortality among 5,231 Mormon high priests and 4,613 wives 25-99 years of age. Our study, which is the first prospective cohort study of Mormons, shows low standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for this population, relative to those for whites in the general population in the United States, which are defined as 100. The SMRs for males are 47 for all cancers, 52 for cardiovascular diseases, and 47 for all causes; the SMRs for females are 72 for all cancers, 64 for cardiovascular diseases, and 66 for all causes. For middle-aged high priests adhering to three health practices (never smoking cigarettes, engaging in regular physical activity, and getting proper sleep), the SMRs are 34 for all cancers, 14 for cardiovascular diseases, and 22 for all causes. These results have been largely replicated in an active Mormon-like subgroup (white nonsmokers attending church weekly) from a representative sample of residents of Alameda County, CA. Our findings confirm and expand on previous descriptive studies of Mormons and demonstrate how these results can be generalized.\r"

These mice lived longer than the mice given injections of the parental P1.HTR tumor. However, one clone, which expressed a high level of H-2Kb antigen, was rejected completely by the syngeneic DBA/2 mice and induced a generation of H-2Kb-specific cytotoxic T cells. Interestingly, the mice that had rejected the clone with high H-2Kb expression received strong anti-tumor immunity for rejection of the parental P1.HTR tumor challenged at the high dose.\r"

The variation in cancer incidence among respiratory tract subsites was remarkable for squamous cell carcinoma, but the variation was less prominent for adenocarcinoma. The rates of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma along the airways correspond closely with the deposition pattern of large and small smoke particles, respectively. Also, the rates of adenocarcinoma parallel the distribution of surface glandular cells of the respiratory tract. Our results support the hypothesis that anatomy and physiology, in conjunction with size of particles in inhaled cigarette smoke, play an important role in the genesis of specific histologic types of respiratory tract cancers.\r"

Using individualized pharmacokinetic determinations, the regimens were revised as necessary to provide optimal blood levels. Because of variable volumes of distribution and elimination rates, dosing according to standard clinical guidelines produced significantly lower peaks than did pharmacokinetically determined regimens for gentamicin (p less than 0.005), tobramycin (p less than 0.0001), and vancomycin (p less than 0.05). Importantly, fewer patients achieved therapeutic levels with the original regimens than with the revised regimens for gentamicin (9% vs. 91%, p less than 0.0005), tobramycin (27% vs. 92%, p less than 0.0001), and vancomycin (30% vs. 69%, p less than 0.0001). Individualized pharmacokinetic analysis of potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics in critically ill patients is essential if therapeutic, non-toxic levels are to be maintained.\r"

Surgical educators have expressed concern about the adequacy of postgraduate trauma education in light of this trauma epidemic. The purpose of this report was to evaluate our residents' trauma exposure and to examine the associated cost of training a physician to treat critically injured patients. From July 1982 through June 1987, 38,714 patients were evaluated for injuries in the emergency department. Five thousand sixty-one patients required admission to the hospital, and of these, 2,045 were admitted to the intensive care unit. In addition, 3,851 major trauma operations were performed during this 5-year period. The majority of these procedures were neurosurgical and orthopedic; however, we have seen an increasing percentage of abdominal operations in the last 2 years. The last five graduating chief residents averaged 181 major trauma operations during their training. The hospital currently writes off an average of $250,000 per month in trauma patient non-collections. This averages to 1.5 million dollars per resident for 5 years of trauma education in our institution. It is imperative that we continue to train trauma surgeons to manage critically ill patients; however, society must address the enormous cost of doing so.\r"

The ETC may be used as an esophageal obturator or an endotracheal airway. Previous studies yielded a significantly higher mean arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) during ventilation using an ETC in the esophageal position compared to a conventional endotracheal airway (ETA). To investigate this phenomenon, endotracheal and airway opening pressures were examined in 12 patients in randomized order during ventilation with an ETC in the esophageal position, with an ETA, and with a mask, respectively. In this study again the PaO2 was higher with ETC compared to ETA. The following differences in intratracheal pressure and flow could be found for ETC when compared to ETA: smaller rising pressure during inspiration, prolonged expiratory flow time, and formation of a small positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). These factors may be responsible for the improved oxygen tension with ETC. Comparing mask to ETC ventilation, PaO2 did not differ; however, mean arterial carbon dioxide tension was higher during mask ventilation.\r"

Sixty-one patients were reviewed, 47 males and 14 females, with a mean age of 34 years. Twenty-five patients (41%) were transported by ground ambulance, 33 (54%) by helicopter, three (5%) by fixed-wing aircraft. Forty-three patients (70.5%) had cervical spine injuries, 11 (18%), thoracic spine injuries, and seven (11.5%), lumbar spine injuries. Fifty-one patients (84%) were transferred within 24 hours of injury. A variety of standard methods of stabilization were used during transport. No patient suffered ascending level of injury as a result of early transfer. Level of function improved before discharge in 26 of 61 patients (43%); patients transported within 24 hours were more likely to show improvement (25/51) than those transported after 24 hours (1/10). There was no significant difference in the probability of improvement between ground (8/25) or air (18/36) transport. Skeletal traction was used before transfer in only four of 43 patients with cervical spine injuries, and was maintained as a method of long-term stabilization in two patients. We conclude that acute SCI patients can be safely transported by air or ground using standard precautions. Distance and extent of associated injury are the best determinants of mode of transport. Skeletal traction does not appear to be a prerequisite for safe, early transfer of SCI patients.\r"

  ".W": "Hemorrhagic shock and closed head injury often accompany severe trauma. Hypertonic saline may be beneficial in these patients, but few have examined its properties when sufficient volume is infused to achieve sustained resuscitation. Solutions of 6% NaCl (HS), 0.9% NaCl (NS), 6% hetastarch (HE), and whole blood (WB) were used to resuscitate swine in hemorrhagic shock (MAP less than 30 mm Hg). The endpoint of resuscitation was normal oxygen delivery (DO2). Measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and intracranial elastance (ICE) were made in the absence and presence of an epidural mass, created by inflating an epidural balloon. HS resuscitation resulted in a lower ICP [5 +/- 1 versus 9 +/- 2 (HE), 17 +/- 3 (NS), and 10 +/- 3 (WB) mm Hg; p = 0.016], and normalization of CPP throughout resuscitation. Animals resuscitated with NS had a lower CPP by the end of resuscitation [CPP = 45 +/- 4 for NS group, versus 63 +/- 4 (HE), 66 +/- 4 (HS), and 63 +/- 5 (WB) mm Hg; p = 0.009]. ICE fell markedly in the HS group, [a decrease of 12 +/- 2 vs. a rise of 5 +/- 3 (HE), 2 +/- 3 (NS), and 6 +/- 3 (WB) mm Hg/ml; p = 0.0005]. This improvement was even more dramatic in the presence of an epidural mass [a fall of 21 +/- 3 vs. no change (HE, WB) and a rise of 4 +/- 3 (NS) mm Hg/ml; p = 0.0005]. For hemorrhage accompanied by severe head injury, resuscitation with HS may benefit victims by decreasing ICP and diminishing the effects of an intracranial mass.\r"

  ".W": "In a series of 988 autopsied victims of road crashes, there were 36 (3.6%) cases of gross primary brainstem injury. These fell into three groups. The first comprised eight cases of pontomedullary tearing without other gross brain injury: in seven of these, there were associated atlanto-occipital dislocations and/or high cervical fracture-dislocations. The usual cause appeared to be facial impact inducing acute hyperextension. Second, there were 17 cases of pontomedullary tearing associated with other brainstem lacerations and/or major damage elsewhere in the brain: in all, there were fractures of the skull base, typically transverse middle fossa fractures. Most of these injuries appeared to be due to facial impacts transmitting force to the anterior skull base, although hyperextension was also a factor in some. There was a third heterogeneous group of 11 cases with brainstem lacerations in sites other than the pontomedullary junction: in some of these it appeared that the impacts had caused skull base fractures by inducing calvarial torsion. In this series, the proportion of motorcyclists (41.7%) was double the expected figure. The use of a helmet modifies the mechanisms of impact head injury; the overall benefits of helmet use are well established, but there is need for more research on helmet design.\r"

Sources of inter-individual variations were also studied and the interrelationships between anxiety, depression, and pain were investigated. Forty-two adult patients hospitalized for burn injuries participated in the study. The McGill Pain Questionnaire and a visual analogue scale were employed to measure the pain experienced at rest and during therapeutic procedures. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and visual analogue scales. The results showed that the pain varies greatly from patient to patient and undergoes wide fluctuations over time in each patient. The greatest pain is usually experienced during therapeutic procedures, the patients reporting significantly more pain on these occasions than at rest. Variations in pain severity were not related to socio-demographic characteristics of the patients, the length of time elapsed since the injury, or the quantity of analgesics administered. The extent of the burns was a significant predictor of pain but only in the first week after the injury. High levels of anxiety or depression were not necessarily associated with higher pain scores during therapeutic procedures but the patients who were more anxious or depressed tended to report more pain when at rest. These results are discussed in relation to pain management strategies, with particular emphasis on the need for the analgesic therapy to be highly individualized and frequently adjusted.\r"

  ".W": "Over a 2-year period 1,116 children admitted to an urban teaching hospital were studied prospectively. The overall group was analysed as to the nature of the injury and a subgroup of seriously injured children was identified and further analysed. All deaths were examined as to their cause and possible preventable as well as salvageable factors. The predictive value of the Trauma Score (T.S.) and Method of Injury (M.O.I.) were evaluated for their prospective prediction of serious injury as determined by the Injury Severity Score and outcome. Most of the children were not seriously injured, with the most common injury being due to a fall (57%) and involving a single injury to the upper limb. With the subgroup of 143 children (13% of the total) who suffered serious injuries, the cranial cavity (90%) was the most common site of injury, occurring most often in pedestrians (31% of the total injured). There were 16 deaths in the series, representing 1.4% of all paediatric trauma admissions and 11% of the admissions who were seriously injured. All deaths were related to motor vehicle accidents and associated with serious head injury. A Trauma Score less than or equal to 12 accurately included all deaths but when correlated with the I.S.S., the Trauma Score had a specificity of 99% and a positive predictive value of 86%; its sensitivity was only 27%. The Method of Injury was associated with an overtriage rate of 300% in relation to the I.S.S.. Of children admitted following pedal cycle accidents only 9% were wearing helmets. Of car occupants injured, 39% were unrestrained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measured energy expenditure (% of predicted) was significantly lower in the pentobarbital group (n = 4) versus control (n = 3) (76 +/- 23% versus 132 +/- 28%, respectively, p less than 0.01). Similarly, 24-hour urinary nitrogen excretion was lower for the barbiturate group compared to control (11.2 +/- 4.0 gm versus 19.5 +/- 3.3 gm, respectively, p less than 0.01). No statistical difference was noted for urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion between the barbiturate and control groups (43 +/- 12 mcg/day versus 47 +/- 14 mcg/day, respectively, p = N.S.). Barbiturate therapy decreases measured energy expenditure and reduces nitrogen excretion without significantly altering 3-methylhistidine excretion in head-injured patients. The metabolic effects of pentobarbital may enable the ability to achieve energy and nitrogen equilibrium during metabolic support of acutely head-injured patients.\r"

Both groups were closely matched with regard to fractures of the lateral and medial malleolus. The long-term results were significantly poorer when a fracture of the posterior tibial margin was additionally present, even in cases with a small marginal fragment of the lip of the tibia. Further, we found a clear relationship between the articular involvement and the incidence of post-traumatic osteoarthrosis in cases with no additional osteosynthesis of the fragment. In cases of larger fragments, the long-term results after anatomic reduction and additional osteosynthesis were on the whole far better than in cases treated conservatively.\r"

Impacts were delivered through a belt interface to the external ventrodorsad dimension of the lower abdomen at L4. A combination of a velocity and compression varying from 1.6-6.6 m/s and 6-67%, respectively, constituted one impact. Logist analysis indicated that maximum Compression (Cmax), maximum Viscous response (VCmax), and particularly peak Force-maximum Compression (FmaxCmax), were effective correlates to injury severity at AIS greater than or equal to 3 and 4. Statistical fit to AIS greater than or equal to 4 injury probability was strongest with a multi-parametric Logist analysis of Cmax and VCmax which indicated that abdominal injury may be related to both a velocity and compression mechanism. Force-deformation curves, characterized by a gradual, almost linear rise followed by rapid unloading, provided information on the stiffness of the lower abdomen in response to belt loading. Force-deflection curves based on total load indicated a reasonable correlation (R2 = 0.61) between estimated lower abdominal stiffness and velocity.\r"

Groups I and II compared closely with regard to age, sex, fracture type and location, and mechanism of injury. The alignment, leg length, length of hospitalization, and length of therapy were analyzed. Our experience indicates that closed retrograde Ender nailing of diaphyseal femur fractures is an ideal technique where operative reduction and stabilization are indicated in older children. The technique yields results superior to conventional methods of treatment, with the advantage of early discharge from the hospital and return to school.\r"

Of the patients 37 were treated without preoperative Double-J* stenting, while 24 underwent Double-J stenting before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Of the patients with incomplete staghorn calculi (C4) and a preoperative ureteral stent 85% were free of stones after 6 months in contrast to only 52.4% of those without a stent and 85.7% of those with infected C4 calculi who underwent preoperative stenting. Hospitalization decreased from 17.7 days in patients without a stent to 14.2 days after stenting, followed by the number of auxiliary procedures (nephrostomy, Zeiss loop and ureteroscopy) and postoperative complications. Complete staghorn calculi (C5) without a preoperative stent had the smallest success rate of stone elimination: only 43.7% of the patients were free of stones after 6 months with a rehospitalization rate of 62.5%. For incomplete staghorn renal calculi (C4) extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy monotherapy with a preoperative Double-J stent is the noninvasive method that offers excellent stone elimination (85%), comparable to the results of percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (with or without complementary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) and anatrophic nephrolithotomy.\r"

Few symptoms were present in a large percentage of patients despite urinary obstruction, decreased renal function, infection and in several cases impending sepsis. Large stone burdens, bilateral treatment, inability to debulk stone burden before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and unexpected fragment movement were definite predisposing factors in the development of this complication. Double pigtail stents and percutaneous nephrostomy alone did not always prevent or resolve the problem. Combined use of percutaneous nephrostomy and ureteroscopic ultrasonic or laser lithotripsy appears to be the most effective treatment modality in patients who fail brief observation. This approach can be combined under appropriate circumstances with a secondary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy treatment in the staged management of complex upper urinary tract calculous disease.\r"

Mucosal aneuploidy was found with few exceptions in aneuploid tumors only, and in a significantly lower frequency in aneuploid tumors of grade 2 than grade 3. The individual specificity of bladder tumors is emphasized by the observation that the level of ploidy was mostly the same in aneuploid mucosal biopsies as in the exophytic tumor. This is underlined further by the occurrence of cell populations of the same ploidy in different parts of the bladder mucosa. However, S-phase values of the concomitant intraurothelial lesions were significantly lower than those of the exophytic tumors. Therefore, we concluded that the process of evolution from malignantly transformed lesions, confined to the urothelium, to an exophytic or invasive tumor is dependent on a further elevated proliferation of the urothelial lesions.\r"

Data on 121 consecutive patients treated with radical radiation between 1981 and 1985 are presented. Over-all actuarial survival of the patient population (median age 70 years) was 31.6% at 5 years and cause-specific survival was 44.8%. At analysis 33 of 121 patients (27.3%) were alive with preserved bladder function. Independent prognostic factors for cause-specific survival and for complete response with radical radiation were tumor configuration, hemoglobin level and clinical stage. The rate free of local relapse was significantly influenced by stage and presence of coexistent carcinoma in situ. The study suggests that factors other than stage and grade influence prognosis in invasive bladder cancer and should be considered in interpreting treatment results.\r"

We evaluated the possible significance of the degree of histological differentiation of the primary tumor to the course of the disease. Of the 23 cases of carcinoma in situ or well differentiated disease only 1 became metastatic, while of the 35 cases of moderately to poorly differentiated disease 31 metastasized to the groin.

Of the patients 13 subsequently were treated with chemotherapy alone, 6 with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection alone, and 7 with chemotherapy and an operation, while 5 seminoma patients were treated with radiotherapy. The patients were examined 3, 6 and 18 months after orchiectomy. Each patient was required to fill out a questionnaire to gather information relative to their work activities, emotional relationship with the partner and sexual life. The patients also completed an assessment form on the quality of life (Spitzer QL-Index) and a series of horizontal analogues to evaluate anxiety, mood, nausea, weakness and general health status. The statistical analysis of the linear and quadratic components for the variables under study was done with the general linear model for block design. Psychosocial adaptability of these patients, regardless of the treatment they underwent, in time became progressively less problematic and the development of psychosocial problems during the long-term adjustment was low. Only 2 patients reported worsening of the emotional relationship with the partner after treatment: 1 underwent chemotherapy and an operation, and 1 underwent radiotherapy. With regard to sexual life, no serious dysfunction was noted apart from the loss of ejaculation in 11 of 13 patients who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Of our sample patients who had lost ejaculation only 2 suffered from a high state of anxiety. The anxiety scores on the last completed linear analogue were 2.6 and 4.1, whereas at the same time the mood scores were 1.9 and 4.4. Therefore, it is important for the clinician to assess the psychogenic aspect of this side effect when this type of operation is proposed.\r"

Chemotherapy-related complications occurred in 55 of 141 patients (39%), including 6 (4.3%) treatment-related deaths. Chemotherapy-related complications were correlated to the initial extent of disease (p equals 0.021) and to more than 4 cycles of cisplatin-based therapy (p equals 0.001). Retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy-related complications occurred in 48 of 148 patients (32.4%) without surgical mortality and were not statistically increased in those performed after chemotherapy. Kidney loss occurred in 6 patients (4.1%) after retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. Nine of 110 patients (8.2%) treated with radiotherapy experienced an early therapy-related complication, while late complications included 3 gastrointestinal strictures requiring surgical intervention 8 to 10 years after radiotherapy. Only 1 secondary malignancy (other than contralateral testis cancer) was discovered in this review. Initial extent of disease was the best predictor for over-all complication rate and higher over-all complications were noted in the cisplatin era (1979 to 1987) but these associations were not necessarily present for complication rates of individual therapies.\r"

All patients received induction chemotherapy (10 platinum-based) followed by retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The inferior vena cava was resected from just below the renal veins to the bifurcation of the iliac veins. Complete resection of retroperitoneal disease was accomplished in all patients. Five patients had postoperative complications, including 2 small bowel obstructions, 1 prolonged ileus and 2 persistent lymphatic leaks. Mean hospital stay was 37 days (range 27 to 49 days) versus 12 days (range 8 to 16 days) for noncomplicated recoveries. No long-term sequelae related to the vena caval resection have occurred with followup of 24 to 80 months. Seven patients are without disease, with a mean followup of 36 months (range 24 to 60 months). We conclude that en bloc vena caval resection for thrombosis of the vena cava allows for complete resection and simplifies the procedure with acceptable morbidity.\r"

One patient required 7 injections. Treatment was unsuccessful in 1 patient in whom a local allergic reaction developed. Only 1 patient complained of pain, and other complications were rare and mild. On the basis of this experience we concluded that sclerotherapy with phenol 2.5% is a painless, highly effective, safe and economical procedure that permits one to avoid an operation, anesthesia and hospitalization. Its use is warranted in adults and particularly in the elderly.\r"

Of the 22 patients 7 (31.8%) did not reach 12 months of followup for different reasons. The remaining 15 patients were followed with clinical evaluations, urine cultures, transrectal ultrasound, voiding urethrography and urine flow rates at 3, 6 and 12 months. Final evaluation at 12 months showed normal voiding in 74% of the patients with an absence of significant post-void residual in all. In 10 patients (67%) urinary flow rates varied between 6 and 14 cc per second and in the remaining it was less than 6 cc per second. In 60% of the patients urine culture was negative. Our results suggest that a spiral urethral prosthesis, placed with the patient under local anesthesia, is an excellent substitute for long-term, indwelling, bladder catheterization, and is a useful alternative to an operation in patients with an increased surgical risk.\r"

There was a significant improvement in subjective symptom analysis and objective urodynamic parameters (peak and mean uroflow rates, maximal detrusor pressure at peak flow, volume at first urge and post-void residual volume) as a result of transurethral incision of the prostate with minimal postoperative morbidity. Antegrade ejaculation was preserved in 55% of the men with normal preoperative ejaculation.

The method offers unique advantages for the urodynamic study of sphincteric function. The patient is placed in the prone position with slight flexion of the hips. The position of the ischial spine is identified topographically using the ischial tuberosities, greater trochanter and lower edge of the ischial-tuberous ligament. Local anesthesia and electrical stimulation then are used to position a needle tip adjacent to the pudendal nerve. This approach allows for specific localization of the nerve for accurate temporary or permanent nerve block. It also permits continuous urodynamic monitoring of pelvic floor behavior with stimulation of the pudendal nerve to assess functional integrity of the nerve and the pelvic floor striated muscles.\r"

The parameters evaluated were patient and graft survival, renal function and interval until transplantation. The patients were matched by computer for age at transplantation, date of transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy used and type of donor. Data were analyzed by the Gehan test. There was no statistically significant difference in patient deaths (1 versus 3), graft survival (75 versus 69%) or graft function between patients with the prune belly syndrome and controls. Patients with the prune belly syndrome waited a shorter interval for transplantation than did controls (no statistically significant difference) because the distensible abdominal wall characteristic of the syndrome permits placement of an adult kidney in a young child. The prune belly syndrome did not adversely affect the outcome of renal transplantation in these patients.\r"

We report on a patient with a fibroepithelial polyp in the distal ureter that resulted in entrapment of a calculus and partial obstruction of the collecting system. Preoperatively, diagnosis by standard radiographic methods, such as excretory urogram, retrograde pyelogram and conventional computerized tomography with and without contrast enhancement, was not possible because of the close proximity of the fibroepithelial polyp, the ureteral calculus and calcifications in the adjacent internal iliac artery. The new diagnostic modality of real-time, multiplanar computerized tomography imaging using the Sun/Pixar computer system and the 2D/3D Orthotool software was used to make the correct preoperative assessment. Subsequently, the patient underwent ureteroscopic resection of the polyp and extraction of the calculus. A year later she was free of symptoms and there was no evidence of regrowth of the polyp. To our knowledge this is the first report to describe the use of real-time, multiplanar computerized tomography imaging as an effective diagnostic modality in the genitourinary tract. In addition, this is the first ureteral fibroepithelial polyp reported in the literature to be associated with a ureteral calculus and to be excised endoscopically with no recurrence on long-term followup.\r"

However, D5D did not localize well to renal cell carcinoma xenografts in vivo despite its highly restrictive in vitro reactivity. The F(ab')2 fragments of A6H produced higher tumor to blood ratios, which probably resulted from fast clearance of the fragments from the circulation.

Treatment with conventional agents and the immunomodulator agent individually and in combination began three days after tumor cell inoculation. PSK used alone was not able to significantly influence tumor growth. In appropriate doses, each conventional agent significantly retarded tumor growth. Used in combination, PSK and conventional agents retarded tumor growth locally and decreased metastatic spread of the tumor. Animals receiving combination therapy had increased life spans over those animals receiving single standard chemotherapeutic agents. Immunomodulation with PSK may enhance the antineoplastic effects of chemotherapeutic agents and offer a treatment option for hormone resistant prostatic cancer.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained in age-matched controls. The bladders from the control rats developed with increasing age an increased micturition volume, a decreased micturition interval, and increased bladder compliance and capacity despite an unaltered bladder weight and unaltered passive and active length-tension relations. The effects of muscarinic blockade were somewhat more pronounced in the older control rats. Following streptozotocin 24 hour diuresis increased rapidly to stabilize within two weeks at a level 15 times higher than the original. This was accomplished initially by an increase in the micturition frequency and then gradually by an increased micturition volume. After six weeks bladder weight had increased more than twofold and did not increase further with time. Despite this both micturition volume and bladder capacity increased from six weeks to six months of diabetes. The diabetic bladders had at low frequencies of stimulation a higher resistance to scopolamine than their age-matched controls. At higher frequencies the resistance to muscarinic blockade showed a similar decrease with age as for the controls. The more pronounced decrease in micturition pressure following atropine treatment in six weeks diabetic rats thus suggests an increased excitation frequency during micturition. No supersensitivity to carbachol was found even after six months of diabetes.\r"

H2O). This increase is statistically significant (p less than 0.024, two-sided t test). During the 90-day experiment, there was no migration of the spheres, minimal local inflammatory response, and no granuloma formation or inflammatory response in various organs studied. Although the leak-point pressure was increased in all of the dogs, none developed difficulty voiding. We conclude that the design concept is sound and safe, the delivery system is reliable, and it is possible to place the spheroidal membrane into an anatomic location that will increase outlet resistance.\r"

By eight to 10 days the proximal straight tubules were noted to be dilated and helically twisted. After two weeks of ureteral obstruction there was dilatation of Bowman's space with encroachment on the glomerular capillary tuft. At this time many proximal convoluted tubules began to show atrophic changes. These morphologic alterations may due in part to back pressure on the nephrons, with retrograde progression as the duration of urinary tract obstruction is increased. The distal convoluted tubule and the descending limb of the loop of Henle were not noted to be abnormal during the study.\r"

So far, it is not known whether comparable changes can be demonstrated in experimentally induced BPH in the dog or in a subhuman primate species. In the present study, the phenomenon of metachromasia could be demonstrated in the prostate of cynomolgus monkeys, too. The reaction was quantitatively intensified by the treatment with androstenedione--an aromatizable androgen which caused hyperplastic and hypertrophic changes--especially a stimulation of the smooth muscle--in the stroma of the prostate. Simultaneous treatment with the aromatase inhibitor 1-methyl-ADD prevented both the phenomenon of metachromasia and the stimulation of the stroma. In conclusion, it is not only possible to induce hyperplastic/hypertrophic changes in the prostate of a subhuman species by means of an aromatizable androgen but, in addition, this effect is accompanied by a phenomenon which is thought to be typical for human BPH suggesting the suitability of this type of experiment for the study of the factors involved in the pathogenesis of BPH.\r"

Seven aneurysms were detected in these three grafts 4 years after implantation. Six aneurysms originated from the bodies of the grafts and one originated from the factory-created anastomosis required for fabrication. Wrinkling and segmentation of the dilated graft documented by arteriography corresponded to mural dissection of the graft wall. Large protrusions near the aneurysms were revealed to be the transmurally dissected graft walls. At the site of dissection, blood escaped through the surrounding mesh of the graft to form a preaneurysmal change. Two aneurysms developed without breakdown of the outer mesh. The aneurysm of factory-created sutures was caused by tearing of the graft wall. Degeneration of human umbilical vein grafts, which appears to ensue inevitably with the passage of time after implantation, leads to the tear of the graft wall and transmural dissection to form aneurysm. In our department, candidates for human umbilical vein graft implantation have recently been restricted to the patients whose life expectancy is limited to only a few years because of the risk of aneurysm formation.\r"

Twelve of the bleeding episodes occurred at the puncture site, and 19 occurred at remote sites, accounting for six of the eight deaths in the series. Management errors were clearly identified in 27 of the 60 complications. The three following patterns of errors were recognized: (1) mismanagement of bleeding (12 instances), (2) wrong patient selection (nine instances), and (3) breach of the administration protocol (six instances). The group of 27 complications with underlying management errors included seven of the eight deaths in the present series. Efforts to prevent complications from thrombolytic therapy should concentrate on the specific patterns of management errors identified. This study indicates that low-dose intraarterial thrombolytic therapy is not a low-risk alternative to surgical intervention but should be viewed as a prelude or possible alternative to surgery in selected patients despite the risks involved.\r"

The patients were divided into those undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm or lower extremity revascularization procedures (group I, n = 120) and those undergoing carotid artery endarterectomy (group II, n = 80). Silent ischemia was detected during the preoperative, intraoperative, or post-operative periods in 60.8% of group I and 67.5% of group II patients. Six group I and three group II patients suffered an acute perioperative myocardial infarction with two cardiac deaths. In both groups I and II a variety of parameters based on monitoring of silent myocardial ischemia were compared between the subgroups of patients who had myocardial infarction and those who did not. The results show that in both groups there was a significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) greater total duration of perioperative ischemic time, total number of perioperative ischemic episodes, and total duration of perioperative ischemic time as a percent of total monitoring time in patients who suffered a perioperative myocardial infarction compared to those who did not. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of preoperative characteristics in all 200 patients showed the occurrence of preoperative silent myocardial ischemia and angina at rest to be the only significant predictors of perioperative myocardial infarction. Thus perioperative monitoring for silent myocardial ischemia might noninvasively identify those patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery who are at increased risk for perioperative myocardial infarction, permitting implementation of timely preventive measures in selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although transaxillary first rib resection is one of the popular treatments for thoracic outlet syndrome today, recurrences and nerve injuries have led to investigation of other operations that might reduce complications and improve results. This article compares the results of transaxillary first rib resection with (1) scalenectomy (anterior and middle) and (2) supraclavicular first rib resection with scalenectomy. Between 1964 and 1987, 668 primary operations were performed for thoracic outlet syndrome on 491 patients. Seventy-one percent were women. Eight-six percent gave histories of neck trauma, often a whiplash injury (traumatic thoracic outlet syndrome); 4.5% had cervical ribs. Common symptoms included paresthesia in the hands (90%); arm pain (80%); neck pain (86%); and occipital headaches (69%). On physical examination, tenderness over the scalene muscles and duplication of symptoms with the arms abducted to 90 degrees in external rotation were present in over 90% of patients. By use of life-table analysis methods, success after surgery was found to be the same for all operations: 91% to 93% at 3 months; 76% to 79% at 1 to 2 years; 70% to 73% at 3 to 5 years; and 69% to 72% at 5 to 10 years. After rib resection plexus injuries occurred in 2.6%, with partial disability in 0.5%. No plexus injuries occurred after scalenectomy, but temporary phrenic nerve palsy occurred in 4.4%. Scalenectomy is as successful an operation as first rib resection for traumatic thoracic outlet syndrome and has fewer serious complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Necrotizing infection of the arterial wall causes rupture and false (\"mycotic\") aneurysm formation, with a very poor prognosis if untreated. Cure can be achieved by surgical drainage and debridement, with restoration of arterial continuity through uncontaminated tissues. The dilemma of applying these principles to the treatment of mycotic aneurysms of the suprarenal aorta is that no remote or extraanatomic routes are available to maintain perfusion to the viscera. We report the first case of Klebsiella suprarenal mycotic aortic aneurysm successfully treated with in situ prosthetic reconstruction of the aorta and visceral arteries, and we have reviewed the 21 other suprarenal mycotic aortic aneurysms reported in the English-language literature. Repair was performed in 20 of the 22 cases, with in situ prosthetic reconstruction performed in 18. Prolonged survival has been achieved in 16 patients after in situ repair. No long-term survival has been reported after extraanatomic reconstruction of the aorta and visceral arteries in patients with such aneurysms. We conclude that in situ prosthetic reconstruction, accompanied by thorough drainage and debridement, prolonged parenteral antibiotic therapy, and permanent suppressive oral antibiotics, offers the best chance for survival in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Walking ability and limb hemodynamics were studied in 56 patients with intermittent claudication in an exercise program. Patients walked 1 hour 3 times a week for 3 to 6 months. Ankle and brachial pressures were measured at rest and after a standard walk, and walking ability on the treadmill and during free walking was determined. Average maximal distance on the treadmill increased from 0.59 to 1.00 km after training (p less than 0.0001). Also, after training 84% of patients were able to walk continuously more than 2 km without severe discomfort. The attained walking ability of individual patients could not be predicted from pressure measurements. Small pressure changes after training suggested that factors other than increased development of collateral vessels were important in determining walking ability. Practically useful walking ability was achieved in patients with aortoiliac and femoropopliteal arterial obstruction in the presence or absence of coronary disease and in patients taking beta-blockers. The results indicate that walking exercise is a valuable treatment for many patients with claudication who are not candidates for arterial reconstruction.\r"

  ".U": "90064898\r", 
  ".W": "Ventricular ejection fraction is widely regarded as a prognostic indicator of perioperative myocardial infarction. To evaluate this premise the prevalence of perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death was analyzed in relation to preoperative resting gated pool ejection fraction in 85 patients undergoing vascular surgery for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of ejection fraction. Group I consisted of 50 patients with ejection fractions of 56% to 92%. Nine (18%) perioperative myocardial infarctions occurred in group I, and there were no cardiac deaths. Group II consisted of 20 patients with ejection fractions of 37% to 55%. Three (15%) myocardial infarctions occurred in this group, and there were no cardiac deaths. Group III included 15 patients with ejection fractions of 20% to 35%. Three (20%) cardiac events occurred in group III including one nonfatal myocardial infarction and two (13%) cardiac deaths. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in prevalence of cardiac events between any group. These results suggest that resting ejection fraction is a poor predictor of perioperative myocardial infarction in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Patients with normal ejection fractions, but underlying coronary artery disease, are still at significant risk for a perioperative cardiac event.\r"

To examine the long-term effects of restenosis, 301 patients having carotid endarterectomy were followed by serial duplex scanning for an average of 4 years. Carotid restenosis, defined as 50% or greater diameter reduction by duplex scanning, occurred after 78 of the endarterectomies; regression of recurrent stenosis occurred in 20 arteries. By life-table analysis the cumulative incidence of restenosis at 7 years was 31%, and the cumulative incidence of regression was 10%. Thus the prevalence of recurrent stenosis at 7 years was 21%. Restenosis developed in women more frequently than men (p = 0.01). Transient ischemic attack occurred in 12% of patients with restenosis, and stroke occurred in 3%; however, the cumulative incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack was not statistically different in those patients with and without restenosis. Similarly, cumulative survival at 7 years was no different. Carotid restenosis usually occurs early in the postoperative period and tends to regress or remain stable during long-term follow-up. A conservative approach to treatment appears justified, since transient ischemic attacks and stroke were rarely associated with restenosis.\r"

The committee recognizes that the completion of training and obtaining a board certificate is testimony to the qualification but not necessarily the competence of an individual to practice vascular surgery. This report identifies three categories of applicant for privileges in vascular surgery; the surgeon who just completed training, the surgeon who completed training after 1984, and the surgeon who completed training before 1984. In addition, the committee recognizes the importance of periodic vascular surgery privileges renewal for established surgeons. Several pathways are defined for use by hospital privilege committees to evaluate the competence of an individual to be granted privileges in general vascular surgery. The ad hoc committee also has outlined a program for evaluation of established surgeons for renewing privileges in vascular surgery using a mechanism of case outcome audit. Finally, a review mechanism, potential corrective actions, and an appeals mechanism are also suggested. This report represents optimal criteria that may require modification by individual hospitals to meet local community needs and standards. It is the hope of the ad hoc committee that this report will help hospitals and practicing physicians improve the quality of care and treatment outcome in patients with vascular disease.\r"

This led to a group of tests directed toward neuromuscular function, which were unrewarding. On referral to our institution a noninvasive venous vascular laboratory examination was performed, which clearly indicated iliac vein obstruction/stenosis, with a normally patent distal venous system. Subsequent repeat phlebography, including direct femoral vein injection, visualized a mass lesion partially occluding the iliac vein. This lesion was treated with primary excision and segmental venous replacement with an interposition graft of autogeneous internal jugular vein. The excised lesion proved to be an epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the iliac vein.\r"

If anything, physicians with adverse claims experience were less likely to make subsequent changes in their practice, such as quitting practice or moving to another state. Physicians with very poor claims histories were more likely to have complaints filed against them with the Florida licensing board, but the sanctions against physicians with either poor or excellent histories were not severe. Physicians with adverse claims experience from incidents that arose between 1975 and 1980 had appreciably worse claims experience from incidents that arose during 1981 to 1983.\r"

Among patients of mental health specialists, there were no significant differences by type of payment in the likelihood of depressive disorder being detected or treated.

The relative risk of hip fracture was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.0) for current users of long half-life benzodiazepines, in contrast to that of 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.3) for current users of short half-life drugs. This finding was not altered by sex, age, calendar year, nursing home residence, or history of hospitalization. Medical record review for a sample of 189 cases suggested that this finding was not due to confounding by dementia, ambulatory status, functional status, or body mass.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a population-based study to examine the association between clinical and Doppler echocardiographic characteristics and physicians' recommendation for endocarditis prophylaxis. Of 127 consecutive Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents with newly documented isolated mitral valve prolapse, endocarditis prophylaxis was recommended three to four times more often in patients under 40 years compared with those more than 60 years of age. Using multiple logistic regression, for every 10-year increment in age, there was a 30% independent reduction in recommendations for endocarditis prophylaxis. Doppler evidence of mitral regurgitation was also independently associated with recommendations for endocarditis prophylaxis. Observations from physical examination, including systolic murmur and systolic click, were weakly associated with endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations. Mitral valve appearance (thickened vs not) was not associated with endocarditis prophylaxis. Although current recommendations for endocarditis prophylaxis and mitral valve prolapse do not address age and Doppler-detected mitral regurgitation, these variables are strongly associated with clinical decisions. Prospective, longitudinal, population-based studies are needed to define endocarditis risk further in subgroups with mitral valve prolapse to provide a more scientific basis for clinical decision making.\r"

A potential etiologic factor may relate to a genetically controlled sensitivity to environmental carcinogens. This study, therefore, examined 20 young adult patients who had squamous cell carcinoma for mutagen-induced chromosome sensitivity. Lymphocytes from respective patients were cultured, exposed to the clastogen bleomycin, arrested during metaphase, and examined quantitatively for chromosome breakage. As compared with an age- and sex-matched control population, as well as a population of patients who had non-squamous cell carcinoma head and neck tumors, the young adult population with squamous cell carcinoma expressed a significantly increased number of bleomycin-induced chromosome breaks per cell. Furthermore, among the study patients, chromosome sensitivity was most apparent in the non-tobacco users and in patients less than 30 years of age. The expression of such chromosome fragility following mutagen exposure should be considered in epidemiologic studies that intend to define risk factors for development of head and neck cancer.\r"

Legally, active euthanasia is a criminal offense, but a pattern of jurisprudence has developed since the first court case in 1973 that has allowed physicians to practice euthanasia under certain strict conditions. Two proposals, one from the Royal Dutch Medical Association and one from a government-appointed state commission, have advised that the current law be changed. While the debate continues, a number of Dutch institutions have developed procedures and policies to enable physicians and health care providers to participate in active euthanasia in an acceptable and controllable manner. However, many Dutch physicians remain uncomfortable with the professional and public tolerance of this practice.\r"

  ".W": "Drug self-reports are often unreliable and standard blood and urine tests detect only recent cocaine use. Since cocaine is deposited in hair, we have applied a radioimmunoassay to hair extract to detect past cocaine use. Hair from 16 adult users was positive for benzoylecgonine, in the presence of negative findings from urine screening tests. Benzoylecgonine in admitted heavy users averaged 8775 ng/g of hair (range, 640 to 29,089 ng/g of hair), whereas in occasional users it averaged 624 ng/g of hair (range, 32 to 1210 ng/g of hair). Benzoylecgonine was not detected in hair of 21 adults who reported no use of cocaine ever and whose urine samples were negative for the metabolite. Neonatal hair from seven infants whose mothers were known cocaine users averaged 5430 ng of benzoylecgonine per gram of hair (range, 200 to 27500 ng/g of hair). Hair from two infants 2.5 and 3.5 months of age averaged 6050 ng of benzoylecgonine per gram of hair. However, values were negative for infants 1 year and older, corresponding to loss of fetal hair in the few months after birth. Because studies reporting reproductive risks of cocaine compare exposed and nonexposed groups, validation of drug-free status of control subjects is extremely important. Hair analysis may remedy the disadvantages of currently used methods and may identify intrauterine exposure to cocaine in babies when a maternal drug history is not available or of doubtful truthfulness.\r"

Half the laboratories reported the serum sample positive for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies as \"indeterminate\"; one laboratory rendered a final positive report without supplemental testing. On the report forms, the actual laboratory results were often obscured and intermingled with information, sometimes incorrect, such as identifying the agent as \"HTLV-III\" (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III) and advising that a test with positive results is evidence of exposure to the virus. Many of these reports have the potential to confuse, rather than to enlighten, the requesting physician.\r"

Three hundred fifty-two apparent discrepancies were not related to the accuracy with which ED faculty interpreted films, resulting in a revised overall discrepancy rate of 1.8%. The second indicator--undesirable patient care outcomes as a result of delayed accurate radiological diagnosis--measured an occurrence rate of 0 after clinical reevaluation of more than 99% of patients within 24 hours of initial ED evaluation. Aspects of the development and use of clinical indicators are discussed in relationship to the broader monitoring and evaluating process necessary for the continuous improvement of patient care.\r"

Gifts cost patients money, and they may change society's perception of the profession as serving the best interest of patients. Also, accepting a gift establishes a relationship between the physician and the drug company that obliges a response from the physician. Accepting gifts and the resulting relationship have ethical implications as well. First, the use of patients' money to pay for gifts can be unjust. Second, the fiduciary relationship between physician and patient may be threatened if prescribing practices are affected (as intended by the drug company). Third, physicians' characters may be altered by a practice that fosters self-interest at patients' expense. We discuss the need for guidelines for the profession to help physicians promote their patients' well-being.\r"

The frequency of high risk behaviors was similar for men and women, but minority subjects engaged in higher levels of high-risk behaviors than did whites. Both age and educational level were inversely related to behavioral risk for HIV infection. Although the current findings are limited due to sample size and representativeness, the results indicate that future research needs to focus on high-risk behaviors for HIV infection among alcoholics, with more attention directed toward prevention and intervention strategies.\r"

The key to the program was the training of a cadre of trainers/advocates in all local Native American and Alaska Native communities served by the Indian Health Service. These people were then supported and assisted in their efforts through a variety of means. Evaluation results of knowledge gained indicate that the local trainers had substantial success in imparting FAS information to a variety of audiences (prenatal groups, school children and community groups). Further, the evaluation samples also indicate that the knowledge was retained by the groups over time (2-4 months) and that there may have been some general diffusion of knowledge among peers in local communities. This program is presented in the hope that it will be replicated and improved upon by similar programs using this model as a base.\r"

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 1.5 or 4.0 g/kg ethanol and the linear decline of blood ethanol level was measured. The parameters measured in each animal were linear ethanol elimination rate (EER), peak blood ethanol level, volume of distribution and Widmark ratio (r). Reproducibility was assessed using two statistical methods, paired t tests and Pearson correlations. Paired t tests indicated good reproducibility since the two replicate determinations did not differ significantly from each other. The other widely used indicator of reproducibility, the correlation coefficient (Pearson r) between the two measurements, was nonsignificant in almost every case, indicating poor reproducibility. This occurs because the range of values of EER is fairly narrow; thus, an individual is likely to fall anywhere within that narrow range from one day to the next, and the rank ordering of the individuals may not be maintained. Although parameters such as EER and volume of distribution appear to be reproducible for populations, they may have little or no utility as covariates in genetic analyses of individual differences in response to ethanol.\r"

Two-hour interview schedules were administered to both samples. The Conflict Tactics Scale was used to assess spouse-to-woman violence. Alcoholic women were found to have higher levels of spouse-to-woman negative verbal interaction, moderate violence and severe violence as compared to the household women. Multivariate analyses revealed that spouse violence scores were strong predictors of type of sample. This was true even after controlling for presence of alcohol problems in the spouse, income, parental violence, parental alcohol problems and changes in parental family. These findings suggest that alcoholism treatment programs should screen for spousal violence among women alcoholics and that victims of spousal violence should be screened for alcohol-related problems.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of alcohol expectancies in predicting postdrinking behavior, two studies were conducted. In Study 1, an instrument assessing alcohol expectancies was devised for later use in prediction. Factor analyses with split-sample validation confirmed 3 factors (11 total items): disinhibition, aggression and sexuality. In Study 2, expectancies, Buss-Durkee hostility and Mosher sex-guilt were assessed in a preexperimental questionnaire session. In a subsequent drink administration session, an expectancy set manipulation led subjects to expect alcohol or to expect tonic. To assess postdrinking behavior, interest in violent, erotic and violent-erotic materials was measured unobtrusively using an ad lib slide-viewing task. Consistent with the hypotheses, expectancies in conjunction with trait hostility significantly predicted violence viewing and violent-erotica viewing for expect alcohol, but not expect tonic controls. Moreover, after variance due to hostility was accounted for, expectancies predicted violence viewing significantly and violent-erotica viewing marginally. These findings provide modest support for the proposition that preexisting alcohol expectancies mediate between the effects of expectancy set and postdrinking behaviors. Once activated by perceived alcohol ingestion, these expectancies can shape postdrinking behaviors. The findings also underscore the need for further experimentation aimed at clarifying the interrelationships between alcohol expectancies and expectancy set.\r"

Parents' self-reported drinking practices in 1960 were compared with those of their adult offspring 17 years later in 1977. A positive association between the drinking level of parents and their adult offspring was evident; however, this association varied according to: (1) the drinking level of the parent, (2) the gender of the offspring and (3) the gender of the parent. There is a tendency for offspring to drink abstemiously (i.e., abstain or drink low volume) when their parents were life-long abstainers. High-volume drinking by adult offspring was associated with the parents' same drinking pattern, especially among daughters. Throughout the spectrum of drinking, sons' drinking was more similar to fathers' drinking level than to mothers'. The relationship between one parent's drinking and his/her offspring's was dependent upon the drinking status of the other parent. These data support the hypothesis that parents' drinking patterns may influence the drinking patterns of the offspring as adults.\r"

  ".U": "90065605\r", 
  ".W": "From 1982 to 1987, 38 consecutive patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect underwent staged unifocalization procedures in preparation for final intracardiac repair of the anomaly. Thirty-six patients had concordant visceroatrial, atrioventricular, and ventriculoarterial connections. A central pulmonary artery confluence was present in 19 patients and absent in the remaining group. All patients with central pulmonary arteries had inadequate peripheral pulmonary arterial arborization. Systemic collateral arteries were present in all 38 patients. The objectives of the unifocalization procedures were the interruption of extracardiac sources of pulmonary arterial blood flow, the restoration of segmental, lobar, and pulmonary arterial confluence, the replacement of missing central pulmonary arterial branches, and the creation of a central, accessible source of pulmonary arterial blood flow. A total of 54 unifocalization procedures were performed in the 38 patients. These procedures included 85 permanent connecting anastomoses, 15 temporary anastomoses to the ascending aorta, 13 angioplasty procedures, and 15 modified Blalock-Taussig shunts. Three patients died after unifocalization (two early and one late). By the end of the study, eight patients were still waiting for further unifocalization procedures or angiographic assessment. Four patients were rejected for further surgical treatment because of persistent, uncorrectable defects of the pulmonary arterial arborization pattern. Twenty-three patients underwent complete intracardiac repair with two deaths (one early and one late). Postrepair, intraoperative right ventricular/left ventricular systolic pressure ratio after complete surgical repair ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 (mean = 0.63, standard deviation = 0.14). At the end of follow-up, 21 survivors of complete repair were free of significant symptoms. Unifocalization procedures designed to improve the pulmonary arterial arborization pattern of patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect with or without central pulmonary arteries can prepare a significant number of these patients for successful intracardiac repair of the anomaly.\r"

There were four male and three female patients. Their mean age was 53.6 +/- 24.1 years. Coronary artery disease was present in five patients, and two patients had idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. The mean preoperative ejection fraction was 42.4% +/- 13.6%. The mean number of ventricular tachycardia morphologies was 1.7 (range 1 to 3). Epicardial mapping was obtained intraoperatively in all seven patients and endocardial data in five of seven patients (71.4%). There were no hospital deaths and no early or late spontaneous recurrence of clinical monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Nonclinical monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was inducible in two patients postoperatively and both were treated with procainamide. Death occurred late after operation in two patients: One death was related to recurrent nonclinical VT at 8 months and one at 3 months was due to carcinoma of the stomach. These results suggest that the transannular approach is feasible in selected cases, especially when computerized mapping systems with endocardial balloon electrode arrays can be used.\r"

  ".W": "From May 1980 to May 1984, preoperative chemotherapy (mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil) was added to radiation therapy in patients with potentially operable squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Of 129 patients observed, 122 were followed up until death or to the present. Only 33 were able to complete preoperative chemotherapy and radiation and undergo resection. There were 28 men and five women, their ages ranging from 42 to 81 years (average 60 years). There were 22 black and 11 white patients. The location of the tumor was in the middle third in 70% of the patients. Among the 33 patients, the clinical TNM classification was as follows: T1 N0 M0, three patients; T2 N0 M0, 27 patients; T2 N1 M0, two patients; and T3 N0 M0, one patient. The length of the lesions when measurable in the absence of complete obstruction varied from 3 to 17 cm (average 7 cm). The operative mortality rate in this group was 12% (4/33). There was no viable residual tumor in the surgical specimen of the esophagus in 33% (11/33) of those patients completing triple therapy. However, in two of the 11 patients, left gastric nodes contained tumor and in one there was a minute esophageal perforation. The 2-year survival rate was 33% (11/33), and the 5-year survival rate was 15.4% (5/33). Among the 11 patients having 2-year survival, the surgical specimen was normal in six and abnormal in five. Of the five patients having 5-year survival, the surgical specimen was normal in three and abnormal in two. The absence of tumor in the surgical specimen did not appear to confer any better chance for long-term survival. Data were compared to our 1967-1975 series of 75 patients receiving only preoperative radiation and resection. There was no significant difference in survival rates at 2 years (20% [1975] versus 33% [1984], p = 0.2118) or at 5 years (10% [1975] versus 15.4% [1984], p = 0.5796). The addition of preoperative chemotherapy as an adjunct did not result in a statistically significant increase in 2-year or 5-year survival rates.\r"

Three cardioplegic solutions were used: Hematocrit values were 17.0% (group I), 8.2% (group II), and 0% (group III). In all groups the slope of the linear stroke work versus end-diastolic volume relationship, a measure of contractility, was unchanged after ischemic arrest. However, the myocardial oxygen consumption for basal metabolism was increased an average of 25.5% after arrest with plasma (group III). Since the plasma concentration in all three groups was identical, and the oxygen available to the hearts during ischemia was the same in groups II and III, the efficacy of blood-based cardioplegic solutions cannot be attributed to a plasma component or to the greater oxygen-carrying capacity of the red blood cell. Future studies should attempt to identify the salutory entity of the red cell responsible for preservation of myocardial oxygen consumption efficiency.\r"

  ".U": "90065610\r", 
  ".W": "Adenosine is a potential cardioplegic agent by virtue of its specific inhibitory properties on nodal tissue. We tested the hypothesis that adenosine could be more effective than potassium in inducing rapid cardiac arrest and enhancing postischemic hemodynamic recovery. Isolated rat hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer or cardioplegic solutions to determine the time to cardiac arrest and the high-energy phosphate levels at the end of cardioplegia. Cardioplegic solutions contained adenosine 10 mmol/L, potassium 20 mmol/L, or adenosine 10 mmol/L + potassium 20 mmol/L and were infused at a rate of 2 ml/min for 3 minutes at 10 degrees C. Both time taken and total number of beats to cardiac arrest during 3 minutes of cardioplegia were reduced by adenosine 10 mmol/L and adenosine 10 mmol/L + potassium 20 mmol/L when compared with potassium 20 mmol/L alone (p less than 0.001). Tissue phosphocreatine was conserved by adenosine 10 mmol/L when compared with potassium 20 mmol/L, being 7.1 +/- 0.2 (mumol/gm wet weight (n = 7) and 6.0 +/- 0.3 mumol/gm wet weight (n = 5), respectively (p less than 0.05). Postischemic hemodynamic recovery was tested in isolated working rat hearts. After initial cardiac arrest, the cardioplegic solution was removed with Krebs-Henseleit buffer at a rate of 2 ml/min for 3 minutes at 10 degrees C, and thereafter total ischemia was maintained for 30 or 90 minutes at 10 degrees C before reperfusion. Adenosine 10 mmol/L enhanced recovery of aortic output when compared with potassium 20 mmol/L or adenosine 10 mmol/L + potassium 20 mmol/L, the percentage recovery after 30 minutes of ischemia being 103.0% +/- 4.4% (n = 6), 89.0% +/- 5.8% (n = 6), and 86.6% +/- 4.3% (n = 6), respectively (p less than 0.05 for comparison between adenosine 10 mmol/L and potassium 20 mmol/L). Thus adenosine cardioplegia caused rapid cardiac arrest and improved postischemic recovery when compared with potassium cardioplegia and with a combination of these two agents.\r"

  ".U": "90065611\r", 
  ".W": "The adequacy of retrograde delivery of cardioplegic solution to the right ventricle and interventricular septum is controversial. To address this issue quantitatively, we infused blood cardioplegic solution labeled with radioactive microspheres (15 microns diameter) into the coronary sinus (n = 8 dogs) at a pressure of 51 +/- 1 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) to be compared with the same quantity of labeled cardioplegic solution (20 ml/kg) delivered through the aorta (n = 6 dogs) at 97 +/- 7 mm Hg. Both methods of delivery produced cardiac arrest, but retrograde infusion required a significantly longer time to complete the infusion (6.2 +/- 0.8 minutes versus 1.5 +/- 0.1 minutes, p less than 0.01). Greater than 99% of the microspheres passing through the vasculature of the left ventricle were trapped in the left ventricular myocardium with antegrade infusion, and the distribution of the cardioplegic solution was uniform. Antegrade delivery (cardioplegic flow x infusion time) averaged approximately 3.0 to 4.0 ml/gm, except at the apex, where delivery averaged approximately 2.0 ml/gm. With retrograde infusion, 93% of the microspheres perfusing the left ventricle were trapped and delivery of the cardioplegic solution was not uniform. In the anterolateral free wall, delivery of cardioplegic solution averaged between 1.5 and 2.9 ml/gm (p less than 0.001 compared with antegrade) and only 0.6 to 0.8 ml/gm in the posteroseptal region of the basal left ventricle (p less than 0.001 compared with the antegrade group and anterolateral samples of the retrograde group). In the middle portion of the right ventricle, antegrade trapping of microspheres was 99% and delivery of cardioplegic solution averaged approximately 2.0 ml/gm. With retrograde delivery, only 16.5% (range 11.8% to 26.0%) of the microspheres passing through the right ventricular vasculature were trapped in the right ventricular myocardium, which indicates that substantial shunting had occurred. Corrected for the high shunt fraction, retrograde delivery of cardioplegic solution to the middle portion of the right ventricle averaged only 0.5 ml/gm (p less than 0.01). Retrograde delivery to the atrial septum and right atrium was also low. Because retrograde delivery of cardioplegic solution was markedly nonuniform, we conclude that inadequate cardioplegic delivery to the middle portion of the right ventricle and posteroseptal portion of the left ventricle could result with cardioplegic infusion through the coronary sinus.\r"

Fourteen sheep were randomly assigned to two groups. In group A (n = 7), the right ventricular cooling catheter system was used in addition to coronary cardioplegic perfusion and systemic hypothermia for myocardial protection. Group B (n = 7) served as a control group. In group A, the right ventricular temperatures were significantly lower than those of the control group (16.1 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C versus 23.9 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees C; p less than 0.0001, Student's t test). The most common temperature range was 12 degrees to 18 degrees C (67.1%, frequency distribution analysis), and 63.2% of temperatures were below 16 degrees C. The catheter system also maintained the temperatures of the interventricular septum at a lower level than those recorded in the control group and prevented septal rewarming, which was significant in group B (from 16.5 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees C to 25.0 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees C; p less than 0.04, Mann-Whitney U test). Left ventricular temperatures were not changed by the catheter system. By better cooling the right ventricle and the septum, the right ventricular cooling catheter system should decrease the prevalence of right ventricular failure and allow more time to safely complete multiple coronary anastomoses in coronary artery bypass graft operations.\r"

Patients with the complex had cardiac myxomas at an early age (average, 26 years) with frequent multiple myxomas (53%) and recurrent cardiac myxomas (22%); however, no histologic differences were noted when these tumors were compared with sporadic cardiac myxomas. In the present study, deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometric analyses of 35 cardiac myxoma specimens were correlated with clinical findings (mean duration of follow-up, 13 years). Among 30 patients with sporadic (nonfamilial) cardiac myxoma, 24 (80%) had a normal (deoxyribonucleic acid diploid) ploidy pattern, and six (20%) had an abnormal (deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid) pattern. Specimens from each of the five patients with the complex had abnormal deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid patterns (p = 0.002 compared with the sporadic myxoma group). Further, all four patients who had recurrent cardiac myxoma had an abnormal deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern (p = 0.007 compared with patients with nonrecurrent myxomas). Unlike conventional histologic examination, the ploidy pattern of cardiac myxomas seems to be sensitive for detecting biologically unusual tumors, and a deoxyribonucleic acid tetraploid pattern suggests a high risk of recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "The Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valve was our bioprosthetic valve of choice between 1981 and 1985 for patients in whom the aortic anulus could not accept a valve larger than 19 mm in outer diameter or in whom the avoidance of warfarin sodium (Coumadin) was important. A series of 117 consecutive patients who received 17 or 19 mm valves for isolated aortic valve replacement or aortic valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass grafting or other valvular procedures was analyzed. Overall, 74% of the patients were female, with a mean age of 70.9 years and a body surface area of 1.67 +/- 0.19 m2; 92.3% were in New York Heart Association class III-IV, and the operation was urgent or emergent in 46%. The operative mortality rate was 7.7%, with no deaths in patients undergoing isolated elective first-time aortic valve replacement. Mean follow-up for survivors was 2.5 years (10 to 62 months). There were 20 late deaths, of which three were valve related, three were due to sudden death or arrhythmias, and two were due to persistent heart failure. The actuarial survival rate at 5 years was 68%. Clinical follow-up revealed a low incidence of valve-related complications, and 96.4% of survivors were in class I-II. Postoperative echocardiography before hospital discharge revealed a maximum instantaneous gradient of 18.4 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in five patients having a 17 mm valve and 31.3 +/- 12.7 mm Hg in 20 patients having a 19 mm valve. Doppler echocardiography was performed in 22 patients at a mean follow-up of 39.3 +/- 11.7 months. The maximum instantaneous gradient was 25 +/- 17.2 mm Hg for 17 mm and 17.41 +/- 5.4 mm Hg for 19 mm valves at late follow-up. The effective orifice area was 0.85 +/- 0.1 cm2 for 17 mm and 1.21 +/- 0.21 cm2 for 19 mm valves. This study defines the normal range of Doppler echocardiographic transprosthetic gradients for the Ionescu-Shiley valve and confirms that low operative mortality and excellent clinical improvement can result from the use of small Ionescu-Shiley valves in elderly patients despite moderate postoperative transvalvular gradients.\r"

  ".W": "Case histories of 2582 patients requiring median sternotomy for coronary artery bypass grafting between January 1982 and August 1986 were retrospectively reviewed. Only saphenous vein grafts were used in 230 patients, one mammary artery graft was used in 1626 patients, and both mammary arteries were used in 726 patients. The relationship of potential risk factors and wound complication was evaluated. The overall incidence of wound complications was 0.81%-0.43% in the saphenous vein graft group, 0.49% in the single mammary group, and 1.65% in the bilateral mammary group. Graft type and a number of potential risk factors were analyzed in a logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors of wound complications. The results indicated that pneumonia, obesity, reexploration, use of the intraaortic balloon pump, and diabetes were significant risk factors contributing to the probability of wound complications. Bilateral mammary grafting was significantly associated with the increased probability of a wound complication developing. Bilateral mammary grafting increased the chance of wound complication nearly five times that of saphenous vein grafting and three times that of single mammary grafting. Mammary artery grafts have been shown to achieve greater long-term patency than saphenous vein grafts, and their continued use is encouraged. However, the potential for increased wound problems should be considered along with other significant preoperative risk factors such as insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and obesity.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic reactions resembling inflammation occur in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. We now report that interleukin-1, an endogenous pyrogen and a key mediator of inflammation, is transiently and consistently generated in vivo by circulating monocytes within hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. Interleukin-1 production was assessed by measuring interleukin-1 functional activity and interleukin-1 beta antigen concentration in cell lysates from monocytes of patients during and after bypass. There was no increase in intracellular interleukin-1 activity during bypass and within the first hours after bypass, possibly because of a suppressive effect of hypothermia on interleukin-1 production, as documented in vitro. Maximal generation of interleukin-1 was observed 24 hours after extracorporeal circulation, concomitantly with the occurrence of a peak in body temperature. The amount of interleukin-1 generated at that time was linearly correlated with the increase in patients' body temperature. The peak in interleukin-1 production followed by 20 hours the peak in complement activation as assessed by determining C3a desArg and C5a desArg concentrations in patients' plasma. These results indicate that interleukin-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of adverse systemic reactions associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

Discriminant analysis performed with preoperative variables revealed preoperative serum creatinine values, concurrent valve and bypass surgery, and age to be significant variables for identifying patients at risk for acute renal failure. The use of these three variables in a discriminant model correctly classified 77% of patients. The addition of intraoperative variables did not significantly improve the ability of the model to correctly classify patients. Acute renal failure was associated with a significant increase in the number of postoperative complications, mortality, and length of hospitalization and intensive care unit stay.\r"

  ".U": "90065618\r", 
  ".W": "To assess independent risk factors predicting the occurrence of clinically significant acute rejection episodes in the first 6 months after cardiac transplantation, we performed a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Forty-three recipients, undergoing transplantation between September 1986 and May 1988, were eligible for analysis and received standardized, low-dose triple drug maintenance immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone. Immunoprophylaxis was supplemented perioperatively with either a polyclonal (antithymocyte globulin, N = 26) or a monoclonal (OKT3, N = 17) anti-T-cell antibody. Investigated, conceivable risk factors comprised recipient and donor age, ischemic time, perioperative anti-T-cell antibody prophylaxis, recipient preoperative status, underlying disease, previous cardiac operation, and histocompatibility parameter (mismatches for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR, HLA-B+DR, HLA-A+B+DR, and Rh0[D] antigen, HLA-DRw6 positive recipient, and identify for ABO system). Univariate analysis suggested significant influence of the type of antibody used perioperatively (p = 0.0024) and the number of mismatches for HLA-A+B+DR (p = 0.0037) and for HLA-B+DR (p = 0.0043). Stepwise logistic regression yielded the number of mismatches for HLA-B+DR (p = 0.0029) and the type of antibody used perioperatively (p = 0.0031) as being highly significant predictors of acute cardiac rejection. Six-month freedom from rejection was 100%, 41%, and 27% for recipients with two, three, and four mismatches for HLA-B+DR and 59% versus 22% for recipients with polyclonal versus monoclonal antibody prophylaxis. Similar to results with kidney transplantation, these results indicate that a poor donor/recipient match for combined HLA-B+DR loci constitutes an independent risk factor for acute graft rejection in low-dose triple drug immunosuppressed cardiac recipients, which stimulates the potential concept of prospective HLA matching. In our experience OKT3 prophylaxis provides significantly less effective prevention of acute rejection than a comparable course of antithymocyte globulin.\r"

This type of time base avoids the disadvantages of a crowded and obscured linear scale or an arbitrary and non-unified split time scale. For clinical application all timed events are initially converted to a common unit such as days. A visually comprehensible logarithmic time scale can be derived by plotting the logarithmic scale (labeled in days, base 2) and then establishing conventional calendar interval marks (weeks, months, years) and the data plot points. A simple equation is presented for establishing the time scale graph markers and the plot data points for a logarithmic time scale of any scale axis length.\r"

To investigate methods of improving preservation in neonatal myocardium, we compared three cardioplegic solutions with topical hypothermia during 120 minutes of ischemic arrest in isolated, blood-perfused, neonatal rabbit hearts. Topical hypothermia (15 degrees C) without cardioplegia resulted in 71% +/- 5% recovery of preischemic contractile function. A high potassium (30 mEq/L) cardioplegic solution resulted in a 76% +/- 6% recovery of function, not significantly different from that obtained with hypothermia alone. In contrast, the St. Thomas' Hospital and Hopital Lariboisiere cardioplegic solutions resulted in recoveries of 89% +/- 6% and 88% +/- 7%, respectively, both of which were significantly greater (p less than 0.001) than recoveries obtained with the high potassium solution or hypothermia alone. Thus the cardioplegic solutions used at St. Thomas' Hospital and Hopital Lariboisiere provided excellent protection during 2 hours of hypothermic ischemic arrest in neonatal rabbit hearts and resulted in functional recovery superior to that achieved with hypothermia alone or with the high potassium cardioplegic solution.\r"

Albumin aggregates (15 to 30 microns) labeled with technetium 99m were injected into the left ventricle during bypass (ventricle), the perfusion cannula during bypass (cannula), and the left ventricle with no bypass (control). Animals were put to death, organs were removed, and the percent distribution was determined with a gamma camera. The Student Newman-Keuls test was used for statistical comparisons. Distribution to both the heart and brain in the cannula group were decreased from control by 55% and 35%, respectively. Distribution to the brain in the ventricle group was also decreased from control by 39%. Intestinal distribution was elevated above control in the ventricle group by 37%, whereas musculoskeletal distribution was elevated 33% above control in the cannula group. No significant changes were noted for the kidneys, stomach, or liver. These data suggest that overall perfusion of some vital organs may be significantly reduced during low-flow extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, specifically in the case of the heart and brain, which may be deprived of oxygenated blood.\r"

The pathological stages of tumours found by accident were little different from those found by intervention. 87% (2532/2923) of signs/symptoms of breast cancer were false alarms--ie, 86% (565/659) of those found by routine physical examination, 88% (406/462) breast self-examination, 93% (220/237) screening mammography, and 86% (1341/1565) accidental discovery. Spontaneous breast pain was responsible for 575 false alarms and nipple discharge for 126. 534 (20%) of the false alarms could have been avoided if routine physical examinations before the age of 45, breast self-examination before the age of 35, and screening mammography before the age of 60 had been discouraged. Another 30% of false alarms would have been avoided if the patient had realised that breast pain and nipple discharge are not usually symptoms of breast cancer.\r"
