  ".W": "The effect of control of houseflies on the incidence of diarrhoea and shigellosis was evaluated in a prospective crossover intervention study at two military field bases several kilometers apart. In early summer, 1988, intensive fly control measures (mainly bait and trap strategy) were introduced on one base, while the other served as a control. After 11 weeks, as new cohorts arrived, the intervention was abruptly discontinued in the first base and instituted in the second for the next 11 weeks. The study was repeated the next summer. Overall, fly counts were 64% lower on the bases exposed to fly control measures (p = 0.024). Concomitantly, clinic visits dropped by 42% (p = 0.146) for diarrhoeal diseases and by 85% for shigellosis (p = 0.015), as did rates of seroconversion, by 76% (p = 0.024) for antibodies to Shigella and by 57% (p = 0.006) for antibodies to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The findings indicate that houseflies, acting as mechanical vectors, transmit Shigella (and possibly enterotoxigenic E coli) diarrhoeal infections.\r"

For R32NS1(81) MPL/CWS is superior to aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, and the data support the evaluation of this complex as an adjuvant for other vaccines.\r"

Twenty male soldiers, aged 18-29 yr, died suddenly and unexpectedly within 24 h of strenuous exercise. Necropsy results, available for 90% of the subjects, included underlying cardiac disease in 50% and noncardiac causes of death in 33.3%; the cause of death was unidentifiable in 16.7% of the subjects. Prodromal symptoms in 70% of the subjects are presented as a main focus of this investigation. The most frequently reported symptom was exertional or nonexertional syncope in 40% of the subjects. Chest pain, acute gastrointestinal symptoms, or febrile disease were reported in 30% of the cases. The findings of this research suggest that syncope is a major antecedent symptom of exertional sudden death. An attack of syncope in young conditioned individuals should be followed by thorough medical surveillance, and strenuous exercise should be avoided until this procedure is completed. Sports and military officials have the obligation to promote awareness that strenuous exercise should not be performed in the presence of acute gastrointestinal symptoms or febrile illness.\r"

An upper respiratory tract infection was indicated by the report of any of the following symptoms; runny nose, sore throat, or cough. Using a multiple logistic regression model, the following factors were found to be associated with having one or more URTIs in the follow-up period: living alone (odds ratio = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.01, 5.09), running mileage (486-865 miles, odds ratio = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.01, 2.78; 866-1388 miles, odds ratio = 3.50, 95% CI = 1.52, 4.44; greater than 1388 miles, odds ratio = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.30, 3.68), body mass index greater than the 75th percentile (odds ratio = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.35, 0.94), and male gender (odds ratio = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.68). A significant interaction was found to exist between gender and alcohol use, with the association between alcohol use and upper respiratory tract infections being positive in males and negative in females. These results suggest that running dosage (mileage) is a significant risk factor for upper respiratory tract infections in this group of exercisers.\r"

All assessments other than muscular strength and endurance were based upon a symptom limited graded exercise test on a bicycle ergometer. Muscular strength and endurance were assessed on a Cybex II isokinetic dynamometer. Sixteen patients were assigned randomly to 8 wk of cycle training or HCT (N = 8 in each). Subjects assigned to cycle training exercised on bicycle ergometers. The HCT group exercised on a three-station circuit, completing three circuits per day. Each circuit consisted of three 20 s work intervals at each station with a 1:1 work:rest ratio. Results from the training groups were compared with results from eight patients who served as a nonexercising control group. Following training the peak VO2 was significantly increased in the training groups (20% and 11% for the cycle and HCT groups, respectively; P less than 0.05). For both training groups, the increase in peak VO2 was associated with increases in SV and Qc and a reduction in heart rate (HR) at submaximal levels of exercise (P less than 0.05). Only the HCT group demonstrated an increase in both muscular strength and endurance during knee and shoulder exercises (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that a program of HCT can elicit improvements in cardiovascular fitness and muscular strength and endurance in post-CABS patients.\r"

The level of SMR was expressed as an index; SMI = SMR/BMR, where SMR was measured in a respiration chamber while subjects were asleep and basal metabolic rate (BMR) was calculated with the equation from Harris and Benedict. Physical activity, calculated from average daily metabolic rate (ADMR) and BMR, was expressed as an index: PAI = ADMR/BMR, where ADMR was measured with doubly labeled water and BMR was calculated as indicated above. Individual values of SMI were 0.8-1.2. SMI was positively correlated with PAI (r = 0.85, P less than 0.001). Subjects with either a high or a low Quetelet Index were concentrated in the lower range of PAI compared with normal-weight subjects. In conclusion, subjects with an extremely low or high body weight generally show a lower than expected SMR associated with a low physical activity.\r"

Specific dependent variables examined were tendon breaking strength and rate of collagen formation. A puncture technique was used to induce injuries to both Achilles tendons of rats. Continuous ultrasound was administered to the left tendon for 4 min per treatment session at an intensity of 1.5 W.cm-2. Rats were sacrificed 2, 5, 9, 15, and 21 d following injury for measurement of tendon breaking strength and 3 and 5 d postinjury for analysis of collagen synthesis. Breaking strength was defined as the minimum force required to completely rupture the tendon. Collagen synthesis was indicated by the conversion of labeled proline to hydroxyproline. The breaking strengths of the treated tendons were significantly greater than strengths of the untreated tendons 5, 9, 15, and 21 d postinjury. Collagen synthesis was increased in the treated tendons compared with the untreated tendons 5 d postinjury. The results indicate that ultrasound treatment increases the rate of repair of injured Achilles tendons of rats. The results are also consistent with an association between increased collagen synthesis and greater breaking strength during tendon repair.\r"

  ".W": "Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation was determined in 46 sedentary young adult males who took part in ergocycle endurance training programs in two laboratories to assess whether mitochondrial DNA variants were associated with individual differences in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and its response to training. VO2max was obtained from a progressive ergocycle test to exhaustion. White blood cell mitochondrial DNA was characterized with the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique using 22 restriction enzymes and human mitochondrial DNA as a probe for hybridization. Multiple mitochondrial DNA variants were detected with 15 of the enzymes. Some subjects exhibited many RFLPs, while others showed no variation. These RFLPs (morphs) were generated by base substitutions located in gene regions coding for mitochondrial proteins as well as in the noncoding regions. Carriers of three mitochondrial DNA morphs, two in the subunit 5 of the NADH dehydrogenase gene and one in the tRNA for threonine, had a VO2max (ml.kg-1.min-1) in the untrained state significantly higher than noncarriers, while carriers of one mitochondrial DNA morph in subunit 2 of NADH dehydrogenase had a lower initial VO2max. Endurance training increased VO2max by a mean of 0.51 of O2, with individual differences ranging from gains of 0.06 to 1.03. After adjustment for training site and initial VO2max, a lower response was observed for three carriers of a variant in subunit 5 of the NADH dehydrogenase detected with HincII (mean gain of 0.28 I; P less than 0.05). These results suggest that sequence variation in mitochondrial DNA may contribute to individual difference in VO2max and its response to training.\r"

In the first part of the study, physiologic responses during incremental exercise on the variable-resistance rowing ergometer were compared in 16 untrained female subjects (U), 17 collegiate female rowers (C), and 21 elite oarswomen (E). Minute ventilation (VE) and frequency of respiration (fR) were examined on a log scale as their relationship with oxygen consumption (VO2) was exponential. The slopes for log VE/VO2 were similar for collegiate (0.65 +/- 0.02) and elite (0.59 +/- 0.01) rowers, but the slope was significantly higher for the untrained (0.87 +/- 0.01) subjects (P less than 0.001). Elite rowers utilized a higher tidal volume (VT) response per VO2 (0.68 +/- 0.04 vs 0.30 +/- 0.05; P = 0.01) and lower log fR response per VO2 (0.27 +/- 0.02 vs 0.50 +/- 0.03; P = 0.01) compared with collegiate rowers. The ratio of fR/strokes per minute (SPM) averaged 1.5 in E athletes but varied in the U and C groups. In the second part of the study, pattern and timing of respiration were recording using an inspiratory pneumotachygraph, analyzed, and compared with specific phases of the rowing stroke in ten untrained subjects and nine elite rowers. The ratio of inspiratory time (T1)/total respiratory time (TTOT) decreased during the drive phase and increased during the recovery phase in both untrained subjects and elite rowers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The HV session involved the use of 8-12 repetition maximum (RM) loads performed to exhaustion with 60 s rest intervals between sets, while the LV session involved the use of 1-5RM loads with 3 min rest intervals between sets. Fasting blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein immediately before and after exercise as well as 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise. Following adjustment for changes in plasma volume, significant changes were only found following the HV session. These included increases in HDL-C (11%) and HDL3-C (12%) 24 h post-exercise. Modifications in HDL-C were significantly different from both the LV and control sessions. In contrast, triglycerides and LCAT were significantly depressed 24 h post-exercise following the HV session when compared with immediate post-exercise values. There were no significant changes in either total cholesterol or HDL2-C at any time. The results of this study suggest that the potential of resistance exercise to affect acute modifications in the lipoprotein profile resides in the volume of exercise performed.\r"

The relationship between body mass (M) and oxygen uptake (VO2) was evaluated by deriving the exponent b in the equation VO2 = a.Mb. Thus, if b = 1, the oxygen uptake increases in proportion to body mass and oxygen uptake per kg is independent of body mass; if b less than 1, than the oxygen uptake per kg is inversely related to body mass. The exponent b was found to be less than unity for all groups for both submaximal (b = 0.76, s = 0.06) and maximal oxygen uptake (b = 0.71, s = 0.05). These results indicate that neither submaximal nor maximal oxygen uptake increases in proportion to body mass during running. The relationship between submaximal oxygen uptake and body mass observed in this study may explain why the oxygen uptake per kg of body mass has been found to be higher for children than for adults.\r"

Following each diet treatment and immediately prior to the fatiguing cycle ergometer ride, cyclists completed a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. The POMS yields measures of tension (T), depression (D), anger (A), vigor (V), fatigue (F), and confusion (C), as well as providing a total mood score (TMS). Results indicated that subjects on LCHO had significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater T, D, A, and TMS and less V compared with MCHO and HCHO. There were no significant differences between MCHO and HCHO. In the present study, LCHO in conjunction with training and exercise adversely affected the mood state of trained female cyclists as compared with MCHO and HCHO diets.\r"

  ".W": "Modern athletic footwear provides remarkable plantar comfort when walking, running, or jumping. However, when injurious plantar loads elicit negligible perceived plantar discomfort, a perceptual illusion is created whereby perceived impact is lower than actual impact, which results in inadequate impact-moderating behavior and consequent injury. The objective of this study was to examine how plantar tactile (mechanical) events affect perceived plantar discomfort. Also, we evaluated the feasibility of a footwear safety standard we propose, which requires elimination of the above illusion. Twenty subjects gave numerical estimates of plantar discomfort produced by simulated locomotion (concurrent vertical (0.1-0.7 kg.cm-2) and horizontal (0.1-0.9 kg.cm-2) plantar loads), with the foot supported by either a smooth rigid surface or a rigid surface with 2 mm high rigid irregularities. Vertical or horizontal load alone evoked no discomfort (P greater than 0.05), whereas together, discomfort emanated from loads as low as 0.4 kg.cm-2. Irregularities heightened discomfort by a factor of 1.89. This suggests that the proposed safety standard is feasible, since compliance could be achieved simply by adding surface irregularities to insoles and by other changes that heighten localized plantar loads. However, until this standard is adhered to, it might be more appropriate to classify athletic footwear as \"safety hazards\" rather than \"protective devices\".\r"

The present study investigated the segmental origin of this directionally specific difference by examining the linear momentum of the shank, thigh, and head-arm-trunk segments for ten healthy young adults at slow, natural, and fast self-selected speeds. Findings indicated that the head-arm-trunk was the major contributor to the horizontal maximum linear momentum of the CM and accounted for the relative invariance in its magnitude. In contrast, the thigh was the major contributor to the vertical maximum linear momentum of the CM and was responsible for the progressive increase in its magnitude across the range of speeds. Moreover, the compatibility between the motions of the head-arm-trunk and of the shank in their general profile and peak magnitudes further suggested that a simplifying strategy may have been employed to reduce the overall number of degrees of freedom associated with the sit-to-stand movement.\r"

Six exercise sets, composed of the combinations of activation force (20,50, and 100 N) and angular velocity (45 and 135 degrees.s-1), were randomly assigned on each of two occasions, completed within a 10-d period. Although peak torques were not affected by the activation force, average torques, eccentric torques at mid-range (50 degrees knee flexion), and torques during the initial portion of each muscle action (80 degrees knee flexion during concentric muscle actions and 20 degrees flexion during eccentric actions) increased as the activation force increased. The effect of the activation force tended to be more pronounced during eccentric than during concentric muscle actions, and at the faster angular velocity. Comparisons of torques should be based on similar test protocols, including activation force.\r"

Seven male and two female members of the Wheaton College varsity cross country team served as subjects. Maximal measures included oxygen consumption (VO2max), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate (HRmax), and lactic acid (HLA). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed treadmill running to elicit higher VO2max and HRmax than both water tests (P less than 0.05). VO2max was also greater for SWR than for DWR (P less than 0.05). VO2max values for SWR and DWR were 90.3% and 73.5% of TMR, respectively. HRmax for SWR and DWR were 88.6% and 86% of TMR, respectively. RER and HLA did not differ among tests. These data suggest that shallow water running is capable of eliciting metabolic responses comparable to treadmill running. Shallow water running elicits higher metabolic responses than deep water running.\r"

  ".W": "Seven males (age = 20.4 +/- 0.3 yr) each performed a total of eight exhaustive exercise bouts (four at 60 rpm and four at 100 rpm) in order to determine the influence of pedaling frequency on the parameters of the power-duration relationship for high-intensity cycle ergometry. The power-endurance time data for each subject at each rpm were fit by nonlinear regression to extract parameters of the hyperbolic: (P - theta PA). t = W', where P = power output, t = time to exhaustion, and theta PA and W' are constants. theta PA (the power asymptote, in watts (W] reflects an inherent characteristic of aerobic energy production during exercise, above which only a finite amount of work (W', in joules) can be performed, regardless of the rate at which the work is performed. theta PA at 60 rpm (235 +/- 8 W) was significantly (15.9 +/- 4.5%, P less than 0.05) greater than theta PA at 100 rpm (204 +/- 11 W), thus confirming our hypothesis that endurance would be compromised while cycling at the higher pedaling frequency. In contrast, W' was not significantly (P greater than 0.05) affected by cadence (16.8 +/- 1.7 kJ at 60 rpm vs 18.9 +/- 2.2 kJ at 100 rpm). Our data are consistent with the implications of previous investigations which demonstrated a greater cardiorespiratory and blood/muscle lactate response during constant-power exercise while cycling at high vs low rpm and indicate that the theoretical maximum sustainable power (i.e., theta PA) during cycle ergometry in untrained males is greater at 60 rpm than at 100 rpm.\r"

Previous research has demonstrated the validity of anthropometric methods for this purpose, but little research has examined the validity of bioelectrical impedance (BIA) measurements. Comparisons between BIA systems has received limited attention. With these two objectives, we compared the prediction of minimal weight (MW) among 57 interscholastic wrestlers using three anthropometric methods (skinfolds (SF) and two skeletal dimensions equations) and three BIA systems (Berkeley Medical Research (BMR), RJL, and Valhalla (VAL]. All methods showed high correlations (r values greater than 0.92) with hydrostatic weighting (HW) and between methods (r values greater than 0.90). The standard errors of estimate (SEE) were relatively small for all methods, especially for SF and the three BIA systems (SEE less than 0.70 kg). The total errors of prediction (E) for RJL and VAL (E = 4.4 and 3.9 kg) were significantly larger than observed nonsignificant BMR and SF values (E = 2.3 and 1.8 kg, respectively). Significant mean differences were observed between HW, RJL, VAL, and the two skeletal dimensions equations, but nonsignificant differences were observed between HW, BMR, and SF. BMR differed significantly from the RJL and VAL systems. The results suggest that RJL and VAL have potential application for this subpopulation. Prediction equation refinement with the addition of selected anthropometric measurement or moderating variables may enhance their utility. However, within the scope of our study, SF and BMR BIA appear to be the most valid methods for determining MW in interscholastic wrestlers.\r"

Eighty-two wrestlers (X age +/- SD = 16.54 +/- 1.05 yr) volunteered to be assessed via anthropometry and underwater weighing, with percent body fat calculated from body density (BD) using both the conversion constants of Lohman [percent body fat = [5.03/BD) - 4.59) x 100] and Brozek [percent body fat = [4.57/BD) - 4.142) x 100]. In addition, five head coaches, who had between 5 and 24 yr of experience, were asked to estimate within 1 lb the MWW for each of their athletes. The validity of four selected anthropometric equations and the coaches' estimates were compared with the actual MWW from underwater weighing by examining the constant error (CE), r, SEE, and total error (TE) values. The results indicated that the skinfold equation (EQ1) of Lohman provided the most accurate estimates of MWW (TE = 1.90-2.09 kg) and is therefore recommended over the subjective estimates of high school coaches.\r"

Ergometer data were analyzed and combined with kinematic data and surface electromyography. Of all power and torque parameters investigated, only maximal power output was independent of load (mean peak value 375 W, one-sided). Mean power output is suggested to be a useful indicator for anaerobic power production, but test conditions concerned speed in relation to handrim diameter should be specified. The relevance of the \"mechanical constraint principle\" for handrim propulsion is discussed. Within one cycle, power and torque curves showed a negative deflection at the beginning and a valley approximately halfway through the push phase. The relation of these phenomena to kinematic parameters and muscle activity is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Immunosuppression is the most effective treatment for patients with aplastic anemia, except for bone marrow transplantation. The best results are achieved with antilymphocyte globulin or cyclosporine. Patients have been treated successfully with a combination of both agents, but there has been no controlled evaluation of its efficacy. We conducted a randomized, multicenter trial in 84 patients not eligible for bone marrow transplantation, comparing treatment with antilymphocyte globulin and methylprednisolone (41 patients--the control group) with antilymphocyte globulin, methylprednisolone, and cyclosporine (43 patients--the cyclosporine group). RESULTS. At three months significantly more patients in the cyclosporine group had a complete or partial remission in response to treatment than did patients in the control group (65 percent vs. 39 percent, P less than 0.03); this difference was confirmed at six months (70 percent vs. 46 percent, P less than 0.05). The superior results of the regimen including cyclosporine were most evident in the patients with severe or very severe aplastic anemia, whose response rate at six months was 65 percent, as compared with 31 percent of such patients in the control group (P less than 0.02). Granulocyte and hemoglobin levels became normal in most patients who responded, but platelet counts continued to be subnormal in 61 percent of the patients. Ten of 52 patients with responses (3 in the cyclosporine group and 7 in the control group) relapsed 4 to 37 months after treatment. The actuarial survival of all patients at 41 months is 64 percent in the cyclosporine group and 58 percent in the control group (P = 0.16); among the patients with severe or very severe disease, survival is 80 percent and 44 percent, respectively (P = 0.077). Cyclosporine had substantial but reversible side effects. CONCLUSIONS. Immunosuppressive treatment of aplastic anemia with antilymphocyte globulin, methylprednisolone, and cyclosporine appears to be more effective than a regimen of antilymphocyte globulin and methylprednisolone without cyclosporine and may thus represent a treatment of choice for patients who are not eligible for bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The kidney is important in blood-pressure regulation, but its role in the development of essential hypertension is still subject to debate. We compared renal hemodynamics, measured in terms of the clearance of para-aminohippuric acid and inulin, and the characteristics of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in three groups of normotensive subjects at different degrees of risk for hypertension: 41 subjects with two normotensive parents, 52 with one normotensive and one hypertensive parent, and 61 with two hypertensive parents. The subjects ranged in age from 7 to 32 years. RESULTS. The mean renal blood flow was lower in the subjects with two hypertensive parents than in those with two normotensive parents (mean difference [+/- SE], 198 +/- 61 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; P = 0.002). Moreover, both the filtration fraction and renal vascular resistance were higher in the subjects with two hypertensive parents (filtration fraction: mean difference, 3.0 +/- 1.1 percentage points; P = 0.006; renal vascular resistance: mean difference, 2.7 +/- 0.8 mm Hg per deciliter per minute per 1.73 m2; P = 0.006). The subjects with two hypertensive parents had lower plasma concentrations of renin (mean difference, 3.3 +/- 1.6 mU per liter; P = 0.03) and aldosterone (mean difference, 111 +/- 36 pmol per liter; P = 0.003) than those with two normotensive parents. The differences could not be explained by the small differences in blood pressure between the groups. The values in the subjects with one hypertensive and one normotensive parent fell between those for the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Renal vasoconstriction is increased and renin and aldosterone secretion is decreased in young persons at risk for hypertension. These findings support the hypothesis that alterations in renal hemodynamics occur at an early stage in the development of familial hypertension.\r"

Surgical repair of muscular ventricular septal defects, particularly those associated with complex heart lesions carries a higher risk of reoperation and death than the repair of membranous defects. Closing a muscular defect through an incision in the systemic ventricle may cause late ventricular dysfunction. In a collaborative approach to this problem, we undertook preoperative transcatheter closure of muscular ventricular septal defects remote from the atrioventricular and semilunar valves, followed by the surgical repair of associated conditions. METHODS. In 12 patients selected jointly by a cardiologist and a cardiac surgeon, we attempted preoperative transcatheter umbrella closure of 21 defects. Half the patients had associated complex heart lesions; the others had had pulmonary-artery banding to reduce the amount of left-to-right shunting. Half had severe ventricular septal deficiency. RESULTS. All 21 defects were successfully closed without major complications. Subsequent cardiac surgery for associated conditions in 11 of the 12 patients resulted in a mean pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio of 1.1, indicating minimal residual left-to-right shunting; 1 patient awaited surgical repair. No deaths, reoperations, or late complications have occurred after a follow-up of 7 to 20 months. CONCLUSIONS. A collaborative approach using transcatheter closure followed by the surgical repair of associated cardiac lesions may decrease rates of operative mortality, reoperation, and left ventricular dysfunction in patients with muscular ventricular septal defects.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe is an X-linked disorder whose clinical manifestations include congenital cataracts, mental retardation, and renal tubular dysfunction. We investigated growth, renal function, and serum chemistry values in patients with the oculocerebrorenal syndrome to determine the natural history of the disorder and its heterogeneity with respect to these characteristics. METHODS. Twenty-three patients with the oculocerebrorenal syndrome, ranging in age from 4 months to 31 years, were examined. Height was compared with bone age. Renal function was assessed by measurements of proteinuria, urinary volume, and fractional excretions of potassium, phosphate, carnitine, and amino acids. Creatinine clearance was determined as a measure of glomerular function. RESULTS. In the oculocerebrorenal syndrome, linear growth decreases after one year of age; bone age lies between chronologic age and height age. Renal dysfunction occurs in the first year of life, characterized by proteinuria (mean [+/- SD], 1.38 +/- 0.77 g of urinary protein per square meter of body-surface area per day; normal, less than or equal to 0.10), generalized aminoaciduria (mean, 686 +/- 505 mumol of urinary amino acid per kilogram of body weight per day; normal, 94 +/- 45), carnitine wasting (mean fractional excretion, 0.10 +/- 0.05; normal, 0.03 +/- 0.01), and phosphaturia progressing into the third decade. Urinary wasting of individual amino acids is milder than in cystinosis, and branched-chain amino acids are relatively spared. Reciprocal serum creatinine levels fall linearly with age, predicting renal failure in the fourth decade. Concentrations of the muscle enzymes creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as of total serum protein, serum alpha 2-globulin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are elevated. CONCLUSIONS. Renal glomerular deterioration is slowly progressive in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome. Renal tubular dysfunction begins early and persists; most patients require alkalinization therapy, and many benefit from supplemental potassium, phosphate, calcium, or carnitine. Serum enzyme elevations suggest muscle involvement in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although even in the elderly most falls are not associated with fractures, over 90 percent of hip fractures are the result of a fall. Few studies have assessed whether the risk factors for falls are also important risk factors for hip fracture. METHODS. To examine the importance of risk factors for falls in the epidemiology of hip fracture, we performed a case-control study of 174 women (median age, 80 years) admitted with a first hip fracture to 1 of 30 hospitals in New York and Philadelphia. Controls, matched to the case patients according to age and hospital, were selected from general surgical and orthopedic surgical hospital services. Information was obtained by direct interview. RESULTS. As measured by the odds ratio, increased risks for hip fracture were associated with lower-limb dysfunction (odds ratio = 1.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.8), visual impairment (odds ratio = 5.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 13.9), previous stroke (odds ratio = 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 4.0), Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 9.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 76.1), and use of long-acting barbiturates (odds ratio = 5.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 45.0). Of the controls, 44 (25 percent) had had a recent fall. The case patients were more likely than these controls to have fallen from a standing height or higher (odds ratio = 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.7). Of those with hip fracture the younger patients (less than 75 years old) were more likely than the older ones (greater than or equal to 75 years old) to have fallen on a hard surface (odds ratio = 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS. A number of factors that have been identified as risk factors for falls are also associated with hip fracture, including lower-limb dysfunction, neurologic conditions, barbiturate use, and visual impairment. Given the prevalence of these problems among the elderly, who are at highest risk, programs to prevent hip fracture should include measures to prevent falls in addition to measures to slow bone loss.\r"

Two Drosophila POU-domain proteins, I-POU and Cf1-a, are coexpressed in overlapping subsets of neurons during development. Because I-POU lacks two basic residues in the N terminus of its homeodomain, it cannot bind DNA, but it does form a stable heterodimeric complex with Cf1-a, preventing Cf1-a from binding to DNA recognition elements and from transactivating the dopa-decarboxylase gene. The inhibition by I-POU provides a potential strategy by which the activation of genes in development is controlled by a homeodomain-containing protein that does not bind DNA.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. On the basis of the homology between these receptors, three different dopamine receptors (D1, D2, D3) have been cloned. Dopamine receptors are primary targets for drugs used in the treatment of psychomotor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. In the management of socially withdrawn and treatment-resistant schizophrenics, clozapine is one of the most favoured antipsychotics because it does not cause tardive dyskinesia. Clozapine, however, has dissociation constants for binding to D2 and D3 that are 4 to 30 times the therapeutic free concentration of clozapine in plasma water. This observation suggests the existence of other types of dopamine receptors which are more sensitive to clozapine. Here we report the cloning of a gene that encodes such a receptor (D4). The D4 receptor gene has high homology to the human dopamine D2 and D3 receptor genes. The pharmacological characteristics of this receptor resembles that of the D2 and D3 receptors, but its affinity for clozapine is one order of magnitude higher. Recognition and characterization of this clozapine neuroleptic site may prove useful in the design of new types of drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine receptors belong to a superfamily of receptors that exert their biological effects through guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins. Two main dopamine receptor subtypes have been identified, D1 and D2, which differ in their pharmacological and biochemical characteristics. D1 stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity, whereas D2 inhibits it. Both receptors are primary targets for drugs used to treat many psychomotor diseases, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Whereas the dopamine D1 receptor has been cloned, biochemical and behavioural data indicate that dopamine D1-like receptors exist which either are not linked to adenylyl cyclase or display different pharmacological activities. We report here the cloning of a gene encoding a 477-amino-acid protein with strong homology to the cloned D1 receptor. The receptor, called D5, binds drugs with a pharmacological profile similar to that of the cloned D1 receptor, but displays a 10-fold higher affinity for the endogenous agonist, dopamine. As with D1, the dopamine D5 receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses reveal that the receptor is neuron-specific, localized primarily within limbic regions of the brain; no messenger RNA was detected in kidney, liver, heart or parathyroid gland. The existence of a dopamine D1-like receptor with these characteristics had not been predicted and may represent an alternative pathway for dopamine-mediated events and regulation of D2 receptor activity.\r"

The crystal structures of HLA-A2 and HLA-Aw68 reveal that peptide-antigen forms an integral part of the HLA structure, being retained in a prominent groove even after purification and crystallization. Here we report that the heavy chain and beta 2-microglobulin of HLA-A2, after separation and fractionation in denaturants, reassemble efficiently under renaturing conditions only in the presence of MHC-restricted peptides. A complex of heavy chain, beta 2-microglobulin, and viral peptide in the ratio 1:1:1 is formed in up to 46% yield. Reconstitution is not stimulated by either of two peptides not restricted to HLA-A2. The reconstituted complex of HLA-A2 and the influenza virus (B/Lee/40) nucleoprotein peptide, Np (85-94), crystallizes under conditions previously used to crystallize HLA-A2. Peptide-linked folding and assembly suggests mechanisms for the unusual capacity of HLA to bind many peptides of diverse sequence.\r"

  ".W": "Most of the transcriptional effects of cyclic AMP are mediated by the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). After activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, the catalytic subunits of this enzyme apparently mediate the phosphorylation and activation of CREB. As cAMP serves as a mitogenic signal for anterior pituitary somatotrophic cells, we investigated whether CREB similarly regulates proliferation of these cells. We prepared transgenic mice expressing a transcriptionally inactive mutant of CREB (CREBM1), which cannot be phosphorylated, in cells of the anterior pituitary. If CREB activity is required for proliferation, the overexpressed mutant protein would effectively compete with wild-type CREB activity and thereby block the response to cAMP. As predicted, the CREBM1 transgenic mice exhibited a dwarf phenotype with atrophied pituitary glands markedly deficient in somatotroph but not other cell types. We conclude that transcriptional activation of CREB is necessary for the normal development of a highly restricted cell type, and that environmental cues, possibly provided by the hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing factor, are necessary for population of the pituitary by somatotrophic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) genome is regulated in part by cellular factors and is stimulated by activation of latently infected T cells. T-cell activation also correlates with the induction of the factor NF-kappa B which binds to two adjacent sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. This factor consists of two DNA-binding subunits of relative molecular mass 50,000 (50K) associated with two 65K subunits. It is located in the nucleus in mature B cells, but is present in other cell types as an inactive cytoplasmic complex. External stimuli, including those that activate T cells, result in nuclear translocation of active NF-kappa B. The cloning of the complementary DNA for the 50K subunit helped to identify an exclusively cytoplasmic 105K precursor (p105) (V.B., P.K. and A.I., manuscript submitted). The expression of active NF-kappa B might therefore also be regulated by the extent of processing of p105. Because HIV-1 requires active NF-kappa B for efficient transcription, we tested the effect of HIV-1 infection on the processing of the human 105K precursor. We show here that the HIV-1 protease can process p105 and increases levels of active nuclear NF-kappa B complex.\r"

The advent of stable immobile nucleic acid branched junctions makes DNA a good candidate for building frameworks to which proteins or other functional molecules can be attached and thereby juxtaposed. The addition of single-stranded 'sticky' ends to branched DNA molecules converts them into macromolecular valence clusters that can be ligated together. The edges of these frameworks are double-helical DNA, and the vertices correspond to the branch points of junctions. Here, we report the construction from DNA of a covalently closed cube-like molecular complex containing twelve equal-length double-helical edges arranged about eight vertices. Each of the six 'faces' of the object is a single-stranded cyclic molecule, doubly catenated to four neighbouring strands, and each vertex is connected by an edge to three others. Each edge contains a unique restriction site for analytical purposes. This is the first construction of a closed polyhedral object from DNA.\r"

Among the more promising approaches would be cholecystokinin agonists, small molecules that mimic ketoacids, agonists to corticotropin-releasing hormone, beta-3 agonists, antagonists to opioid peptides, antagonists to neuropeptide Y, glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, and growth hormone agonists. Since a number of mechanisms can influence body fat and nutrient partitioning, it is likely that optimal therapy will involve use of more than one pharmacologic agent.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the influence of the intensity of coagulation spots on retinal function and the clinical course after panretinal argon laser photocoagulation in diabetic retinopathy, we conducted a prospective study in 24 eyes of 12 diabetics. One eye was treated with moderate spots (average: 300 mW), the fellow eye was coagulated with intense spots (average: 600 mW). The spot size was identical in both eyes. Subjective parameters (visual acuity, perimetry), as well as objective functions (ERG, EOG) and the clinical course, were studied preoperatively and on a regular base with a follow-up of 12 months. Visual acuity and fundus findings deteriorated less often in eyes coagulated with intense spots. Visual field loss, however, was more prevalent in eyes treated with intense spots. Early treatment complications only occurred with high-energy coagulation. For this reason, high-energy spots should not be used even though they might be indicated theoretically.\r"

High wattage of the Nd:YAG laser provides destructive pressure that creates fissures which act as the light traps of a black body simulator for efficient cw argon laser energy conversion to pressure and kinetic energy. Within the fissure the deposited cw argon laser energy is directed by gradients toward the tissue surface so that deepening troughs or tunnels are formed by expelling tissue debris.\r"

The basic lesion might be considered an abortive vascular system which arborizes among normal structures. Intrinsic hemorrhage expands portions of the small-caliber network into large blood cysts, prompting clinical recognition. While major hemorrhage led to early surgery in 12 cases, long pretreatment intervals could be analyzed in 17 others. Twelve patients had second hemorrhages of varied magnitude, from 2 weeks to 15 years after initial recognition; five patients did not in an average of 6.8 years. Some blood cysts contracted spontaneously. Among 23 operated cases, 12 patients had major new bleeds from 4 days to 12 years after initial surgery; 11 patients did not in an average of 4.2 years. Poor final visual acuity was associated with multiple surgeries. The authors advocate conservatism in surgical case selection and in operative dissection.\r"

The authors recently examined a 78-year-old man with a hidradenoma papilliferum at the margin of the upper eyelid. While the tumor was located in the dermis, serial sections showed a connection to the epidermis and neoplastic cells partially replacing a gland of Moll. There were glandular structures with luminal cells that showed apical decapitation-type secretion, indicating the apocrine origin of the tumor. The luminal cells also contained granules that stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and were diastase resistant. Results of examination of the duct-forming cells by transmission electron microscopy showed adluminal villi, focal decapitation secretion, luminal cytoplasmic debris, and electron-dense cytoplasmic secretory granules. Because the apocrine glands of Moll are localized adjacent to the eyelid cilia, hidradenoma papilliferum and other tumors of apocrine origin should be considered in the clinical setting of a mass at the eyelid margin.\r"

Three of seven cases that were tested harbored cells that stained with monoclonal antibodies against different components of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); one of the biopsies also contained cells that bore cytomegalovirus antigens. Immunoglobulin-gene rearrangements, but not T-cell receptor rearrangements, were demonstrated in one of two Sjogren's lacrimal gland biopsies tested. The authors conclude that the destruction of the tubuloacinar architecture of lacrimal gland tissue in Sjogren's syndrome appears secondary to lymphoproliferation of B cells and T-helper cells, probably derived from primary lymphoid follicles. Productive infection of lacrimal gland tissue with EBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of the syndrome in selective cases.\r"

Results of parotid biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid, and serologic analyses showed abnormalities that were consistent with the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. Although the patient had optic disc pallor on initial evaluation, her color vision and acuity improved with immunosuppressive therapy, as did her other neurologic symptoms. The authors believe this represents the first reported case of optic neuropathy and CNS disease associated with primary Sjogren's syndrome in the pediatric population. The possibility of improvement in visual function with early institution of immunosuppressive therapy makes prompt diagnosis essential.\r"

The initial prevalence of posterior vitreous detachment was 0% (none of 15 eyes) in group 1, 6% (three of 50 eyes) in group 2, and 27% (67 of 245 eyes) in group 3. During the study, all 15 eyes in group 1 and all 43 eyes in group 2 for which data were obtained progressed to fully developed macular holes without the occurrence of posterior vitreous detachment. The findings strongly suggested that most idiopathic macular holes develop in the absence of posterior vitreous detachment and that the pathogenesis of the holes may be independent of the occurrence of posterior vitreous detachment.\r"

None of the new vessels organized into an exudative fibrovascular scar. Visual acuity was improved or unchanged during the entire follow-up period in 12 (86%) eyes and deteriorated in 2 (14%). Nine patients (75%) were 80 years of age or older; three (25%) were between 65 and 70 years of age. These observations suggested that SRNV showing minimal fluorescein leakage, particularly when it occurs in patients older than 80 years, do not require photocoagulation because they are usually self-limited.\r"

The authors have developed a method to circumvent this problem and report light and electron microscopic histopathology and immunocytochemistry of an unusual retina from a 76-year-old man with multiplex RP. The retina shows loss of photoreceptors throughout (particularly rods), shortened foveal cone outer segments, and displaced photoreceptors in rosettes and tubules, an atypical pattern for RP. Antigenicity was recovered in this retina by treatment with sodium borohydride, and 17 antigens normally found in retina are present with expected distribution, although many cells have abnormal morphology. Most cone outer segments are immunoreactive with anti-blue but not anti-red/green cone opsin, whereas blue cone sensitivity is preferentially lost in many cases of RP. Psychophysical testing of the patient's sister, who has the same retinal disease, showed reduced rod and red/green cone sensitivities. This was consistent with the diminished numbers and size of rods and red/green cones found by immunocytochemistry in her brother's retina. The sister did not show blue cone hypersensitivity characteristic of a recently described retinal degeneration known as the \"enhanced S cone syndrome.\"\r"

Diagnostic vitrectomy revealed necrotic retinal cells containing intranuclear inclusions visible with light microscopy. On electron microscopy, viral particles consistent with a herpes family virus were detected. Culture of the vitrectomy specimen showed herpes simplex, type 1 (HSV 1) and rising convalescent serum ELISA titers to HSV 1 confirmed a recent infection. This case of ARN is unusual for its severity, early macular involvement, and development of exudative retinal detachment. In addition, it represents one of the few reported cases in which HSV 1 has been confirmed by both vitreous culture and serum titers as the etiologic agent. A review of the literature suggests that posterior segment inflammatory conditions secondary to HSV 1 can be associated with exudative retinal detachment, a clinical finding that may help differentiate such conditions from other infectious causes of chorioretinitis.\r"

Results indicated that during active uveitis from many causes, T-helper cells predominated in the vitreous and retinochoroidal biopsies. Monocytes were not prominent constituents except in several cases of granulomatous etiology (e.g., syphilis and acute retinal necrosis). Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens were increased on the retinal vascular endothelium, implicating an important role for these cells in the local cellular immune response. These results may be of great importance in our understanding of uveitis, as well as being helpful in categorizing posterior uveitis, permitting appropriate therapy to be given.\r"

Abnormal Doppler shifts were demonstrated within 39 neoplastic lesions studied, but Doppler shifts could not be detected in three tumor-simulating lesions. In a group of 12 choroidal melanomas studied after radiation therapy, lower Doppler shifts were seen compared with a group of 28 tumors before therapy. This change in Doppler shift may reflect the decreased vascular supply of the tumor. Color Doppler imaging may be of value as an additional useful tool in the diagnosis and management of intraocular tumors.\r"

  ".W": "A review of 1019 patients with posterior uveal melanomas, who were treated with episcleral plaque radiotherapy between April 1976 and December 1987, showed that 59 (6%) of these patients have thus far required enucleation of the affected eye. The most common clinical reasons for enucleation were tumor regrowth (51%) and neovascular glaucoma (31%). These irradiated melanomas were of mixed cell type in 40 cases (68%), spindle in 10 cases (17%), totally necrotic in 7 cases (12%), and epithelioid in 2 cases (3%). Some degree of tumor necrosis was seen in all cases. Overall, the median number of mitoses per 40 high-power fields in these irradiated tumors was 0. Most (64%) of the tumors had no identifiable mitosis in 40 high-power fields. A three-way simultaneous comparison of the following groups was made: irradiated eyes enucleated for tumor regrowth, irradiated eyes enucleated for neovascular glaucoma, and a matched group of nonirradiated posterior uveal melanomas. This comparison showed that the largest tumor dimension was significantly greater in the irradiated eyes enucleated for tumor regrowth than in the other two groups. Mitotic activity was significantly higher in the irradiated tumor regrowth and nonirradiated groups than in the irradiated neovascular group. There was no significant difference among the three groups in an analysis of height. The results suggested that mitotic activity may exist after plaque radiotherapy, especially when there is clinical evidence of tumor regrowth.\r"

Polydimethylsiloxane oil, 5000 cps, caused an increased corneal endothelial permeability to inulin and dextran at 24, 96, and 168 hours after placement into the eye. Intraocular pressures were slightly elevated in the experimental eyes, compared with contralateral controls, at 24 and 144 hours after infusion. The effects of five other oils on corneal endothelial permeability were examined 168 hours after infusion. All oils increased permeability and caused thinning of endothelial cells, together with the appearance of a retrocorneal membrane, except Dow Corning Medical Fluid 360. The results indicated that contact of most silicone oils with corneal endothelium rapidly induces physiologic and morphologic changes.\r"

They also assessed the release of tryptase into the tear fluid after provoking the conjunctiva with (7) allergens, (8) compound 48/80, and (9) rubbing. Tryptase levels were elevated in tears of patients with active ocular allergy and also increased after provoking the conjunctiva with allergens in atopic subjects and with compound 48/80 and rubbing in nonatopic subjects. Tryptase levels in tear fluid may prove useful as a clinical indicator of mast cell involvement in ocular allergic disorders. In provocation experiments, tryptase levels may be used to evaluate and compare different mast cell stabilizing agents.\r"

The electrolyte content of agar media required for toxin production was first investigated. Alpha-lysin was found to be produced by all isolates of S. aureus colonizing lids of normal controls and patients with blepharitis, but by none of 281 CNS isolates. A new toxin was identified, having low molecular weight (5 kd), produced by one CNS strain isolated from a blepharitic lid. It was produced on basic nutrient agar that lacked sodium but contained glucose, which inhibited production of alpha-lysin. It hemolyzed rabbit and sheep erythrocytes and, surprisingly, was neutralized by polyclonal antiserum to alpha-lysin. This may explain occasional reports of alpha-lysin production by CNS. The overall results do not support a hypothesis of hemolytic toxin production by staphylococci as a general cause of blepharitis.\r"

Most of the recipients under observation (91%) were well matched for HLA-DR. Of 438 recipients, 158 (36%) completed a 3-year follow-up. Three factors were associated with endothelial allograft reactions: 2 to 4+ corneal vascularization (relative risk, 2.2; P = 0.0006), two mismatched antigens at either the HLA-A or HLA-B locus (relative risk, 2.1; P = 0.0009), and recipient wound size of 8 mm or greater (relative risk, 1.5; P = 0.05). Unexpectedly, a strong association between endothelial allograft reactions and HLA-A or HLA-B incompatibility was found in low-risk recipients defined as unvascularized recipients of a small graft (relative risk, 3.2; P = 0.004). A larger sample size is required to determine if HLA matching offers a solution for recipients with corneal vascularization.\r"

  ".W": "The analgesic and adverse effects of intrathecal methadone 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg were assessed and compared with intrathecal morphine 0.5 mg. The study was conducted on 38 patients who underwent total knee or hip replacement surgery. The intrathecal opioid was administered at the end of surgery and assessments began 1 h thereafter and continued for 24 h. Pain measurements, supplementary analgesia requirements, and adverse effects were recorded. Intrathecal morphine 0.5 mg provided effective and prolonged analgesia. Intrathecal methadone 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg produced good analgesia of 4 h duration. Thereafter the median pain scores with intrathecal methadone were consistently higher (worse) than those with intrathecal morphine (P less than 0.05). The time to the onset of discomfort severe enough to require supplemental morphine was longer after intrathecal morphine than following methadone (15 h with morphine 0.5 mg; 6.25 h, 6.5 h and 6 h with methadone 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg respectively: P less than 0.05). Central nervous system depression manifesting as respiratory depression, hypotension, and excessive drowsiness occurred in 3 of 8 patients injected with methadone 20 mg intrathecally. Generalized pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention were common and equally distributed among the treatment groups. We conclude that both intrathecal morphine 0.5 mg and methadone 5, 10, and 20 mg provide excellent analgesia but that morphine has a more prolonged effect. Methadone 20 mg produced unacceptable side effects. Clinical evidence for rostral spread of methadone within the CSF, as indicated by facial itching and excessive drowsiness, was less apparent with 5 mg than with 10 and 20 mg. Various explanations for the observed differences between the drugs are discussed.\r"

Variation in spinal antinociceptive activity is also postulated to explain in part the large variability in postoperative opioid analgesic requirements. In this study, spinal noradrenergic and opioid activity, as reflected by the CSF concentrations of norepinephrine and immunoreactive enkephalins (total enkephalin-containing peptides), was determined in 58 women prior to surgery. The CSF concentration of these substances did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women. CSF norepinephrine tended to be greater in pregnant women who had experienced painful labor than in those who had not (1240 +/- 300 vs. 570 +/- 160 pmol/l; P = 0.056) and these women self-administered less morphine following cesarean section than those without labor pain (64 +/- 4 vs. 86 +/- 7 mg/24 h; P less than 0.01). However, CSF concentration of norepinephrine or immunoreactive enkephalins did not correlate with postoperative morphine use. These results suggest that spinal immunoreactive enkephalin and noradrenergic activity are not increased during pregnancy. However, pain may activate spinal noradrenergic pathways affecting pain sensation.\r"

We observed that chlorimipramine and amitriptyline, two tricyclic antidepressants active on the serotoninergic system, induce analgesia and potentiate morphine analgesia in a dose-related fashion. The noradrenergic tricyclic nortriptyline and trazodone did not elicit analgesia and inconsistently affected morphine analgesia. In the rat, all drugs tested increased plasma concentrations of morphine with the exception of amitriptyline. In man, only chlorimipramine and amitriptyline increased the plasma concentration of the free opiate.\r"

The DCE activity was significantly higher in men than in women. Age was related to the DCE activity independent of sex, i.e., older patients had higher enzyme activity. The activities of two substance P converting enzymes were not related to sex or age. Self-reported pain experience and affective covariates (anxiety, depression, hostility, somatization) of pain, and myelography data were not found to be related to the enzyme activity levels once adjustment had been made for sex and age. The activity levels of the enzymes measured here had no predictive value for the long-term outcome of rehabilitation and therapy at the 5-year follow-up of the patients. The sex difference in DCE activity provides further evidence in favor of the role of gender in the psychoendocrine coping with pain distress.\r"

Outcome of treatment was correlated to changes in urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The clinical impression was that placebo was superior to laser stimulation. No statistically significant difference between the analgesic effect of the laser and placebo irradiation was found on VAS-scales. A significant (P = 0.05) increase in 5-HIAA excretion was found in the placebo group. It is concluded that the possibility of a substantial placebo response should be taken into consideration using 904 nm (IR) lasers for pain treatment in patients with this type of chronic oro-facial pain.\r"

Forty probationers were needled with stainless steel needles in the point Hegu (L.I.4) on both sides under single-blind conditions. Pain threshold was measured in terms of the time (in msec) that the probationers needed to perceive the cutaneous heat stimulus of 43 degrees C. The painful stimulus was generated by a computer-controlled standardized procedure. The Wilcoxon test was used for the statistical evaluation. Laser acupuncture did not change the pain threshold. Needle acupuncture did, however, increase the pain threshold compared with the initial value (alpha = 0.1%). The difference compared with the control group, where a placebo point was needled, was also significant (alpha = 5%). This controlled experimental study proves the analgesic effect of needle acupuncture on painful heat stimuli. Laser acupuncture had no effect on pain threshold in this study.\r"

Two experiments are reported which investigate the occurrence of these effects where memory for pain is concerned. In experiment 1 the performance of 25 chronic pain patients was compared with that of 25 non-patient controls on a test involving both immediate and delayed recall of a mixed list of stimulus words of 3 types: pain-related, negative or neutral. No significant group differences were found in overall rates of immediate recall. As predicted, however, pain patients recalled more pain-related words than non-patient controls (P less than 0.001). On delayed recall the same significant group x word-type interaction was obtained (P less than 0.02), but in addition the non-patient controls recalled significantly more words overall (P less than 0.02). These results provide some evidence for the occurrence of a mood congruity effect. Experiment 2 investigated state dependent learning and mood congruity effects in experimentally induced pain. Twenty volunteer subjects were allocated to 1 of 4 conditions in which a wordlist (as in experiment 1) was presented following either a painful stimulus (cold pressor test) or a non-painful one (warm water) and was then recalled immediately following further exposure to stimulus conditions which were congruent with the original stimulus (warm/warm and cold/cold conditions) or non-congruent (warm/cold and cold/warm conditions).

The empirically derived dimensions of coping activity, as measured by scales from the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (CSQ), however, have varied across investigations. The purpose of this investigation was to determine both the content and number of dimensions of the CSQ and to explore the potential moderating influence that sociodemographic and patient history variables may have on the latent structure of the CSQ. A total of 620 patients from 5 different chronic pain patient samples were used to assess the generalizability of the dimensions across samples. Confirmatory factor analytic procedures identified a 3-factor solution in most of the samples that was robust across various demographic characteristics. Two factors appeared particularly robust: one reflected conscious use of cognitive coping strategies (with high loadings on ignoring pain and coping self-statements) and another reflected self-efficacy beliefs concerning pain (with high loadings on ability to control and decrease pain). A third factor, which was somewhat less stable, appeared to reflect avoidance of pain by attention to non-pain-related mental activity (with high loadings on diverting attention and praying and hoping). Scales reflecting catastrophizing cognitions and behavioral coping strategies did not consistently load on the above dimensions. Issues concerning the conceptualization and measurement of pain-related cognitive coping dimensions are discussed.\r"

In rats we unilaterally ligated about half of the sciatic nerve high in the thigh. Within a few hours after the operation, and for several months thereafter, the rats developed guarding behavior of the ipsilateral hind paw and licked it often, suggesting the possibility of spontaneous pain. The plantar surface of the foot was evenly hyperesthetic to non-noxious and noxious stimuli. None of the rats autotomized. There was a sharp decrease in the withdrawal thresholds bilaterally in response to repetitive Von Frey hair stimulation at the plantar side. After a series of such stimuli in the operated side, light touch elicited aversive responses, suggesting allodynia to touch. The withdrawal thresholds to CO2 laser heat pulses were markedly lowered bilaterally. Suprathreshold noxious heat pulses elicited exaggerated responses unilaterally, suggesting thermal hyperalgesia. Pin-prick evoked such exaggerated responses bilaterally (mechanical hyperalgesia). In a companion report, we show that these abnormalities critically depend on the sympathetic outflow. Based on the immediate onset and long-lasting perpetuation of similar symptoms, such as touch-evoked allodynia and hyperalgesia, and the resemblance of the contralateral phenomena to 'mirror image' pains in some humans with causalgia, we suggest that this preparation may serve as a model for syndromes of the causalgiform variety that are triggered by partial nerve injury and maintained by sympathetic activity.\r"

Sustained pinching induced a tonic reflex vasoconstriction in the stimulated hand with rather slow adaptation rate and no signs of habituation between trials. Step increases of the pinching force in the course of a stimulus were reflected by a decrease in plethysmogram amplitude as well as by increased pain ratings, although the subjects were usually unaware of these steps. Lowering the stimulus strength induced opposite, albeit much smaller effects in both pain ratings and vascular reactions. It is concluded that the vasomotor responses described in this paper are mediated by nociceptor input and reflect the processing of this input mainly at a spinal level.\r"

  ".W": "An animal model of muscular hyperalgesia was developed. In humans, this disorder follows painful crises due to ureteral calculosis. Changes in vocalization thresholds to electrical stimulation of the obliquus externus muscle of both sides were studied in a group of rats with chronically implanted muscles before and after the production of a stone in one ureter. In another group of rats with implanted muscles, it had been verified preliminarily that these thresholds did not vary widely from day to day. On the contrary, a significant lowering in threshold (max 31%) in the muscle ipsilateral to the implanted ureter appeared the day after the production of the stone and persisted for the subsequent 10 days of observation, although less pronounced during the last 5 days. Hypersensitivity to manual pressure was also observed, mainly in the ipsilateral muscle, in most rats during the same period. In order to differentiate between the effects due to the presence of the stone in the ureteral lumen and those due to the spontaneous occlusion which frequently occurred in the implanted ureter, 2 other groups of rats were studied. In one, a unilateral ureteral ligature was performed; in the other, the production of a stone was combined with a ligature (placed distally to the stone). Ligature alone never induced any hyperalgesic effect. Stone plus ligature produced a marked hyperalgesia (max 39%) in the ipsilateral muscle, which lasted for only 5 days. It is concluded that the ureteral stone is the factor responsible for the appearance of muscular hyperalgesia.\r"

Multiple and single unit extracellular recordings from nociceptive corneal afferent nerves (C-fiber cold, C-fiber chemical, A delta mechanical and A delta bimodal) were used to study the effects of He-Ne laser radiation upon the electrophysiologic responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical and electrical stimulation of the cornea. Action potentials were analyzed for latency, amplitude, rise time, duration and frequency. Exposure of the neural receptive field and/or nerve bundle to a 4-mm diameter He-Ne laser (0-5 mW; 0-1800 sec) did not alter spontaneous or evoked neural activity. In addition, single unit action potential parameters were not altered by laser irradiation. Modeling of thermal changes produced by He-Ne radiation on corneal nerves indicated that effects predicted for receptor and axonal depths in both skin and cornea were minimal (less than 0.15 degrees C) and unlikely to alter sensory transduction or transmission.\r"

  ".W": "The surgical correction of mandibular prognathism has traditionally involved posterior repositioning of the mandibular body. This treatment approach corrects the skeletal disproportion at the expense of reducing facial skeletal volume and can unpredictably result in inadequately supported soft tissues with loss of skeletal definition. In an effort to avoid these sequelae of mandibular reduction, 18 patients diagnosed as having mandibular prognathism were treated with maxillary advancement surgery at the Le Fort I level. Mean patient SNB angle was 85.2 degrees, as compared with a normal 79 +/- 3 degrees. Maxillae were documented to be in normal position relative to both cranial base and Frankfort horizontal. The mean maxillary advancement was 6.9 mm, with a range of 4.5 to 8.8 mm. All patients required genioplasty to reduce vertical chin height and/or to laterally shift the chin. At the time of follow-up (mean 16.2 months), all patients retained cephalometric data suggestive of enlarged mandibles and excessive anterior facial divergence. However, maxillomandibular harmony and facial convexity had been restored without sacrificing skeletal volume. Treatment results demonstrated these faces to be skeletally well proportioned despite lower face protrusion that was beyond \"normal.\" Postoperative appearances were characterized by a well-supported soft-tissue envelope and a highlighted skeletal foundation, creating angular, well-defined lower faces. These findings support the credibility of maxillary advancement as the procedure of choice in selected individuals with mandibular prognathism. Indications and an aesthetic rationale for this surgical approach are presented.\r"

The oldest 36 patients whose skeletal growth was for all practical purposes finished have been followed to determine the need for and type of orthognathic surgery.

The status of the tendon, the tendon-bearing bone segment, and the fracture pattern define a clinically useful classification system. Three patterns of fracture are appreciated: type I--single-segment central fragment; type II--comminuted central fragment with fractures remaining external to the medial canthal tendon insertion; and type III--comminuted central fragment with fractures extending into bone bearing the canthal insertion. Injuries are further classified as unilateral and bilateral and by their extension into other anatomic areas. The fracture pattern determines exposure and fixation. Inferior approaches alone are advised for unilateral single-segment injuries that are nondisplaced superiorly. Superior and inferior approaches are required for displaced unilateral single-segment injuries, for bilateral single-segment injuries, and for all comminuted fractures. Complete interfragment wiring of all segments is stabilized by junctional rigid fixation. All comminuted fractures require transnasal wiring of the bones of the medial orbital rim (medial canthal tendon-bearing or \"central\" bone fragment). If the fracture does not extend through the canthal insertion, the canthus should not be detached to accomplish the reduction.\r"

The natural history of these lesions is well known. Virtually all will spontaneously involute over a period of years. However, the lesions reported were particularly troublesome because of repeated ulcerations and subsequent pain. Prior treatment had been local wound care with antibiotic ointment and Telfa-type dressings. After referral from a family practitioner or pediatrician, argon laser treatment was performed in an outpatient setting. Eight of the 10 patients were treated with local anesthesia, and 2 had general anesthesia. All lesions healed in 1 to 5 weeks. No patients referred during this period were excluded from this series. All who received treatment were included. All the lesions involuted following treatment. In our estimation, the final result is identical to what may be expected after spontaneous involution of an ulcerated or infected hemangioma. The major difference is that involution occurred in a few weeks in laser-treated patients rather than a period of months or years. Ulcerated hemangiomas of the anogenital area have significant morbidity that can be efficiently avoided with the use of argon laser therapy. Lesions of the anogenital area have a strong predilection for females.\r"

Deformation of the holes into straight lines indicated the direction of maximum tension. A regular pattern was observed in adult rabbits and humans: Tension was at right angles to the long axis at the auricular base and parallel at the apex. This pattern was not present at birth, but developed at 1 to 2 weeks of age in rabbits. It is felt that these tension lines are responsible for the clinical results of auricular reconstruction. In children less than 1 week of age, tension lines are disorganized so that nonsurgical correction will be successful as long as hypoplasia is not present. In older children, correction will be successful when the deformity is parallel to the tension lines.\r"

A sizable (and growing) number of breast cancers occur in women with prior augmentation mammaplasty. Augmented breast cancer patients are currently being treated with conservation therapy, but no study has investigated complications and cosmetic results of radiation therapy specifically in this group of women. Between 1981 and 1988, we used conservation therapy in 17 augmented breast cancer patients. Fifteen patients were available for follow-up. In 10 (67 percent), significant capsular contracture occurred in the irradiated breast an average of 12 weeks following completion of treatment. Four patients have undergone revisionary surgery to correct symptoms arising from contracture. This poor outcome contradicts the results reported in previously published studies. We conclude that irradiation of the breast for cancer in augmented women results in a high incidence of scar-tissue contracture and poor cosmetic results.\r"

All patients underwent bilateral aesthetic augmentation performed by the same surgeon. Of the 165 smooth implant patients, 74 (44.8 percent) experienced contractures requiring treatment. Of the 63 textured implant patients, 3 (4.8 percent) previous contracture patients experienced sudden fibrosis within 3 months. All others remained soft.

Silicone implants completely obscure areas of the breast in mammography. Recently proposed as a filler material, peanut oil is significantly more radiolucent than normal tissue. Physiologic saline solution compares favorably as a tissue-density-simulating substance. However, saline's lack of lubricating properties results in leakage, making it less than optimal. Bio-Oncotic gel is biologically compatible. We conclude that this gel is the most appropriate filler for breast prostheses. Clinical studies are indicated.\r"

Small areas of flap necrosis can be managed with simple observation, but secondary healing may not be complete for months. Early and aggressive excision of the ischemic tissue with immediate primary closure often can achieve rapid primary healing. In addition, early revision and reshaping of the breast may, in selected patients, permit achievement of a significantly better final result. This is true not only for TRAM and latissimus dorsi flaps, but also for the mastectomy flap necrosis sometimes encountered in immediate reconstruction with simple implants or tissue expanders.\r"

This has confirmed anecdotal reports that many of the topical antibacterials are cell-toxic and may inhibit wound healing. This information can be directly extrapolated to the clinical setting, unlike many of the animal data for wound healing that currently exist.\r"

Peak stress (strength) increased equally in all groups over time (p less than 0.05), while normalized energy absorption (toughness) was markedly higher in the vitamin E-treated group after 2 weeks' incubation (p less than 0.05). These data represent the first biomechanical evidence of intrinsic tendon healing in vitro. Biomechanical methodology and vitamin effects are discussed in detail.\r"

  ".W": "Human-grade sodium heparin was studied to determine thrombosis model patency rates between an intraarterial infusion versus an intravenous method of delivery in a rabbit model. Specific differences in patency and partial thromboplastin times were studied in each group and compared with a saline-perfused group. Three animal groups (New Zealand white rabbits) were established (total = 35 animals). Standardized femoral arterial 5-mm inversion grafts (AIG) were done in each animal in each group. The animals in the control group received intravenous saline infusion, while the two treatment groups received intravenous heparin (12 animals) or intraarterial heparin (12 animals minus 1 anesthesia death). The route of instillation of the infusate was selected at random after completing the inversion grafts. A proximal epigastric branch was utilized for access in those animals randomized to the intraarterial group. Intravenous delivery was accomplished by means of a femoral venous catheter in the vena cava. A 72-hour period of infusion was used in all animals. A dose of 45 units per hour of heparin following a 500-unit bolus was used in the intravenous group. After an identical bolus dose, 25 units per hour of heparin was administered in the intraarterial group. The control (saline group) was given 1 cc saline (in a volume equal to the heparin-dosed groups) daily for 3 days. Arterial inversion graft patency rates were assessed by direct inspection at day 5. Systemic and regional (i.e., distal to the inversion graft) partial thromboplastin times (PTT) were measured in representative control, IV, and intraarterial heparin-treated groups. Complications were recorded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Despite its benign microscopic features, it has an aggressive local behavior and, if not excised adequately, has a tendency to recur locally and invade neighboring structures with significant potential for morbidity, deformity, or even death. Two cases of recurrent extraabdominal desmoid tumors are presented not only because they are highly representative of this disease, but also because they emphasize the need for aggressive surgical treatment. Also, they are unusual and challenging cases from a reconstructive standpoint. Based on this experience and on the most recent literature, we believe that this tumor, regardless of its microscopic features, should be addressed and treated as a malignancy.\r"

There were 22 episodes of native valve endocarditis (NVE) and 19 episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). The overall mortality before completion of therapy was 15% (18% due to NVE and 11% due to PVE). Among patients with NVE, involvement of the aortic valve was significantly associated with death or complicated illness (defined as the need for valve replacement before completion of antibiotic therapy or relapse of endocarditis after completion of therapy). Among patients who survived episodes of PVE, 69% were cured without surgical intervention. Gentamicin was administered in combination with a penicillin or vancomycin in the majority of episodes (mean duration of therapy with aminoglycosides: 5 weeks). Renal dysfunction occurred in 44% of patients who received gentamicin and occurred more frequently in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels before treatment. Our results suggest that enterococcal PVE can often be successfully treated with antibiotics alone, and they confirm the efficacy of gentamicin when it is administered in combination with cell wall-active agents for the treatment of endocarditis due to enterococci that lack high-level resistance to this agent.\r"

It has been well defined in vitro as a rapid lytic response utilizing minute amounts of IgG antibody. In vitro studies have shown ADCC restriction of the spread of virus. In vivo studies using adoptive transfer of human or murine ADCC effector cells plus antibody and ADCC-active, nonneutralizing F(ab1)2 antibody fragments or monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated the important role of this response in animal models of HSV infection. In humans, ADCC effector function and/or antibody levels have been associated with the outcome of infection, especially in immunocompromised patients and neonates. Reconstitution of this mechanism with appropriate antibodies or cytokines in high-risk hosts, with the resultant amelioration of severe HSV infection, will validate ADCC as a critical component of antiviral defense.\r"

In addition, frequency of resistance to six beta-lactam antibiotics (cefmetazole, cefotetan, ceftizoxime, imipenem, penicillin, and cefoxitin) and to clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole was determined for each species. While B. fragilis was most commonly isolated, the other species of the B. fragilis group accounted for half of the isolates. Seven percent of 1,128 patients with infections due to species of the B. fragilis group were bacteremic. A review of bacteremic cases indicated that non-fragilis species were highly pathogenic. Resistance to clindamycin ranged from 8% to 22% among species and was most common among isolates of Bacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Significant differences in antimicrobial activity were noted among the agents tested. Only imipenem, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole were predictably effective against non-fragilis species of the B. fragilis group. Prompt identification of species and susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of this group are needed if a newer beta-lactam agent or clindamycin is to be used for initial therapy.\r"

We present a case report of pericardial actinomycosis and a review of 18 other cases reported in the literature since 1950. Possible risk factors include aspiration pneumonia, alcohol abuse, and periodontal disease. Actinomyces may cause purulent pericarditis that evolves into cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. Clues to the identity of the causative organism (e.g., draining sinus tracts and the presence of sulfur granules) are frequently absent, and cultures often fail to yield the organism. Histologic examination of material obtained by biopsy is often necessary to make the diagnosis. Most cases originate from a thoracopulmonary site of actinomycosis and spread directly to the pericardium. Widespread dissemination to extrathoracic organs is uncommon. Treatment consists of high-dose, long-term antimicrobial therapy as well as drainage of the pericardial space.\r"

Because the efficacy of various modalities in the diagnosis of such complications is not well established, a selective review of the published literature on this issue is worthwhile. The electrocardiogram is the easiest study to obtain. It is quite specific in identifying perivalvular extension of infection when conduction system disease is demonstrated but has a low degree of sensitivity overall. Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and color-flow Doppler echocardiography are the most practical and useful techniques for diagnosis of perivalvular extension of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging also appears to be an effective tool in this setting; however, because of a paucity of clinical data, its precise utility has not yet been determined. Nuclear medicine studies and computed tomography play a minimal role. Cardiac catheterization is as useful as the echocardiographic techniques but is invasive, not as readily available, and significantly riskier in terms of complications. An approach to the diagnosis of perivalvular extension of infection is proposed on the basis of the literature review.\r"

Eleven (35%) of the patients discussed in this report had AIDS or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which is emerging as the leading cause of immunosuppression in cases of R. equi infection. Seventy-seven percent of all patients had pneumonia due to R. equi, and the infiltrate frequently cavitated. When HIV-infected patients were compared with those not infected with the virus, symptoms, age, and frequency of pneumonia were similar. Sputum and blood cultures were more likely to be positive in HIV-infected patients. Individuals with HIV infection also had a higher incidence of simultaneous secondary infections and higher mortality than non-HIV-infected patients (54.5% vs. 20%). The rate of survival for all patients was 75% when antibiotics were combined with surgical resection of infected tissue; in comparison, the survival rate among patients receiving antibiotics alone was 61.1%.\r"

  ".W": "This review analyzes several aspects of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes mellitus, including prevalence, bacteriology, coexistent risk factors, localization, natural history, and treatment. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is threefold higher among diabetic women than among nondiabetic women. However, rates among diabetic and nondiabetic men are similar. Studies consistently document that the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not influenced by the type or duration of diabetes or by the quality of diabetic control. The microorganisms causing asymptomatic bacteriuria in persons with diabetes mellitus are similar to those causing bacteriuria in nondiabetic individuals. More than half of diabetic patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria have upper urinary tract involvement. The long-term consequences of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes mellitus are poorly documented. Clinical trials describing the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in this population suggest that a 2-week course of therapy is equivalent to a 6-week course for the initial eradication of bacteriuria and that, following treatment, reinfection rather than relapse usually occurs. Important questions remaining include whether asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated in this population and what the optimal antimicrobial regimen is.\r"

A 21-year-old Indian man presented with an 18-month history of episodic confusion followed by a grand mal seizure. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the presence of a lesion of the left occipital lobe. Subsequent stereotactic biopsy revealed a plerocercoid larva or sparganum. Surgical resection resulted in cure. This case prompted a review of the literature on central nervous system sparganosis. Altogether, 17 other cases of primary cerebral sparganosis have been reported previously. Seizures, headache, and focal neurologic signs are common at presentation. Neuroradiologic imaging is sensitive but not specific for the identification of lesions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cerebrospinal fluid or serum may be diagnostically helpful. However, the diagnosis is generally made after surgical resection, which is usually curative.\r"

CSF studies revealed neutrophilic pleocytosis (83% of cases, greater than 500 white blood cells/mm3), hypoglycorrhachia (64%, less than 40 mg of glucose/dL), and elevated protein level (61%, greater than 100 mg/dL). In 43% of cases there was an associated brain abscess. Patients with brain abscess had more frequent and severe aberrations in mental status as well as higher initial white blood cell counts in CSF. Mortality was 52% for the 23 cases diagnosed antemortem and 57% overall. Compared with patients who died, survivors were younger, had lower initial CSF glucose levels, and were less likely to have brain abscess. Diagnosis was often delayed, and nocardial infection was rarely suspected before positive culture reports or autopsy findings became available.\r"

Quantitative differences were noted between cases of bacteremia arising from different sources and caused by different organisms. No mortality was associated with bacteremia of bone and joint origin. Mortality from bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, bacteremia with Escherichia coli of urinary tract origin, endocarditis, and beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia showed an early plateau effect, with a drop before day 20. Cases of bacteremia from intravascular sources other than endocarditis were associated with no initial mortality, but mortality rose progressively after day 5. Bacteremia related to most organisms and sources was associated with mortality that continued until at least day 20.\r"

Eight infections involved one or more joints, and three involved thoracic, cervical, and widespread cutaneous sites, respectively. For eight patients all evidence of infection resolved during therapy. Sustained remissions (6 months to 5 years) were noted for six patients after the discontinuation of all therapy and for an additional patient 4 years after the initiation of ketoconazole treatment. Durable responses were associated with prolonged treatment with 400-800 mg of ketoconazole daily.

  ".W": "In an investigation of a 21-year-old epidemic of severe hepatitis, 80 serum samples were studied from two isolated Yanomami Amerindian populations of the Upper Orinoco basin in Venezuela. Of the assayed samples, 30.6% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), 53.7% were considered to reflect immunity to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and only 16.2% were believed to reflect susceptibility to HBV infection; 82.5% of the samples tested positive for any marker of HBV infection. Thirty-one (39.7%) of 78 samples were also positive for antibody to delta antigen, including 91.6% of those positive for HBsAg and 20.9% of those immune to HBV. Our findings provide evidence of a high prevalence of HBV infection in this population. Furthermore, the high prevalence of antibody to delta antigen strongly suggests that coinfections with HBV or superinfections with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in HBV carriers may be an important factor in the occurrence of an unusually high number of cases of fulminant hepatitis and of chronic liver disease. Serum samples obtained at the beginning of the outbreak 13 years earlier from 36 selected cases in the same population revealed a high rate of HBV infection (96.5%). All six HBsAg carriers from whom enough serum remained to be assayed were positive for antibody to delta antigen. Our findings indicate that the outbreak coincided with the introduction of HDV into a population with an already-high prevalence of HBV infection.\r"

A retrospective review was performed of all patients seen at Duke University Medical Center between January 1981 and July 1989 who were infected with both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and C. neoformans. Of 31 patients with these concomitant infections, 12 had cryptococcal pneumonia (10 definite and two presumptive cases). Eleven of these 12 patients had evidence of extrapulmonary cryptococcal disease as well. Chest radiography showed interstitial infiltrates in 11 instances. For ten of the 12 patients, pulmonary cultures were positive for C. neoformans. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from all five patients who underwent bronchoscopy yielded the organism. Acute-phase mortality from cryptococcosis was 42% among patients with pneumonia. Cryptococcal pneumonia in patients with AIDS is probably more common than has previously been recognized and typically presents as interstitial disease that may mimic other opportunistic infections.\r"

A 54-year-old man developed respiratory distress and symptoms of upper airway obstruction unresponsive to inhaled bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, or intravenous erythromycin. A spirometry flow-volume loop demonstrated fixed upper airway obstruction. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination revealed a circumferential inflammatory process partially occluding the tracheal lumen. Gram staining revealed gram-positive rods typical of corynebacteria, and cultures of tracheal tissue yielded C. pseudodiphtheriticum resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence for exotoxin or cell-associated toxins. Treatment with intravenous penicillin resulted in resolution of the inflammatory process and eradication of the organisms, as assessed by subsequent cultures.\r"

During intervals when patients were not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis, infections occurred at an average rate of 2.6 per patient-year, but the rate varied widely from patient to patient (range 0.3-7.6 episodes per year). Seventy-three percent of the observed episodes were symptomatic, with an 18:1 ratio of cystitis to pyelonephritis episodes. Infectious episodes were strikingly clustered, and rates of infection decreased in the winter months. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was highly effective in preventing acute cystitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and acute pyelonephritis, even when used for as long as 5 years. The proportions of infecting strains resistant in vitro to ampicillin (19%-32%) and nitrofurantoin (5%-18%) were unchanged over the 15-year observation period, while resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased in the last 5 years of the study.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of a 12-year study of 58 patients at our medical center who had group A streptococcal bacteremia, we found that this disease is not uncommon when compared with other varieties of bacteremia. It occurs with about one-half of the frequency of bacteremias due to Klebsiella species and one-eighth of that of bacteremias due to Staphylococcus aureus. The infection is infrequently nosocomial (3.5% of cases) and the predominant causes are cutaneous or subcutaneous infections (72% of cases). While many patients are chronically ill, debilitated, or elderly, in our institution, as in some other public hospitals, the most important underlying condition is a history of iv drug abuse (28% of cases). Our data and those of some other recent publications suggest that the occurrence of cases related to iv drug abuse may be increasing. Intravenous drug abusers tend to be young adults, while other sources of infection are found more frequently in older patients. The frequent presence (10.3% of cases) of other organisms (especially S. aureus) in the blood of patients with group A streptococcal bacteremia has not been sufficiently emphasized in previous studies.\r"

Compared with older age groups, children from birth through 10 years of age were more anemic, those from birth through 5 years of age had a higher mean white blood cell count, and those from birth through 1 year of age had a lower mean blood carbon dioxide content (all P less than .05). Female patients were more severely anemic than male patients (P less than .05). The case-fatality rate was 4.3% overall, with the highest rates for children from birth through 1 year of age (11%) and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age (10%). Female patients had a higher case-fatality rate (6%) than male patients (3%), although the difference was not significant (P greater than .05). Death was independently associated with seizures, intestinal perforation, pneumonia, and delirium or coma. These results indicated that the patients with typhoid fever who were at highest risk of complications and death were children from birth through 1 year of age and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age.\r"

  ".U": "91205197\r", 
  ".W": "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral disease that occurs over wide areas of Europe and Asia. Hantaviruses are the cause of this syndrome. The hallmark of HFRS is the triad of fever, hemorrhage, and renal failure. In its severe form it is associated with significant mortality. The syndrome evolves through five phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent. The central physiologic derangement in HFRS is vascular dysfunction, manifested by impaired vascular tone and increased vascular permeability. The systemic effects of this dysfunction account for the occurrence of hypotension and shock, while local effects are probably important in the development of renal failure. Shock in HFRS has distributive and oligemic features, while renal failure has features of acute tubular necrosis. Hemorrhage is a consequence of vascular injury and a deficit of functional platelets. Vascular and platelet dysfunction are both compounded by uremia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to hemorrhage in some patients. Although hantaviruses are infectious for endothelial cells and may cause direct injury, a large body of evidence suggests that immune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of HFRS.\r"

Each patient is seen by a physician, pharmacist, and nurse; these health care professionals share data about the patient and offer 24-hour coverage of questions and emergencies. Treating a wide variety of diseases, physicians utilize their experience and the center's intercommunication system to choose drugs most suitable for outpatient use and to carry on research. Costs in the center run between 50% and 60% lower than those in the hospital. Reimbursement, although difficult in the past, has improved considerably, but some third-party payers, including Medicare, have not reimbursed for outpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy.\r"

Patients with conditions such as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and skin and soft tissue infections are appropriate candidates. As clinical experience grows, patients with increasingly complex conditions are being successfully treated at home. Before OPIVAT can be utilized, mode of iv access, length of therapy, antibiotic selection, laboratory tests, and physician of record must be determined. Patients must be instructed how to handle emergencies. With appropriate training, such patients learn to properly manage drugs and equipment and to recognize complications. Patients who cannot be treated at home may be candidates for OPIVAT under direct medical supervision. Technical advances in pumps and catheters--as well as future changes in Medicare reimbursement--may greatly increase the number of patients who are capable of receiving OPIVAT.\r"

These risk factors include an age of 3 months to 3 years, a temperature of greater than or equal to 39.0 degrees C, and a white blood cell count of greater than or equal to 15,000/mm3. Although results are delayed, a culture of blood is the only definitive test. Studies suggest that treatment with various antibiotics may be helpful, but that some drugs, particularly orally administered amoxicillin, should not be relied on to eliminate occult bacteremia or prevent its most serious sequela, meningitis.\r"

The antibiotic must remain effective at least throughout the period of transport to hospital and surgery. Use of antimicrobial agents will never replace careful surgical debridement, and these drugs should be used again later only if a bacterial infection develops. Other considerations include the choice of a drug that penetrates tissue thoroughly, is simple to store and administer, is easily available, and is cost effective.\r"

Although the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends rifampin for prophylaxis of meningococcal disease, there are failures of treatment and adverse reactions associated with the administration of this drug, and it cannot be used during pregnancy. In 1987, during an outbreak of group A meningococcal disease in Saudi Arabia, the efficacy of a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone was compared with the standard regimen of rifampin for eradication of pharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis among persons at risk. Follow-up cultures indicated successful eradication for 97% of those who received ceftriaxone and 75% of those who received rifampin. Thus, although ceftriaxone exceeds rifampin in fulfilling the criteria for an effective prophylactic agent, recommendations regarding its use still must be made with caution because of limited clinical experience.\r"

Therefore, physicians may wish to establish their own office-based programs for providing cost-effective, quality care for patients who can be treated on an outpatient basis. Important factors in the establishment of such a program are obtaining the services of a nurse skilled in administration of iv antibiotics and the services of a cooperative pharmacist, utilizing treatment consent forms and instructive handouts for patients, and providing 7-day-per-week nursing care. Physicians must immediately hospitalize program participants who experience complications. To ensure cooperation from third-party payers, familiarity with their codes for procedural terminology is necessary. It is also highly advisable to obtain written approval for a patient's participation in the program from the medical director or another key official of the insurance company.\r"

The responses of normal spleen cells to B cell lines that express the defective virus indicated that these lines express a cell surface determinant that shares \"superantigenic\" properties with some microbial antigens and Mls-like self antigens. This antigen elicited a potent proliferative response that was dependent on the presence of CD4+ T cells and was associated with selective expansion of cells bearing V beta 5. This response was markedly inhibited by a monoclonal antibody specific for the MuLV gag-encoded p30 antigen.\r"

Whether these two reactions use the same or different guanosine-binding sites has been debated. A double mutation in a previously identified guanosine-binding site within the intron resulted in preference for adenosine (or adenosine triphosphate) as the substrate for cleavage at the 5' splice site. However, splicing was blocked in the exon ligation step. Blockage was reversed by a change from guanine to adenine at the 3' splice site. These results indicate that a single determinant specifies nucleoside binding for both steps of splicing. Furthermore, it suggests that RNA could form an active site specific for adenosine triphosphate.\r"

Extravesicular calcium acted as a coagonist, potentiating the transient IP3-induced release of calcium-45. Thus, rapid elevation of cytosolic calcium levels may trigger IP3-induced calcium release in vivo. Extravesicular calcium also produced a more slowly developing, reversible inhibition of IP3-induced calcium-45 release. Sequential positive and negative feedback regulation by calcium of IP3-induced calcium release may contribute to transients and oscillations of cytosolic-free calcium in vivo.\r"

Expression of PI-G PLD complementary DNA in COS cells produced a protein that specifically hydrolyzed the inositol phosphate linkage of the PI-G anchor. Cotransfection of PI-G PLD with a PI-G-anchored protein resulted in the secretion of the PI-G-anchored protein.

The anterior surface of the proximal urethra is firmly anchored to the posterior aspect of the symphysis pubis by the pubourethral ligaments and to the remaining distal vagina by the lower two thirds of the urogenital diaphragm. The lateral bladder wall derives its support from the anterior vaginal wall attachments to the pelvic sidewall. The anterior vaginal wall is strongly supported by pubococcygeus muscle fibers inserting on the vaginal wall and the genital hiatus and by the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments. Vaginal detachment from the lateral pelvic sidewall can result in herniation, with accompanying secondary posterior bladder descent. Levator ani weakness or injury may be a contributing etiologic factor in the genesis of vaginal wall detachment and the development of stress incontinence.\r"

  ".W": "The use of urodynamic testing must be selective and based on the particular patient's complaints. In today's cost-conscious health care environment, a diagnosis based on one or two tests is preferable to exposing each patient to the full battery of available tests. For most patients, a cystometrogram and voiding cystourethrogram can confirm a variety of clinical suspicions. A cystometrogram best indicates how the bladder is behaving during filling. The voiding cystourethrogram allows the physician to observe the bladder and urethra during voiding and offers an excellent view of the anatomic relations of the urologic organs in the pelvis. The other important benefit of urodynamics is the objective data made available in hardcopy as a baseline study to be utilized for comparison in the future. The normal sequence of testing is a noninvasive uroflow study to determine the baseline flow rate. The postvoiding residual volume of urine is then determined. A cystometrogram and electromyography can then be done, the latter if there is a suggestion of neurologic disease or if otherwise indicated to determine bladder behavior on filling. Variations that are helpful when a patient fails to have a bladder contraction include having the patient in an upright or seated position during the test. A bethanechol supersensitivity test may be indicated as well. The urethral pressure profile may be done as the catheter is withdrawn and the bladder is already filled. The filled invasive flow rate can then be compared with the free flow rate. Sometimes, one of these rates is abnormal, and there is a question about whether the abnormality is real. The residual urine volume can be determined by subtracting the volume the patient voids from the filling volume. In the end, the key to urodynamic evaluation is the interpretation of the test, which should be made only by the individual actually performing the test. It truly is necessary for the physician to be there in person. Selective use of urodynamics can target an appropriate treatment for most patients. The female patient who complains of incontinence in whom the history suggests detrusor instability may benefit from a trial of cholinolytic therapy if no anatomic defect is present. In this type of patient, a surgical procedure may not be of benefit, whereas the cholinolytic therapy probably will work. This is a good reason for always choosing the appropriate urodynamic tests for evaluating and planning treatment for patients with urinary incontinence.\r"

Evaluation must be multifactorial and extend beyond the genitourinary system, because many age-related conditions and the drugs used to treat them can cause or exacerbate urinary incontinence. Voiding records are a reliable measure of severity, although studies of their validity are still lacking. History-taking requires more time in this age group. Stress incontinence symptoms remain very sensitive, whereas obstructive symptoms fall in predictive value. Clinical algorithms based on a combination of symptoms and simple bedside examination and maneuvers may prove most useful in specific settings such as nursing homes. The targeting and interpretation of the physical examination must also change because of age-related conditions (e.g., BPH, atrophic vaginitis) and prevalent comorbid diseases, especially neurologic ones. The Q-tip, elevation, and pessary tests for stress incontinence offer little diagnostic or therapeutic information in the elderly. Routine laboratory tests should be performed to exclude reversible causes of urinary incontinence, while interpretation of the urinalysis must consider the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. No radiographic studies are routinely needed; bead-chain cystourethrography and IVU in particular probably offer little additional information. Voiding cystourethrography, although little studied, offers dynamic data that may be helpful, especially in evaluating outlet obstruction. Bedside cystometry is simple but may be insensitive to the most prevalent type of detrusor instability in the institutionalized elderly. Finally, multichannel urodynamic study is safe and feasible even in frail elderly patients and should be considered when empiric therapy is risky or has failed, complicated comorbidity exists, or surgery is anticipated.\r"

First, the urologist should have a special interest in the neurophysiology of lower urinary tract disorders.

Regardless of technique, the goal common to all procedures designed to cure stress urinary incontinence is to immobilize and support the hypermobile urethra. The support provided by the operation creates a foundation on which the urethra can be compressed shut during abdominal straining. The operation of choice is determined by its ability to provide this strong foundation over a long period of time. Although numerous reports have been published outlining the results of bladder neck suspension, most authors have not utilized objective long-term follow-up when assessing cure rates. We prefer either the Burch colpourethropexy or the modified Pereyra needle bladder neck suspension because the vaginal wall is firmly supportive without interfering with the delicate mechanisms of the urethra.\r"

Anatomic damage ranges from small urethrovaginal fistulas to total loss of the urethra, vesical neck, and trigone. For functional damage, the goal is compression of the proximal urethra, and the author favors a pubovaginal fascial sling, which is described. In the author's view, the best results in anatomic loss are obtained by performing an appropriate anti-incontinence procedure at the time of urethral reconstruction.\r"

  ".U": "91205675\r", 
  ".W": "The collective published experience with continent urinary diversions, together with our own, indicates that there are certain basic principles with regard to continence, which is dependent on: (1) the pressure generated by the reservoir; (2) the outflow resistance of the outlet; and (3) detubularization, which is crucial to diminish the uninhibited involuntary bowel contractions. Detubularized ileal pouches provide the lowest pressures (less than 20 cm H2O). Although the majority of patients (approximately 85%) who have a low-pressure ileal neobladder are completely continent, a few experience persistent nocturnal incontinence as a result of low resting urethral pressure. Numerous continence methods have been described, each with its own unique set of problems. The most physiologic continence mechanism is the external urethral sphincter in men. It is clear that total continence with this mechanism is not assured. Other factors such as reservoir contractions, overflow incontinence, decreased sphincter tone, and loss of the normal vesicourethral reflex play an important role in nocturnal incontinence. However, understanding these contributing elements will allow us to refine the construction of a continent physiologic bladder substitute.\r"

The myocutaneous flap appeared as a unilateral arcuate band of soft tissue extending from the linea alba to the rectal fascia or sacrum. Additional CT findings included asymmetric thinning of the ventral abdominal wall (7/8), fluid collections (2/8), vaginal breakdown (1/8), presacral soft-tissue thickening (6/8), and tumor recurrence (3/8).

The histologic and pathologic similarities of the lesions and the controversial relationship between fibrous dysplasia, osteofibrous dysplasia, and adamantinoma complicate the matter. We found a large overlap of histologic features in lesions considered either fibrous dysplasia or osteofibrous dysplasia on the basis of the radiologic findings. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of the plain radiograph of the lower leg in combination with clinical findings to differentiate the benign from the malignant condition. The clinical symptoms, radiographs, and histologic slides of 46 patients with fibrous dysplasia and 22 with adamantinoma in the tibia were reviewed retrospectively. In only one of 12 patients with radiologic or histologic characteristics of osteofibrous dysplasia were both radiologic and histologic criteria for the diagnosis present. A linear discriminant analysis was performed on six clinical (age, spontaneous pain, pain after trauma, swelling only, pain and swelling, and bowing deformity) and 25 radiologic signs. Fibrous dysplasia and its variant osteofibrous dysplasia could be identified correctly in 87% (40 of 46 patients) and adamantinoma in 95% (21 of 22 patients) by using the patient's age and four radiologic signs. When results from the discriminant analysis of a randomized subgroup of patients (32) were used on the other subgroup (36 patients), fibrous dysplasia was correctly identified in 84% (21 of 25) and adamantinoma in 82% (nine of 11). Fibrous dysplasia is more prevalent than adamantinoma in a young patient, when radiographs show a ground-glass appearance and anterior bowing and when there is no multilayered periosteal reaction and moth-eaten destruction. When radiologic signs and the patient's age are combined, fibrous dysplasia and adamantinoma can be discriminated in a high percentage of patients.\r"

However, no previous studies have been performed to determine the degree of interobserver and intraobserver variability in such determinations. We measured the interobserver and intraobserver error in sonographic measurements of renal length obtained independently by three experienced imagers in 21 children (41 kidneys). The mean interobserver variation between any two imagers ranged from 3.87 to 5.49 mm. The mean intraobserver variation was 0.87 to 3.61 mm. The observed variability in sonographic measurement of renal length is comparable to the expected annual increase in length of the kidneys during childhood (2.2-5.7 mm per year). Therefore, caution is suggested when using sonography to evaluate renal growth in children during a year's time.\r"

Twelve had clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease, 13 were healthy renal donors, and 15 underwent vascular interventional procedures. The aorta and the ipsilateral iliac artery were examined in real time under fluoroscopic guidance and the results were compared with angiography. Sonography in eight of the 13 renal donors showed arterial wall abnormalities in the absence of angiographic evidence of disease. Sonography of the 15 patients after angioplasty or atherectomy demonstrated plaque fractures, intramural dissections, or atherectomy grooves. Our experience suggests that intravascular sonography is of value in reducing the use of angiography to monitor progress or complications of vascular interventional procedures.\r"

Thirty-nine patients (75%) had symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (dizziness, blurred vision, ataxia). Angioplasty was successful in 40 (93%) of 43 patients with stenosis and in five (56%) of nine patients with occlusion. In the successfully treated patients, follow-up angiograms showed absence of narrowing greater than 30% stenosis, and the blood pressure in the treated arm equaled that in the opposite arm. The patients were followed up for 6-48 months (mean, 29 months). During this time, the blood pressure in the treated arm remained normal in 41 (91%) of 45 patients. The symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency subsided in 28 (72%) of 39 patients. These results suggest that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is useful for treating subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion.\r"

Simultaneous half-exposure phosphor plate and full-exposure conventional screen/film venograms were obtained of 35 patients and compared by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve ranged from 0.67 to 0.78 for conventional films and 0.68 to 0.91 for phosphor plates. Group performances on conventional films vs phosphor plates were not statistically different. No statistically significant difference in individual performance with the two techniques was seen in seven of the eight interpreters at the 95% confidence level. The eighth interpreter performed significantly better with phosphor plates than with conventional films. Interpreters with and without specific experience in phosphor plate venography were grouped separately, and performance of the two groups was compared in each technique. No difference in performance was found between the groups when interpreting conventional venograms, but, when interpreting phosphor plate venograms, the group with specific experience performed significantly better than they had with conventional venograms, and significantly better than the other group did at interpreting either conventional or phosphor plate venograms. We conclude that phosphor plate venograms made at a 50% reduction in X-ray exposure are equal to, and may surpass, conventional screen/film venograms for diagnosing acute venous thrombosis of the calf and thigh. We recommend expanding the indications for phosphor plate radiography to include contrast venography of the lower extremities.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans in five patients with severe ligamentous compression of the celiac axis, confirmed by surgery and/or angiography, and compared the findings with those of enhanced scans of 100 consecutive patients without known ligamentous compression. In all five patients with ligamentous celiac artery compression, CT showed effacement or narrowing of the celiac trunk by an anterior soft-tissue band. Dilated peripancreatic collateral vessels were seen in four cases, and poststenotic dilatation of the distal celiac trunk was seen in two cases. The normal appearance of the vasculature was seen in the majority (76%) of the 100 control subjects, but in eight patients the celiac origin was obscured on CT scans, and in 16 patients the celiac trunk appeared narrow or effaced. Our experience suggests that severe ligamentous celiac artery compression can be identified on CT. However, the isolated CT finding of effacement or obscuration of the celiac axis occurs sufficiently often in normal patients that it is not adequate evidence to establish the diagnosis of celiac artery compression.\r"

  ".U": "91206244\r", 
  ".W": "During the interval from January 1989 to March 1990, signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis developed in six patients during barium enema examinations in our institution. In all six cases the symptoms of anaphylaxis began during the procedure, usually within 10 min of starting the examination. The principal manifestation of anaphylaxis was severe hypotension, usually accompanied by edema and urticaria. The symptoms were considered potentially life threatening in all patients, and one patient died despite prompt recognition of the anaphylactic nature of the reaction and resuscitative efforts. Serum samples were obtained within a few hours of the reaction in two patients and at autopsy in the fatal case: all three samples showed elevated concentrations of mast cell tryptase, demonstrating the systemic release of anaphylactic mediators. In vitro tests demonstrated the presence of immunoglobulin E antibodies specific for latex allergens in five of the six cases. Further in vitro inhibition tests confirmed the specificity of the antibodies for latex allergens and demonstrated that similar allergens were found in both raw latex, latex gloves, and catheter balloons. Only one patient was willing to undergo a skin test, and her skin test was positive for extracts of latex products. After considering multiple possibilities, we conclude that the reactions associated with barium enemas observed in these six patients are most probably the result of latex allergy.\r"

The contributions of CT, MR imaging, and sonography are discussed and illustrated. Colorectal carcinoma is the second most common tumor in the United States and the most common cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. The prognosis for patients with this neoplasm is closely related to the extent of tumor at the time of diagnosis. Accurate noninvasive preoperative assessment of tumor stage by one or a combination of radiologic techniques would enable appropriate treatment to be planned in each case. Also, determination of possible tumor recurrence would permit effective monitoring of success of therapy and surgical intervention for recurrent disease before widespread metastasis occurs.\r"

  ".W": "This study is a retrospective survey of the variables that may influence the development of pneumothorax after thoracentesis. In a 30-month period, a computer search of hospital records identified 342 thoracenteses, of which 154 were done with conventional techniques by the clinical services, and 188 were done with sonographic guidance. Other factors surveyed included the patients' age, sex, underlying pulmonary disease, and overall clinical condition; the size of the effusion; the type of tap (diagnostic or therapeutic); the amount and type (exudate or transudate) of fluid acquired; and the size of the needles used. The technique used was the most significant single risk factor affecting the development of pneumothorax (18% for clinical vs 3% for sonography-guided thoracenteses). The incidence of pneumothorax decreased when a smaller amount of pleural fluid was aspirated (mean, 246 ml aspirated from patients who did not vs 472 ml from those who did develop pneumothorax) and when thin needles were used (4% pneumothorax with 20-gauge or smaller and 18% with larger than 20-gauge needles). The other factors surveyed did not influence the development of pneumothorax. Our results show that sonography-guided thoracentesis is complicated by pneumothorax significantly less often than is thoracentesis done with conventional techniques. Use of the smallest possible needle and aspiration of the smallest possible amount of fluid will also result in fewer cases of pneumothorax.\r"

  ".U": "91206247\r", 
  ".W": "Despite improved techniques--such as bronchoscopy and percutaneous needle biopsy--to evaluate pulmonary nodules, there are still many cases in which surgical resection is necessary before carcinoma can be differentiated from benign lesions. The present study was undertaken to determine if the presence of an air bronchogram or air bronchiologram (patent visible bronchus or bronchiole) is useful in distinguishing small lung cancers from benign nodules. Thin-section chest CT scans were obtained in patients with 20 peripheral lung cancers less than 2 cm in diameter (18 adenocarcinomas, one squamous cell carcinoma, and one large cell carcinoma) and 20 small benign nodules (eight hamartomas, seven tuberculomas, two foci of aspergillosis, one focus of cryptococcosis, one chronic focal interstitial pneumonitis, and one plasma cell granuloma). The images were compared with regard to the patency of any bronchus or bronchiole within the lesions. After surgical resection, the specimens were inflated with agar and sectioned transversely to correlate gross morphology and low-power histologic sections with the CT appearance. An air bronchogram or air bronchiologram was seen in the tumors on 65% of CT scans and 70% of histologic sections. Benign nodules had a patent bronchus or bronchiole on CT scans and histologic sections in only one case (5%). These findings suggest that the presence of an air bronchogram in a lung nodule is a useful finding to help differentiate adenocarcinomas from benign lesions.\r"

  ".U": "91206248\r", 
  ".W": "The pulmonary nodule CT reference phantom is widely used in the evaluation of nodules 2 cm or less in diameter. It is used to detect benign patterns of calcification that are not visible on thin-section CT scans. Since 1986, the reference nodules have been manufactured with a nominal composition of 185 H. The multicenter study published in 1986 used nodules with a nominal composition of 264 H, 100 H more than the threshold value reported by Siegelman et al. in 1980. In the multicenter study, one of 37 nodules diagnosed as benign with the phantom proved to be malignant. The purpose of this study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate with the 185-H phantom and to ascertain whether the malignant tumors predicted to be benign actually contained calcification. We retrospectively reviewed 296 cases in which examinations had been performed with the 185-H nodules since 1986. Eighty-five nodules were diagnosed as benign by comparison to the reference phantom. These 85 contained no visible calcification on thin-section CT scans. Ten of the 85 cases were shown to be malignant tumors. Eight were diagnosed as having a high probability of benignity. Two were diagnosed as having a moderate probability of benignity. Calcium was present in the tissue of all six nodules available for review. Fifty-nine of the 85 nodules were still clinically indeterminate at the time of this review. Even if all of the clinically indeterminate nodules are benign, the misdiagnosis rate would be significantly higher than in most previous studies. Although analysis by using the reference phantom with 185-H nodules may indicate a high probability of benignity, close radiologic follow-up is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Sonographic identification of thickening of the gallbladder wall that consists of multiple striations (alternate hypoechoic and hyperechoic layers) has been considered strong evidence of the presence of acute cholecystitis. We studied 27 patients in whom sonograms showed striated thickening of the gallbladder wall to determine the diagnostic significance of this finding. Striations were classified as focal or diffuse. Sonograms were correlated with pathologic findings in 16 patients and with clinical diagnoses and laboratory findings in 11. Patients were categorized as having cholecystitis with or without gangrene or edema of the gallbladder wall unrelated to gallbladder disease. Striated thickening of the gallbladder wall was due to cholecystitis in 10 patients, and all 10 had gangrenous changes at surgery or at pathologic examination. Striations were focal in eight of these patients and diffuse in two. Striated thickening of the gallbladder wall was due to edema of the wall unrelated to gallbladder disease in 17 patients. Causes included congestive heart failure (n = 4), renal failure (n = 5), liver disease (hepatic failure [n = 1], hepatitis [n = 6]), ascites (n = 2), hypoalbuminemia (n = 3), pancreatitis (n = 1), blockage of the lymphatic/venous drainage of the gallbladder (n = 2), and prominent Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (n = 1). More than one abnormality was present in five patients. Striations were focal in 11 of these patients and diffuse in six. The sonographic finding of striated gallbladder wall thickening is no more specific for cholecystitis than the observation of gallbladder wall thickening by itself, and it may occur in a variety of diseases. However, in the clinical setting of acute cholecystitis, the presence of striations suggests gangrenous changes in the gallbladder. The extent of the striations (focal or diffuse) is not useful in predicting the cause of the striated gallbladder wall thickening.\r"

Inverted diverticula appeared as broad-based, smooth, sessile polyps measuring 1.5-2.0 cm. In five of the six patients a characteristic central umbilication and/or evidence of barium within the polyp could be identified. The diagnosis was confirmed in three patients by demonstrating an everted diverticulum replacing the suspected lesion. In the remaining three patients, two of whom had normal findings on colonoscopy, the diagnosis was strongly suggested by the presence of barium extending into the substance of the mass. Additional radiologic maneuvers or a second study may permit accurate diagnosis if the possibility of inverted diverticulum is considered. However, even when the diverticulum cannot be demonstrated, a central umbilication or barium within a smooth intraluminal projection should suggest inverted diverticulum and prevent unnecessary endoscopy or inadvertent diverticulectomy.\r"

Our discussion and illustrations are based on a retrospective review of approximately 1300 ERCP studies performed at a single center during a 2-year period.\r"

CT examinations of all 11 cases showed nonenhancing hypodense subcapsular areas with irregular contours in the liver. Major vessels were free of obstruction. Anatomic correlation, possible in one case, confirmed the diagnosis. Size disproportion between the graft and the recipient abdominal cavity reduced hepatic blood flow and caused abnormal pressure points. One or both of these factors could result in ischemia in subcapsular areas and explain the subcapsular necrosis. Although it has good prognosis without treatment, subcapsular hepatic necrosis is important to recognize to avoid confusion with liver necrosis after vascular thrombosis.\r"

Endocrine and radiation therapy will influence the size and signal intensity of the seminal vesicles. The purpose of the essay is to illustrate the spectrum of seminal vesicle disease, including congenital anomalies, inflammation, and neoplastic disease. Although MR imaging is helpful in depicting seminal vesicle abnormalities, it does not allow differentiation of benign from malignant disease, distinction of hemorrhage due to tumor invasion from postbiopsy changes, or distinguishing between glandular obstruction due to tumor infiltration and mechanical compression.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enhance contractile function of myocardium \"stunned\" by a brief episode of coronary artery occlusion, yet their mechanism(s) of action remain unresolved. In addition to possible hemodynamic effects, ACE inhibitors may stimulate the synthesis of cardioprotective prostaglandins. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors that contain a sulfhydryl group may be due in part to the ability of thiol compounds to act as nonspecific antioxidants or direct scavengers of cytotoxic oxygen-derived free radicals. To investigate this question we compared the effects of (1) the sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor zofenopril, (2) the sulfhydryl-containing stereoisomer of captopril (SQ 14,534) with essentially no ACE inhibitor properties, (3) the nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor enalaprilat, and (4) solvent alone, given at the time of reperfusion, on recovery of contractile function after 15 minutes of coronary occlusion in the anesthetized open-chest dog. Segment shortening in control animals remained depressed or \"stunned\" after reperfusion, recovering to only -5 +/- 12% of baseline preocclusion values at 3 hours after reperfusion. In contrast, all three treatment agents attenuated postischemic dysfunction: segment shortening was restored to 33 +/- 12%, 54 +/- 6%, and 83 +/- 5% of baseline values at 3 hours after reflow in dogs treated with SQ 14,534 (p less than 0.05), zofenopril (p less than 0.01), and enalaprilat (p less than 0.01), respectively (all vs control value). These improvements in segment shortening did not appear to be the result of altered oxygen supply or demand after reperfusion, inasmuch as no significant differences in systemic hemodynamic parameters or myocardial blood flow were observed among the groups. In the second phase of the study, we found that the improved contractile function associated with enalaprilat treatment could largely be reversed by infusion of the potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin: segment shortening was reduced from 69 +/- 12% at 2 hours after treatment/reperfusion to 38 +/- 12% at 2 hours after indomethacin infusion (p less than 0.01 vs 2 hours after reperfusion). Infusion of indomethacin had no effect, however, on the improved contractile function associated with zofenopril treatment. We therefore conclude that sulfhydryl- versus nonsulfhydryl-containing agents enhance contractile function of stunned myocardium by different mechanisms of action: enalaprilat attenuates postischemic dysfunction at least in part by a prostaglandin-mediated mechanism, whereas the salutary effects of zofenopril and SQ 14,534 may be due in part to the antioxidant properties of the sulfhydryl moiety.\r"

All animals underwent five 5 minute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusions with a final 5-hour reperfusion period. Dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups determined by the duration of reperfusion (5, 10, or 15 minutes) between successive 5-minute occlusion periods. A shortening of the duration of the reperfusion period between occlusions led to reduced recovery and progressive deterioration in systolic shortening after multiple occlusion-reperfusion sequences. With 15-minute reperfusion periods, the percentage of segment shortening (%SS) during the first through fourth reperfusion periods ranged from 17.1 +/- 2.6% to 18.2 +/- 1.8% and did not differ from the preocclusion control value (18.8 +/- 1.7%) by the end of the final reperfusion period. In contrast, in those dogs with 5-minute reperfusion periods, %SS was significantly reduced from the preocclusion control value (20.2 +/- 2.2%) at the completion of the final 5-hour reperfusion period (11.4 +/- 1.5%). Results of the present study indicate that after only a few brief periods of coronary artery occlusion, rapid and cumulative deterioration in regional contractile function can occur when the duration of intermittent reperfusion is sufficiently brief.\r"

In comparison with vehicle-treated control dogs, those given dipyridamole (20 and 40 micrograms/kg/min, respectively) 15 minutes before and during coronary occlusion had a greater depression of regional segment shortening (38 +/- 7% and 19 +/- 4%, respectively, vs control levels of 69 +/- 10% of preocclusion values) during acute coronary artery occlusion. After a 5-hour reperfusion period, segment shortening returned to preocclusion values in the control group but remained decreased in the dipyridamole groups (87 +/- 4% and 75%, respectively). These results suggest that dipyridamole in a dose-dependent manner exacerbates recovery of contractility of postischemic reperfused myocardium in dogs with well-developed coronary collateral circulation.\r"

Doppler echocardiography and ECG monitoring were performed continuously before, during, and after balloon occlusion in the drug-free state and during esmolol infusion. Fourteen of the 16 patients had ST segment elevation during balloon inflation. However, maximal ST segment elevation (2.1 +/- 1.5 mm vs 1.7 +/- 1.3 mm, p less than 0.001) and duration of ST segment elevation (68 +/- 20 seconds vs 54 +/- 19 seconds, p less than 0.05) were both significantly reduced during esmolol infusion. Furthermore, the decrease in ejection fraction seen during drug-free balloon occlusions was significantly blunted during esmolol infusion. In the baseline state ejection fraction decreased from 55% to 38% (p less than 0.05) during coronary occlusion compared with a decrease from 52% to 49% (p = NS) during esmolol infusion. In addition, esmolol appeared to delay the onset of segmental wall motion abnormalities after coronary occlusion, occurring at a mean of 40 seconds after balloon inflation versus a mean of 31 seconds in the absence of beta blockade (p less than 0.05). Thus the use of ultrashort-acting beta blockade appears to diminish the extent and delay the onset of myocardial ischemia during acute coronary occlusion.\r"

A secondary aim of the study was to determine whether the addition of isometric handgrip exercises to the standard dipyridamole imaging protocol increased the frequency of wall-motion abnormalities or thallium redistribution. Echocardiograms and thallium scans were independently interpreted, and wall-motion abnormalities that appeared with dipyridamole, handgrip exercise, or both were compared with results of thallium imaging. Five of 24 patients with thallium redistribution had new wall-motion abnormalities, and the extent (number of segments) of thallium redistribution in these five patients was significantly greater than in those who did not have well-motion abnormalities (p less than 0.03). The addition of isometric handgrip exercises to the imaging protocol did not distinguish between patients with and without new wall-motion abnormalities or thallium redistribution. Thus new wall-motion abnormalities infrequently accompany thallium redistribution in routine dipyridamole stress testing in spite of the addition of handgrip exercises, but when new wall-motion abnormalities are present, they are associated with a greater area of thallium redistribution.\r"

We then compared the KPS score with other predictors of prognosis in these patients. In patients who presented with acute myocardial infarction, a lower KPS score (less than 8 on a scale of 1 to 10) 3 weeks before the index infarction was associated with a higher incidence of congestive heart failure, in-hospital cardiac arrest, and mortality during hospitalization, as compared with patients with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (each p less than 0.001). Cumulative 1-year and 4-year mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with KPS scores less than 8, as compared with patients with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (42.5% vs. 12.6% at 1 year and 61.6% vs 25.1% at 4 years, respectively; both p less than 0.001). The left ventricular ejection fraction on admission was significantly lower in patients with KPS scores less than 8, as compared with those with KPS scores greater than or equal to 8 (p less than 0.019). The cumulative mortality rate was equally well predicted by low KPS score and by left ventricular ejection fraction (both p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report our experience with 46 stents (Wallstent, Medinvent, Lausanne, Switzerland) implanted in 35 lesions of 24 consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, range 43 to 75). Two overlapping stents were implanted in seven patients, and three overlapping stents were positioned in two. After implantation, activated partial thromboplastin time was maintained at two to three times the control level by intravenous administration of heparin (160 to 550 mg daily) until thrombotest values were reduced 5% to 10% by acenocoumarol. Impending thrombotic occlusion was recognized in two suboptimally anticoagulated patients: patient A after implantation of four stents and patient B after anticoagulation therapy was discontinued because of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed successfully in both patients. A third patient had a myocardial infarction on day 7 after stent implantation, in spite of adequate anticoagulation and optimal medical drug therapy. It is concluded that stringent anticoagulation therapy appears mandatory to maintain graft patency after stent implantation.\r"

Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the contribution of these agents to depression at 3 to 4 months, controlling for medical and sociodemographic factors as well as for baseline depression. Treatment with digitalis predicted depression at 3 to 4 months (p less than 0.05); no other medications, including beta-blockers, predicted depression (p greater than 0.10).

Seventy-seven patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and an abnormal left ventricular response to exercise were studied by means of gated blood pool imaging. The arteriographic and functional parameters of 24 patients with angina during exercise testing imaging. The arteriographic and functional parameters of 24 patients with angina during exercise testing were compared with those of 53 patients who were pain free at the time of the test. Both groups were similar with regard to rate of multivessel disease (50% vs 51%, p = NS) and prior myocardial infarction (46% vs 51%, p = NS), as well as age, sex, and history of angina. Mean global ejection fraction remained unchanged (but abnormal) in both groups of patients during exercise. Furthermore, evidence of new regional asynergy during exercise assessed by a five-point scoring system was found to be equally abnormal in the two groups. Results of this study suggest that the severity of exercise-induced global and regional left ventricular dysfunction is independent of the presence of absence of angina during exercise testing.\r"

Forty-nine patients had pericarditis (detection of pericardial rub by careful auscultation), and 36 patients had echocardiographically demonstrated hydropericardium (presence of pericardial effusion without pericardial rub). During the first 3 days after admission, transient episodes of atrial fibrillation were observed in 10 patients (20%) with pericarditis (group 1), 15 patients (42%) with hydropericardium (group 2), and 20 patients (14%) without pericarditis and hydropericardium (group 3). Although there was no significant difference in the incidence of atrial fibrillation between groups 1 and 3, patients in group 2 had a significantly higher incidence of atrial fibrillation than those in groups 1 and 3. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and the number of advanced asynergic segments were found to be the important factors discriminating the three groups by multivariate analysis. Therefore atrial fibrillation after acute Q wave anterior infarction was not related to the inflammatory infiltration involving the atria but to the increase in atrial pressure resulting from hemodynamic change caused by more extensive myocardial damage.\r"

Standard ECG and long-term ECG monitoring and invasive electrophysiologic testing were carried out in 10 patients who required this drug for neurologic disorders, but in whom its safe use had been questioned because of symptoms of ECG abnormalities. We observed depression of sinus node function and an atrioventricular conduction delay with a significant prolongation of the PQ interval of 16 msec (9%; 95% confidence interval: 1.9% to 16.5%; p less than 0.05), of which the HV interval was significantly prolonged but not the PA and AH intervals. These effects are in accordance with previously shown class 1A properties. However, the lack of effects on QRS, JT, and QT intervals at normal heart rates is a class 1B characteristic. Thus carbamazepine seems to have composite electropharmacologic actions. A cause effect relationship between carbamazepine treatment and significant arrhythmias was established in five patients. Thus the negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects of carbamazepine may, at least in predisposed patients, induce symptoms confusingly similar to the epileptic seizures it is used to prevent.\r"

We also examined the rate-dependent effect of d-sotalol at 37 degrees and 27 degrees C. Before the addition of d-sotalol, reducing the temperature from 37 degrees to 27 degrees C increased the action potential duration recorded at 50% repolarization (APD50) from 112 +/- 7 msec to 271 +/- 15 msec and action potential duration recorded at 90% repolarization (APD90) from 136 +/- 7 msec to 325 +/- 10 msec. d-Sotalol (50 mumol/L) lengthened APD50 and APD90 to a greater degree at low temperatures. Thus at 37 degrees C d-sotalol lengthened APD50 and APD90 by 12 +/- 6 msec and 19 +/- 5 msec, and at 27 degrees C by 37 +/- 5 msec and 52 +/- 7 msec, respectively. d-Sotalol produced its greatest effect on APD at long pacing cycle lengths, thus demonstrating reverse dependence. This rate-dependent effect was more marked at 27 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. The greater effect of d-sotalol on APD at long pacing cycle lengths may be explained by the modulated receptor hypothesis, assuming that the drug has a higher affinity for closed potassium channels. Such a mechanism may also explain the accentuated class III antiarrhythmic action of d-sotalol observed during hypothermia.\r"

This new agent prolonged the PR interval and QRS duration but did not alter the QT interval or the corrected QT interval. It did not alter the sinus cycle length or sinus node recovery time. The drug prolonged the AH interval, HV interval, and intraatrial conduction time but did not change the effective refractory periods of the right atrium or right ventricle. SUN1165 prevented the induction of tachycardia in six of nine patients with AVRT by a complete retrograde block of the accessory pathway and prevented AVNRT in four of five patients by a complete retrograde block of the fast atrioventricular nodal pathway as well. We conclude that SUN1165 is very effective in preventing AVRT or AVNRT. Larger studies with more patients are warranted.\r"

The locations of the accessory pathways were determined by epicardial mapping during surgery in 34 patients and by multicatheter endocavitary electrophysiologic studies in eight additional patients. During delta wave inscription, the shape and extension of areas of the negative and positive potentials on the thorax correlated better with the preexcitation site (69% of patients) than with the localization of the minimum potential alone (45.2% of patients). Typical potential distributions were present from the beginning of the delta wave and remained stationary during the first half of the QRS complex. During marked preexcitation, the superposition of atrial activity on the delta wave produced a mixed pattern in the earliest maps. However, these alterations of early delta thoracic potential distribution did not persist longer than 30 msec. The spread of the negative potentials during the last half of the QRS complex also characterized each localization: right-sided preexcitation reproduced the depolarization sequence of left bundle branch block, left-sided preexcitation reproduced that of right bundle branch block, and posterior pathways resembled left anterior fascicular block. Anterior left ventricular and more anterior left lateral ventricular preexcitations mimicked a right bundle branch block-left posterior fascicular block pattern. There was good correlation between the body surface potential map obtained during the ST segment and the site of the right-sided preexcitation. However, in left-sided preexcitations, ST patterns concordant with delta wave patterns were found less frequently than in right-sided preexcitations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Careful determination of pulse wave velocity is important in the study of arterial viscoelastic properties, wave reflections, and ventricular-arterial interactions. In spite of its increasingly widespread use, there is as yet no standardized method for its determination. Most studies have manually identified the transit time of the pressure wave front as it travels over a known distance in the arterial system, but the issues of accuracy and reproducibility have not been addressed. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of four computerized algorithms in the determination of pulse wave velocities in invasive as well as in noninvasive pressure determinations. The four methods were the identification of: (1) the point of minimum diastolic pressure, (2) the point at which the first derivative of pressure is maximum, (3) the point at which the second derivative of pressure is maximum, and (4) the point yielded by the intersection of a line tangent to the initial systolic upstroke of the pressure tracing and a horizontal line through the minimum point. High-fidelity aortic pressure recordings were obtained in 26 patients with a multi-sensor micromanometer catheter. Noninvasive brachial and radial pressure waveforms were recorded in 11 volunteers with external piezoelectric transducers. The results show that the first derivative method consistently provided results that were different from the other methods for both the invasive and noninvasive methods because of changes in the structure of the upstroke as the arterial pulse propagates distally. Although the minimum method worked well for the invasive determinations, it was erratic with the noninvasive determinations, probably because of the higher amount of noise and reflection in the latter. Among the four algorithms, the second derivative and the intersecting tangents methods worked well with both invasive and noninvasive determinations with mean variation coefficients of less than 7% and correlation coefficients between the methods of greater than 0.90 for all data. In conclusion, computerized algorithms allow accurate determination of pulse wave velocity in invasively and noninvasively measured arterial pressure waveforms.\r"

All patients were receiving digitalis and/or diuretics and had left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 45. Exercise tests were performed after 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Enoximone produced significantly greater increases in exercise time than placebo treatment at weeks 4 and 8 (p = 0.012, p = 0.029, respectively) but not after 12 weeks. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly after the first dose of enoximone but not after 12 weeks of long-term therapy. Heart failure symptoms and the physicians' evaluations of cardiac status were significantly improved in both enoximone therapy groups during the first 4 weeks of evaluation when compared with evaluations of cardiac status in the placebo group. Diuretic doses were increased more frequently for patients who were receiving a placebo. Adverse events were reported with similar frequency in the placebo and 50 mg enoximone treatment groups; 100 mg enoximone resulted in a significantly greater incidence of adverse events. Mean heart rate and ventricular ectopic activity were not significantly different among the three treatment limbs. Enoximone appears to improve exercise tolerance, ventricular function, and symptoms of heart failure for 4 to 8 weeks. Heart rate, ventricular ectopic activity, and mortality rate were not increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As an index of contractility, the linear slope k of the end-systolic pressure/dimension relationship during afterload increase with angiotensin II was determined by M-mode echocardiography in 34 heart transplant recipients and 20 healthy control subjects. Baseline findings for end-systolic diameter and systolic blood pressure were normal and similar in both groups, but the transplanted hearts performed at a significantly lower end-systolic wall stress (40.4 +/- 12 gm/cm2 vs 49.9 +/- 11 gm/cm2, p less than 0.001). Comparable increase of afterload was achieved in heart transplant recipients with significantly (p less than 0.001) less angiotensin II, which indicates increased vasoconstrictor sensitivity.  Contractility index k did not differ between heart transplant recipients (12.95 +/- 4.9 mm/100 mm Hg) and control subjects (12.78 +/- 2.8 mm/100 mm Hg). This finding is consistent with a normal contractility of the transplanted, denervated human heart. Normal baseline contractility therefore is an intrinsic property of the intact heart, which is independent of autonomic neural control. Contractility was not compromised by increasing interval from transplantation or the presence of mild acute rejection or mild interstitial fibrosis. Mildly impaired contractility (k greater than 2 SD of k in control subjects) in four heart transplant recipients (12%) was neither associated with structural myocardial or coronary changes nor with rejection episodes or graft ischemic time. One may speculate that impaired contractility, which is present in a minority of heart transplant recipients, results from pretransplantation damage.\r"

  ".W": "Fourteen fetuses with atrioventricular canal malformations were examined by two-dimensional echocardiography, pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography, and color Doppler flow mapping. Eleven fetuses had complete and three fetuses had partial atrioventricular canal malformations. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis was associated with six cases, and fetal arrhythmia was seen in three cases. With two-dimensional echocardiography, the atrioventricular canal malformations could be diagnosed accurately. The inclusion of color Doppler flow mapping, however, provided additional hemodynamic information that was important from the prognostic point of view. Incompetence of atrioventricular valves could be demonstrated in 10 of 14 cases by Doppler echocardiography. In nine cases, detailed Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of the regurgitation jet was possible. The proportion of systolic time during which atrioventricular valve insufficiency was demonstrated was related to the occurrence of nonimmune hydrops fetalis. When insufficiency of atrioventricular valves was associated with hydrops (four cases), a pansystolic insufficiency was always present. In cases without hydrops (five), regurgitation was confined to early systole. Thus a reliable method for semiquantitative evaluation of the degree of insufficiency seems to have been found. Moreover, an association appeared to exist between the occurrence of hydrops fetalis and the proportion of atrial area that was taken up by regurgitant jet area, as determined by planimetry in the four-chamber view. Prenatal diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy or neonatal cardiac evaluation. Only one neonate survived in our series. Two were stillborn, four died during the neonatal period, two died during infancy, and pregnancy was electively terminated prematurely in five cases. Eight fetuses were found to have a karyotypic abnormality.\r"

Eight patients were found to have cardiac abnormalities including tricuspid valve insufficiency, tricuspid stenosis and insufficiency, and the catheter passing through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. These findings demonstrate that tricuspid valvular lesions are frequent in patients with ventriculoatrial shunts, and that periodic echocardiographic evaluation should be performed routinely.\r"

Two forms of sinus parasystole are described: (1) an active form, where both the dominant and the parasystolic pacemakers are located within the sinus node and (2) a passive form, where the basic rhythm is ectopic and the sinus pacemaker is protected as a result of complete retrograde SA block. Three cases of sinus parasystole are analyzed. In the active form of the arrhythmia the parasystolic sinus P waves are identical to those of the basic sinus rhythm. The diagnosis is suggested by variably coupled premature sinus P waves occurring with mathematically related intervals. This relationship between the parasystolic intervals can not be precise whenever complicating factors such as modulation occur. The recognition of active sinus parasystole is difficult, since the parasystolic P waves do not differ from basic P waves, so that the pattern resembles that of sinus arrhythmia or sinus extrasystoles. The passive form of sinus parasystole is more easily recognized due to the clear-cut difference between the dominant ectopic atrial waves and the \"parasystolic\" sinus P waves, which manifest with variable coupling intervals and reflect mathematically related intervals in between.\r"

Magnesium acts as a metallic cofactor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions; notably it is essential for all reactions requiring ATP. Magnesium also functions as a transmembrane and intracellular modulator of other ions. Altered magnesium homeostasis, particularly a deficiency, can cause alterations in metabolic functions that result in clinically recognizable events. Recognition of magnesium deficiency is problematic, since there is no test that will reliably and consistently detect this condition. A high index of suspicion for magnesium deficiency is necessary and treatment should be given when indicated. This article reviews the molecular and cellular actions of magnesium and correlates these basic scientific findings with clinically recognized cardiovascular events in humans. In addition, management guidelines are delineated.\r"
