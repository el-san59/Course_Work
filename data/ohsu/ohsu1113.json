  ".W": "Different analyses of genetic polymorphisms performed on the Basque population have suggested a possible heterogeneity of the Basques and a singularity of their genetic characteristics. In this paper, both aspects are analyzed by means of the genetic study of seven polymorphic systems--ACP, ADA, AK, ESD, PGD, GC, and HP--in 854 autochthonous individuals from the province of Vizcaya. The individuals were classified as being from the regions of Arratia, Guernica, Durango, Uribe, Marquina, Lea, and Bilbao, on the basis of the birthplaces of their four grandparents. Analyses for heterogeneity of the gene frequencies distribution suggest that there is a moderate genetic heterogeneity, probably produced by centuries of geographical and administrative isolation of these regions. The comparison with caucasoid populations, performed using the principal components analysis and Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards arc distance, indicates that the subpopulations of the province of Vizcaya have experienced little genetic exchange with other caucasoids and that the distribution of their genetic frequencies differentiates them from other populations.\r"

The usable return rate was 59.6% (337/565) of the full membership. One hundred eighty (54.4%) respondents indicated a need for a doctoral degree in genetic counseling, 101 (30.5%) were undecided as to the need, and 50 (15.1%) did not see a need for such a degree. One hundred forty-seven (44.3%) respondents indicated their individual interest in pursuing a doctorate in genetic counseling, 109 (32.8%) would not pursue such a degree, and 76 (22.9%) were undecided. Beyond the generally accepted feeling that genetic counseling should expand as a professional field, the reasons cited most often for seeking the Ph.D. in genetic counseling were professional recognition, a desire to specialize in a particular area, and greater depth of knowledge. The study revealed a strongly positive attitude, among full members of the NSGC, toward establishment of a doctoral degree in genetic counseling.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic studies have shown that insulin is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Clinical studies have also demonstrated positive correlations between insulin and blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor. Moreover, there is an inverse correlation between insulin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). These studies have provided evidence in support of the biologic plausibility of epidemiologic observations, but they have not clearly established insulin's role in the pathogenesis of human cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as hypertension. In fact, there is considerable evidence that insulin resistance (abnormal nonoxidative glucose disposal), not hyperinsulinemia, is the primary insulin-related abnormality in human hypertension, and that hyperinsulinemia occurs as a response to insulin resistance. Skeletal muscle appears to be the primary site of insulin resistance in essential hypertension, although other organs, such as the kidneys and liver--key sites for cell and water homeostasis and lipoprotein regulation, respectively--may respond normally to insulin. Adipocytes also appear to be a site of insulin resistance. Thus, the putative interrelationship between hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, on the one hand, and with blood pressure and lipoproteins, on the other, is a complex one and may involve organ-specific insulin resistance. Altered cation transport is one of several mechanisms by which insulin resistance might raise blood pressure. The Na+, K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase pumps are insulin sensitive. Thus, when insulin resistance is present, the activity of these pumps in the smooth muscle of the arterial wall might be reduced. This would lead to an intracellular accumulation of sodium and calcium, thereby sensitizing the vascular wall to pressor substances. Moreover, secondary hyperinsulinemia will occur, and insulin has been shown to stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity and to increase renal tubular absorption of sodium. Insulin is also a growth factor and therefore might have a trophic effect on the vessel wall, one that could initiate and/or sustain hypertension as well as atherosclerosis. Abnormal lipoprotein metabolism is yet another possible explanation for the accelerated atherosclerosis that has been observed in persons with abnormal carbohydrate tolerance and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance both play a role in the expression of elevated very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels as well as in the depression of HDL levels. Coronary risk reduction has been disappointing when blood pressure has been lowered with treatment regimens based on thiazide diuretics and/or beta blockers. Thiazides and some beta blockers may further impair tissue insulin sensitivity and often cause blood lipoprotein abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Blood pressure declined significantly--from 148/95 mm Hg at baseline to 139/84 after titration and 135/86 after maintenance--with transdermal clonidine (n = 29), and from 156/96 to 144/85 and 148/88, respectively, with verapamil-SR (n = 29). Adverse event rates and quality-of-life questionnaire responses were similar in the two treatment groups. Transdermal clonidine was worn as directed during more than 96% of patient-weeks of treatment. Compliance with the oral verapamil regimen was less consistent: Verapamil-SR was taken as directed during approximately 50% of patient-weeks of therapy, and individual compliance, assessed by tablet counts, varied from 50-120%. In all, 86% of subjects were satisfied or highly satisfied with the convenience of transdermal therapy; 87% reported that side effects were slightly or not bothersome; 65% indicated that transdermal patches were more convenient than oral therapy; and almost 60% preferred transdermal to oral therapy. In this study transdermal clonidine and oral verapamil were equally safe and effective. A substantial majority of patients preferred transdermal to oral therapy, and adherence to treatment was greater with transdermal therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In minorities, as in the general population, hypertension is taken seriously because it is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Until recently, our understanding of the role that hypertension plays in the heart disease seen in minorities has been limited by a paucity of prospective data regarding the prevalence, natural history, and pathophysiology of the disease process in minority populations. In the last few years large-scale epidemiologic studies and well-controlled clinical studies alike have confirmed usually high rates of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality in minorities, particularly blacks and Hispanics. The severity of end-organ damage, both cardiac and renal, that is seen in these patients--especially when coupled with the severe cerebrovascular damage that is also more common in black and Hispanic hypertensives--mandate that more effective public health measures be taken to reduce the incidence of hypertension in these patient populations. Because hypertension is usually without significant clinical symptoms, noncompliance with drug therapy and high dropout rates are common in all patient populations. They are strikingly higher in inner-city populations, however, where illiteracy, poverty, homelessness, and high rates of chemical dependency combine to exacerbate an already serious problem in treating hypertensive patients. Inner-city patients are, increasingly, black and Hispanic patients, and these patients are more likely to be underinsured or uninsured, to be functionally illiterate in English, to be disinclined to seek health care, and to be less capable of following a prescribed regimen than the populace as a whole. The nature of the therapeutic regimen itself is probably the most important determinant of compliance, and compliance with drug therapy will be improved if the clinic chooses a simplified drug regimen and avoids drugs that produce intolerable side effects. Once-a-day--or, with transdermal clonidine, one-a-week--single-drug therapy may not be possible in all patients, but multiple drug therapy and multiple daily dosing schedules should be avoided wherever possible.\r"

  ".W": "Because hypertension is a \"silent\" disease process, compliance with therapy is always a problem. In the inner city, where socioeconomic factors such as poverty, illiteracy, and substance abuse raise additional barriers to effective health care, poor compliance with antihypertensive regimens can reach epidemic proportions--as it did in our clinic in the early 1970s. After identifying the major causes of poor compliance in our patients, we instituted measures that led directly to greatly improved compliance and control, among them the expansion of clinic hours, the expediting of laboratory services, and the training of nurse-therapists to assume many of the responsibilities of running the clinic. In recent years a number of new antihypertensive agents have been introduced, and these new drugs have afforded patients better blood pressure control through less complex drug regimens with fewer serious side effects. Indeed, we observed a strong correlation between patient compliance and the administration of agents with longer dosing intervals and improved side effects profiles. This observation led us to consider whether transdermal clonidine--which requires weekly, rather than daily, administration--might not be an especially effective means of controlling blood pressure in inner-city patients. To test this hypothesis, we enrolled 20 patients, all of them blacks, in a pilot study of this unique delivery system. Blood pressure was adequately controlled in all 18 patients who completed the study, and patients were uniformly enthusiastic about this alternative to daily dosing. As a result, compliance with this mode of therapy was excellent.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension is now seen as a broader condition than high blood pressure alone. Large-scale epidemiologic studies have established that high blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have shown an inconsistent reduction in major cardiovascular endpoints. Importantly, the incidence of coronary disease has been reduced to only a small extent, suggesting that factors beyond high blood pressure are important in the genesis of atherosclerotic disease in hypertensive patients. It is evident, for example, that patients with hypertension have an exaggerated vulnerability to the consequences of lipid abnormalities. Moreover, it has recently been established that hypertension is characterized by insulin resistance and altered glucose tolerance. As a result, high plasma concentrations of insulin produce proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle and connective tissue, and they may adversely affect the lipid profile. The left ventricle is also involved in hypertension--independent of blood pressure. There is growing evidence that there are increases in the muscle mass of the left ventricle and changes in its diastolic filling characteristics at the very early stages of hypertension. The arterial circulation is similarly involved, for alterations in structure or function, reflected by diminished arterial compliance, can be demonstrated prior to the appearance of clinical hypertension. Treatment designed to protect hypertensive patients from cardiovascular events must not only be based on blood pressure, but must take into account all the components of the hypertension syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Although therapy with transdermal clonidine is effective in bringing elevated blood pressure under control, this mode of delivery has been associated with localized dermal reactions in a small percentage of patients. Because anecdotal information suggests that a number of physicians have resorted to various dermal pretreatment strategies in an effort to alleviate or eliminate these dermal reactions, we decided to investigate the two most commonly used pretreatment strategies, to determine if they affected the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of transdermally administered clonidine. Specifically, we examined the effect of dermal pretreatment with 0.5% hydrocortisone cream and with an over-the-counter antacid, magnesium-aluminum hydroxide suspension, on the pharmacokinetics of transdermal clonidine in 10 adult hypertensive males. Patients were randomized to receive one of the two pretreatment regimens or therapy with the patch alone, and after 7 days of treatment and a 14-day washout period, patients were crossed over to receive one of the other therapies. All patients ultimately received all three therapies. We present here the results from the 10 patients enrolled in our study. Our study found a statistical difference detected in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), steady-state plasma concentration (Css), and apparent clonidine dose delivered (Doseapp) following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone compared with the transdermal patch alone. The mean +/- SD relative extents of absorption (Frel) of clonidine following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone and magnesium-aluminum hydroxide in respect to the transdermal patch alone were 94.84 +/- 45.69% and 97.65 +/- 59.65%, respectively. No significant difference was detected in this parameter. Supine and sitting blood pressures and pulse rates were similar during treatment with clonidine alone, following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone cream, and following pretreatment with magnesium-aluminum hydroxide suspension. In addition, systemic side effects were evenly distributed among treatments. However, dermal side effects were less frequent following pretreatment with hydrocortisone compared with magnesium-aluminum hydroxide and the patch alone. The results of this study suggest that dermal pretreatment with 0.5 percent hydrocortisone cream may significantly alter the plasma concentrations of transdermally administered clonidine without adversely altering the pharmacodynamics.\r"

In studies with angiographic end points, marked lowering of total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol with comparable increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol retards the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and favors regression. In the Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS), such therapy also prevented the appearance and worsening of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary bypass grafts. In the recently reported Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS), in which coronary lesions were measured quantitatively, treatment induced clear regression of coronary atherosclerosis and also markedly decreased coronary events. The beneficial effect on coronary lesions in these studies appears to be proportional to the degree of lipid lowering. In addition, new evidence suggests that aspirin and calcium antagonists might prevent the development of early coronary lesions. The identification and aggressive treatment of patients with high serum cholesterol levels can have a major impact on the development and evolution of coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "In the multicenter, double-blind EXCEL (Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin) study the efficacy of lovastatin in modifying plasma lipids and lipoproteins in 8,245 participants with moderate primary hypercholesterolemia was evaluated. Patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of treatment with diet and placebo or diet and lovastatin 20 or 40 mg once a day, or 20 or 40 mg twice a day. At all of these dosages, lovastatin produced substantial dose-dependent reductions in low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels, averaging 24% (20 mg/day) to 40% (80 mg/day). The magnitude of the effect of this lipoprotein was further reflected by the percentage of patients who achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) goals. In the absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or two other CAD risk factors, the LDL-cholesterol goal of 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) was attained by 22% of patients in the placebo group and between 81% (20 mg/day) and 96% (80 mg/day) of those treated with lovastatin. For those with CAD or at least two other CAD risk factors, the LDL-cholesterol goal of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) was attained by 4% of placebo patients and between 38% (20 mg/day) and 83% (80 mg/day) of those treated with lovastatin. Lovastatin also increased high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (7-10%) and decreased triglycerides (10-19%) in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, when used as an adjunct to a prudent diet, lovastatin produces favorable changes in the entire lipoprotein profile and is a highly effective agent for managing patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.\r"

  ".W": "This randomized, double-blind, multicenter, diet-and-placebo-controlled study was designed to clarify the dose-response relationship of lovastatin therapy to lipid-modifying efficacy and drug-related adverse events. Exclusion criteria were minimized so that study patients were representative of the majority of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia seen in medical practice. After 6 weeks on the American Heart Association Step 1 Diet, a total of 8,245 patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of treatment with diet and placebo or lovastatin at dosages of 20 or 40 mg once a day or 20 or 40 mg twice a day. All adverse events were monitored, with particular attention to evaluation of liver and muscle. Liver transaminase elevations suggestive of possible hepatotoxicity, defined as successive elevations in either aspartate transaminase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, occurred in equal numbers of placebo and lovastatin 20 mg/day treated patients (0.1%). The frequencies were higher in lovastatin 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day patient groups (0.9 and 1.5%, respectively). No patient was diagnosed as having clinically symptomatic hepatic dysfunction. Creatinine kinase (CK) elevations above the upper limit of normal occurred frequently in placebo- (29%), as well as lovastatin-treated patients (29-35%), and muscle symptoms were reported with similar frequency in all groups (7-9%). The combination of muscle symptoms with marked CK elevations (greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) was seen in only five patients: one in a 40 mg/day dose group and four in the 80 mg/day dose group. No patient developed rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events requiring discontinuation was 6% for the placebo group and from 7% (20 mg/day) to 9% (80 mg/day) for lovastatin treatment groups. No new types of adverse experiences related to lovastatin treatment were reported. Lovastatin, as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated LDL cholesterol, was generally very well tolerated.\r"

  ".U": "91328194\r", 
  ".W": "The major components of atherosclerotic plaque, ultimately responsible for clinical effects, are deposited lipids--mostly cholesteryl esters and cholesterol, derived largely from the lower-density lipoproteins of the blood--and proliferated, modified arterial smooth muscle cells with their synthesized connective tissue products. Advanced plaques vary widely in the proportion of the two components, but evidence indicates that lipid deposition--especially of lipoprotein elements--often occurs in the lesion-prone intimal areas of the artery prior to the buildup of smooth muscle cells. The 1980s were remarkably productive for investigators who study the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We now know of the many forms of lower-density lipoproteins, i.e., low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), some of which are more likely to be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and some of which are more likely to be influenced by diet. Among these forms of LDL and VLDL are LDL-1, beta-VLDL, and Lp(a). Work has been reported implicating various alterations of endothelial function in the permeability of the arterial endothelial barrier in the transport of these low-density, cholesterol-rich macromolecules. Of possibly greater interest is the developing evidence that such proliferation-stimulating molecules as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can be produced by a number of cells likely to be involved in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition to platelets, these include activated monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, injured endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, which can undergo an autocrine conversion to PDGF synthesis--possibly stimulated by LDL from hyperlipidemic serum. Leukotrienes and other endothelium-associated regulatory molecules may also take part in the paracrine and autocrine mechanisms of stimulating smooth-muscle-cell proliferation. Additional recent developments that have led to a better understanding of atherosclerotic pathogenesis have occurred. The first is evidence of the involvement of oxidized LDL and its apolipoprotein B in atherogenesis. Research indicates that antioxidants have a suppressive effect on atherogenesis when oxidized LDL has been involved in lesion development. The data linking the development of autoimmune reactions to these oxidatively altered lipoproteins are also impressive. Further, there is increasing evidence that atherogenesis in nonhuman primates and in people in whom chronic sustained circulating immune complexes are involved is likely to be accelerated, even when few or no classic risk factors are present. These lesions appear to represent a distinct microarchitectural form of concentric and transmural atherosclerosis that is better classified as \"atheroarteritis.\"\r"

  ".W": "Based on substantial evidence, the 1984 NIH Consensus Development Conference concluded that the treatment of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol elevations with diet and, when necessary, with drugs, can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, in 1988 the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) published guidelines for defining moderate-, borderline-high-, and high-risk categories for CAD. Many clinical trials have supported the benefits of antihyperlipidemic therapy. Evidence from the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial gave rise to the \"2:1 ratio,\" i.e., that a 1% reduction in total cholesterol level is associated with a 2% decrease in CAD events. The Helsinki Heart Study results indicated that additional benefit may be obtained by raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Dramatic reductions in LDL and total cholesterol were achieved by the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias, which also achieved a 35% reduction in CAD events and a two-thirds reduction in both coronary bypass operations and angioplasties. Long-term benefits of cholesterol lowering in terms of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality have been shown in the Coronary Drug Project and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. Two major studies that have documented angiographic changes as a result of cholesterol lowering are the Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) and the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS). In both CLAS and FATS, there was a decrease in the development of new lesions and a lowering of the rate of progression of existing lesions. In FATS, there was also evidence that aggressive antihyperlipidemic therapy will decrease existing lesions in some CAD patients.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate two methods for assessing the prevalence of alcohol abuse in hospitalized patients based upon scores on standardized alcoholism screening instruments compared with diagnostic discharge data, and to determine the risk for comorbid conditions in patients who abuse alcohol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 2,534 consecutive patients admitted to five adult inpatient services of an academic center, 1,964 were screened for alcohol abuse using the CAGE and the SMAST. Their discharge diagnoses were obtained and analyzed for the presence of alcohol-related diagnoses and other comorbid conditions. RESULTS: A total of 1.4% of patients had a principal alcohol-related diagnosis (ARD), 6% had a secondary but no principal ARD, and 15% screened positive for alcohol abuse but had no ARD. The overall prevalence of alcohol abuse was 22.4%. Patients with a principal ARD had a higher risk for dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pancreatitis, sequelae of liver disease, and illegal drug abuse. Patients with a secondary ARD were at risk for 19 comorbid conditions, including pancreatitis, injury, pneumonia, COPD, and poly-drug abuse. Patients who screened positive for alcohol abuse but had no ARD were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of hypertension, arrhythmia, breast cancer, or pelvic inflammatory disease. CONCLUSION: Discharge diagnoses alone markedly underestimate the prevalence of alcohol abuse in hospitalized patients. Patients from the three groups are at higher risk for comorbid conditions, and secondary prevention of alcohol abuse can be achieved by routinely screening every patient using recognized alcoholism screening instruments.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case series of 74 patients with AKA defined as a wide anion gap metabolic acidosis unexplained by any other disorder or toxin, including any patient with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. The setting was the Medical Emergency Department at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, a university-affiliated inner-city hospital. RESULTS: AKA is a common disorder in the emergency department, more common than previously thought. The acid-base abnormalities are more diverse than just a wide-gap metabolic acidosis and often include a concomitant metabolic alkalosis, hyperchloremic acidosis, or respiratory alkalosis. Lactic acidosis is also common. Semiquantitative serum acetoacetate levels were positive in 96% of patients. Elevated blood alcohol levels were present in two thirds of patients in whom alcohol levels were determined, and levels consistent with intoxication were seen in 40% of these patients. Electrolyte disorders including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia were common on presentation. The most common symptoms were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The most common physical findings were tachycardia, tachypnea, and abdominal tenderness. Altered mental status, fever, hypothermia, or other abnormal findings were uncommon and reflected other underlying processes. CONCLUSIONS: AKA is a common disorder in chronic malnourished alcoholic persons. The acid-base abnormalities reflect not only the ketoacidosis, but also associated extracellular fluid volume depletion, alcohol withdrawal, pain, sepsis, or severe liver disease. Although the pathophysiology is complex, the syndrome is rapidly reversible and has a low mortality.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: Pyomyositis, a common disease in the tropics, is rare in the continental United States, with approximately 83 cases described in the literature in the past two decades. The occurrence of pyomyositis complicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been reported in 10 patients since 1986. We report six cases of this entity in patients with advanced HIV disease seen in our institution over a 20-month period. A common denominator in all of our patients was muscle injury, induced by either exercise or trauma. Unlike most previous reports of HIV-associated pyomyositis, the clinical picture in our cases was complicated by the development of abscesses in multiple muscle groups, requiring prolonged antimicrobial therapy and repeated drainage procedures for successful management. Interestingly, one patient developed concomitant rhabdomyolysis--an otherwise rare event in classical pyomyositis. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant infecting organism in this as well as all other series. Of note, we also observed and report the first case, to our knowledge, of gram-negative pyomyositis in an HIV-infected individual. The pathogenic implications of this catalase-producing gram-negative isolate are discussed in the context of neutrophil abnormalities in HIV disease. CONCLUSION: Like tropical pyomyositis, its HIV-associated counterpart appears to be multifactorial in origin. Its recent recognition suggests that, in addition to underlying abnormalities of host defense, factors relating to the prolonged survival of patients with late-stage disease, including myopathy, might play an important contributory role.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appears to be useful in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy.\r"

Responses were observed in seven of nine patients in whom adequate doses of amphotericin B had failed and in all seven patients who had amphotericin B-related toxicities. In 12 patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy was continued without flare of the infection. Fluconazole was well tolerated with rare side effects.

DESIGN: (1) Biochemical evaluation of thiamine status in hospitalized patients with CHF treated with long-term furosemide and in age-matched control patients. (2) Uncontrolled trial of the effect of intravenous thiamine on cardiac performance in a subset of six patients with CHF. SETTING: General medical ward of a teaching community hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with chronic CHF receiving furosemide, and 16 age-matched control patients without heart failure and not taking diuretics. Daily furosemide doses were 80 to 240 mg, and duration of furosemide therapy was 3 to 14 months. Patients with identifiable causes of inadequate thiamine intake, absorption, or utilization or increased metabolic requirements were excluded. INTERVENTION: A 7-day course of intravenous thiamine, 100 mg twice daily, in six consenting patients with CHF. RESULTS: A high thiamine pyrophosphate effect (TPPE), indicating thiamine deficiency, was found in 21 of 23 furosemide-treated patients and in two of 16 controls (p less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SE) TPPE (normal: 0% to 15%) in furosemide-treated and control patients was 27.7 +/- 2.5% and 7.1 +/- 1.6%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Despite the high TPPE, the mean (+/- SE) urinary thiamine excretion in the furosemide-treated patients (n = 18) was inappropriately high (defined as greater than 130 micrograms/g creatinine), 410 +/- 95 micrograms/g creatinine, even in comparison with that in the controls (n = 14): 236 +/- 69 micrograms/g creatinine. In six patients treated with intravenous thiamine, the elevated TPPE decreased to normal, from a mean (+/- SE) of 27.0 +/- 3.8% to 4.5 +/- 1.3% (p less than 0.001), indicating normal thiamine utilization capacity. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased in four of five of these patients studied by echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that long-term furosemide therapy may be associated with clinically significant thiamine deficiency due to urinary loss and contribute to impaired cardiac performance in patients with CHF. This deficit may be prevented or corrected by appropriate thiamine supplements.\r"

However, these trials have reported too few strokes for powerful risk factor analysis. Observational studies may provide additional information. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors in a larger number of patients with stroke and nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, using case-control methodology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all patients discharged from one hospital over an 8-year period who met our case definition of nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke (n = 134), and compared them with contemporaneous control subjects who were discharged with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation without stroke (n = 131). RESULTS: Cases and controls were similar in terms of duration of atrial fibrillation; proportion with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; percentage with a past medical history of angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, or smoking; and mean left atrial size. In contrast, cases were significantly older than controls (78.5 versus 74.8 years, p = 0.002) and more likely to have a history of hypertension (55% versus 38%, p = 0.0093). The relative odds for stroke was 1.91 for patients with hypertension, 1.73 for patients older than 75 years, and 3.26 for patients with both factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that age and hypertension should be considered when deciding upon long-term anticoagulant therapy to prevent stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are inflammatory muscular diseases of unknown cause. Many interventions are available to treat patients with these conditions including corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, plasmapheresis, and total body irradiation. However, these therapies are not always effective, and they may be associated with certain serious side effects. An attempt was made to evaluate the efficacy of polyvalent intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis refractory to traditional treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients (16 women and 4 men; mean age 43 [16 SD] years), 14 with chronic refractory polymyositis and six with dermatomyositis, received high doses of IVIG because of the failure of traditional treatments (prednisone [19], methotrexate [10], azathioprine [6], cyclophosphamide [3], cyclosporine [3], chlorambucil [1], plasmapheresis [8], lymphopheresis [1], and total body irradiation [1]). In one patient with positive results on picornavirus serologic testing, IVIG was the first treatment choice. IVIG therapy was given with prednisone in 15 patients, with methotrexate in six patients, and with plasmapheresis in one patient. There were no changes in treatment in the 2 months before the introduction of IVIG therapy and no increases in dose during this treatment. Preparations of polyvalent human intravenous gammaglobulins with increased intact immunoglobulin G were used. Thirteen patients received 1 g/kg daily for 2 days each month, and seven patients received 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days each month. The mean duration of treatment was 4 months. RESULTS: Clinical assessment, which consisted of the measurement of proximal muscle power, and biochemical studies were carried out before each treatment period. Significant clinical improvement was noted in 15 of the 20 patients. Mean muscle power estimated for the 20 patients before and after IVIG therapy was statistically significantly reduced (p less than 0.01). Eighteen patients showed biochemical improvement, and two patients with normal initial serum creatine kinase levels showed clinical improvement. Mean creatine kinase levels for the 20 patients during IVIG therapy showed a statistically significant decrease from the first IVIG perfusions (p less than 0.01). Side effects of IVIG therapy were noted in four patients; however, these effects were mild. During IVIG therapy, steroid doses were significantly reduced from the second or the third IVIG infusion (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: IVIG is an efficacious new therapy for polymyositis and dermatomyositis and should play a role in the treatment of these diseases, replacing or reducing steroid and immunosuppressive medications.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The mainstay of pharmacologic therapy in patients with dermatomyositis is corticosteroids. However, because patients sometimes become refractory to these drugs and because these drugs have potential short- and long-term toxicities, alternate therapy is highly desirable. Therefore, a pilot study was initiated using high-dose intravenous gammaglobulin (IVGG) in the treatment of dermatomyositis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IVGG was administered to five patients with juvenile dermatomyositis. Prior to IVGG treatment, all patients had persistent muscle weakness despite daily corticosteroids and three patients had developed unacceptable steroid toxicity. Two of the patients had previously developed toxicity while receiving immunosuppressive therapy. RESULTS: IVGG therapy resulted in improved muscle strength and ameliorated skin rash in all patients. The percentage increase in muscle strength as measured by sphygmomanometry following the 9-month course of IVGG ranged from 56% to 606% in the proximal lower extremities and from 30% to 186% in the proximal upper extremities. Following IVGG therapy, prednisone could be discontinued or the dose reduced in all patients. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that IVGG may allow steroid sparing in dermatomyositis and may provide a safe alternative to cytotoxic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the postural blood pressure response over time, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with syncope, and the relationship of orthostatic hypotension to recurrence of symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 223 patients with syncope in a standardized manner. Orthostatic responses were measured in a standardized fashion at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes or until symptoms occurred. Follow-up was obtained at 3-month intervals. Causes of syncope were assigned by predetermined criteria. RESULTS: Orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure decline) was found in 69 patients (31%). The median time to reach minimal standing systolic blood pressure was 1 minute for all subjects. In patients with orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater), mean time to reach minimum blood pressure was 2.4 minutes. The vast majority of patients with significant orthostatic hypotension had this finding within 2 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension was common in patients for whom other probable causes of syncope were assigned. The recurrence of syncope was not related to the degree of orthostatic hypotension; however, the recurrence of dizziness and syncope as end-points was lower in patients with 20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure reductions as compared with patients with lesser degrees of orthostatic blood pressure declines. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic hypotension is common in patients with syncope and is detected in the vast majority of patients by 2 minutes. Although symptom recurrence on follow-up was lower in patients with more severe orthostatic hypotension, the clinical significance of this finding needs to be further defined by future studies.\r"

  ".U": "91328208\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: Eosinophiluria has been reported in acute interstitial nephritis and other renal diseases, but its presence in atheroembolic renal disease (AERD) has not been previously established. AERD has been identified as a cause of acute and chronic renal failure, particularly in elderly patients with advanced atherosclerosis and in those patients who have undergone manipulation or intervention of the abdominal aorta, renal artery, or coronary artery. The definitive diagnosis is made by renal biopsy. However, many patients are too acutely ill to tolerate renal biopsy and, in recent years, peripheral eosinophilia, hypocomplementemia, and thrombocytopenia have been recognized in association with AERD. Previous studies have reported that AERD is associated with an inactive renal sediment and an absence of urine eosinophils. We reviewed our experience over a 4-year period with 24 patients with renal biopsy-proven AERD. RESULTS: Urine eosinophils were evaluated in nine patients to help determine the cause of their renal deterioration. Seven of these patients presented with evidence of vascular disease. Three patients had procedures involving manipulation of the abdominal aorta. Physical examination revealed findings of atheroembolism in three of nine patients. Overall, eight of nine patients had a positive Hansel's stain for eosinophiluria. Six of eight patients had more than 5% of their urinary white cell count as eosinophils. The reason for failure of previous studies to detect eosinophiluria in AERD is unclear but may have been related to the use of Wright's stain instead of Hansel's stain. CONCLUSION: In the evaluation of acute renal insufficiency, eosinophiluria may indicate AERD in addition to the other known causes for this finding.\r"

METHODS: A retrospective systematic critique of five epidemiologic studies published in the English literature during 1978 to 1989 identified on Medline and manual literature searches. The evidence was evaluated using the standard observational criteria for causation: strength of association, consistency, dose-response relationship, temporal sequence, specificity, and biologic plausibility. RESULTS: We found evidence to support a causal association between sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension in consistency and specificity and some evidence to suggest a dose-response relationship. Review of the data dealing with the mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea and hypertension allowed us to advance several theories to provide support for biologic plausibility. CONCLUSION: We concluded that there is a positive association--relative risk estimate between 1.3 and 40--for sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension, but the risk association is unstable. Thus, we believe that there is insufficient data to justify doing polysomnography as part of the routine diagnostic work-up for patients with hypertension.\r"

In all but one case, the retinitis began in the posterior pole with little or no clinical evidence of vasculitis. All five patients had relentless progression of disease and were left with atrophic and necrotic retinae, pale optic-nerve heads, and narrowed vasculature. None of the patients developed aqueous or vitreal inflammation or retinal detachment. Clinical and laboratory evidence suggested that varicella-zoster virus was the causal agent in all five cases. First, the onset of retinitis in four cases either succeeded or was coincident with an eruption of dermatomal zoster. Second, varicella-zoster virus was cultured from the two chorioretinal specimens and varicella-zoster virus antigen was detected in the vitreal aspirate from one case. Third, by means of immunocytochemistry, varicella-zoster virus antigen was found in the outer retinae of both enucleation specimens. Fourth, viral capsids with the size and shape of herpesviridae were found in the outer retinae of both enucleation specimens. The clinical features observed in this study are distinct from those described for the acute retinal necrosis syndrome and appear to constitute a new and highly characteristic pattern of varicella-zoster virus-induced disease.\r"

Only four of the 98 patients with panuveitis (4.1%) were considered idiopathic after a comprehensive examination, whereas 94 of the 183 patients with anterior uveitis (51.4%) were similarly classified. We found an associated condition in 242 of the 400 patients of the study group (60.5%). Of these 242 patients, 61 had Behcet's disease, which constituted the most frequently encountered associated condition in this study. Of the 61 patients with Behcet's disease, 58 had panuveitis and constituted 59.2% of the panuveitis group. Of the 61 patients with intermediate uveitis, 17 (27.9%) had a concurrent disease. An associated condition was found in 95% and 96.2% of patients with unilateral and bilateral panuveitis, respectively, but in none of the patients with unilateral intermediate uveitis. Environmental, cultural, or genetic factors may be accountable for the differences discovered between our findings and those of previously published studies from the United States and England with respect to relative frequencies of some of the associated diseases in patients with chronic uveitis.\r"

The incidence of optic disk drusen in cases of pseudoxanthoma elasticum is 20 to 50 times greater than that in the healthy population. We postulate that the abnormal aggregation of macromolecules with a high affinity for calcium (resulting in abnormalities in elastin in cases of pseudoxanthoma elasticum) also develops at the cribriform plate, disrupting axonal flow and leading to disk drusen formation. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is associated with marked cardiovascular and gastrointestinal morbidity. Moreover, macular hemorrhage and precipitation of angioid streaks have frequently been noted after trauma. Prompt diagnosis of pseudoxanthoma elasticum will allow necessary prophylaxis and must be considered in patients with optic disk drusen.\r"

Six hundred twenty-five measurements of surface contour were made on each eye by use of simultaneous stereoscopic videography. Regional differences in short-term measurement variability were studied in 12 eyes (six normal and six glaucomatous), each imaged nine times over several days. The widths of the 95% confidence interval for the measurements averaged 82 microns for the juxta-papillary surface and 132 microns for the disk surface. Measurements of peripapillary surface contour were significantly less variable than were measurements of the disk surface (P = .000). The greatest variability was detected along large blood vessels and at steep contours. Long-term variability was studied in a separate group of 30 clinically stable patients with glaucoma, each imaged three to six times over a period of more than one year. The widths of the 95% confidence intervals were 132 microns for the peripapillary surface and 217 microns for the disk surface. The long-term variability was significantly greater than the short-term variability (P = .000). The peripapillary nerve fiber layer surface, located away from the margins of large vessels, may provide the most dependable measurements of contour. These estimates of long-term variability of optic disk and peripapillary contour measurements provide clinically relevant confidence intervals with which to detect progressive glaucomatous nerve fiber damage.\r"

Thirteen eyes required secondary or tertiary optic nerve sheath decompression after an initial successful result. Eleven of 13 eyes had improved visual function after repeat optic nerve sheath decompression. We believe that patients with acute papilledema and visual loss should be offered optic nerve sheath decompression, and if symptoms recur, repeat optic nerve sheath decompression is a safe and effective treatment option.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a masked randomized study of 50 patients to evaluate the effect of administration of topical indomethacin 1% suspension on symptoms in corneal scars, edema, infiltrates, and erosions. Patients with symptoms (photophobia, pain, itching, burning sensation, foreign-body sensation, and tearing) were treated with topically administered indomethacin 1% or placebo and monitored for eight weeks. The severity of the complaints was rated and the scores were evaluated (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Of the 25 patients treated with indomethacin, 21 (84%) had improvement in symptoms and the severity of each of the symptoms was significantly decreased. Of the 25 patients treated with placebo, one (4%) had improvement in symptoms without statistical change of the severity of the symptoms. However, when the placebo-treated patients received indomethacin drops, the symptoms were significantly decreased (P less than .002). This study suggests that topical administration of indomethacin 1% may reduce ocular symptoms in patients with corneal scars, edema, or erosions.\r"

Therefore, the impaired visual acuity cannot be adequately corrected by spectacles in most cases. In this study, high oxygen-transmissible aspheric rigid lenses were fitted, with computer assistance, in 26 scarred eyes of 23 consecutive patients. In 15 of 26 eyes (57.7%), a successful fitting with good vision, no complications, and a sufficiently long wearing time was accomplished. The main lens-related complications included fluorescein-staining epithelial defects in five of 26 eyes (19.2%) and epithelial edema in two of 26 eyes (7.7%). Computer-aided fitting was of limited value because keratometer readings were not measurable in 50% of the cases. The results of this study indicate that the application of high oxygen-transmissible aspheric rigid contact lenses may obviate corneal surgery.\r"

Constriction to pilocarpine was greater in darkness and in dim light than in bright light, indicating that the pupillary-light reflex masked the constrictive effect of pilocarpine. In ten other subjects pupillary constriction to 50 microliters of pilocarpine 0.04%, and to 50 and 100 microliters of pilocarpine 0.0625%, was measured on separate occasions.

Patients with low nm23 staining tumors, determined by three pathologists independently, had reduced survival times (alpha = 0.034, alpha = 0.012, alpha = 0.052 by the log rank test). Nm23 expression approached significance as an independent predictor of survival in Cox's proportional hazards model.

DNA strand breaks were first observed 3 to 4 hours after contact with TNF alpha and preceded cell death. Limiting doses of TNF alpha caused DNA strand breaks only in a subpopulation of L929 cells. At a low dose, TNF alpha led to DNA damage without any subsequent loss of cell viability.

This study reports that MRL-lpr mice have an increased level of circulating macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) detectable as early as 1 week of age. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor decreased between 2 and 4 months and then steadily increased beginning at 4 months of age. In contrast, M-CSF was not detected in sera from congenic MRL-++ mice, normal C3H/FeJ mice, two other mouse strains with the lpr gene (B6-lpr and C3H-lpr), or another lupus model, the NZB/W mouse. These observations indicate that the lpr gene alone is not responsible for inducing this growth factor, and elevated M-CSF is not required for all forms of murine lupus. The entire source of serum M-CSF is not clear. The unique T cells regulated by the lpr gene are not responsible for the increased serum M-CSF levels, as no M-CSFs could be detected in supernatants from cultured lymph nodes from MRL-lpr mice, and the steady-state levels of M-CSF mRNA in lymph nodes and spleens in MRL-lpr, C3H-lpr mice and in their respective congenic strains were similar. The steady-state M-CSF mRNA transcripts in liver, lung, and bone marrow in MRL-lpr, MRL-++, and C3H/FeJ mice were also similar. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor transcripts were clearly elevated in the kidneys of MRL-lpr mice, suggesting a renal source of circulating M-CSF. The increase of M-CSF might be responsible for the increased numbers and enhanced functions of macrophages, which in turn cause tissue destruction in MRL-lpr mice.\r"

Inflammation of joints and tendons began on days 4 through 7 and heart on days 7 through 10, which coincided with colonization of tissues with spirochetes. Spirochetes were multifocal in distribution, with a predilection for collagenous connective tissue of joints, heart, arteries, nerves, muscle, skin, and other tissues. Relative numbers of spirochetes peaked at 15 days, then decreased by 21 days.

  ".W": "The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was discovered in a search for cell surface antigens of chicken neurons that contribute to cell adhesion and pattern formation during development. Homologous adhesion molecules have been identified in several species, including humans. In this immunohistochemical study, the authors examine the role of human NCAM in tumor diagnosis. The authors used a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 5.1H11, to examine NCAM immunoreactivity in frozen sections of more than 450 tumors, including more than 80 small round cell tumors (SRCT) of childhood and adolescence (neuroblastomas, Ewing's sarcomas [ES], peripheral neuroepitheliomas [PN], primitive neuroectodermal tumors [PNET], esthesioneuroblastomas, malignant ectomesenchymoma, medulloblastomas, small cell osteosarcomas, mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and lymphomas). The authors show that 1) neuroblastomas and primary brain tumors are NCAM+; 2) ES, most PN/PNETs, and melanomas are NCAM-; 3) embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and various other sarcomas are NCAM+; 4) neuroendocrine tumors are NCAM+; 5) subsets of carcinomas of kidney, ovary, lung and other organs are NCAM+; and 6) lymphoid tumors are NCAM-. Tests with normal fetal and adult tissues indicate that these findings reflect only in part the NCAM phenotypes of corresponding normal tissues. Notably the NCAM- phenotype of ES and PN/PNET is not explained by current histogenetic models for these tumors, which suggest a primitive neuroectodermal origin. Finally the authors show that NCAM expression among SRCT has an inverse relationship with the expression of p30/32MIC2, a cell surface antigen of ES and PN/PNET detected with MAb HBA71. These results suggest that immunohistochemical assays for NCAM and p30/32MIC2 expression may aid in the further characterization of SRCT of childhood and adolescence.\r"

A typical feature of NCAM is polysialic acid, of which the chain length is developmentally regulated. The authors have performed a comparative immunohistochemical study on small cell lung carcinomas and bronchial as well as gastrointestinal carcinoids with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 735 reactive with the long-chain form of polysialic acid. The small cell lung carcinomas, irrespective of their histological type, were positive for polysialic acid. Metastatic tumor cell complexes also exhibited immunostaining. The tumor cell-surface-associated immunostaining for polysialic acid was sensitive to endoneuraminidase. The mature and atypical bronchial and gastrointestinal carcinoids were not immunoreactive for polysialic acid. Cytoplasmic staining in groups of cells of carcinoids (2 of 28 cases) was due to nonspecific antibody binding, which could be prevented by increased ion strength. These data indicate that neuroendocrine tumors of the lung can be distinguished by their content of highly sialylated NCAM.\r"

Because expression of mdr-1 is increased in neuroblastoma cell lines by differentiating agents, the authors hypothesized a similar correlation with differentiation in vivo in neuroblastomas. In 12 tumors from 11 patients, total RNA analysis demonstrated no correlation with differentiation, but a correlation could be detected in the cell-based methods of analysis. The very primitive 'stroma'-poor, poorly differentiated neuroblastomas had low levels of mdr-1/P-glycoprotein. The intermediate grades had higher levels of expression and although heterogeneity of differentiation appeared within these tumors, both primitive and more differentiated cells expressed the gene at comparable levels within the tumor. One very well-differentiated neuroblastoma, a ganglioneuroma, had no detectable expression in the neurofibrillary material, but demonstrated expression in adjacent large ganglionic cells. Thus mdr-1/P-glycoprotein expression increased with increasing differentiation among tumors, and was present in ganglionic cells in the most well-differentiated tumor. The three tumors with the highest levels of expression were obtained from patients who received preoperative chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibody (MAb) HBA71, which was raised against Ewing's sarcoma cells, recognizes a cell-surface glycoprotein, p30/32MIC2, that is encoded by the MIC2 gene in the pseudoautosomal region of human chromosomes X and Y. This immunohistochemical study evaluates the specificity and sensitivity of MAb HBA71 for tumor diagnosis. Frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues of more than 300 tumors of diverse histologic type, including more than 100 small round cell tumors of childhood and adolescence, were tested with this MAb by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedure. The authors found HBA71 immunoreactivity in 61 of 63 Ewing's sarcomas studied and 9 of 11 primitive neuroectodermal tumors and peripheral neuroepitheliomas. HBA71-negative tumors included neuroblastomas (0 of 24), melanomas (0 of 13), an esthesioneuroblastoma, small cell osteosarcomas (0 of 2), a malignant ectomesenchymoma, desmoplastic SRCT (0 of 5), and medulloblastomas (0 of 5). Heterogeneous expression of HBA71 immunostaining was found in some embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (3 of 14) and astrocytomas (4 of 7), and in a few neuroendocrine tumors (4 of 26), carcinomas (3 of 94), and lymphomas (6 of 30). Because Ewing's sarcomas are consistently HBA71 positive, the authors searched for antigen-positive normal cells that may represent precursors for these tumors; however, no obvious candidate for the elusive cell of origin for Ewing's sarcoma was identified in the normal fetal tissues tested. Their findings indicate that HBA71 is a highly restricted cell-surface antigen of Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and immunohistochemistry employing this antibody may be of value in the differential diagnosis of selected small round cell tumors in childhood and adolescence.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a polypeptide that regulates cellular growth and modulates the synthesis of various cell surface and secreted molecules, has been identified in the pregnant uterus. To determine which specific cells transcribed and translated this gene, extraembryonic fetal tissues (placenta and membranes) and uterine tissue from early and late stages of gestation were analyzed for TNF-alpha mRNA by in situ hybridization using biotinylated antisense and sense TNF-alpha probes, and for immunoreactive TNF-alpha using two monoclonal antibodies. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha transcripts and protein were identified in both extraembryonic and maternal cells. In first-trimester placental villi, TNF-alpha mRNA was present in syncytiotrophoblast but was low to absent in cytotrophoblast and villous stromal cells. Decidual and epithelial cells in maternal tissues contained TNF-alpha transcripts. In term placentas, both syncytiotrophoblast and villous stromal cells contained TNF-alpha mRNA, and transcripts were present in maternal cells in the decidua adjacent to the extraplacental membranes. In both first-trimester and term tissues, coincident expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and immunoreactive TNF-alpha was demonstrated. The results of this study show that TNF-alpha is synthesized by cells in both extraembryonic membranes and maternal tissues during human gestation and that transcription in specific types of cells is influenced by gestational age. These observations are consistent with a major role for TNF-alpha in the dynamic developmental events of human pregnancy.\r"

Cardiac tissue from patients with DCM and, for control purposes, cardiac tissue from patients with other forms of cardiomyopathy and from patients with no history of cardiac disease were stained with heterologous and ANT-, BCKD-, and myosin-specific affinity-purified sera from DCM patients. Data demonstrate that although anti-myosin stains tissues from both patients and normal controls, the ANT- and BCKD-specific heterologous and affinity-purified sera from DCM patients stain only cardiac tissues from DCM patients. Intense staining in patchy areas of cardiac tissue suggests that abnormal increased expression of these putative autoantigens occurs in discrete areas of cardiac myocytes. The reactivity of the antisera was organ specific and only seen in tissues from DCM patients. The organ and disease specificity of these findings suggests that such expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human DCM.\r"

  ".W": "Tissues from adult Syrian hamsters were studied with immunoperoxidase techniques using polyclonal antibodies to glutathione-S-transferase (rat liver and human placental enzymes) and human erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase. Most tissues immunostained similarly with these antibodies. Most notable was the cytoplasmic staining of mesenchyme tissues, especially smooth muscle, by all three antibodies. Epithelial cells stained distinctively, but usually less intensely than mesenchyme. Epithelial cells from all levels of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory epithelium, transitional epithelium, and epidermis all showed strong staining with these antibodies. Other epithelial cell types were usually positive but showed less dramatic staining. Most epithelial tissues showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining; some also showed cell-surface (eg, cilia) staining. The role of these enzymes in cell differentiation of a stable organ was studied by immunostaining the kidney during its development. Early stroma (13- and 15-day fetuses) of the kidney (metanephric mesenchyme) showed strong cell-surface staining for glutathione transferases and moderate staining for glutathione peroxidase; renal tubules (which are epithelial cells) at this stage were negative for these markers. As renal tubules differentiated, first cytoplasm and then nuclei stained moderately, suggesting that glutathione-S-transferases and glutathione peroxidase are markers of both mesenchymal cells, including embryonic mesenchyme, and terminal differentiation of at least some epithelial cells.\r"

To evaluate further the nature of ET-induced mesangial cell activation, the authors evaluated the effects of this agent on MC morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Bacterial ET, in concentrations as low as I ng/ml, induced reversible membrane ruffling, cellular rounding, and extension of many filopodia and lamellopodia. Augmented fluid-phase pinocytosis occurred in parallel, as determined by transmission electron microscopy and tritiated sucrose uptake. These cellular morphologic and functional changes were associated with an extensive, but reversible, depolymerization of actin microfilaments. Actin gene expression was also modified by ET. At 4 to 6 hours after ET exposure, Northern blot analysis showed a twofold to fourfold increase in actin mRNA levels. In situ hybridizations of ET-stimulated cells at the light and electron microscopic levels demonstrated a markedly asymmetric distribution of actin mRNA, which was localized in the cellular periphery at filopodial and lamellopodial extensions, presumably sites of new actin protein synthesis. It is concluded that ET effects on MC are distinct from the nonspecific lytic or 'toxic' actions described for other cell types. Endotoxin induces a global activation of this cell type associated with major changes in membrane structure, cytoskeletal organization, and gene expression, which resemble in many respects the responses to peptide mitogens.\r"

  ".W": "Lysosomes have long been implicated as a factor contributing to the progression and complication of atherosclerosis. The authors' laboratory previously has shown that lysosomal ultrastructure in arterial macrophage foam cells is altered as primary lysosomes give rise to large pleiomorphic organelles on lipid accumulation during lesion progression. To further explore the subcellular alterations in lysosomes and associated organelles during foam cell formation, three-dimensional (3D) intermediate voltage electron microscopy was used to examine monocyte-derived macrophages (monocyte/macrophages) during early in vitro uptake of beta migrating very-low-density lipoproteins (beta VLDL). Lysosomes were identified using acid phosphatase cytochemistry, and in control cells these organelles constituted 3.5% of the total cytoplasmic volume. Both primary and secondary lysosomes were observed. Upon beta VLDL uptake, the total volume of acid-phosphatase-positive organelles increased threefold over 30 minutes, and the reaction product was found in three additional morphologically distinct structures: tubular lysosomes, membrane stacks, and endoplasmic reticulum with widened cisternae. The proportion of the cell occupied by each of the five acid-phosphatase-positive organelles was quantitated at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 4 hours of beta VLDL incubation, and their relative abundance was compared with controls that were processed either with no lipoprotein challenge or albumin incubation for 1 hour. Secondary lysosomes compartment volume peaked at 30 minutes; over the ensuing 3.5 hours, however, the reaction progressively shifted to three new membrane-limited locations. Our observations document the complex 3D organization and spacial relationships among the acid-phosphatase-positive structures induced by lipoprotein uptake. The 3D organization patterns for acid-phosphatase-positive lysosomes in lipoprotein-stimulated pigeon monocyte/macrophages were similar in several aspects to the complex lysosomes previously observed in the macrophages of pigeon arterial lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) in killing of schistosomula is controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine the schistosomulacidal activity of human monocytes isolated by two different techniques. Peripheral blood monocytes were obtained either by venipuncture (PBMv) or plasmapheresis (PBMp), purified on Ficoll-Paque, and cultured briefly. The cells then were incubated with schistosomula (cell parasite ratio of 10(4):1) for 16 to 18 hours with or without interferon-gamma IFN-gamma (600 U/ml) or sera from patients with schistosomiasis as a source of antischistosomal antibodies (HASA). Freshly isolated PBMv treated with IFN-gamma or HASA did not kill schistosomula. Freshly isolated PBMp alone killed 22 +/- 13% (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]; n = 9) of worms over background and after incubation with IFN-gamma and HASA, 30 +/- 17%. PBMp cultured in vitro for 7 days killed 50 +/- 15% (mean +/- SD; n = 12) of the schistosomula. Pretreatment of the cells with IFN-gamma and incubation with HASA did not significantly enhance the parasite killing beyond this level. Electron microscopy showed that freshly isolated PBMp attached to the worms and fused occasionally with the outer tegumental membrane. Granules constituted 1.4% of the cytoplasmic volume. Degranulation onto the parasite surface was not observed. Peripheral blood monocytes obtained by plasmapheresis accumulated glycogen during in vitro culture with the parasite and released threefold more H2O2 than PBMv after exposure to phorbol myristate acetate. Thus plasmapheresis increases the schistosomulacidal activity of PBM, enhances the generation of H2O2 and promotes the accumulation of glycogen.\r"

  ".W": "Female Swiss mice (Cr:NIH(S)) developed bronchiolar cell hyperplasia, dysplasia, metaplasia, and various morphologic types of bronchiolar cell tumors after topical (skin) application of N-nitroso-methyl-bis-chloroethylurea (NMBCU) or N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea (NTCU). These compounds are the first found to induce systemically bronchiolar cell tumors in mice in high incidence. Twice a week, with a 3-day interval, a 25-microliter drop of 0.04 mol/l (molar) NMBCU or NTCU in acetone was applied to the shaved interscapular integument for a maximum of 35 to 40 weeks. The earliest lung neoplasms were seen in mice that died after 23 weeks of treatment and affected 11 of 19 with NMBCU and 14 of 19 with NTCU treatment. Tumor growth pattern was nodular or the neoplastic tissue was frequently disseminated throughout the parenchyma, starting from multicentric peribronchiolar foci. The most common tumor types were squamous cell carcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas, followed by adenocarcinomas with or without secretory cells, and a single ciliated-cell tumor. Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies were carried out on paraffin-embedded lungs using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex procedure and antisera against keratin, Clara cell antigen, surfactant apoprotein, neuron-specific enolase, bombesin, and chromogranin A. In several mice from both groups, hyperplasias and tumors were composed of cells expressing Clara cell antigen. No tumor cells were found expressing alveolar type II or neuroendocrine cell markers. It appeared that bronchiolar cells, in particular Clara cells, had migrated from terminal bronchioles or invaded bronchiolar walls to extend into the alveolar parenchyma. Squamous cell metaplasia with keratin expression was seen within airways or associated with glandular tumors, especially at the periphery. A unique cell type, with large eosinophilic globules and associated eosinophilic crystals, was seen lining airways or forming hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions. N-nitroso-methyl-bis-chloroethylurea- and NTCU-induced mouse bronchiolar cell alterations could be an interesting new model to study mechanisms of bronchiolar cell differentiation and tumor formation.\r"

The fraction of cells with random migration rates greater than 10 microns/hour was 8% in an established primary melanoma cell line, 2% and 34% in two recurrent cutaneous melanoma cell lines, and 5%, 30%, 31%, and 60% in four metastatic cell lines. The three metastatic cell lines with significantly higher mean migration rates (P less than 0.001) were derived from lymph node metastases, whereas the fourth metastatic cell line was derived from a visceral metastasis. The cellular morphology and presence of cell nests in the original tissue correlated with in vitro cell morphology and the formation of colonies. The ability of cells to organize actin into stress fibers directly correlated with significantly higher random migration rates and lack of colony formation. Characterization of random migration rates and actin organization of human melanoma cells that are isolated from different stages of tumor progression may lend insight into metastasis.\r"

Messenger RNA levels for ECM genes except for laminin A chain increased significantly with the progression of nephritis in NZB/W F1 mice. In the NZW kidneys, however, the mRNA levels for alpha 1(IV) chain, laminin B1 and B2 chains, and HSPG declined markedly with age, whereas those for alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III) chains showed little difference throughout the experimental period. Messenger RNA levels of beta-actin remained constant, and those of laminin A chain could not be detected in either control or diseased kidneys. Immunofluorescent microscopy showed that the intensity and distribution of staining of collagen IV, laminin, and HSPG in the glomeruli of NZB/W F1 mice increased markedly with the progression of disease. Types I and III collagen were not detected in the glomeruli of NZB/W F1 mice by immunofluorescence until 24 weeks of age, after which increased amounts of these collagens were found in the glomeruli and interstitium with progression of disease. These results suggest that increased levels of mRNA coding for ECM components and increased accumulation of these proteins may contribute to a cascade of events, leading to chronic renal injury in lupus nephritis.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of basement membrane type VII collagen was detected immunohistochemically and compared in normal human organs and their neoplastic derivatives using monoclonal antibody LH7.2. In normal tissues, type VII collagen was found to be restricted to the basement membrane surrounding or underlying combined epithelia, such as those lining breast, prostate, and bronchus, which are composed of a basal and luminal cell layer, and stratified epithelia, such as larynx, esophagus, trachea, vagina, ectocervix, and epidermis. No type VII collagen was found in the \"simple' epithelia lining the major part of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract, such as liver, stomach, and intestine, or around blood vessels, muscle, and nerve fibers, which are surrounded, however, by a basement membrane containing type IV collagen and laminin. When tested in benign and malignant local tumors, antibody LH7.2 showed staining patterns partly similar to those observed in the corresponding normal tissues. This resulted in a well-circumscribed positive reaction around ducts in carcinomas in situ of the breast, in benign prostate tumors, in pleomorphic adenomas, and in a negative reaction in tumors of the GI tract. Furthermore type VII collagen was predominantly seen in carcinomas with a squamous differentiation, such as squamous carcinomas of the lung, head and neck, vulva, and vagina. These results indicate that the presence of type VII collagen in malignant tumors is correlated with (squamous) differentiation rather than with the origin of the tumor. With tumor progression, an increased presence of type VII collagen, as compared with normal urinary bladder, was found in infiltrating transitional cell carcinomas. Thus, although in general invasive and metastatic tumors do not express extensively type VII collagen, exceptions to this rule exist in bladder cancer, squamous carcinomas of the lung, tumors of the head and neck region, female genital tract tumors, and in some adenocarcinomas of the breast.\r"

In animals with septic shock induced with live Escherichia coli, there was widespread expression of ELAM-1, recognized by monoclonal antibodies H4/18 or ENA-1 in most tissues examined with strong staining in the lung, liver, and kidneys. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 expression was evident in capillaries, venules, small veins, arterioles, and arteries. In contrast, baboons with traumatic/hypovolemic shock had minimal levels of focal ELAM expression in all organs studied. Similarly evidence of neutrophil activation, measured by granulocyte elastase levels in the plasma was much more pronounced in animals with septic shock. The study documents that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cytokine-induced endothelial activation occurs in vivo in septic shock. Much higher levels of ELAM-1 expression and plasma granulocyte-elastase titer in septic shock, as contrasted with traumatic/hypovolemic shock, are consistent with the higher levels of circulating tumor necrosis factor, other cytokines, and LPS in sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "The human knee joint represents a complex biomechanical system of which the menisci are an integral component. At present, little data exists describing the meniscal kinematics of the intact knee. Accordingly, a three-dimensional reconstruction magnetic resonance image model was used to explore this issue. Five fresh cadaveric knees were examined by magnetic resonance imaging throughout a full range of motion at 10 degrees intervals. Computer three-dimensional images of the menisci were generated and evaluated for anteroposterior excursion and deformation. During flexion, the posterior excursion of the medial meniscus was 5.1 mm, while that of the lateral meniscus was 11.2 mm. The anterior horn segments were shown to be more mobile than the posterior horn segments bilaterally. Prior limitations of meniscal kinematic assessment may be overcome with advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction. The menisci are highly mobile and easily deformed structures within the intact, cadaveric knee. This imaging technique may prove useful in the elucidation of meniscal dynamics. In the future, similar techniques may be applied clinically to aid in the diagnosis of joint dysfunction.\r"

Specimens were equally divided into three groups of nine pairs each based on age: younger (22 to 35 years), middle (40 to 50 years), and older (60 to 97 years). Anterior-posterior displacement tests with the intact knee at 30 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion revealed a significant effect of knee flexion angle, but not of specimen age. Tensile tests of the femur-ACL-tibia complex were performed at 30 degrees of knee flexion with the ACL aligned vertically along the direction of applied tensile load. One knee from each pair was oriented anatomically (anatomical orientation), and the contralateral knee was oriented with the tibia aligned vertically (tibial orientation). Structural properties of the femur-ACL-tibia complex, as represented by the linear stiffness, ultimate load, and energy absorbed, were found to decrease significantly with specimen age and were also found to have higher values in specimens tested in the anatomical orientation. In the younger specimens, linear stiffness (242 +/- 28 N/mm) and ultimate load (2160 +/- 157 N) values found when the femur-ACL-tibia complex was tested in the anatomical orientation were higher than those reported previously in the literature. These values provide new baseline data for the design and selection of grafts for ACL replacement in an attempt to reproduce normal knee kinematics.\r"

  ".W": "A review is presented here of 36 cases, seen since 1980, of acute Grade III (unstable) sports-related sprains of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint. In all cases, the injury involved the ulnar collateral ligament. A Stener lesion was present in 97% of cases. Followup was from 2.0 to 8.5 years, the average being 3.9 years. All of the patients underwent repeat examination and radiography at followup. The first seven patients were treated by \"traditional\" pull-out suture and K-wire fixation, put into a cast for 4 weeks, and then gradually mobilized over 4 additional weeks. Thereafter, a \"new method\" was used. Avulsed ulnar collateral ligament stumps were sutured to the tendinous insertion of the adductor pollicis or to a soft tissue remnant using strong suture material. Large bony avulsions were pinned; small fragments were excised and the ligament was repaired. This latter method of repair was quite strong and allowed rapid mobilization: only 2 weeks in a cast, then a hand-mounted thumb spica orthosis was used while therapy progressed. Of the patients treated with the new method, 84% had excellent results and, overall, were able to return to sports sooner than patients treated with the traditional method. Pain, stability, and strength were corrected equally between groups; however, strength was restored more rapidly in the new method group. Range of motion was reduced equally in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91328319\r", 
  ".W": "There has been increasing interest within the European sports medicine community regarding the etiology and treatment of groin pain in the athlete. Groin pain is most commonly caused by musculotendinous strains of the adductors and other muscles crossing the hip joint, but may also be related to abdominal wall abnormalities. Cases may be termed \"pubalgia\" if physical examination does not reveal inguinal hernia and there is an absence of other etiology for groin pain. We present nine cases of patients who underwent herniorrhaphies for groin pain. Two patients had groin pain without evidence of a hernia preoperatively (pubalgia). In the remaining seven patients we determined the presence of a hernia by physical examination. At operation, eight patients were found to have inguinal hernias. One patient had no hernia but had partial avulsion of the internal oblique fibers from their insertion at the public tubercle. The average interval from operation to return to full activity was 11 weeks. All patients returned to full activity within 3 months of surgery. One patient had persistent symptoms of mild incisional tenderness, but otherwise there were no recurrences, complications, or persistence of symptoms. Abnormalities of the abdominal wall, including inguinal hernias and microscopic tears or avulsions of the internal oblique muscle, can be an overlooked source of groin pain in the athlete. Operative treatment of this condition with herniorrhaphy can return the athlete to his sport within 3 months.\r"

The average followup was 61.3 months (range, 48 to 86). The average time from injury to surgery was 7 days (range, 1 to 18). Eighty percent of the injuries were sports-related with football and skiing predominating. Thirty-eight percent were \"isolated\" ACL tears, and 62% had associated injuries. There was a 46% incidence of meniscal tear with 59% of the meniscal tears being repaired. The postoperative evaluation included a multifactorial analysis correlating 43 variables including subjective, objective, radiographic, and KT-1000 data. The Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Diagnostic Score, a clinical objective score based on the postoperative Lachman and pivot shift examination, a KT-1000 arthrometer data score, and an overall combined assessment score were determined. The results showed 59% excellent, 18% good, 14% fair, and 8% poor. The Lachman test was diagnostic in all cases. The quality of ACL tissue at repair was rated excellent or good in 62% of the cases. Four patterns of ACL tears were distinguished by the location of the tear. Football injury, younger age, increased peroperative pivot shift, midsubstance Type IV tear, and return of full motion correlated with poor postoperative results. Increasing age, tight jointedness, Type I tears, and a 5 degrees flexion contracture correlated with good postoperative results.\r"

Within the first 12 weeks these allografts were revascularized; in the first 26 weeks they had matured to resemble normal connective tissue. Graft stiffness was 29% of the control value and maximum force to failure was 43% of the control value. The results of this study indicated that freeze-dried bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts are biomechanically and biologically similar to patellar tendon autografts.\r"

Thus, the purpose of this study was to decide how the muscles responsible for humeral motion can best be exercised in a rehabilitation program for the throwing athlete. Dynamic, fine wire, intramuscular electromyography was carried out in 15 normal male volunteers performing 17 shoulder exercises derived from a shoulder rehabilitation program used by professional baseball clubs. The four rotator cuff muscles were studied, as well as other positioners of the humerus, including the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and three portions of the deltoid. The electromyographic activity was synchronized with cinematography and averaged over 30 degrees arcs of motion. An exercise was considered to be a significant challenge for a muscle if it generated at least 50% of its predetermined maximum contraction over three consecutive arcs (i.e., a 90 degrees range). Four exercises were consistently found to be among the most challenging exercises for every muscle. These shoulder exercises consisted of 1) elevation in the scapular plane with thumbs down, 2) flexion, 3) horizontal abduction with arms externally rotated, and 4) press-up. This study documents that the minimum for an effective and succinct rehabilitation protocol for the glenohumeral muscles would include these exercises.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to analyze how anterior tibial tunnel placement can result in graft impingement by the intercondylar roof. The relationship of the ACL to the intercondylar roof was studied using magnetic resonance scans. An attempt was made to predict the amount of bone that may need to be removed from the intercondylar roof to prevent impingement on a 10 mm thick ACL graft. Magnetic resonance scans of 19 normal ACLs were analyzed. The amount of bone removal required to correct roof impingement was determined for a graft placed either eccentrically or centrally within the ACL insertion, and within the bulk of the normal ACL fibers. An eccentric tibial tunnel placement required approximately 5 to 6 mm and a central placement required 2 to 3 mm of bone removal from the intercondylar roof to prevent impingement. Placing the graft within the bulk of the ACL fibers, just 3 mm posterior to the center of the ACL insertion, required little bone resection to prevent impingement. To prevent ACL graft impingement, roofplasties need to be performed in both acute and chronic ACL reconstructions if the presently accepted locations for positioning the tibial tunnel are used. A more anteriorly placed tibial tunnel requires more bone removal to prevent roof impingement than a more posteriorly positioned tibial tunnel.\r"

All manipulations were done under a spinal or general anesthetic and, in 10 cases, arthroscopic debridement of adhesions also was performed. The average time from reconstruction to manipulation was 7 months (range, 3 to 14 months) and the average followup was 26 months (range, 6 to 56 months). At manipulation, average flexion was increased from 95 degrees to 136 degrees and average extension from 11 degrees to 3 degrees. In no case was motion gained at the expense of joint stability and, at final followup, average flexion and extension were 127 degrees and 4 degrees, respectively. The final range of motion achieved was not affected by the time to manipulation, severity of premanipulation flexion deficit, or concomitant arthroscopic debridement of adhesions. However, knees with premanipulation extension deficits of greater than or equal to 15 degrees achieved significantly less final extension than knees with lesser premanipulation deficits. Overall, manipulations were a safe and effective method for improving both flexion and extension in 86% of the knees that had restricted motion after ACL reconstructions.\r"

The purpose of this study was to quantitate wrist motion and club head/ball impact force in subjects with pathologic conditions of the hand, wrist, or forearm, within a laboratory environment. A regular straight-handled golf club was compared to a new BioCurve handle design that has a 19 degrees ulnar bend. We measured and compared the effect of the two grips on wrist motion, club head velocity, ball impact force, ball impact location, and isometric torsional strength in 20 subjects who had a variety of upper extremity disorders. This data was then compared to data collected in an identical fashion from golfers without such conditions. The results of our study show that there were no differences related to club handle design on impact force or impact location, club head velocity, or club head path and face angle. Wrist kinematic differences were minimal between handle designs. The differences that were significant (P less than 0.05) centered around the decreased ulnar deviation of the left hand that resulted when subjects used the BioCurve handle design, which also allowed greater resistance to torque than the straight grip club. In addition to collecting objective data, we asked subjects for their opinions of the two grips. As a whole, the normal group and the group with pathologic conditions noted more comfort, improved grip, and less shock transmission with the BioCurve handle.\r"

The results show that isokinetic exercise can produce large loads on these joints, especially during extension exercises. The tibiofemoral compressive force (4.0 body weight) is approximately equal to that obtained during walking but it occurs at 55 degrees of knee flexion. Anterior shear forces (resisting force to anterior drawer) exist during extension exercise at less than 40 degrees of knee flexion, with a maximum of 0.3 body weight. Posterior shear forces (resisting force to posterior drawer) exist during extension exercise at knee joint angles greater than 40 degrees and during the flexion portion of isokinetic exercise. The maximum posterior shear force is 1.7 body weight. The patellofemoral joint can encounter loads as high as 5.1 body weight which are 10 times higher than during straight leg raises. These results suggest that isokinetic exercise should be used cautiously in patients with knee lesions.\r"

To elucidate the etiology of injury, we first selected three healthy male and three healthy female pitchers from a well-trained college team and analyzed their forearm movement by high-speed cinematography. This showed slight flexion of the elbow joints during wind-up motion, dorsal flexion of the hand joints upon releasing the ball, and extreme pronation of the forearms during the follow-through. We then took 8 mm CT scanning sections of the forearms. Using these images, we investigated shapes and areas of cross-sections of the ulna and its cortical and cancellous bones from the elbow to the hand joints. Our results reveal that the shapes of the sections are significantly different from circles at around the center of the ulna, and the cross-sectional areas are smaller in the middle one-third of the ulna than in other parts. These observations imply that fatigue fractures of the ulna in pitchers of fast-pitch softball must be torsionally induced, tending to occur at the middle one-third of the bone.\r"

In cercariae and schistosomula, MAb 31-3B6 bound electron-dense granules within the head gland and similar granules in the preacetabular glands. In adult worms, SMW 68 or related antigens were found to be widely distributed in tissues. Binding of specific antisera was most pronounced in the gut and tegument of male worms, but less so in subtegumental muscles. We conclude that SMW 68 is presented to the immune system in various ways during parasite development. The protective protein or epitope is excreted, and presented on the surface and in the cytoplasm at various stages of the life cycle. The relationship of the location of this protein to its role in protective immunity is discussed.\r"

For each group, there were comparable untreated controls. All nodules were removed six months after the last dose. After a single dose, the only significant difference from the controls was in the decreased proportion of female worms producing live microfilariae. After four doses, there were significant increases in the proportions of moribund/dead female worms and of live uninseminated females, when compared with the corresponding controls. There were also fewer male worms present, but this difference was not significant. Six months after the conclusion of the 4-dose regimen, the proportion of female worms producing live microfilariae was significantly lower than in the groups that had received a single dose.\r"

We analyzed the lymphocyte subsets of leptospirosis patients by immunofluorescence and their responsiveness to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Additionally, we investigated the effect of the patients' sera on normal PBMC proliferative response. We observed a decrease in the CD3+ and CD4+ cell subsets in patients with and without acute renal failure, or in percentage values alone in those who had recovered from renal failure. An increase in the number of B lymphocytes was observed in all patients, compared with controls. This increase in B lymphocytes was seen even in patients who had recovered from renal failure, when the number of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes had already returned to normal levels. The low PHA response observed only with lymphocytes from patients with acute renal failure suggests a suppressive effect. The proliferative response to PWM was comparable to controls, even in the patients with acute renal failure. This latter result and the expansion of the B cell number could be related to leptospiral-derived factor(s). We also showed that sera from patients with and without acute renal failure exerted some inhibitory activity on normal PBMC responses to PHA and PWM. Although the redistribution of lymphocyte subsets and the serum suppressor activity were related to acute renal failure and leptospiral factor(s), we suggest that the cellular immune system was not irreversibly affected, which is compatible with the good prognosis seen in the patients studied.\r"

Dugbe virus was localized in both unfed and feeding adults inoculated as nymphs or orally infected by capillary feeding, and in nymphs infected by capillary feeding. In non-feeding ticks, the main sites of DUG virus replication were the epidermis, hemocytes associated with loose connective tissue, and a small number of phagocytic digestive cells in the gut lumen. Virus infectivity in the hemolymph was associated entirely with hemocytes. Dugbe viral antigen or infectivity was not detected in the salivary glands until after the start of feeding. Viral titers in the salivary glands of feeding ticks were about ten-fold higher than in gut, ovary, or loose connective tissue. The level of infection decreased during molting and increased during feeding. Viral particles and pathologic effects were not detected in infected ticks. The primary site of trans-stadial persistence of DUG virus is the hemocytes. Tick hemocytes and other motile cells may be important in the transmission of persistent virus infection from one cell or organ to another by diapedesis.\r"

Prevalence rates for the three plasmodial species at initiation of the study ranged from 56% in the 0-4-year-old age group to 0% in individuals over the age of 40. Entomological surveys were conducted, enabling us to determine mosquito salivary gland-positive rates and entomological inoculation rates of 1.2 infectious mosquito bites per person per month for P. falciparum, 2.4 for P. vivax, and 0.3 for P. malariae. Cumulative incidence rates over the 16 weeks of the study, following radical cure of all volunteers, were 22.5% for P. falciparum, 12.7% for P. vivax, and 1.5% for P. malariae. The median baseline antibody titer against the immunodominant repetitive B cell epitope of P. falciparum or P. vivax circumsporozoite protein was significantly higher for volunteers who did not become parasitemic. Volunteers were selected for further study if they had evidence of being challenged with P. falciparum sporozoites during the study, based on a two-fold or greater increase in antibody titer against the immunodominant repetitive B cell epitope of the circumsporozoite protein. Resistance to infection was seen in six of 10 individuals who had high (greater than 25 OD units) baseline ELISA titers, compared with only three of 24 individuals who had low baseline ELISA titers (chi 2 P less than 0.02). A similar analysis for P. vivax did not show a significant correlation.\r"

The titers of specific IgG2 and IgG3 were significantly lower in cord than in maternal sera. All maternal sera had specific IgM. Of the seven P. falciparum-IgM positive cord sera, six were associated with malaria-related histological placental changes (MRHPC). In addition, higher titers of specific IgG1 in maternal and cord sera and of specific IgG3 in cord sera were associated with MRHPC. Similar P. falciparum antigens were recognized by cord and corresponding maternal sera in radioimmunoprecipitation and Western blot assays (n = 40). Sixteen of 20 cord sera and 15 of 20 paired maternal sera significantly inhibited in vitro parasite growth. The extent of inhibition did not correlate with the titer of specific antibodies. These data confirm the very effective placental transfer of anti-malarial antibodies. The presence of IgM in some cord sera raise the question of intrauterine sensitization to malaria antigens.\r"

The study was conducted in a single village in northeastern Irian Jaya, Indonesia, where half the residents were native to the province and the other half were transmigrants from areas of Java, where there is little or no malaria transmission. Five separate measures of susceptibility to the asexual parasitemia of falciparum malaria were derived from results of four months of biweekly surveillance of 240 volunteers. Increasing protection as a function of age among the Javanese was a consistent pattern among the five estimates of susceptibility. These age-dependent functions of protection were quantitatively parallel to those among life-long residents of Irian Jaya. When humoral immune responsiveness to ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) was measured by ELISA, a similar pattern emerged; the relative level of antibody to RESA increased as parallel functions of age among the two subpopulations. Acquired protective immunity against P. falciparum was not the cumulative product of many years of heavy exposure to antigen. Instead, the full benefit of protection appeared to develop quickly. The degree of protection was governed by recent exposure and age, independent of history of chronic heavy exposure.\r"

The annual incidence of malaria in this population during the study period was 25.8%. Malaria attacks were clustered, occurring more frequently than expected in certain individuals and housing groups and less frequently than expected in others. In one of these villages, the distribution of cases was examined in relation to locality and to the type of house construction. There was a strong association between the malaria incidence and house construction, independent of location. The risk of getting malaria was greater for inhabitants of the poorest type of house construction (incomplete, mud, or cadjan (palm) walls, and cadjan thatched roofs) compared to houses with complete brick and plaster walls and tiled roofs. Houses that were better constructed had a significantly lower malaria incidence rate (10.5%) than those that were poorly constructed (21.2%; P less than 0.01, by Student's t-test). There was also a significantly higher number of indoor resting mosquitoes collected from the poorly constructed houses than from those better constructed; the average (geometric mean) of mosquito densities found in houses of better versus poor construction were 0.97 and 1.89 per collection in the dry season, and 1.95 and 3.42 per collection in the wet season, respectively (P less than 0.05 in both seasons). This indicated that the higher malaria risk associated with poorly constructed houses was at least partly due to higher human-mosquito contact among their inhabitants.\r"

The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions, compared with one of 13,000 in the prophylaxis group, making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after mefloquine treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis. Therefore, certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine are recommended.\r"

There was a wide range in the individual values, and some lesions markedly enlarged in the first week of therapy. An initially healed lesion was defined as one that had greater than 80% re-epithelialized by the 1.5-month post-treatment followup. All Pentostam patients demonstrated this degree of lesion resolution (100% initial healing rate), but one patient showed evidence of relapse at the three month followup resulting in a 96% complete healing rate for the 12 month observation period. Patients in the untreated control group demonstrated a strikingly high rate of healing with 9 of 12 patients having re-epithelialized all lesions after 1.5 months observation (75% initial healing rate). The mean reduction in lesion size for the untreated patients was 56%, 29%, and 25% after one, two, and three weeks, respectively.

  ".W": "Multidrug-resistance (MDR) in neoplastic cells is frequently characterized by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (PGP), a 170 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that binds multiple cytotoxic drugs as well as calcium channel antagonists. Chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum appears to be analogous to MDR in neoplastic cells, where the induction of resistance with one drug confers resistance to other structurally and functionally unrelated drugs. To test the hypothesis that chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum and antimony resistance in Leishmania is mediated by a similar mechanism of MDR in mammalian neoplastic cells, a PGP-specific monoclonal antibody (C219) was used to determine the presence of PGP genes in resistant and sensitive Plasmodium and Leishmania parasites by indirect immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting procedures. These PGP-like components were detected in both drug-sensitive and -resistant Plasmodium and Leishmania cells. A 40-42 kDa component was observed to be greater in a chloroquine-resistant P. berghei (C line) than in a chloroquine-susceptible P line. Differences observed between Pentostam-resistant and -sensitive Leishmania promastigote clones and isolates included the increased expression of 96-106 and 23-25 kDa peptides in drug-resistant L. enrietti, and increased amounts of two different peptides in two drug-resistant L. panamensis clones (i.e., 96-106 and 43-45 kDa in WR-746-CL4, and 53 and 23-25 kDa in kDa) in amastigotes as in MDR KB carcinoma cells (KB-V1). Comparative indirect immunofluorescent studies suggested that a correlation existed between the degree of antimony susceptibility and the concentration of the moiety recognized by C219 in two L. panamensis clones. Binding of the C219 monoclonal antibody to the PGP-like component of Leishmania was blocked by Pentostam, while the binding of C219 to multiple-drug resistant KB-V1 PGP was not inhibited by Pentostam, regardless of the PGP concentration. This suggests some degree of specificity in the binding of Pentostam to the Leishmania PGP-like components. In addition, these studies have demonstrated that drug-sensitive Leishmania accumulate two to five times more 125Sb-Pentostam than resistant clones.\r"

Administration of ondansetron or placebo had no significant effect on vital signs. Ondansetron was an effective antiemetic in 78% (14/18) and placebo was effective in 28% (5/18) of the patients. Laboratory studies 24 h later showed no signs of hematologic, hepatic, or renal alterations.

Ondansetron significantly decreased the posttreatment nausea scores (vs placebo) without increasing sedation or producing changes in cardiorespiratory parameters. In the placebo-treated group, 92% of the patients experienced subsequent episodes of vomiting in the postanesthesia care unit compared with 51% of the patients in the ondansetron group. Finally, only 43% of the ondansetron-treated patients required a \"rescue\" antiemetic compared with 86% in the placebo group.

Patients recorded their degree of pain and nausea in the recovery room, in the same-day surgery stepdown unit, during the ride home, and upon arrival at home. The postanesthesia care nurse recorded the amount of fentanyl and droperidol needed to treat pain and nausea in the recovery room. Patients who received ibuprofen were more comfortable in the stepdown unit (P less than 0.05) and after arrival home (P less than 0.05) than those in the fentanyl group. Additionally, patients who received ibuprofen had lower nausea scores in the step-down unit (P less than 0.05); this may have been related to the lower total fentanyl dose in these patients. The authors conclude that ibuprofen may be a useful alternative to fentanyl for providing postoperative analgesia for outpatient surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Recovery and psychomotor performance were studied in 80 ASA physical status I-III adult patients undergoing outpatient surgery. Patients were divided into four equal groups: thiopental induction of anesthesia followed by desflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen (Th-DES-N2O/O2), thiopental induction of anesthesia followed by isoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen (Th-ISO-N2O/O2), thiopental induction of anesthesia followed by desflurane in oxygen (Th-DES-O2), and desflurane inhaled induction followed by desflurane in oxygen (DES-DES-O2). Patients were excluded from analysis if they required opioids or antiemetics postoperatively. The use of desflurane was associated with more rapid awakening compared with isoflurane (time to eye opening 9.45 +/- 0.67 min [Th-DES-N2O/O2] and 13.8 +/- 1.59 min [Th-ISO-N2O/O2], P less than 0.05). Psychomotor performance was measured using the choice reaction time and critical flicker fusion threshold. At 30 min after discontinuing anesthesia, five patients in the Th-ISO-N2O/O2 group and one patient in the Th-DES-N2O/O2 group were too sleepy to perform psychomotor tests. In addition, five patients who received Th-DES-O2 and one patient who received the inhaled induction and maintenance of anesthesia with desflurane in oxygen were too sleepy to perform tests at 30 min. Patients receiving Th-DES-N2O/O2 showed less impairment of choice reaction time than those receiving Th-ISO-N2O/O2. Critical flicker fusion threshold, however, showed no difference between groups. The use of thiopental was associated with delayed recovery. Compared with isoflurane, desflurane anesthesia is associated with more rapid initial awakening and less impairment of choice reaction time.\r"

Seventy otherwise healthy patients between 2 and 8 yr of age were studied. Anesthesia was induced with halothane or thiamylal and maintained with nitrous oxide and halothane. After induction of anesthesia, the patients were randomly assigned to group 1 (awake extubation) or group 2 (anesthetized extubation). Oxygen saturation was measured continuously and recorded 10 min before extubation and at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min after tracheal extubation. Supplemental oxygen was administered when oxygen saturation values were less than 90% while breathing room air. Oxygen saturation levels were higher in group 2 than in group 1 at 1, 2, 3, and 5 min after extubation. There were no differences between the two groups in the number of patients requiring supplemental oxygen. The incidence of airway-related complications such as laryngospasm, croup, sore throat, excessive coughing, and arrhythmias was not different between the two groups. We conclude that the anesthesiologist's preference or surgical requirements may dictate the choice of extubation technique in otherwise healthy children undergoing elective surgery.\r"

Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were measured before drug administration, just before induction of anesthesia, and every minute until surgical stimulation occurred. Glycopyrrolate, at the dose used, was significantly less effective than atropine in attenuating bradycardia during induction; neither glycopyrrolate nor atropine altered the incidence or degree of hypotension. Antisialagogic activity and side effects were comparable, except for significantly more flushing with atropine.\r"

Train-of-four stimulation was applied to the ulnar nerve at the wrist and the recurrent laryngeal nerve at the notch of the thyroid cartilage. Laryngeal response was measured as pressure changes in the cuff of the tracheal tube positioned between the vocal cords. The force of contraction of the laryngeal adductor muscles and of the adductor pollicis were compared after administration of 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg of succinylcholine. With 0.25 mg/kg, maximum blockade of first twitch (T1) was 66% +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM) and 45% +/- 13% at the vocal cords and the adductor pollicis, respectively (P less than 0.01). After 0.5 mg/kg, maximum blockade at the vocal cords (93% +/- 2%) and the adductor pollicis (84% +/- 6%) did not differ significantly. For both doses, time to maximal blockade was shorter for the vocal cords (0.9 +/- 0.1 min) than for the adductor pollicis (1.7 +/- 0.2 min; P less than 0.01). Time to 90% recovery of T1 after a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg was similar at the vocal cords (4.3 +/- 0.5 min) and the adductor pollicis (5.2 +/- 0.8 min) (NS). The ED50 was less at the laryngeal adductors (0.170 mg/kg) than at the adductor pollicis (0.278 mg/kg). It is concluded that, in adults, succinylcholine-induced blockade is more rapid and more intense at the laryngeal muscles than at the adductor pollicis.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed on 14 fentanyl-pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs to assess changes in myocardial oxygen supply/demand relations during intravenous infusions of phenylephrine (2.8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres. Myocardial oxygen and lactate extraction were determined. Myocardial oxygen consumption was calculated with the Fick equation. In series 1, measurements were obtained during phenylephrine-induced pressor responses. In series 2, measurements were obtained with aortic pressure maintained constant with an extracorporeal reservoir during phenylephrine infusion, so that coronary vasomotor responses could be assessed in the absence of increases in ventricular afterload and perfusion pressure. In series 1, the phenylephrine-induced increase in mean aortic pressure (+42%) was accompanied by proportional (60%) increases in myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption and with no change in the endocardium-to-epicardium flow ratio, oxygen extraction, coronary sinus oxygen tension and oxygen saturation, or myocardial lactate extraction. In series 2, phenylephrine infusion caused a transmurally uniform 15% decrease in myocardial blood flow combined with a 10% decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. The coronary arteriovenous oxygen difference increased modestly (+5%), resulting in small decreases in coronary sinus oxygen tension and oxygen saturation, whereas lactate extraction was unaffected. The present findings suggest that phenylephrine has a direct vasoconstrictor effect in the coronary circulation that is weak and completely overridden by metabolic autoregulatory mechanisms in response to pressure-induced augmentations in cardiac workload. The authors conclude that the myocardium is not at risk when phenylephrine is used to treat hypotension in patients with adequate cardiac function and coronary vasodilator reserve.\r"

To determine if dantrolene is safe to use in sepsis, two studies were performed. In study 1, 18 anesthetized dogs in which profound septic shock was induced with 5 mg/kg of intravenous Escherichia coli endotoxin were randomized to receive (30 min later) intravenous injections of 10 mg/kg of dantrolene solution, the diluent of dantrolene, or maintenance intravenous fluids alone. The use of dantrolene solution and the diluent of dantrolene resulted in similar but transient statistically significant increases in the cardiac filling pressures and cardiac outputs and decreases in the vascular resistances compared with the control dogs. In a second study, 185 rats were randomized into five equal groups. Groups 1, 2, and 3 received 15 mg/kg of intraperitoneal Escherichia coli endotoxin followed 30 min later by 10 mg/kg of dantrolene solution, the diluent of dantrolene, or normal saline. Groups 4 and 5 received normal saline followed by dantrolene or normal saline. The survival of groups 1, 2, and 3 was less at 24 h (P less than 0.0001) than that of either control group, but was not significantly different from one another. The results suggest dantrolene can be administered safely under clinical conditions where the cause of hyperthermia and shock cannot clearly be ascribed to malignant hyperthermia or septicemia.\r"

Animals were trained to escape an aversive unconditioned stimulus (electric foot shock) within 3 s after being exposed to a conditioned stimulus (light and buzzer). Immediately after training (first session), the animals were exposed to halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane for 120 min and were then tested again on the avoidance task (second session) 30 min after cessation of the exposure. The performance ratios [B/A] (i.e., A is the score in the first session, and B the score in the second) were compared between the anesthetic groups and their respective control groups. Performance ratios in the control animals ([B/A]c) did not reach 100% except for those corresponding to the 0.5 and 1.0 MAC (minimal alveolar anesthetic concentration) halothane groups. Four of the nine performance ratios in the anesthetic groups ([B/A]a) exceeded 1.0. [B/A]a exceeded [B/A]c by 18.7% in the 0.25 MAC halothane group (P less than 0.05), by 13.5% in the 0.31 MAC enflurane group (i.e., not significant), and by 17.3% in the 0.29 MAC isoflurane group (P less than 0.01). [B/A]a/[B/A]c decreased dose-dependently for each anesthetic group. These results suggest that low concentrations of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane may enhance the performance of ddN mice in acquired avoidance training performed 30 min after anesthetic exposure.\r"

However, it is not known whether the sweating threshold remains unchanged (e.g., near 37 degrees C), decreases along with the vasoconstriction threshold, or increases during anesthetic administration. Accordingly, the hypothesis that isoflurane anesthesia increases the thermoregulatory threshold for sweating was tested. Forehead sweating was evaluated in five healthy patients given isoflurane anesthesia. The sweating threshold was prospectively defined as the distal esophageal temperature at which significant sweating was first observed. Sweating was observed in each patient at a mean central temperature of 38.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C and an end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 1.1% +/- 0.2%. The interthreshold range (difference between vasoconstriction and sweating thresholds) without anesthesia is approximately 0.5 degrees C; isoflurane anesthesia increases this range to approximately 4 degrees C.\r"

All three anesthetics elicited dose-dependent reductions in contractile force and spontaneous pacemaker activity. The maximal developed tension observed in the presence of norepinephrine was not altered by the anesthetics and corresponding ED50 values increased only in the presence of 1.2 MAC halothane and 1.2 MAC isoflurane. The anesthetics did not affect (a) the maximal positive chronotropic effect of norepinephrine, (b) the ED50 values for its positive chronotropic effect, and (c) acetylcholine-induced negative inotropic and chronotropic actions and did not induce arrhythmic activity even in the presence of the maximally effective neurotransmitter concentrations. These findings indicate that in isolated guinea pig atria volatile anesthetics, in concentrations up to 1.2 MAC, do not alter the inotropic and chronotropic effects of norepinephrine or acetylcholine and do not induce arrhythmogenic action in the presence of the neurotransmitters. These data suggest that altered atrial responsiveness to adrenergic or muscarinic stimulation does not contribute to the development of anesthetic-induced cardiac arrhythmias.\r"

A five-compartment mammillary function was fit to the end-tidal and mixed expired anesthetic elimination data simultaneously using ordinary least-squares analysis. We assumed the compartments to represent the following tissue groups: lungs and pulmonary capillary blood (V1), vessel-rich tissues (i.e., liver, heart, kidneys, and brain) muscle, an unidentified fourth compartment, perhaps fat adjacent to well-perfused tissues, and fat tissues. The tissue volumes and perfusions estimated for these compartments approximated values from the literature. In general, the volume of the fourth and fifth compartments increased with age, and perfusion to the second and fifth compartments decreased with age. Aging delayed anesthetic elimination and increased the apparent volume of distribution at steady state. These observations are compatible with decreased tissue perfusion and an increase in the ratio of fat/lean body weight in the elderly. Our mammillary analysis described the behavior of less soluble anesthetics such as isoflurane well, but that of highly soluble anesthetics such as methoxyflurane less well.\r"

All patients breathed 1 MAC of anesthetic using oxygen as the carrier gas, and the measurements were performed in the absence of surgical stimulation. The durations of inspiration and expiration were significantly longer during sevoflurane than during halothane administration. Tidal volumes were larger in the sevoflurane group than in the halothane group. Occlusion pressure waveforms were also markedly different between the two groups. Occlusion pressure during the initial 300-400 ms tended to be less in the sevoflurane-anesthetized than in the halothane-anesthetized subjects. There was no evidence of an active Hering-Breuer reflex with either anesthetic. Mechanical variables of the respiratory system were essentially identical between the two anesthetics. We conclude that (a) the ventilatory effects of halothane and sevoflurane are different, (b) the difference in the respiratory timing and depth of breathing originates from the action of the anesthetics on the central respiratory neural network, and (c) the different shape of the tracheal occlusion pressure may be largely due to the different effects of halothane and sevoflurane on the muscles of the rib cage.\r"

Hemodynamic measurements were performed before and 10, 20, 30, and 60 min after starting to administer either nicardipine (n = 12) or nitroprusside (n = 12) (B, T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively); at the end of drug infusion (T5); and 10, 20, and 60 min later (T6, T7, and T8, respectively). Plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels were measured at B, T1, T5, T6, and T7. In addition, plasma nicardipine concentration was measured in five patients at T1, T2, T5, T7, and T8. As with nitroprusside, nicardipine administration (1-3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, after a titration dose of 4.7 +/- 1.5 mg) resulted in hypotension (up to -34% +/- 3%), a decrease in systemic vascular resistances (up to -49% +/- 4%), and increases in heart rate (up to +17% +/- 6%), cardiac index (up to +37% +/- 8%), plasma norepinephrine (up to +63% +/- 17%) and epinephrine (up to +232% +/- 68%) levels, and plasma renin activity (up to +336% +/- 207%). Ten and 20 minutes after discontinuation of the hypotensive drug, nicardipine led to persistent vasodilation and hypotension, which differed significantly from the hypertensive rebound observed after nitroprusside discontinuation, despite a similar increase in plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels. Our results indicate that after the infusion was terminated, the nicardipine-induced vasodilation was opposed to the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II and catecholamines, thus avoiding hypertensive rebound.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied a group of five asthmatic patients who inhaled an average of 326 micrograms/day of beclomethasone dipropionate equivalents for 50 months (range 36 to 62 months) and a control group of five asthmatic patients on OCS, who used 12.5 mg of prednisone equivalents daily for an average of 57 months (range 22 to 120 months). The ICS group's average bone densities relative to age and sex-matched controls were 99.7%, 99.2%, and 90.0% for the radius, spine, and hip, respectively. The OCS group's average bone densities relative to age-matched and sex-matched controls were 94.4%, 85.4%, and 84.5% for the identical sites. A dose-response relationship between the cumulative dose of ICS and the relative bone density was absent in the study group but demonstrable in the control group of asthmatics on long-term OCS therapy. These results suggest that ICS therapy, unlike OCS, may not induce bone loss at the doses used by our subjects. Further research is required to determine whether a single user of ICS with unusually low bone density measurements represents a biologic variant, or a subgroup of patients who are especially sensitive to the systemic effects of ICS.\r"

We have examined the effect of exclusive breast feeding and of feeding different infant formulas on incidence of atopic disease in a prospective randomized controlled study. Seventy-two infants were recruited into each of the following groups: cow milk whey hydrolysate formula (NAN/HA) conventional cow milk formula (Similac), soy-based formula (Isomil), and exclusive breast feeding for greater than 4 months. The cumulative incidence of atopic eczema, recurrent wheezing, rhinitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, and colic were noted. Skin prick tests and radioallergosorbent tests for IgE antibodies to milk and soy were performed. At 12 and 18 months of age, the incidence of atopic eczema as also that of all atopic symptoms was significantly lower and similar in the breast-fed and whey hydrolysate groups, compared with the cow milk and soy formula groups. IgE antibodies were detected more often in the cow milk and soy formula groups, especially the former. Among symptomatic infants, fewer skin positive prick tests were seen in the soy group compared with the cow milk group. Our observations show that among infants at high risk of developing atopic disease because of positive family history, exclusive breast feeding or whey hydrolysate formula is associated with a lower incidence and thus a delay in the occurrence of allergic disorders compared with groups fed conventional cow milk or soy formulas.\r"

The QUIDEL Allergen Screens (AS) are simple to use dipstick tests that measure allergen-specific IgE to ten of the most important regional allergens. We compared the results obtained by prick-puncture skin testing (ST) to those obtained with the AS on 103 patients with allergic symptoms. Of the 103 patients studied, there were 67 with positive skin tests, and 57 of those were positive by AS and ten were AS negative. Of the 36 with negative skin tests, 2 were positive by AS and 34 were AS negative. Compared with ST, the AS results gave a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 94% for identifying the allergic patient. Of the ten patients positive by ST but negative by AS, five were ST positive at the 1+ level; the other five were repeatedly negative by AS and confirmed negative by RAST. On an allergen basis, the ST and AS methods showed an 85% agreement. A subset of 24 patients from the foregoing group was studied for total IgE and allergen-specific IgE with products from both Pharmacia (P) and QUIDEL (Q). In this group of patients, skin test results gave seven patients negative and 18 patients positive to one or more allergens. While the overall Total IgE results were higher for ST patients, the Total IgE results alone did not effectively discriminate between ST-positive and ST-negative patients. The allergen-specific, however, results by both methods showed excellent agreement with the ST results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients with potentially fatal asthma (PFA) must be identified and then treated in a manner that will prevent potentially fatal episodes of asthma. Such management will not result in control of patients with PFA when the patient is not compliant with the medical regimen. We report and classify ten PFA patients according to the apparent psychologic abnormality that resulted in, or contributed to the noncompliance. Some of these psychologic abnormalities in patients with PFA such as adolescent noncompliance, prednisonephobia or bipolar affective disorders may be responsive to a combination of medical and psychiatric management. Other psychiatric diseases that may occur in patients with PFA, such as antisocial personality disorders or schizophrenia, may have a poor prognosis even with combined medical and psychiatric care. The managing physician should be aware of the grave prognosis in such cases.\r"

Safety evaluations included adrenal function evaluation by morning plasma cortisol concentration, response to ACTH stimulation, and 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion. There was no evidence of effects on adrenal function at any dose. The severity, nature, and frequency of adverse events were similar across all treatment groups, including placebo. Drug-related adverse events were consistent with local nasal irritation. The groups receiving fluticasone propionate showed greater improvement in nasal symptoms (obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching) than did the placebo group. The results demonstrate that fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray is safe in doses up to 1600 micrograms per day and effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.\r"

However not all patients benefit from this approach, with early recurrence and death still being encountered. To evaluate clinical as well as perioperative factors that might significantly affect the outcome of patients with completely resected colorectal liver metastases, we examined 116 patients who underwent resection between September 1987 and August 1989. Median follow-up time was 13.2 months (0.6 to 31.4 months). The overall survival rate was 91% at 1 year and 75% at 2 years. Median survival was not reached. Median disease-free survival time was 11.5 months, with 49.4% and 21.2% of the patients being free of disease at 1 and 2 years, respectively. By univariate analysis, site of primary colorectal cancer, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, size of metastases, number of metastases, length of operation time, percentage mean arterial pressure, number of hypotensive episodes, duration of hypotensive episodes, and whole blood transfusion significantly affected recurrence rate following resection. However only site of primary tumor, CEA, number of metastases, and number of hypotensive episodes remained significant in the multivariate analysis. The most significant single factor that affected recurrence rate was the number of hypotensive episodes during the operative procedure. It is concluded that hypotensive episodes, even when well controlled, should be avoided during operation to maximize the chances of cure and prolong disease-free survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a careful evaluation of tumor extension by preoperative computed tomography scan after intra-arterial injection of ultrafluid lipiodol and by intraoperative ultrasound examination reduced the recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma after resection, a series of 47 cirrhotic patients with a single tumor operated on from 1984 was studied. Alphafetoprotein level was less than 100 ng/mL in 26 patients (55%), size of the tumor was less than 5 cm in 28 patients (59%), and capsule was present in 30 patients (63%). The resection was performed with free margin measuring 1 cm or more. The overall cumulative survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 35% and 17%, respectively. Intrahepatic recurrence was observed in 28 patients (60%), located less than 2 cm from the resection margin in only four patients. The cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 3 years was 81% and was significantly higher in patients with tumor greater than or equal to 5 cm and in patients with preoperative alphafetoprotein level of greater than or equal to 100 ng/mL. In this series the cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 5 years was 100%. This high recurrence rate after resection, even with careful evaluation of tumor extension, indicates that liver transplantation might be envisaged for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Following gamma camera imaging, 103 patients underwent an operative procedure: 92 had primary or recurrent colorectal carcinoma, 1 patient evaluated for recurrence of colorectal cancer had a second primary malignancy (small cell lung), and 10 patients had no demonstrable evidence of malignancy. 111In-CYT-103 immunoscintigraphic findings were consistent with the pathologic diagnoses for 70% of patients with colorectal cancer and 90% of disease-free patients. Antibody imaging contributed to surgical decision making through the detection of occult disease (12% of patients) and the confirmation of localized, potentially resectable disease without regional or metastatic spread. Seven patients (6%) experienced adverse effects, primarily fevers and itching, and 33% of patients developed antibodies to murine immunoglobulin after administration of 111In-CYT-103.

The prospective evaluation of 49 such patients, with 31% followed for 48 or more months, forms the basis of this report. The major immediate postoperative challenge is control of diarrhea and weight stabilization. Chronically patients have an increased daily caloric requirement (mean +/- SE, 56 +/- 1 kcal/kg), not wholly explained by moderate steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion, 16% +/- 2% of unrestricted fat intake). Despite persistent malabsorption, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamin, magnesium, and trace element serum levels can be prevented in most patients. Pancreatogenic diabetes is characterized by (1) absence of the major glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, (2) instability, and (3) frequent hypoglycemia, with the latter parameters improving with rigorous home glucose monitoring. No patient has developed clinically overt diabetic micro- or macrovascular disease. Performance status in long-term survivors has been reasonable. However adverse chronic sequelae of the operation occur and include an unusual frequency of liver disease, characterized by accelerated fatty infiltration, and osteopenia, with an 18% reduction in radial bone mineral content noted in pancreatectomized patients studied more than 5 years after surgery.\r"

Sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture in rats led to a persistent elevation (p less than 0.05) of plasma TNF until 10 hours, steadily increasing (p less than 0.05) IL-1 plasma levels, and enhanced (p less than 0.05) IL-6 plasma levels at all time points compared to the sham group. Prostaglandin E2 plasma levels were elevated (p less than 0.05) at 5 hours (153 +/- 29 pg/mL; control: 47 +/- 11 pg/mL) and 10 hours (96 +/- 16 pg/mL; control: 21 +/- 5 pg/mL). Prostaglandin E2 production by splenic macrophages (sM phi) from septic animals was increased (p less than 0.05) at 5 hours (9.1 +/- 2.2 ng/mL) and 10 hours (5.6 +/- 1.5 ng/mL) compared to controls (3.3 +/- 0.3 ng/mL at 5 hours; 1.3 +/- 1.3 ng/mL at 10 hours). Incubation of sM phi from septic animals with ibuprofen enhanced (p less than 0.05) IL-1 and TNF synthesis, while IL-6 production was reduced (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that the alterations in prostanoid release and elevated plasma prostanoids may regulate the release and consequently the circulating levels of cytokines during sepsis.\r"

  ".U": "91328602\r", 
  ".W": "With the advent of cyclosporin A, accelerated coronary arteriosclerosis has become the major impediment to the long-term survival of heart transplant recipients. Due to epidemiologic reports suggesting a salutary effect of fish oil, the dose response of fish oil on graft coronary arteriosclerosis in a rabbit heterotopic cardiac allograft model was assessed using safflower oil as a caloric control. Seven groups of New Zealand White rabbits (n = 10/group) received heterotropic heart transplants from Dutch-Belted donors and were immunosuppressed with low-dose cyclosporin A (7.5 mg/kg/day). Group 1 animals were fed a normal diet and served as control. Group 2, 3, and 4 animals received a daily supplement of low- (0.25 mL/kg/day), medium- (0.75 mL/kg/day), and high- (1.5 mL/kg/day) dose fish oil (116 mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid/mL), respectively. Group 5, 6, and 7 animals were supplemented with equivalent dose of safflower oil (i.e., 0.25, 0.75, and 1.5 mL/kg/day). Oil-supplemented rabbits were pretreated for 3 weeks before transplantation and maintained on the same diet for 6 weeks after operation. The extent of graft coronary arteriosclerosis was quantified using computer-assisted, morphometric planimetry. When the animals were killed, cyclosporin A was associated with elevated plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the control group. While safflower oil prevented the increase in plasma lipids at all dosages, fish oil ameliorated the cyclosporin-induced increase in total cholesterol only with high doses. Compared to control animals, there was a trend for more graft vessel disease with increasing fish oil dose, as assessed by mean luminal occlusion and intimal thickness. A steeper trend was observed for increasing doses of safflower oil; compared to the high-dose safflower oil group, animals supplemented with low-dose safflower oil had less mean luminal occlusion (16.3% +/- 5.9% versus 41.4% +/- 7.6%, p less than 0.017) and intimal thickness (7.9 +/- 1.9 microns versus 34.0 +/- 13.0 microns, analysis of variance: p = 0.054). Low-dose safflower oil also had a slight, but nonsignificant, beneficial effect on graft vessel disease when compared to control rabbits. The same trends were observed in the degree of histologic rejection (0 = none to 3 = severe) in fish oil- and safflower oil-treated animals. Rejection score correlated weakly but significantly (p = 0.0001) with mean luminal occlusion (r = 0.52) and intimal thickness (r = 0.46). Therefore allograft coronary disease in this model appeared to exhibit an unfavorable, direct-dose response to fish oil and safflower oil, independent of effects on plasma lipids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Alpha-adrenergic drugs commonly are used to treat hypotension resulting from severe acute pancreatitis. It was shown previously that although systemic arterial pressure is increased by phenylephrine, pancreatic microcirculatory perfusion is decreased. Because inadequate tissue perfusion may be critical in the progression of edematous pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis, it was hypothesized that vasoconstrictors might be harmful in pancreatitis. Therefore the effect of phenylephrine on cerulein-induced mild pancreatitis were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 54) were randomly allocated to 6 experimental groups and subjected to the following infusion regimens: (1) cerulein (cae) + phenylephrine (phe), (2) cae + saline (NS), (3) NS + phe, (4) cae + phenoxybenzamine (pbz) + phe, (5) NS + pbz + phe, and (6) NS. Initial and terminal hematocrit, serum amylase activity, and blood ionized calcium concentration were determined. The animals were killed 9 hours after starting the infusion. Macroscopic and histologic changes were scored by a 'blinded' pathologist. Phenylephrine increased the severity of cerulein-induced pancreatitis as manifested by statistically significant adverse changes in serum amylase, hematocrit, ionized calcium, peripancreatitic soap formation, and acinar cell vacuolization. These changes were antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that phenylephrine is deleterious in acute experimental pancreatitis, the first demonstration of such an effect by a pharmacologic vasoconstrictor, and suggested that microcirculatory changes may be important in the transition of mild to severe pancreatitis. Caution in the use of vasoconstrictor drugs in patients with acute pancreatitis is recommended.\r"

Control and doxorubicin-treated (6 mg/kg, intravenously) rats underwent paired dorsal 5-cm linear wounds and had either vehicle or recombinant (r)TNF (0.5, 5, or 50 micrograms) applied locally to the wound. Paired wounds were harvested at 7 and 14 days after wounding and analyzed for wound-bursting strength (WBS) and activity of the gene for type 1 collagen and TNF. Doxorubicin treatment decreased WBS at 14 days but not at 7 days after wounding. Local application of 50 micrograms of rTNF decreased WBS in saline-treated rats and concentrations of 5 and 50 micrograms decreased WBS in doxorubicin-treated rats when measured 7 days after wounding. These effects dissipated when WBS was measured 14 days after wounding. Doxorubicin decreased wound collagen gene expression and local TNF treatment decreased wound collagen gene expression in saline-treated rats and further decreased it in doxorubicin-treated rats. The decrement in collagen gene expression induced by rTNF increased as the local dose of rTNF increased. The gene for TNF was not detectable in wounds from normal or doxorubicin-treated rats at 3, 7, 10, or 14 days after wounding. These data suggest that the gene for TNF is not expressed in wounds and that the local application of TNF is detrimental to wound healing as it decreases WBS and activity of the gene for collagen.\r"

This study tests the role of PMN in mediating the edema. Anesthetized rats received 10(6)U recombinant human IL-2 (n = 15) or vehicle (n = 14) as a constant intravenous infusion during a period of 1 hour. At this time there was leukopenia 3.63 +/- 0.43 (x10(3)/mm3) relative to vehicle-infused control rats 6.12 +/- 0.86 and a decline in PMN, 2.19 +/- 0.14 relative to control value of 3.33 +/- 0.05 (both p less than 0.05). After 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in the wet to dry weight (W/d) ratio, was present in the lungs (4.93 +/- 0.20 relative to control 4.06 +/- 0.10), heart (4.09 +/- 0.11 versus 3.76 +/- 0.08), liver (3.50 +/- 0.10 versus 3.18 +/- 0.10), and kidney (4.25 +/- 0.07 versus 4.00 +/- 0.07) (all p less than 0.05). There was increased lung permeability demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to control 460 +/- 90 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). Interleukin-2 resulted in lung PMN sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma TxB2 levels to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL relative to control 481 +/- 93 pg/mL (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment of other rats (n = 8) with selective anti-rat neutrophil antiserum 18 hours before the experiment led to a peripheral PMN count 10% of baseline and prevented edema in the lungs (W/d ratio 4.20 +/- 0.16) and heart (3.67 +/- 0.07) (both p less than 0.05) but not liver or kidney. Protein in lung lavage was reduced to 760 +/- 220 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). The protection afforded by leukopenia was associated with lack of PMN sequestration and prevention of the increase in plasma Tx levels (484 +/- 120 pg/mL, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the rapid induction of lung and heart edema with a 1-hour infusion of IL-2 in the rat is mediated, in large part, by activated PMNs.\r"

To determine alterations in leukocyte function after trauma, O2- production and GE secretion from neutrophils were studied in trauma patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 15). The priming effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on O2- or GE release also was evaluated. Superoxide production (nmole/10 minutes) was elevated significantly in trauma patients at days 0 (9.5 +/- 4.8), 1 (14.2 +/- 7.3), and 3 (12.2 +/- 5.9) and returned to control levels (4.2 +/- 1.6) by day 7. There was no difference in GE secretion between trauma patients and healthy controls. Incubation of neutrophils with TNF induced release of both O2- and GE. Superoxide production was induced by TNF at concentrations at or greater than 10(-11) mol/L. Granulocyte elastase secretion was induced in a time- and dose-dependent manner by TNF at concentrations between 10(-10) and 10(-7) mol/L. In contrast IL-1 alpha and LPS did not potentiate O2- or GE release. These results suggest that neutrophil O2- production increases acutely in trauma. Tumor necrosis factor may mediate this O2- and GE production by neutrophils involved in the inflammatory response.\r"

In June 1990, the Centers for Disease Control reported four clusters of postsurgical infections associated with the use of propofol. We describe one of those clusters, consisting of four cases of endogenous Candida albicans endophthalmitis. These infections occurred in nonimmunocompromised patients after they had undergone nonophthalmologic surgery in which propofol had been used as anesthesia. An investigation by the Centers for Disease Control concluded that the infections in these patients were due to extrinsic contamination of propofol during preparation for use at the hospital. Ophthalmologists should be aware of this new potential source of endogenous endophthalmitis.\r"

This cohort represents approximately one half of all persons who underwent cataract extraction under the Medicare program in 1984. Extracapsular extraction was performed in 195,587 (58%) of cases, intracapsular cataract extraction in 99,971 (30%), and phacoemulsification in 28,474 (8%). The risk of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis in the year following surgery was 0.17% for intracapsular cataract extraction compared with 0.12% for extracapsular extraction or phacoemulsification (P less than .002). The risk of endophthalmitis at 1 month was higher for intracapsular cataract extraction than for extracapsular extraction or phacoemulsification (0.11% vs 0.085%), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Cataract surgery accompanied by anterior vitrectomy increased the 1-month risk of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis to 0.41%, more than a four-fold increase over that for cataract surgery alone (0.09%; P less than .05). The rates of endophthalmitis at 1 year were 0.58% and 0.13%, respectively, for cataract surgery with anterior vitrectomy and cataract surgery alone (P less than .0001). No significant differences in the rate of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis were observed based on the use of an intraocular lens, age, or race. Endophthalmitis within 1 year of surgery was 1.2 times more frequent in men than in women (0.16% vs 0.13%; P = .03). Overall, the likelihood of postoperative endophthalmitis from a national sample is consistent with case series previously reported.\r"

Repeated, detailed examinations were carried out on selected subjects. Roughly half of all subjects with optic nerve damage from primary open angle glaucoma, regardless of race, were unaware that they had the condition. The average intraocular pressure (IOP) among black patients with glaucoma who were receiving treatment was virtually identical to that in those black patients who were not receiving treatment (median IOP, 20 mm Hg); treated eyes of white patients had a lower IOP than those eyes of white patients who were not receiving treatment (mean [+/- SD] IOP, 18.69 +/- 3.23 mm Hg vs 24.15 +/- 5.23 mm Hg; P less than .001). The risk of glaucomatous optic nerve damage increased with the height of the screening IOP, particularly at levels of 22 to 29 and 30 mm Hg and above (relative rate compared with IOP of 15 mm Hg or lower, 12.8 and 40.1 mm Hg, respectively). More than half of all glaucomatous eyes had a screening IOP below 21 mm Hg, whether these eyes were receiving treatment or not. The IOP in glaucomatous eyes tended to rise on follow-up, in contrast with nonglaucomatous eyes in which the IOP was as likely to rise as to fall. Results confirmed that IOP is an important factor in glaucoma, but did not support the traditional distinction between \"normal\" and \"elevated\" pressure, nor its corollaries, \"low-tension\" glaucoma and \"high-tension\" glaucoma.\r"

Mean intraocular pressure decreased 4.6 +/- 0.4 mmHg (20%) (P less than .001) at the end of the conditioning period. With cessation of exercise and subsequent detraining, intraocular pressure returned to elevated preconditioning levels by 3 weeks. Regular aerobic exercise is associated with a reduction in elevated intraocular pressure and may represent an effective nonpharmacologic intervention for patients suspected of having glaucoma.\r"

Aqueous protein concentrations were measured with a laser flare-cell meter. First, the value of the coefficient of protein entry into the anterior chamber (kin) was determined in both eyes of 10 normal subjects. One week later, aqueous protein concentration changes were measured in both eyes of the same subjects before and after instillation of timolol in one eye. From these changes and the value of kin, changes in the aqueous flow rate were calculated using an equation formulating protein kinetics in the anterior chamber. Results of a separate experiment showed that instillation of topical timolol did not change the kin, justifying use of the kin as determined without considering timolol in the calculation. The calculated flow rate had a maximum decrease of 30% +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM, n = 10) 4 hours after instillation in treated eyes and of 10% +/- 6% 3 hours after instillation in fellow, untreated eyes.\r"

A new quantitative method for assessment of macular edema using retinal thickness analysis was applied to 19 patients with diabetic macular edema. Foveal thickening was frequently coupled with poor visual acuity. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy and stereophotography detected 80% and 78% of local areas of thickening, respectively, but failed to detect locations with average thicknesses of 1.5 and 1.6 times normal, respectively. Fluorescein leakage on angiography was generally associated with retinal thickening, but locations with similar degrees of leakage had widely varying retinal thickening. Fluorescein leakage in the posterior vitreous correlated poorly with the degree of foveal thickening. These results indicate that quantitative measurement of retinal thickness may become useful in the management of diabetic patients with macular edema.\r"

Electroretinograms recorded during surgery on 10 patients with minimal retinal abnormality were evaluated for the effects of light adaptation caused by regular exposure to an operating light source or operating microscope. The fluctuations of the amplitude and peak time were small, indicating that this technique can be used to monitor retinal function during eye surgery.

The temperature in the vitreous cavity dropped to 27 degrees C to 28 degrees C after vitrectomies during which room-temperature solutions were used. This resulted in abnormal electroretinograph readings (markedly delayed peak times and reduced amplitudes). These results suggest that the routinely used room-temperature solution affects retinal function during vitrectomy; however, this functional change was reversible in patients having only minimal retinal abnormality.\r"

Animals were followed up for up to 44 days; untreated corneas and those treated with tetracycline developed no disease or \"fluffy\" stromal infiltrates with overlying epithelial defects representing an abscess. Corneas treated with the combination of tetracycline and corticosteroid usually developed crystalline stromal opacities that on histopathologic examination were shown to be intrastromal aggregates of cocci. Transmission electron microscopy of crystalline lesions within 10 days of infection revealed typical cocci intermixed with a fibrillar material having periodicity characteristic of fibrinogen or fibrin, and immunoperoxidase staining for fibrinogen was positive. By 1 month, electron microscopy revealed aggregates of degenerated bacteria that were surrounded by cellular processes of activated keratocytes. Our studies demonstrate a model for crystalline keratitis in which organisms are seen to reside within the stroma for up to 44 days without an inflammatory response. Periocular corticosteroids appear to be necessary to create this model. It is possible that the organisms are isolated from the host response by fibrin or by keratocytes.\r"

The relative order of resistance of bacterial biofilms was as follows: S marcescens was greater than P aeruginosa, which was greater than S epidermidis, which was greater than S pyogenes. Air drying of biofilms for 10 hours increased the efficacy of the disinfectant solutions, but drying was not enough to decrease the incidence of recovery to 0% for all solutions. Hydrogen peroxide was more effective against biofilms than disinfectant solutions formulated with chlorhexidine gluconate or polyquaternium-1 or polyaminopropyl biguanide. We recommend that determination of efficacy of contact lens disinfectant solutions should include challenges against biofilms.\r"

Five-day twice-daily 0.5% UK14304-18 administration reduced (P less than .05) intraocular pressure up to 49% in eight glaucomatous monkeys. In eight normal monkeys, 0.5% B-HT 920 and 0.5% UK14304-18 produced no alterations in outflow facility. Following unilateral application of 0.5% B-HT 920 or 0.5% UK14304-18, fluorophotometrically measured aqueous humor production was reduced (P less than .05) bilaterally up to 67% compared with baseline values. Also, 0.5% UK14304-18 reduced (P less than .025) systolic and diastolic blood pressure. UK14304-18 and B-HT 920 seem to reduce intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous production.

The focus was the neonatal cord platelet count, the parameter of greatest interest to obstetricians. None of the 61 infants had morbidity or mortality as a consequence of the thrombocytopenia. Only three of 61 infants (4.9%) had a cord platelet count that was less than 50 x 10(9) per liter. Although 66% of the infants had a further fall in the platelet count after birth, in all the thrombocytopenia could readily be corrected. Neither maternal platelet count, maternal treatment with corticosteroids, maternal platelet-associated immunoglobulin G level, nor maternal splenectomy could be used to predict neonatal thrombocytopenia. Fetal scalp platelet sampling was likely to lead to an erroneous decision. The rareness of a poor neonatal outcome raises the question of whether obstetric interventions are justified for every pregnant patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\r"

These formulas apply to any non-X-linked blood group system (including the ABO and Rh systems) and are simple enough for routine blood bank use in advising patients as to how likely they are to obtain compatible donors. Use of these formulas may be helpful in counseling patients who may have difficulty in obtaining compatible directed donors because of antibodies or an unusual blood type. In general, the presence of an alloantibody should not automatically exclude a patient from utilizing directed donors. Moreover, for patients with antibodies to high-incidence antigens, directed donations from siblings may be the easiest way to obtain compatible blood.\r"

Radiation exposure to the hand of the operator during coronary angiography was compared with and without the extension tubing. When corrected for the differences in exposure time, operator exposure was 5.38 mrem/min without the extension and 4.84 mrem/min with the extension. Although this is a small difference in exposure/min, a substantial reduction in exposure could accumulate over a 1 yr period. Insertion of this extension tube into the catheter system is a simple and safe way to further reduce operator exposure during coronary angiography.\r"

During the study period the ICD coding of death certificates indicated that 894 (25%) of the 3575 deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease. During this period the ambulance service received 17,749 emergency calls, which included 445 patients who had cardiac arrests outside hospital. One hundred and forty seven of these patients were carried by ambulances equipped with defibrillators and resuscitation was attempted in 83. Seven patients survived to leave hospital. The special ambulance service was cost effective--a simple calculation suggests that the cost per life saved was approximately 2600 pounds, but it seems unlikely that special ambulance services will materially affect community fatality rates from ischaemic heart disease.\r"

Blood examination included white cell count and estimations of haemoglobin, urea, glucose, and electrolyte concentrations and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. A firm diagnosis was established in 278 patients (38%). Pyogenic meningitis (n = 134), measles encephalopathy (n = 38), and electrolyte imbalance (n = 23) were important causes in this group, cerebral malaria (n = 4) was uncommon and there were no cases of Reye's syndrome. The diagnoses of the remaining 462 were combined under the heading 'acute unexplained encephalopathy'. Altogether 394 of the 462 patients underwent virological investigations for arboviruses and 92 (23%) had one or more indicators of Japanese encephalitis. No other arboviruses could be isolated. Throat swabs from 187 patients with acute unexplained encephalopathy were studied on monkey kidney tissue cell lines of which 14 were positive (8%). These were identified as adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, poliomyelitis, Coxsackie, and echovirus; in two cases the virus was untypable. Japanese encephalitis is an important cause of acute childhood encephalopathy in this region. Clinical features of the illness may be mimicked by several disorders which require specific treatment. Thirty four of the 92 died (37%).\r"

The PCR system afforded the sensitive detection of a broad spectrum of genital HPV types. Using PCR, we found that 46% of the study population was infected with HPV; the ViraPap test showed a prevalence of 11% infected. PCR analyses demonstrated that 69% of the HPV-positive women were infected at both genital sites. Subsequent HPV-type determination showed that 33% of the study population had HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, or other previously isolated types, and 13% had yet unidentified types. Almost all (92%) of the women diagnosed by Papanicolaou smear with condylomatous atypia or dysplasia (n = 12) were HPV positive. The PCR method proved to be an informative and rapid way to detect HPV in large numbers of clinical samples. Our results demonstrate that genital HPV infection is common among sexually active young women.\r"

In both diseases, the CD25+ cells are present as aggregates in the lamina propria below the epithelium, and constitute a large proportion of the lamina propria mononuclear cells. In Crohn's disease, but not ulcerative colitis, CD25+ cells are abundant in the submucosa. The CD25+ cells in Crohn's disease are 58-88% CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, indicating that they are T cells, whereas in ulcerative colitis the CD25+ cells are greater than 80% CD3-, CD4+, HLA-DR+, indicating that they are macrophages.

Morphine was detected in the blood of five persons (31%) and cocaine in the blood of three persons (19%) dying of 3-methylfentanyl overdoses; these were demographically similar to 99 other fatal overdose cases investigated by the county coroner from 1986 through 1988. This documents the contribution of 3-methylfentanyl to overdose mortality in an eastern city and the use of 3-methylfentanyl with other illegal drugs.

Complications were more common in the younger patient, especially neonates, and also in procedures that were ultimately unsuccessful. Most complications were transient and usually had no long term effects. Improvements in equipment design and technical expertise may reduce morbidity from these procedures.\r"

The haemodynamic profiles of seven patients with clinical cardiogenic shock after right ventricular myocardial infarction were studied prospectively. They were selected because all had a stable cardiac rhythm and none had absolute hypovolaemia during the study period. In all of them the mean right atrial pressure exceeded the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. After treatment with varying combinations of dopamine, dobutamine, and glyceryl trinitrate (titrated to achieve the optimum haemodynamic response) the mean systemic arterial pressure increased, as did the cardiac index. There was an associated increase in the left ventricular stroke work index but the right ventricular stroke work index was unchanged. There was no significant change in heart rate, mean right atrial pressure, or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. This suggests that the probable mechanism of the shock associated with right ventricular infarction is concomitant severe left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the value of emergency surgical standby for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. DESIGN--Retrospective review of the major complications of coronary angioplasty in a regional cardiac centre. SETTING--All angioplasties were performed in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory of Wythenshawe Hospital with surgical standby in an adjoining operating theatre. PATIENTS--1262 vessels were dilated in 1032 patients (mean age 53 years) between 1984 and 1989. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--In-hospital mortality from emergency surgical revascularisation after angioplasty; the rate of myocardial infarction and overall morbidity. RESULTS--Coronary angioplasty achieved primary success in 90% of cases. Thirty eight (3.7%) patients (five women (mean age 55.8) and 33 men (mean age 53.0] were referred for urgent surgical revascularisation--36 direct to operation and two within 24 hours. All patients survived surgery. Five of the 38 had had a previous angioplasty to the same vessel and one had had previous coronary artery grafts. Four of the 38 had an angioplasty for unstable angina. Eighteen had single, 13 double, and seven triple vessel coronary artery disease. The target vessel was the left anterior descending in 25, right coronary artery in nine, circumflex in three, and the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries in one. Five required external cardiac massage on the way to the operating theatre; two of them had a left main stem occlusion. Four internal mammary artery and 60 reversed saphenous vein grafts were implanted (1.6 per patient). Complete revascularisation was achieved in 36 (94.7%) patients. Q wave myocardial infarction occurred in six (15.8%). The final outcome was: none dead, three patients with angina, one late death, one cerebrovascular accident, one late operation for a new left anterior descending lesion, two patients on diuretics with or without an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. One orthotopic transplant was performed in a patient in whom cardiogenic shock developed after the left anterior descending coronary artery became occluded 72 hours after angioplasty. CONCLUSION--There was no surgical mortality and low morbidity among patients for whom immediate surgical cover was requested.\r"

  ".W": "A newly developed, highly sensitive immunoassay for creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was evaluated in 68 patients with or without different types of ischaemic heart disease. Patients were classified on the basis of clinical criteria in four groups: no ischaemic heart disease, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. Enzyme concentration in patients with stable angina was the same (even during exercise) as seen in the patients without ischaemic heart disease. Patients with unstable angina, however, could be divided into two groups. One group showed clear evidence of severe myocardial ischaemia by serial changes and higher mean values of creatine kinase MB up to 40 hours after the onset of symptoms, whereas in the remainder values were stable and resembled those seen in the patients without ischaemic heart disease. The changes in concentration correlated with signs of repetitive ischaemic episodes deduced from continuous ST segment monitoring during the first 24 hours after admission. These findings indicate that patients with unstable angina are a heterogenous group. In some, severe and prolonged ischaemia can be detected by a serological assay with high sensitivity.\r"

In all there was peripheral or central nervous system damage or both. Standard tests of autonomic function showed vagal neuropathy in seven. The remainder had normal autonomic function tests. Twenty four hour heart rate variability was measured as the standard deviation of the successive differences between RR intervals from an ambulatory electrocardiogram recording. Twenty four hour heart rate variability was significantly lower in both alcohol dependent groups than in controls, but the results in the two alcohol dependent groups were not significantly different from each other. The results of standard tests of autonomic function did not distinguish between the alcohol dependent men with normal autonomic function and controls. The differences in heart rate variability between this group and the controls may have been the result of the ability of this method to detect small changes in autonomic integrity. Cardiomyopathy may also account for some of these differences and such abnormalities should be excluded before results are to be regarded as a reflection of vagal function. Twenty four hour measurement of heart rate variability may be a more useful index of cardiac vagal neuropathy than currently available tests of autonomic function.\r"

Pulmonary microvascular permeability was measured non-invasively by a previously validated method of double isotope scintigraphy with indium-113m and technetium-99m. This permits calculation of an index reflecting transferrin efflux and thus, indirectly, the microvascular permeability. Fifteen patients with severe mitral stenosis (defined as valve area less than 1.0 cm2) were compared with a control group of 11 patients with mild coronary artery disease. The permeability index was significantly lower in patients with mitral stenosis than in the control group. Furthermore, the extent of reduction of the permeability index correlated with the severity of mitral stenosis as reflected by the Gorlin valve area. This finding may account for the relative resistance of these patients to pulmonary oedema despite chronic pulmonary venous hypertension.\r"

However, the pathway of activation by these antibodies is unknown and several potential mechanisms are possible. In this report, we describe studies investigating potential pathways of platelet activation by IgG antibodies. We tested 16 different IgG monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against a variety of platelet surface components and found that six antibodies were capable of causing platelet aggregation and release. These included MoAbs against glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, CD9, GPIV, and two other not well-characterized platelet components. There was no relationship between the number of platelet binding sites and the ability of an MoAb to activate the platelets. By adding intact and F(ab')2 preparations of the MoAb to control or Fc receptor-blocked platelets, we found that in all instances the MoAbs initiated platelet activation via interacting with the platelet Fc receptors. Clustering of the platelet protein components using a secondary antibody did not cause activation. Studies into the pathway of Fc-dependent activation demonstrated that the MoAbs were capable of activating platelets by occupying Fc receptors on adjacent platelets (interplatelet activation), as well as on the same platelet (intraplatelet activation).\r"

  ".U": "91329814\r", 
  ".W": "To determine a role for endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide (EDRF/NO) in regulation of human platelet reactivity by human endothelial cells (EC), we studied combined suspensions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HU-VEC, passage 2 through 3) and washed human platelets. Confluent HUVEC monolayers were treated with aspirin (1 mmol/L) to prevent prostacyclin (PGI2) formation, washed, and harvested. Aspirin-treated platelets alone (58 x 10(6)) were fully aggregated by thrombin at 0.05 U/mL or more. In the presence of 10(6) HUVEC, however, platelet serotonin release and aggregation in response to thrombin at doses as high as 0.5 U/mL were blocked. We demonstrated for the first time that inhibition of aggregation and serotonin release, due to EDRF/NO, occurred in parallel. HUVEC-dependent inhibition of platelet responsiveness was enhanced by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reversed by hemoglobin. The inhibitory effect was also reversed by preincubation of HUVEC with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA) or NG-nitro-L-arginine (NNA) through competitive blockade of arginine metabolism. Pretreatment of platelets with methylene blue indicated that EC-dependent inhibition of platelet reactivity occurred through activation of platelet soluble guanylate cyclase. When platelets and HUVEC were separated by a permeable membrane and both cells were stimulated by thrombin, platelets remained unresponsive. This indicated that inhibition was induced by a fluid-phase mediator, independent of direct cell-cell contact. These data demonstrate that EDRF/NO formation from L-arginine by human EC plays an important role as an aspirin-insensitive fluid-phase inhibitor of human platelet reactivity.\r"

The overall PB LAK activity against Raji cells was significantly lower in acute leukemia patients compared with normal controls (mean, 1,473 +/- 971 SD LU/10(8) LAK effectors v 3,340 +/- 1,862; P less than .001). The sensitivity of the blasts to autologous LAK cells was also significantly lower than to normal LAK effectors (517 +/- 593 LU/10(8) LAK effectors v 1,304 +/- 1,066; P less than .01). When the data were analyzed independently, four patterns of behavior could be recognized. The relatively largest group (9 of 26) included patients in whom effective LAK cells could be generated against the Raji line, but in whom the blasts were resistant to autologous PB-LAK effectors while being susceptible to normal LAK cells (defective specific LAK activity). In 5 of 26 cases, an incapacity to generate LAK activity against both allogeneic and autologous target cells was observed (defective LAK generation). In six further cases, the blasts were resistant to both allogeneic and autologous LAK populations, though the latter were effective against the Raji line (resistant blasts). The same defects could also be shown with bone marrow-derived LAK cells. Only in six cases did the leukemic blasts appear susceptible to autologous and allogeneic LAK cells. In four patients the analysis could be repeated at remission, and in three a restoration of the LAK function against the primary blasts was recorded. In the 10 cases studied at relapse, the blasts were resistant to autologous LAK effectors in nine and to normal LAK in seven. These data demonstrate that in most acute leukemia patients with active disease, a defect of the LAK machinery, either a deficient generation of LAK cells or the resistance of the blasts to LAK effectors, may be documented, pointing therefore to a possible contributory role of the LAK system in the control of leukemic cell growth. In view of the frequent normalization of the autologous LAK activity at the time of remission, immunotherapy with IL-2/LAK cells should be primarily aimed to patients with minimal residual disease.\r"

L-ferritin did not cause detectable specific binding, whereas H-ferritin showed a specific and saturable binding that increased markedly in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated cells. This ferritin bound up to 30% of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes and most B cells, indicating that expression of ferritin binding sites is not related to cell lineage or function. Dual-color flow cytometry experiments showed that ferritin binding sites were present on cells expressing the proliferation markers HLA-DR, MLR3, interleukin 2 (IL-2), and transferrin receptors (Tf-R). In addition, after PHA induction, the time course of the expression of H-ferritin binding sites was similar to those of the above proliferation markers. Ferritin binding sites were observed in lymphocytes at all cell cycle phases, including the early S-phase. H-Ferritin at nanomolar and picomolar concentrations had an inhibitory effect on PHA-induced blastogenesis. We propose that H-ferritin binding sites behave like proliferation markers, with the unusual function of downregulating proliferation.\r"

Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and extending cell survival by blocking programmed cell death. We examined Bcl-2 protein expression in 82 hematologic malignancies and reactive lymphoid processes. All lymphomas with Bcl-2 rearrangement demonstrated high levels of Bcl-2 protein. However, most follicular and diffuse lymphomas without Bcl-2 rearrangement also displayed intense Bcl-2 staining. In these cases, mechanisms other than classic translocation may be deregulation Bcl-2. The pattern of Bcl-2 staining in follicular lymphoma is the inverse of the pattern in reactive hyperplasia, confirming a role for Bcl-2 immunolocalization in routine diagnosis. Small lymphocytic malignancies, including small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle zone lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, expressed intermediate levels of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 protein varied in plasma cell dyscrasias. Bcl-2 protein levels in T-cell lymphomas reflected their corresponding stage of development. No substantial Bcl-2 was present in the Reed-Sternberg cells of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. Chronic myelogenous leukemia was strongly positive for Bcl-2, consistent with the presence of Bcl-2 in normal myeloid progenitors. Immunohistochemistry identified an expanded spectrum of hematopoietic neoplasms in which Bcl-2 may provide a cell survival advantage.\r"

  ".W": "Inositol phosphates (InsPs) and diacyglycerol (DAG) are second messengers derived via the breakdown of inositol phospholipids, and which play important signalling roles in the regulation of proliferation of some cell types. We have studied the operation of this pathway during the early stages of retionic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 myeloid leukemia cells. The autonomous breakdown of inositol lipids that occurred in HL60 cells labeled with [3H] inositol was completely abolished following 48 hours of RA treatment. The rate of influx of 45Ca2+ was also significantly decreased at 48 hours, consistent with the role of inositol lipid-derived second messengers in regulating Ca2+ entry into cells. The downregulation of inositol lipid metabolism clearly preceded the onset of reduced proliferation induced by RA treatment, and was therefore not a consequence of decreased cell growth. The generation of InsPs in RA-treated cells was reactivated by the fluoroaluminate ion, a direct activator of guanine nucleotide-binding protein(s) (G proteins) that regulate the inositol lipid signalling pathway. Subtle alterations to a regulatory mechanism may therefore mediate the RA-induced downregulation of this pathway. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the autonomous generation of inositol lipid-derived second messengers may contribute to the continuous proliferation of HL60 cells, and that the RA-induced downregulation of this pathway may, in turn, play a role in signalling the cessation of proliferation that preceedes granulocytic differentiation.\r"

However, relatively little is known about the antigenic specificities of naturally occurring anti-neutrophil autoantibodies. We investigated the possibility that anti-neutrophil antibodies specific for the neutrophil adhesion glycoprotein (GP) complex CD11b/CD18 might be present in the sera of some patients with autoimmune neutropenia. These membrane GPs have been shown to be highly immunogenic in the production of murine monoclonal antibodies against neutrophil antigens. Moreover, autoantibodies to the platelet membrane GP complex IIb/IIIa, another member of the integrin family of cell adhesion proteins, have been demonstrated in immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Sera from 50 patients known to have anti-neutrophil IgG antibodies were evaluated using an immunobead \"antigen capture\" assay, modeled after a method used to identify anti-platelet GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies. This assay detected anti-CD11b/CD18 autoantibodies in seven of the 50 sera. Each of these seven sera demonstrated decreased IgG binding to the neutrophils of a patient with congenital deficiency of CD11b/CD18. The patient with the highest levels of anti-CD11b/CD18 suffered recurrent skin infections and cellulitis, and died of respiratory failure during one of multiple episodes of pneumonia. Purified IgGs from five of these patients demonstrated effects on adhesion and/or opsonin receptor-mediated functions when tested with intact neutrophils in vitro. Our findings indicate that some patients with autoimmune neutropenia have autoantibodies specific for the functionally important neutrophil adhesion proteins CD11b/CD18. Our findings also raise the possibility that these autoantibodies may, in some cases, interfere with neutrophil function, thereby amplifying the risk of infection associated with neutropenia.\r"

We purified recombinant human MCP-1/JE (hMCP-1/JE) produced in COS cells and demonstrated that it is chemotactic for human monocytes with a specific activity similar to natural MCP-1. In addition, pure recombinant hMCP-1/JE stimulates monocytes, inducing an increase in cytosolic free calcium and the respiratory burst, but is completely inactive on human neutrophils.

  ".W": "Despite initial complete remission rates exceeding 70%, the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) eventually relapse. Improving the therapeutic results in acute leukemia requires detecting, and understanding the biology of, the minimal residual leukemia remaining after therapy and responsible for relapse. To investigate the biologic relevance of an in vitro assay for clonogenic leukemia (leukemia colony-forming units [CFU-L]) as a measure of minimal residual leukemia, we studied 58 consecutive patients with acute leukemia in complete remission undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with cyclophosphamide-based therapy. CFU-L were cultured from the pretransplant remission marrows in 45 of 58 patients: 35 of 43 patients with AML and 10 of 15 with ALL. Clonal rearrangements, identical to the patients' overt leukemia when available, were detected in the occult CFU-L from four of the eight patients with ALL in whom adequate DNA for analysis could be obtained from the CFU-L. None of the uncultured pretransplant remission marrows from the 15 ALL patients showed clonal gene rearrangements. We also determined the in vitro sensitivity of the occult CFU-L to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC), and correlated these results with the outcome of the patients. The sensitivity of the occult CFU-L to 4HC was the only factor that predicted relapse following BMT. The actuarial probability of relapse was 18% in the 23 patients whose CFU-L were sensitive to 4HC compared with 77% in the 22 patients whose CFU-L were resistant (P less than .001). The only factor that influenced the CFU-L sensitivity to 4HC was the type of leukemia. The CFU-L from the AML patients were more sensitive to 4HC than the CFU-L from the ALL patients (P = .001). Occult CFU-L genetically and functionally represent occult leukemia. Therefore, the CFU-L assay should provide a means for studying the biology of minimal residual leukemia and improving the therapeutic results in patients with acute leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Retroviral-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic precursors often results in only short-term gene transduction in vivo. Loss of the transduced genetic material over time may be caused by the limited ability of retroviral infection to transduce genes into early, pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Because fetal liver contains actively proliferating multipotential stem cells that should be more susceptible to retroviral-mediated gene transfer than quiescent cells derived from adult bone marrow, these cells may be an ideal target for gene transduction. Furthermore, physiologic expansion of these cells during development obviates the need for marrow ablation during gene therapy in vivo. We performed in utero gene transfer by injecting high titer replication-defective retrovirus in vivo into the livers of 11, 14, 16, and 18 day gestation rats. After birth, the rats were analyzed for the presence of proviral integration and gene expression. The efficiency of gene transfer into bone marrow cells was greatest in rats infected at day 14 to 16 of gestation. In rats killed at 1 to 26 weeks of age, gene transfer was detected by Southern analysis in 48% and by polymerase chain reaction in 86% of bone marrow samples. The provirus was also detected in white blood cells, the granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit, thymus, spleen, liver, and lung. The presence of the transgene in bone marrow and other hematopoietic tissues at 26 weeks of age suggests that early hematopoietic precursors present in the fetal liver are susceptible targets for gene transfer and that these cells become resident in the bone marrow of the adult animal. This model is a new technique for gene transduction into proliferating hematopoietic cells in vivo that avoids bone marrow transplantation and has potential application in the correction of genetic defects in utero.\r"

  ".U": "91329835\r", 
  ".W": "Fc receptors are important effector molecules of neutrophilic granulocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMN]), connecting phagocytic cells and the specific immune response. Neutrophils from healthy donors express the low-affinity receptors for IgG Fc gamma RII (CD32) and Fc gamma RIII (CD16), but not the high-affinity receptor Fc gamma RI (CD64). The latter has been found on neutrophils from patients with certain bacterial infections and can be induced in vitro after incubation with interferon-gamma. We show here that neutrophils strongly express Fc gamma RI after in vivo application of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). PMN from patients receiving rhG-CSF displayed higher cytotoxicity against Daudi lymphoma cells in vitro compared with control patients and with healthy donors. Fab fragments against Fc gamma RII (monoclonal antibody [MoAb] IV.3) inhibited neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity of healthy donors but not of patients during rhG-CSF therapy. Therefore, expression of Fc receptors by PMN was investigated by flow cytometry and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was compared. After staining with MoAb 32.2 against Fc gamma RL, the median MFI of neutrophils from G-CSF patients (median, 4.78; range, 2.40 to 8.50; n = 5) was significantly higher (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively) than the median MFI of patients not receiving G-CSF (median, 1.23; range, 1.01 to 1.58; n = 6) and the median MFI of healthy donors (median, 1.04; range, 0.67 to 1.12; n = 6). Fc gamma RI disappeared after the discontinuing of the G-CSF injections, but was reinduced during the next treatment cycle with rhG-CSF. The high expression of Fc gamma RI during rhG-CSF therapy correlated with enhanced cytotoxicity. In vitro incubation with rhG-CSF also enhances cytotoxicity, but only minor increments in Fc gamma RI expression were observed. Thus, during in vivo application of rhG-CSF neutrophils acquire an additional potent receptor for mediating tumor cell killing in vitro by induction of the high-affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI, CD64).\r"

  ".W": "Heterozygosity for protein C deficiency is associated with thromboembolic episodes, but clinical symptoms are nonrandomly distributed among protein C deficient families. This finding has led to the provisional definition of clinically dominant and clinically recessive protein C deficiency. We report here the molecular basis of hereditary, clinically dominant protein C deficiency in a panel of 40 Dutch probands from apparently independent families. All but one subject was a heterozygote for a point mutation in the protein C gene. These 39 subjects shared 15 mutations, six of which occurred in more than one proband (between two and nine). The diversity in the 15 mutations, together with the observation that the most frequent Dutch mutation was also found in a Swedish family with clinically recessive protein C deficiency, makes it unlikely that the molecular basis of protein C deficiency will be different between the clinically dominant and recessive forms. The recurrence of one of the mutations is most likely due to a founder effect, which suggests that when an additional hereditary factor is involved in the clinical severity of protein C deficiency this factor may remain linked to the protein C gene over many generations.\r"
