The patient was subsequently resuscitated and developed cardiac enzyme elevation without ECG changes, indicating a nontransmural myocardial infarction. Although controlled studies have not shown any ill effects of rectal examination in patients with acute myocardial infarction, there have been multiple case reports of bradycardia, ectopy, and ventricular arrhythmias resulting from rectal examination. The postulated etiology of the ectopy is twofold; increased vagal tone from rectal parasympathetic innervation or increased sympathetic tone from anxiety-stimulated catecholamine release. Rectal examination is definitely indicated in a subset of patients including those with gastrointestinal or genitourinary complaints, unexplained hypotension or anemia, trauma, and neurological deficits, and those who will receive anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy. In the remaining patients, the decision must be made on a case-by-case basis. Awareness of and precautions for possible ill effects of the examination are prudent.\r"

A computer program that provides an easily accessible, concise set of information to assist in the management of medical emergencies is described. It provides size- and age-specific endotracheal tube sizes, drug doses, continuous intravenous (IV) drug infusion preparation instructions, and emergency management guidelines for pediatric and adult patients with one of several acute emergencies. These emergencies include asystole, respiratory failure, anaphylaxis, shock, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures due to several common causes, and rapid sequence anesthesia induction. The use of this program was shown to reduce the time required for the preparation and administration of emergency therapy while minimizing management errors. A lap-top computer running this program may be a worthwhile addition to emergency departments and hospital resuscitation carts as a resource, especially for physicians less experienced in the care of children.\r"

  ".W": "Both academic and economic goals must be served by the academic health center. In response to ongoing stresses on medicine, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Hospital rapidly developed and implemented an expanded system of medical care. Vertical integration included provision of both acute and chronic care facilities and both primary and specialty care, as well as insurance products, in particular a health maintenance organization. Horizontal integration was accomplished by acquisition of or affiliation with other hospitals. The realignment of medical resources and patients shifted the locus of medical education somewhat, from the traditional hospital setting to the ambulatory care setting (in which many students and residents will eventually practice anyway). In addition, many physicians in the new settings are not traditional Johns Hopkins faculty members. Results of educational efforts in these altered circumstances so far have been mixed, partly because the capacity of the individual center to train students and residents is necessarily limited, and the fragmentation of the system makes inevitable problems of quality control and management. These issues are being worked out. The drain on faculty resources for research imposed by the need to expand clinical practice has been offset by a system of awards for research to faculty members. Efforts are being made to sustain the excellence of the traditional Johns Hopkins faculty's reputation while assuring doctors newly affiliated with the Hopkins system that they are no less important to the system. Opportunities to learn and to teach more economical medicine while retaining quality are discussed.\r"

First-year students' perceptions one year before the curriculum revision were compared with first-year students' perceptions two years after the introduction of the new curriculum. In the new curriculum, students reported better overall quality of the learning environment (p = .019), a trend toward fewer stresses (p = .091), no difference in social supports (p = .721), better mental well-being (p = .043), and a trend toward better social well-being (p = .099). Students at a comparison school that did not undergo curriculum revision did not have more favorable perceptions during the study period. The findings suggest that well-considered and well-executed efforts to improve the quality of a medical school's learning environment can be successful and can raise students' perceptions of their overall well-being.\r"

The authors measured cognitive and skills performances of 45 sleep-deprived pediatrics residents by using questions like those on the pediatrics board certification examination and using patient-care tasks that required coordination and dexterity. The residents were randomly divided into two groups--one stayed awake for 24 hours, the other for 34 hours--and were tested on cognitive and skills performances before and after sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation did not have a significant effect on cognitive performance. Of the three skills tested, the residents overall needed more time to perform umbilical artery catheterization, but the group deprived of sleep for 34 hours performed vein cannulation more quickly than the group deprived for 24 hours. Implications for these findings are discussed in the context of the ongoing controversy over the structure and process of medical education.\r"

The authors undertook a survey of departments of internal medicine to obtain and assess information about requirements for ambulatory clinical experiences for medical students. The results show that few departments (24% of the 101 departments responding) required ambulatory care experiences for undergraduates. Most of the required programs had a goal of broad exposure to ambulatory-patient problems; almost none had special educational interventions to complement students' care of patients. The experiences that were incorporated into the clerkship in a single block of time were more favorably rated than the experiences that occurred intermittently throughout the clerkship. Inability to provide continuity-of-care experience was an important concern of the departments. Most programs had logistical problems, the most serious and frequently cited being the lack of faculty time for teaching. The authors raise concerns about the educational effectiveness of many existing programs and, given the problems with faculty involvement, about the long-term viability of these programs.\r"

Eighty-eight questionnaires (65.2%) were returned, and 48 schools (54.5%) indicated they possessed written noncognitive criteria. Those schools having noncognitive criteria were asked to submit the criteria for review and were questioned about their reasons for establishing such criteria. Those schools not having noncognitive criteria were asked whether they perceived a need for such criteria and had plans for developing them. The study showed an increasing trend to create criteria that assist in administrative actions when problems arise. In the 31 sets of noncognitive criteria submitted for the study, the rank order of specific expectations was, from most to least frequently mentioned: honesty, professional behavior, dedication to learning, appearance, respect for law, respect for others, confidentiality, aid to others, substance abuse, and financial responsibility. The authors make recommendations for schools wishing to create noncognitive criteria and explain why they feel such criteria should receive the recognition and importance given to cognitive criteria.\r"

We tested the independent effects of dietary calcium (Ca; 500 mg twice daily), potassium (KCl; 20 mEq three times daily), sodium-potassium dependent ATPase inhibition (digoxin), calcium channel blockade (nifedipine), and placebo, on acute natriuresis in 14 normal subjects while receiving 150 mEq/d sodium diets and 2 L normal saline intravenously over four hours. Each subject received each regimen in random sequence. Sodium balance before infusion was not different among the regimens. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was increased in subjects receiving nifedipine, while the plasma aldosterone concentration (PA) was not different among the regimens. None of the regimens influenced the clearance of inulin or paraaminohippurate (PAH) either before or after saline infusion. Only KCl and nifedipine affected sodium excretion compared to controls. KCl and nifedipine increased the amount of sodium excreted after the infusion was terminated. In the case of nifedipine, this natriuresis was sufficient to increase the 24-hour sodium excretion on that day to above that of the other regimens. The data support the notion that potassium and nifedipine may decrease blood pressure by facilitating sodium excretion. Nifedipine may also uncouple renin from aldosterone. Oral calcium supplementation and sodium-potassium dependent ATPase inhibition did not facilitate natriuresis.\r"

Other studies have described factors that increase calcium uptake in vascular tissue. In this study, we attempted to confirm, and thereby correlate, the presence of both types of factors in SHR plasma. Intravenous infusion or bolus administration of dialyzed SHR plasma consistently induced an increase in blood pressure in normotensive rats. This hypertensive response was somewhat delayed, with peak blood pressures occurring 45 minutes after bolus administration and 90 minutes after infusion of SHR plasma. Spontaneously hypertensive rat plasma also increased 45Ca uptake in isolated normotensive rat tail arteries in a dose-dependent manner, with a time course similar to that for the hypertensive response to bolus administration. These findings suggest, therefore, that a substance exists in SHR plasma that can increase intracellular calcium in vascular tissues and thereby increase blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted to determine whether a difference in receptor-induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis occurred in aorta from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) v Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, and whether such a difference was correlated with contractile response. Basal incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol diphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidic-acid (PA) was not different between SHR and WKY groups. However, after five minutes of norepinephrine (NE; 10 mumol) exposure, increases in 32P labeling were markedly lower in SHR arteries. The percentage decrease amounted to 45% for PI, 68% for PIP, 100% for PIP2 and 58% for PA. Basal incorporation of 3H-myo-inositol into inositol monophosphate (IP) was similar for SHR and WKY groups. However, after 30 minutes of NE (10 mumol), SHR arteries failed to show an increase in 3H-IP levels, whereas labeling was increased 219% in WKY arteries. The contractile response of SHR arteries to 10 mumol NE showed a marked reduction in the rate of development of the tonic phase that has previously been shown to be supported by activity of protein kinase C. Higher Ca2+ levels failed to augment the SHR response, whereas WKY responses were significantly increased. Contractions in the presence of the phorbol ester tetradecanoylphorbolacetate exhibited a similar reduction in NE-induced tonic phase tension. These results indicate an impairment in SHR arteries at the level of receptor-induced formation of inositol cycle second messengers, possibly due to elevated basal levels of protein kinase C. These differences may be important in explaining altered vascular responses in primary hypertension.\r"

Media levels of VP and OT were measured at 1, 3, 4, and 7 days of culture. After three days of culture, the PVN explants from SHR secreted significantly less VP and OT (both reduced 80%) than did those from WKY. Release of both VP and OT in the SON explants was significantly lower (approximately 50% lower) in the SHR only at seven days of culture. Additionally, tissue content of the peptides was measured after 0, 1, 4, and 7 days of culture. Tissue content of VP and OT was decreased (40% or more) in the SHR in both nuclear regions after four and seven days of culture. In addition, nicotine was found to stimulate the release of VP from SON, but not PVN, cultures in both SHR and WKY explants. Immunohistochemical data showed that there was not a preferential loss of VP or OT neurons in explants from the SHR. Therefore, this in vitro model would indicate that there is a difference in the ability of cultured explants of PVN and SON from SHR and WKY (four-week-old) to synthesize and/or release the peptide hormones VP and OT.\r"

We used strain gauge plethysmography to study forearm hemodynamics in adolescents. Ten normotensive males (N) were compared to ten males with borderline hypertension (H). Measurements of forearm blood flow (FBF) were obtained after supine rest, during ten minutes of mental stress (mental arithmetic) and five minutes post stress. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) were calculated. The H maintained higher MAP and FVR (P less than or equal to .05) throughout the study. The vascular response patterns were assessed by comparing the slopes of the linear regression equation FBF = a ln FVR + b (where a = slope and b = intercept). From baseline to stress, the N exhibit a significant change in slope (P less than .05), shifting to a decrease in FVR per unit FBF change. However, the H maintain a constant slope and FVR per unit FBF change remains constant. The study suggests that a primary peripheral vascular abnormality may be present even in the young with marginally elevated BP.\r"

Previous studies have shown that Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats with severe hypertension have elevated glomerular pressures and develop extensive FGS. In the present study, we determined whether Dahl S rats exhibit other risk factors for FGS. Dahl S rats were found to have elevated serum triglycerides at six weeks of age, compared to Dahl salt-resistant (R) rats. Between six and 24 weeks, systemic hypertension and progressive increases in both serum lipids and albuminuria occurred in Dahl S rats fed high salt (4% NaCl) chow. No changes in blood pressure or serum lipids occurred in Dahl R rats fed high salt. At 30 weeks, the incidence of FGS was 20 times greater in hypertensive Dahl S than in Dahl R. In a separate study, we compared risk factors for FGS in Dahl S rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The magnitude of glomerular capillary pressure, serum lipid levels, and urine albumin excretion were measured in male Dahl S rats and male SHR between 12 and 20 weeks of age. Normal values for the various parameters were established in a group of normotensive male Sprague-Dawley rats. For this study, all rats were fed standard chow containing 0.6% NaCl. Blood pressure was elevated (P less than .01) in Dahl S (142 +/- 2 mm Hg) and in SHR (173 +/- 3 mm Hg) compared to the Sprague-Dawley rats (117 +/- 3 mm Hg). Glomerular capillary pressure, however, was similar in all three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Correction is often mandatory prior to blepharoplasty in that functional problems may be worsened without elevating the brow. Direct and coronal browlifts are the most common approach to the problem. Midforehead browlifts have been reserved for men with receding hairlines. We have, for the past three years, performed midforehead browlifts on all our patients needing ptotic brow correction. Our review of 72 patients treated in this way, including 52 women, shows excellent and long-lasting cosmetic and functional improvement. There have been few complications, and the resultant incisional scars have been very well accepted. Therefore, we feel that the midforehead browlift, performed as we describe, is the ideal surgical correction for the ptotic brow.\r"

Pentoxifylline has been shown to improve the deformability of red blood cells by increasing their intracellular adenosine triphosphate content and, therefore, improving their flow properties. This is especially important in ischemia and low blood flow states present in the distal portions of random skin flaps. The rheologic properties of pentoxifylline were studied in the swine model. Swine in group I (eight flaps) served as controls with no pharmacologic manipulations. Swine in group II (16 flaps) received pentoxifylline (20 mg/kg/d) for ten days preoperatively and ten days postoperatively. Necrosis in swine in group I (controls) averaged 32.6%, which substantiated previous reports. Necrosis in swine in group II (pentoxifylline) averaged 2.57%. This study has shown a statistically significant enhancement of random skin flap survival using pentoxifylline in a swine model.\r"

Nutritive blood flow studies performed after skin expansion and elevation show augmented blood flows similar to those seen in conventionally delayed skin flaps. We utilized dermofluorometric analysis to study acute blood flow changes in sequentially, rapidly expanded porcine skin. Four subcutaneous pockets were developed in each of six pigs. The pockets were divided into the following three groups: (1) those with placement of a tissue expander inflated sequentially to 300 mL over four days and then totally deflated on day 6, (2) those with placement of a tissue expander that was not inflated, and (3) those with no tissue expander placed. Measurements were taken immediately before and after tissue expander manipulation in group 1 and daily in groups 2 and 3. Fluorescence was determined at points over and 4, 7, and 10 cm distal to the expander. Blood flow decreased immediately after skin expansion in areas over the tissue expander on days 0 and 1 and returned to baseline levels within 24 hours. Blood flow increased after tissue expander deflation on day 6 but returned to predeflation levels within 24 hours. Capillary blood flow increased over the duration of the study in all three groups. There was no significant difference in blood flow between and among the three groups on day 8, nor was there a significant difference in blood flow between and among sites over and distal to the tissue expander.\r"

Like other autogenous grafts, the pericranium may eventually undergo some resorption; however, with experience, overcorrection can be planned. The graft is convenient and easy to harvest, with little or no defect at the donor site. With a mean follow-up of 13.6 months, rejection or infection has not been experienced to date.\r"

Superoxide dismutase, a free radical scavenger, and allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (a catalyst in the formation of superoxide) have been shown separately to decrease ischemic damage to tissue. Sixty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats (220 to 280 g) were divided into five groups: control, superoxide dismutase only, allopurinol only, high-dose combined allopurinol and superoxide dismutase, and low-dose combined allopurinol and superoxide dismutase. An 18-cm2 ventral island skin flap, based on a single inferior epigastric vessel, was raised and replaced. Blood flow was assessed with a perfusion fluorometer immediately after the flap was replaced, and on postoperative days 1 and 3. Gross necrosis was assessed on postoperative day 7. Gross necrosis was reliably reduced in all groups as compared with the control; however, necrosis in any one experimental group was not significantly different from any other experimental group. Necrosis (expressed as a percentage of the area of the random [distal] half of the flap) was as follows for each group: control, 74%; superoxide dismutase, 43%; allopurinol, 43%; high-dose combined, 48%; low-dose combined, 33%. Blood flow, as represented by the dermofluorescence index, was not changed by any of the treatments. Blood flow was also related to the eventual survival or necrosis for any one portion of tissue. All experimental groups survived with significantly less blood flow than the control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No patient with normal intraocular pressure was found to have an ocular injury. In a prospective study, the intraocular pressures of 30 patients sustaining orbital fractures were measured. Twelve patients (40%) had normal (less than 22 mm Hg) and bilaterally symmetric (less than 3 mm Hg difference) intraocular pressures. One (8%) of these patients sustained ocular injury. In contrast, 18 patients (60%) had either an elevated intraocular pressure (greater than 22 mm Hg) or a difference between eyes of greater than or equal to 3 mm Hg. Eleven (61%) of these patients were found to have sustained an ocular injury. We conclude that intraocular hypertension or significant interocular pressure differences should alert the physician to a potential ocular injury.\r"

The clavicular division technique was devised to increase the length of the flap to help alleviate this problem. Thirty pectoralis major muscle flaps were dissected in fresh cadavers, using the clavicular division technique. The length of the flap after transposition was measured and recorded before and after clavicular division. The distance from the sternal notch to the clavicular division point was also recorded. The average gain in length was found to be 2.9 cm, with a range of 0.5 cm to 6.5 cm. The clavicular division technique has been used since in five patients. The increase in length has allowed us to discard some or all of the random portion of the flap. We advocate the use of this procedure on any patient where the surgeon is concerned about the viability of the random portion of the flap and/or when it is felt that the tension on the suture line is excessive.\r"

Angiography showed arterial supply mainly from the right external carotid artery, but also from the right internal carotid artery and the left external carotid artery. The process was diagnosed as a juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. In spite of two attempts at resection of the tumor and arterial embolization, the tumor progressed intracranially. Further operative attempts were decided against, and the patient was followed with repeated computed tomographic scans.

Exhaustive data on the subject, which offer accurate results on patient dosimetry for the different types of examination, are the final aim of the project. So far, it has been possible to analyse in detail the data from the National Institute of Health (NIH), which manages the care of about 96% of the Spanish population, plus the findings from several hospitals, outpatient centres and private clinics of the community of Madrid, which allowed us to perform the first dose estimations and to extrapolate them to the rest of Spain. The following estimations are presented: annual frequency of different examinations, their variation from 1985 to 1986, number of diagnostic rooms used for a given minimum of annual examinations, organ doses for different examinations, effective dose-equivalent, genetically significant dose for some examinations, as well as the collective dose.\r"

Using this technique in 441 examinations, transient diverticula have been observed in 18 patients (4.1%). They exhibit many features of established diverticula which suggests that they represent an incipient stage of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the cell kinetics of the follicular epithelium of the pig have been studied after irradiation with single and fractionated doses (30 fractions/39 days) of X rays and the results compared with previously published data for the epidermis. In the follicular epithelium there was an initial degenerative phase, during which the rate of cell depletion was independent of the radiation dose and the mode of administration. Evidence for repopulation was seen between the 14th and 18th days after single doses (15 or 20 Gy) and by the 28th day after the start of irradiation with fractionated doses (52.3-80.0 Gy). However, the degree of cell depletion and the subsequent rate of repopulation were independent of dose. The regenerative phase was characterized by an increased cell proliferation as indicated by an elevation of the labelling index. Islands of cells (colonies), with an appearance similar to cells in the normal follicular epithelium, were seen 18 days after a single dose of 20 Gy and 42 days after the start of fractionated irradiation. When compared with the epidermis, the follicular epithelium exhibited considerably less evidence of damage after both single and fractionated doses of X rays. There was a lower incidence of degenerate cells and reduced levels of cell depletion in the follicular epithelium, suggesting that cells from this region play an important role in the repopulation of the epidermis after high-dose irradiation.\r"

To evaluate the relation between the dose distribution and the local treatment results, the analysis was based on a volume-dose relationship. The functions introduced by this discriminant analysis were linear, and the parameters used were modal dose, average dose and shape factors of histograms. Each group of treatment results had a correction rate of greater than 80%, except for the successfully cured group with ulcers. The discriminant functions were useful as an index to obtain a final clinical treatment result at the early time of implantation, and these functions could be used as a criterion for the optimal treatment of tongue carcinoma. We were also able to recognize the limitation of the actual arrangement of sources in the single-plane implant.\r"

Sixty-six patients subsequently underwent laparotomy, 27 undergoing hepatic resection. Forty-two patients had metastases from colo-rectal primaries, 19 hepatocellular carcinoma and 19 a variety of other tumours. The type and frequency of the abnormalities shown on venography were noted for each tumour category and for their hepatic segmental distribution. The results of venography were compared with those of arteriography, computed tomography and ultrasound and with the findings at laparotomy. Displacement was the commonest abnormality seen while encasement or obstruction occurred less frequently and tumour invasion was rare. The sensitivity of venography in correctly identifying the segmental distribution of tumour deposits was 41%. Sensitivity was poorest with tumours in the left lobe (31%) and bilobar tumours (0%). Venography was most sensitive in detecting tumour involvement of the major segmental hepatic veins and inferior vena cava (100%). Peripheral colo-rectal metastases frequently produced no venographic abnormality. Hepatic venography provides no additional information to arteriography, computed tomography or ultrasound in patients with peripheral or bilobar tumour deposits. Some additional information may be obtained with central tumours and venography is the most accurate means of detecting tumour involvement of the major segmental hepatic veins.\r"

A combination of intracavitary radiotherapy, using the Newcastle manual afterloading technique, and external-beam radiotherapy was used. The actuarial 4-year survival for all Stage 1 cervical carcinomas was 84.9%. For Stage 2 cancers the actuarial local control rate was 71.1% and the survival 49.2% and for Stage 3 cancers the 4-year actuarial local control rate was 24.3% and the survival 14.8%. Complications of treatment were confined to the bowel and bladder and occurred in 11.5% of cases. The results of treatment of Stage 1 cancer suggest that the intracavitary technique gives a satisfactory distribution of radiation. The results of treatment of more advanced cases are disappointing and suggest that improvements are possible for some patients (i.e. wedge malalignment patients). There is sufficient flexibility in the technique for it to be applied satisfactorily for most anatomical situations.\r"

The beds in various services were reallocated, and more beds were given to the medical service. Surgeons agreed to perform more surgery on an outpatient basis, and the Short-Stay and Ambulatory Procedures units were expanded to handle more procedures. In addition, the implementation of a physician-managed admission system ensured the appropriate admission of patients.

The most common reason for presentation was a request for contraceptive advice (the reason for 59.2% of the patients). Of the 446 patients (82.4%) who were sexually active 66 (14.7%) had evidence of chlamydial infection; none of the 93 sexually inactive patients were infected. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from eight (1.5%) of the patients. The risk factors that correlated with chlamydial infection were abnormal vaginal discharge, abdominopelvic pain and an abnormal Papanicolaou test result. Because of the high morbidity rate associated with genital chlamydial infection and the high prevalence rate among adolescent girls, most of whom are asymptomatic, all sexually active teenagers should be screened.\r"

The requirements to report unfit drivers vary among the provinces, and the interpretations of the law vary among the courts; therefore, physicians' risks of liability are unclear. Physicians may be sued by their patients if they fail to counsel the patients on the dangers of driving associated with certain medications or medical conditions. Physicians may also face legal action by victims of motor vehicle accidents caused by their patients if the court decides that the physicians could have foreseen the danger of their patients' continuing to drive. Physicians' legal responsibilities to report patients with certain medical conditions override their ethical responsibilities to keep patients' medical histories confidential.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac pacing is often considered in patients with recurrent syncope after repeated attempts to document the cause have failed. To assess the results of this tactic we reviewed the records of 104 patients who had received pacemakers for known or suspected bradycardia between September 1973 and March 1985. The patients were classified retrospectively into three groups: group 1 (31 patients with a mean age of 73 years) had unequivocal documentation of bradycardia during syncope, group 2 (42 patients with a mean age of 71 years) had electrocardiographic or electrophysiologic evidence of potential bradycardia but no documentation during spontaneous syncope, and group 3 (31 patients with a mean age of 69 years) had a history \"suggestive of\" bradycardia-related syncope but no other evidence to support the diagnosis. The rates of recurrence of syncope during follow-up were 6.3%, 7.3% and 32.2% in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (p less than 0.01). In group 3 recurrence was more probable in patients with loss of consciousness for more than 2 minutes than in those who were unconscious for 2 minutes or less (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that pacemaker implantation is justified for recurrent syncope after extensive attempts to document a spell have failed if abnormal diagnostic test results suggest bradycardia as a possible cause. Empirical pacing is less satisfactory in patients with normal results of evaluation but may arguably be justified when patients have recurrent syncope with injury.\r"

The mean birth weight of the IHPS group was 3501 g and of the control group 3543 g. The male:female ratio for the IHPS group was 5.5. The odds ratio of male predominance was 4. We found that bottle-feeding was 2.9 times more prevalent among the infants with IHPS than among the control subjects. We speculate that the recently observed decrease in the incidence of IHPS is due to the decline in bottle-feeding.\r"

Half of the patients had one or more of the following signs: lipemia retinalis, eruptive xanthomas, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly; the plasma triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher (greater than 40 mmol/L) among these patients than among those without clinical signs (mean 21.7 [standard deviation 13.5] mmol/L). The prevalence rate of this disorder was 30 times higher than the previously published rate and was highest in the counties of Charlevoix and Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean (200 and 100 cases per million respectively) because of the distinct demographic history of these areas. Because of a founder effect an autosomal recessive gene involved in lipoprotein-lipase expression or activation has probably been disseminated among this isolated French Canadian population.\r"

Relative survival rates of screening-detected GC patients were 69-70% and almost constant after 5 years from operation/diagnosis. The survival curve in which only death from GC was counted as a death was almost equal to the relative survival curve in its shape and value. The hazard rates of screening detected GC patients decreased rapidly within 7 years and remained low after 7 years. It was confirmed by this long-term follow-up study that about two thirds of GC patients detected by screening were successfully cured of their disease.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-nine patients with mammographically detected foci of duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of histologically confirmed extents of 25 mm or less, were treated by tylectomy without irradiation or axillary dissection. Adequacy of excision was confirmed histologically, by radiographic-pathologic correlation and by postoperative mammographic examination. Eight patients (10.1%) have recurred locally in the immediate vicinity of the biopsy site. Four patients developed recurrent in situ disease identified mammographically, and all were initially treated by reexcision. One of these patients subsequently elected to undergo mastectomy; no residual in situ or invasive disease was detected in the breast or in axillary lymph nodes. Four patients developed recurrent invasive disease; 50% of these recurrences were detected mammographically. All patients were treated by mastectomy with node dissection. Three had confirmed minimal invasive carcinomas and were N0, one patient had a 13-mm invasive lobular carcinoma with a single Group I micrometastasis. All patients, including those treated for a recurrence, are presently free of disease but three patients died of heart disease. Nuclear grade would appear to identify subsets of DCIS more likely to produce local failure after tylectomy alone. Duct carcinoma in situ with high-grade nuclear morphology and comedo-type necrosis was associated with a 19% local recurrence rate after an average interval of 26 months; only one of ten patients with intermediate-grade DCIS developed a local recurrence at 87 months; and none of 33 patients with DCIS of micropapillary/nonnecrotic cribriform type and low-grade nuclear morphology developed local recurrence in the follow-up period.\r"

In nine subjects some evidence of fixed obstruction was seen in spirometry. In three subjects pulmonary diffusion capacity was abnormal. Spirometry commonly showed a restrictive pattern of findings. The incidence of abnormalities in pulmonary function was highest among the patients diagnosed before age 3 years.

All patients had sequential cytopunctures for both cytologic examination and flow cytometric DNA analysis (FCM): one before treatment and the three others after each cycle of CT. At cytologic examination, 20 carcinomas showed CT-induced cytomorphologic changes. These changes in malignant cells were also evaluated on histologic sections after surgery. A significant relationship was found between cytomorphologic changes in cytopunctures and in the corresponding tumor tissue. The lobular carcinomas did not reveal changes either on cytologic or on histologic study. At FCM analysis before treatment, ten carcinomas were diploid and 25 were nondiploid. When initial tumor ploidy was compared to cytomorphologic changes, none of the diploid carcinomas showed changes. An objective tumor regression was observed in 12 of 20 tumors with cytomorphologic changes and in four of 15 tumors without changes on cytologic examination. But, a significant relationship appeared only when cellular changes were evaluated on histologic analysis. When tumor regression was compared to ploidy before treatment, the rate of objective regression was significantly higher in nondiploid tumors (15/25) than in diploid tumors (one of ten). From these findings, initial tumor diploidy could be a predictor of tumor chemoresistance, whereas cytomorphologic changes during chemotherapy could be an indicator of tumor cell chemosensitivity.\r"

Limited disease (LD) patients, achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after the three initial courses, received radiotherapy (RT) to the pretreatment primary tumor volume and, those achieving CR, additional RT to the brain. During RT, chemotherapy was administered with 50% dose reduction. Forty-three patients were evaluable for therapeutic response. In the 19 patients with LD, CR was achieved in 63% of patients and the PR rate was 32%. In 24 patients with extensive disease (ED), CR was 34% and PR rate was 54%. Median duration of survival was 66 weeks for LD and 48 weeks for ED. Six patients were disease-free after 2 years.

  ".W": "Using murine transplantable transitional cell carcinoma (MBT2), the effect of ethylchlorformate (ECF) polymerized tumor protein was compared with that of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Seventy-five C3H/He mice were challenged with an intradermal inoculation of 5 X 10(5) viable MBT2 tumor cells and divided into five groups. Each group was intradermally administered with 0.01 mg of ECF (low ECF), 0.25 mg of ECF (high ECF), 0.1 mg of ECF and 10(6) CFU BCG (ECF/BCG), 10(6) CFU of BCG alone or normal saline (control) weekly for 10 weeks. The mean survival rate for the treatment groups was 64 to 73 days and significantly longer than that for the control group (P less than 0.001, Savage). The incidence of biologically active tumor progression was significantly less for the treatment groups (low ECF, 53%; high ECF, 33%; ECF/BCG, 7%; BCG, 27%) compared with the control group (87%; P less than 0.5, chi-square. The mean rate of tumor growth was significantly lower for all treatment groups than for the control group (P less than 0.001, ANOVA and SNK), and the ECF/BCG group had the lowest growth rate despite a higher incidence of local granulomatous reaction. In this study, immunotherapy significantly prolonged the survival rate, decreased the incidence of biologically active tumor progression, and slowed the rate of tumor growth. The combination of ECF polymerized tumor protein and BCG had the greatest effect, suggesting that the effect of the vaccine was increased with BCG.\r"

  ".W": "The authors established five cell lines from a human head and neck tumor. The five cell lines (HC-2, HC-3, HC-4, HC-7, and HC-9) exhibited different sensitivities to Adriamycin, cisplatin, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine, and daunomycin. The D50 was 200 ng/ml Adriamycin (doxorubicin) for HC-7 and 45 ng/ml for HC-2. At the inception of long-term culture (11 months) in the absence of any drug, the sensitivity to Adriamycin of HC-7-5 (subcloned from HC-7) was 3.4 times greater than that of HC-2-6 (subcloned from HC-2); by 11 months, it decreased to 1.6 times that of HC-2-6. The cytocidal action of Adriamycin on HC-2-6 and HC-7-5 was potentiated when Adriamycin was combined with verapamil or cepharanthine. Cepharanthine also potentiated daunomycin and vincristine (VCR) against HC-2-6 and HC-7-5 cells, and it almost completely overcame drug-resistance to daunomycin and vincristine in HC-7-5/VCR, a multidrug-resistant variant isolated after long exposure to vincristine of HC-7-5 cells in culture. The cellular accumulation of [3H]-daunomycin by HC-7-5 cells was about 70% that of HC-2-6 cells. By Northern blot analysis, using a multidrug-resistance gene (mdr-1) probe, neither HC-2-6 nor HC-7-5 expressed the mdr-1 gene, but HC-7-5/VCR or other multidrug-resistant variants showed active expression of the mdr-1 gene. Differential sensitivities among the five cell lines to 5-fluorouracil, cisplatinum, and bleomycin appear to be mediated through other mechanism beside the mdr-1 gene.\r"

  ".W": "Malignant tumors induce anorexia and decrease spontaneous food intake and weight loss. Whether these effects are in part due to the tumor's physical size was investigated by inducing a benign cystic tumor mass with carrageenan in rats and then studying them for 21 days. Forty-two control rats were given subcutaneous injection of 3 ml of normal saline. Fifty-six study rats were given 3 ml of a 1.5% carrageenan solution subcutaneously, both in the right flank. Daily spontaneous food intake, body weight, and tumor weight were measured. Eight study and six control rats were randomly sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21. Blood was obtained by cardiac puncture for albumin determination, and the tumor, carcass, liver, and spleen were removed and weighed. Tumor and tissue samples were histologically examined. All rats injected with carrageenan developed a benign cystic tumor mass. Early cystic wall consisted mainly of foamy macrophages with a light lymphoplasmacytic chronic inflammatory infiltrate and moderate vascularization. At day 21, cystic wall was more compact. The vasculature had collapsed and there were more pronounced fibroblastic response and collagen bundles. Average tumor weight by day 21 was 41 g. Average spontaneous food intake was depressed by about 15% from day 8 on in study rats as compared to controls. A significant decrease in carcass weight of 15.2% was observed in study as compared to control rats at day 21. Serum albumin was significantly decreased in study rats after day 5. Liver weight was significantly lower and spleen weight higher in study rats as compared to controls. These data suggest that some characteristics associated with cancer anorexia can be found in the absence of malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effectiveness of fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lymph node in the management of young patients with peripheral lymphadenopathy, all patients 30 years of age and under who had a lymph node aspirate and who then had subsequent excisional biopsy, autopsy, or clinical follow-up for a minimum of one year were examined. One hundred twenty-seven aspirates from one hundred twenty-six patients fulfilled the criteria of the study. Diagnoses of eighty-three benign and thirty-seven malignant lymphadenopathies were confirmed. There were three false negative and four false positive diagnoses. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 0.93, 0.95, 0.90, and 0.97%, respectively. Of the one hundred twenty-six patients, twenty-five had a previous history of malignancy. Results of aspiration biopsy in this group were examined to determine FNA ability to predict recurrent disease. In this group the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 0.95, 0.80, 0.95, and 0.80 respectively. Finally, the group of patients with clinically suspicious primary lymphadenopathy without an antecedent history of malignancy were examined to determine the effectiveness of the technique for selecting patients for surgical biopsy. This group included a total of one hundred two patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 0.93, 0.96, 0.90, and 0.97, respectively. Based on the data from this retrospective study, we conclude that fine needle aspiration provides a useful tool in the management of young patients with peripheral lymphadenopathy, both in monitoring recurrent disease and in triaging patients with clinically suspicious primary lymphadenopathy to determined the next appropriate step in management.\r"

Clinical data were obtained in 71 cases. Tissue from 46 cases was studied by single cell scanning cytophotometric analysis. Two thirds of the tumors were located in the major salivary glands, the parotid being the most common site, one third occurred in the minor salivary glands. The age range was from 6 to 81 years; peaks were observed in the fourth and seventh decades; the sex distribution was almost equal. By means of a single cell scanning cytophotometric device, a division into \"diploid\" and \"atypical\" patterns was possible. The clinical course was well correlated with these two groups, the atypical group showing generally an unfavorable course. Especially in poorly differentiated tumors, selection of clinically aggressive tumors was possible by their atypical DNA distribution pattern. Consequently, single cell DNA assessment can be a useful supplementary tool in the clinicopathologic and prognostic evaluation of mucoepidermoid tumors of the salivary glands.\r"

From 72 patients who underwent subsequent surgical excision of their nodules, inadequate or discrepant FNA diagnoses were noticed in 20 cases (27.8%). These errors could be attributed to inadequate material for diagnosis (n = 6), sampling errors (n = 2), and cytodiagnostic errors (n = 12). If the diagnosis of follicular neoplasm was treated as indeterminate for malignancy, the overall efficiency of FNA was 88.9%. All false-negative diagnoses were related to procedure (i.e., inadequate smears or missed sampling of the lesion). The frequency of inadequate smears, in turn, was strongly related to the type of physician performing the aspiration. The frequency was highest among community-based clinicians (32.4%) and lowest among hospital-based cytopathologists (6.4%). With adequate sampling, the finding of 100% sensitivity in the diagnosis of malignant neoplasms by FNA cytology reaffirms its role as the procedure of choice in the initial screening of thyroid nodules.\r"

In the normal group, the Cu/Zn ratio was significantly lower (1.43 +/- 0.29). Patients with advanced disease (Stage III) had higher Cu/Zn ratio than patients in Stages I and II (2.65 +/- 0.86 versus 1.9 +/- 0.27) (P less than 0.001). At a cutoff value of 1.72, Cu/Zn ratio had a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 84%, positive predictive value of 78%, and negative predictive value of 92% between controls and lung cancer patients. Between lung cancer patients and patients with benign pulmonary lesions the aforementioned values were 89%, 70%, 90%, and 70% respectively. A correlation between increasing Cu/Zn ratio and tumor extension and postoperative survival was observed. These findings suggest that Cu/Zn ratio may be used as a diagnostic test in lung cancer patients.\r"

Forty-seven percent of the cancers (26 of 55) were detected by mammography, 18% (ten of 55) were incidental to benign disease, and 35% (19 of 55) were palpable or exhibited nipple abnormality. Incidental tumors were all DCIS, averaged seven ducts, and showed no residual tumor during mastectomy. Mammographic lesions averaged 117 ducts (31% [eight of 26] were DCISM and 42% [11 of 26] were multicentric). Most comedocarcinomas that showed a high incidence of microinvasion were in this group. Clinical lesions averaged 110 ducts (42% [eight of 19] were DCISM and 68% [13 of 19] were multicentric). Three had nodal metastases. Mammographic and clinical tumors in the quantitative range of the incidental group (50 ducts) showed significant differences from it for all variables studied. Histologic and quantitative study of these tumors is necessary to best guide treatment. Incidental tumors, however, may only need observation.\r"

The prognostic importance of 13 factors were analyzed in 112 patients with only hepatic metastases, who were eligible for hepatic artery infusional chemotherapy. When individually analyzed, six factors were found to significantly (less than 0.001) affect survival: the percentage of tumor involvement of the liver, assessed medically or surgically; initial serum albumin and lactic dehydrogenase; initial Karnofsky performance status; and weight loss. Patients with less than or equal to 30% liver involvement had a median survival of 24 months versus 10 months if they had greater than 30% involvement. There was a highly significant agreement between medical and surgical assessment of liver involvement (P = 0.0001). When the variables affecting survival were studied together by multivariable analyses, the most important factor was the medical assessment of liver involvement accomplished by evaluation of radionuclide liver scan and CTT scans. The next two most important factors in the model were the ability of the patient to obtain a tumor response and the presence or absence of weight loss. Only one factor helped predict response to chemotherapy, the type of perfusion seen on a 99Technetium-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) arterial flow scan. Forty-five percent of patients with good perfusion had a partial response while 13% of patients with poor perfusion had a tumor response (P = 0.006). We recommend that future studies, dealing with patients who have hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma and are eligible for hepatic arterial infusion, document and stratify for the following factors: the percentage of liver involvement, the presence or absence of weight loss, and the type of perfusion seen on MAA scans.\r"

Statistical evaluation was based on stepwise discriminant analysis of multiple quantitative descriptors. A data base was generated by analyzing histologic slides from eight normal (control), and 13 malignant ovarian tissues. Confirmation of the diagnosis was achieved in each case. The histologic criteria for ovarian dysplasia differ from those used for ovarian borderline malignancy. Interactive morphometric image analysis offers an objective method for delineating cancer precursors that could be used in ovarian biopsies taken by laparoscopy or during incidental abdominal surgery. It could be applied to cancer precursors in other locations.\r"

Changes in the esophageal epithelium were histologically divided into four groups: hyperplastic (34 cases), atrophic (26 cases), hyperplastic and atrophic (mixed, 20 cases), and no change (13 cases) types. The hyperplastic type was closely related with the expanding mode of invasion and depth of the invasion was less than seen with the atrophic type (P less than 0.05). The rate was significantly higher in cases of a curative resection and the outcome was better than seen with the other types (P less than 0.01-0.001). The atrophic type was related with Borrmann type IV of the gross type and infiltrative mode of invasion, and had a significantly longer length of esophageal invasion than did the hyperplastic and the no change types (P less than 0.01). The prognosis was significantly poorer than seen with the hyperplastic (P less than 0.001) or the mixed types (P less than 0.01). Our study shows that histopathologic changes in the esophageal epithelium provide the surgeon with useful prognostic indicators in cases of an adenocarcinoma in the upper third of the stomach and involving the lower esophagus.\r"

Management of these tumors, however, is of particular concern because of their aggressive behavior and the functional impairment which may result from local treatment. From 1976 to 1987 we have treated seventeen infants and children with tumors of the chest wall. Askin's tumors and Ewing's sarcoma were considered as a single entity, malignant small round cell tumor (MSRCT), and account for the majority (11 of the 17 patients). Other tumors represented were infantile fibrosarcoma (1), undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas (2), osteogenic sarcoma (1), large cell lymphoma (1), and synovial sarcoma (1). Nine of 17 patients have survived (median follow-up of survivors 5 years); six patients died of disease and two from complications of therapy. All four patients with MSRCT and metastasis at diagnosis died of disease despite chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Four of the seven patients with localized MSRCT, who received combined modality therapy including resection (two after initial chemotherapy), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, were continuously disease-free 16 months to 10 years following diagnosis. One of the three patients who failed died of complications of surgery to her extensive primary. A second patient had a relapse of disease in a hilar node four years after finishing vincristine, actinomycin, and cytoxan (VAC) chemotherapy; she was retreated with Adriamycin (doxorubicin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio), vincristine, and cyclophosphamide as well as radiotherapy to her hilum and remains in second remission 56 months following her recurrence. The third patient suffered a distant relapse in bone and, before succumbing to his MSRCT, developed acute monocytic leukemia and died during a remission induction attempt. Mixed results were obtained for the patients with other tumor types.\r"

In two cases, the gastric cancer, which was recognized at 17 and 29 months, respectively, after the nonsurgical treatment of the esophageal tumor, was treated by surgical resection. In three cases, the tumors which were diagnosed simultaneously, were treated by surgery (one case) resection of the gastric tumor and nonsurgical therapy for the esophageal tumor (one case), and nonsurgical therapy for both tumors (one case). In one case, a gastric cancer was resected 6 years before diagnosis of an esophageal tumor and a second cancer in the gastric stump. A nonsurgical protocol was then adopted for both tumors. The association of these two cancers raises questions concerning their epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and management. There is room for nonsurgical multimodality protocols and, in association with surgery, survival was prolonged for more than 1 year in five of six patients.\r"

Fifteen primary tumors (40.5%) were homogeneously diploid/peridiploid whereas 22 (59.5%) were aneuploid. In the lymph node metastasis, seven patients (29.2%) had an homogeneous diploid/peridiploid pattern in all metastatic lymph nodes. On the other hand, 17 (70.8%) had at least one aneuploid peak in the lymph node metastasis. DNA content heterogeneity was seen in 12 (33%) of primary tumors whereas 14 (66.6%) of 21 patients had multiple cell clones in the metastasis. Therefore, 12 patients had a metastatic clone which was not observed in the primary tumor. DNA content heterogeneity was seen even in tumors with submucosal invasion suggesting that this phenomenon is also present at earlier stages. No correlation between the histologic grade and the DNA distribution was observed. Furthermore, histologic heterogeneity was independent of DNA content heterogeneity. The EGF receptor expression was observed in six of the 23 patients in whom this analysis was done. The EGF receptor expression was constant in all samples which were studied and even samples with a different DNA content and histologic grade were stables for the EGF receptor expression.\r"

Overall, one patient achieved complete remission (3%), and three (10%) had a hematologic improvement with normalization of the marrow and peripheral blood picture except for persistent thrombocytopenia. Six patients (19%) demonstrated prolonged myelosuppression, three (23%) on schedule 1 and three (17%) on schedule 2. Cardiovascular complications were minimal consisting of hypotension in one patient (3%) and supraventricular arrhythmias in two patients (6%). Hyperglycemia was observed in 42% of patients and was significant in 10%. The authors conclude that homoharringtonine, at the dose schedule investigated, has definite but low antileukemic efficacy. The low-dose continuous infusion schedule was associated with prolonged myelosuppression but no serious cardiovascular complications. The role of such therapy in myeloproliferative disorders, especially chronic myelogenous leukemia, deserves consideration.\r"

Fourteen patients received 20 courses of CMF administered on a continuous infusion schedule for 14 days of a 28-day cycle. The dose rates were fixed for 5-FU (300 mg/M2/day) and methotrexate (0.75 mg/M2/day). The cyclophosphamide dose was escalated from 25 to 50, 75, and 100 mg/M2/d. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in two of five patients receiving the maximal dose of cyclophosphamide. No other toxicities were observed including alopecia, stomatitis or liver function abnormalities. This Phase I trial suggests that the cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU are comparable to the maximum doses delivered as single agent infusions. Furthermore, when the infusion CMF is compared to the \"standard\" bolus schedule for CMF, the infusion schedule delivers 116%, 8%, and 350% of the respective three component drugs (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU).\r"

The Phase I trial design developed for admixture combinations was employed with starting doses for 5-FU at 250 mg/m2/day and for FUdR at 0.075 mg/kg/day. Twenty patients and 28 courses were studied. Dose rate limiting toxicity was pseudoregional enteritis with or without stomatitis experienced by five of ten of the courses administered at the highest dose rates of the admixture components. The simultaneous delivery of the two agents results in a modest compromise of the cumulative dose delivered for FUdR. Previous Phase I studies of single agent 5-FU and FUdR had demonstrated that the optimal dose rates for the individual agents in a 14-day continuous 24-hour infusion schedule is 350 mg/m2/d and 0.125 mg/Kg/day, respectively. The maximum dose rate of 5-FU at 350 mg/m2/day for 14 days is not restricted even with the addition of FUdR at up to 0.1 mg/kg/day. The optimal dose rates for Phase II trails should be as follows: 5-FU, 350 mg/m2/day; and FUdR, 0.1 mg/kg/day.\r"

The sensitivity of CEA for predicting disease recurrence was low; however, any abnormal CEA at the conclusion of chemotherapy and during followup significantly correlated with reduced disease-free and overall survival. A CEA value greater than or equal to 20 ng/ml at the end of chemotherapy or during followup was highly specific and a strongly positive predictor for the presence of metastases. Abnormal CEA values before chemotherapy that became normal at the conclusion of chemotherapy were associated with a significantly reduced recurrence rate. An abnormal CEA value obtained before or after adjuvant chemotherapy is clinically useful and can provide prognostic information.\r"

The therapy was well tolerated. Six patients achieved satisfactory local tumor control and were able to receive the surgical procedure to permit limb salvage. Two of these six patients subsequently developed metastatic disease. Of the two patients who did not achieve satisfactory local tumor control to permit a limb salvage procedure, both underwent amputation and one later developed metastatic disease. Five patients have remained continuously free of disease for a median of 18 months (range, 12-21 months).

Plasma cells from patients with MM have previously been found to express the immunophenotype of normal plasma cells. In contrast, none of the four cases reported here express an immunologic profile typical for specific B-cell differentiation stages. Only one of four cases was strongly positive for PCA but additionally expressed B1 Ag and SIg. Of the remaining three cases, all expressed T10 Ag and CIg; two cases also expressed SIg, weak PCA, and B1 Ag. All four cases were monoclonal for lambda light chains and negative for common ALL Ag (CALLA). The variable expression of mature B-cell markers and plasma cell markers demonstrates the immunophenotypic spectrum of PCL; the prognostic significance of this heterogeneity needs to be more closely examined.\r"

Most of the porokeratotic skin lesions, with or without DNA polyploidization, increase cell proportions in the S and G2/M phase range. DNA indices of cells from these porokeratotic lesions distributed widely from the level of normal control epidermis to that of malignant epidermal conditions.

When given separately, vitamin C or K3 had a growth inhibiting action only at high concentrations (5.10(3) mumol/1 and 10(5) nmol/l, respectively). Combined administration of both vitamins demonstrated a synergistic inhibition of cell growth at 10 to 50 times lower concentrations. At this level separately given vitamins are not toxic. The sensitivity to this treatment was somewhat different in the three cell lines, being slightly higher for KB line. This tumor cell growth inhibitory effect was completely suppressed by the addition of catalase to the culture medium containing vitamins C and K3, suggesting an excessive production of hydrogen peroxide as being implied in mechanisms responsible for the above-mentioned effects.\r"

The authors also found higher concentration of sialic acid in malignant ascites than in nonmalignant ascites (P less than 0.001) and, taking 300 mg/l as the cutoff value, the false-positive rate was 10% (four of 40), the false-negative rate 30% (eight of 27), and the overall diagnostic accuracy 82%, comparable to that of the fibronectin. The authors conclude that both fibronectin and sialic acid determinations in ascites may be regarded as accurate markers of neoplastic involvement of the peritoneum, although no test is useful in the ascites with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis of the liver.\r"

Homologous mixed mesodermal tumors were the most frequent (41%) followed by leiomyosarcoma (26%), heterologous mixed mesodermal tumor (18.3%), stromal sarcoma (12%), and endolymphatic stromal myosis (3%). The peritoneal cavity and omentum were the most frequently involved sites (59%), followed by the lung (52%), pelvic lymph nodes (41%), paraaortic lymph nodes (38%), and liver parenchyma (34%). The presence of lung metastasis was not associated with pelvic or paraaortic node metastasis or intraperitoneal disease. Metastasis to other distant sites including the brain, heart, kidney, and bone were independent of pelvic and paraaortic nodal metastasis or intraperitoneal disease. Metastatic sites were not different among various histologic types. Distant metastatic sites were statistically associated with lung metastasis. Hematogenous metastasis best explains this metastatic pattern and adjuvant systemic therapy seems indicated.\r"

  ".W": "The authors describe the results of multimodality therapy in 27 patients with biopsy-proven primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma treated between 1976 and 1986. Treatment included surgical resection (15 patients), radiotherapy (27 patients), and chemotherapy (nine patients). Actuarial survival rates for the 27 patients at 1, 2, and 5 years after diagnosis were 70%, 54%, and 45%, respectively. Nine patients were recurrence-free at 8 to 106 months follow-up. A multivariate risk analysis identified five factors which had a favorable impact on survival: (1) age less than 60 years (P less than 0.02); (2) preoperative Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 70 (P less than 0.02); (3) presence of strictly hemispheric tumor (P less than 0.0003); (4) whole-brain radiation dose between 4000 and 5000 cGy (P less than 0.05); and (5) addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy (P less than 0.002). Patients with complete tumor resolution on computed tomography 6 months after beginning treatment also had longer survival (P less than 0.01). The presence of malignant cells on cerebrospinal fluid cytologic examination correlated with an increased risk of distant metastasis (P less than 0.05). In those patients whose disease eventually recurred, the administration of an additional therapeutic modality significantly increased the length of postrecurrence survival (P less than 0.05). Although surgical resection provided no increase in survival, the addition of chemotherapy to postoperative cranial irradiation significantly enhanced the duration of survival. Our experience suggests that pretreatment clinical and diagnostic factors can help in predicting survival and in planning treatment.\r"

Follow-up information was obtained on 3303 women with a median duration of follow-up of 17 years. This sample contained 84% of the patients originally selected for follow-up. The relative risk (RR) of developing breast cancer was 0.98 for women who took exogenous estrogens as compared to 1.8 for women who did not. Exogenous estrogens lowered the observed breast cancer risk in women with atypical hyperplasia (RR = 3.0 versus 4.5), proliferative disease without atypia (RR = 0.92 versus 1.9), and in women without proliferative disease (RR = 0.69 versus 0.91). Women who took estrogens before 1956 were at 2.3 times the risk of other estrogen users, presumably due to a dose effect. There was no significant association between breast cancer risk and birth control pills, cigarette smoking, or alcohol consumption. Exogenous estrogens are not associated with increased breast cancer risk in women with benign breast disease. A previous history of benign breast disease does not contraindicate replacement estrogen therapy.\r"

To date the authors have treated 70 patients and the value of this method was assessed prospectively in 14 patients. Quality of life was measured before, during, and after treatment. The quality of life (QL) index, a physician's assessment and a linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) were used. A close correlation was found between the two assessment methods (r = 0.79). Overall there was a significant improvement from the mean pretreatment score and the best score achieved posttreatment (QL: P = 0.002; LASA: P = 0.002). Patients with diarrhea, rectal bleeding, mucus discharge, or pain secondary to tumor bulk, will benefit most from this treatment. Malignant cachexia, pain secondary to sacral plexus involvement, tumor encroachment on the anal canal and/or sphincter dysfunction resulting from tumor invasion should be viewed as relative contraindications to laser therapy. The authors conclude that in selected patients endoscopic laser therapy can provide effective palliation in patients with malignant tumors of the rectum and descending colon.\r"

The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program provides information on disease stage, surgery, histologic type, and survival time to compare and contrast women in all age groups. Women who present initially with distant disease are more likely to be elderly. Certain surgical procedures are used less frequently for older women. No unusual age variations in histologic features are noted. Elderly women do as well as younger patients in survival time for localized and regional stages of breast cancer; for distant disease, they fare worse. Results emphasize the need to focus on elderly women for screening, early detection, diagnostic evaluation, and therapy.\r"

The authors tested this hypothesis by determining the effect of adjustment for SES on the black/white incidence ratios for 12 cancer sites. Race-specific census tract-level SES variables (median family income, percent below poverty level, and years of education) were obtained from the 1980 US census and applied to approximately 20,000 black and 88,000 white cancer cases from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for the years 1978 to 1982. For each cancer site (with each sex considered separately), Poisson regression was used to produce age-adjusted black/white incidence ratios, with and without adjustment for SES. The SES variable with the strongest adjusting power was percent below poverty level. For many sites (breast, in situ and invasive cervix, esophagus, male lung, pancreas, stomach) poverty accounted for much or all of the racial differences. For several sites (bladder, multiple myeloma, prostate, uterine corpus), large racial differences persisted after adjustment for poverty, and these findings suggest directions for investigating the etiology of these cancers.\r"

Home care parents reported significantly stronger relationships with spouse and remaining children, firmer religious convictions, more adequate coping abilities, and less residual guilt than non-home care parents. On the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), non-home care parents exhibited more frequent indications of maladjustment including somatization, depression, and interpersonal problems. The results confirm that the more optimal adjustment of home care parents which was first reported 5 years earlier has been maintained. Support and expansion of pediatric home hospice programs are strongly encouraged in light of the positive results of our longitudinal studies.\r"

At operation, extensive laceration of the septal mitral leaflet was found; chordae tendinae were intact. Retrospective examination of the cineangiogram revealed the presence of balloon indentation at the chordal level during inflation, which disappeared at full inflation. Mitral valve rupture was probably related to balloon entrapment in chordae tendinae, severe chordal stretching at inflation, and subsequent valve laceration. This severe complication or aortic valvuloplasty in adults has not been reported previously and probably could be avoided by careful observation of guidewire and balloon position before inflation.\r"

For example, while unconsciousness produced by general anaesthesia in a wide variety of species is reversed by compression, anaesthetic-induced inhibition of synaptic transmission is potentiated by application of pressure. To date, the effect of pressure on analgesia has not been evaluated. In this study, hyperbaric pressure of 75 ata did not antagonize analgesia which had been produced by exposure of mice to 1.2 ata of nitrous oxide. However, the same hyperbaric pressure restored righting in animals which had been anesthetized with 1.5 ata of nitrous oxide. These data add to the suggestion that the multiple effects of general anaesthetics may be mediated at different loci.\r"

The haemodynamic responses following clamping, during the clamp time and following clamp release were studied in 18 patients undergoing AAA resection and 12 patients undergoing bypass grafting for AOD. The role of preoperative aortography in predicting cardiovascular performance during aortic vascular surgery was assessed. During the cross-clamp period LVSWI and CI decreased while SVR increased in the AAA group while the AOD group showed an improved CI, stable LVSWI and reduced SVR, which correlated with the extent of periaortic vascularisation on preoperative aortography. Chronic collateral circulation associated with AOD may permit continuous lower extremity perfusion during aortic cross-clamp. The extent of periaortic collateralisation may influence the choice of monitoring techniques and anaesthetic management.\r"

The majority of studies have used blind gastric tube aspiration of stomach contents as the method of measuring the volume of gastric contents. This study evaluated the accuracy of this method by first measuring gastric content volume using blind gastric aspiration and then aspirating residual content in the stomach, using a visually guided flexible fiberoptic gastroscope. Ten obese patients undergoing elective surgery were studied. Gastric contents were collected using a multi-orificed gastric tube and blind aspiration. Immediately after this was completed, residual gastric volume was collected using a visually guided gastroscope. The sum of these two aspirate volumes (true total gastric volume) was statistically compared with the blind aspirate volume. The blind aspirate volume underestimated true total gastric volume by an average of 14.7 ml and was significantly different from true total gastric volume (p less than 0.05). Blind gastric aspiration was thus demonstrated only to approximate true gastric volume. Its use to measure precisely gastric volume cannot, therefore, be recommended.\r"

Six hours postoperatively, he developed what was initially diagnosed as an MH crisis, for which he received intravenous dantrolene. The resultant muscle weakness prolonged the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation and likely contributed to the development of a postoperative pneumonia. Plasma dantrolene levels were measured for the first 48 hours postoperatively and correlated with clinical findings. On reviewing the patient's perioperative course, it was felt that the hypermetabolic state was not due to MH. The patient's pattern of rewarming following hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass was similar to non-MH-susceptible patients. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing a MH crisis after hypothermic bypass, it is recommended that patients receive prophylactic dantrolene preoperatively and after bypass. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants should be given postoperatively to prevent shivering and respiratory acidosis while patients rewarm.\r"

In 12 patients (control group) the rectal temperature (Tre) was 33.8 +/- 1.7 degrees C (mean +/- sd) at termination of CPB. In sixteen patients (ECR group) rewarming during CPB was continued to a Tre of 36.8 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Postoperative body temperatures, heat content, shivering, oxygen uptake, CO2 production and haemodynamic variables were measured. ECR reduced the heat gain required to complete core rewarming to 665 +/- 260 kJ, compared with 1037 +/- 374 kJ in the control group (p less than 0.01). The incidence of shivering was reduced (p less than 0.05) as well as shivering intensity and duration. In seven non-shivering ECR group patients this coincided with significantly reduced metabolic and ventilatory demands but these improvements were not valid for the group as a whole. The required ventilation temporarily during postoperative rewarming in both groups increased to 250 per cent of the basal need. Extending CPB rewarming (to at least 36 degrees C Tre) was inefficient when used as the sole measure to reduce the untoward effects of residual hypothermia during recovery after cardiac surgery with hypothermic CPB.\r"

Thirty-eight (70%) out of the deceased 54 heterozygous patients died of coronary heart disease. The mean age at death was significantly less in male heterozygotes (54 years) than in female heterozygotes (69 years). Five homozygous and 105 male and 56 female heterozygous patients received coronary angiographic evaluation. The regression equations between age (X) and coronary stenosis index (Y) obtained by assigning score (0 to 5) to each of 15 coronary artery segments were Y = 1.57X - 20.43 (r = 0.956, p less than 0.05) in the homozygotes, Y = 0.52X - 9.11 (r = 0.438, p less than 0.001) in the male heterozygotes, and Y = 0.47X - 12.54 (r = 0.343, p less than 0.01) in the female heterozygotes. From these data, we can assume that coronary artery stenosis detectable by angiography will occur after 17 and 25 years of age in male and female heterozygotes, respectively, and the treatment of heterozygotes with lipid-lowering drugs can be delayed until late adolescence.\r"

In this study, myocardial contrast echocardiography was used to characterize changes in the transmural myocardial blood flow distribution that were provoked by rapid atrial pacing in 11 patients with one-vessel coronary artery disease. Ten patients without coronary artery disease served as controls. Myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed by intracoronary injection of 2 ml hand-agitated amidotrizoate sodium meglumine (Urografin-76) and by imaging a short-axis view of the left ventricle with two-dimensional echocardiography before and during injection of the contrast agent. The two-dimensional echocardiographic images at end diastole, before and after injection of the contrast agent, were digitized off-line into a 512 x 512 pixel matrix with 256 gray levels/pixel to quantify the degree of the enhancement of the peak gray level after injection. Transmural myocardial blood flow distribution was evaluated by measuring the ratio of the enhanced gray level in the endocardial half (endo) to that in the epicardial half (epi) (endo:epi gray level ratio) in the anteroseptal, posterolateral, and inferior segments before and just after rapid atrial pacing in each patient. In patients without coronary artery disease, there were no differences in the endo:epi gray level ratio between any of the three segments both before and after pacing. Mean values of the three segments were 0.95 +/- 0.08 before pacing and 0.90 +/- 0.13 after pacing, respectively. In contrast, in patients with coronary artery disease, the endo:epi gray level ratio for the segment supplied with stenotic coronary artery decreased after pacing (0.40 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.93 +/- 0.18, p less than 0.01), probably reflecting subendocardial myocardial ischemia, whereas that for the segment supplied with nonstenotic coronary artery remained unchanged (0.88 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.23, NS). Thus, changes in transmural myocardial blood flow distribution with rapid pacing, which may be due to transient subendocardial ischemia, are visualized with myocardial contrast echocardiography.\r"

At our institution, BBR has been the underlying mechanism of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in approximately 6% of patients, whereas mechanisms unrelated to BBR were the cause in the rest. Data gathered from 20 consecutive patients showed electrophysiologic characteristics that suggest this possibility. These include induction of sustained monomorphic tachycardia with typical left or right bundle branch block morphology or both and atrioventricular dissociation or ventriculoatrial block. On intracardiac electrograms, all previously published criteria for BBR were fulfilled, and in addition, whenever there was a change in the cycle length of tachycardia, the His to His cycle length variation produced similar changes in ventricular activation during subsequent complexes with no relation to the preceding ventricular activation cycles. Compared with patients with ventricular tachycardia due to mechanisms unrelated to BBR, patients with BBR had frequent combination of nonspecific intraventricular conduction defects and prolonged HV intervals (100% vs. 11%, p less than 0.001). When this combination was associated with a tachycardia showing a left bundle branch block pattern, BBR accounted for the majority compared with mechanisms unrelated to BBR (73% vs. 27%, p less than 0.01). The above finding in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy should raise the suspicion of sustained BBR because dilated cardiomyopathy was observed in 95% of the patients with BBR. Twelve of the 20 patients were treated with antiarrhythmic agents, and the other eight were managed by selective catheter ablation of the right bundle branch with electrical energy. Our data suggest that sustained BBR is not an uncommon mechanism of tachycardia; it can be induced readily in the laboratory and is amendable to catheter ablation by the very nature of its circuit. The clinical and electrophysiologic features outlined in this study should enable one to correctly diagnose this important arrhythmia.\r"

The atrial diastolic threshold was similar at cycle lengths of 600 and 450 msec, but the threshold at 300 msec was significantly higher than that determined at 600 and 450 msec both before and after procainamide. Procainamide significantly increased the diastolic threshold only at a cycle length of 300 msec. The strength-interval relation was nonlinear, showing progressively decreasing decrements in the measured refractory period as the stimulating current was increased. Progressive decreases in the drive cycle length from 600 to 450 to 300 msec caused similar decreases in refractory periods. The shape of the curves was similar at cycle lengths of 600 and 450 msex. However, at low current strengths, the slope of the curve determined at 300 msex was significantly more vertical than the slopes of the curves at the longer drive cycle lengths. Procainamide caused similar increases in apparent refractory periods at each paced cycle length. Procainamide did not alter the shape of the curves at any paced cycle length. These observations confirm the importance of stimulation frequency on atrial excitability. They suggest that the effects of procainamide on the effective refractory period of the atrium are not cycle length dependent, although the drug effects on threshold are dependent on the drive cycle length.\r"

Pathologic studies and epicardial echocardiography have shown that diffuse atherosclerosis is often present despite angiographic evidence of discrete coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, we postulated that acetylcholine would cause vasoconstriction of coronary arteries that are angiographically normal in patients with CAD. Coronary artery diameter, measured by automated quantification of digitized cineangiograms, was determined before and after the intracoronary infusion of 0.2 mM acetylcholine at 0.8-1.6 ml/min. The diameter of stenotic or irregular segments of six atherosclerotic coronary arteries decreased from 1.80 +/- 0.42 mm before acetylcholine to 1.26 +/- 0.46 mm after acetylcholine (p = 0.0025). Acetylcholine had a significantly different effect on the diameter of two groups of coronary arteries that are angiographically normal. Acetylcholine caused a 0.16 +/- 0.09-mm increase in the diameter of 14 normal coronary arteries in patients without CAD, whereas it caused a 0.26 +/- 0.12-mm decrease in the diameter of 14 normal coronary arteries in patients with CAD (p less than 0.01). Thus, the normal response to intracoronary acetylcholine is vasodilation, suggesting that endothelium-derived relaxing factor is released from normal human coronary endothelium. The vasoconstrictive effect of acetylcholine in the angiographically normal coronary arteries of patients with CAD suggests the presence of a diffuse abnormality of endothelial function.\r"

These include lack of considering patients with resting ischemia beyond day 5 of hospitalization, management of patients with reduced ventricular function or patients not exercise tested, and the role of coronary angiography in the elderly. Based on this experience and further analysis in 1,848 patients surviving beyond day 5 of hospitalization, a modified decision scheme for coronary angiography was developed and then tested in a second population (n = 780). In the new scheme, patients over 75 years of age are considered individually. Those under 75 years of age with severe resting ischemia in the hospital at any time beyond the first 24 hours (18% mortality between day 6 and year 1), and hospital survivors with a history of previous myocardial infarction and clinical or radiographic signs of left ventricular failure in the hospital (25% 1-year mortality after discharge), are recommended for coronary angiography. Among the remaining patients, some will perform an exercise test, and those with an ischemic response or poor workload (11% 1-year mortality) are also assigned to coronary angiography. When an exercise test is not performed, a resting radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction is recommended, and coronary angiography is considered if the value lies between 0.20 and 0.44 (12% 1-year mortality). This relatively simple scheme does not make general recommendations in the elderly, considers patients with in-hospital left ventricular failure or reduced left ventricular function or both, and approaches the problem of patients who do not perform an exercise test. This general approach would avoid early coronary angiography in patients with an average 1-year mortality risk after discharge of 3% and recommend coronary angiography in those at increased risk (average mortality rate, 16%) who make up about 55% of this population under 75 years of age.\r"

This cohort was initially examined from 1957 to 1960, reexamined from 1962 to 1964, and followed until 1977 or death. LTPA was ascertained by a precursor of the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire. The risk estimate for coronary heart disease death, after adjusting for age, was 1.39 for sedentary men who expended 40 kcal/wk in LTPA compared with very active men who expended 3,632 kcal/wk. This relation was attenuated by adjusting for other coronary heart disease risk factors, but it remained independent and significant. Caloric expenditure in light and moderate activity, as well as that performed in any intense activity, showed independent relations to cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. Associations were slightly stronger in occupationally sedentary men. These results support the hypothesis that physical activity protects against death from coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality.\r"

  ".W": "To improve the diagnostic usefulness of electrocardiography (ECG) in determining the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with body surface mapping, 87 unipolar ECGs were recorded from 57 patients with left ventricular (LV) concentric hypertrophy and 30 with LV dilatation. Body surface ECG features due to LVH were evaluated by increase of QRS voltage and delayed local activation. We measured for each lead R voltage, net area of QRS (AQRS), ventricular activation time (VAT), and departure index (DI) of AQRS and VAT (DI = mean/SD). From these measurements, seven parameters were calculated for each patient: Rmax, the maximal R wave voltage; AQRSmax, the maximal AQRS; AQRS-Dmax, the maximal AQRS DI; AQRS-Darea, the area size where DIs of AQRS are more than 2; VATmax, the maximal VAT; VAT-Dmax, the maximal VAT DI; and VAT-Darea, the area size where DIs of VAT are more than 2. Among these parameters, the most effective for diagnosis of LVH were selected by stepwise multiple regression analysis. In the concentric hypertrophy group, the combination of VAT-Darea and Rmax was determined to be the best for estimating wall thickness. The regression equation determined from them correlated well to wall thickness (r = 0.73). In the LV dilatation hypertrophy group, only AQRSmax was selected for estimating LV dilatation. A good correlation between AQRSmax and LV internal dimension was observed (r = 0.73). With the body surface distribution of VAT prolongation, septal hypertrophy was separated from the other LVH. These were superior to the conventional method of 12-lead ECGs. ECG diagnosis of LVH severity improved by incorporating a mapping study. Also, prolongation of VAT and increase in QRS voltage were shown to be important when determining the severity of LVH.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated that exercise training can induce important hemodynamic and metabolic adaptations in patients with chronic heart failure due to severe left ventricular dysfunction. This study examines the accompanying changes in submaximal exercise performance and the ventilatory response to exercise in these patients. Before and after 16-24 weeks of exercise training, subjects underwent two symptom-limited bicycle exercise tests, one with an incremental graded workload, and one with a constant workload that represented 79 +/- 11% of the pretraining peak oxygen consumption. Breath-by-breath expired gas analysis was performed continuously during each test, and central hemodynamic, leg blood flow, and blood lactate measurements were obtained during the incremental protocol. The ventilatory anaerobic threshold was determined during the incremental exercise study from coplotted breath-by-breath ventilatory data with standard criteria by observers who were unaware of patient identity or training status. As previously reported, exercise training increased peak oxygen consumption by 23% from 16.8 +/- 3.8 to 20.6 +/- 4.7 ml/kg/min and reduced blood lactate levels during submaximal exercise. The training-induced decrease in lactate accumulation was accompanied by a decrease in carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange ratio, and ventilation during submaximal exercise. The ventilatory anaerobic threshold was delayed from 284 +/- 43 to 352 +/- 91 seconds of exercise (p = 0.02), and it occurred at an increased oxygen consumption (10.1 +/- 1.2 vs. 12.1 +/- 2.6 ml/kg/min, p = 0.01). Exercise duration during the constant workload protocol increased from 938 +/- 410 to 1,429 +/- 691 seconds (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Examination of the 15 replaced prostheses revealed a torn or perforated leaflet in 12 valves and a sewing ring dehiscence in one valve. Additional restricted leaflet motion (classified as mild obstruction) was seen in three of these 13 valves. In the remaining two valves, severe prosthesis obstruction was noted. Changes in the Doppler indexes between the preoperative and postoperative study were present in all patients regarding Vmax (mean, 2.2 +/- 0.3 versus 1.6 +/- 0.2 m/sec; p less than 0.001), mean gradient (mean, 9 +/- 5 versus 5 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; p less than 0.001), and isovolumic relaxation time (mean, 47 +/- 12 msec versus 80 +/- 13 msec; p less than 0.001). The mean mitral valve area remained virtually unchanged (2.3 +/- 0.9 versus 2.6 +/- 0.3 cm2; p = NS) but increased postoperatively in each patient with preoperative mild or severe prosthesis obstruction without concomitant aortic regurgitation. Our conclusion is that the peak mitral flow velocity, the mean gradient, and the isovolumic relaxation time are useful parameters in the differentiation of normal and abnormal mitral prosthesis function but may not define the underlying lesion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may be enhanced in systemic hypertension. The hypothesis took origin from the following two considerations: alveolar hypoxia constricts the pulmonary vessels by enhancing the Ca2+ penetration across sarcolemma of the smooth muscle cells and systemic high blood pressure is associated with an elevation of tone and reactivity of the lung vessels, which seems to depend on an excessive cytosol free Ca2+ concentration due to alterations in sodium handling and in the Na+-Ca2+ exchange system. These considerations suggest the possibility that the disorders in the biochemistry of smooth muscle contraction in hypertension facilitate the rise of cytosol Ca2+ concentration during alveolar hypoxia, thus resulting in a potentiation of the vasoconstrictor properties of this stimulus. In 43 hypertensive and 17 normotensive men, pulmonary arteriolar resistance has been evaluated during air respiration and after 15 minutes of breathing 17%, 15%, and 12% oxygen in nitrogen. Curves relating changes in pulmonary arteriolar resistance to oxygen breathing contents had similar configuration in the two populations but in hypertension were steeper and significantly shifted to the left, reflecting a lower threshold and an enhanced reactivity. This pattern was not related to differences in severity of the hypoxic stimulus, plasma catecholamine concentration, or hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis induced by hypoxia and probably was not mediated through alpha-receptor activation. Calcium channel blockade with nifedipine was able to almost abolish both the normotensive and the hypertensive pulmonary vasoconstriction reaction. These findings support the hypothesis that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction may be enhanced in systemic hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty healthy adults served as controls. The patients with constrictive pericarditis showed marked changes in left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time and in early mitral and tricuspid flow velocities at the onset of inspiration and expiration. These changes disappeared after pericardiectomy and were not seen in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy or in normal subjects. The deceleration time of early mitral and tricuspid flow velocity was shorter than normal in both groups, indicating an early cessation of ventricular filling, but only patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy showed a further shortening of the tricuspid deceleration time with inspiration. Diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation was also more common in the patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. These results suggest that patients with constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy can be differentiated by comparing respiratory changes in transvalvular flow velocities. In addition, although baseline hemodynamics in the two groups were similar, characteristic changes were seen with respiration that suggest differentiation of these disease states may also be possible from hemodynamic data.\r"

  ".W": "Impaired left ventricular relaxation and filling is an important pathophysiologic mechanism in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To determine whether isoproterenol, known to improve relaxation in isolated cardiac muscle, could favorably modify this effect, we assessed simultaneous left ventricular volume and regional systolic asynchrony (by radionuclide angiography), left ventricular pressure (by micromanometer catheters), and lactate metabolism in 12 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Pressure-volume relations were studied during atrial pacing stress to induce myocardial ischemia and during isoproterenol infusion to similar heart rates. Angina occurred in 10 patients with pacing and in 11 patients during isoproterenol infusion; lactate consumption was reduced in nine patients during isoproterenol compared with pacing, including five patients who produced lactate with isoproterenol. During isoproterenol compared with pacing, peak left ventricular pressure was higher (205 +/- 33 vs. 142 +/- 21 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), ejection fraction was higher (77 +/- 10% vs. 71 +/- 12%, p less than 0.02), and regional systolic nonuniformity was diminished. Despite ischemia, these changes in load and nonuniformity during isoproterenol were associated with enhanced diastolic function compared with pacing tachycardia: isoproterenol reduced T 1/2, the half-time of pressure decline after peak negative dP/dt (from 46 +/- 10 to 33 +/- 6 msec, p less than 0.001), shifted the diastolic pressure-volume curve downward and rightward in 10 of 12 patients, and increased end-diastolic volume (from 77 +/- 18% to 100 +/- 11% of control values, p less than 0.001) with no change in end-diastolic pressure (19 +/- 7 to 19 +/- 5 mm Hg, p = NS). Thus, despite ischemia, isoproterenol improved left ventricular relaxation and filling compared with tachycardia in the absence of beta-adrenergic stimulation. Although isoproterenol is detrimental in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by provoking ischemia, these data suggest that the adverse effects of ischemia on ventricular relaxation and distensibility may be alleviated by beta-adrenergic stimulation, possibly as a result of enhanced inactivation and restored load sensitivity.\r"

The biodistribution of 125I-antimyosin demonstrated that the highest ratio of radioactivity appears in the heart of infected mice on day 14 (the ratio of percent dose per gram for the organ to percent dose per milliliter for blood; 9.75 +/- 2.79 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.78 at 24 hours in inoculated mice vs. control mice). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean activity ratios of tissues other than the heart in control and inoculated mice. The uptake ratio for the heart increased significantly 3 days after virus inoculation and reached a maximum on day 14 when myocardial lesions were most extensive and prominent. The uptake ratio decreased significantly, but it still remained high compared with controls on day 28 when cellular infiltration had decreased and fibrosis was evident. The scintigraphic images obtained with 131I-antimyosin monoclonal antibody clearly demonstrated that visualization of the heart in experimental myocarditis was possible 24 hours after administration of radiotracer, and localized activity was still observed in the 48-hour image. We conclude that antimyosin monoclonal antibodies localize selectively in the heart from the acute to subacute stage of viral myocarditis. These findings indicate that antimyosin scintigraphy is a reliable noninvasive method for the evaluation of patients suspected of having myocarditis.\r"

This type of atrial flutter is due to circus movement of an impulse around the tricuspid valve orifice. We recorded simultaneously from 96 bipolar intracavity electrodes in the right atrium of the isolated, perfused heart. By constructing isochronal maps, we demonstrated the pattern of atrial activation during atrial pacing protocols that either entrained or entrained and then terminated the reentrant rhythm. We show that during pacing the antidromic wavefront from the paced impulse (An) collides with the orthodromic wavefront from the previous paced impulse (On-1). During entrainment, the site of collision of the orthodromic and antidromic wavefronts was constant during pacing at a fixed rate but shifted in the antidromic direction as the pacing rate increased. Furthermore, the last paced beat was entrained only up to the site of collision of the previous paced beat. During one period of entrainment, termination of the reentrant arrhythmia occurred because On-1 blocked in the reentrant pathway due to refractory tissue left by On-2. However, subsequent An did not collide directly with On as was expected, but rather On blocked by an interaction with tissue left refractory by An. Because On was blocked, no reentry occurred when pacing ended.\r"

  ".W": "The well-known paradoxic behavior of atrioventricular conduction, the so-called gap phenomenon, that occurs when impulses within a certain range of coupling intervals are blocked while impulses with shorter coupling intervals are conducted is attributed to differences in properties of refractoriness in neighboring regions of the conduction system. In contrast, in the present study a model was developed showing a similar phenomenon, dependent on different electrophysiologic mechanisms and localized within the atrioventricular node in an isolated rabbit heart tissue preparation (n = 11). The hearts were paced at cycle length of 400-500 msec, and atrioventricular nodal conduction times (A2H2) were measured versus atrial extrastimulus (A1A2) coupling intervals by standard extrastimulus techniques. Postganglionic vagal stimulation was applied in the atrioventricular node as short bursts of subthreshold (for myocardium) stimuli with duration of 50-150 msec, amplitude of 20-800 microA, and absolute phase (delay after A1) of 0-500 msec. Vagal bursts with appropriate parameters consistently produced bimodal conduction curves. Initially, gradual shortening of the A1A2 coupling interval was associated with an increasing A2H2, with an accentuated increase (or even atrioventricular block) within an intermediate A1A2 range. However, further shortening of the A1A2 coupling interval produced a decrease in A2H2, which subsequently was followed by a block at the effective refractory period. Microelectrode recordings indicated that this characteristic bimodal pattern of conduction curves, demonstrating a gap, reflected transient vagally induced hyperpolarization in the N region of the node. In those instances where conduction block occurred and gap was manifest, the most marked hyperpolarization coincided with the time of arrival of midcycle premature extrastimuli, whereas the conduction of extrastimuli with either more or less prematurity was under less-marked vagal influence. Thus, this study demonstrates a new electrophysiologic mechanism producing anomalous conduction curves and the gap phenomenon within the atrioventricular node based on vagal-induced nonuniform recovery of diastolic excitability.\r"

Dogs had been previously instrumented with a left ventricular pressure micromanometer and ultrasonic crystals for measurements of major, anteroposterior, and septum-free wall diameters. Left ventricular volume was calculated with an ellipsoidal model in the left ventricular cavity. ESPVRs obtained during caval occlusion after volume loading were curvilinear as shown by the division of the relation into two parts. The initial part of the relation had a significantly smaller ESPVR slope (Ees, 12.0 +/- 1.8 mm Hg/ml) and ESPVR volume-axis intercept (Vd, - 3.5 +/- 0.8 ml) than the final part of the relation (19.5 +/- 3.1 mm Hg/ml and 0.0 +/- 0.6 ml, respectively, p less than 0.01). The end-diastolic volume-peak dP/dt relation showed a similar curvilinearity when end-diastolic volumes were larger than 1.5-1.7 times the minimal end-diastolic volume reached during caval occlusion. ESPVRs were not different during aortic constriction and caval occlusion when end-diastolic volume was small. In contrast, with large end-diastolic volumes, Ees and Vd were significantly smaller during caval occlusion than during aortic constriction. The final part of ESPVR (with small end-diastolic volume) had the same slope and intercept as that during aortic constriction. We conclude that preload produces a curvilinearity of ESPVR that significantly modifies derived indexes when the range of preload changes is large.\r"

  ".W": "As it was reported that correction of anemia in long-term hemodialysis patients by recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) is associated with improved sexual function, we conducted the present study to further delineate the mechanism(s) by which this is brought about. Serum prolactin, testosterone, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were followed during 4 months of r-HuEPO therapy. Within 4 months of treatment with r-HuEPO, hematocrit values rose from 23.7 +/- 1.2 to 35.7 +/- 0.2% and hemoglobin increased from 7.3 +/- 0.3 to 11.3 +/- 0.4 g/100 ml. In parallel, serum prolactin values decreased significantly from 66.9 +/- 9.3 to 9.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml in females and from 39.5 +/- 10.5 to 10.3 +/- 1.0 ng/ml in male dialysis patients. Testosterone concentrations were low in male patients and remained unchanged during r-HuEPO therapy. Baseline PTH values were elevated (1,880 +/- 220 pg/ml) in patients of both sexes and declined to 1,410 +/- 180 pg/ml during treatment with r-HuEPO. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Sexual function improved in 4 out of 7 males and 5 out of 9 female patients began to menstruate regularly again. It appears that treatment of anemia in end-stage renal disease by r-HuEPO improves sexual function via normalization of elevated serum prolactin concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of an HIV-related nephropathy as a distinct disease entity is controversial. We observed a high incidence of renal disease in our AIDS patients. Of 182 patients, 59 patients (32.4%) were found to have heavy proteinuria (greater than 2 g/24 h). Of these, 24 patients had slow progression of renal insufficiency and 2 patients had rapid deterioration to end stage renal disease. There was a notable absence of hypertension in these cases. The incidence of proteinuria was similar in blacks and hispanics; however 22.8% of blacks had renal insufficiency as compared to 6.9% of hispanics. There was no difference in the incidence of heavy proteinuria between intravenous drug abusers (32.3%) and nonabusers (33.3%). Renal morphology when examined showed characteristic changes, including cytomembranous structures and virus-like particles. These changes were similar in patients with heavy or light proteinuria, though they were less severe in the latter. We conclude that a HIV-related nephropathy exist and the presence of cytomembranous structures and virus-like particles in the renal tissue raises the possibility of a viral etiology for this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The short-term effect (2 weeks) of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on renal hemodynamics and urinary albumin excretion was investigated in eleven normotensive patients with incipient diabetic nephropathy (IDN). Six patients had had elevated baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and each responded to enalapril with a decline in the GFR, from a mean of 160.7 to 134 ml/min/1.73 m2, (p less than 0.05). Their respective filtration fraction values also decreased from a mean of 27.8 to 23.8% (p less than 0.01). Such renal hemodynamic change was accompanied by a decrease in urinary albumin excretion (33 to 19 micrograms/min, p less than 0.05). The remaining 5 patients had displayed normal baseline GFR (mean, 109.6 ml/min/1.73 m2), responded to enalapril with minimal change in the GFR (115.2 ml/min/1.73 m2) and showed no significant improvement in their microalbuminuria. It is concluded that enalapril is effective in lowering glomerular filtration pressure and ameliorating microalbuminuria in the normotensive patient with IDN only when the baseline GFR is elevated.\r"

CsA was given in a starting dose of 6 mg/kg and plasma through levels (RIA) were kept between 50 and 150 ng/ml. Diagnosis included: idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis (n = 6), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (n = 3), minimal change disease (n = 3) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (n = 2). Three patients with non-immunologically mediated nephrotic syndrome due to Alport's syndrome were studied as well. Considering all patients and diagnostic groups together, proteinuria decreased from 9.0 +/- 4.3 to 4.7 +/- 3.8 g/24 h during CsA treatment (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.01). However, serum creatinine increased from 121.8 +/- 60.5 to 150.4 +/- 64.6 mol/l (p less than 0.01) and glomerular filtration rate as estimated by 24-hour creatinine clearance fell from 85.5 +/- 33.7 to 72.1 +/- 37.2 ml/min (p less than 0.05). When compared to other diagnostic groups, fractional excretion of protein, i.e. protein excretion corrected for changes in glomerular filtration rate, fell only in IMGN (ANOVA, p less than 0.05). We conclude that CsA reduced proteinuria in patients with refractory nephrotic syndrome. In the majority of these patients this reduction could be due to a renal hemodynamic, rather than an immunomodulatory effect of the drug. Only in IMGN the latter action of the drug may be of importance.\r"

Substitution with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) results in long-term correction of renal anemia. We investigated the changes in cardiac function under rhEPO therapy using echocardiography. 13 patients with severe renal anemia (hct less than 26%) but independent of regular blood transfusions during the last six months were treated with 40-120 IU/kg rhEPO intravenously three times/week. Echocardiographic studies were performed in the anemic state and when hematocrit values were stable at levels above 30%. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and end-systolic diameter (LVESD) were reduced (LVEDD: 53.9 +/- 4.2 mm vs. 51.4 +/- 5.8 mm; LVESD: 35.7 +/- 5 mm vs. 32.8 +/- 5 mm). Mean end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV) were also diminished (LVEDV: 141.9 +/- 25.4 ml vs. 128.1 +/- 32.5 ml; LVESV: 54.8 +/- 18.6 ml vs. 45.1 +/- 17 ml). Stroke volume (SV) fell slightly from 87.1 ml to 83 ml resulting in a decrease of cardiac output (CO) from 6.9 +/- 1.6 l/min to 6.2 +/- 1.7 l/min. The thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall (LVPW) and of the septum interventriculare (IVS) remained constant. Myocardial contractility indicated by ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS) and the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF) frequently improved. Our data indicate that correction of renal anemia by rhEPO can improve myocardial function in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.\r"

All patients were given vitamin C (500 mg daily) for 2 years and observed for a further 2 years on no treatment. VC-S significantly increased the plasma levels of ascorbic acid up to 7.8 mg/dl (mean 3.3 +/- 0.4 s.e.m.) which fell after withdrawal to the normal range (mean 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg/dl). Hyperoxalemia was aggravated by VC-S (mean 61.5 +/- 3.3 mumol/l, range 33.3 to 165.5) while plasma oxalate levels in the unsupplemented period decreased to 36.3 +/- 3.3 mumol/l (p less than 0.01). There were no differences in creatinine, hematocrit, blood transfusion requirement, morbidity (including hospitalization) or mortality between the two periods of time in the same patients. In conclusion, we could not find any beneficial effects on morbidity or mortality as a result of using VC-S in regular HD patients. However, secondary hyperoxalemia was aggravated. As a result of these observations it appears that VC-S is harmful and unnecessary in these patients provided they are on an adequate diet.\r"

We found that the four encephalopathic cases were older than the 34 azotemic patients (68 years +/- 14 SD, vs 50 +/- 13, p less than 0.05), had a higher mean serum aluminum value (727 micrograms/l +/- 320 vs 92 +/- 73, p less than 0.005), had taken more aluminum hydroxide (5 g/day +/- 0.9 vs 1.6 +/- 1.8, p less than 0.01), and more Shohl's solution (64 ml/day +/- 19 vs 20 +/- 29, p less than 0.01). In all 38 patients the serum aluminum values correlated directly with age (p = 0.01), aluminum hydroxide (p = 0.001) and concomitant citrate intake (p = 0.004). In the five healthy volunteers the 24-hour urinary aluminum excretion increased from a baseline of 22 micrograms +/- 19 SD to 167 +/- 109 (p = 0.05) during aluminum hydroxide intake, rising to 580 +/- 267 (p = 0.01) during the simultaneous intake of citrate and aluminum hydroxide. Corresponding serum aluminum values were 11 micrograms/l +/- 2 SD, 44 +/- 34 (p = 0.1), and 98 +/- 58 (p less than 0.05). Thus citrate seems to enhance aluminum absorption and may cause encephalopathy in patients with chronic renal failure, especially the elderly.\r"

Insurance companies generally were not receptive to their inquires. The consensus of the responses was that ultimate insurability is dependent upon review of the medical record. For individual gastrointestinal diseases, responses were variable and often not easily categorized. Many companies encourage applicants previously denied coverage to reapply at a later date. Most pediatric gastrointestinal disorders are not insurable or insurable only at increased rates. Since insurability is dependent upon review of the medical record, the medical record must reflect the diagnosis and prognosis accurately. Education of the insurance industry regarding pediatric gastrointestinal disorders is encouraged.\r"

However, in cases with a positive history and a negative patch test with petrolatum, the hydrogel prepared from Methocel-E-4M seems to be a useful alternative vehicle for water-soluble allergens.\r"

Challenge patch testing using 250 p.p.m. a.i. Skane M-8 elicited allergy in 6 out of 6 sensitized individuals. Sensitized individuals did not cross react with Kathon biocide, (Kathon CG), a mixture of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one. All pretrolatum preparations to which Tween 85 was added at 2.5% produced mild irritation in cumulative insult patch tests, but no irritation was observed with Tween 85 at 0.625%. We conclude that Skane M-8, 250 p.p.m. a.i. with Tween 85 0.625% in petrolatum is appropriate for patch testing for Skane M-8 allergy.\r"

We conclude that it is possible that excessive and prolonged exposure to hypochlorite may in some cases result in irritation and damage to the skin. This potentially gives rise to altered proteins which in rare cases may cause hypersensitivity. This reaction is common to other reactive small molecules with a strong irritant action.\r"

However, the derivatives, methyl abietate and calcium abietate, were shown to be moderate sensitizers, and the maleic-modified adduct to be a moderate to strong sensitizer. As laevopimaric acid plays only a minor role in colophony, abietic acid must be considered a major, even if weak, allergen in non-modified colophony.

From July 1981 to March 1987, 216 patients were admitted to the medical ICU: 166 (77%) were admitted for procedures and 50 (23%) were admitted for life-sustaining support. Most of the patients were admitted for respiratory failure (36 of 50), primarily as a result of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Other patients were admitted for cardiovascular instability (six of 50 patients), CNS dysfunction (four patients), or other reasons (four patients). Of 50 patients admitted to the ICU, 13 (26%) were alive 3 months after hospital discharge. Despite 25 needle-stick injuries and 56 mucosal splashes involving human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and staff, no staff member converted HIV serology. These results suggest that AIDS patients may benefit from ICU admission. These patients appear to pose a low risk to the hospital staff in terms of occupationally acquired HIV infection, but strong emphasis needs to be placed on minimizing accidental exposures to potentially infected body fluids and to adhering to universal precautions.\r"

We managed eight patients with high IAP (mean 51 +/- 7 cm H2O), six of whom had hemodynamic measurements; a clinical syndrome, characterized by hemodynamic, respiratory, and renal dysfunction, then became apparent. We report a) a baseline cardiopulmonary profile and response to an acute vascular volume challenge in six patients and b) surgical decompression of the abdomen in four patients. The clinical impression of hypovolemia was confused by small to normal left ventricular end-diastolic volume (64 +/- 14 ml) and normal ejection fraction (55 +/- 6%) despite very high right and left atrial filling pressures. Complete ventilatory support was necessary to maintain oxygenation and ventilation; oliguria (urine output less than 10 ml/h) was present. Pericardial effusion was absent. After fluid challenge (10 ml/kg of colloid or crystalloid infused iv over 10 min), filling pressures, cardiac output, and stroke volume all increased significantly (p less than .025) while heart rate decreased. Surgical decompression of the abdomen improved oxygenation, ventilation, cardiac output, atrial filling pressures, and urine output within 15 min. The cardiovascular effects of massively elevated IAP compounded by the requisite supportive care may require surgical relief.\r"

Seven patients had primary neuromuscular diseases; the other 20 had primary lung diseases. All patients had stable respiratory failure, without gross malnutrition or electrolyte disorders. Their best initial T-piece duration averaged 6.4 +/- 8.4 (SD) h, with pHa 7.33 +/- 0.09 and PCO2 63 +/- 4 torr at the end of the T-piece trial. We provided a mean of five weekly training sessions of spontaneous breathing through an adjustable nonlinear resistor, with gradually increasing duration and resistance. When initial T-piece tolerance was less than 2 h, two to ten breaths of mechanical ventilation were provided during IRT sessions. No training session exceeded 30 min, and mechanical ventilation was provided between IRT sessions. Under this regimen, maximal inspiratory pressure improved from -37 +/- 15 to -46 +/- 15 cm H2O (p less than .001) and vital capacity improved from 561 +/- 325 to 901 +/- 480 ml (p less than .001). Twelve of the 27 patients were successfully weaned after 10 to 46 days; five more were weaned to nocturnal ventilation, for a total of 63%. We conclude that IRT can improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance in patients with respiratory failure, and can allow many of them to be weaned from mechanical ventilation.\r"

Our data indicate that a loading dose of gentamicin or tobramycin of 3 mg/kg ABW in patients with multiple trauma and 2.5 mg/kg ABW in patients with isolated head trauma will obtain a mean initial peak serum level of 6.6 micrograms/ml. Although adequate maintenance dosing requires individualization based on pharmacokinetic analyses, large aminoglycoside doses can be used safely in patients with blunt trauma if appropriate monitoring is employed.\r"

Right ventriculotomy decreased cardiac output from 2.47 +/- 0.43 to 1.34 +/- 0.16 L/min (p less than .01), increased CVP from 3.7 +/- 1.5 to 8.3 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (p less than .01), and decreased mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP) from 143 +/- 16 to 121 +/- 21 mm Hg (p less than .01). There was no effect on mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. After stabilization a randomized crossover controlled comparison of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) was performed. FIO2, pH, PCO2, core temperature, and preload were held constant. Mean airway pressure (Paw) was 4.8 +/- 0.7 cm H2O on CMV vs. 3.5 +/- 1.0 cm H2O on HFO (p less than .05). There was no difference in PaO2. We found no statistically significant differences between the two modes of ventilation with respect to cardiac output, MAP, MPAP, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance. Blood flows to cerebral cortex, renal cortex, adrenal, hepatic artery, left ventricular myocardium, and skeletal muscle were not different when comparing CMV to HFO. Despite the ability to attain equivalent oxygenation and ventilation at lower Paw, HFO offers no hemodynamic advantage over CMV in the presence of right ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Acute HS (mean arterial pressure 60 mm Hg X 90 min, then 40 mm Hg X 30 min) in 24 splenectomized dogs was treated with 50 ml/kg of lactated Ringer's solution (RL) plus a volume equal to 105% of shed blood volume of FDA-20 (group 1), FDA-20 carrier Annex solution (group 2), or RL (group 3). Cardiopulmonary, hemopoietic, hemodynamic, and organ function parameters were measured preshock, at the end of shock, and at 30 and 60 min, and 24 h after resuscitation. FDA-20 produced effective volume expansion, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption. The FDA-20 appeared to affect organ function and cells adversely as reflected by a fall in red cell mass and platelet levels and by a rise in liver enzymes, BUN, and serum creatinine. Both the FDA-20 and Annex solution led to a reduction in serum proteins including serum albumin, serum globulin, immunoglobulin-G, and fibrinogen. These reductions are probably due to an oncotically driven factor which appears to maintain an optimal lymph to plasma oncotic ratio. The hydroxyethyl starch in the FDA-20 and the Annex solution, thus, would drive the plasma proteins into the interstitial space. The prolonged prothrombin times and the activated partial thromboplastin times after FDA-20 may be due, in part, to a reduction in the coagulation proteins, although these were not measured. Pending further studies designed to assess the effects of FDA-20 on possible cellular and multiple organ toxicity, clinical studies are premature and unwarranted.\r"

We have designed a pigtail catheter which may be inserted into the pleural space by a modified Seldinger technique. This 8.5-Fr polyurethane catheter has six side ports inside its circular distal end. An airtight plastic bag is attached to the insertion needle to confirm pleural placement. Nineteen catheters were inserted in 16 neonates and small children with either pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. No complications were noted. All but one pneumothorax was successfully evacuated; however, the pneumomediastinum reaccumulated. Insertion proved to be safe, simple, and atraumatic. This pigtail pleural drainage catheter provides an alternative to standard tube thoracotomy.\r"

The first formula, Equation 1, assumes a constant RQ of 0.8; the second formula, Equation 2, uses the mixing equation and requires analysis of inspired, mixed expired, and end-tidal gas samples. We tested the consistency of these formulas before and after asymmetric oleic acid pulmonary edema, then calculated and compared venous admixture values using the PAO2 value derived from each formula. Before oleic acid, Equations 1 and 2 were similar (213 +/- 22 vs. 211 +/- 22 [SD] torr, respectively), as were venous admixture values (8.7 +/- 2.9% vs. 8.5 +/- 2.9%, respectively). After oleic acid injury, Equation 1 was significantly lower than Equation 2, thus slightly but consistently underestimating venous admixture (29.9 +/- 12.2% vs. 30.2 +/- 12.3%; p less than .01). However, the venous admixture values obtained after oleic acid injury calculated from Equations 1 and 2 correlated closely (r2 = .998; p less than .001), and the clinical differences yielded by the two formulas would be minimal. We recommend using the simpler formula (Eq. 1) when calculating PAO2.\r"

The IABP could significantly prevent the development of postoperative low cardiac output state, and the best survival rate (62 percent) was obtained in the coronary arterial disease group. In the VAB group, eight (44 percent) cases were weaned, and four (22 percent) cases survived. These conventional assist devices could, though with limitations, certainly support the circulation and/or provide a period for it to recover, otherwise bridging the patients to new methods. The early decision not only for initiation of mechanical assist devices but also for moving to more definite procedures will improve the results with such devices.\r"

Studies were performed at rest with routine ventilatory tests and lung scan quantitation of right-left lung function. Cycle ergometry exercise was then performed at 2 submaximal work loads (25 and 40 watts). Data were obtained using systemic and pulmonary artery catheterization for blood pressures, thermal dilution cardiac output, and blood gases. Twenty-nine patients underwent lung resection and seven failed to tolerate the procedure (death within 60 days or prolonged ventilator dependence). Those parameters most clearly separating the group tolerating surgery (n = 22) from the intolerant group (n = 7) were obtained during exercise and included: cardiac index (tolerant 5.5 +/- 1.3 vs intolerant 3.9 +/- 0.3 L/min/m2, p less than .01), O2 delivery (p less than .01) and calculated VO2 ml/kg/min (tolerant 11.3 +/- 2.1 vs intolerant 7.8 +/- 1.5 ml/kg/min, p less than .001). Pulmonary vascular pressures and calculated resistance did not predict intolerance. Calculated VO2 at 40 watts did not separate those patients who had survivable complications from those who did not (p much greater than .05). Multivariate analysis suggests that exercise VO2 is an important predictor of tolerance of lung resection because it reflects the effects of cardiac function and O2 transport. In our patients with COPD, submaximal exercise testing predicted intolerance of lung resection better than calculation using quantitative lung scanning. Exercise testing may accomplish this goal by uncovering deficits in O2 transport.\r"

If nocturnal oxygen desaturation occurred in the first half and was improved in the second half of the night, the subject entered a two-month treatment program. In random order, either nocturnal air or nocturnal oxygen was administered for one month each at 2 L/min in a double-blind crossover design. Neuropsychologic testing was done before and after each month. SETTING: Oxygen concentrators were modified to produce either greater than 96 percent oxygen or air at 2 L/min. Machines were delivered to the home of the subject and the machines were used each night, administering inspirate by nasal cannula. PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen asymptomatic men who snored heavily and volunteered for minimal payment of $75. INTERVENTIONS: Air was administered for one month, and oxygen was administered for one month. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: On the screening night, oxygen administration did not improve obstructive sleep apnea, but did improve oxygenation. After one month of oxygen therapy at night, there was no significant benefit to multiple measures of neuropsychologic function.

Systolic, mean, and diastolic ICP and AP increased during sleep above awake values. The ICP increased during NREM stages 1 to 4, and the highest values were observed during REM sleep.

Cough and discomfort during bronchoscopic examination was absent or minimal in 17 of 21 normal subjects (80 percent) and in 14 of 18 patients (77 percent) and was severe in only one instance (5 percent). There were no related complications. Using only topical and nebulized anesthesia is safe and effective for performing fiberoptic bronchoscopy, especially when bacterial cultures are to be obtained and endobronchial instillation of lidocaine must be avoided.\r"

Transbronchofiberscopic curettage was performed in 85 cases under x-ray TV fluoroscopy. Only 65 of 85 patients were positive on the initial bronchoscopy (76.5 percent), with repeated bronchoscopy, and 71 of 85 were positive for malignant cells (83.5 percent). The cases for which diagnosis could not be obtained with curettage were those in which the tumor shadow was not visible by x-ray TV fluoroscopy, those in which the lesions arose extramurally compressing the bronchi, or in cases of subpleural lesions. Curettage did not yield a diagnosis in cases with lesions less than 1.1 cm. In cases of small lung cancer lesions, peripheral transbronchofiberscopic curettage should be expected to yield a false-negative rate of approximately 15 percent. Therefore, even when the results of curettage are negative, further detailed examinations including needle biopsy, are necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis.\r"

  ".U": "89120245\r", 
  ".W": "The results of previously published studies indicate that calcium channel blockers are capable of competitively inhibiting cytochrome P-450 activity in hepatic microsomes, the pathway of theophylline metabolism. In addition, case reports have suggested that theophylline serum concentrations change when a calcium channel blocker has been added to or deleted from a stable theophylline regimen. To determine the clinical relevance of this potential interaction in patients with chronic asthma, we measured a peak steady-state theophylline serum concentration in 21 subjects while receiving theophylline alone (400 to 1,500 mg/day), and again, at least seven days later, after the addition of continuous therapy with maximally tolerated doses of either diltiazem (n = 18) or nifedipine (n = 16). The diltiazem dose was increased in 120 mg/day increments, as tolerated, to a maximum of 240 to 480 mg/day, while the nifedipine dose was increased in increments of 40 mg/day, to a maximum dose of 80 to 160 mg/day. The mean +/- SEM theophylline serum concentrations were 13.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml before and 14.0 +/- 1.2 micrograms/ml during concurrent diltiazem therapy, and 12.6 +/- 1.0 micrograms/ml before and 12.2 +/- 1.1 micrograms/ml during nifedipine (p greater than 0.05). With this sample size there is a 5 percent chance that we missed a 20 percent change in serum concentration (type II error). Thus, maximum tolerated doses of diltiazem or nifedipine do not impair the metabolism of theophylline to a clinically relevant degree and adjustment of theophylline dosage is not required after the addition or discontinuation of diltiazem or nifedipine. In addition, these data suggest that currently available in vitro techniques for evaluating drug interactions in the hepatocyte do not predict the clinical relevance of such an interaction in patients who might require both drugs for different therapeutic indications.\r"

Four allergic subjects who were known to develop only isolated immediate responses upon Kentucky bluegrass inhalation, as well as four mild allergic asthmatic subjects known to develop typical dual phase responses, were evaluated. All testing was done more than nine weeks after the grass pollen season had ended. Allergen inhalation produced an immediate response in all subjects. However, upon resolution of the immediate response to allergen in these pretreated subjects, the PC200His in all dual responding asthmatics and in three of the four isolated immediate responders had substantially increased above baseline values. We conclude that prednisone pretreatment leads to histaminic hyporeactivity soon after resolution of the immediate allergic response in both dual responding asthmatics and isolated immediate responders. It would seem that this prednisone effect is independent of its potential influence on the influx of inflammatory cells into diseased airways.\r"

The main pathologic pulmonary vascular findings consisted of plexiform lesions, thromboses, and venous lesions. Endothelial damage induced by the toxic agents is suggested as an initial causative mechanism, perpetuated by intimal proliferation and in situ thrombosis. Plexiform lesions appear late and active histologically. This new cause of pulmonary artery hypertension, with pathologic findings similar to those found in primary pulmonary hypertension, may help in understanding the pathophysiology of this unknown disease.\r"

Based on these variables, patients with abnormal scintigraphy compatible with pulmonary embolism and patients with scintigraphy not compatible with embolism were classified in accordance with the scintigraphic diagnosis. When these 16 variables were tested in an additional validation group, clinical and scintigraphic diagnosis matched in most cases. These results show that clinical data can be used to predict the outcome of lung perfusion scintigraphy in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism. Use of a standardized questionnaire can improve the accuracy of pretest assessment of such patients and positively influence the decisions to start heparin coverage or obtain pulmonary angiography.\r"

While intravascular PAP decreased during apneas and increased at the resumption of breathing, transmural PAP values (ie, corrected for intrathoracic pressure swings) showed a trend toward a progressive increase throughout apneas and toward a decrease once ventilation had been resumed. The measurement of transmural values allowed a reliable assessment of PAP changes occurring during apneas, and different degrees of such changes shown by different patients may be related to a host of factors relevant to wakefulness and sleep, including individual responsivity to hypoxic stimulus.\r"

The Quality of Well-being scale (QWB) is a widely used tool for measuring quality of life by three subscales: mobility, physical activity, and social activity, with points assigned within each subscale. The QWB has been shown to be valid in patients with COPD. We administered the QWB scale to 44 patients with CF, aged 7 to 36 years, and examined the relationship between QWB and PFTs, and in 15 patients the QWB vs exercise performance (peak VO2) on a progressive cycle ergometer test. QWB was significantly correlated with each variable examined: QWB vs FEV1, r = 0.5518 (p less than .0001); QWB vs FEF25-75%, r = 0.4793 (p less than .001); QWB vs PEFR, r = 0.4018 (p less than .01); QWB vs peak VO2, r = 0.5778 (p less than .01). The QWB scale is an objective measure that is significantly correlated with measures of performance and pulmonary function in CF. The relationship is not one of identity; further, the QWB is broad based and takes into account general well-being, not just pulmonary health, adding an important dimension to the care of patients with CF.\r"

In most of the patients, high levels of neopterin were found in the serum, BAL fluid and BAL cells. Because neopterin in BAL fluid results from local production as well as from plasma transudation, neopterin in BAL cells seems to reflect the macrophage stimulation more directly. In addition, the correlation between cellular neopterin and lymphocyte count was found to be more significant than the correlation between cellular neopterin and macrophage count. Neopterin in BAL fluid and cells may be a useful measurement in the investigation and elucidation of pulmonary pathologies involving the cellular immune system.\r"

Ten patients with the Biorate and 11 patients with the Meta were studied. In both groups, significant rate response and improvement in exercise duration compared with fixed rate ventricular pacing were achieved during symptom-limited treadmill exercise tests, with good correlations between the pacing rate and estimated oxygen consumption. Motion artefacts affected the measured impedance of both pacemakers, with rate response occurring during arm movements in the absence of respiratory activity. This observation suggested that both pacemakers have the potential of activity sensing. The earlier version of the Biorate (RDP3) was limited by myopotential interference, and erosion of the auxiliary lead can be problematic in some patients.\r"

In ten patients with MVP, chest pain, and normal coronary anatomy, the LVEF remained essentially unchanged (increase of -0.5 +/- 4 percent) after exercise. In ten patients with MVP and no chest pain and in nine with normal cardiovascular system and chest pain, the exercise LVEF increased by 11.5 +/- 2 percent (p less than 0.05) and 17.4 +/- 3 percent (p less than 0.005), respectively. The resting LVEF was significantly lower (p less than 0.02) in the symptomatic MVP patients (59 +/- 3 percent) than in the asymptomatic MVP (76 +/- 5 percent) or symptomatic normal patient control subjects (70 +/- 3 percent). Patients with MVP and chest pain had a lower resting LVEF and an abnormal left ventricular functional response to exercise compared with asymptomatic MVP patients or symptomatic normal subjects.

Two patients developed an acute myocardial infarction ten and 50 months after cardiac irradiation at the age of only 28 and 24 years, respectively. None of the patients died from lymphoma within five years from the diagnosis, but one of the infarctions was eventually fatal. Since acute myocardial infarction is rare in this age group, the result suggests strongly that prior cardiac irradiation is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction. The possibility of radiation-induced myocardial infarction should be taken into account both in treatment planning and follow-up of patients with Hodgkin's disease.\r"

On admission to the ICU, 117 patients (61 percent) had hypomagnesemia (serum Mg less than 1.5 mEq/dl), 66 patients (34 percent) had normomagnesemia (1.5 to 2.0 mEq/dl), and ten patients (5 percent) had hypermagnesemia (greater than 2.0 mEq/dl). There were no correlations between the severity of illness score (r = 0.145) or the degree of hypoproteinemia (r = 0.01) and the postoperative serum Mg level. Patients with severe hypomagnesemia (serum Mg less than or equal to 1.0 mEq/dl) experienced hypokalemia more often (p less than 0.02) than the others in the study. Furthermore, those with severe hypomagnesemia had a higher mortality rate (7/17 or 41 percent) than the remainder of the population studied (22/176 or 13 percent) (p less than 0.02). Those with severe hypomagnesemia had received aminoglycosides more often (p less than 0.001) than those with normal serum Mg concentrations. The serum Mg level was not a sensitive (68 percent) or specific (37 percent) predictor of survival. Our conclusions were as follows: (1) hypomagnesemia is common in postoperative ICU patients; and (2) patients in the postoperative ICU who have severe hypomagnesemia have a higher mortality and more hypokalemia than similarly ill patients with normomagnesemia. Because of the association between aminoglycoside therapy and severe hypomagnesemia, we recommend measurement of this variable in those patients receiving aminoglycosides. Furthermore, Mg replacement therapy is recommended for those patients with serum Mg values of 1 mEq/dl or less.\r"

Although wide interpatient variability was observed, the SvO2-time response curve produced a similar trend as the CI-time response curve. The SvO2 may be a useful drug monitoring parameter in patients with NYHA class 3 CHF. Seriously ill patients may not have a good CI/SvO2 correlation. This is most likely due to an unstable oxygen consumption rate at the tissue level.

The application of a temporary external stabilization device improved pulmonary mechanics by decreasing the respiratory rate from 36/min to 10/min while increasing tidal volume and vital capacity from 140 +/- 85 ml and 195 +/- 90 ml, respectively, to 450 +/- 110 ml and 905 +/- 310 ml, respectively. The improvement with the temporary device facilitated weaning from mechanical ventilation. We recommend consideration of this technique in selected cases of flail chest resulting from major chest wall resection.\r"

The first patient had two aneurysms, while the second had an aneurysm in continuity with a traumatic ventricular septal defect. These aneurysms were detected by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging and should be sought in patients who develop valvar regurgitation following chest trauma.\r"
