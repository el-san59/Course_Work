  ".W": "A rapid and simplified technique for detecting hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA by spot hybridisation in the sera of patients with different clinical forms of HBV infection was investigated using enzyme conjugated synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides as probes. These are able to hybridize to the S and C regions of the HBV L(-) DNA strand. When compared with a complete 32P-labelled HBV DNA probe, the synthetic oligonucleotides provided a sensitive and quick method for the routine survey of HBV infection. Moreover, the DNA extraction procedure used allowed the spot hybridisation technique to be applied and read easily and the results obtained within a few hours. It is concluded that synthetic cold probes can be used in hybridisation assays HBV DNA detection as part of current clinical laboratory procedures.\r"

Our data show that UVB plus UVA is more effective in inducing new or exacerbating preexisting skin lesions than either wavelength alone. We believe that testing with the appropriate ultraviolet light sources is a practical means to differentiate between DSAP and disseminated superficial porokeratosis.\r"

We report a clinical follow-up of 705 subjects treated with a new bovine collagen implant, Atelocollagen (Koken Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Sensitization to the implant was evaluated in all subjects by skin testing, and humoral response was monitored in 166 subjects by measuring the level of circulating antibodies directed against bovine collagen. Twenty-seven patients (3.8%) exhibited a positive response to a skin test, and of the remaining 656 patients, an adverse reaction to the implant developed in 2.3%. We found a strong correlation between the presence of antibodies to collagen and a positive response to skin testing (92%) or an adverse reaction (100%). In the case of a borderline clinical response to bovine collagen implantation, anticollagen serologic tests appeared to be a useful tool for the identification of clinically reactive patients.\r"

Vasculitis or epidermal changes suggestive of lupus erythematosus were not observed in any of the cases, although immunoglobulin or complement deposition along the basement membrane zone and focal liquefaction degeneration of the basal layer in involved skin were seen in some cases. Major dermal infiltrates consisted primarily of CD4+ and 4B4+ lymphocytes.\r"

Lingua plicata occurred in 18 (50%) patients, and peripheral facial paralysis was present in 17 (47%). Fourteen biopsy specimens were obtained, all from the orofacial region. Eight specimens revealed the classic pathologic picture of granulomatous cheilitis. No etiologic agent was identified in any of the patients.

  ".U": "90062772\r", 
  ".W": "Patients (n = 533) who participated in the Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands Trial were followed up for 3 to 7 years. The 5 year survival rate after thrombolytic therapy with intracoronary streptokinase was 81% (269 patients) compared with 71% after conventional therapy (264 patients). The greatest improvement in survival was observed in patients with anterior infarction (81% versus 64% with thrombolytic therapy or conventional therapy, respectively), in those with heart failure on admission or a previous infarction and in those with extensive myocardial ischemia on admission. Left ventricular ejection fraction at the time of hospital discharge was better after thrombolytic therapy. In the hospital survivors, long-term outcome was related to left ventricular function at the time of discharge and, to a lesser extent, to the underlying coronary artery disease. The initial therapy (thrombolysis or conventional) was not an independent additional determinant of long-term survival when left ventricular function and coronary status at the time of hospital discharge were taken into account. Thus, the salutary effects of thrombolytic therapy appear to be the result of myocardial salvage. Reinfarction within 3 years was observed more frequently after thrombolytic therapy, particularly in patients with inferior wall infarction and those with greater than or equal to 90% stenosis of the infarct-related vessel at discharge. Coronary bypass surgery and coronary angioplasty were performed more frequently after thrombolytic therapy than in conventionally treated patients. At 5 years, approximately 40% of patients in both groups had an uneventful course without reinfarction or additional revascularization procedures. These observations demonstrate that the benefits of thrombolytic therapy are maintained throughout 5 years of follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of these, 14 patients (Group 1) had an in-hospital episode of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation while wearing a 24 h Holter ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor, 33 (Group II) had a documented episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or both, and 20 (Group III) had angina pectoris but no ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Eight Group I survivors underwent programmed electrical stimulation or ECG signal averaging, or both. All Group II patients underwent 24 h Holter monitoring and ECG signal averaging to detect late potentials before programmed electrical stimulation. Group III patients underwent both 24 h Holter recording and coronary angiography. The 24 h ECG tapes were analyzed for ST segment changes, prematurity index and characteristics of ventricular premature depolarizations. Any ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm for greater than 30 s was considered to be a reflection of silent ischemia, and the induction of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation by programmed electrical stimulation or the presence of late potentials, or both, was considered to be a reflection of the arrhythmia substrate. Silent ischemia preceded ventricular tachycardia in only 2 (14%) of the 14 Group I patients. The prematurity index was less than 1 in only 18% of ventricular tachycardia episodes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "One hundred seven asymptomatic patients who underwent intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging were evaluated to determine prognostic indicators of subsequent cardiac events over an average follow-up period of 14 +/- 10 months. Univariate analysis of 18 clinical, scintigraphic and angiographic variables revealed that a reversible thallium defect, a combined fixed and reversible thallium defect, number of segmental thallium defects and extent of coronary artery disease were significant predictors of subsequent cardiac events. Of the 13 patients who died or had a nonfatal infarction, 12 had a reversible thallium defect. Stepwise logistic regression analysis selected a reversible thallium defect as the only significant predictor of cardiac events. When death or myocardial infarction was the outcome variable, a combined fixed and reversible thallium defect was the only predictor of outcome. In patients without previous myocardial infarction, the cardiac event rate was significantly greater in those with an abnormal versus normal thallium scan (55% versus 12%, p less than 0.001). Thus, intravenous dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy is a useful noninvasive test to risk stratify asymptomatic patients with coronary artery disease. A reversible thallium defect most likely indicates silent myocardial ischemia in a sizable fraction of patients in this clinical subset and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis.\r"

The 48 patients with grafts implanted for greater than 36 months (Group 2) had a 12.5% incidence rate of myocardial infarction, a 4% incidence rate of emergent bypass surgery and a 4% incidence rate of death for an overall cardiac complication rate of 14.9% (p less than 0.01). Follow-up was obtained at a mean of 16.8 +/- 13.9 months (range 1 to 54) in 87 patients (97% of successful cases). Repeat coronary angiography was performed in 49 patients and revealed restenosis in 30 patients (61.2%), with no difference in recurrence rates for proximal, mid or distal graft sites. Clinical recurrence (defined as recurrence of symptoms, myocardial infarction, repeat angioplasty, surgery or death) was 33.1% for Group 1 patients and 64.1% for Group 2 patients (p less than 0.01). The complication and recurrence rates of saphenous vein graft angiography are significantly higher when performed for late (greater than 36 months) vein graft failure.

The severity of valvular and subvalvular disease was graded echocardiographically from grade I to IV (mild to severe) for immobility, thickening, calcification of mitral leaflets and subvalvular thickening and fusion, yielding a maximal total score of 16. The diastolic mitral anulus diameter was measured in the apical four chamber view. After valvuloplasty, the mitral valve area increased from 0.9 +/- 0.3 to 2.2 +/- 0.5 cm2 (p less than 0.001) with increasing mitral regurgitation in 12 (32%) of the 38 patients. Multiple stepwise analysis revealed that the ratio of balloon size and annular size and the severity of subvalvular disease are two independent factors that correlated significantly with the mitral valve area after valvuloplasty (multiple r = 0.65, p less than 0.0002). One of 34 patients with mild subvalvular disease of grade III or less had an unsatisfactory increase in mitral valve area to less than or equal to 1.5 cm2, whereas 3 of 4 patients with severe (grade IV) subvalvular disease had a valve area less than or equal to 1.5 cm2 (p less than 0.002) after valvuloplasty. The increase in mitral regurgitation after valvuloplasty correlated significantly with the ratio of balloon to mitral anulus size and the severity of subvalvular disease (multiple r = 0.53, p less than 0.003).

However, the prognostic value of these arrhythmias in an unreferred asymptomatic community-dwelling population over a broad age range is unknown. Of 1,160 subjects aged 21 to 96 years who underwent maximal exercise treadmill testing an average of 2.4 times, 80 (6.9%) developed frequent (greater than or equal to 10% of beats in any 1 min) or repetitive (greater than or equal to 3 beats in a row) ventricular ectopic beats on at least one test. These 80 individuals were significantly older than the group without such arrhythmia (63.8 +/- 12.5 versus 50.0 +/- 16.1 years, p less than 0.0001). A striking age-related increase in the prevalence of frequent or repetitive exercise-induced ventricular ectopic beats was seen in men (p less than 0.0001) but not in women. The prevalence of electrocardiographic abnormalities at rest, exercise-induced ST segment depression and thallium perfusion defects, duration of treadmill exercise, maximal heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product did not differ between these 80 study subjects with frequent exercise-induced ventricular ectopic beats and a control group matched for age and gender. Furthermore, the incidence of cardiac events (angina pectoris, nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac syncope or cardiac death) (10% versus 12.5%) as well as noncardiac mortality (each 7.5%) was found to be similar for the study and control groups, respectively, over a mean follow-up period of 5.6 years.

The main findings of this study were: 1) Preoperative neuropsychological measures revealed a high frequency of impaired performance, particularly in measures of memory, higher level processing of information and motor speed. A pattern consistent with diffuse rather than focal or lateralized cerebral deficits was observed. Significant differences were not found on the basis of the cause of cardiac disease, but some were observed for age (the older group was more impaired). 2) A comparison of pre- and postoperative cognitive scores failed to show significant cognitive improvement despite greatly improved physical health. The cause of cardiac deterioration was not differentially associated with postoperative cognitive performance, and there was equivocal evidence for age effects. These findings may have implications for the selection of transplant recipients and the timing of transplantation surgery.\r"

Left ventricular technetium-99m isonitrile tracer uptake at rest was assessed in the three major coronary vascular territories. When qualitative rest technetium-99m isonitrile uptake was markedly reduced or absent (grade 0), there was a 91% probability of finding a totally occluded or severely stenosed coronary artery. When qualitative tracer uptake was reduced (grade 1) or normal (grade 2), it excluded all territories supplied by a totally occluded vessel with poor collateral flow. Quantitative technetium-99m isonitrile uptake (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) in territories supplied by an occluded coronary artery with poor collateral flow (42 +/- 21%) was lower than in territories supplied by a vessel with less than 50% stenosis (87 +/- 10%) and 50 to 99% stenosis (74 +/- 19%) (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, technetium-99m isonitrile uptake in areas supplied by an occluded coronary artery with good collateral flow (61 +/- 23%) was lower than in areas supplied by a vessel with less than 50% stenosis (87 +/- 10%) (p less than 0.001). Because rest technetium-99m isonitrile imaging detects coronary occlusion with poor collateral flow, this method may be useful in assessing patients with acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Rest left ventricular Tc-99m isonitrile uptake was assessed qualitatively in three coronary vascular territories as grade 0 (markedly reduced) to grade 2 (normal), and quantitatively by circumferential profile analysis. Wall motion was scored qualitatively in corresponding vascular territories as normal, hypokinetic or akinetic/dyskinetic. There was an overall relation between qualitative Tc-99m isonitrile uptake and wall motion. Abnormal wall motion occurred in 74% of vascular territories with perfusion grade 0, in 61% of those with grade 1 and in 30% of those with grade 2; however, 26% of territories with grade 0 uptake had normal wall motion. In the territories visually assigned perfusion grade 0, quantitative isonitrile uptake (mean value +/- SD) was higher when corresponding wall motion was normal or hypokinetic (62 +/- 15%) than when akinesia was detected by gated blood pool scan (39 +/- 16%, p less than 0.02). Qualitative Tc-99m isonitrile uptake improved after coronary bypass surgery in 12 of 13 territories with reduced uptake preoperatively; this included all 5 territories with a preoperative Tc-99m isonitrile score of 0.

In a pilot group consisting of 20 normal men (less than 5% likelihood of coronary artery disease) and 25 men with coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% coronary stenosis by angiography), profiles representing the lowest observed value below the mean normal profiles provided the best threshold for defining normal limits. Abnormal portions of the patient profiles were plotted on a two-dimensional polar map. The polar map was divided into 102 sectors, and sectors with a probability of greater than or equal to 80% for disease of each one of the three major coronary arteries were clustered to represent specific coronary artery territories. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for defect size showed that the optimal threshold for defining a definite perfusion defect was 12% for the left anterior descending and left circumflex and 8% for the right coronary artery territories. These criteria were prospectively applied to an additional 92 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease, 18 patients with normal coronary arteriograms and 28 patients with less than 5% likelihood of coronary disease. Sensitivity, specificity (in patients with normal coronary arteriograms) and normalcy rate (in patients with less than 5% likelihood of coronary artery disease) for overall detection of coronary disease were 96%, 56% and 86%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for identification of individual diseased vessels were, respectively, 78% and 85% for the left anterior descending, 79% and 60% for the left circumflex and 81% and 71% for the right coronary artery. These results were not significantly different from those of the pilot group. An optimized quantitative method for interpretation of stress thallium-201 myocardial perfusion tomography has been developed. Prospective application of this method indicates that the technique is accurate for the overall detection of coronary artery disease and identification of disease in individual arteries.\r"

  ".W": "In symptomatic severe aortic regurgitation, left ventricular diastolic pressure increases rapidly, often exceeding left atrial pressure in late diastole. This characteristic hemodynamic change should be reflected in the Doppler mitral inflow velocity, which is the direct result of the diastolic pressure difference between the left ventricle and left atrium. Mitral inflow velocity was obtained by pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography in 11 patients (6 men, 5 women: mean age 53 years) with severe symptomatic aortic regurgitation and compared with normal values from 11 sex- and age-matched control subjects. The following Doppler variables were determined: velocity of early filling wave (E), velocity of late filling wave due to atrial contraction (A), E to A ratio (E/A), deceleration time and pressure half-time. In severe aortic regurgitation, E and E/A (1.13 m/s and 3.3, respectively) were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than normal (0.60 m/s and 1.5, respectively). Deceleration time and pressure half-time (117 and 34 ms, respectively) were significantly shorter (p less than 0.001) than normal (203 and 59 ms, respectively). Late filling wave velocity (A) was not statistically different in the two groups, although it tended to be lower in the patient group (0.39 versus 0.50 m/s). Diastolic mitral regurgitation was present in eight patients (73%). M-mode echocardiography of the mitral valve, performed in 10 patients, showed that only 3 (30%) had premature mitral valve closure. In symptomatic severe aortic regurgitation, the Doppler mitral inflow velocity pattern is characteristic, with increased early filling wave velocity (E) and early to late filling wave ratio (E/A) and decreased deceleration time of the E wave.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging studies to assess left ventricular function have used multiple axial planes, which are compromised by partial volume effects and are time consuming to acquire and analyze. Accordingly, an imaging approach using cine NMR and planes aligned with the true cardiac axes of the left ventricle was developed in views comparable with left ventricular cineangiography. Cine NMR imaging was used to assess regional wall motion and was validated by comparison with biplane left ventricular cineangiography. Fifty-nine patients underwent cineangiographic and NMR studies within 72 h. A poor quality NMR study precluded analysis in 4. leaving a study group of 55 patients (mean age 58 +/- 12: 17 women). Cine NMR movie loops were acquired in two long-axis planes: 1) right anterior oblique plane, parallel to the septum, and 2) four chamber orthogonal plane, perpendicular to the septum (this view is comparable to the angiographic left anterior oblique view). To assess regional wall motion, the left ventricle in both cine NMR and cineangiographic images was divided into five segments and graded on a five point grading scale from 3 for normal through 0 for akinesia and -1 for dyskinesia. Regional wall thickening was used qualitatively to aid in the analysis of wall motion. For the 275 segments compared in the right anterior oblique view, agreement was within one grade in 263 (95.6%) of 275 segments, whereas absolute agreement was observed in 171 (62%) of 275 segments. In the left anterior oblique view, of 200 segments evaluated, agreement within one grade was achieved in 184 segments (92%) and agreement was complete in 132 (66%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Signal-averaged electrocardiograms (X, Y and Z leads) were acquired from 24 patients with coronary artery disease and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, 24 control patients with coronary artery disease and 23 normal subjects to assess the discriminant value of fast Fourier transformation of the entire late potential period of the QRS complex. Analysis of the vector magnitude in the temporal domain (25 to 250 Hz bandpass filters) measured high frequency QRS duration, the duration of terminal signals less than 40 microV and the root mean square voltage of the last 40 ms. Late potentials were defined as terminal signals greater than 25 Hz that were less than 40 microV. Analysis in the frequency domain used a 120 ms window that encompassed (had onset with) all of the late potential, but the mean value was first subtracted to eliminate a direct current component. High frequency spectral areas (60 to 120 Hz) and the percent high frequency (100 x [60 to 120 Hz/0 to 120 Hz]) were calculated. Results in both temporal and frequency domains were similar in control patients with coronary artery disease and normal subjects. Patients with ventricular tachycardia had a longer high frequency QRS complex (p less than 0.0001) and longer high frequency terminal signals less than 40 microV (p less than 0.0004), but not significantly lower voltage in the last 40 ms. The most useful temporal domain measurement was high frequency QRS duration (if greater than or equal to 120 ms, odds ratio = 8.2). Patients with ventricular tachycardia had increased high frequency spectral areas (p less than 0.0002) in the late potential, and the percent high frequency was especially increased (p = 0.0000; if percent high frequency greater than 3.1%, odds ratio = 18.4). The odds ratio and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were both greater for percent high frequency than for high frequency QRS duration (p less than 0.03). All patients with ventricular tachycardia had a high frequency QRS complex greater than or equal to 107 ms or percent high frequency greater than or equal to 3.1% (sensitivity 100%). For a high frequency QRS complex greater than or equal to 107 ms and percent high frequency greater than or equal to 3.1%, specificity was 96%. Therefore, high frequencies in late potentials, not their duration or reduced voltage, most usefully identify patients with coronary artery disease who are prone to ventricular tachycardia.\r"

All patients had underlying coronary artery disease. Patients underwent programmed cardiac stimulation in random order during a baseline period and with nitroprusside infusion. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 20 +/- 8 mm Hg at baseline study to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg during nitroprusside infusion (p less than 0.0001). Pulmonary artery, right atrial and systemic arterial pressures also decreased with nitroprusside (p less than 0.01). Cardiac output did not change. Left ventricular dimensions, determined by two-dimensional echocardiography, decreased significantly during nitroprusside infusion. The right ventricular effective refractory period, measured during ventricular drive trains at cycle lengths of 400 and 600 ms, were similar during baseline and nitroprusside periods (271 +/- 30 versus 274 +/- 31 ms at 600 ms, and 249 +/- 25 versus 246 +/- 18 ms at 400 ms). In 2 patients no ventricular arrhythmias were induced during either study period; in the other 10, ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced during both periods. The mean number of extrastimuli required to induce a ventricular tachyarrhythmia was similar during the baseline period (1.8 +/- 0.6) and during nitroprusside infusion (1.9 +/- 0.7). As well, the mean cycle length of ventricular tachycardia induced was similar during the baseline period (347 +/- 61 ms) and during nitroprusside infusion (342 +/- 70 ms).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to determine whether right ventricular pre-ejection interval, measured in patients by a prototype pacemaker system capable of tracking intraventricular volume, changes predictably with exercise and, if so, whether it can be used in an algorithm to vary heart rate appropriately. This system utilizes intraventricular electrical impedance measurements of injected microampere currents to determine intracavitary volume changes. Five pacemaker-dependent patients underwent temporary insertion of a tripolar electrode connected to an external device that sensed cardiac signals, generated an impedance wave form and produced stimuli at rates dependent on pre-ejection interval. Pre-ejection interval did not change as a result of variations in pacing rate itself (347 +/- 41 ms at 70 beats/min versus 321 +/- 19 ms at 130 beats/min), but consistently decreased during graded exercise (by 23% from baseline). During rate-modulated pacing based on pre-ejection interval, heart rate significantly increased during exercise compared with ventricular demand pacing (by 46 +/- 6 versus 7 +/- 6 beats/min, respectively), and increased appropriately during burst exercise. Thus, the pre-ejection interval appears to be a specific, reliable physiologic determinant of pacing rate during exertion, which may be applicable in implantable rate-modulated pacemakers.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen adult patients with atrial tachycardia refractory to treatment with a mean of four drugs underwent attempted surgical cure. Atrial tachycardia originated in the right atrium in 17 patients and the left atrium in 1 patient. Tachycardia could be reproducibly induced and terminated by atrial extrastimuli or atrial pacing in 8 patients (44%). Resection of the arrhythmogenic area was performed in 16 patients (89%), and an isolation procedure was performed in 1 patient. In seven cases (39%), the area of isolation or excision included the sinoatrial node. One patient underwent His bundle section because the arrhythmogenic region was too close to the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system to enable resection. The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 56 +/- 34 months. Clinical tachycardia recurred in five patients (28%), but in two patients it did not recur until greater than 1 year after surgery. A permanent pacemaker was implanted in 3 (18%) of the 17 patients whose His-Purkinje system was left intact. One other patient had required permanent pacing before surgery. Only one of the seven patients undergoing sinoatrial node resection or isolation required permanent pacing for symptomatic bradycardia. Apart from the requirement for permanent pacing, no significant complications occurred. Surgical therapy for atrial tachycardia is a safe procedure, but the rate of cure appears to be less than that of supraventricular tachycardias associated with accessory AV connections. Excision or isolation of the sinoatrial node does not necessitate permanent pacing in most patients.\r"

  ".W": "The myocardial uptake of a new technetium-99m-labeled myocardial perfusion agent, methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (Tc-99m MIBI), and thallium-201 was correlated with microsphere flow in an open chest canine model of low coronary flow and postischemic dysfunction. Eighteen dogs were given an injection of thallium-201 (0.5 mCi) and Tc-99m MIBI (5 mCi) either after 40 min of partial left anterior descending artery occlusion (Group I, 10 dogs) or during reperfusion after 15 min of left anterior descending artery occlusion (Group II, 8 dogs). Regional dysfunction was documented during injection in both groups by quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography. Regional blood flow was assessed by radiolabeled microspheres. The heart was excised 15 min after radionuclide injection and the left ventricle divided into 96 segments for gamma well counting. Among Group I dogs, central ischemic thallium-201 and Tc-99m MIBI activity (expressed as a percent of the activity in the corresponding nonischemic zone) was comparable, respectively, for endocardial (54 +/- 17% and 52 +/- 17%), mid-wall (71 +/- 20% and 69 +/- 17%) and epicardial (89 +/- 13% and 94 +/- 9%) segments and increased proportionally with flow. There was a good linear correlation among these endocardial segments between flow and both thallium-201 (r = 0.78) and Tc-99m MIBI (r = 0.85) activity. Among Group II dogs, central ischemic endocardial flow (59 +/- 14%) was comparable to thallium-201 (70 +/- 18%) and Tc-99m MIBI (74 +/- 12%) activity. Similarly, relative endocardial flow in the intermediate ischemic region (71 +/- 11%) was comparable to thallium-201 (77 +/- 11%) and Tc-99m MIBI (81 +/- 10%) activity. Thus, myocardial uptake of Tc-99m MIBI and thallium-201 is comparable under conditions of low coronary flow and postischemic dysfunction and closely parallels flow alterations.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to evaluate the in vivo effect of acetylcholine on endothelial-damaged canine epicardial coronary arteries and the potential contribution of platelets to those acetylcholine-induced responses. Changes in left anterior descending artery cross-sectional area were determined by quantitative angiography in the closed chest anesthetized dog. Baseline cross-sectional area of the left anterior descending artery was not changed by removal of the endothelium by balloon-tipped catheter. Increased constrictor tone produced by prostaglandin F2 alpha was comparable in endothelium-intact and endothelium-removed vessels, supporting an endothelium-independent mechanism for prostaglandin F2 alpha in vivo. Acetylcholine produced anterior descending artery vasodilation with the endothelium intact; a comparable maximal dilator response was also obtained in the presence of increased constrictor tone (prostaglandin F2 alpha). In contrast, acetylcholine produced vasoconstriction of the anterior descending artery when the endothelium was removed. To evaluate the mechanism of acetylcholine-induced vasoconstriction in endothelium-removed vessels, the same protocol was completed in the presence of the platelet inhibitor indomethacin. Indomethacin did not alter baseline cross-sectional area or the dilator response to acetylcholine in endothelium-intact vessels. In contrast, the constrictor response in endothelium-removed vessels was antagonized, and a dilator response comparable with that in endothelium-intact vessels was produced by acetylcholine. The results of this study provide an experimental basis for the observations in human studies in which apparently atherosclerotic vessels constrict in response to acetylcholine. Removal of the endothelium in vivo abolishes the dilator response to acetylcholine and converts the acetylcholine response to vasoconstriction or vasospasm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that neutrophil accumulation and activation in postischemic myocardium may be responsible for myocardial no reflow, which is characterized by an incomplete restoration of blood flow after reperfusion. To examine this further, 11 open chest, anesthetized dogs received bolus injections of a bovine neutrophil antiserum that produced an average 81 +/- 5% depletion of circulating neutrophils, and 10 control dogs received nonimmune serum. Each animal underwent 2 h of left circumflex artery occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiography and radioactive microsphere blood flow studies were performed at baseline, 2 h of occlusion and early (approximately 5 min) and 4 h of reperfusion. During occlusion, both groups developed similar reductions in myocardial blood flow and levels of ischemic zone myocardial wall thinning. At early reperfusion, similar levels of hyperemia and regional hypokinesia were observed for both groups. By late reperfusion, both groups experienced significant no reflow in the subendocardium (p less than 0.05) and reduced reflow in the mid-myocardium. Regional depression in ischemic zone function persisted throughout the reperfusion period in both groups. However, infarct size expressed as a percent of left ventricular weight, assessed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, was smaller for the neutrophil depletion group compared with the control group (8.7 +/- 1.3% versus 13.1 +/- 1.8%, p less than 0.05). It is concluded that an 81% neutrophil depletion fails to modify the no reflow phenomenon or improve functional recovery after 2 h of coronary artery occlusion and 4 h of coronary reperfusion despite modification of the ultimate size of necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum and stool examinations for ova and parasites were performed in 63 adult Peruvian patients with \"hunger pain\" (HP) and other dyspeptic symptoms. No lesion capable of provoking HP was found at endoscopy in 50 (78%) of the 63 patients. Only 7 (12%) of the patients had evidence of active or healed peptic ulcers. Another 6 patients (10%) had either gastric erosions or duodenitis. One (2%) of the patients was infected with hookworm, a parasite that produces epigastric pain mimicking HP. The 12% rate of peptic ulcer in Peruvian patients with HP contrasts strongly with accumulated experience in most developed countries, whose rates of peptic ulcer associated with HP range from 60 to 75%. As the frequency of peptic ulcer is so variable in patients with HP, we suggest that the simple term \"hunger pain\" be used instead of \"peptic ulcer pain\" or \"ulcer dyspepsia\" to refer to the complaint of such patients.\r"

Essential dyspepsia refers to a subgroup of nonulcer dyspepsia patients who have no evidence of irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, or pancreaticobiliary disease. In 32 patients with essential dyspepsia, and 32 randomly selected dyspepsia-free community controls of similar age and sex, we measured gastric emptying of solids using Tc99m-Sulphur Colloid in a fried egg sandwich. Subjects with neuromuscular or other diseases that may alter gastric emptying were excluded. Symptoms were assessed by a standard questionnaire. Data processing was carried out \"blinded\" to the subjects' clinical status. Female patients took significantly longer to empty half the initial stomach activity (mean 90 min) than female controls (mean, 73 min; p = 0.02). The rate of emptying at 25 min was also significantly less in female patients than in controls. Female and male controls, and male patients, had similar emptying times. Delayed emptying was not associated with the occurrence of postprandial pain, belching, or nausea; there was a trend for the half-time rate of emptying to be greater in patients with abdominal distention. While gastric emptying of solids is slightly delayed in females with essential dyspepsia as a group, this may not explain their symptoms.\r"

One patient was treated successfully with 5-fluorouracil suppositories without any side effects, but the suppository regimen had to be stopped in three other patients because of severe rectal urgency. However, one of these patients was treated effectively with rectal administration of a high-dose 5-fluorouracil solution. Adenomas near the anastomotic site or dentate line were difficult to treat. Although severe urgency was seen in most patients, we think that the intraluminal administration of anticancer agents may prove effective in treating polyposis of the rectum retained after colectomy in familial polyposis.

Inc., Farmingdale, NY, U.S.A.) to determine if the addition of simethicone could improve visibility when administered the night before colonoscopy. Two parameters of visibility were assessed: amount of bubbles and degree of haziness. The effectiveness of a night-prior administration of Colyte to clean the colon of feculent debris was also examined. Patients receiving simethicone had significantly less bubbles (p less than 0.02), but haziness was not improved (p = 0.9). The presence of feculent debris that interfered with the colonoscopic examination was similar in both groups: simethicone 5 of 14 or 35% and placebo 7 of 12 or 58%. Eighty percent (four of five) of patients with feculent debris in the rectosigmoid colon had diverticulosis, and 50% (four of eight) patients with diverticulosis had feculent debris in the rectosigmoid. These data indicate that (a) the combination of simethicone plus Colyte administered the night before colonoscopy improves visibility by diminishing bubbles; (b) this dosage of simethicone is not effective in diminishing haziness when administered the night before colonoscopy; and (c) patients with diverticulosis are likely to have feculent debris in the rectosigmoid colon, and a precolonoscopy enema may be helpful when the diagnosis is known.\r"

The mechanism of this nonspecific histological change is not known, though it could be speculated to be secondary to a humoral factor related to RA. We conclude that hepatic involvement in adult RA is common but trivial and that routine liver biopsy is not indicated.\r"

They comprised about 50% of our surgical cases with esophageal varices. In 1981, we modified our operative procedure towards a more extended splenopancreatic disconnection (SPD) in order to prevent the \"stealing\" of the shunt through the pancreatic vein. In one group of 69 patients who underwent DSRS alone, the operative mortality was 2.9%; postoperative encephalopathy was seen in 17.4%, late hepatic failure in 40.6%, and recurrence of varices in 4.3%. In the other group, 43 patients who underwent DSRS with SPD, there were no operative deaths, no encephalopathy (better than DSRS alone at p less than 0.05), and late hepatic failure was seen in only 9.3% (better than DSRS alone at p less than 0.025), while the recurrence rate of 7% was the only statistical increase.

Anti-1F7 antibody reacts with approximately 57% of unfractionated T cells, 62% of CD4+ cells, and 54% of CD8+ cells. Although the 1F7 Ag is widely distributed among lymphoid cells, this Ag on CD4+ cells is preferentially expressed on the CDw29(4B4+) helper population. Moreover, anti-1F7 antibody further subdivides the CD4+CDw29+ cell subset into CDw29+1F7+ and CDw29+1F7- populations. The CD4+CDw29+1F7+ population of cells maximally proliferates to recall Ag such as tetanus toxoid, whereas helper function for PWM-driven IgG synthesis by B cells belongs to both the CD4+CDw29+1F7+ and CD4+CDw29+1F7- population of cells. The most prominent structure defined by this antibody is a 110-kDa molecule that is different from the 135-kDa, 160-kDa, and 185-kDa glycoproteins identified by anti-CDw29 antibody and the 180-kDa glycoprotein identified by UCHL-1 antibody. It is, however, related to the molecule recognized by anti-Ta1, an activation Ag on T cells. Furthermore, although the Ta1 molecule is recognized by anti-1F7 mAb, the 1F7 family of structures also includes molecules distinct from Ta1.\r"

  ".W": "Considerable evidence indicates that cloned CTL cell lines kill target cells by releasing toxic granules that contain a cytolytic protein, called perforin, and several serine esterases (granzymes A to F). However, primary CTL, such as the highly cytolytic peritoneal exudate lymphocyte (PEL) cell population, have been found by a hemolytic assay to have no perforin, or perhaps only borderline levels of that protein, suggesting that these cells use a different lytic mechanism. To determine whether or not primary CTL express the perforin gene, we have here compared mRNA from PEL CTL and from a cloned CTL cell line, 2C, by Northern blot analysis using a perforin cDNA probe. CD8+ PEL CTL contain approximately 30% of the amount of perforin message present in 2C. Moreover, depletion of CD8+ T cells from the total peritoneal exudate cell population removes both cytolytic activity and perforin message. We have previously shown that PEL CTL elicit the same changes in target cells as cloned CTL cell lines and are resistant to lysis by the toxic granules purified from these cells lines. Taken together these results are consistent with the view that primary CTL, as well as long term cloned CTL cell lines, exercise their cytolytic activity by means of perforin.\r"

  ".W": "The first hemopoietic stem cells to differentiate in Xenopus embryos arise from ventral blood island (VBI) mesoderm. Progeny of these stem cells contribute to larval E, macrophage, thymocyte, and B lymphocyte populations. When small pieces of mesoderm are transplanted to a central location within the VBI, the contribution of this mesoderm is predominantly to erythropoiesis and engraftment of lymphoid populations is minimal. The present experiments examined the influence of position within the VBI on the contribution of single stem cells to lymphoid populations. Pieces of diploid VBI mesoderm, containing an average of one hemopoietic stem cell, were transplanted to either a central or a peripheral location within the defined boundaries of the VBI of triploid, stage matched embryos. The number of animals with donor-derived cells in lymphoid populations was markedly increased when stem cells were grafted to a peripheral position. In three cases, stem cells contributed to lymphoid populations at the exclusion of erythroid populations. These data were consistent with the notion of either a lymphoid stem cell or restricted B and T lymphocyte precursors. These data also suggested that during embryogenesis, stochastic differentiation of hemopoietic stem cells was influenced by regional differences in the VBI microenvironment.\r"

The activation-driven lethal process is cell autonomous, is associated with a fragmentation of the cell's genome characteristic of the \"suicide process\" induced in immature T cells by glucocorticoids and in target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and is dependent upon transcription and translation, presumably associated with the expression of new gene products. We hypothesize that activation-driven cell death may be involved in vivo in the clonal deletion of auto-reactive T cells during T cell ontogeny.\r"

To determine whether the increased levels of TNF and IL-1 mRNA are a more general feature of mice with lupus nephritis we studied cytokine gene expression in female NZB x NZW F1 (NZB/W) mice by Northern blot analysis. Enhanced steady state levels of mRNA for TNF alpha and IL-1 beta, but not IL-1 alpha, were detected in the renal cortices of animals with lupus nephritis. To determine whether administration of TNF or IL-1 would accelerate renal injury and mortality, we injected murine rTNF alpha or rIL-1 alpha i.p. into female NZB/W or C3H/FeJ mice at two doses, 2.0 micrograms or 0.2 micrograms, three times weekly for 2 or 4 mo beginning at 2 or 4 mo of age. Administration of the lower dose of each cytokine accelerated renal disease and mortality rate when treatment was initiated at 4 mo of age. At the higher dose, neither cytokine promoted disease. Treatment administered from 2-4 mo of age did not accelerate renal disease. This observation suggests that in order to cause renal injury, these cytokines must interact with other pathologic features present in these animals after 4 mo of age. These findings support the hypothesis that TNF and IL-1 can contribute to nephritis in murine models of lupus. Taken together with previously published data, we propose that TNF and IL-1 have differential dose effects on renal disease. The dose of TNF and IL-1 and the stage of disease activity dictate the pathogenic action of these cytokines.\r"

To define the contribution of the CD5+B cell subset to the production of antibodies to ssDNA in SLE, we quantitated, purified, and functionally characterized circulating CD5+ and CD5-B cells in patients and in healthy subjects. We found that in SLE patients circulating CD5+B cells were not increased in number, and both CD5+ and C5-B cells spontaneously secreted antibodies to ssDNA. Studies of the mAb we generated using CD5+ and CD5-B cells revealed that two types of antibody to ssDNA are produced in SLE. The first type, of the IgM class, is produced mainly by CD5+B cells and displays a moderate affinity for ssDNA (Kd, 10(-6) to 10(-7) mol/liter) and is polyreactive, not dissimilar to the autoantibodies inducible in the normal human B cell repertoire by polyclonal activation. The second type, mostly of the IgG and IgA class, is produced mainly by CD5-B cells and displays a higher affinity (Kd, 10(-8) mol/liter) for and reacts only with ssDNA. The functional features of the high affinity anti-ssDNA antibodies and the phenotype of their producing B cells mimic those characteristic of a \"mature\" Ag-driven response, such as that to tetanus toxoid in tetanus toxoid-vaccinated subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The rejection of H-2b parental bone marrow graft by lethally irradiated F1 recipients, that is known as hybrid resistance (HR), is a multistep process. In a first step a 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-sensitive T cell recognizes the parental bone marrow cells and stimulates a macrophage-like cell to secrete IFN-alpha/beta (recognition phase). IFN-alpha/beta in turn activates a cyclophosphamide-sensitive NK-like cell that is the effector cell for HR (effector phase). In a previous paper we described that HR is specifically abrogated by the pretreatment of the F1 recipient with H-2b parental spleen cells. This abrogation is due to a Thy-1+CD5+CD4+CD8- nylon adherent suppressor cell of F1 origin. The aim of the present work was to study during which of the different phases of HR the activity of the suppressor cell is exerted. Our results showed that abrogation of HR in (C57BL/6 x C3H)F1 (B6C3F1) hybrids pretreated with B6 spleen cells results from: 1) the suppression of the 5-FU-sensitive T cell; 2) the suppression of the cyclophosphamide-sensitive NK-like cell; and 3) the disappearance of a humoral factor that is present in the serum of normal B6C3F1 hybrids and which seems to be involved in the effector phase of HR. The 5-FU-sensitive T cell is the only target of Thy-1+CD5+CD4+CD8- suppressor cell. The mechanisms responsible for the suppression of the NK-like effector cell and the disappearance of the humoral factor are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90063033\r", 
  ".W": "The opposing problems of graft-vs-host disease vs failure of alloengraftment severely limit the success of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation as a therapeutic modality. We have recently used a murine bone marrow transplantation model involving reconstitution of lethally irradiated mice with mixtures of allogeneic and syngeneic marrow to demonstrate that an allogeneic bone marrow subpopulation, removed by T cell depletion with rabbit anti-mouse brain serum and complement (RAMB/C), is capable of increasing levels of allogeneic chimerism. This effect was observed in an F1 into parent genetic combination lacking the potential for graft-vs-host disease, and radiation protection studies suggested that it was not due to depletion of stem cells by RAMB/C. We have now attempted to characterize the cell population responsible for increasing allogeneic chimerism in this model. The results indicate that neither mature T cells nor NK cells are responsible for this activity. However, an assay involving mixed marrow reconstitution in an Ly-5 congenic strain combination was found to be more sensitive to small degrees of stem cell depletion than radiation protection assays using three-fold titrations of bone marrow cells. Using this assay, we were able to detect some degree of stem cell depletion by treatment with RAMB/C, but not with anti-T cell mAb. Nevertheless, if the effects of alloresistance observed in this model are considered, the degree of stem cell depletion detected by such mixing studies in insufficient to account for the effects of RAMB/C depletion on levels of allogeneic chimerism, suggesting that another cell population with this property remains to be identified.\r"

  ".W": "Due to critical amino acid changes in the 72-89 sequence, the determinant of human (Hu) basic protein (BP) that induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats most likely differs from rat and guinea pig BP. To discern encephalitogenic sequence(s), the immunodominant epitopes recognized by Hu-BP-specific T cell lines were identified using synthetic peptides that corresponded to the Hu-BP sequence. The Hu-BP-reactive T cell line contained two distinct specificities, one directed at the 87-99 (Hu) sequence restricted by I-E, and the second directed at the 55-74 (Hu) sequence restricted by I-A. T cells specific for the 87-99 determinant recognized both Hu- and Rt-BP, were highly encephalitogenic, and accounted for the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-inducing activity of the Hu-BP line. T cells directed at the S55-74 (Hu) sequence did not recognize Rt-BP and were not encephalitogenic. The same TCR V genes (homologous to the mouse V alpha 2 and V beta 8 families) that we showed previously were utilized preferentially in response to the I-A restricted 72-89 encephalitogenic sequence were also present in T cell lines specific for both the S55-74 and S87-99 epitopes. These data indicate that encephalitogenic activity of BP in Lewis rats is related to discrete T cell epitopes that are present on or cross-react with rat-BP. Furthermore it would appear that genes in the TCR V alpha 2 and V beta 8 families are widely used in response to different BP epitopes restricted by either I-A or I-E molecules.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of the human U937 histiocytic lymphoma cell line with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) rendered the cells responsive to induction of TNF by LPS. Treatment with IL-6 reduced TNF production in GM-CSF-primed U937 cells. The inhibitory effect was most pronounced (approximately equal to 80%) when IL-6 was added either along with GM-CSF or within the first 3 h of GM-CSF treatment. Both GM-CSF or IL-6 inhibited [3H]TdR uptake in U937 cells, and simultaneous treatment with GM-CSF and IL-6 resulted in an additive inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. However, the inhibition of TNF production could not be explained by the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on cell growth, nor was it due to a reduction in cell viability. An inhibition of TNF production by IL-6 was also demonstrated in cultured human peripheral blood monocytes. Treatment with IL-6 also resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the 17-kDa TNF band revealed by SDS-PAGE after labeling monocytes with [35S]cysteine and immunoprecipitation with anti-TNF mAb. In addition, treatment with IL-6 resulted in a reduction of monocyte in vitro cytotoxicity for tumor target cells. Finally, in mice sensitized by the administration of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, the injection of IL-6 significantly reduced the levels of TNF found in the serum upon challenge with LPS. Inasmuch as TNF is known to be an inducer of IL-6, the inhibitory action of IL-6 on TNF production may represent the negative arm of a regulatory circuit. The inhibitory action of IL-6 on TNF production is consistent with a predominantly antiinflammatory role of IL-6 in the intact organism.\r"

Because studies have demonstrated that IL-2R can be expressed on the surface of human peripheral blood monocytes, we chose to investigate whether IL-1 beta mRNA could be directly induced in purified human monocytes by treatment with Il-2 and, if so, to analyze the second messenger pathways by which it may be controlled. Human monocytes do not spontaneously express IL-1 beta mRNA, but can express the gene as soon as 1 h after treatment with IL-2. The level of IL-1 beta mRNA induced by IL-2 at 5 h in human monocytes was about one-fourth that induced by LPS. LPS induction of IL-1 beta mRNA in human monocytes can be blocked by either an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKc) 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine or an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin (CaM) kinase N-(6-aminohexyl) 5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, suggesting that both PKc and CaM kinase are involved in transducing signals initiated by LPS. In contrast, IL-2 induction of IL-1 beta mRNA expression is blocked only by 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, suggesting that PKc, and not CaM kinase, is activated by IL-2. These data suggest that overlapping but distinct second messenger pathways are involved in the transduction of signals initiated by IL-2 and LPS.\r"

  ".W": "The role of IL-6 in the antiproliferative effect of IL-1 for tumor cell lines was investigated using IL-1-sensitive cell lines. Human recombinant IL-1 alpha and IL-6 both inhibited the growth of an IL-1-sensitive cloned human melanoma cell line (A375-C6). However, IL-1 has greater maximum growth inhibitory activity than IL-6. Conditioned medium of the tumor cells that were treated with IL-1 contained IL-6 as determined by ELISA. Northern blot analysis revealed that IL-6 mRNA expression increased in IL-1-treated cells. In addition, antibody against human IL-6 neutralized about 50% of the antiproliferative effect of IL-1. The growth of an IL-1-resistant clone of A375 cells (A375-C5), which cannot be shown to express any detectable IL-1R, was inhibited by IL-6 to the same degree as A375-C6 cells. The A375-C5 cell line did not produce IL-6 or increase IL-6 mRNA after stimulation with IL-1. These results indicate that IL-6 mediates in part the antiproliferative effect of IL-1 on A375-C6 cells by acting as an autocrine antiproliferative factor. IL-1 also inhibited the growth of a malignant human mammary cell line (MDA-MB-415). IL-6 exhibited only slight growth inhibition in this cell line. Neither IL-6 production nor IL-6 mRNA expression was induced in this cell line by IL-1. Antibody against IL-6 did not neutralize the antiproliferative effect of IL-1. Therefore, for MDA-MB-415 cells IL-6 appeared not to be involved in the antiproliferative effect of IL-1. These results indicate that the antiproliferative effect of IL-1 involves at least two pathways, one IL-6 dependent and another IL-6 independent. The contribution of IL-6 to the antiproliferative effect of TNF was also examined. IL-6 appeared not to play a role in the antiproliferative effect of TNF in these cell lines.\r"

We have studied the binding of eight anti-MIR mAb to synthetic peptides containing the sequence segment 67-76 of the human alpha-subunit, and peptide analogues containing single residue substitutions of this sequence. We used also a peptide where both Asp70 and Asp71 were substituted by glycine residues. The binding of six anti-MIR mAb was strongly influenced by several substitutions. All these mAb required residues Asn68, and Pro69 for binding. Five of them required also Asp71 and Tyr72. Substitution of Asp70, which is an Ala residue in Torpedo AcChR, was irrelevant for the binding of an anti-Torpedo and an anti-Electrophorus mAb, and moderately reduced the binding of an anti-human mAb (no. 203). Substitution of Trp67 moderately reduced the binding of some of these mAbs. A mAb of this group (the antihuman mAb no. 198) bound in a manner only slightly influenced by ionic strength, whereas the binding of the other five mAb of this group was very sensitive to the ionic strength. Two anti-Electrophorus MIR mAb bound similarly to all peptide analogues in low ionic strength. At high ionic strength only the peptide analogue where Asp 70 was changed to a Gly residue bound significantly. This may indicate that the Electrophorus MIR has an uncharged residue at this position, as does Torpedo AcChR. Residues at position 73, 74, 75, and 76 were of little or no importance for the binding of all anti-MIR mAb. A free amino terminus was essential for the binding of most mAb. The results of competition experiments between different peptides and native AcChR for mAb binding were consistent with those obtained in direct binding experiments.\r"

A cross-reactivity between BB10 and a mAb anti-Leishmania gp63, which is a \"fibronectin (Fn)-like\" molecule, containing the L-arginine-L-glycyl-L-aspartyl (RGD) cell attachment domain indicated the presence of such a sequence in the common structure present on eosinophil and B cell FcERII. The synthetic tetrapeptide RGDS as well as its inverted sequence (SDGR) reduced the binding of BB10 and anti-Fn mAb to eosinophils and B cells. Flow microfluorometry analysis revealed a variable binding of BB10 and anti-Fn mAb to eosinophils purified from different patients, results compatible with recent findings on the inducibility of FcERIIb. The significant inhibition of IgE-dependent cytotoxicity against parasite targets by preincubation of eosinophils with BB10, anti-Fn and anti-CD23 mAb, with anti-RGDS polyclonal antibodies or with the SDGR peptide suggested the requirement of this cell adhesion sequence for the function of low affinity FcERII. The presence of such a sequence in the C-terminal domain of B cell FcERII raised the possibility of its role in B cell adhesion or B cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "A chimeric human-mouse anti-T lymphocyte mAb (CHT2; SDZ 214-380) has been constructed by cloning the variable region exons of both the L and H chains from the murine hybridoma RFT2 which have CD7 specificity and reactivity with a 40-kDa Ag. The variable L chain exon was joined to the human C kappa, and the variable H chain exon was joined to the human IgG1 region exon encoding the human allotype nGlm(z), nGlm(a). The gene constructs were introduced by electroporation into SP2/0, a non-Ig-producing murine myeloma. The identical tissue reactivity of the newly made CHT2 and the original murine RFT2 mAb (CD7) was confirmed by blocking experiments as well as by immunohistology and flow cytometry. Because this new mAb may have clinical use, the CD7 Ag expression of T lineage cells has also been quantitated in double and triple immunofluorescence assays in combinations with mAb to restricted forms of leukocyte common Ag that designate unprimed (CD45R+) and primed T lymphocyte populations (UCHL1+). CHT2 shows very strong reactivity with large thymic blast cells and cortical thymocytes from which T-ALL originates. Strong staining is seen on CD45R+ unprimed \"virgin\" T lymphocytes, whereas the expression on UCHL1+ primed \"memory\" cell types is weaker unless these cells are reactivated by mitogens or Ag. Thus CHT2 may spare a substantial population of resting memory T cells which is relevant to its potential therapeutic use. In addition the chimeric antibody had a greater in vitro antibody dependent cytotoxicity and a prolonged half-life (4.2 to 5.0 days) in Rhesus monkeys.\r"

Five different antigenic sites were identified in the SIVmac peptide by use of 34 mAb against this peptide and two different sites were similarly demonstrated in the HIV-1 peptide by use of 10 peptide-specific mAb. Within some sites the mAb could be subgrouped to show a progressively more narrow epitopic dependence on amino acids in the central part of the site. Three SIVmac peptide mAbs had a remarkably narrow amino acid dependence, Glu584 and Tyr586. Anti-peptide mAbs reacting with the site Trp596 to Gln602 effectively blocked the capacity of the peptide to react with human postinfection HIV-2 antibodies previously demonstrated to have a restricted reactivity involving this site. No similar blocking was seen when mAb specific for Leu587 to Gln590 were used except with a single broadly reacting HIV-2 serum, which depended on an amino acid at a distance of only 6 residues, Trp596. A cross-reacting site involving amino acids Ala582 to Glu588/Lys588 was identified with mAb and rabbit hyperimmune sera against the two peptides. This site was not accessible in the intact transmembrane proteins as determined by ELISA and Western blot tests. Antipeptide mAb against other sites as well as rabbit sera reacted strongly in these tests and can be used as type-specific, component-unique reagents.\r"

  ".W": "The invariant chain (Ii) is a nonpolymorphic glycoprotein that associates with the Ia alpha- and beta-chains of MHC class II Ag during their transport to the cell surface. Although surface expression of Ia can occur in the absence of Ii, it has not been shown whether the intracellular association of Ia and Ii affects the biosynthetic rate or specificity of posttranslational modifications to the individual molecules. Analysis of transfected cell lines carrying either Ia, Ii, or both Ia and Ii demonstrated efficient assembly of alpha-beta whether or not Ii was present. Pulse-chase studies and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that Ii did not affect the addition of Ia N-linked oligosaccharide chains, or the extent or rate of their conversion to the complex form, nor did it affect the sulfation of alpha and beta glycoproteins. Ii also did not affect the rate of Ia synthesis or appearance of Ia at the cell surface. In contrast, Ia dramatically affected the posttranslational modification of Ii. Although invariant chain was modified by addition of fatty acid, N-linked oligosaccharide, and glycosaminoglycan in the absence of Ia, the processing of Ii-linked oligosaccharide into more acidic, terminally glycosylated forms was significantly less when Ia was absent, and although conversion to proteoglycan did occur, the glycosaminoglycan chains were significantly shorter than normal. The disappearance of radiolabel from the 31,000 Da form of Ii was faster when Ia was present, and the processing of Ii was more rapid when it was associated with Ia. Thus, the rate and manner in which Ii enters and passes through the Golgi is critically affected by Ia.\r"

We used specific 125I-labeled mAb to IgM, C3b, and IgG to measure the stoichiometries of these C-opsonized IC. They contained 10 to 60 C3b and 10 to 30 IgM per PM2 dsDNA, had no detectable IgG, and the vast majority of the C3b was bound to the IgM, and not to the dsDNA. These stoichiometries are in contrast to those we observed for comparable E-bound IC prepared with IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies (100 to 200 C3b, and 200 to 500 IgG). Our results help explain the greater lability of the IgM IC with respect to IA as evidenced by their plasma-mediated release from human E (presumably due to factor I), and confirm previous predictions of a lower density of \"packing\" of IgM on dsDNA, compared to IgG. The detailed stoichiometry of C3b capture by the IgM IC (typically 1.5 to 3 C3b per IgM) suggests that individual IgM molecules with multiple C3b facilitate IC binding to clusters of CR1. Finally, comparison of the IgM/dsDNA IC with other IgM IC which have been investigated with respect to C activation, and review of the proposed mechanism by which IgM activates C, suggests that the nature of the Ag plays a fundamental role in determining whether or not an IgM IC can activate C and participate in IA.\r"

  ".W": "The CD7 gp40 molecule is a member of the Ig gene superfamily and is expressed on T cell precursors before their entry into the thymus during fetal development. N-terminal amino acids 1-107 of CD7 are highly homologous to Ig kappa-L chains whereas the carboxyl-terminal region of the extracellular domain of CD7 is proline-rich and has been postulated to form a stalk from which the Ig domain projects. To define potential functional regions of CD7, we have studied the surface topography of the CD7 Ag by synthesizing peptides corresponding to linear sequences within the CD7 extracellular domains, by raising polyclonal anti-CD7 rabbit sera against these peptides, and by computer analysis of the primary CD7 amino acid sequence. Polyclonal anti-CD7 sera were studied using indirect immunofluorescence, RIA, radioimmunoprecipitation, and Western blot assays. Computer analysis was performed comparing the CD7 sequence with all other known protein sequences. We found that three CD7 epitopes defined by peptides CD7-1A (AA 1-38), CD7-4 (AA 48-74), and CD7-7 (AA 129-146) were available for binding antibody on the surface of the CD7 molecule. Using computer analysis, we transposed the amino acid sequence of the CD7 Ig kappa-like N-terminal domain of CD7 onto the spatial coordinates of REI, a previously reported Ig kappa-molecule highly homologous (48%) to the CD7 N-terminal Ig-like region. Based on computer analysis of this putative CD7 three-dimensional structure, both the CD7-1A and CD7-4 regions protruded from the surface of the N-terminal domain of the CD7 molecule. Finally, comparison of the CD7 transmembrane sequence with CD4 and HIV transmembrane sequences and with respiratory syncytial virus fusion sequences demonstrated similar sequence motifs among these molecules.\r"

  ".U": "90063053\r", 
  ".W": "The L-arginine content of the extracellular fluid in sites of predominant macrophage infiltration is reduced below plasma levels due to the activity of macrophage-derived arginase. Investigation of the effects of altered L-arginine availability on macrophage physiology reveals that culture of rat peritoneal macrophages in media containing L-arginine in the concentrations present in inflammatory lesions (less than 0.1 mM) enhances activation-associated functions. In contrast, culture in the higher L-arginine concentrations found in standard tissue culture media (0.4 to 1.2 mM) suppresses most macrophage functions (superoxide production, phagocytosis, and protein synthesis). An exception is the tumor cytotoxicity of Corynebacterium parvum-elicited macrophages which is enhanced by culture in supraphysiologic concentrations of L-arginine. Work reported here investigated the mechanisms for these L-arginine-dependent effects and, more specifically, the role of the recently described oxidative L-arginine deiminase pathway in the regulation of macrophage physiology. Overnight culture of resident or C. parvum-elicited peritoneal macrophages in media containing increasing concentrations of L-arginine (6 microM to 1 mM) resulted in: inhibition of electron transport chain activity (resident and C. parvum-elicited macrophages), increased lactate production (resident macrophages), and decreased ATP content (resident and C. parvum-elicited macrophages). In line with these findings, viability was markedly decreased after 2 days of culture when the initial L-arginine concentration was greater than or equal to 0.1 mM. As shown before, increasing media concentrations of L-arginine were associated with suppression of superoxide production and cytotoxicity in resident macrophages, and with reduced superoxide production and increased cytotoxicity in C. parvum-elicited macrophages. All L-arginine-dependent metabolic and functional alterations, as well as the loss of viability, were prevented by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a specific inhibitor of the oxidative L-arginine deiminase pathway. These results demonstrate that flux of L-arginine through the oxidative L-arginine deiminase pathway results in the inhibition of oxidative metabolism in rat macrophages. This metabolic inhibition may, through alterations in the macrophage high energy phosphate stores, mediate the suppression of cell functions and result ultimately in cell death.\r"

The data reveal a major difference with respect to the regulation of receptor-mediated calcium responses in these two cells. Thus, the pkC activator phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (Pdbu) enhances calcium responses induced via CD3 and CD2 molecules in normal T cells by accelerating the rate of elevation of intracellular calcium levels and increasing the maximum change in calcium concentration achieved. In contrast, Pdbu inhibits both CD3- and CD2-induced calcium responses in Jurkat cells. Pdbu does not influence calcium responses generated by the guanine nucleotide-binding protein activator, aluminium fluoride, indicating that the effect of pkC occurs at a point proximal to a guanine nucleotide-binding protein regulation of T cell calcium responses.\r"

  ".W": "Monocyte adhesion to endothelium represents the first step in the emigration of this leukocyte from blood to tissue during such pathologic and physiologic processes as atherosclerotic plaque development, wound healing, and inflammation. We have examined the role of carbohydrate moieties in the binding of mononuclear cells to endothelium in vitro. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) completely inhibited binding of the human monocytic cell line U937 to pig or human endothelial cells (EC). The inhibition was abolished by the presence of N-acetyl glucosamine, a preferred ligand for WGA. This sugar itself, however, had no effect on monocytic cell binding to EC, suggesting that WGA is inhibiting the cell-cell interaction by binding to a distinct sugar moiety. We tested a series of simple and phosphorylated sugars for the ability to inhibit U937 cell binding to EC. Two phosphorylated disaccharides, lactose-1-phosphate and maltose-1-phosphate, but not 14 other sugars, caused complete suppression of monocyte adhesion to EC. Among the inactive sugars were mannose-6-phosphate and fructose-1-phosphate, which have been shown by others to markedly suppress lymphocyte adhesion to EC. A nonionic detergent, n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside), which contains a sugar group as a hydrophilic moiety, also inhibited U937 cell or human monocyte binding to human or porcine EC. The inhibition was observed at a nontoxic concentration of octyl glucoside and appeared to be due to an effect on the monocytic cell rather than the EC. When suboptimal doses of WGA and octyl glucoside were added in combination to the U937 cell-EC adhesion assay, the level of inhibition was greatly reduced when compared with either of the inhibitors alone, suggesting an interaction between these two blocking agents. Lactose-1-phosphate, but not octyl glucoside or WGA, blocked neutrophil adhesion to EC. In summary, our results indicate that specific cell surface carbohydrate groups are required for the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "As a model to perhaps better indicate potential in vivo tissue inflammatory events, the generation of leukotriene (LT)B4, 20-OH-LTB4, sulfidopeptide LT, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) from human whole blood stimulated with zymosan was compared with that produced by isolated human neutrophils suspended either in buffer or plasma. Several reports have shown that substantial LTB4 biosynthesis could be induced after addition of zymosan to whole blood, but little was known concerning the generation of other important lipid mediators, or the cellular source of these. We have shown that, in spite of some subject variation, the zymosan-induced production of 20-OH-LTB4, LTB4, and LTE4 reached maxima within 30 to 60 min with 1.1, 2.8, and 0.60 ng/10(6) neutrophils, respectively. These concentrations would be sufficient to induce significant biologic effects. Studies with isolated cell mixtures suggested that the neutrophil was the primary source of the lipid mediators or their precursors in this system, although a number of other cell types contributed as accessory cells to the final amounts and mix of mediators produced. The ratio of neutrophils to accessory cells in mixed cell experiments dramatically modified the metabolic pattern of leukotriene generation. The concentration of LTB4 was increased in the presence of RBC and that of LTE4 when platelets were present. These results suggested that cellular cooperation and transcellular biosynthesis played a key role in the overall production of eicosanoids such as LTB4 and LTC4. The concomitant synthesis of PAF in isolated cells and in whole blood was also determined as another member of the complex lipid mediator network. Maximal production of cell-associated PAF was observed within 30 min after the initiation of phagocytosis and reached levels of 3 to 5 ng PAF/10(6) neutrophils. When other cells were present in a coincubation system, the time course for production of PAF was not altered, but maximal concentration of PAF was lower, perhaps as a result of enhanced PAF metabolism. Study of eicosanoids and other lipid mediator production in mixed cell populations provides insight into those events occurring within tissues, where cross-cell signaling and transcellular biosynthesis may occur.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the role of the steroid in macrophage activation in vivo. Peritoneal macrophages from normal and vitamin D3-deficient mice were obtained after i.p. injection of activating or eliciting agents. Cells obtained from vitamin D3-deficient mice exhibited defected capabilities to perform anti-tumor activities (cytostasis and cytolysis) and to form oxygen reduction products (H2O2 and O2-). On the other hand, the level of the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase was unaffected by vitamin D3 deficiency. In vitro, incubation of macrophages with 1,25(OH)2D3 enhanced their anti-tumor activities, but did not affect the cells' capacity to produce H2O2 and O2-, or acid phosphatase. Our results suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 is essential for macrophage activation in vivo. However, in vitro, the hormone is only partially capable of affecting the macrophage functions, probably because of the maturation state of the cells.\r"

Cell sorting of the two main fractions of B and T cells derived from the spleen revealed that PEA is expressed in normal B cells (sIg+). The expression of PEA mRNA was markedly enhanced after a short incubation (3 h) of cells with LPS or Salmonella typhimurium. This was not the case when these cells were incubated with Con A during the same period of time; whereas, in thymocytes the presence of PEA mRNA was exclusively dependent upon mitogenic stimulus (Con A) and could be detected after 24 h of in vitro incubation. Extracts of cells were also found to contain immune reactive enkephalins, indicating that the PEA mRNA is translated. These results support the concept that neuropeptides, such as enkephalins, have a role in the modulation of the immune response and may participate in the bidirectional communication between the nervous and immune systems.\r"

Raji lymphoblasts readily metabolized PAF by deacetylation-reacylation at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. Binding studies conducted at 4 degrees C demonstrated specific binding that reached saturation within 80 min. This binding was only partially reversible. Scatchard analysis of PAF binding data revealed a single class of PAF binding sites (17,800 +/- 3,600/cell) with a K of 2.3 +/- 0.3 nM. These high-affinity PAF binding sites were shown to be functional receptors, as 100 pM to 1 microM PAF increased free intracellular calcium in a dose-dependent manner. The dose of PAF necessary to achieve half maximal calcium mobilization response was 6.3 nM, which was in the range of the K for the receptor calculated from the binding studies. The structurally dissimilar PAF receptor antagonists CV-3988 and BN52021 inhibited the PAF-induced calcium changes at doses that competed with PAF binding. These studies provide the first evidence for a functional PAF receptor expressed on a lymphocyte cell line.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a small RNA virus that is dependent on helper functions provided by hepatitis B virus. The hepatitis delta Ag (HDAg) is the only protein known to be made from the viral genome, from an ORF with a coding capacity of 214 amino acids. The immunogenic epitopes of HDAg and the immune response to it were mapped by the use of synthetic peptides, antipeptide antibodies, and human mAb. Antipeptide sera covering approximately 60% of the linear sequence reacted with liver-derived HDAg. Antisera from HDV-infected humans, chimpanzees, and woodchucks reacted with from 2 to 13 of 15 peptides. The epitopes of two human anti-HD mAb were mapped to overlapping but distinct epitopes in the region around residues 106-123. Sera from infected humans, chimpanzees, and woodchucks were also tested by competition with the mAb. Use of the peptides and antipeptide sera defined one region in the sequence (residues 52-93) which is immunodominant in the immune response to HDAg. Reactivity of both peptides and antipeptide antibodies was very broad, covering most or all of the linear sequence. Competition assays also provided information on conformational epitopes, as well as the sequential epitopes defined by direct assays. The peptides and antipeptide antibodies should be useful in new assay development, in dissecting the anti-HD response in terms of chronic vs self-limited infection, and in studying the role of anti-HD in infection and recovery.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) provides an excellent model for studying viral-B lymphocyte interaction in the immune system, which plays an important role in the outcome of an acute disease. Bone marrow B lymphocyte subpopulations, at various times postinfection, were studied in genetically C57BL/6 and resistant A/J mice, infected with pathogenic L2-MHV3 and its nonpathogenic variant, YAC-MHV3. B lineage cell subpopulations were identified by double immunofluorescence assays using mAb of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, 14.8 and cytoplasmic (cu) or surface (su) Ig mu-chains. Results revealed diminished percentage and absolute number in the bone marrow 14.8+ mu+ B lymphocyte subpopulations, including pre-B (cu+ su-) and B (cu+ su+) cells of L2-MHV3-infected susceptible C57BL/6 mice; whereas, slight or no increase was evident in the cell subpopulations of L2-MHV3 infected resistant A/J mice or in YAC-MHV3 infected in both strains of mice. Abnormal large-sized forms of the 14.8+ mu+ cells occurred, at 48-h postinfection, in L2-MHV3-infected susceptible C57BL/6 mice only. In contrast, no change in the percentage and absolute number of precursor cells (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase positive) and pre pre-B cells (14.8+ mu-) were detected in all infected mice. In vitro L2-MHV3 infection of C57BL/6 bone marrow purified B lineage cell subpopulations showed that pre-B (cu+ su-) and B (cu+ su+) cells became abnormally large in size and depleted in number as a result of a productive and lytic viral replication. Low L2-MHV3 viral replication occurred in these cell subpopulations of A/J mice but no YAC-MHV3 virus was produced in the cells of both strains of mice. Pre pre-B (14.8+ mu-) cells in both strains were not permissive to L2-MHV3 or YAC-MHV3 viral replication. These results are discussed with regard to the role of humoral immunodeficiency in the pathogenic process.\r"

Total molecules of C3 bound/parasite after 60 min was similar for parasites incubated in normal human serum, normal human serum adsorbed to remove natural antibody, or either serum source chelated with Mg-EGTA to limit activation to the alternative pathway. A comparison of parasites grown to early, mid, late-log or stationary phases revealed no difference in the extent and kinetics of C3 binding. C3 bound covalently to the parasite primarily through a hydroxylamine resistant (putatively amide) linkage. Of the bound C3, 75% was present as hemolytically inactive iC3b. Nearly 50% of the bound C3 was spontaneously released within 30 min at 37 degrees C. This spontaneous release was due to an unusual proteolytic cleavage event that released C3 from the C3 acceptor on the parasite surface. These results define and characterize the unusual features of C3 binding to L. donovani promastigotes during incubation in serum.\r"

For antibody detection an immunoprecipitation gel assay was performed with radioactively labeled polypeptides produced by in vitro translation of RNA of different P-gene regions. Thus, five antigenic regions were identified. All anti-P antibody positive sera reacted with carboxy-terminal P-poly-peptides, a subset with polypeptides of the amino-terminal and middle region, and none reacted with P-protein derived from the most sequence variable region. Anti-P antibodies were detected at very high frequency in sera of acute (73%) and chronically infected patients without HCC (87%), but less often in HCC patients (27%). These data indirectly demonstrate the expression of most hepatitis B virus P-gene sequences and the immunogenicity of P-proteins in vivo. Moreover, they establish hepatitis B virus anti-P-antibodies as a frequent serologic marker of infection and identify the carboxy-terminal region of the P-protein(s) as immunodominant.\r"

Interestingly, both proteins were serologically and immunochemically recognized by leukemia-specific TL.4 antiserum. The quantity of cell surface T13 was significantly greater than T3 possibly due to the less efficient splicing of T3 transcripts in the L cell nucleus; both genes directed the synthesis of cytoplasmic RNA containing an unspliced intron 3 as assessed by S1 analysis. In toto, the results suggest that T3c is similar or perhaps identical with the novel TL product previously identified on the surface of certain x-ray-induced BALB/c leukemias.\r"

  ".W": "T cell hybridomas were generated from CD3+, CD4-, CD8- splenocytes and fetal thymocytes. V gamma 1-expressing proteins present on these murine TCR-gamma delta hybridomas were identified by using an anti-TCR V gamma 1 peptide serum. This antiserum specifically immunoprecipitated 41-kDa TCR V gamma-C gamma 4 chains and 31-kDa TCR V gamma-C gamma 1/2 chains from distinct heterodimers expressed on the TCR-gamma delta T cell hybridomas. The RNA from a hybridoma with a 31-kDa TCR-gamma chain hybridized with a V gamma 1 probe but failed to hybridize with a V gamma 2 probe. In contrast, the RNA from a hybridoma with a 32-kDa TCR-gamma chain hybridized with a V gamma 2 probe. This 32-kDa TCR-gamma chain was not immunoprecipitated by the anti-V gamma 1 serum. These data were consistent with the conclusion that the 31-kDa protein was the product of a V gamma 1 to C gamma 2 rearrangement, whereas the 32-kDa protein was the product of a V gamma 2 to C gamma 1 rearrangement. Furthermore, Southern analyses confirmed that the 32-kDa protein was the product of a V gamma 1.2-J gamma 2 rearrangement, and all three of the 41-kDa TCR-gamma chains were the results of V gamma 1.1-J gamma 4 rearrangements. This was the first demonstration at the clonal level of TCR-gamma proteins which use members of the V gamma 1 gene family, as well as the C gamma 2 constant region. Additional biochemical analyses of the TCR-gamma and -delta proteins from three independently derived C gamma 4-bearing T cell hybridomas suggested that most of the molecular mass diversity observed in the bulk subpopulation of peripheral C gamma 4-containing heterodimers may be contributed by the TCR-delta chains.\r"

The alpha subunit of Fc epsilon RI and most Fc receptors are homologous members of the Ig superfamily. By contrast, the beta and gamma subunits from Fc epsilon RI are not homologous to the Ig superfamily. The gamma-chains do share a region of high homology with the zeta-chain of the TCR. No homology has been found to date for beta with any published sequence. Here, we report that a single copy gene encodes Fc epsilon RI beta and that the locus for Fc epsilon RI beta is found on mouse chromosome 19, genetically linked to the Ly-1 (Ly-12) locus and in a region that also contains Ly-10 and Ly-44 (CD20). Homology comparisons among these molecules reveal limited regions of homology between Fc epsilon RI beta and Ly-44 (CD20) as well as other striking similarities: both molecules have four putative transmembrane segments and a probably topology where both amino- and carboxytermini protrude into the cytoplasm. In addition, we show that a single gene for FC epsilon RI gamma is found at the distal end of mouse chromosome 1, clustered in a region where Fc epsilon RI alpha has also been linked to Fc gamma RII. At least one of the two forms of Fc gamma RII has recently been shown to contain gamma subunits identical to the gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI. The close association of the genes for Fc epsilon RI alpha, FC gamma RII, and their shared gamma subunits raises interesting implications regarding coordinate regulation of gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Autocrine production of growth factors may contribute to the rapid and fatal proliferation of acute hematologic malignancies. We have investigated whether the more controlled growth of less aggressive malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may be associated with autocrine production of growth inhibitory factors. TNF inhibits the growth of both normal and leukemic hemopoietic progenitor cells. We find that exogenous TNF reduces the viability and DNA synthesis of purified myeloid cells from patients with CML and inhibits myeloid colony formation by patient progenitor cells. However, unlike progenitor cells from normal donors, patient myeloid progenitor cells also constitutively express mRNA for TNF and secrete functional TNF protein in culture. This endogenous TNF impedes the growth of CML cells because anti-TNF mAb shown to neutralize bioactive human TNF increases CML cell DNA synthesis whereas non-neutralizing anti-TNF mAb has no effect. Production of TNF by CML cells is not associated with production of lymphotoxin (TNF-beta), IL-1 or IL-6. TNF-mediated autocrine growth inhibition may contribute to the maintenance of the stable, chronic phase of this disease and similar mechanisms may operate in other malignancies to limit tumor proliferation. Competition between autocrine growth promoting and inhibiting factors may underlie the observed differences in biologic behavior between acute and chronic malignancies.\r"

To study the possibility of using allograft rejection to generate tumor-specific immunity, we have introduced an allogeneic class I histocompatibility gene, the H-2Kb gene, into a k haplotype tumor, K36.16, by DNA-mediated gene transfer. The K36.16 tumor grows readily and does not confer protective immunity in AKR mice. A total of 37 H-2Kb-transfected K36.16 clones (Kb/K36.16) was isolated and studied individually. The Kb/K36.16 clones were found to differ significantly in the amount of the exogenous H-2Kb antigens expressed on their cell surface. Moreover, as a result of the transfection, the level of expression of the endogenous H-2Dk Ag was also altered when compared to that of the parental K36.16 tumor cells. All the Kb/K36.16 clones that were positive for the H-2Kb Ag were rejected by the semisyngeneic AKR mice. Moreover, some of these Kb/K36.16 clones were also rejected by syngeneic (AKR x C57BL/10)F1 mice. In consequence of immunization with the Kb/K36.16 clones, the AKR and F1 mice were able to survive a subsequent challenge of the wild-type, unmodified, parental K36.16 tumor cells. More importantly, some of these Kb/K36.16 clones demonstrated an active and specific immunotherapeutic effect, and they were able to eradicate the growth of the parental K36.16 tumor cells in AKR mice. This observation therefore reinforces the feasibility of using DNA-mediated gene transfer as a molecular approach to abrogate tumor growth.\r"

No marked difference was detected in the frequency of antibody secreting hybridomas in the fusions generated from mice immunized with the four anti-HMW-MAA mAb, suggesting that the idiotopes expressed by each of them display similar immunogenicity in a syngeneic combination. The number of antiidiotypic mAb that did not inhibit the binding of immunizing mAb to melanoma cells was higher than that of those that died, suggesting that idiotopes not associated with the Ag-combining site are more immunogenic than those that are. The idiotopes recognized by mAb were not detected on a large panel of anti-HLA Class I mAb, anti-HLA Class II mAb, and anti-human melanoma-associated Ag mAb. The latter included also mAb that cross-inhibit the immunizing anti-HMW-MAA mAb. The idiotopes recognized by mAb were not detected on the isolated H and L chain of the immunizing anti-HMW-MAA mAb. Cross-blocking experiments with a selected number of antiidiotypic mAb identified three distinct idiotopes on mAb 149.53, 225.28, and TP41.2 and two on mAb 763.74. Three, 5, 2, and 5 antiidiotypic mAb to idiotopes within the Ag-combining site of mAb 149.53, 225.28, 763.74, and TP41.2, respectively, were tested for their ability to induce anti-HMW-MAA antibodies. Serological and immunochemical assays detected anti-HMW-MAA antibodies only in sera from BALB/c mice immunized with mAb MK2-23.

In this study, we have mapped the portion of the HLA class I molecule involved in this protective effect by exploiting this HLA/H-2 dichotomy. Hybrid class I genes were produced by exon-shuffling between the HLA-B7 and H-2Dp genes, and transfected into the class I Ag-deficient B-lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL) C1R. Only those transfectants expressing class I Ag containing the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of the HLA molecule are protected from NK, suggesting the \"protective epitope\" is located within these domains. Since a glycosylation difference exists between HLA and H-2 class I Ag within these domains (i.e., at amino acid residue 176), the role of carbohydrate in the class I protective effect was examined. HLA-B7 mutant genes encoding proteins which either lack the normal carbohydrate addition site at amino acid residue 86 (B7M86-) or possess an additional site at residue 176 (B7M176+) were transfected into C1R. Transfectants expressing either mutant HLA-B7 Ag were protected from NK. Thus, carbohydrate is probably not integral to a class I \"protective epitope.\" The potential for allelic variation in the ability of HLA class I Ag to protect C1R target cells from NK was examined in HLA-A2, A3, B7, and Bw58 transfectants. Although no significant variation exists among the HLA-A3, B7, and Bw58 alleles, HLA-A2 appears unable to protect. Comparison of amino acid sequences suggests a restricted number of residues which may be relevant to the protective effect.\r"

They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin disease and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. We have studied the ability of arachidonic acid, prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4 to enhance the growth of cultured human melanocytes. Of these compounds, only leukotriene C4 and leukotriene D4 were capable of stimulating melanocyte proliferation. In addition, cultured melanocytes metabolized leukotriene C4 to leukotriene E4 with greater than 60% conversion in less than three hours. Melanocytes grown on suboptimal media (doubling time 12-20 days) respond in a dose-dependent fashion to leukotriene C4, with a significant difference from control noted at 28 days with a concentration of LTC4 of 30 nM and a doubling time of 5-8 days. We feel that leukotriene C4 and D4 could play an important role in post-inflammatory melanocyte hyperplasia.\r"

Although the composition of these alkanes strongly resembles petroleum waxes, it has been proposed that they are biosynthetic products of human skin. To investigate this question, skin surface lipids from 15 normal subjects were analyzed for the amount and composition of alkanes, using quantitative thin-layer chromatography and quartz capillary gas chromatography. The alkanes were found to constitute 0.5% to 1.7% of the skin lipids. Subjects differed greatly in the chain length distribution of their alkanes between 15 and 35 carbon atoms, and in the relative amounts of normal alkanes (like those in petroleum waxes) and branched chain alkanes (like those in petroleum lubricating oils). In 6 subjects, the alkane content of cerumen from each ear was examined to investigate whether alkanes arrive at the skin surface by a systemic route or by direct contact with environmental surfaces. No trace of alkanes was found in 11 of the 12 cerumen samples. Using a tandem accelerator mass spectrometer for carbon-14 dating, a combined sample of the skin surface alkanes was found to have a theoretical age of 30,950 years, similar to that of a sample of petrolatum. These analyses indicate that the alkanes found on the surface of human skin are mixtures of a variety of petroleum distillation fractions that are acquired by direct contamination from the environment.\r"

  ".W": "Dermatofibromas are frequently associated with acanthosis of the overlying epidermis. Using monospecific antisera and cRNA probes, we have examined the pattern of expression of keratin and keratin mRNA in the affected epidermis of patients with these dermal tumors. Our studies reveal several abnormalities in keratin expression within the thickened areas of overlying epidermis. In two of 15 patients, we detected K6 and K16, keratins which are frequently associated with epidermal diseases of hyperproliferation but are not present in normal epidermis. In both cases, K6 and K16 were found in suprabasal layers, similar to that seen for psoriasis and squamous cell carcinomas. Expression of K6 and K16 in skin samples from patients with dermatofibromas seemed to be dependent upon how near was the tumor to the overlying epidermis, and possibly upon the degree of cellularity within the tumor mass. A second aberration in keratin expression, and one which did not appear to be linked to K6/K16 expression, was the altered expression of the basal epidermal keratin K14. Expression of this keratin and its mRNA was variable, often extending into multiple suprabasal layers and including both basal-like and squamous-like cells. In contrast to the expression of K6/K16, aberrant expression of K14 was a relatively frequent event, occurring in greater than 70% of the dermatofibroma skin samples examined. These observations provide the first biochemical evidence in support of previous morphologic studies, indicating that alterations in epidermal differentiation can occur as a consequence of dermal skin tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The role of Langerhans cells (LC) in host resistance against the induction and growth of nonmelanoma skin cancers is still obscure. The purpose of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of LC to simulated solar radiation in patients with basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Thirty-four patients (31-74 years old) with at least one histologically diagnosed BCC on a sun-exposed area and 21 healthy volunteers (29-62 years old) were included in the study. Patients and control subjects were given 10 graded doses of simulated solar UV radiation (10-75 mJ/cm2) on the lower back using a 12S solar simulator with a WG 320 filter. Twenty-four hours later, the minimal erythema dose (MED) was determined and shave biopsies were taken from the site given 1.25 X MED and from adjacent, unirradiated skin. Epidermal sheets were stained for LC using the ATPase method. The mean value of the MED of the BCC patients was 25 +/- 2 mJ/cm2 and that of controls was 29 +/- 3 mJ/cm2 (p greater than 0.05). The number of ATPase+ LC was significantly decreased (p less than 0.05), and their morphology was altered in the irradiated skin of nearly all individuals. However, there was no significant difference in the average reduction of LC in the patients (32% +/- 3%) compared with that of control subjects (32% +/- 4%). The depletion of LC ranged from 0% to 74% in different individuals, all of whom were given 1.25 MED. Furthermore, no correlation was found between the percentage decrease in ATPase+ cells and the dose of UV radiation required to produce erythema. Our results indicate that the ability of UV radiation to cause erythema was unrelated to the magnitude of its effects on LC number or morphology. Second, the morphologic alterations of LC in BCC patients after UV irradiation do not differ from those observed in normal individuals. Third, as a group, patients with BCC do not have a significantly lower MED than cancer-free subjects.\r"

Three of these patients are also mothers of infants with the neonatal lupus erythematosus syndrome, characterized by cutaneous lesions resembling subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus or congenital heart block. Patients with Sjogren's/lupus erythematosus overlap syndrome, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and mothers of infants with the neonatal lupus syndrome characteristically have autoantibodies to Ro(SS-A), and in many cases, La(SS-B) antigens. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that anti-Ro(SS-A)/La(SS-B) positive Sjogren's/lupus overlap patients and mothers of infants with neonatal lupus erythematosus syndrome are immunogenetically homogenous and closely related. We report a strong association with HLA-B8, DR3, DQw2, and DRw52 phenotypes and the HLA-B8, DR3, DQw2, DRw52 extended haplotype in both patient cohorts. Furthermore, we describe disease associations with HLA-DR3/DRw6 heterozygotes in both patient groups. These data demonstrate that anti-Ro(SS-A)/La(SS-B) positive Sjogren's/lupus overlap patients and neonatal lupus syndrome mothers are immunogenetically closely related to each other and appear to be more closely related to both primary Sjogren's syndrome and subacute lupus erythematosus, than to classical systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the immunologic measurements from treatment of 12 healthy volunteers (six male, six female) with 800 and 1,600 mg cimetidine. In the first trial 800 mg cimetidine was administered daily to the volunteers over a period of 7 d; after an interruption of 2 months, 1,600 mg of cimetidine was applied daily for 21 d. The most striking result of our study was an increased mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (0.4 microgram/well) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) (0.4 microgram/well) induced lymphocyte proliferation were found to be significantly increased in comparison to pretreatment values on day 7 in both cimetidine regimens (800 mg; PHA: mean proliferation 66,500 before treatment to 166,00 cpm, PWM: mean proliferation 8,800 before treatment to 34,000 cpm; 1,600 mg; PHA; mean proliferation 48,700 before treatment to 81,600 cpm; PWM: mean proliferation 6,300 before treatment to 16,200 cpm). Increased mitogen-induced proliferation following cimetidine intake is of special interest because the mechanisms of this activation process are incompletely known. Lymphocyte proliferation response is dependent on the availability of extracellular calcium. The function of the other bivalent cations is unknown. We found that the extent of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation correlates with cellular intralymphocytic zinc and magnesium amounts (coefficients of correlation [r]) (800 mg: PHA/Mg r = 0.84; PHA/Zn r = 0.86; PWM/Mg r = 0.88; PWM/Zn r = 0.87). Though the application of both cimetidine doses causes enhanced mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation on day 7, T lymphocytes with different phenotypic properties appear to be influenced by cimetidine. In the first dose regimen (800 mg) the number of the CD8 lymphocytes decreased significantly from 16.1% (365 cell/microliters blood) to 12.7% (264 cells/microliters blood) after 7 d of cimetidine intake. After the period of high-dose (1,600 mg) cimetidine administration (at day 21) numbers of CD4 lymphocytes were significantly increased from 41.5% (860 cells/microliters blood) to 56.3% (1,210 cells/microliters blood). Our results show that although different cimetidine doses obviously influence different cell types of healthy volunteers, the cellular mechanisms are the same, namely, a proliferation and an increased incorporation of magnesium and zinc in lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "A highly differentiated porcine skin organ culture model has been developed for future investigations of membrane-coating granules (MCG) and their role in epidermal differentiation. In contrast to many previous systems, cultures do not undergo necrosis of the upper epidermis or display dermo-epidermal separation, but survive for at least 3 weeks, at which time mitotic cells are still evident. Although rete projections are gradually smoothed out and the viable epidermis thins at a rate of approximately 0.35 cells per day, the stratum corneum gains approximately 1.5 corneocytes per day. Furthermore, at 3 weeks all the major differentiation markers are expressed, including keratohyalin granules, MCG, and an orthokeratotic stratum corneum. The system is inexpensive, simple to establish, and does not require elevated oxygen levels. The main requirements are 1) the use of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2) hydrocortisone (100 micrograms/ml), 3) growth at an air/liquid interface, and 4) attached connective tissue. The further addition of vitamin C (300 micrograms/ml) and/or bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) offered no obvious advantage. Degeneration of organ cultures in standard cell culture media was discovered to be caused by fetal bovine serum (FBS). FBS-induced degeneration was not prevented by adding any of the supplements tested, or the inclusion of 3T3 fibroblasts, even when culturing at an air/liquid interface. Complete submersion rapidly killed specimens, presumably through oxygen starvation. The ability to maintain a fully keratinizing system for several weeks, in a totally chemically defined medium, will prove valuable for research not only into the role(s) of MCG in epidermal biology but also studies of desquamation and epidermal differentiation.\r"

The objective of this study was to assess the acute cutaneous enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant response to a single exposure of large fluence (300 mJ/cm2) ultraviolet radiation (greater than 280 nm) in hairless mice. This treatment caused an immediate and statistically significant inhibition of glutathione reductase and catalase activity. Glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were not affected. Glutathione levels decreased and, conversely glutathione disulfide concentrations increased. A slight depletion of the total glutathione was observed, while the content of total ascorbic acid did not change. The lipophilic antioxidants alpha-tocopherol, ubiquinol 9 and ubiquinone 9 also decreased significantly, and the concentration of malondialdehyde remained constant. The free radical scavenging activity of epidermis, as assessed by reduction of the stable, cationic nitroxide radical [2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinoxy-4-(2',4',6'-trimethyl) methylpyridinium perchlorate] was considerably inhibited. The study indicates that immediately after exposure to a large fluence of ultraviolet radiation the enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant capacity of skin decreases significantly.\r"

The permeability-enhancing effect of Azone increases with increasing Azone total concentrations until 0.1% is reached with mouse skin and 0.01% is reached for human epidermis. Thereafter, permeabilities for both tissues drop systematically. The maximally enhanced permeability in mouse skin approached that for mouse skin stripped of its stratum corneum. The peak permeability in human epidermis is an order of magnitude smaller than for mouse skin with the duration of Azone treatment required to achieve the full effect in human epidermis being twice that for mouse skin (approximately 20 h vs approximately 12 h). Thus, there is a profound difference in Azone's action on these two tissue types. It was also established that the affinity of an enhancer for a permeant drug can significantly offset its ability to enhance permeability. Specifically, hydrocortisone was found to partition significantly into the Azone-rich phase of the emulsion, lowering its concentration (and its thermodynamic activity) in the continuous aqueous phase and thereby reducing its flux through the skin. This physiochemical effect was profound enough to nullify the intrinsic permeability-enhancing effect of Azone as the total Azone concentration was raised to 10%.\r"

On immunoelectron microscopy, a mouse anti-rat macrophage monoclonal antibody, TRPM-1, recently produced by us, reacted with IC and some LC in adult rat skin. Ontogenic study revealed that TRPM-1-positive cells first appeared in the epidermis of fetal rat heads on Day 17 of gestation and then spread caudally along the anterior-posterior axis. On Day 20 of gestation, when the distribution of the TRPM-1-positive cells over body surface became even, Ia-positive cells appeared in the epidermis and began to increase in number. Ia-positive cells with Birbeck granules were found on Day 21 of gestation. These results indicate that. TRPM-1-positive IC matured into Ia-expressing LC after being exposed to microenvironmental change during the perinatal period. The number of Ia-positive cells exceeded that of TRPM-1-positive cells at around 5 d after birth. Afterwards, there were more dendritic Ia-positive cells found in the interfollicular areas than TRPM-1-positive ones. However, local concentrations of the TRPM-1-positive IC in the follicular infundibula were frequently found in the fetal stage and occasionally in adulthood. These TRPM-1-positive cells in the follicular infundibula were thought to be a precursor pool in the epidermis for LC.\r"

The maturation of the engrafted fetal skin was evaluated by assessing epidermal, dermal, and appendage development. Within the nude mouse, the HFS demonstrated progression in stratification and maturation of the epidermis. The dermis increased in depth, adding fibrovascular stroma and adipose tissue. The appendages demonstrated invagination, differentiation, and progression of organogenesis. Subcutaneously placed grafts showed the same rate of HFS development as HFS in utero. The grafts transplanted to the surface of the nude mice and exposed to air demonstrated an acceleration of development. We conclude that HFS transplanted to the nude mouse is an effective in vivo model for maintaining and altering HFS maturation.\r"

After 4 weeks, floating gels were 98% contracted, and attached gels were 94% contracted. During this culture period, fibroblasts in floating gels regressed significantly compared to fibroblasts in attached gels, although the cells remaining in the floating gels were viable. In attached gels, fibroblasts were bipolar; whereas in floating gels, fibroblasts were stellate. Therefore, differences between survival of fibroblasts in attached and floating collagen gels might depend on cell shape. Similarly, extracellular matrix organization and its influence on cell shape might control fibroblast proliferation in granulation tissue. During long-term culture of fibroblasts in contracted collagen gels, 70%-80% of the starting collagen was degraded. Collagen synthesized by cells in 4-d cultures was mostly procollagen secreted into the medium. On the other hand, collagen synthesized in 4-week cultures was processed to alpha (I) chains and incorporated into the matrix. There also were other differences between the proteins synthesized by fibroblasts after short-term and long-term culture in contracted gels. These findings show that fibroblasts in long-term collagen gel cultures express unique growth and biosynthetic characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "To study components of anionic sites on the lamina densa of the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) and to assess the effect of removal of sialic acid or glycosaminoglycans on its charge-selective permeability, epidermal sheets, whose dermis had been removed by treatment with dithiothreitol, were digested with heparitinase, chondroitinase ABC, hyaluronidase, or neuraminidase. They were then stained with polyethyleneimine for demonstration of the anionic sites or incubated in a medium containing native anionic ferritin for tracer experiments. The anionic sites were completely removed after heparitinase digestion. Although the numerical density of the sites was not altered, their electron density was decreased after chondroitinase ABC digestion. The other enzymes had no effect on the sites. In the tracer experiments, heparitinase or neuraminidase increased the number of tracer molecules penetrating into the lamina lucida of the epidermal sheet, while the other enzymes had no effect on it. These data indicate that heparan sulfate, which is a main component of the anionic sites, plays an important role in the charge-selective permeability of the DEJ, whereas chondroitin sulfate, which seems to be contained in the sites, does not, probably because of its small amount. These data also indicate that sialic acid, which is not a main component of the anionic sites demonstrated with the cationic probe, has a role in the permeability function.\r"

RAR-beta mRNA was expressed in skin, but patterns of expression differed between human and neonatal rat samples. In human dermal fibroblasts, keratinocytes and whole skin, two RAR-beta transcripts (ca. 3.1 and 3.4 kb) were expressed. Conversely, in neonatal rat skin, dermal fibroblasts, and keratinocytes only the smaller transcript was detectable and was more abundant in cultured cells than in whole tissue.

Also the effect of ceftriaxone on CSF endotoxin levels was investigated in eight patients by reexamining their CSF 2-6 h after the initial dose. Initial CSF bacterial density correlated with initial CSF endotoxin levels (P less than .001). Ceftriaxone induced a marked increase of free endotoxin in CSF, from an initial (mean +/- SE) 0.75 +/- 0.21 to 1.29 +/- 0.23 log10 ng/ml (P less than .01). This increase correlated positively with the number of bacteria killed in the CSF (P less than .01). The increase in free endotoxin was associated with an increase in mean CSF lactate levels from 8.5 to 9.7 units/l (P less than .05) and mean lactate dehydrogenase levels from 102 to 180 mmol/l (P less than .02) and a decrease in mean CSF glucose from 1.17 to 0.46 mmol/l (P less than .05). Initial CSF total endotoxin concentrations correlated both with the Herson-Todd clinical severity score (P less than .001) and with the number of febrile hospital days (P less than .001). These findings suggest that highly bactericidal agents initially lead to release of free endotoxin from gram-negative organisms into CSF, with associated enhanced inflammatory response by the host.\r"

The PCR assay developed from this sequence reacted with 17 of 18 strains of B. burgdorferi but not with any other Borrelia species tested. The assay was sensitive to fewer than five copies of the B. burgdorferi genome, even in the presence of a 10(6)-fold excess of eukaryotic DNA. This assay should greatly facilitate the accurate diagnosis of Lyme disease and provide a means with which to investigate the pathogenesis, transmission, and basic biology of B. burgdorferi.\r"

Genetic analysis revealed that 98% of the 45 patients with AIDS harbored only M. avium regardless of the anatomic or geographic source of the isolate; in contrast, approximately 40% of MAC isolates recovered from 109 patients without AIDS were M. intracellulare. Most M. intracellulare of respiratory origin recovered from patients without AIDS were involved in infectious processes. When 95 MAC isolates (M. avium, n = 53; M. intracellulare, n = 42) were evaluated for in vitro susceptibility to primary or secondary antimycobacterial drugs, significant differences were noted. M. intracellulare was more susceptible to streptomycin, rifampin, and ethambutol than M. avium; the converse was true for ethionamide. The results of this study suggest potentially important differences in disease spectrum and in vitro susceptibility profile for M. avium and M. intracellulare.\r"

This investigation studied the influence of magnesium concentration on production of total exoprotein and beta-lactamase by strains of S. aureus and Staphylococcus hemolyticus, isolated from the genital tracts of women. These strains were resistant to penicillins. Each organism was incubated in chemically defined medium with various concentrations of magnesium, and total exoprotein production and beta-lactamase activity in supernatants were determined. In all strains, total exoprotein production and beta-lactamase activity per bacterial cell were markedly increased in the presence of low concentrations of magnesium. When the concentration of magnesium was elevated, production of total exoprotein and beta-lactamase was decreased. Therefore, magnesium-deficient strains of S. aureus and S. hemolyticus may secrete more exoproteins and be more resistant to beta-lactam drugs than when magnesium is not limiting.\r"

Activity is increased by thiol-activating agents and inhibited by thiol proteinase inhibitors. About 55% of activity remains in the soluble fraction after high-speed centrifugation, and pretreatment with a nonionic detergent results in increased soluble activity. This suggests that the enzyme is membrane bound or associated with subcellular particles. Activity elutes as a major peak at 38,000 molecular weight by calibrated sieve chromatography. The favored sites of enzymatic cleavage of IgA1 are between the CH2 and CH3 domain and near the hinge region of the heavy chain. Similar cleavage patterns were identified using sonicated preparations of Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis.\r"

Antibody responses were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Individual glycoproteins induced VZV-specific proliferation by mononuclear cells from 15 of 20 immune subjects. Serologic responses to the VZV glycoproteins occurred in 16 of 20 immune subjects. Of note, gpII served as a potent T and B cell antigen during both acute infection and convalescence. Cell-mediated responses to the glycoprotein antigens represented proliferation by T lymphocytes and required antigen presentation by adherent mononuclear cells. These findings indicate that virally encoded glycoproteins contain epitopes that stimulate VZV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses.\r"

Of the cases, 110 (27%) were nosocomial; the other 291 patients had community acquired infection. The highest attack rates of EKC occurred in patients attending specialty clinics; the overall attack rate among clinic patients was 4.7/1,000 clinic visits. All nosocomial cases were caused by adenovirus type 8; community acquired cases were a mixture of adenovirus types 8 and 37. Adenoviruses were isolated from conjunctival cultures up to 14 d after the onset of clinical illness. Initial efforts to prevent nosocomial transmission were unsuccessful. However, when a plan to triage all patients on entry to the infirmary and to sort patients and personnel caring for infected patients into cohorts was implemented, nosocomial transmission of EKC was promptly and effectively halted, despite the continuation of the community epidemic for another 4 mo. This outbreak clearly demonstrates the efficacy of rigorous infection control in preventing nosocomial transmission of adenovirus EKC.\r"

Further, the complementary RNA species as replication templates of HDV genomes documented in previous animal studies were confirmed. Within the livers of four HBsAg carriers, the transcription of HBV was absent or incomplete, however, in the patient without HDV RNA, the HBV genes expressed accurately and actively.

  ".W": "In 1987 an epidemic of diarrhea associated with adult diarrhea rotavirus (ADRV) occurred in Qinhuangdao City, China, affecting more than 200 persons and causing 2 deaths. The outbreak was introduced by a person returning from an epidemic area and was spread initially to his family members and subsequently to the entire community. Adults were at greater risk of diarrhea than children 0-4 y of age and, the duration of illness increased significantly with increasing age. ADRV was identified by ELISA and electron microscopy. The electropherotypes of all positive specimens were identical, consistent with the single point-source introduction of the virus. Seroconversion was detected in 6 of 7 ill persons with a blocking ELISA. Both asymptomatic infection and person-to-person spread identified in this epidemic suggest that current emphasis on preventing waterborne transmission may not control the introduction of ADRV into new areas. The predisposition of adults for more severe disease with ADRV is similar to the pattern observed with other enteric viruses such as the Norwalk agent and hepatitis A.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the immunogenicity of purified recombinant envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 (rgp120) as a potential vaccine for AIDS, the antibody response of 45 baboons to rgp120 was investigated using an adjuvant (alum) and route of administration (intramuscular) suitable for humans. The primary purpose was to evaluate the effects of different doses and immunization schedules on the antibody response to rgp120 in primates. A secondary objective was to evaluate possible adverse consequences of rgp120 immunization. A liquid-phase radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay for detection of rgp120-reactive antibodies revealed that rgp120 doses of 30-300 micrograms per administration resulted in nearly indistinguishable serum antibody responses. However, significant enhancement of serum antibody titers was observed when the interval between the second and third administrations was increased from 4 to 20 w. Although changing the interval significantly altered the magnitude of resulting peak titers, the kinetics of antibody formation were not changed. Thus, of the three schedules of immunization tested, none resulted in a sustained humoral immune response. The significance of the RIP assay for evaluating immune responses was confirmed by analysis showing that the percentage of immunized baboons that developed in vitro HIV-1 serum neutralizing responses was greatest in groups that also exhibited high anti-rgp120 RIP titers. Immunization with rgp120 had no significant adverse effect on any clinical or laboratory parameter monitored over the course of the study.\r"

Twelve percent of respondents reported diarrhea; the risk of diarrhea was significantly higher in those who ate raw or cooked oysters (relative risk = 1.5, P = .005). At least one Vibrio species was recovered from 51 (11%) of 479 persons submitting stool specimens; however, only 15 (29%) of those with a positive stool culture also reported diarrhea. Of the five Vibrio species identified, V. parahaemolyticus was most common and was most strongly associated with diarrhea. V. cholerae serogroup O1 was not isolated despite the occurrence of a cholera outbreak during the same time period in Louisiana. Cultures of raw and cooked seafood served in local restaurants yielded five different Vibrio species. Although asymptomatic passage of Vibrio organisms was common among persons eating seafood, the risk of Vibrio gastroenteritis was low.\r"

Microbiologic techniques included the use of thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose (TCBS) medium on all stool specimens. Among 40 vibrio isolates from 32 patients, eight species were identified: V. parahaemolyticus (16), V. vulnificus (10), non-O1 V. cholerae (7), V. mimicus (3), V. hollisae (1), V. fluvialis (1), V. alginolyticus (1), and an unnamed halophilic vibrio. Sources included stool (13), wound (11), sputum (3), ear (3), bone (1), and gallbladder (1). While illnesses were diverse, they were relatively mild and self-limited with no mortality. The mild clinical spectrum and especially lack of mortality are in sharp contrast to the findings of previous reports. Even with the proximity to the bay and use of optimal isolation techniques, the demonstrated incidence of vibrio infections was low (1.6/100,000/y). The routine use of TCBS medium, which has been advocated for high-risk areas, was not cost-effective.\r"

Bactericidal antibody was detected in acute serum of 26% of the subjects at a mean titer of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (log2) and was observed in convalescent serum of all of the individuals at a mean titer of 4.0 +/- 0.3 (log2, P less than .001). The serum bactericidal antibody response was not age-dependent (r = .08, P greater than .05). Serum concentrations of bactericidal antibody remained stable for the entire observation period in 90% of the children. The presence of serum bactericidal antibody correlated significantly with a reduction in the number of bacteria present in the middle ear fluid (P less than .025). Eight children experienced a second episode of otitis media with effusion caused by a different serotype of NTHI. All those who lacked bactericidal antibody against the organism causing the second episode possessed bactericidal antibody against the first strain at the time of the second episode. These data suggest that the immune response to NTHI in otitis media with effusion is type-specific. The occurrence of second episodes of otitis media with effusion due to different strains of NTHI in the face of preexisting heterologous bactericidal antibody suggests a lack of NTHI in the face of preexisting heterologous bactericidal antibody suggests a lack of cross-protection.\r"

Successive serum samples from children followed prospectively for three years from birth were analysed for IgG antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses and influenza A virus. Values from serum antibody activity gradually decreased during the first six months of life, followed by a gradual increase. Various relationships were found to obtain between age and the increases of antibody activity against the different viruses. Thus, three quarters of those tested had manifested increased antibody activity against RSV by 18 months of age, and against adenoviruses by 30 months of age. No increase of antibody activity against influenza A was noted before 12 months of age, and then only seen in two thirds of those tested during the entire three-year observation period. With regard to age, however, the proportion of children with increased antibody activity to RSV, adenoviruses or influenza A virus did not differ between otitis-prone and non-otitis-prone children. Thus, as compared to non-otitis-prone children, development of the ability to produce antibodies against these viruses was not found to be delayed in otitis-prone children.\r"

Five hundred estimations of (objective) nasal resistance to airflow and (subjective) nasal sensation of airflow where carried out. No correlation could be demonstrated between these two parameters. It is concluded nasal resistance to airflow and nasal sensation of airflow are two separate modalities which are not directly related. The possible reasons for this finding are discussed with reference to previous work on nasal sensation.\r"

Facial paresis is the usual presenting feature of a facial schwannoma, while deafness, ageusia and reduced lacrimation are variable, dependent upon the site of the lesion.

The pathogenesis, differential diagnosis and management of the condition are discussed.\r"

Cephalometric studies have established that the majority of Pakistanis are brachio to ultra-brachiocephalic (Cephalic Index 82-x). Radiological evaluation of normal mastoids and their planimetric measurements show that the mastoid process is smaller (Av: 10.24 sq.cm. +/- 0.8) than the Caucasian Western races (Av: 12-15 sq.cm.). Neither combined approach tympanoplasty, nor mastoid obliteration technique may be required, nor technically possible in a small mastoid. Natural epithelization of a small 'peanut size' mastoidectomy cavity does not justify these procedures. A modified radical mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty reconstruction provides a satisfactory result in chronic discharging ears.\r"

All patients who did not have normal auditory brainstem responses proceeded to high resolution CT scanning. One hundred and fifteen patients were investigated and four acoustic neuromas were diagnosed. The efficiency of these tests in a general ORL clinic is very much poorer than often suggested, due largely to the number of occasions on which the tests cannot be done, and to the very small proportion of the test population who have CPA tumours.\r"

Abnormalities in the contralateral ABR were analysed and five patients had abnormal III-V interwave intervals, in seven patients the I-III intervals were abnormal and in one patient, only the fifth wave was present and of abnormal latency. The tumour size was assessed by computed axial tomography (CT) and the relationship between tumour size and contralateral ABR findings established. Large tumours (greater than 2.5 cm.) were associated with contralateral ABR abnormalities in 25.6 per cent of the patients, medium tumours (1.0-2.5 cm.) with ABR abnormalities in 14 per cent and there were no abnormalities in the small group (intracanalicular). The implications for interpretation of ABR recordings contralateral to an acoustic neuroma are discussed in relation to brainstem compression and its effect on the wave generator sites.\r"

The laryngoscopic appearances often simulated malignancy. Most patients (69.2 per cent) had lesions involving the anterior two-thirds of the true vocal cords. Hypertrophic lesions (69.2 per cent) out-numbered ulcerative ones (38.5 per cent). Laryngeal oedema was infrequent (7.7 per cent). Diagnosis was based on a laryngeal biopsy in 18 patients and on evidence of associated pulmonary tuberculosis and response to anti-tuberculous therapy in eight. Chest X-rays showed apical cavitation and infiltration as the commonest findings. Three patients had miliary tuberculosis and one had no pulmonary lesion. Diabetes mellitus was present in seven (26.9 per cent) patients. Four illustrative cases are described. The problems in diagnosis and management of laryngeal tuberculosis are discussed.\r"

On the basis of these tests, the present article reveals from a forensic anthropology angle the related regular patterns of plane projection of the human face with its skull. Study shows that there exist a strict individual identity and exclusiveness in relation between the human face and skull. The related regularity of displacement of face landmarks appears in projection of the skull with the human head at different photographic positions and angles. On the basis of this discovery, 52 indexes in 4 groups were established as a standard for judging the identification of a skull's body origin by means of skull-image superimposition. Based on forensic anthropology, the technique has raised to a great extent the credibility of unknown skull identification. In the past 8 years, 89 unknown skulls have been identified with their body origins which provided important and accurate evidence for the solution of murders with dismembered bodies, skeletonized bodies, and unidentified dead bodies.\r"

Since the presence and extent of restorations are important data for forensic science identification purposes, the Computer-Assisted Postmortem Identification (CAPMI) system was used to assess the practical effect of the decreased selectivity expected as a result of improved dental health. Dental examination data from 7030 soldiers were recorded on optical mark read forms and entered into a database. The data were reorganized and analyzed to generate summary statistics about the incidence of each type of restoration (divided into 16 categories) for both anterior, posterior, upper, lower, and combined segments. Patients' ages ranged from 17 to 49 with a mean of 24 years 5 months. Sixty percent were from 18 to 25 years old. A characteristic is defined as any situation other than a virgin tooth; for example, extracted, missing, unerupted, or restored. The average subject had 7 dental characteristics with approximately 75% having 4 or more. Within the entire population, 9% had 32 unrestored teeth. 3.6% had only one characteristic. To test the selectivity and uniqueness of various combinations of dental characteristics, 363 simulations using the CAPMI system were made against the entire 7030 subject database. Sample records (33 per group) with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-18, and 19+ characteristics were chosen at random from the database and searches were made.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the six patients who died within 24 h of the onset of symptoms, two died of obstruction of a valve orifice, two died of sepsis, one died of sepsis and alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and one died of a coronary artery embolus. Of the five patients with symptoms lasting more than 24 h, three died of sepsis and congestive heart failure. One died from sepsis alone and one died from congestive heart failure (CHF). In two patients whose duration of symptoms is unknown, one died of sepsis and CHF, and in the other the mechanism of death is unknown. Predisposing factors present in 11 of 13 patients included alcoholism (three), intravenous (IV) drug abuse (three), prosthetic valves (three), aortic stenosis (two), past rheumatic fever (one), and nonstenotic congenitally bicuspid valves (two). The reasons for no antemortem diagnosis were a missed or incorrect clinical diagnosis in three patients seen by a physician shortly before death, no signs or symptoms or found dead (four), non-specific signs and symptoms (three), refusal of medical treatment (one), and a solitary lifestyle (one); there was insufficient information about one patient. Individuals with needle tracks, generalized petechiae. Osler's nodes, splinter hemorrhages, intravenous catheters, pacemaker wires, and infected aortic-valve (A-V) shunts are at risk of IE. Blood and the vegetations should be cultured. The attending physician should be notified of the diagnosis in such cases.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump therapy on patients' activities of daily living and the prevalence of acute complications were examined in order to characterize patients' experience while on CSII, and to ascertain whether any of these factors could be associated with continued use of CSII. Fifty-one of 55 patients (93%) identified as initiating CSII in our medical center patient population completed retrospective surveys; 37 individuals (73%) were still using pumps and 14 individuals (27%) had discontinued pump use. CSII appeared to affect the quality of daily activities only modestly, neither improving nor interfering with many activities to any great degree. Activities associated with greatest improvements were eating, working, traveling, sleeping, and exercising. Results of logit analyses adjusting for duration of pump therapy indicated that the prevalence of six different acute complications (skin infections at the needle site, mild insulin reactions, more severe insulin reactions requiring assistance, hypoglycemic coma, asymptomatic hypoglycemia, and ketoacidosis) was not statistically associated with patients' decisions to continue or to stop CSII. In contrast, significant differences (p less than 0.05) between the groups continuing and discontinuing CSII were found in 11 of 18 activities of daily living. In general, patients continuing CSII, in contrast to those discontinuing CSII, found that many of their activities were improved significantly during pump therapy. There were few differences between groups in the degree to which CSII was perceived to interfere with daily activities. However, those continuing CSII found it significantly less necessary to take the pump off while doing some activities than did those discontinuing CSII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The proportion of overweight persons unaware of their condition was related to age, smoking habit, education and physical activity. In men with hypertension, the proportion of subjects unaware of being overweight was smaller by 25% compared with others. This was not the case in women. A history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dyspnea or poor health status had no effect on the awareness of being overweight.\r"

We propose a conceptual framework that encompasses all health-related research and demonstrates the relationships and interfaces between the various disciplines involved. The framework emerges from a classification of health-related research into studies of health states or health interventions followed by consideration of the level of analysis (e.g. cell, individual, community) employed and the purpose of each study (development, description, explanation, or evaluation).\r"

The Stanford Physical Activity Recall, the Caltrac Activity Monitor, and a daily physical activity log were administered to 45 subjects over a 3-week period. The results indicated high levels of test-retest reliability for the Stanford and the daily log; low test-retest reliability was obtained for the Caltrac. Convergent validity was also high between the Stanford and daily log but was low for both of these measures with the Caltrac. These results suggest that the Stanford Physical Activity Recall may be the self-report measure of choice for large studies due to its high reliability and convergent validity with a more time-consuming daily log, as well as its cost- and time-efficiency. Based on the results, it is recommended that the Caltrac activity sensors not be used for field studies of physical activity until the logistical problems of their use in clinical trials are solved.\r"

Hospital of birth medical records were abstracted for these children. Mean birth weights, risks of LBW, LBW occurring with preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks) (LBW/p), and LBW in term infants (LBW/t) were examined in successive singleton siblings according to LBW status of prior siblings. The risk of LBW in infants who had prior siblings with LBW was 9.9%, compared with a risk of 2.8% in infants who had prior siblings without LBW (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 2.0-7.3). The excess recurrence of LBW was specifically due to LBW/p. Infants with prior siblings with LBW/p were at high tisk of LBW/p (OR = 9.2, CI 4.4-19.6) but not of LBW/t (OR = 2.0, CI 0.1-9.1). Using modified logistic regression techniques that incorporate familial risks and the effects of other risk factors, the excess sibling recurrence risk of LBW and LBW/p could not be explained by the tendency for recurrence in siblings of other risk factors for LBW, such as pregnancy complications, maternal illnesses, and birth defects. Although the familial factors involved in LBW may or may not be genetic in nature, such factors need to be investigated in epidemiologic studies of LBW and prematurity.\r"

Nonetheless, this assumption is often implicitly made. We will use both clinical reasoning and a simple model to show how non-constancy of the hazard function affects odds ratio interpretation. When the hazard function is non-constant and there is more than one temporal pattern of drug usage, the odds ratio will estimate a weighted mean of incidence ratios with weights dependent on the corresponding fractions of person-time. If the duration-specific incidence ratios differ widely, the odds ratio will depend not only on the drug but also on its usage pattern in the study population. This may explain some of the large regional odds ratio variation for dipyrone-related agranulocytosis in the International Agranulocytosis and Aplastic Anemia Study (JAMA 1986; 256: 1749-1757.\r"

The extent to which risk adjustments using claims can be improved by adding information from one well-known measure based on chart review and patient examination (the American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) Physical Status score) is also examined. Readmissions and mortality after three common surgical procedures are the outcomes studied using multiple logistic regression. Claims-based measures of comorbidity, derived both from hospital discharge abstracts at the time of surgery and from hospitalizations in the 6 months before surgery, provided reasonably good predictions of postsurgical readmissions and mortality. In the most complete logistic regression models, the Somers' Dyx measure of fit (a rank correlation coefficient) ranged from 0.23 to 0.38 for readmissions and from 0.46 to 0.72 for mortality. In 5 out of 6 cases, these predictions were not improved by including the prospectively-collected ASA Physical Status score. Such difficulties in improving risk adjustment by more intensive data collection are discussed in terms of their research implications.\r"

The strength of agreement between the two data sources (as measured by kappa statistics) was substantial kappa greater than 0.6) for splenectomy, appendectomy, asthma, and systemic lupus erythematosus; moderate kappa greater than 0.4) for tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, tuberculosis, diverticulitis, hepatitis, rheumatic fever, and drug allergy; and poor kappa less than 0.3) for chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and most other types of allergy. In general, self respondents had more accurate recall than surrogate respondents. Among self respondents the strength of agreement tended to be greater for males than females, for whites than blacks, and for subjects from referral hospitals than for community hospitals. No consistent patterns were apparent by age. Despite a number of limitations, the findings of the study provide an addition to the scant epidemiologic literature on this topic, and suggest that for certain conditions medical record data collection may be needed to supplement interview information.\r"

In later middle age, low forced vital capacity, presence of intermittent claudication, cerebrovascular disease or coronary heart disease and higher age were the most powerful predictors for disability 10 years later. In order to lower disability in old age, it is important to prevent deterioration of ventilatory function and cardiovascular diseases in middle-aged populations and to treat chronic diseases adequately.\r"

The causes of nulliparity related to female sterility or subfertility (mechanical or hormonal disorders) were not found to be associated with a significantly higher risk of breast cancer. The causes related to fertilization failure, i.e. no sexual partner, rare sexual intercourse (less than once per month), or partner with abnormal semen, were found to lead to an increased risk. Detailed analysis of contraceptive methods showed that the risk of breast cancer increased (p = 0.02) with a longer duration of use of barrier methods (withdrawal or condom). Conversely, the risk significantly decreased (p = 0.004) with a longer duration of use of non-barrier methods (oral contraceptives, IUD, cap, local spermicides, vaginal douche, safe period, or no method), i.e. methods allowing a direct exposure to human semen.\r"

A total of 30 patients were enrolled; all were evaluable. 5FU was administered as a loading course, 750 mg/m2 daily for 5 days by continuous infusion followed by weekly bolus therapy, rIFN alpha-2a, 9 MU, was administered subcutaneously three times per week. Of 17 previously untreated patients evaluable for response, 13 achieved a response. Three patients had disease progression. No previously treated patients had a major response. There was one death clearly related to therapy, an event preceded by watery diarrhea and neutropenic sepsis. Other toxicities were reversible and responded to dose reduction. With a median follow-up of 16+ months, median survival has not been reached among the previously untreated patient cohort. We conclude that the combination of 5FU and rIFN alpha-2a is an active regimen against disseminated colorectal cancer in previously untreated patients.\r"

In both groups of patients, the fraction of the total dose of mechlorethamine delivered in all cycles divided by the planned dose for six cycles was strongly associated with OS (P = .002 for patients receiving initial MOPP and P = .02 for the salvage group, respectively). B symptoms were independent of drug-derived variables associated with OS (corresponding P values .03 for initial MOPP and .004 for the salvage group). The predictive value of mechlorethamine dosage with regard to OS was retained in an analysis restricted to the patients receiving greater than or equal to six cycles of chemotherapy. In the initial chemotherapy group, mechlorethamine dosage was associated with attainment of CR but none of the variables tested was predictive of DFS. In the salvage chemotherapy group, mechlorethamine dosage was associated with attainment of CR and duration of DFS as well. The results emphasize that, besides tumor characteristics, optimal dosage of chemotherapy is of great importance for survival.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a prospective study of the clinical significance of immunophenotype in 110 patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated by oncologists in the Nebraska Lymphoma Study Group between October 1982 and May 1986. All patients were immunophenotyped from biopsies performed before therapy was administered. The patients were treated with a uniform protocol of radiotherapy for minimal nonbulky, stage I or II disease (seven patients) or a single, six-drug chemotherapy regimen cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, procarbazine, bleomycin, vincristine, and prednisone (CAP-BOP) in patients with more extensive disease (103 patients). Ninety-one patients (83%) had B-cell lymphoma and 19 patients (17%) had T-cell lymphoma. The histologic diagnosis of diffuse mixed-cell lymphoma was significantly associated with T-cell immunophenotype (45% v 5%; P less than .001), and the diagnosis of diffuse large-cell lymphoma was significantly associated with B-cell immunophenotype (40% v 5%; P = .006). However, no significant difference in frequency of prognostic variables such as age, stage, systemic symptoms, tumor bulk, serum lactic dehydrogenase, or performance status was found between the B-cell and T-cell groups. Patients with B-cell NHL had a slightly higher complete remission rate (74% v 53%; P = NS), similar durability of complete remission (75% v 70% at 3 years; P = NS), and a slightly but not significantly better overall survival (50% v 41% at 3 years; P = NS). The slight advantage in response rate and survival for B-cell patients was related to a very poor outcome for patients with stage IV T-cell NHL. For patients with stage I to III disease, neither the complete remission rate (B-cell, 82% v T-cell, 91%; P = NS) nor overall survival (3-year survival for B cell, 58% v T cell, 73%; P = NS) were significantly different. However, with stage IV disease B-cell patients fared far better than those with T-cell NHL for both complete remission rate (67% v 0%; P = .002) and overall survival (3-year survival, 44% v 0%; P = .002). Immunophenotyping intermediate- and high-grade NHL allowed identification of a subgroup of patients who had a very poor prognosis with this treatment approach and for whom alternate therapy might be considered.\r"

  ".U": "90063656\r", 
  ".W": "We observed increased gallium-67 uptake in the mediastinum after completion of chemotherapy in 10 of 62 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. All 10 were under 15 years of age, yielding a frequency of 43% in this age group. The interval between cessation of chemotherapy and the development of increased gallium-67 uptake ranged from 1 to 8 months, and the abnormality persisted for 2 to 59 months. Serial chest x-rays were performed in all patients, and four of the 10 had transient widening of the mediastinum that remained within normal limits for the children's ages. Three patients had chest computed tomographic (CT) scans at the time of increased gallium-67 uptake, and one of the three had serial scans that showed a mediastinal mass consistent with thymic enlargement. All of the patients were asymptomatic and none were biopsied. All 10 remained well, with a mean follow-up of 52.5 months. The phenomenon we describe is probably due to \"rebound\" thymic hyperplasia, which is a benign and transient condition. We conclude that abnormal mediastinal gallium-67 uptake after completion of chemotherapy is likely to be benign and transient if the patients are young, have small non-cleaved-cell histology, are without other evidence of lymphoma recurrence, and do not have initial mediastinal involvement. Progressive widening of the mediastinum on chest x-ray is cause for suspicion and requires further evaluation. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels may not be helpful in differentiating a benign from a malignant process.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) are the major cytotoxic metabolites of mercaptopurine (6-MP). Red blood cell (RBC) 6-TGN concentrations were measured in a group of 120 consecutive children with lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to assess interpatient variability and its clinical importance. Assays were performed after at least 2 months 6-MP maintanance chemotherapy and a minimum 7 days unattenuated protocol dose of 75 mg/m2. Observed 6-TGN concentrations ranged from 126 to 832 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBCs (median, 275). There was a correlation between 6-TGN and neutropenia 14 days postassay (rs = .51; P less than .0005), and an inverse correlation between 6-TGN and the length of time uninterrupted full protocol dose was tolerated without neutropenia (rs = -.3; P less than .01). After a median follow-up of 49 months, 19 children had relapsed, of whom 17 (89%) had 6-TGN concentrations below the group median (log-rank chi 2 = 11.9; P less than .001). Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards regression showed the 6-TGN effect on disease control to be independent of diagnostic WBC count, sex, age, immunological cell type, French-American-British (FAB) type, variation in other antineoplastic therapy, and duration of remission at the time of 6-TGN assay. Children with ALL taking the same dose of 6-MP show great variability in its measurable cytotoxic effect, and this variability is apparently important in predicting treatment outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Many small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) produce gastrin-releasing peptides (GRPs) (mammalian bombesin) but the plasma concentration of GRP is rarely elevated, possibly because of its rapid elimination. We developed a radioimmunoassay for the C-terminal flanking peptide of proGRP and measured its concentration in plasma from 71 patients with SCLC, in 27 healthy subjects and in 49 patients with other diseases including lung carcinomas. In addition, we studied the molecular size of immunoreactive C-flanking peptide in two SCLC cell lines and in plasma from SCLC patients. The concentration of immunoreactive C-flanking peptide in normal subjects and in control patients did not exceed 10 pmol/L and 26 pmol/L, whereas 72% of the SCLC patients had C-flanking peptide concentrations above 10 pmol/L. In patients with extensive disease (n = 35) the median concentration was 71 pmol/L (range, 10 to 940). ProGRP C-flanking peptide levels paralleled the clinical course in 12 patients. The molecule(s) responsible for the immunoreactivity had a molecular size of about 8 to 10 kd in both patient plasma and tumor cell lines, suggesting that the measured peptide(s) represented major fragment(s) if not the entire C-flanking peptide of proGRP. Thus this peptide(s) seems to be a useful marker for SCLC.\r"

The univariate analysis selected the following variables: performance status, renal function, percentage of bone marrow plasma cells at diagnosis, hemoglobin, and age. A multivariate analysis showed that performance status, renal function, percentage of bone marrow plasma cells, hemoglobin, and age were the best predictive variables for survival. A score was assigned to each patient according to these variables, which led to their classification in three groups: good, intermediate, and poor risk, with a probability of survival of 26% and 10% at 96 months, and 5% at 56 months, and median survival of 60, 37, and 14 months, respectively (P = .0000). In our patient population, this model proved to be superior to the Durie-Salmon staging system in defining prognostic risk groups, and separating patients with significantly different risks within each Durie-Salmon stage.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based immunotherapy is associated with profound reversible cholestasis and hyperbilirubinemia. We performed a nonrandomized retrospective and prospective analysis to determine the incidence, characteristics, clinical course, and nature of the IL-2-induced liver dysfunction in patients with cancer. Patients received IL-2 at a dose of 20,000 to 100,000 units (U)/kg thrice daily for up to 5 days. Fifty-one patients on adjuvant treatment protocols received a mean of 10.18 +/- 2.38 IL-2 doses and 11.67 +/- 4.16 doses were delivered to 210 patients with advanced disease during this period. Retrospective analysis of all patients receiving this therapy revealed increases in the following liver function tests expressed as median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile (range): bilirubin (mg/dL) 4.5, 2.6, 6.5 (.4 to 38.5); alkaline phosphatase (U/L) 256, 179, 378 (56-1680); SGOT (U/L) 80, 52, 117 (18 to 483); SGPT (U/L) 91, 64, 132 (20-540); prothrombin time 13.4, 12.8, 14.5 (10.8 to 35.4); and albumin (g/dL) values decreased (trough) slightly 3.0, 2.8, 3.2 (2.3 to 3.8). Multiple regression analysis revealed several factors that were significantly associated with the increase in bilirubin when jointly considered (model P2 less than or equal to .001) including total IL-2 dosage, increase in creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, weight, and SGOT. Similar increases were noted in a prospectively evaluated group of 10 patients. A return to normal levels of bilirubin was noted within 5.6 days of stopping IL-2. Fasting serum cholylglycine increased from a mean of 32.3 +/- 1.6 to a peak of 1556.0 +/- 625.0 mg/mL. Although conventional ultrasound examinations were unrevealing, tissue ultrasound examinations revealed a mean scatterer spacing (MSS) increase compared to baseline of .10 +/- .04 (P less than .02) suggesting hepatic edema or an infiltrative process. Further, computerized hepatobiliary nuclear medicine scans revealed a delay in uptake (2.2 +/- 0.5 fold greater) and excretion (8.0 +/- 5.9 fold greater) of technetium-99m labeled disofenin. These findings support the development of profound reversible cholestasis as the primary basis for the elevated bilirubin in patients undergoing IL-2 treatment and may have implications for understanding the jaundice observed in some patients postoperatively as well as that associated with sepsis and other inflammatory disorders. Specifically, the release of IL-2 or the induction of other factors similarly induced by IL-2 may be responsible for these findings. Tissue ultrasound and computerized hepatobiliary scans provide additional noninvasive assessments of liver function and physiology.\r"

Patient survival was also examined. The first 15 consecutive patients were enrolled in protocol A without an IL2 priming phase and the following 25 patients were entered in protocol B where a 5-day priming phase was initiated before leukapheresis. A maintenance regimen consisted of either 3 x 10(6) units of recombinant interferon-alpha (rIFN-alpha), three times per week only or together with leukapheresis and infusion of IO4-/IL2-activated cells and 2 days of continuous infusion IL2 per month. Thirty-four patients completed the protocol treatment. Four patients were removed from the study owing to rapid tumor progression and two patients died while receiving treatment. The clinical response rate was 22%: two patients had a complete response and five patients had a partial response. Among the 25 patients who had no clinical response, 11 patients had either a mixed response or stabilization. Neither response, response duration, nor site response correlated with the total dose of IL2 administered or the number of activated killer cells infused. Patients who received maintenance therapy had longer survival times than patients who did not receive such therapy. All toxicity and side effects associated with IL2 treatment were transient and resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Patients on maintenance therapy tolerated both rIFN-alpha and monthly infusions of activated killer cells and IL2 well. This study confirms the concept of adoptive immunotherapy as a new treatment approach for advanced renal cell carcinoma and suggests that maintenance therapy may prolong survival time.\r"

We have taken advantage of recent advances in pump technology and developed a system in which patients with severe pain received a continuous narcotic infusion, along with the capability of PCA bolus for breakthrough pain. All patients were experiencing chronic pain related to cancer and were unable to obtain adequate pain control with either intermittent parenteral, oral, or rectal narcotics. Sixty-nine percent of patients were treated in the home setting, and the majority received morphine sulfate subcutaneously (SQ). Admixture stability studies using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that dexamethasone, metoclopramide, and haloperidol could be added to the morphine solutions and remain stable for 1 week at room temperature. Of 117 patients entered, 95% received excellent pain control, and side effects were rare, consisting of subcutaneous needle site infection and respiratory depression. Progressive pain due to either advancing disease or development of drug tolerance could be controlled by increasing opiate infusion rates. We conclude that (1) continuous infusion opiate with PCA bolus capability can be initiated and administered safely in the home setting; (2) patients with pain related to malignancy can be managed well with this system; and (3) pain control programs can be designed, implemented, and evaluated in the private practice setting.\r"

  ".W": "In order to clarify the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of lytic bone lesions (BL) in multiple myeloma (MM), we have compared the presenting myeloma-induced histological bone changes of 14 previously untreated MM patients with lytic BL with those of seven MM patients lacking lytic BL at presentation despite similar myeloma cell mass. A major unbalanced bone remodeling (increased bone resorption with normal to low bone formation) was the characteristic feature of patients presenting lytic BL. Furthermore, this unbalanced process was associated with a significant reduction of bone mass. Unexpectedly, a balanced bone remodeling (increase of both bone resorption and bone formation, without bone mass reduction) rather than a true lack of an excessive bone resorption was the usual feature of patients lacking lytic BL. Our current work clearly shows that a majority (72%) of patients with MM present an important unbalanced bone remodeling at diagnosis, leading to bone mass reduction and bone destruction (unbalanced MM). Some patients (20%) retain a balanced bone remodeling with initial absence of bone destruction (balanced MM). Few (8%) patients have pure osteoblastic MM without bone destruction.\r"

Liposomal MTP-PE (L-MTP-PE) was infused over 1 hour twice weekly; doses were escalated within individual patients every 3 weeks as tolerated for a total treatment duration of 9 weeks. Routine clinical laboratory parameters, acute phase reactants and various immunologic tests were monitored at various time points during treatment. Toxicity was moderate (less than or equal to grade II) in 24 patients with chief side effects being chills (80% of patients), fever (70%), malaise (60%), and nausea (55%). In four patients L-MTP-PE treatment was deescalated due to severe malaise and recurrent fever higher than 38.8 degrees C. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 6 mg/m2. Significant (P less than .05) increases in WBC count, absolute granulocyte count, ceruloplasmin, beta 2-microglobulin, c-reactive protein, monocyte tumoricidal activity, and serum IL-1 beta were found. Significant decreases in serum cholesterol were also observed. Clearance of intravenously (iv)-infused technetium-99 (99mTc)-labeled liposomes containing MTP-PE in four patients was biphasic; gamma camera scans revealed uptake of radiolabel in liver, spleen, lung, nasopharynx, thyroid gland, and tumor (two patients). No objective tumor regression was seen. In view of its definite immunobiologic activity and lack of major toxicity, additional phase II and adjuvant trials of L-MTP-PE are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-five patients with disseminated skeletal metastases from a variety of tumor types underwent clinical trial of samarium-153 ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonate (153Sm-EDTMP) on a day-patient basis. Individual beta radiation dosimetry was based on pharmacokinetic studies of a 20 mCi tracer dose of 153Sm-EDTMP. The retained skeletal activity varied unpredictably from 40% to 95% of the administered dose, but in all patients greater than 98% of the nonosseous activity was cleared in the urine within 6 hours. Prospective calculation of radiation dosimetry in each patient permitted an accurate dosage schedule based upon total red marrow exposure, starting at 100 cGy and escalating to 280 cGy to define the dose-limiting myelotoxicity. Pain was relieved in 22 of 34 evaluable patients (65%) for periods ranging from 4 to 35 weeks, following a single administration of 153Sm-EDTMP. Recurrence of pain responded to retreatment with 153Sm-EDTMP in five of nine patients. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression manifested particularly by delayed thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts less than 100 x 10(9)/L occurred in 42% of courses when bone marrow radiation absorbed dose exceeded 200 cGy. Myelosuppression was transient and platelet counts had recovered to pretreatment levels within 10 weeks of treatment. 153Sm-EDTMP is effective for the amelioration of pain due to disseminated skeletal metastases particularly with carcinoma of breast or prostate where 83% of patients experienced pain relief. In 15 of the 34 evaluable patients there was evidence of stabilization or regression of skeletal metastases on radiographs and follow-up technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) bone scans.\r"

  ".W": "When surgically removing a spinal nerve schwannoma, preservation of the involved root is attempted and may be feasible. However, in large tumors, sacrifice of the nerve root is often required to achieve total removal of the tumor, and the resection does not always result in postoperative neurological deficit. The present study was designed to determine the incidence and extent of neurological deficit as correlated with resection of the root, performed between 1976 and 1987 in 86 cases at the time of total removal of spinal schwannoma. Thirty-one patients underwent sacrifice of a root critical for the function of the upper (C5-T1, 14 cases) or the lower extremities (L3-S1, 17 cases). This report is limited to these 31 cases. Only seven patients (23%) developed detachable motor or sensory deficits postoperatively. All deficits were no more than partial loss of strength or sensation. Fifteen of the 31 patients had large tumors with extradural components, which necessitated sacrifice of the entire motor and sensory radix; however, 11 (76%) of these 15 did not develop any deficits referrable to the involved myotome or dermatome. Six cases showed histological characteristics of \"neurofibroma,\" with axons intermingled in the tumor, and none developed a postoperative deficit. Preoperative electromyography was performed in 23 cases. Of 13 patients with findings of denervation, five developed deficits after surgery; the other 10 patients showed no evidence of denervation, and none had deficits after surgery. These results indicate that the spinal roots giving origin to schwannoma are frequently nonfunctional at the time of surgery, and risks of causing disabling neurological deficit after sacrificing these roots are small.\r"

Patients with initial focal resections followed by enlargement of the original operative site had the most successful outcome, especially those with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin. The most common cause for poor outcome of the original operation in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy was insufficient hippocampal resection. Patients who were most likely to benefit from reoperation were: 1) those with initially incompletely resected structural lesions; 2) those who were initially evaluated with invasive ictal monitoring; and 3) those who underwent further resection of the initial operative site rather than resection of a different cortical region.\r"

  ".W": "From March, 1984, through June, 1987, 21 newly diagnosed children with high-risk medulloblastoma (Chang Stage T3 to T4) were treated on a 9-week postoperative, pre-irradiation chemotherapy regimen consisting of vincristine and cisplatin. The children over 2 years old then received radiation therapy. Six infants (aged 6 to 18 months) were maintained on chemotherapy consisting of MOP (nitrogen mustard, vincristine, and procarbazine) until the age of 2 years, at which time they were referred for irradiation. Of 13 children with measurable disease following surgery, five showed a definite response on computerized tomography scans to vincristine and cisplatin (one complete response and four partial responses) and five others showed clear marginal responses. Four of the six infants were disease-free at 19, 32, 35, and 57 months from diagnosis. One infant developed progressive disease at the completion of the vincristine and cisplatin course, and a second infant had progression during MOP administration. Three of the 21 children developed hearing loss within the speech frequencies during cisplatin treatments, but there were no other major toxicities. Fifteen children remained disease-free with a median follow-up period of 35 months (range 19 to 57 months). Chemotherapy given between surgery and radiotherapy may allow for the direct evaluation of a specific drug regimen and permit the postponement of radiation therapy in infants. Pre-irradiation vincristine and cisplatin was well tolerated and effective in shrinking the tumor in most children with medulloblastoma. Such chemotherapy regimens have the potential for extending long-term survival in high-risk children.\r"

  ".W": "An excellent response by participating institutions was realized in this survey of patterns of care for patients with primary brain tumors. Since the histopathology of the tumor is such a strong predictor of outcome and influences care so greatly, most analyses were performed not only on the overall series of patients but also by World Health Organization histological classification. Several factors that influence outcome were identified: tumor type, patient age, patient Karnofsky rating, tumor location, and therapy. Very few cases were coded as regards the American Joint Committee on Cancer clinical stage, and few potentially eligible cases were placed in investigative protocols. It behooves those centers providing investigative protocol opportunities to develop liaisons with practicing physicians nearby as well as at some distance and to provide an organizational framework that will make participation in these protocols practical for a larger segment of our brain-tumor patient population. Between 1980 and 1985, the increased use of magnetic resonance imaging in neuroradiology is apparent as well as the increased use of stereotactic biopsy and interstitial radiotherapy. Complications of therapy seem acceptably low. Five-year survival for benign brain tumor is high, while that for the most common primary tumor, glioblastoma multiforme, is only 5.5%. Some of the findings in this survey confirm those from the literature while others, particularly the pattern of care, represent new data.\r"

  ".U": "90063766\r", 
  ".W": "Direct surgery on aneurysms in the cavernous sinus is a formidable technical procedure. The intimate relationship of the intracavernous carotid artery to the venous structures and to the cranial nerves make surgical access difficult at best. Thirty-two of 356 aneurysm patients presented with symptomatic aneurysms originating from the intracavernous internal carotid artery. Twenty-one patients had aneurysms contained entirely within the cavernous sinus, and in 11 others the aneurysms arose within the cavernous sinus and extended into the subarachnoid space. Of the purely intracavernous aneurysms there were five small aneurysms (less than 25 mm) and 16 giant (greater than or equal to 25 mm) aneurysms. Fifteen patients with purely intracavernous lesions had a superior orbital fissure syndrome, and six had a variety of other symptoms. Of 11 patients with subarachnoid extension, five had a subarachnoid hemorrhage (Grade I or II), five had ipsilateral visual loss, and one had periorbital pain. The aneurysms were treated as follows: Group 1 received progressive ligation of the internal carotid artery in the neck with a Selverstone clamp and a surface superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis (purely intracavernous in nine, and with subarachnoid extension in one); Group 2 underwent trapping of the internal carotid artery and a deep STA-MCA anastomosis (purely intracavernous in seven); and Group 3 had direct clipping of the aneurysm (purely intracavernous in five, and with subarachnoid extension in 10). The cavernous sinus was entered directly through its roof by a pterional craniotomy with radical removal of the optic canal, lesser sphenoid wing, and lateral and superior orbital walls. Proximal control of the internal carotid artery was obtained through a cervical incision. Two patients in Group 1 developed transient neurological deficits, which resolved. Two patients in Group 2 developed a cerebral infarction, one of whom died; in both of these patients, the anastomosis was completed after the internal carotid artery occlusion. Two patients in Group 3 progressed from marked visual loss to blindness of the same side, and one developed an intraventricular hemorrhage during induction of anesthesia and died without surgery. It is proposed that a direct approach to symptomatic aneurysms in the cavernous sinus is the best initial alternative. When this approach is not feasible, a trapping procedure preceded by a high-flow extracranial-intracranial anastomosis may be considered. Although the authors have been able to clip aneurysms of various sizes, this has not been possible in all patients. Further work is needed in this area.\r"

Patients detected early with mild neurological deficits fared well with treatment, while those with profound neurological deficits and delayed diagnoses had poor outcomes. Aggressive nonsurgical treatment is advocated including anticoagulation therapy for prevention of progressive thrombosis and arterial occlusion and/or distal arterial embolization with resultant cerebral ischemia. Direct surgical thromboendarterectomy is considered to carry high morbidity and mortality rates.\r"

Recently, improved results have been reported with rapid diagnosis and surgical treatment. A relatively large number of older patients (34 patients over 65 years old) were treated recently at Harborview Medical Center, enabling a retrospective comparison with similarly treated younger patients (33 patients aged 18 to 40 years). Clinical information and computerized tomography morphometric data were obtained. Patients in the younger group were most often injured in motor-vehicle accidents (15 cases), whereas falls were most frequent in the older group (19 cases). Patients in both groups were rapidly resuscitated in the field; more than 30% were treated within 1 hour after the time of injury. Injury severity, determined by the admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, was similar for the two groups. Mean acute SDH volume was significantly larger in the older patients than in the younger group (mean +/- standard deviation: 96.2 +/- 117.2 vs. 21.6 + 27.7 cu cm), as was the amount of midline shift (1.2 +/- 1.69 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.75 cm). Surgical treatments were similar, but outcomes were dramatically different for the younger and older patients. Mortality rates were more than four times higher in older patients than in younger ones (74% vs. 18%). Three older patients and 25 younger patients were functional survivors. Old age, a larger SDH volume, and a larger midline shift all correlated with a poor outcome. The results of this study suggest that the pathophysiology of acute SDH varies with age, and that currently employed resuscitation and treatment methods have differentially improved the outcome for younger patients.\r"

When the values for edematous brain were corrected for dilution, however, the local CBF averaged 25.3 +/- 1.7 ml/100 gm/min, which was similar to the control value. Local CMRgl was found to be significantly increased in plasma-infused white matter (16.3 +/- 2.2 mumol/100 gm/min) compared with that in control white matter (10.7 +/- 1.3 mumol/100 gm/min). This difference remained, despite correction for dilution and recalculation of local CMRgl values based on altered kinetic constants found in edematous brain. A similar increase in local CMRgl was noted with saline-infusion edema. It is concluded that the increased tissue water level does not alter CBF, but does induce an increase in anaerobic metabolism.\r"

The conditioned medium from all cell lines was mitogenic in the monolayer assay, but only SF-210, U-343 MG-A, and U-251 MG produced soluble factors that caused NRK cells to grow in soft agar. The soluble growth-promoting factors from these three cell lines were acid- and heat-stable (60 degrees C for 30 minutes) but were inactivated by trypsin (100 microns/ml) and dithiothreitol (50 microM). The growth factors from SF-210 and U-343 MG-A were further purified by molecular-sieve chromatography. The partially purified growth factor from U-343 MG-A retained transforming growth factor (TGF)-like activity, had a molecular weight of 9 kD, was potentiated by TGF-beta in the soft agar assay, competed effectively with 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) radiolabeled for the EGF receptor on A 431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, and was completely inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to TGF-alpha. The partially purified growth factor from SF-210 had a molecular weight of 17 kD, was not inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or TGF-alpha, and did not bind to a heparin-Sepharose column. These results imply that U-343 MG-A secretes a growth factor with TGF-alpha-like activity, and SF-210 secretes a TGF with neither TGF-alpha nor TGF-beta activity.\r"

  ".U": "90063772\r", 
  ".W": "A vascular permeability factor (VPF) derived from serum-free conditioned medium of cultured human malignant gliomas (HG-VPF) has been described previously. The rapid kinetics of HG-VPF activity in an in vivo assay of vascular permeability suggests a direct action upon the vascular endothelial cell. To determine whether HG-VPF was capable of inducing a physiologically significant alteration in isolated endothelial cells, cytosolic calcium [Ca++]i was measured in vitro in these cells before and after their exposure to media containing this substance. This was accomplished by preloading cultured endothelial cells with a fluorescent intracellular Ca++ probe fura-2/AM. It was found that HG-VPF induced a rapid and transient elevation of [Ca++]i in normal endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein, bovine adrenal medulla, bovine pulmonary artery, and rat brain. This effect was inhibited by chelating extracellular calcium [Ca++]e with ethyleneglycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA), indicating that the HG-VPF-induced response resulted from the influx of extracellular calcium. The addition of cations that act as nonspecific calcium channel blockers (Li+, Co++, Mn++, La ) completely inhibited VPF activity, further supporting the role of [Ca++]e influx. The HG-VPF activity was not, however, blocked by verapamil, a calcium antagonist that appears to be specific for voltage-gated calcium channels. Furthermore, exposure of endothelial cells to 120 mM [K+]e did not result in a calcium transient. Coincubation of endothelial cells with dexamethasone inhibited HG-VPF-induced rises in [Ca++]i, while having no effect upon cyclic nucleotide-induced changes in calcium. The present studies indicate that vascular extravasation induced by human glioma-derived VPF may be mediated by a direct action upon vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, the observed dexamethasone-induced inhibition of this process suggests a specific cellular action for corticosteroids. This, together with previous observations that dexamethasone suppresses both the production of VPF by tumor cells in vitro and its permeability-inducing activity in vivo, may explain the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of neoplastic vasogenic brain edema. Finally, studies with a polycationic peptide (protamine) known to induce blood-brain barrier disruption in vivo revealed similar effects upon endothelial cytosolic calcium levels. As HG-VPF is a positively charged macromolecule, a common interaction between these substances and the negatively charged endothelial cell surface in the induction of permeability is suggested. Nonspecific cross-linking of charged groups of the endothelial glycocalyx and specific HG-VPF receptor binding are both valid mechanisms of HG-VPF-mediated calcium changes. Their potential relevance in the setting of microvascular permeability is discussed.\r"

Four of the seven MAb's did not bind to any of the four normal brain tissues tested, whereas three MAb's bound to one or two of these tissues. Two MAb's bound to the surfaces of cultured glioma cells in radioimmunoassay. One of these MAb's (AS-AY1, immunoglobulin (Ig)(G1) lysed cultured glioma cells with human lymphocytes or murine macrophages as effector cells; the other MAb (AS-AY2, IgM) was reactive in complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay.

The present study evaluated the effect of the calcium-antagonist nicardipine on arachidonate metabolism after experimental induction of SAH. The ex vivo release of four eicosanoids (prostaglandin (PG)D2, PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and leukotriene (LT)C4) was measured at different intervals after SAH induction. Rats were separated into the following three groups: a sham-operated group, an SAH group (rats were injected with 0.3 ml autologous arterial blood), and an SAH-treated group (after SAH induction, rats were treated with nicardipine 1.2 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Nicardipine significantly decreased the ex vivo release of PGD2 at 48 hours after SAH (p less than 0.01). The release of PGE2 was significantly enhanced at 6 hours after SAH, while in the nicardipine-treated group PGE2 release is significantly reduced. Nicardipine also affects the lipoxygenase pathway, reducing the release of LTC4 at 1, 6, and 48 hours after SAH induction. The results of the present study show that nicardipine treatment exerts an inhibitory effect on both biochemical pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism; aside from vascular effects, nicardipine could exert a protective role against the release of arachidonate metabolites, which could play a significant role in the pathogenesis of brain damage after SAH.\r"

The spastic basilar artery was exposed via the transclival route under a surgical microscope and was dilated by the topical application of 1-(5-chloronaphthalenesulfonyl)-1H-hexa-1,4-diazepine (ML-9), a selective antagonist of myosin light chain kinase. Dilation was dose-dependent, with a median effective dose (+/- standard deviation) of 51.4 +/- 6.9 microM. In addition, 50 microM of ML-9 was injected into the cisterna magna until the intracranial pressure (ICP) reached 200 mm H2O for 30 minutes, including a complete reversal of angiographic delayed vasospasm in three of seven dogs; in contrast, 150 microM of ML-9 was infused at 1.52 ml/min into the vertebral artery for 30 minutes, producing little dilation of the spastic basilar artery. In another study, the intracisternal perfusion of 50 microM of ML-9 at 1.48 ml/min for 30 minutes in dogs with an ICP of less than 200 mm H2O produced no serious electroencephalographic abnormalities, and the mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate remained normal; no neurological deficits or significant histological abnormalities ascribable to the intracisternal ML-9 were found.\r"

The tentorial sinuses were classified into four groups: Group I, in which the sinus received venous blood from the cerebral hemisphere; Group II, in which the sinus drains the cerebellum; Groups III, in which the sinus originates in the tentorium itself; and Group IV, in which the sinus originates from a vein bridging to the tentorial free edge. The tentorial sinuses of Groups I and II were frequently located in the posterior portion of the tentorium. The sinuses of Group I were short and most frequently present in the lateral portion of the tentorium. The tentorial sinuses of Group II, which were usually large and drained into the dural sinuses near the torcular, were separated into five subtypes according to the draining veins and direction of termination. The tentorial sinuses of Groups III and IV were located near the tentorial free edge or the straight sinus. The draining patterns of the tentorial sinuses and their draining veins (so-called \"bridging veins\") were present in most cases. Knowledge of this anatomy can benefit the neurosurgeon carrying out repair near or on the cerebellar tentorium.\r"

For these reasons, formulas were developed for estimation of [99mTc]MAG3 clearance based on one or two plasma samples. A two-exponential model provided an excellent fit for 8-point plasma clearance curves obtained from 35 patients having a wide range of renal function. The 8-point [99mTc]MAG3 clearance could be estimated from a single point at 43 min with an error of 19 ml/min (residual s.d.) or from two samples at 12 and 94 min with an error of 7 ml/min. The relative errors with MAG3 are thus comparable to those reported for similar techniques used with [131I]orthoiodohippurate, [99mTc]diethylenetriaminepentraacetic acid and [51Cr]ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.\r"

All patients but one could be followed over 9 yr, 101 after 131I treatment (RIT), another 29 after surgery (S). Ten patients were left untreated. Thirty-four treated (24%) patients died, none as a result of thyroid or post-treatment complications. There was no hyperthyroidism later than 9 mo after therapy. Only 1% (RIT) and 24% (S) were hypothyroid 1 yr after treatment. But 19% of all treated NIH patients were hypothyroid after 9 yr or at the time of their death, 12% after RIT and 41% after S. The cumulative hypothyroidism incidences 1.4%/yr for RIT and 2.2%/yr for S, were not significantly different. Out of the five survivers without RIT or S, two TA patients were hypothyroid. The effect of RIT on goiter related loco-regional complications was not worse than after S. We conclude that RIT is the treatment for NIH, leaving surgery for exceptional cases.\r"

Three different models (rest data, exercise data, and rest plus exercise data) were derived by stepwise multivariate discriminant analysis of RNA data in 65 normal volunteers and 111 patients with CAD and normal ejection fraction (EF) at rest. The model with only resting indices yielded a diagnostic capability comparable to the simple measure of EF response to exercise (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 89% and 91%, respectively). Both the exercise and rest plus exercise models gave better results (area = 94% and 97%, respectively), but only the rest plus the exercise model was better than the EF response alone (p less than 0.001). Thus (a) if resting studies alone are performed, the diagnostic potential of RNA may be improved by combining several indices of resting function; and (b) combined rest and exercise data may improve the sensitivity of RNA in detecting CAD over what could be obtained with the EF response to exercise alone.\r"

Initial and delayed (3 hr) thallium images were obtained in three views after three bicycle exercise tests: to maximal, 80% and 60% of predicted maximal heart rate. The mean of three views initial myocardial 201Tl uptake was higher at maximal than at both 80% and 60% of predicted maximal heart rate, being 81% (p less than 0.01) and 60% (p less than 0.01) of maximal activity, respectively. The myocardial activity in the delayed images was identical. There was a linear relationship between heart rate and the initial myocardial activity, r = 0.86 (p less than 0.001). The mean (range) 201Tl clearance was 58% (51-65), 47% (34-56), and 34% (22-49) (all differences p less than 0.01), respectively. Concordance among the three individual views in estimating clearance was best for the highest exercise level. There was a linear relationship between heart rate and clearance, r = 0.80 (p less than 0.001). Clearance was altered by only 1.67 x 10%/heart bpm (0.024 hr/heart beat). Clearance in the liver, spleen and lungs increased at submaximal exercise levels. Thus, a linear relationship between heart rate and clearance is the result of changes in the initial exercise myocardial 201Tl activity. Submaximal exercise may reduce reproducibility of clearance estimation, and the change of myocardial clearance with heart rate seems less than previously suggested.\r"

Serial dynamic SPECT scan was performed for 50 min following an i.v. bolus injection of IMP in 30 patients with various neurologic diseases. In 18 of them the radioactivity in the lung was also recorded by a single probe detector during the serial dynamic SPECT scan. Brain activity showed a gradual increase after the injection of IMP, reaching 63 +/- 7% of the maximum activity at 5 min and 90 +/- 5% at 20 min. The lung clearance showed a large variation among the individual cases; 29 to 72% (52 +/- 11%) of the initial peak activity at 20 min and 22 to 57% (41 +/- 9%) at 50 min after the injection. A significant positive correlation was observed between the clearance half-time in the lung and the time to reach 90% of the maximum activity in the brain (r = 0.86, p less than 0.001). These results suggested that brain uptake of IMP is influenced by the lung clearance and the optimum time to start SPECT data acquisition using a conventional rotating gamma camera system is 20 min after the injection.\r"

There was a marked predominance of the thalamic perfusion over cortical areas until the end of the second month. The distribution of regional cortical activity followed a strict sequence. The perfusion of both parietal and occipital areas was well-visualized around the 40th week of gestational age and thereafter rapidly rose, always, however, with a slight predominance of the parietal activity. At the opposite, frontal activity which remained scarcely recognizable up to the second month tremendously rose to present the adult-like pattern at the beginning of the second year. The rCBF changes described above are well in agreement with the behavioral evolution occurring during prime infancy.\r"

To elucidate the mechanism of renal excretion, micropuncture experiments were performed in rat kidneys for direct measurements of glomerular filtration and tubular secretory capacity. Fluid of Bowman space was collected from superficial glomeruli and analyzed for its contents of [99mTc]MAG-3, [125I]hippurate and [3H]inulin during constant infusion of these compounds. The ratio of activity of ultrafiltrate to that of arterial plasma was 0.23 for MAG-3, 0.68 for hippurate and 1.04 for inulin which demonstrates that the filtrated amount of MAG-3 is only 23% of that of inulin, presumably because of higher plasma protein binding which was also measured in vitro and found to be 80 +/- 1.5% for MAG-3 and 32 +/- 2% for [125I]hippurate. Proximal and distal tubules were also micropunctured and their tubular fluid as well as the final urine analyzed for the activity of hippurate and MAG-3. The tubular fluid to plasma ratio values along the nephron and in the final urine were all lower for MAG-3 than for hippurate, indicating a lower secretory capacity. From measurements of whole renal clearance, GFR and plasma protein binding the filtered amount of MAG-3 was 0.26 and of hippurate 0.87 ml/min.g kidney weight (p less than 0.001) and the secreted amount 2.01 and 2.38 ml/min.g kidney weight (p less than 0.05), respectively. We conclude that MAG-3 is predominantly excreted by tubular secretion and that the lower renal clearance of MAG-3 as compared with that of hippurate is a result both of a substantially decreased glomerular filtration and of a lower tubular secretion.\r"

The system starts with an automated delineation of the total left ventricle, including possible perfusion defects, to determine the mass and shape of the myocardium. Next, polar maps or bulls-eyes are computed from the delineation, which can then be compared to reference bulls-eyes to detect perfusion defects. The proposed system differs in three main aspects from currently available bulls-eye algorithms. First, radial slices are used rather than short-axis slices. In this way three-dimensional gradient information is retained, in particular near the base and the apex of the left ventricle. Moreover, the reproducibility of this method is expected to be superior, since the interactive selection of short axis slices through the left ventricle is eliminated. Second, the left ventricle is automatically delineated using a flexible computer model in order to obtain higher reproducibility. The resulting delineation contains both mass and shape information. Third, in addition to the classic count rate bulls-eye, a mass bulls-eye is computed, which contains the myocardial mass corresponding to each bulls-eye pixel. Analysis of the count rate bulls-eye reveals perfusion defects, the quantification of the defects is carried out with the mass bulls-eye.\r"

Estimation of the radiation dose to the surface of the peritoneum or to surrounding organs is hampered by the lack of a suitable source region in the phantom commonly used for such calculations. We have modified the Fisher-Snyder phantom to include a region representing the peritoneal cavity which may be employed to estimate such radiation doses. A geometric model is described which is coordinated with the existing organ regions in the phantom. Specific absorbed fractions (derived by Monte Carlo techniques) for photon emissions originating within the cavity are listed. Photon S-values for several radionuclides which have been administered intraperitoneally are shown. Dose conversion factors for electrons irradiating the peritoneal cavity wall, from either a thin plane or volume source of activity within the cavity, are also given for several nuclides.\r"

After 20 Gy single-dose irradiation of 60Co to rat tumor AH109A, the L-[methyl-11C] methionine tumor uptake, the microscopic extension of tumor necrosis and the shrinkage of tumor were compared quantitatively. L-[Methyl-11C]methionine uptake fell to 54 +/- 19% of non irradiated tumor at 12 hr after irradiation. Necrosis extended 49 +/- 7% of total tissue volume after 3 days. Tumor volume decreased 48 +/- 12% 10 days after irradiation. L-[Methyl-11C]methionine uptake by tumor showed a sharp and rapid linear decrease after irradiation and the response of the uptake to irradiation preceded the extension of necrosis and tumor shrinkage. We conclude that radiation effect on the tumor may be evaluated immediately after irradiation by the measurement of L-[methyl-11C]methionine uptake and thus clinical application of positron emission tomography may give a benefit to the patients undergoing radiotherapy.\r"

The relative intensity of the inflammatory lesion was maximal at 24 hr. Discrimination between arthritic and nonarthritic joints as well as correlations between the relative intensity of the arthritic joint and clinical indices of joint inflammation were superior with IgG compared to albumin or nanocolloid. These studies show that localization and severity of inflammatory joint disease can be detected with radiolabeled nonspecific IgG.\r"

The ultrastructure of labeled cells was studied by electron microscopy. The tracer dose and the HM-PAO concentration did not significantly affect phagocytosis and killing. The results of the other tests remained normal. A maximum labeling efficiency of 80% was reached by incubating the granulocytes for 20 min with 10-20 mCi of [99mTc]d,1-HM-PAO containing 50 micrograms of the ligand in 1 ml of saline. There was only a slow washout of 20% of activity from the labeled cells in 24 hr. The ultrastructure was not influenced by the labeling technique. Proven infection sites of 17 orthopedic patients were clearly visualized. After a short transient lung uptake, there was a clear spleen and moderate liver uptake with early bladder and late prominent colon visualization. Because of the lower cost, favorable radiation dose and more suitable tracer characteristics, this technique is a promising alternative for 111In labeling of white blood cells.\r"

The effect of scattered radiation on quantitative accuracy, with and without EWA, is demonstrated with sheet and point sources at various depths. A planar phantom and a clinical 201TI study demonstrate enhanced contrast and edge definition. The performance of EWA in SPECT is shown by 99mTc and 123I phantom studies and a clinical 125I study.\r"

This fact arises most likely from two principal causes: the difficulty associated with interpretation of images presented as series of beating slices, and the formidable computational burdens involved in processing the data. We have addressed both of these issues. A new method, called volume rendering, is used to generate realistic and easily interpreted three-dimensional images of the cardiac blood pool. These images of the beating heart can be displayed in a continuously rotating cine format or viewed in any orientation selected by the observer. Total computation time for a 16-frame gated study, including filtered backprojection, spatial and temporal filtering, and volume rendering, is 82.7 min employing a 32-bit computer and an array processor. With greater use of the array processor it should be possible to reduce the time to approximately 40 min, thus making routine use of these three-dimensional images clinically feasible.\r"

Biotin concentration was measured using the 125I-avidin assay which detects total avidin-binding substances. Water extracts were assayed for free biotin and acid hydrolysates were assayed for total biotin. The results of the 125I-avidin assay agreed with the stated biotin content for most vitamin and nutritional supplements in group 1. Biotin was the only avidin-binding substance in the preparations from group 1, based on reversed-phase chromatography. However, some vitamin and nutritional supplements in group 2 contained nutritionally significant amounts of biotin, particularly if the supplement contained liver or yeast extract. Total biotin was significantly higher than free biotin in one supplement; the difference was attributable to release of biotin rather than a biotin analog. We conclude that biotin may be present in some vitamin and nutritional supplements not labeled as containing biotin; biotin intake might be under-estimated if the subject is receiving a nutritional supplement containing extracts of liver or yeast.\r"

The type of both dietary fiber (P less than 0.001) and fat (P less than 0.05) significantly influenced cholesterol absorption. A significant interaction of fiber and fat on cholesterol absorption (P less than 0.05) was also observed. Chitosan effectively lowered cholesterol absorption more than did guar gum or cellulose, and this effect was more significant when given with safflower or high-oleic safflower oil than with palm oil. When guar gum was the source of dietary fiber, dietary fats did not modify cholesterol absorption. Dietary fiber also significantly affected triglyceride absorption (P less than 0.05). Absorption tended to be low in the chitosan, high in the cellulose and intermediate in the guar gum group. Absorption of safflower and high-oleic safflower oils tended to be higher than that of palm oil when cellulose or guar gum was fed. Guar gum, as compared with the other fibers, altered the absorption pattern of both cholesterol and triglyceride. The results showed that the type of dietary fat significantly influenced the effect that dietary fiber exerted on lipid absorption.\r"

In the colostomized chicken, we observed appreciable decrease in utilization of dietary urea nitrogen. This is the first report demonstrating that the ceca are able to play an advantageous role in nitrogen nutrition of the chicken, because back-flow of urinary nitrogen into the ceca was completely inhibited by colostomy. When colostomized chickens were fed a diet containing urea, little urea was found in feces but the amount of urea excreted in the urine corresponded to 77.5% of urea intake. Droppings of normal control chickens fed the same diet did not contain urea. However, they contained twice as much ammonia as the urine plus feces of colostomized chickens, indicating active and great degradation of urinary urea to ammonia by microflora in the ceca of control chickens. The recycling of urinary nitrogen through the ceca may be involved in the utilization of dietary urea by the chicken.\r"
