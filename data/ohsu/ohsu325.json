  ".W": "We have studied the effect of alveolar hypoxia on fluid filtration characteristics of the pulmonary microcirculation in an in situ left upper lobe preparation with near static flow conditions (20 ml/min). In six dogs (group 1), rate of edema formation (delta W/delta t, where W is weight and t is time) was assessed over a wide range of vascular pressures under two inspired O2 fraction (FIO2) conditions (0.95 and 0.0 with 5% CO2-balance N2 in both cases). delta W/delta t was plotted against vascular pressure, and the best-fit linear regression was obtained. There was no significant difference (paired t test) in either threshold pressure for edema formation [18.3 +/- 1.8 and 17.1 +/- 1.2 (SE) mmHg, respectively] or the slopes (0.067 +/- 0.008 and 0.073 +/- 0.017 g.min-1. mmHg-1.100g-1, respectively). In another seven dogs (group 2), delta W/delta t was obtained at a constant vascular pressure of 40 mmHg under four FIO2 conditions (0.95, 0.21, 0.05, and 0.0, with 5% CO2-balance N2). Delta W/delta t for the four conditions averaged 0.60 +/- 0.11, 0.61 +/- 0.11, 0.61 +/- 0.10, and 0.61 +/- 0.10 (SE) g.min-1.mmHg-1.100g-1, respectively. No significant differences (ANOVA for repeated measures) were noted. We conclude that alveolar hypoxia does not alter the threshold for edema formation or delta W/delta t at a given microvascular pressure.\r"

  ".W": "We constructed and used a mathematical model of maternal-fetal heat exchange in the sheep to explore the effects of changes in certain parameters on steady-state fetal temperatures and to determine whether the fetus in the model has any potential to control its own temperature. The model took into account both fetal and placental heat production and exchange of heat in the placenta, across the fetal skin, via amniotic fluid, and through the uterine wall. The maternal ewe was assumed to be a constant temperature heat sink. Changes in placental or fetal heat production were calculated to change the ratio of heat exiting across the placenta or fetal skin significantly but to have little effect on fetal core temperature, e.g., a rise of only 0.8 degrees C was predicted after a twofold increase in fetal heat production. Fetal placental blood flow was calculated to affect fetal temperature the most of any flow, a reduction to zero causing fetal temperature to rise 5.0 degrees C. Changes in heat conductances between fetal skin and amniotic fluid, or between amniotic fluid and uterine wall, had minimal effect on fetal temperature. From the model calculations here and because heat exchange within the sheep placenta has previously been calculated to be extremely efficient, we conclude that the fetal sheep has little ability to control its temperature by changes in heat dissipated through extraplacental pathways. Thus the model predicts an effective heat clamp that closely links fetal to maternal temperature.\r"

In long-term monitoring, temperature in the lateral ventricle was 0.5 degree C above esophageal temperature and 0.2 degree C below that in white matter 1 cm above, with the offsets fixed throughout the overnight cycle. All temperatures went through similar excursions when the face was excluded from fanning applied to the body. These observations highlight the fact that in humans the defense against hyperthermia takes advantage of cooling distributed over the entire skin surface.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (G-1,6-P2) is a potent activator of phosphofructokinase (PFK) and an inhibitor of hexokinase in vitro. It has been suggested that increases in G-1,6-P2 are a main means by which PFK can achieve significant catalytic function in vivo despite falling pH and that increases in G-1,6-P2 will inhibit hexokinase in vivo. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether contraction-induced changes in flux through PFK and hexokinase are associated with changes in G-1,6-P2 in skeletal muscle. Ten men performed bicycle exercise for 10 min at 40 and 75% of maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) and to fatigue [4.8 +/- 0.6 (SE) min] at 100% VO2max. Biopsies were obtained from the quadriceps femoris muscle at rest and after each work load and analyzed for G-1,6-P2. G-1,6-P2 averaged 111 +/- 13 mumol/kg dry wt at rest and 121 +/- 16, 123 +/- 15, and 123 +/- 11 mumol/kg dry wt after the low-, moderate-, and high-intensity exercise bouts, respectively (P less than 0.05 for all means vs. rest). Flux through PFK was estimated to increase exponentially as the exercise intensity increased and muscle pH decreased at the higher work loads, whereas flux through hexokinase was estimated to increase during exercise at 40 and 75% VO2max but decrease sharply at 100% VO2max. These data demonstrate that flux through neither PFK nor hexokinase is mediated by changes in G-1,6-P2 in human skeletal muscle during short-term dynamic exercise.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine the responsiveness of trachealis smooth muscle in vitro to electrical field stimulation, exogenous acetylcholine, and potassium chloride from dogs with airway hyperresponsiveness after inhaled O3 in vivo and to compare this with the responsiveness of trachealis muscle from control dogs. In addition, excitatory junction potentials were measured with the use of single and double sucrose gap techniques in both groups of dogs to determine whether inhaled O3 affects the release of acetylcholine from parasympathetic nerves in trachealis muscle. Airway hyperresponsiveness developed in all dogs after inhaled O3 (3 ppm for 30 min). The acetylcholine provocative concentration decreased from 4.11 mg/ml before O3 inhalation to 0.66 mg/ml after O3 (P less than 0.0001). The acetylcholine provocative concentration increased slightly after control inhalation of dry room air. Airway smooth muscle showed increased responses to both electrical field stimulation and exogenous acetylcholine but not to potassium chloride in preparations from dogs with airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo. The increased response to electrical field stimulation was not associated with a change in excitatory junctional potentials. These results suggest that a postjunctional alteration in trachealis muscle function occurs after inhaled O3 in dogs, which may account for airway hyperresponsiveness after O3 in vivo.\r"

After evaluation in a comfortable environment (22 degrees C, 50% relative humidity), the men were heat acclimated by treadmill walking (1.56 m/s, 5% grade) for two 50-min exercise bouts separated by 10 min of rest for 10 consecutive days in a hot dry (49 degrees C ambient temperature, 20% relative humidity) environment. During the first day of heat exposure performance time was 27 min longer (P less than 0.05) for the middle-aged men, whereas final rectal and skin temperatures and heart rate were lower, and final total body sweat loss was higher (P less than 0.05) compared with the young men. These thermoregulatory advantages for the middle-aged men persisted for the first few days of exercise-heat acclimation (P less than 0.05). After acclimation no thermoregulatory or performance time differences were observed between groups (P greater than 0.05). Sweating sensitivity, esophageal temperature at sweating onset, and the sweating onset time did not differ (P greater than 0.05) between groups either pre- or postacclimatization. Plasma osmolality and sodium concentration were slightly lower for the young men both pre- and postacclimatization; however, both groups had a similar percent change in plasma volume from rest to exercise during these tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements of tidal volume, breathing frequency, rib cage and abdominal diameter, transdiaphragmatic pressure, and electrical activity of the diaphragm were made while traction or compression was applied to the gallbladder for periods of 30 s. Both forms of mechanical stimulation produced similar changes, including large decreases in tidal volume, respiratory rate, electrical activity of the diaphragm, and transdiaphragmatic pressure swings. Inspiratory rib cage expansion was little affected, but abdominal expansion was greatly reduced, and swings in gastric pressure were reduced more than swings in pleural pressure, indicating a selective decrease in diaphragmatic activity. Recovery of all measured parameters returned toward control values, despite continued traction or compression. Some inhibition persisted after the stimulus was withdrawn. The very brief interval between stimulus and response suggested that the mechanism was a neural reflex. The afferents involved are unknown but are not purely vagal in nature, since qualitatively similar results were seen in animals after vagotomy. The alteration in breathing frequency indicates that at least part of the reflex is supraspinally mediated. The change in pattern of breathing closely resembles that seen in subjects after abdominal surgery and supports the theory that reflex inhibition of breathing contributes to postoperative pulmonary complications seen in those subjects.\r"

At both stimulus frequencies twitch torque disappeared before tetanic torque. The difference in numbers of stimuli required for fatigue was not due to impaired excitation of muscle fibers at either of the two frequencies. At both stimulating frequencies, twitch fatigue appeared to be due to a defect in excitation-contraction coupling and/or the contractile machinery.\r"

After a mean length of follow-up of about five years, the results of surgical treatment were significantly better than those of conservative treatment.

  ".W": "A Gore-Tex prosthetic ligament was inserted, with an over-the-top femoral placement, into thirteen fresh-frozen cadaver knees as a substitute for the anterior cruciate ligament. The femoral eyelet was screwed into bone and the tibial eyelet was attached to a force-transducer, which was positioned and locked on a tibial slider track to record forces in the ligament as the tibia was externally loaded. A reference position was established for the tibial eyelet so that, after the Gore-Tex ligament was implanted, the total anterior-posterior laxity of the knee (at 200 newtons of applied tibial force) matched that of the intact knee (that is, before the anterior cruciate ligament had been cut) at 20 degrees of flexion. With both ends of the ligament secured in the knee, repeated 200-newton anterior-posterior load cycles produced an increase of five to seven millimeters in the total laxity. This apparent stretch-out of the ligament could be worked out of the knee by manually flexing and extending the knee thirty times between zero and 90 degrees of flexion while a constant 200-newton force was applied to the tibial eyelet. After implantation of the Gore-Tex ligament, the laxity of the knee matched that of the intact specimen at 20 degrees of flexion and matched it within one millimeter at zero, 5, and 10 degrees of flexion. For each millimeter that the tibial eyelet was moved distally, the total anterior-posterior laxity decreased by the same amount. The anterior stiffness of the knee after implantation of the Gore-Tex ligament was always less than that of the intact specimen. With an applied extension moment of ten newton-meters, section of the anterior cruciate ligament increased hyperextension of the knee by 2.3 degrees; implantation of the Gore-Tex ligament did not restore full extension, even when the ligament was over-tightened by using a distal location for the tibial eyelet. When the eyelet was in the reference position, the ligament forces ranged from three to 319 newtons when the knee was in full extension, they rose dramatically as the knee was hyperextended, and they decreased to zero in most specimens as the knee was flexed more than 15 degrees. The pull of the quadriceps tendon against fixed resistance always increased the ligament forces. The application of tibiofemoral contact force reduced the ligament forces that were generated during a straight anterior tibial pull.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two herniations of a thoracic disc in nineteen patients were surgically excised between 1972 and 1984. An anterior transthoracic decompression or a costotransversectomy was used for all discectomies. Pain and paraparesis were the most common symptoms preoperatively. The average length of follow-up was forty-eight months. Sixteen patients had an excellent or a good result, one had a fair result, and two had a poor result. Twelve of the fourteen patients who had had motor weakness preoperatively had varying degrees of improvement in motor function postoperatively. Pain was relieved in ten patients, reduced in eight, and unchanged in one. Anterior decompression of herniated thoracic discs yielded gratifying results, but the procedure is associated with some risk of damage to the spinal cord. It therefore requires meticulous preoperative planning and careful surgical technique.\r"

The diagnosis was confirmed histologically in all but one patient. After a mean length of follow-up of thirty-nine months, healing was evident in eight hips (40 per cent) but not in the other twelve. All twelve hips required additional surgical treatment; the average length of time before the additional treatment was required was 9.2 months. The results of two intraoperative diagnostic tests (intramedullary pressure and saline stress tests) did not correlate with the results of biopsy. A perioperative fracture through the site of the decompression occurred in one of the twenty-one hips. Given the relatively poor long-term results and the considerable morbidity that was associated with core decompression, this treatment cannot be recommended.\r"

In most of the bones, there were multiple diaphyseal or metaphyseal fractures, or both. By light microscopy, the outstanding findings were fractures through the growth plate and diaphysis and thinning of the cortices. The etiology of the fractures and the insufficient substance of the bone is the reduction in the intrauterine motion of the fetus, which leads to fragility of the bones and contractures of the joints. The severity of the alterations may have been related to the time of the onset of the abnormalities and to the duration and degree of the intrauterine akinesia.\r"

As infants, the patients had poor muscle tone and developmental delay, and as adolescents and adults, they had varying degrees of proximal muscle weakness and tended to use the Gower maneuver. The most common musculoskeletal problems were dislocation or subluxation of the hip, pes planus, and hypermobility of the joints. The most serious orthopaedic problems were in the hips: ten patients had a total of nine dislocations and six subluxations, nine being present at birth and six developing later. Only nine hips were stable after the initial treatment, and there was a propensity for hip-joint contractures. Scoliosis and patellar instability were also seen. Although patients who have central core disease have been reported to be at increased risk for malignant hyperthermia, this did not occur in our patients.\r"

The average age of the patients was forty-one years (range, twenty-three to fifty years), and the average length of follow-up was ten years. At follow-up, 70 per cent (thirty-six knees) were rated as good or excellent and 30 per cent (fifteen knees) were rated as fair or poor. There was no clear correlation between the quality of the result and the radiographic evidence of the severity of the arthritis preoperatively, the age of the patient at osteotomy, or the length of follow-up. There was a correlation between an improved result and an increased angle of correction after osteotomy, but the values were not statistically significant. The most important factor influencing the quality of results was the over-all level of disease in the knee as reflected in the preoperative knee score. Deficiency of the anterior cruciate ligament at the time of the osteotomy did not prevent a good result. We believe that proximal tibial osteotomy for unicompartmental arthritis of the knee is a good and effective procedure for patients who are less than fifty years old and who have an active life-style, and that lasting results can be achieved if the procedure is done early in the course of the disease.\r"

It has been hypothesized previously that the normal sequence of proliferation, maturation, degeneration, and ossification of cartilage is accelerated in regions of high cyclic octahedral shear stress and inhibited in regions of intermittent compressive-hydrostatic (dilatational) stress. This hypothesis was investigated using two-dimensional, all-cartilage, plane-stress finite-element models of the three basic shapes of human sterna that were identified by Ashley. A mathematical criterion, which combined the opposing influences of the shear and dilatational stresses into a single net stimulus for ossification, was used successfully to simulate the three basic patterns of sternal endochondral ossification that were previously documented. Our findings support the view that mechanical forces may strongly influence skeletal morphogenesis, growth, and development, beginning at a very early stage.\r"

Tibial diaphyses were subjected to subperiosteal osteotomy, held in a neutral position for 10 days and then slowly distracted at 0.25 mm/12 hours, using a dynamic external fixator. Radiographs showed that the gap became filled with callus having three distinct zones. Elongation appeared to occur in a central radiolucent zone; this was bounded by two sclerotic zones. Histologically, the radiolucent zone consisted of longitudinally arranged cartilage and fibrous tissue while the sclerotic zones were formed by fine cancellous bone. New bone occasionally contained islands of cartilage, suggesting it had been formed by endochondral ossification. After completion of distraction, the two sclerotic zones fused, shrank and were eventually absorbed, leaving tubular bone with a new cortex. When the periosteum had been removed at the operation, callus formation was markedly disturbed and there was failure of bone lengthening. Scraping of endosteum, in contrast, did not have a pronounced effect. These results suggest that the preservation of periosteum is essential if bone lengthening by callus distraction is to succeed, and that preservation of the periosteum is more important than careful corticotomy.\r"

The implants generally healed with direct bone-metal contact, showing so-called osseointegration. Only one of the 21 implants which had been in place for over five months did not show osseointegration, probably because of inadequate primary contact with bone. The presence of rheumatoid disease did not prevent osseointegration, but accompanying osteoporosis seemed to be a risk factor.\r"

Histological studies from three to 55 months after operation showed that all the grafts were infiltrated with fibroblasts, and that cellularity in their substance reduced with time, remaining unchanged from 18 months onwards; the collagen bundles were aligned as in a normal ligament from six months onwards. These findings suggest that the grafts reach maturity within the first 18 months and remain unchanged as viable ligaments thereafter.\r"

Pain relief was satisfactory, but function was limited, mainly due to loss of glenohumeral abduction despite electromyographic proof of actively contracting abductors in all cases. Analysis of special radiographs of nine cases showed a direct relationship between the clinical results and the \"humeral offset\", or distance between the geometric centre of the humeral head and the lateral aspect of the greater tuberosity. This offset affects the lever arms of the glenohumeral abductor muscles. The implications for surgical technique and for the design of shoulder prostheses are discussed.\r"

We found that if recovery in the upper roots had not started by three months of age then, at follow-up there was a significant residual functional deficit. In a further 22 babies who showed no recovery of the upper roots by three months, exploration and sural nerve grafting were performed; 20 of these children were reviewed at one year. Good recovery of the deltoid was seen in 80% and of the biceps in 55%, while 25% had good external rotation at the shoulder. We conclude that if there is disruption of the upper roots with no sign of recovery at three months, grafting of these roots provides the best chance of useful recovery.\r"

Poor control of the shoulder often compromised the result. Latissimus dorsi and triceps transfers proved most reliable, and some Steindler flexorplasties also gave satisfactory results. Pectoralis major transfers were disappointing and we do not recommend their use in women.\r"

The frequency of occurrence and sizes of these overlaps were studied in 48 cadaveric fingers; the largest and most frequent overlap was at the distal end of the A2 pulley. Functional studies showed an intricate mechanism of pulley approximation and sheath bulging during flexion. Sutured or partly cut tendons triggered on the free edges; this could be a major contributor to the failures of tendon repairs in \"no man's land\".\r"

Results were evaluated by the Strickland formula of total active motion (TAM) of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. Sixty-two fingers (80%) were rated \"excellent\", 14 fingers (18%) were \"good\", two fingers (2%) were \"fair\", none was rated \"poor\".

Shortening in severe comminution was the main complication and was not controlled by supplementary cast-bracing.

We studied bone induction in primates by excising segments of the fibulae of adult squirrel monkeys, defatting and demineralising them before reimplanting them into the quadriceps of the same animal. As a control experiment, rat matrix was prepared in exactly the same way and implanted in rats. After six weeks the implants were harvested and either ashed and analysed for calcium content or prepared for histology. In the rats, the calcium content indicated that about 20% of the original matrix had been replaced by new bone. In the monkeys the calcium content was about the same as that in normal body fluid and no bone was seen in histological sections. This result casts doubt on the use of demineralised human bone matrix as a bone inductor, although it may function by other mechanisms.\r"

Mechanical tests were made of stability, in comparison with normal joints and controls after excision of the ligament. Some carbon fibre implants broke down in vivo, allowing instability; the fragments caused chronic inflammation. Intact carbon implants did not induce the formation of neoligaments; they were covered by tissue, but there was no ingrowth. Polyester did not degrade mechanically and supported early collagenous ingrowth within the implant, even in the mid-joint space. It was concluded that there was no justification for the use of carbon fibres as anterior cruciate replacements; polyester appeared to be suitable.\r"

A further, small increase of 8% was recorded after intra-articular lignocaine injection. Isometric strength and surface integrated EMG correlated well in six patients. Two reflex mechanisms seem to inhibit quadriceps innervation in the presence of a persistent knee effusion, one mediated by pressure sensitive receptors, the other still unknown.

In two other cases nerve root fibrosis was associated with residual radiopaque lipid thought to derive from earlier myelography. Our findings suggest that risks may be associated with the introduction of foreign material into the vertebral canal, and that microscopic fragments of surgical swabs and patties may have a role in the pathogenesis of postoperative periradicular fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose transport was characterized in rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) of the fetus late in gestation. Highly purified, osmotically reactive fetal BBMV contained a glucose transporter that was qualitatively indistinguishable from that in the adult: both are concentrative, Na+ dependent, electrogenic, stereospecific, and sensitive to phlorizin. Although the apparent Km for glucose is similar in the fetus and adult, the Vmax is significantly higher in the adult. When the membrane potential was clamped with a protonophore, this difference diminished; however, Vmax remained significantly higher in adult BBMV. This postnatal increase in Vmax was paralleled by a similar increase in the number of phlorizin binding sites. These findings indicate that the maturational increase in glucose transport is, in part, consequent to a more favorable electrical potential for Na+-dependent glucose transport and, in part, the result of the insertion of new transporters. The homogenate activity of several brush border enzymes also demonstrated significant maturational increases. The magnitude of these changes was variable and enzyme dependent. These combined observations suggest that mature expression of membrane proteins (transporters and enzymes) occurs at different stages of development of renal proximal tubule cells.\r"

  ".U": "88299147\r", 
  ".W": "Skeletal proteins of the red blood cell apparently play an important role in regulating membrane material properties of deformability and stability. However, the role of various intracellular constituents in regulating membrane properties has not been clearly defined. To determine whether Ca2+ and calmodulin might play a role in this regulation, we measured the membrane stability and deformability of resealed ghosts prepared in the presence of varying concentrations of Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM). For membranes resealed in the presence of Ca2+ and physiologic concentrations of CaM (2-8 microM), membrane stability decreased with increasing Ca2+ concentrations (greater than 1.0 microM). Moreover, Ca2+ and CaM-induced alterations in membrane stability were completely reversible. In the absence of CaM, an equivalent decrease in membrane stability was seen only when Ca2+ concentration was two orders of magnitude higher (greater than 100 microM). Calmodulin did not alter membrane stability in the absence of Ca2+. Compared with these changes in membrane stability, membrane deformability decreased only at Ca2+ concentrations greater than 100 microM, and calmodulin had no effect on Ca2+-induced decrease in membrane deformability. Examination of the effects of Ca2+ and CaM on various membrane interactions have enabled us to suggest that spectrin-protein 4.1-actin interaction may be one of the targets for the effect of Ca2+ and CaM. These results imply that Ca2+ and calmodulin can regulate membrane stability through modulation of skeletal protein interactions, and that these protein interactions are of a dynamic nature on intact membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Since human acute renal failure (ARF) is frequently the result of multiple rather than single insults, we used a combination of treatments to induce ARF in rats. Uninephrectomized, salt-depleted rats injected with indomethacin developed ARF after administration of radiocontrast. After 24 h, the plasma creatine rose from 103 +/- 3 to 211 +/- 22 mumol/liter (mean +/- SE) and the creatinine clearance dropped from 0.7 +/- 0.1 to 0.2 +/- 0.04 ml/min (P less than 0.001). Severe injury was confined to the outer medulla and comprised necrosis of medullary thick ascending limbs (mTALs), tubular collapse, and casts. Other nephron segments were free of damage except for the proximal convoluted tubules which showed vacuole formation originating from lateral limiting membranes that resembled changes reported in human contrast nephropathy. Cell damage to mTALs included mitochondrial swelling, nuclear pyknosis, and cytoplasmic disruption with superimposed calcification; these changes were most severe in the deepest areas of the outer medulla, away from vasa recta in zones remote from oxygen supply. The fraction of mTALs with severe damage was 30 +/- 7% (range 2-68) and the extent of injury was correlated with a rise in plasma creatinine (r = 0.8, P less than 0.001). Thus, the nature of mTAL injury was similar to the selective lesions observed in isolated kidneys perfused with cell-free medium and was shown to derive from an imbalance between high oxygen demand by actively transporting mTALs and the meager oxygen supply to the renal medulla. Combined multiple renal insults in the rat produce ARF that resembles the clinical syndrome of contrast nephropathy and is characterized by selective mTAL injury conditioned by medullary hypoxia.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the cardiac and peripheral circulatory responses to changes in afterload with angiotension and vasopressin, we increased mean aortic pressure 25% and 50% above control in splenectomized and ganglion-blocked dogs. We compared these responses to similar mechanical increases in aortic pressure produced by partial balloon occlusion of the descending aorta. With 25% or 50% increases in aortic pressure, angiotensin, vasopressin, and balloon inflation produced no changes in heart rate, right atrial, and mean pulmonary artery pressures. At 25% increase in aortic pressure, cardiac output was maintained with angiotensin and balloon occlusion but decreased with vasopressin. At 50% increase in aortic pressure, cardiac output was maintained with only balloon occlusion and decreased with both angiotensin and vasopressin. Whenever cardiac output fell, central blood volume did not increase as after-load increased. These changes in preload can be explained by alterations in the venous circulation. Vasopressin did not alter venous compliance or unstressed vascular volume but increased resistance to venous return. Angiotensin also increased resistance to venous return but decreased venous compliance and did not change unstressed vascular volume. Balloon occlusion had no effects on these parameters. We conclude that: (a) angiotensin caused significant venoconstriction resulting in maintenance of cardiac output at 25% but not 50% increase in aortic pressure; (b) vasopressin increased the resistance to venous return without venoconstriction; this resulted in a fall in cardiac output even with a 25% increase in aortic pressure; and (c) the effects of the agents on the venous circulation were independent of the mechanical effects of a pressure increase in the arterial circulation.\r"

A decrement in plasma glucose concentration from 88 +/- 3 to 80 +/- 1 mg/dl for 150 min did not result in changes in the latency of the P300 wave nor in an activation of counterregulatory hormonal response. In contrast, a greater decrement in plasma glucose concentration from 87 +/- 3 to 72 +/- 1 mg/dl for 120 min caused an increase in the latency of the P300 wave (from 301 +/- 12 to 348 +/- 20 ms, P less than 0.01), a subsequent increase in all counterregulatory hormones but no hypoglycemic symptoms. Finally, when plasma glucose concentration was decreased in a stepwise manner from 88 +/- 2 to 50 +/- 1 mg/dl within 75 min, the increase in the latency of the P300 wave was correlated with the corresponding plasma glucose concentration (r = -0.76, P less than 0.001). The glycemic threshold for hypoglycemic symptoms was 49 +/- 2 mg/dl. Thus, in normal man the glycemic threshold for neuroglycopenia (72 +/- 1 mg/dl) is greater than currently thought; the hormonal counterregulation follows the onset of neuroglycopenia; the hypoglycemic symptoms are a late indicator of advanced neuroglycopenia.\r"

  ".U": "88299157\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that oxygen free radicals may mediate postischemic myocardial dysfunction (\"stunning\"), but all the evidence for this hypothesis is indirect. Thus, we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and the spin trap, alpha-phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), to directly investigate whether free radicals are produced after a 15-min coronary artery occlusion and subsequent reperfusion in 30 open-chest dogs. After intracoronary infusion of PBN, EPR signals characteristic of oxygen- and carbon-centered radical adducts were detected in the venous blood draining from the ischemic/reperfused vascular bed. The myocardial release of PBN adducts began during coronary occlusion but increased dramatically in the first few minutes after reperfusion. After this initial burst, the production of radicals abated but did not cease, persisting up to 3 h after reflow. The EPR spectra (aH beta = 2.67-2.79 G, aN = 14.75-15.00 G) were consistent with the trapping by PBN of secondary oxygen- and carbon-centered radicals, such as alkoxy and alkyl radicals, which could be formed by reactions of primary oxygen radicals with membrane lipids. There was a linear, direct relationship between the magnitude of PBN adduct production and the degree of ischemic flow reduction. Recovery of contractile function (measured as systolic wall thickening) after reperfusion was greater (P less than 0.05) in dogs given PBN than in controls. This study demonstrates that reversible regional myocardial ischemia in the intact animal is associated with prolonged free radical generation, and that the intensity of such generation is related to the severity of ischemia. The results provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that reactive oxygen metabolites contribute to the persistent contractile dysfunction (myocardial stunning) observed after brief ischemia in vivo.\r"

Transport of 3-O-methylglucose and 2-deoxyglucose was stimulated approximately twofold by insulin in muscle from normal nonobese subjects and stimulation occurred in the normal physiological range of insulin concentrations. In contrast to insulin stimulation of 3-O-methylglucose and 2-deoxyglucose transport in muscle from normal, nonobese subjects, tissue from morbidly obese subjects, with or without NIDDM, were not responsive to insulin. Maximal 3-O-methylglucose transport was lower in muscle of obese than nonobese subjects. Morbidly obese patients, with or without NIDDM, have a severe state of insulin resistance in glucose transport. The novel in vitro human skeletal muscle preparation herein described should be useful in investigating the mechanism of this insulin resistance.\r"

The carboxyl-terminal peptide and 3'-untranslated (3'-UT) regions are highly divergent and specific for these cDNA clones. By using the synthetic oligonucleotide probes that are complementary to the unique 3'-UT regions of these cDNA clones, we demonstrate that pHMHC2 is exclusively transcribed in the atrium, whereas the mRNA for pHMHC5 is predominantly expressed in the ventricle. This result indicates that pHMHC2 and pHMHC5 code for alpha- and beta-form MHCs, respectively. Furthermore, we show that beta-form MHC mRNA is expressed in adult atrium at a low level but scarcely expressed in fetal atrium. Finally, we demonstrate that MHC isozymic transition in pressure-overloaded atrium is, at least in part, regulated at a pretranslational level.\r"

  ".W": "Children with ventricular septal defect (VSD) often demonstrate failure to thrive (FTT). Such patients usually have reduced systemic cardiac output which has been postulated as a cause for their growth retardation. This study was conducted to ascertain the mechanism of the reduced cardiac output in children with VSD and FTT and also in a porcine model of VSD. Forward stroke volume was reduced in VSD-FTT children, 31 +/- 8 ml/m2, compared to normal children, 49 +/- 15 ml/m2 (P less than 0.05), but was not reduced in children with VSD and normal growth and development (41 +/- 16 ml/m2). Forward stroke volume was also reduced in swine with VSD compared to controls. Contractility assessed by mean velocity of circumferential shortening (Vcf) corrected for afterload was similar in normals and VSD-FTT children. Contractile performance was also similar in normal and VSD swine. Afterload assessed as systolic stress was similar in FTT-VSD children and normal subjects. Preload assessed as end-diastolic stress was increased in the VSD-FTT group. End-diastolic volume was not larger in the VSD-FTT group. We conclude that the reduced stroke volume seen in VSD-FTT children and VSD-swine was not due to reduced contractility, increased afterload or reduced preload. The reduced stroke volume may have been due to failure of end-diastolic volume to increase adequately.\r"

We analyzed PMN from patients with various granulocyte disorders for their content of two azurophil granule constituents, defensins and cathepsin G, that exert microbicidal/cytotoxic activity in vitro, and one component, elastase, that has ancillary microbicidal/cytotoxic activity. PMN from two (of two) patients with specific granule deficiency (SGD) displayed an almost complete deficiency of defensins, which in normal cells constitute greater than 30% of the protein content of azurophil granules. The SGD PMN contained normal or mildly decreased amounts of cathepsin G and elastase. Conversely, the PMN of three (of three) patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) substantially lacked cathepsin G and elastase, but their defensin content was normal or mildly decreased. Both CHS and SGD patients suffer from frequent and severe bacterial infections, and CHS patients frequently develop an atypical lymphoproliferative syndrome. The profound deficiency of PMN components with microbicidal/cytotoxic activity in SGD and CHS may contribute to the clinical manifestations of these disorders.\r"

This mutation, a G to T substitution at the first position of codon 43, changes the glutamic acid coding triplet (GAG) to a terminator codon (TAG). Based on oligonucleotide hybridization studies of 78 Chinese and Southeast Asian beta-thalassemia chromosomes, we estimate that this mutation accounts for a small minority of the beta-thalassemia mutations in that population. Study of the expression of this cloned gene in a transient expression system demonstrated a 65% decrease in levels of normally spliced mutant beta-globin mRNA. However, the study of reticulocyte RNA isolated from an individual heterozygous for this mutation demonstrated a total absence of this mutant mRNA in vivo. The basis for this big discrepancy between the level of accumulated mRNA in vivo and in vitro is probably the result of differences in the stabilities of the mutant mRNA in erythroid cells.\r"

However, the major loci of enhanced synthesis of subfractions of CER-VLDL, their interaction with macrophages, and their relative contribution to atherogenesis have not yet been elucidated. To determine whether anabolism is hepatic or intestinal, subfractions of CER-VLDL were characterized at selected intervals from day 0 to 60 of cholesterol feeding. Rate zonal ultracentrifugation of CER-VLDL from rabbits fed cholesterol for 4 and 60 d demonstrated an early increase of the proportion of cholesterol carried in the intestinally-derived fraction (designated as Fx-I) of VLDL compared with that in hepatically-derived particles (Fx-H). Quantification by size exclusion HPLC also demonstrated that Fx-I was a prominent CER-VLDL component at day 4, while Fx-H particles became increasingly prominent with further cholesterol feeding. At both 4 and 60 d Fx-I stimulated cholesterol esterification and intracellular cholesterol content in macrophages more than the corresponding Fx-H did. In fact, Fx-H harvested at 4 d produced no cholesterol ester deposition. In contrast, Fx-H harvested at 60 d markedly stimulated cholesterol esterification and intracellular cholesterol content. Thus, both compositional and metabolic characteristics of CER-VLDL changed as a function of the duration cholesterol feeding.\r"

We report that exposure to low concentrations of serum induced a large but transient increase in the membrane permeability of those EA that do not lyse. This change in the permeability of the erythrocyte membrane resulted in net uptake of Na+ and decrease in cell K+, without affecting the total internal cation content. Although exposure to serum also allowed for net uptake of larger molecules like L-glucose, it did not lead to cell swelling. Experiments with sera genetically deficient in one of the terminal complement components showed that C8, but not C9, was required to produce the observed change in membrane permeability. Therefore, we propose that the C5b-8 complex can mediate the transient increase in permeability observed in unlysed erythrocytes during complement activation by whole serum.\r"

We recently found that hydrogen ion secretion, which effects sodium bicarbonate absorption, was a transport function preferentially and potently increased by angiotensin II in S1 cells. S1 cells are normally responsible for half of the total renal hydrogen ion secretion. The mechanism by which angiotensin II regulates intestinal sodium transport is by potentiating sympathetic nerve activity and norepinephrine release. Direct control of hydrogen ion secretion by angiotensin II via receptors on epithelial cells has not been previously demonstrated. We now report that stimulation of in vivo hydrogen ion secretion in the rat early proximal tubule by angiotensin II was not mediated via change in nerve activity. Rather, enhanced hydrogen ion secretion by angiotensin II correlated with increased angiotensin II receptor density on epithelial cells in the early compared to late microdissected proximal tubule. Basolateral as well as luminal angiotensin II stimulated bicarbonate absorption. Angiotensin II reduced bicarbonate permeability and caused alteration in the apparent substrate affinity, but not maximal capacity, of the proximal hydrogen ion secretory system involving the Na+/H+ antiporter.\r"

  ".W": "Using isolated, in situ, single-pass perfused rat livers, incubations of freshly isolated hepatocytes, and sinusoidal membrane-enriched vesicles, we and others have shown the saturability of transport (efflux) of hepatic glutathione (GSH). These observations have implicated a carrier mechanism. Our present studies were designed to provide further evidence in support of a carrier mechanism for hepatic GSH efflux by demonstrating competition by liver-specific ligands which are taken up by hepatocytes. Perfusing livers with different substances, we found that: (a) sulfobromophthalein-GSH (BSP-GSH) had a dose-dependent and fully reversible inhibitory effect on GSH efflux, while GSH alone did not have any effect; (b) taurocholate had no inhibitory effect; (c) all of the organic anions studied, i.e., BSP, rose bengal, indocyanine green, and unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), manifested potent, dose-dependent inhibitory effects, with absence of toxic effects and complete reversibility of inhibition in the case of UCB. The inhibitory effects of UCB could be overcome partially by raising (CoCl2-induced) hepatic GSH concentration. Because of the physiological importance of UCB, we conducted a detailed study of its inhibitory kinetics in the isolated hepatocyte model in the range of circulating concentrations of UCB. Studies with Cl- -free media, to inhibit the uptake of UCB by hepatocytes, showed that the inhibition of GSH efflux by UCB is apparently from inside the cell. This point was confirmed by showing that the inhibition is overcome only when bilirubin-loaded cells are cleared of bilirubin (incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin). Using Gunn rat hepatocytes and purified bilirubin mono- and diglucuronides, we found that both UCB and glucuronide forms of bilirubin inhibit GSH efflux in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that the organic anions, although taken up by a mechanism independent of GSH, may competitively inhibit the carrier for GSH efflux from inside the hepatocyte.\r"

An important unanswered question is whether decreased spectrin results in reduced membrane mechanical stability, and if this reduction in membrane mechanical stability can be related to in vivo surface area loss. Using the ektacytometer, we quantitated membrane surface area and stability in erythrocytes from 18 individuals with hereditary spherocytosis and deficiencies of spectrin (30-80% of normal spectrin level). Membrane mechanical stability was reduced and the magnitude of the reductions correlated with the spectrin content. Moreover, the reductions in mechanical stability correlated with in vivo loss of membrane surface area. These data indicate that decreased spectrin content results in reduced membrane mechanical stability and surface area loss in vivo. We conclude that partial deficiencies of spectrin, reductions in membrane mechanical stability, and loss of membrane surface area are directly related and are major features determining the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of hereditary spherocytosis.\r"

Pre-beta-VLDL from dys-beta subjects were larger (27 vs. 17 x 10(6) D) and more triglyceride rich (68 vs. 43% dry weight) than beta-VLDL. Pre-beta-VLDL predominated in the Sf greater than 100 flotation fraction, whereas beta-VLDL predominated in the Sf 20-60 fraction. Because lipolysis converts large VLDL (Sf greater than 100) in vivo to smaller, more cholesteryl ester-rich VLDL (Sf 20-60), it is likely that pre-beta-VLDL are precursors of beta-VLDL. Although beta-VLDL were not found in type V hyperlipidemic E3/3 subjects, they were induced by intravenous heparinization, suggesting that lipolysis of pre-beta-VLDL in vivo can result in beta-VLDL formation. Similarly, heparinization of a dys-beta subject produced more beta-VLDL, at the expense of pre-beta-VLDL. The pre-beta-VLDL from normolipidemic and type V hyperlipidemic E3/3 subjects, respectively, had 90 and 280 times the affinity for the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor than did the pre-beta-VLDL from dys-beta subjects. Heparin-induced beta-VLDL from type V hyperlipidemic subjects had a sixfold higher binding affinity than did heparin-induced beta-VLDL from dys-beta subjects. These data suggest that pre-beta-VLDL from E2/2 subjects interact poorly with lipoprotein receptors in vivo, decreasing their receptor-mediated clearance and increasing their conversion to beta-VLDL during lipolytic processing.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of fasting and refeeding on the glucose transport response to insulin in isolated rat adipose cells have been examined using 3-O-methylglucose transport in intact cells and cytochalasin B binding and Western blotting in subcellular membrane fractions. After a 72-h fast, basal glucose transport activity decreases slightly and insulin-stimulated activity decreases greater than 85%. Following 48 h of fasting, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity is diminished from 3.9 +/- 0.5 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 fmol/cell per min (mean +/- SEM). Similarly, the concentrations of glucose transporters are reduced with fasting in both the plasma membranes from insulin-stimulated cells from 38 +/- 5 to 18 +/- 3 pmol/mg of membrane protein and the low density microsomes from basal cells from 68 +/- 8 to 34 +/- 9 pmol/mg of membrane protein. Ad lib. refeeding for 6 d after a 48-h fast results in up to twofold greater maximally insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity compared with the control level (7.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.2 fmol/cell per min), before returning to baseline at 10 d. However, the corresponding concentration of glucose transporters in the plasma membranes is restored only to the control level (45 +/- 5 vs. 50 +/- 5 pmol/mg of membrane protein). Although the concentration of glucose transporters in the low density microsomes of basal cells remains decreased, the total number is restored to the control level due to an increase in low density microsomal protein. Thus, the insulin-resistant glucose transport in adipose cells from fasted rats can be explained by a decreased translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane due to a depleted intracellular pool. In contrast, the insulin hyperresponsive glucose transport observed with refeeding appears to result from (a) a restored translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane from a repleted intracellular pool and (b) enhanced plasma membrane glucose transporter intrinsic activity.\r"

In vitro, it is a potent inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the first committed step of the pentose phosphate pathway. In man, serum levels of DHEA and its sulfate peak in early adulthood and drop markedly with age. Epidemiologic evidence indicates that low levels of DHEA or its sulfate conjugate are linked to an increased risk of developing cancer or of death from cardiovascular disease. Like cancer, atherosclerosis is a proliferative process characterized by both initiation and promotion phases. This similarity provided a framework in which to study the antiatherogenic effects of DHEA. Rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups. Two groups of rabbits received aortic endothelial injury by balloon catheter and were fed a 2% cholesterol diet for 12 wk. DHEA, 0.5%, was incorporated into the diet of one group receiving the 2% cholesterol diet and endothelial injury and also into the diet of one of the control groups. Animals were killed after 12 wk and aortas, hearts, and livers were studied. Plasma samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, DHEA, and DHEA-sulfate levels. The atherogenic insult resulted in severe atherosclerosis in animals not treated with DHEA. In those receiving DHEA there was an almost 50% reduction in plaque size (P = 0.006), inversely related to the serum level of DHEA attained. Fatty infiltration of the heart and liver were also markedly reduced. These beneficial actions were not attributable to differences in body weight gain, food intake, total plasma cholesterol or distribution of cholesterol among the VLDL, LDL, or HDL fractions. The results show that high levels of plasma DHEA inhibit the development of atherosclerosis and they provide an important experimental link to the epidemiologic studies correlating low DHEA-sulfate plasma levels with an enhanced risk of cardiovascular mortality.\r"

TCM added to the lumen decreased lumen-to-bath 36Cl flux (JCl(LB)) only in the CNT without changing the transmural voltage (VT). In the DCT, 10(-4) M furosemide did not change JCl(LB) even if it was added to the lumen with 10(-4) M TCM, whereas 10(-5) M amiloride in the lumen decreased the lumen-to-bath 22Na flux (JNa(LB)) and VT. In the CNT, TCM added to the lumen did not affect the bath-to-lumen 36Cl flux. Addition of TCM to the bath slightly decreased JCl(LB). Luminal addition of 10(-4) M TCM also decreased JNa(LB). Amiloride at 10(-5) M in the lumen decreased both JNa(LB) and VT. Addition of TCM with 10(-5) M amiloride further decreased JNa(LB) without affecting VT, indicating that TCM affects the electroneutral Na+ transport, which is distinct from the amiloride-sensitive conductive Na+ pathway. When Na+ was removed from the lumen, JCl(LB) was markedly decreased, but addition of TCM did not cause further decrease in JCl(LB). Furosemide did not affect JCl(LB), but addition of both 10(-4) M TCM and furosemide decreased JCl(LB), indicating that Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransport is not involved in the action of TCM. Removal of HCO3- slightly decreased JCl(LB), and TCM caused further decrease in JCl(LB). Amiloride at 10(-3) M, a concentration supposed to inhibit the Na+/H+ antiport, slightly decreased JCl(LB), and addition of TCM caused a further marked decrease in JJl(LB). The similar results were also obtained when the combined effects of 10(-3) M 4,4'-diisothiocyano-stilben-2,2'-disulfonate(DIDS) and 10(-4) M TCM were examined. These findings suggest that the parallel antiport of Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO3- is not involved in the action of TCM. By excluding other possible mechanisms involving neutral Na+-dependent Cl- transport, we conclude that TCM inhibits Na+-Cl- cotransport in the luminal membrane of the rabbit CNT.\r"

Hyperoxia increased SOD activity slightly in postnatal lines but not in fetal lines. The magnitude of the increase in postnatal lines was not significant. Fetal lines exhibit only about one-fifth the SOD activity observed in postnatal lines. The results indicate that, while development-associated changes in SOD do occur in human cells, these alterations do not result from variations in ambient oxygen tension.\r"

  ".W": "Although the degree of hyperglycemia is a powerful and independent risk factor for diabetic microvascular disease, it has not been established if and how high glucose per se can induce the typical lesions of microangiopathy. We have investigated in human vascular endothelial cells the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for collagen type IV and fibronectin, the two glycoproteins characteristically increased in diabetic basement membranes. In 12 confluent primary cultures exposed for 11 +/- 1 d (mean +/- SD) to 30 mM glucose and exhibiting cell number and thymidine incorporation similar to control cultures, the levels of collagen IV and fibronectin mRNA were, respectively, 238 +/- 140 and 221 +/- 231 percent of control (P less than 0.01). The effects of high glucose were selective (the levels of collagen I and c-myc mRNA remained unchanged), independent of the proliferative activity of the cultures and of the plating substratum, and maintained throughout multiple passages. However, several days of exposure to high glucose were required before their appearance. These observations establish that high glucose is a perturbation sufficient to mimic the effects of diabetes on the regulation of basement membrane components and propose that modifications in gene expression may pertain to the chain of events leading to diabetic angiopathy.\r"

This would be expected to influence the likelihood of developing transient bacteremia while undergoing skin surgery on these different areas, thereby affecting the risk of infective endocarditis from such procedures. We evaluated the incidence of transient bacteremia in 45 patients undergoing skin surgery on the sebaceous rich areas of the head and neck. After surveillance skin cultures, aerobic and anaerobic blood culture samples were taken at 0, 1, 5, and 15 minutes after the start of the procedure. All baseline blood culture results were negative. Three of the 45 patients developed transient bacteremia within the first 15 minutes after the start of the procedures. Samples from two patients grew pure cultures of Propionibacterium acnes and that from one patient grew a pure culture of Staphylococcus hominis, yielding a 7% incidence of bacteremia in the 45 patients studied. These data support the use of perioperative prophylactic antibiotics for surgery involving clinically uninfected skin of the head and neck only in patients with prosthetic heart valves. This is in keeping with the current recommendations of the American Heart Association against the need for antibiotic prophylaxis for nonprosthetic valve endocarditis in patients undergoing cutaneous surgery on clinically uninfected skin.\r"

In each skin type category the proportion of subjects with a minimal erythema dose (MED) lower than the median MED of the entire group (%LMED) decreased significantly with increasing skin type number, and distinguished between skin types I through III better than did their mean MED values. Independent predictors of %LMED were skin type and hair color. The contribution of freckles to %LMED was skin type dependent. Age, sex, or eye color had no independent effect on %LMED. The association of skin types I and II, red or blond hair, and freckles with decreased MED may reflect genetically controlled predominance of pheomelanin (a photosensitizing molecule) in the skin of subjects with these phenotypes.\r"

The original 50 patients with Bowen's disease include 12 (24%) with various internal malignancies. In comparison, nine patients (18%) in control group 1 and seven patients (14%) in control group 2 had internal malignancies.

Because of an unexplained persistence of dermatitis in beauty shop clients after exposure to permanent wave solutions containing glyceryl monothioglycolate, we looked for the presence of this or a cross-reacting substance in permanent-waved hair as a possible source of continued exposure to the allergen. Seventeen subjects sensitive to glyceryl monothioglycolate underwent patch testing with hair samples collected before and at various times after a permanent wave containing glyceryl monothioglycolate. None reacted to hair that had not received a permanent, while 7 of 17 showed positive reactions to the permanent-waved hair. Positive reactions were seen in hair collected as long as 3 months after the permanent. This suggests that a glyceryl monothioglycolate-related allergen is retained in hair for up to 3 months after the permanent, which may explain the long-lasting dermatitis that occurs in clients sensitive to glyceryl monothioglycolate.\r"

Daily fish oil supplements containing 3 gm of omega-3 fatty acids (1.8 gm of eicosapentaenoic acid 20:5 omega 3, and 1.2 gm of docosahexaenoic acid 22:6 omega 3) were found to be effective in reducing hypertriglyceridemia, with a significant mean reduction from 215.6 +/- 92.5 to 156.9 +/- 58.5 mg/dl (-27%) when compared with controls (203.6 +/- 46.9 to 204.1 +/- 54.3 mg/dl). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased from 41.4 +/- 10.5 to 46.1 +/- 10.8 mg/dl (+11%), and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased from 6.6 +/- 1.9 to 5.9 +/- 1.7 (-11%).

Therefore, data were obtained and analyzed in 749 patients who were admitted with inferior myocardial infarction to four different centers and followed up for 1 year. Six hundred fifty-four patients (Group 1) did not have complete heart block and 95 (Group 2) had complete heart block during their hospital stay (incidence rate 12.8%). Compared with Group 1, Group 2 patients were older (66 versus 61 years, p less than 0.01), more often had signs of left ventricular failure (p less than 0.001) and had higher peak creatine kinase values (1,840 versus 1,322 IU/liter, p less than 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (24.2 versus 6.3%, p less than 0.001). However, at discharge there was no difference between Group 1 and Group 2 in clinical characteristics, left ventricular ejection fraction (0.52 +/- 0.12 versus 0.52 +/- 0.11) or incidence of complex ventricular arrhythmias on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Furthermore, during the year after hospital discharge, patients in Groups 1 and 2 did not have significantly different mortality rates (6.4 versus 10.1%, p = NS). The incidence rate of reinfarction (4%) was the same in Groups 1 and 2. The incidence of coronary artery bypass surgery was slightly but not significantly higher in Group 1 compared with Group 2 (11 versus 4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and no prior history of heart disease were studied by two-dimensional echocardiography, performed initially 10 to 48 h (mean 18) after admission and serially for less than or equal to 14 days. Serum creatine kinase (total and myocardial isoenzyme) was determined 5 times over the first 48 h; ECGs were performed daily. Neurologic state was assessed with the use of a standard grading system. Four patients (Group I) exhibited left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in one to eight segments. In two of these patients there was also left ventricular apical mural thrombus that embolized in one patient, leading to further neurologic deterioration. The initial creatine kinase myocardial isoenzyme was higher in Group I than in Group II (patients without wall motion abnormalities) (10.3 versus 2.1 U/liter, p less than 0.001), initial heart rate was higher (91 versus 61 beats/min, p less than 0.01), neurologic grade was higher (2.5 to 4.5 versus 1 to 2, p less than 0.001) and inverted T waves were more common (4 of 4 versus 1 of 9).

  ".W": "Although beneficial results have been reported immediately after percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty, little information is available concerning the longer-term outcome of this procedure. The anatomic and functional results of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty were assessed in 20 patients, in whom two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic examination could be obtained both immediately and 6 to 11 months (mean 7.5 +/- 2.0) after balloon dilation. Mean valve area measured by planimetry decreased slightly but significantly from 1.90 +/- 0.59 cm2 immediately after valvuloplasty to 1.62 +/- 0.55 cm2 (p less than 0.001) at follow-up. Individual changes in valve area were variable, and in four patients valve area decreased by greater than 25%. Echocardiographic scores of valvular morphology were obtained by assigning scores of 0 to 4 (with increasing abnormality) to each of four morphologic characteristics of the valve, namely, leaflet mobility, thickening, calcification and subvalvular thickening. This score was higher in the four patients with a decrease in valve area greater than 25% at follow-up than in the other patients (11 +/- 2 versus 7 +/- 2, p less than 0.002). Multiple regression analysis of several hemodynamic and echocardiographic factors identify first the echocardiographic score and second the valve area postvalvuloplasty as the only significant predictors of the percent decrease in valve area (r = 0.70, p less than 0.006). Mitral regurgitation graded by pulsed Doppler ultrasound decreased from 1.9 +/- 1.2 immediately after valvuloplasty to 1.0 +/- 0.9 (p less than 0.003) at follow-up, whereas there was no change in mean transmitral pressure gradient by Doppler echocardiography (5 +/- 2 versus 6 +/- 3 mm Hg, p = NS) and left atrial volume (74 +/- 34 versus 72 +/- 27 cm3, p = NS). Thus, 6 to 11 months after balloon mitral valvuloplasty, mean mitral valve area decreases slightly. Individual changes in valve area, however, are variable. Valvular morphology assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography may be useful for identifying those patients who have an increased likelihood of developing valvular restenosis.\r"

Quantitative measurement of coronary stenosis was achieved by cinevideodensitometric analysis. Actuarial restenosis rate was 12.7% at 1 month, 43.0% at 3 months, 49.4% at 6 months and 52.5% at 1 year. In 219 patients followed up for greater than or equal to 3 months, mean stenosis diameter was 1.91 +/- 0.53 mm immediately after coronary angioplasty, 1.72 +/- 0.52 mm on day 1, 1.86 +/- 0.58 mm at 1 month and 1.43 +/- 0.67 mm at 3 months. In 149 patients followed up for greater than or equal to 6 months, mean stenosis diameter was 1.66 +/- 0.58 mm at 3 months and 1.66 +/- 0.62 mm at 6 months. In 73 patients followed up for 1 year, mean stenosis diameter was 1.65 +/- 0.56 mm at 6 months and 1.66 +/- 0.57 mm at 1 year. Thus, stenosis diameter decreased markedly between 1 month and 3 months after coronary angioplasty and reached a plateau thereafter. In conclusion, restenosis is most prevalent between 1 and 3 months and rarely occurs beyond 3 months after coronary angioplasty.\r"

Coronary occlusion pressure, the ratio of mean coronary occlusion pressure to mean aortic pressure and myocardial perfusion pressure at 40 s of balloon inflation were significantly higher in patients with than in patients without collateral vessels. The changes in left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure, maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (peak dP/dt) and maximal rate of fall of left ventricular pressure (negative peak dP/dt) during balloon inflation were less in patients with than in patients without collateral vessels. Myocardial lactate was produced in patients without collateral vessels but not in those with such vessels. Marked ST segment elevation in the electrocardiogram occurred in patients without collateral vessels but either ST segment depression or mild ST segment elevation was observed in patients with collateral vessels. This study indicates that collateral vessels limit myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion, probably as a result of increased myocardial perfusion pressure.\r"

This finding has several clinical implications. The present study was undertaken with the objectives of assessing the potential existence of differences in baroreflex sensitivity between men with and without myocardial infarction and the time course during the 1st year after infarction of these potential changes in baroreflex sensitivity. Fifty-three subjects entered the study: 32 postinfarction patients and 21 control subjects. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by increasing mean blood pressure by aphenylephrine infusion (70 micrograms/ml) and recording the consequent RR interval changes. Baroreflex sensitivity, expressed as the slope of the regression line relating mean blood pressure to RR interval changes, was evaluated 18 days (n = 32), 3 months (n = 17) and 13 months (n = 10) after infarction. Baroreflex sensitivity was lower in the patients than in the control subjects (8.2 +/- 3.7 versus 12.3 +/- 2.9 ms/mm Hg, p = 0.0001). Moreover, 13 (41%) of 32 patients had a baroreflex slope less than 6.5 ms/mm Hg, which was 2 SD below the mean value of the control subjects. The internal control follow-up study showed that baroreflex sensitivity increased 3 months after infarction to values quite similar to those observed in the control subjects (11.1 +/- 5.3 versus 8.7 +/- 3.5 ms/mm Hg, p = 0.02). No further change was observed between 3 and 13 months after myocardial infarction. These data indicate that baroreflex sensitivity is lower in a proportion of postinfarction patients than in control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty patients (25%) had a peak exercise ejection fraction less than 0.50. All patients were alive at follow-up study. One patient had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and three patients were hospitalized for recurrent chest pain. No patient underwent coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery.

The relative contribution of the hemodynamic load on the left ventricle to the impairment of diastolic function observed in this disorder remains poorly understood. To study this relation, the vasodilator nitroprusside was administered to eight patients with aortic stenosis and normal systolic function. The effect of a short-term reduction in left ventricular preload and afterload on left ventricular isovolumic relaxation and early diastolic filling was assessed by analysis of simultaneous micromanometer left ventricular pressure and radionuclide angiographic volume measurements. At baseline, left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures were markedly elevated, and associated with prolongation of the time constant of left ventricular relaxation and depression of the left ventricular peak filling rate. Infusion of nitroprusside resulted in reduction of left ventricular systolic (204 +/- 31 to 176 +/- 31 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and end-diastolic (31 +/- 8 to 18 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) pressures, with no associated improvement in time constant of left ventricular pressure decay (T) (68 +/- 25 to 80 +/- 37 ms, p = NS), T 1/2 (34 +/- 8 to 34 +/- 14 ms, p = NS), left ventricular peak filling rate (2.3 +/- 0.5 to 2.3 +/- 0.8 end-diastolic volume/s, p = NS) or time to left ventricular peak filling rate (150 +/- 50 to 144 +/- 37 ms, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The total number of single ventricular premature beats, couplets and ventricular tachycardia beats and runs on days 1 and 2 demonstrated a consistent overall correlation (r = 0.76 to 0.84). Individual variability was evaluated by regression analysis with determination of 95% confidence limits. The minimal decrease in arrhythmia density necessary to distinguish true drug effect from spontaneous variability was 64% for single ventricular premature beats, 83% for couplets, 90% for ventricular tachycardia runs and 93% for ventricular tachycardia beats. To meet the criteria for arrhythmia aggravation, the arrhythmia density had to increase by 400, 877, 1,500 and 2,400%, respectively. Multivariate analysis disclosed an inverse relation between day to day arrhythmia variability and baseline arrhythmia density and age. Variability was more pronounced in patients with coronary artery disease but was not influenced by the type of presenting arrhythmia or left ventricular function. The diurnal distribution of arrhythmias and heart rate followed a distinct circadian pattern. These data indicate that, despite good group reproducibility, spontaneous arrhythmia variability in individuals is substantial, necessitating standards to define both drug effect and arrhythmia aggravation.\r"

However, for those patients in each group who had an initial HDL cholesterol level less than 35 mg/dl before exercise, there was a significant increase in HDL cholesterol levels (mean difference 8 +/- 6.9 mg/dl [p less than 0.02] and 11 +/- 3 mg/dl [p less than 0.001] for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively) and a significant decrease in the low density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio (mean difference -1.2 +/- 1.6 [p less than 0.05] and -0.9 +/- 0.57 [p less than 0.001], respectively). Patients in both groups who started exercise with an HDL cholesterol level greater than 35 mg/dl did not show a significant change after exercise. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 achieved similar levels of exercise training after 12 weeks and were closely matched in age, medications, alcohol intake and smoking. The results indicate that among high risk patients (with an abnormally low HDL cholesterol level) exercise training can induce an augmentation of HDL cholesterol in those receiving a beta-blocking drug similar to that of patients not receiving such a drug.\r"

A transient decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (6 to 18%) lasting greater than or equal to 1 min was observed on 36 occasions in 16 patients with coronary artery disease; 12 episodes were accompanied by chest pain or shortness of breath and 24 were asymptomatic. Electrocardiographic ST segment depression suggestive of ischemia was recorded in 6 of the 12 symptomatic and 5 of the 24 asymptomatic episodes. In 10 of the 12 symptomatic episodes, left ventricular ejection fraction began to decrease 30 to 90 s before the onset of symptoms. These studies suggest that continuous monitoring of both left ventricular function and the ECG may permit stratification of episodes of ST depression suggesting ischemia by the degree of left ventricular dysfunction they produce.\r"

Recently, the high dose dipyridamole-echocardiography test (two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring during intravenous dipyridamole infusion, up to 0.84 mg/kg body weight over 10 min) was proposed as an alternative to exercise testing for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. To establish the diagnostic usefulness of the exercise-electrocardiography and dipyridamole-echocardiography tests in this disease, the two tests were performed--on different days and in random order--in 83 consecutive women evaluated for a chest pain syndrome. All 83 women had taken no medications for greater than 48 h, and 15 had had a previous myocardial infarction. Positivity of the dipyridamole-echocardiography test was based on detection of a transient asynergy of contraction that was absent or of lesser degree at rest; the exercise-electrocardiography test (by upright cycloergometer) was considered positive when the ST segment was shifted greater than 0.1 mV 0.08 s after the J point. Coronary angiography showed significant coronary artery disease (greater than 70% luminal reduction of at least one major coronary vessel) in 39 women. No significant complications occurred in any patient during either test. Sensitivity and predictive value of a negative test were similar for the dipyridamole-echocardiography and the exercise-electrocardiography test (79 versus 72% and 84 versus 68%, respectively, whereas the dipyridamole-echocardiography test had greater specificity (93 versus 52%, p less than 0.001), accuracy (87 versus 62%, p less than 0.001) and a higher predictive value of a positive test (91 versus 57%, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this investigation was to establish which measured anatomic variable of stenotic coronary lesions correlates best with functional severity. Therefore, 38 patients with single vessel disease underwent coronary cineangiography and exercise/redistribution thallium-201 scintigraphy. The computer-based Cardiovascular Angiography Analysis System was used to determine the cross-sectional area at the site of obstruction (OA) and percent diameter stenosis (DS), and to calculate the pressure drop over the stenosis (PD) with use of fluid dynamic equations. Coronary flow reserve was measured radiographically. Myocardial perfusion defects on thallium scintigrams were analyzed quantitatively and by visual interpretation. The relations between coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the three anatomic variables were described by the following equations: 1) CFR = 4.6 - 0.053 DS, r = 0.82; SEE: 0.79, p less than 0.001. 2) CFR = 0.5 + 0.75 OA, r = 0.87; SEE: 0.68, p less than 0.001). 3 CFR = 3.6 - 1.5 log PD, r = 0.90; SEE: 0.62, p less than 0.001. The calculated pressure drop was highly predictive of the thallium scintigraphic results with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 90%. The calculated pressure drop is a better anatomic variable for assessing the functional importance of a stenosis than is percent diameter stenosis or obstruction area. However, the 95% confidence limits of the relation between pressure drop and coronary flow reserve are wide, making the measurement of coronary flow reserve an indispensable addition to quantitative angiography, especially when determining the functional importance of moderately severe coronary artery lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional over the wire dilation catheters may be unsuccessful in crossing coronary lesions that are severely narrowed. Hence, a new, extremely low profile coronary angioplasty catheter specifically designed to dilate such lesions was investigated. The catheter features a 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0 mm (inflated diameter) balloon mounted on a guide wire. The deflated profile of the 2.0 mm balloon measures 0.020 +/- 0.001 in. (0.51 +/- 0.03 mm). The catheter can be used in conjunction with 7F angiographic or 8F guide catheters. The catheter was used in 61 patients, aged 43 to 86 years, with predominantly Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III-IV angina. Dilation was attempted in 77 lesions. Lesion length averaged 5.7 +/- 3.1 mm (mean +/- 1 SD), minimal diameter 0.51 +/- 0.25 mm and internal vessel diameter 2.27 +/- 0.43 mm. Sixty lesions (78%) were successfully dilated to less than 50% residual stenosis with this catheter alone; nine lesions were further dilated with a larger balloon catheter. The new catheter was unable to cross 13 lesions (17%); only 2 of these lesions were subsequently crossed with a conventional over the wire system. On the other hand, the catheter was used after failure of conventional dilating catheters in 21 lesions and was successful in 16. The new catheter was particularly valuable for distal lesions and those demonstrating 90 to 99% diameter reduction. For all lesions crossed, stenosis decreased from 76 +/- 11 to 29 +/- 12% after 2.9 +/- 2.7 inflations and peak inflation pressure of 8.0 +/- 2.9 bar. Complications were rare; coronary occlusion occurred in two lesions (3%) and dissection in three lesions (4%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is an important diagnostic and prognostic finding in children with cardiovascular disease, but there are currently no well established criteria for its determination by M-mode echocardiography. Three hundred thirty-four subjects, aged 6 to 23 years, who were free of cardiovascular disease were studied. Left ventricular mass was calculated using echocardiographic measurements in a regression equation for left ventricular mass. Intraobserver (r = 0.96, p less than 0.01) and interobserver (r = 0.89, p less than 0.01) variability were low. To anatomically validate the echographic formula for left ventricular mass, left ventricular measurements made at autopsy were inserted into the formula. Mass was then calculated and compared with the actual mass. There was a strong correlation between the calculated and the measured left ventricular mass (r = 0.89, p less than 0.01). Left ventricular mass was not statistically related to race, but it was strongly associated with gender (p less than 0.001). It was strongly correlated with height (r = 0.82 for males, r = 0.71 for females) and body surface area (r = 0.83 for males, r = 0.74 for females). Echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy in children and adolescents, based on the 95th percentile, for left ventricular mass, left ventricular mass corrected for body surface area and left ventricular mass corrected for height are, respectively: 184.9 g, 103.0 g/m2 and 99.8 g/m for males and 130.2 g, 84.2 g/m2 and 81.0 g/m for females.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The opening of the tricuspid valve and the onset of right ventricular filling precede the opening of the mitral valve and the onset of flow in the normal adult. Sixty-five studies of atrioventricular flow with range-gated pulsed Doppler echocardiography, performed on 32 normal neonates, consistently demonstrated the reverse sequence. Further investigation showed that at the time of mitral valve opening, while the tricuspid valve was still closed, the valve of the foramen ovale began to bow posteriorly into the left atrium and remained posteriorly bowed for most of diastole. The magnitude of posterior bowing varied among the neonates but, concomitant with the more prominent grades of posterior bowing, right to left shunting across the foramen ovale was demonstrated on color flow mapping. Ultrasound studies in the normal fetus also revealed earlier opening of the mitral valve, bowing of the valve of the foramen ovale into the left atrium and right to left shunting across the foramen ovale. These findings indicate that in the normal immature heart isovolumic ventricular relaxation is completed earlier on the left than on the right side and that left ventricular compliance appears to be greater than right ventricular compliance. The relation of left and right ventricular compliance in the adult is different from that in the normal immature heart. Whereas systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and pressure levels change rapidly in the newborn period, ventricular compliance matures over a longer period of time. As a result of the differential maturity, for a variable period of time in the normal neonate, a left to right ductal shunt coexists with a right to left atrial shunt.\r"

Of the 27 neonates 25 had pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum and the remaining 2 had \"functional pulmonary atresia\" secondary to severe Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve. In all 25 neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, the diagnosis and right ventricular morphology based on the tripartite approach were correctly established by echocardiography. The associated Ebstein's anomaly in two babies with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum was also correctly identified by echocardiography. Among the five babies who had a sinusoidal-coronary artery communication, echocardiography demonstrated the fistula in one and provided clues for its diagnosis in two others. In the 25 neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, the echocardiographic dimensions of their tricuspid anulus, right ventricular infundibulum and main pulmonary artery correlated well with the angiocardiographic measurements (r greater than 0.8). The results of this study suggest that, in the management of neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, preoperative evaluation by echocardiography is usually sufficient and cardiac catheterization should be reserved for selected cases.\r"

The increase in intracranial pressure ranged from 75 to greater than 500 mm Hg. With few exceptions, mean arterial pressure increased to as high as 227 mm Hg during the increase in intracranial pressure. Significant increases in plasma catecholamines, major electrocardiographic changes and a considerably shortened survival time were observed only in the rats that demonstrated an increase in mean arterial pressure greater than 50 mm Hg. A perfusion study with liquid silicone rubber (Microfil) revealed dilated irregular myocardial vessels with areas of focal constriction consistent with microvascular spasm. Histologic examination of the myocardium revealed widespread patches of contraction band necrosis and occasional contraction bands in the smooth muscle media of large coronary arteries. These observations suggest that myocardial damage after suddenly increased intracranial pressure resulted both from exposure to toxic levels of catecholamines and from myocardial reperfusion. Extension of these studies to humans suggests that a detailed assessment of myocardial function should be performed in victims of severe brain injury. Myocardial dysfunction may be a major determinant of the patient's prognosis or may render the heart unsuitable for transplantation.\r"

In part 1 of the experiments, six dogs (19.6 +/- 1.1 kg) were utilized. Monophasic pulses of 5, 7.5, 10 and 12.5 ms duration were compared with biphasic pulses of the same total duration. The biphasic pulses had an initial positive phase (P1) followed by a terminal negative phase (P2) with the initial voltage equal for each phase. For each biphasic total pulse width, five relative P1 versus P2 durations were tested (50 and 50%, 75 and 25%, 90 and 10%, 25 and 75%, 10 and 90%). Ventricular fibrillation was induced by alternating current and pulse configurations were tested randomly to determine the minimal voltage and energy for defibrillation (threshold). Biphasic shocks with P1 longer than P2 were associated with significantly lower (p less than 0.01) energy thresholds than were monophasic shocks. Additionally, there was no significant relation between pulse width and voltage or energy thresholds. In part 2 of the experiments, six dogs (20.2 +/- 1.6 kg) were studied. Monophasic shocks were compared with biphasic shocks with P1 versus P2 durations of 75 and 25% and 90 and 10% for total pulse widths of 7.5, 10 and 12.5 ms. Threshold determinations were performed as in part 1. Subsequently, five initial voltages clustered about threshold were randomly tested four times and dose-response curves constructed for each pulse configuration with the use of stepwise logistic regression. Biphasic shocks resulted in significantly lower energy (p less than 0.0001) and voltage (p less than 0.001) requirements than did monophasic shocks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The energy required for a 50% probability of successful defibrillation (E50) was used as the index of ventricular defibrillation threshold. The dogs were classified into three groups: a saline group (n = 6), a low dose recainam group (n = 6) and a high dose recainam group (n = 5). The low dose infusion involved an intravenous loading dose of 3.75 mg/kg body weight over 20 min followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.0375 mg/kg per min.

The low dose recainam infusion produced a plasma recainam concentration of 3.1 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml and significantly increased QRS duration by 11.3 +/- 3% during sinus rhythm. The high dose recainam infusion produced a plasma concentration of 7.7 +/- 0.9 microgram/ml and significantly increased QRS duration by 27 +/- 7% in sinus rhythm. Recainam did not change ventricular effective refractory period or sinus cycle length.

Some surgeons believe that these effects complicate the discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Accordingly, the hemodynamic effects of amiodarone were evaluated in two groups of anesthetized mongrel dogs that had undergone a median sternotomy. A control group of 10 dogs and an amiodarone-treated group (15 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks) of 10 dogs were studied, and serum (0.26 to 1.09 micrograms/ml) and tissue (cardiac 2.97 to 11.60 micrograms/ml) levels of amiodarone were measured by liquid chromatography. Hemodynamic measurements were made at baseline and after administration of routine therapeutic intravenous doses of dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg per min), isoproterenol (0.06 micrograms/kg per min) and epinephrine (2 micrograms/min). The amiodarone-treated dogs had a smaller increase in cardiac output compared with baseline than did control dogs. For each drug when the amiodarone-treated group was compared with the control group, increases in cardiac output (liters/min) were: dobutamine, 1.32 +/- 0.24 versus 1.73 +/- 0.31; isoproterenol, 0.84 +/- 0.26 versus 1.43 +/- 0.28; epinephrine, 0.25 +/- 0.15 versus 0.44 +/- 0.53. Amiodarone-treated dogs were also given higher doses of drugs, dobutamine (50 micrograms/kg per min), isoproterenol (1.2 micrograms/kg per min) and epinephrine (20 micrograms/min). Increases in cardiac output were 1.24 +/- 0.24, 1.62 +/- 0.25 and 2.82 +/- 0.64, respectively. All cardiac outputs were significantly increased from the baseline values (p less than 0.05) except those measured in the amiodarone group receiving the lower dose of epinephrine. Thus, amiodarone-treated dogs have a relative reduction of perioperative cardiac systolic reserve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two microbubble sizes were obtained by sonicating Renografin-76 (meglumine sodium diatrizoate): mean diameter 12 +/- 3 (SEE) and 20 +/- 6 micron. Four doses (range 0.5 to 3 ml) of each of four agents (12 and 20 micron bubbles in Renografin, nonsonicated Renografin and saline solution) were injected in random order. Significant relations were found between percent depression of systolic wall thickening, duration of regional wall motion abnormalities and contrast washout time versus microbubble size (p less than 0.001) and microbubble dose (p less than 0.01). Little increased contrast effect was found at larger doses or with larger microbubbles compared with the smaller doses and size studied.

The most significant of these was the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). An individual decrease in DLCO greater than or equal to 15% gave an optimal sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89% for the diagnosis of pulmonary toxicity. However, a decrease in DLCO greater than or equal to 15% did not alone warrant a change in therapy in asymptomatic patients.

After a 2 week single blind placebo period, patients entered a double blind crossover phase alternating between 4 weeks of placebo and 4 weeks of amlodipine. The two 4 week periods were separated by a 1 week single blind placebo washout period. The efficacy of drug therapy was assessed by frequency of angina, nitroglycerin consumption, peak oxygen consumption during a maximal treadmill exercise test and endurance time during a separate exercise test performed at 70% of the peak work capacity determined before randomization. There was a reduction in angina frequency during the double blind placebo and amlodipine studies (single blind placebo 14 +/- 2 episodes/2 weeks, double blind placebo 7 +/- 2 episodes/2 weeks [p less than 0.005], amlodipine 6 +/- 3 episodes/2 weeks, [p less than 0.005]), whereas nitroglycerin consumption was reduced with amlodipine (single blind placebo 12 +/- 4 tablets/2 weeks, double blind placebo 8 +/- 3 tablets/2 weeks, amlodipine 5 +/- 3 tablets/2 weeks [p less than 0.01]). Amlodipine produced a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption (single blind placebo 18.7 +/- 1.1 ml/kg per min, double blind placebo 18.2 +/- 1.8 ml/kg per min, amlodipine 20.4 +/- 1.6 ml/kg per min [p less than 0.05]) and endurance time (single blind placebo 15.2 +/- 1.5 min, double blind placebo 15.8 +/- 2.1 min, amlodipine 20.2 +/- 2.5 min [p less than 0.005]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore, this is the time for updating practice profile studies. Such studies today could be formulated in a manner to provide more detailed information on the cardiologist's daily activities. In addition, a data base developed through methodology such as the consensus formation approach must be developed and updated on a periodic basis. Through such analyses it will be possible to quantitate the future needs of cardiovascular manpower.\r"

These measurements were made before (baseline) and at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the infusion began. Plasma theophylline concentrations were kept constant in a near midpoint therapeutic range (mean +/- SEM, 14.1 +/- 1.3 to 16.1 +/- 1.1 micrograms/ml) during the 24- to 72-hour infusion periods. Compared with the respective baseline values (383.8 +/- 56.0 and 67.6 +/- 11.8 pg/ml for NE and E), the following postinfusion plasma catecholamines reached statistically significant difference: 664.0 +/- 125.1 pg/ml for NE at 24 hours (p less than 0.05), and 214.9 +/- 57.8, 233.7 +/- 82.2, and 137.6 +/- 39.4 pg/ml for E at 2, 24, and 48 hours (p less than 0.01). Despite the fact that similar plasma theophylline concentrations were maintained, plasma E, which peaked at 24 hours after dose, returned toward the baseline at the end of infusion (99.7 +/- 24.1 pg/ml), whereas this trend was not observed for NE. The postinfusion PEF increased (p less than 0.01) in a stepwise fashion, compared with the baseline, as the infusion progressed. The change in PEF correlated significantly (p less than 0.002) with plasma theophylline concentrations but not with the increase in plasma E from the baseline. Theophylline concentrations did not correlate with the increase in plasma NE or E from the baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After desensitization, the patient tolerated, without signs of allergic reaction, intravenous piperacillin. Immunologic studies were undertaken to investigate humoral and cellular changes accompanying desensitization. Serum penicilloyl IgG and IgE antibodies did not change significantly during induction of clinical tolerance to the drug. The patient's previously positive immediate skin reaction to penicilloyl polylysine (PPL) converted to negative. Nonspecific releasability of skin mast cells as tested with polymyxin B skin test was unchanged. In contrast, in vitro blood basophil activation, both by specific antigen (penicilloyl-human albumin) and a nonspecific IgE-dependent stimulus (anti-IgE) remained strong after the desensitization procedure and during weeks of high-dose piperacillin therapy. A monovalent penicilloyl hapten inhibited penicilloyl-albumin-induced basophil histamine release, whereas the patient's own serum taken while the patient was receiving treatment did not. Moreover, the patient's treatment serum, while the patient was receiving piperacillin, was able to trigger histamine release from passively sensitized basophils of a donor not allergic to penicillin, suggesting the presence of a sufficient amount of complete multivalent antigen to initiate release and/or desensitization. The presence of high concentrations of penicilloated serum proteins in the patient's treatment serum was confirmed by immunoassay. Basophil histamine release could, nevertheless, be elicited from the patient's whole blood sample taken while the patient was receiving piperacillin treatment by adding penicilloyl-human albumin in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Raised concentrations of cord blood serum (CBs) IgE have previously been demonstrated to reflect a hereditary predisposition for atopy in First World, predominantly white populations. A cross-sectional study of 53 black, 52 white, and 58 mixed race newborn infants and maternal pairs was performed in a multiethnic, mixed First and Third World society. The CBs IgE concentrations were measured with a modification of the standard IgE PRIST, which could reliably determine IgE concentrations to an accuracy of 0.01 kU/L. The black group had the highest geometric mean and median CBs IgE concentrations (0.21; 0.16 kU/L), followed by the white group (0.12; 0.12 kU/L) and the mixed group (0.10; 0.08 kU/L). If those newborn infants with an atopic family history and maternal ascariasis were excluded, the remainder had geometric mean and median CBs IgE concentrations of 0.20; 0.16 kU/L in the black subgroup, followed by values of 0.06; 0.05 kU/L in the mixed subgroup, and 0.05; 0.07 kU/L in the white subgroup. Statistically significant ethnic differences in the median CBs IgE concentrations of these subgroups were demonstrated between the black-white (p less than 0.05) and the black-mixed (p less than 0.005) ethnic groups. A positive family history of atopy influenced the CBs IgE concentrations in the white and mixed groups but not in the black group. Of those newborn infants with a CBs IgE concentration greater than 0.5 kU/L, a family history of atopy was found in 100% of the white newborn infants, in 58.3% of the mixed newborn infants, and only in 14.3% of the black newborn infants. Many of the black newborn infants without a family history of atopy had extremely high CBs IgE concentrations. The influence of maternal ascariasis was equivocal in the mixed group but of no significance in the black group. The high CBs IgE concentrations in the black newborn infants, independent of an atopic family history and maternal ascariasis, suggest that this atopic marker may therefore be of limited use in identifying the \"high allergic-risk\" newborn infant in black Third World populations who appear to represent a pool of genetic high IgE-responder phenotypes.\r"

  ".W": "In established experimental models of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and, perhaps, in exposed, asymptomatic humans, continued aerosol exposure to protein antigen results in waning disease and a state of desensitization. The mechanisms causing such unresponsiveness are not well understood, but a possibility is enhanced immunosuppression by alveolar macrophages or other bronchoalveolar cells. Similarly, a loss of immunosuppressive function could result in the appearance of alveolitis. We therefore compared the ability of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells to augment or suppress antigen-specific lymphocyte blastogenesis in rabbit models of acute and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, desensitized animals, and control animals. We found that BAL cells from all treatment groups suppressed antigen-specific lymphocyte blastogenesis at BAL:lymph node cell ratios of 1:1 to 1:8. BAL cells from some animals were suppressive at high BAL concentrations and, at lower concentrations, augmented the blastogenic response. Additional studies revealed no significant differences in the ability of mitomycin C-treated BAL cells to suppress or augment autologous lymphocyte blastogenesis at any ratio tested. Low-density, macrophage-enriched BAL cells obtained by Percoll fractionation maintained suppressive function. Addition of indomethacin to cultures only partially abrogated BAL-mediated suppression of antigen-specific blastogenesis. We conclude that the development of alveolitis in this model cannot be attributed to loss, nor can desensitization be explained by augmentation, of alveolar macrophage immunosuppressive function.\r"

After this protocol was completed, the large saline bottles were replaced by 20 cc vials; 11/23 completed 1 year of this treatment (protocol 2 [P2]). Equipment contamination was checked in all initial 23 patients after one-time nebulization in the laboratory with fresh material (protocol 3 [P3]). We found that DJN leads to equipment contamination in 20/23 subjects of P1 and 3/11 subjects of p2; saline bottles and the nebulizer were the most frequently contaminated items (32/41 equipment items in P1 and 10/55 in P2). The contamination was predominantly bacterial with oropharyngeal saprophytes (19 in p1, O in P2) or gram-negative bacilli (47 in P1, 8 in P2). Bacterial growth was heavier in P1 than in P2.

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent phospholipid that has been implicated as a mediator of allergic inflammatory responses, since it may induce a biphasic response and eosinophil infiltration in the skin that is reminiscent of antigen-induced reactions after cutaneous administration in man. We have studied the effect of a PAF antagonist, the ginkgolide mixture, BN52063, to determine the role of PAF in antigen-induced cutaneous responses in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 10 atopic subjects. Two hours after ingestion of BN52063 (120 mg), the wheal-and-flare response to intradermal PAF (200 ng), but not to histamine (1 micrograms), was inhibited, as previously described in nonatopic subjects. The late-onset component of the response to allergen (8 hours after injection) was significantly attenuated from 2.89 +/- 0.76 cm3 to 1.41 +/- 0.58 cm3 (p less than 0.05). Although the early wheal response was reduced in 50% of subjects, it was not significant overall, nor was there any significant reduction in the flare response. These observations suggest that PAF contributes to the late inflammatory response to allergen that is known to be associated with an inflammatory cell (predominantly eosinophil) infiltrate. This lends support to the idea that PAF is a mediator of allergic inflammation and that PAF antagonists may have a therapeutic role in allergic diseases.\r"

Skin testing with extracts prepared from ingredients in the food supplements revealed marked sensitization of all of the subjects to cottonseed protein. Double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges performed in two subjects with cottonseed flour produced reactions consisting of oropharyngeal pruritus, rhinitis, nausea, diaphoresis, dyspnea, cough, and a fall in pulmonary function tests of 45% or more. All placebo challenges were negative. Because of the reactions observed during these challenges, other subjects were not challenged orally with cottonseed protein but consumed without incident other ingredients in the supplement to which they were skin test positive. Our evaluation strongly incriminates cottonseed protein as the cause of the systemic allergic reactions in these subjects and is consistent with earlier articles in the literature describing the potent allergenicity of cottonseed protein.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism(s) by which repeated cold challenge in a patient with idiopathic acquired cold urticaria resulted in the induction of clinical tolerance to cold stimuli was studied. Plasma histamine levels, mast cell ultrastructure, and the cutaneous response to intradermal injections of morphine, histamine, and substance P were examined before and after the induction of tolerance. Plasma histamine levels draining cold-challenged, clinically tolerant skin were markedly diminished compared to histamine levels obtained during cold-induced angioedema. Furthermore, electronmicroscopy of skin samples taken from tolerant skin after cold challenge revealed intact, largely normal appearing mast cells. Intradermal injection of mast cell secretagogues and vasoactive agonists into normal and tolerant skin sites resulted in similar whealing responses. Thus, these studies suggest that the state of clinical tolerance to cold stimuli is due neither to mast cell-mediator depletion or tachyphylaxis of the cutaneous vasculature to vasoactive agonists. It appears likely that tolerance may be due to the induction of a specific state of unresponsiveness of mast cells to cold stimuli or possibly to depletion of a cold-induced cutaneous antigen capable of triggering mast cell degranulation.\r"

In the first patient, the urticaria began during pregnancy and persisted after delivery with symptoms flaring premenstrually thereafter. Danazol was selected in an attempt to suppress progesterone levels, theoretically by inhibiting ovulation. The patient's urticaria markedly improved, however, within 24 hours. Several months later, she was switched to stanozolol with further improvement. Three other individuals were treated with stanozolol with dramatic improvement. In all, three patients have experienced the induction of five remissions (there were two recurrences), and one patient remains much improved. All subjects have stopped both stanozolol and glucocorticosteroids. Stanozolol appears to act synergistically with glucocorticosteroids, and together, they may be capable of inducing remission in some patients.\r"

A crossover study comparing the pharmacokinetic and clinical response to Theolan Suspension (administered every 12 hours) with aminophylline solution (administered every 8 hours) in children younger than 12 years of age is reported. Twenty-seven patients completed the study: 17 children were aged 6 years or younger and five patients were 3 years or younger. All patients were withdrawn from bronchodilator therapy and then were titrated to clinically effective doses of study medication. There was an equivalent and significant reduction from baseline levels in the mean symptom score during administration of theophylline suspension (42%; p less than or equal to 0.001) and aminophylline solution (57%; p less than or equal to 0.001). Mean values for FEV1 (1.2 versus 1.3 L), FEV1/FVC (77% versus 79%), and reduction in acute metaproterenol use (24% versus 43%) in children receiving theophylline suspension and aminophylline solution revealed no differences between products. Adverse effects were reported more frequently for the aminophylline solution, possibly caused in part to its taste. Of children stating a taste preference, eight of 10 children chose the Theolan Suspension. The suspension demonstrated a lower peak theophylline blood level at a later time (11.6 micrograms/ml at 3 1/2 hours), compared to the solution (14.6 micrograms/ml at 1 1/2 hours; p less than or equal to 0.01). Indexes of theophylline fluctuation during the dosing interval indicated equivalent or reduced variability for the suspension. Relative bioavailability of theophylline suspension was 89% of that for the solution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-nine patients (4% of all patients) experienced 33 late reactions. Fifty-six injections (0.16% of all injections) were associated with the 33 late reactions. The most common clinical manifestation of a late reaction was urticaria. However, objective respiratory airway involvement, as manifested by wheezing and/or stridor, occurred in 10 (27%) of the late reactions. Delayed reactions involving wheezing and/or stridor were only related to injections from maintenance vials, and all these more severe reactions occurred no later than 60 minutes after injection. We conclude that late systemic-allergic reactions account for a significant percent of the total number of systemic-allergic reactions to inhalant allergen immunotherapy. It is our belief that a 60-minute postinjection waiting period for injections administered from maintenance vials of extract would enhance the safety of inhalant allergen immunotherapy.\r"

The screening questionnaire was completed by 292 subjects, and 91 were selected for the psychiatric interview. The validity coefficients were as follows: sensitivity 61%, specificity 89%, positive predictive value 66%, negative predictive value 87% and misclassification rate 18%. A discriminant analysis using a stepwise procedure was then applied to select the best item discriminators of the screening questionnaire. The best set of discrimination comprised six items leading to the following validity coefficients: sensitivity 82%, specificity 77%, positive predictive value 58%, negative predictive value 92% and misclassification rate 21%. The possible factors related to false positive and false negative responses on the screening are discussed.\r"

Twenty-seven patients with UI were assigned based on the number of baseline accidents documented in a self-maintained log, their sex, and the predominant pattern of symptoms (urge or stress) to one of two treatment groups: biofeedback (13 patients) or behavioral training not utilizing biofeedback (14 patients). Patients were given up to six treatments. Patients in both groups achieved a highly significant (P less than .001) reduction in urinary accidents 1 month following treatments compared with their baseline number of accidents. The average reduction of accidents over this time period was 79% for the biofeedback group and 82% for the group receiving behavioral training without biofeedback. All patients showed improvement and no patient experienced any side effect. A internist/geriatrician and a geriatric nurse practitioner may achieve success utilizing behavioral therapy with or without biofeedback for the treatment of chronic urinary incontinence for ambulatory elderly patients.\r"

Factors associated with immobility included contractures, severe dementia, poor vision, and history of hip/leg fractures. Factors not associated with immobility included age, osteoarthritis, mild to moderate dementia, weight gain, and broad categories of selected medications. The immobile patients were further analyzed by subgrouping into those with and without contractures. Contractures were significantly associated with severe dementia. The finding that immobility was not identified on problem lists for 85% (29) of the immobile residents and that for 29% (10) reasons for immobility could not be ascertained suggest that immobility is frequently not documented as a major problem in medical records nor adequately evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "In view of the additional time that older persons require for giving and receiving information, as well as for the examination process, it is important for manpower and reimbursement planning to better understand the nature of the physician-patient encounter with the elderly. We examined a series of national surveys of physicians' professional activities and found that physicians tend to spend less time with their older patients and also that encounter time by physicians in different specialties varies widely. Internists and cardiologists spend substantially more time with patients compared with general and family practitioners. For 65-74-year-old ambulatory patients, the average visit lengths are 18.3 minutes for internists, 18.0 for cardiologists, 11.2 for general practitioners, and 12.1 for family practitioners. Compared with ambulatory visit lengths for patients aged 45 to 64 years, average encounter times for 75-year-olds with family physicians were 0.8 minutes shorter, with general practitioners 1.2 minutes shorter, with internists 2.3 minutes shorter, and with cardiologists 3.0 minutes shorter. However, when all characteristics of the visit were considered, the effect of patient age remained significant only for general practitioners. A multivariate analysis of factors related to physician time for ambulatory care showed that more time is associated with multiple problems, problem severity, and the use of diagnostic testing. For general and family practice, the greater the number of previous visits for a problem, the shorter the encounter time is. Additional characteristics associated with shorter physician-patient encounter times include the volume of patients per week and the use of physician assistants within the practice. These findings have implications for medical education and manpower projections.\r"

The study found that diagnostic testing falls off significantly for patients 75 years of age or older and that internists use substantially more tests for each age group than do family and general practitioners.

Many reports indicate that anergy to ubiquitous antigens is common in the elderly. Recent studies suggest that anergy in the aged is not common when five or more antigens are used. Because it is often difficult to purchase singularly or apply a larger number of quality DCH antigens, we investigated the usefulness of the Multitest CMI in 29 nursing home residents with chronic diseases. This device simultaneously applies seven skin test antigens and a negative control. Ten young healthy subjects served as controls. DCH reactions were scored based on the sum of induration and total number of positive responses. Although elderly subjects had significantly lower scores than the young subjects, only 7% of elderly subjects were anergic. Our data indicate that the Multitest CMI is a highly effective device to test for DCH in geriatric subjects with chronic diseases. Although skin test responses in these subjects were blunted, in most residents cellular-mediated immunity remained intact.\r"

C. difficile was found in the stools of 30 (16.0%) of 187 infants who were screened. Increased length of stay in the nursery (P less than .001) and delivery by cesarian section (P less than .001) were associated with higher rates of colonization. The isolates initially detected from the environment and the infants were strain B1811-1700. Strain B1537/Cld7 became the predominant isolate obtained from the infants; positive cultures were also obtained from the environment and the hands of personnel who worked in the nursery and had strain B1537/Cld7. Our results suggest that the infants acquired C. difficile through transfer from the hands of hospital staff.\r"

Using stepwise discriminant analysis, we found the six factors that were most strongly associated with an unfavorable short-term outcome (respiratory failure or death): lymphopenia, advanced age, concomitant smear-positive extrapulmonary tuberculosis, alcoholism, a high percentage of neutrophils on the differential white blood cell count, and lack of radiographic evidence of cavitation. We derived a scoring system incorporating these variables and separated patients into high- and low-risk groups. The system was prospectively validated by applying it to a separate group of 179 patients. Lymphocyte-transformation tests in 32 patients revealed an association between clinical markers of poor prognosis and minimal lymphocyte proliferation to a heat-killed strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\r"

Lower detection rates were observed in HIV-seronegative (15%) and asymptomatic HIV-seropositive (16%) men. In the patients with diarrhea, 95% of the isolates of virus were found in the most immunosuppressed patients, those patients with AIDS-related complex or opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. High excretion rates of these viruses are probably associated with both anal-oral transmission and immunosuppression. These viruses apparently cause acute episodes or relapses of diarrhea in some patients but may be co-pathogens or noncontributory to chronic diarrhea in others.\r"

We found that 125I-labeled mucins demonstrated saturable Gal-specific binding to E. histolytica trophozoites (strain HM1:IMSS), with 2.8 x 10(3) binding sites per amoeba and a dissociation constant of 8.20 x 10(-11) M-1. Inhibition of parasite protein synthesis completely abrogated mucin binding; elevation of amoebic vesicle pH with ammonium chloride (10 mM) had no effect. Surface-bound 125I-labeled mucins were rapidly internalized and released from amoebae without evidence of proteolytic degradation. Three avirulent HM1 clones contained immunoreactive Gal/GalNAc lectin molecules with high-affinity binding of 125I-labeled mucins but exhibited markedly reduced rates of uptake and exocytosis of bound mucins. High-affinity binding by the Gal/GalNAc adherence lectin was followed by rapid internalization and eventual release of the colonic mucins. Additionally, defects in lectin surface expression and endocytosis were found in the avirulent clones.\r"

Respiratory tract deposition in infants, after they inhaled an aerosol containing 200 micrograms of ribavirin/L, was 1.8 mg/kg per hour; in adults the deposition was 0.9 mg/kg per hour. Adolescent females and older women have less (7%/kg) respiratory tract deposition than do males. Fever will increase deposition about 9%/degree Centigrade (5%/degree Fahrenheit) for each degree of increase above normal temperature. Tracheal intubation will deliver relatively more drug to the lung and no drug to the nasopharynx. Our report shows the regional and total deposition of inhaled ribavirin aerosol in the respiratory tracts of persons in different age-groups from three months to 25 y.\r"

Physicians consider blood lipid testing to be important in adults, but vary widely in their idea of what levels represent high risk for coronary heart disease. Over 40 percent felt that cholesterol levels need to be 7.80 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) or greater to constitute a high risk for coronary heart disease for patients aged 40 to 59 years. In addition, physicians feel much less effective in managing lipid abnormalities than in managing hypertension. Family physicians and general internists did not differ significantly in behavior or attitudes. To implement new expert recommendations, substantial efforts will be required to convince physicians to adopt lower cholesterol levels as indicating high risk for coronary heart disease and to feel more effective in patient management.\r"

One-year abstinence rates were confirmed by the measurement of expired carbon monoxide levels. One third of claimed abstainers were randomly selected at one-year follow-up for confirmation, with a resultant 3 percent deception rate. When this deception rate was applied to the overall results, six-month and 12-month abstinence rates became 36 percent and 29 percent, respectively.

Nine percent of these patients reported discovering a previously unknown condition as a result of their recent screening examination. The majority of surveyed patients said they would agree to be screened or treated with the complete list of eight suggested procedures for men and ten procedures for women. Rates of patient acceptance of specific health maintenance recommendations ranged from a low of 54 percent for influenza immunization to a high of 91 percent for a blood pressure check. Listing typical costs did not alter the selection rates of patients with insurance coverage compared with those without it. The geriatric age group was the least willing to be screened. Seventy-two percent of patients indicated that they wanted to discuss at least one wellness topic with their physician. Overall, most patients are willing to participate in the concept of a periodic health maintenance examination as recommended to them by their physician.\r"

An average of 10.4 calls per physician were received each day, and a mean of 16.2 minutes per physician was spent each day with telephone encounters. Each call was brief, lasting 1.6 minutes (standard deviation 1.5 minutes); administrative and personal calls each lasted significantly longer than other call categories (F = 20.8, P = .0001). More chronic disease diagnoses tended to be handled during office when compared with nonoffice telephone encounters. The majority of calls (932, or 83.1 percent) did not require a face-to-face visit as judged by the physician. Of the office calls, 58.2 percent were handled by the physicians through a message system rather than a direct physician telephone call.

This questionnaire study of 48 lithium outpatients evaluated the utility of Ajzen and Fishbein's Theory of Reasoned Action in explicating the relationships among lithium-related beliefs and attitudes, normative beliefs, behavioral intentions, and self-reported compliance with the treatment regimen. Results support the usefulness of this model, with some modification, in conceptualizing patients' compliance behaviors. Findings underscore the importance of the patient-physician relationship in lithium compliance.\r"

A stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that patients given higher levels of somatic therapy were significantly (p less than .001) more likely to be older and have depression with psychotic features and less likely to have compulsive personality disorders. These patients also had significantly longer hospitalizations. A separate stepwise regression analysis showed that patients given higher levels of somatic therapy had superior outcomes (p less than .001). The proportion of this sample given no antidepressant medication or electroconvulsive therapy (18.4%) and the proportion given \"adequate\" treatment (45.3% to 63.7%, depending on the criteria applied) were comparable to the findings of other published reports.\r"

Among these common or very common symptoms only eight were RDC endogenous symptoms, and two of these were obligatory inclusion criteria. The ADL revealed 22 nonendogenous symptoms (according to RDC) to be common or very common symptoms of patients with RDC endogenous depression. The core symptoms, depressed mood and loss of pleasure, appeared to be weakly correlated with each other. Of the remaining 28 common or very common symptoms, 12 correlated significantly with at least one of the core symptoms and 16 did not. Dexamethasone suppression test suppressors and nonsuppressors did not differ, either in symptomatology or in severity of the syndrome.\r"

Many patients referred to a depression clinic with other, generally less severe diagnoses were reevaluated by clinic staff and shown to meet DSM-III criteria for a major depressive episode. Discussions with referring therapists about these diagnostic discrepancies revealed frequent misconceptions about the diagnosis of major depression. In response to these observations, a questionnaire was devised to assess clinicians' knowledge about the DSM-III criteria for major depression. One hundred thirteen questionnaires were distributed to clinicians of varied disciplines and levels of experience, and 54 of these questionnaires were returned. Misconceptions about the DSM-III criteria for a major depressive episode were frequent among responders. The most common errors involved the incorrect assumption that vegetative signs and a distinct quality of mood are required for the diagnosis of major depression and that the diagnosis should not be made if chronic. Other major areas of confusion and potential causes of diagnostic error are discussed. Significantly, there were no differences in kind and number of errors when trainees and nontrainees were compared.\r"

Reliability and validity evidence is presented for scales labeled Demanding, Help Rejecting, Unreachable, Dangerous, and Poor Fit. Fifty-four psychiatric outpatients identified as difficult to treat by two or more therapists were compared with 54 control psychiatric outpatients matched on age, sex, marital status, and diagnosis. Therapists rated difficult patients higher on each scale. Patients rated higher on the Demanding, Help Rejecting, and Poor Fit scales were heavier and more varied users of the treatment system than were those rated lower on these scales. The scale helps identify causes of staff dissatisfaction and inappropriate organization of services and suggests how to meet the special needs of difficult patients. Problem patients can be seen as denying the competence and authority of the mental health professional but also as central to the unique mandate of psychiatry. The reward system should more adequately support those therapists who care for the patients often avoided by others.\r"

Cortisol levels alone did not distinguish PTSD from paranoid schizophrenia patients and norepinephrine levels alone did not distinguish PTSD from bipolar I, manic, patients. In further consideration of these findings, we have found that combining the values for the two systems in a norepinephrine/cortisol (N/C) ratio provides a measure that significantly distinguishes PTSD from all the other patient groups throughout the hospitalization period. The N/C ratio was more than twice as high in the PTSD group than in all the other patient groups in the first sample following hospital admission, in the mean sample during hospitalization, and in the last sample before discharge. The mean N/C ratio for the PTSD group was 2.54, compared with a mean of .99 for the other four groups, which ranged from .81 to 1.18. The diagnostic sensitivity was 78% and the specificity was 94% for correct classification of PTSD in our sample. These preliminary findings yield further encouragement for exploring multivariate strategies, using hormonal ratios or profiles, in an effort to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of neuroendocrine criteria in the assessment of psychiatric patients.\r"

There were significant increases in gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, cholesterol, and amylase activity and significant decreases in total serum protein, blood sugar, albumin, globulins, and cholinesterase in anorexia nervosa patients compared with normal control subjects. At discharge, these values slightly improved. Similar alterations were also observed in two other anorectic groups. Compared with anorexia nervosa patients, the two other anorectic groups showed a severe reduction in the albumin level and increase in the globulin level. In two other anorectic groups cholesterol levels were lower, and in the malignancy group cholinesterase level was lower than in the anorexia nervosa patients. In anorexia nervosa patients, biochemical abnormalities in the serum were more frequent in total serum protein (93%), blood sugar (85%), and globulins (78%) than in other serum factors, such as blood urea nitrogen (15%), uric acid (15%), and alkaline phosphatase (7%). These results suggest that detection of biochemical abnormalities in the above-mentioned serum factors in routine analyses would be valuable in making an early diagnosis of anorexia nervosa from various anorectic disorders.\r"

Campylobacter jejuni (14%) and cytomegalovirus (11%) were both significantly more frequently demonstrated in patients than controls. Serological evidence of recent infection with mycoplasma (1%), Epstein Barr virus (1-2%) and parvovirus B19 (4%) was also identified in the patients but not more frequently than in the controls.

One patient probably suffered a brainstem infarct at the time that the unilateral flush was first noticed, and was left with a subtle Horner's syndrome on the side opposite to the flush. The other four had no other neurological symptoms and no ocular signs of Horner's syndrome. Thermal and emotional flushing and sweating were found to be impaired on the non-flushing side of the forehead in all five patients whereas gustatory sweating and flushing were increased on that side in four of the five patients, a combination of signs indicating a deficit of the second sympathetic neuron at the level of the third thoracic segment. CT and MRI of this area failed to disclose a structural lesion but latency from stimulation of the motor cortex and thoracic spinal cord to the third intercostal muscle was delayed on the non-flushing side in one patient. The complaint of unilateral flushing and sweating was abolished in one patient by ipsilateral stellate ganglionectomy. The unilateral facial flushing and sweating induced by heat in all five patients was thus a normal or excessive response by an intact sympathetic pathway, the other side failing to respond because of a sympathetic deficit. The onset in the four cases of peripheral origin followed strenuous exertion, which suggested that an anterior radicular artery may have become occluded at the third thoracic segment during torsion of the thoracic spine.\r"

A period of 3 days intervened between testing each drug in the same individual. It was shown that basal prolactin levels in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and the controls did not differ significantly, whereas in the metoclopramide stimulation test seven amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients showed a very exaggerated response. The mean value of maximal prolactin increment was 1609.90% (SD 456) in comparison with the control group 638.3% (SD 89.7) (p less than 0.01). In the bromocriptine inhibition test the mean value of maximal prolactin percentage decrement was 50.4% (SD 6.1) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 66.5% (SD 5.3) in the controls and this difference was statistically insignificant. These data suggest that exaggerated prolactin response to metoclopramide in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be a result of a decreased activity of central dopaminergic neurons.\r"

The sensory action potential from the digital nerves of the index finger was recorded at wrist and elbow using bipolar electrodes with the \"active\" electrode over the median nerve and the \"reference\" placed 4 cm laterally or proximally along the nerve using interelectrode distances of 4, 3 and 2 cm. These potentials were compared with that recorded using a remote reference on the ipsilateral shoulder, the assumption being that this configuration eliminated the contribution of the reference electrode to the compound nerve action potential. With different electrode configurations, there were significant differences in the shape of the potential, the latencies to onset and peak and the rising- and falling-phase amplitudes. The shorter the distance between the electrodes the greater the distortions. Overall, the distortions were least with the 4 cm interelectrode separation, particularly for short conduction distances.\r"

  ".W": "Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 19 closed head injury (CHI) patients, at least 6 months after injury, and an equal number of control subjects, during a task requiring the covert counting of rare auditory \"target\" stimuli against a background of frequent \"non-targets\". In both groups, ERPs to targets contained enhanced frontal N2 and parietal P3 components. N2 was larger in amplitude in the CHI patients than in the controls, and its peak latency was delayed. P3 amplitude was smaller in the patients, but its latency was not significantly different from that of the control group. The delay in N2 latency is interpreted as evidence of an increase in the time needed to achieve stimulus categorisation in CHI patients. The larger N2s in this group are thought to reflect the additional cognitive effort required after CHI to cope with the task. The negative findings with respect to P3 latency suggest that this may be a less sensitive measure of information-processing efficiency in this task than the latency of N2.\r"

Following laminectomy for cervical radiculomyelopathy four patients were unchanged neurologically from their pre-operative examinations, but as they were raised into the upright position for the first time following surgery focal neurological deficits referrable to the spinal cord developed. Hypotension was present in all four cases during these episodes and three of the four patients had residual central cervical cord syndromes. These cases represent the first reported instances of spinal cord ischaemia occurring with post-operative hypotensive episodes after decompression for cervical spondylosis.\r"

Individuals born within the years 1892, 1904, 1909, 1918, 1919 and 1929 appear to have had an increased risk of developing idiopathic Parkinson's disease in later life. These years are close to those of the influenza pandemics of the period 1890-1930. The estimated risk of an individual developing idiopathic Parkinson's disease shows a significant correlation with the crude influenza mortality for the year of his birth, within the range 1900 to 1930. It is suggested that intra-uterine influenza may be cytotoxic to the developing foetal substantia nigra, and that an affected individual may be born without evident disability but with limited striatal neurochemical reserves and a reduced nigral cell count. In later life normal cellular involution with ageing or exposure to environmental neurotoxic factors may further erode these reserves to a level where the substantia nigra fails and idiopathic Parkinson's disease becomes clinically apparent.\r"

Baseline measurement of the ability to execute a given plan of action, to generate low level strategies required for efficient searching, and spatial working memory capacity, all of which contribute to performance on the planning task, established that the Parkinson's disease group was unimpaired on any of these measures. On the Tower of London task, the Parkinson's disease group was also unimpaired in terms of the average number of moves required to solve a problem. However, a specific planning deficit was evident when \"thinking\" times were analysed, and this was after the confounding influence of motor initiation and execution times had been carefully extracted from total performance times. This finding is discussed in relation to putative functions of the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, and an attention-switching hypothesis is developed to account for it.\r"

Twenty-nine bilateral facial nerve avulsion operations were performed with benefit in 27 cases; but recurrences appeared in 22, on average one year after surgery.

For 27 of the cases in these families full medical records were available, and a history of a further 37 affected family members were obtained. The cases in these 20 families are termed familial and the remainder sporadic. Parent to child transmission occurred in 16 of the 20 families of the familial cases, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. In three families there was involvement of siblings only, and in one family two cousins were affected. The sex ratio for the documented familial case records seen was 0.8:1 (M/F = 12:15), for the total (documented and historical) it was 1.06:1 (33:31), but in sporadic cases it was 1.6:1 (341:212) and more frequent occurrence of sensory features at presentation was reported in the familial cases (15% in the familial cases and 5% in the sporadic cases). However, none of these differences reached statistical significance. Familial cases also differed from sporadic cases in having a younger age of onset (a mean of 52 years in the familial cases compared with 56 years in the sporadic) and in the shorter median reported duration of illness (1.1 year in the familial cases; 2.6 years in the sporadic). However, in only one fifth of sporadic cases was the age at onset and death known, although this was known for 22 of the 27 familial cases, so that the data on survival and age of onset are too incomplete to test formally.\r"

Among the advantages of the technique are comparatively quick and easy sampling of adequate number of single motor end-plates, convenient control of discharge rate between less than 1 and up to 20 Hz, absence of direct muscle fibre responses, and little discomfort for the patient. The jitter in the orbicularis oculi is significantly lower than that in the extensor digitorum communis muscle. There is a positive correlation between the jitter and the latency of the individual muscle fibre responses, possibly indicating that smaller diameter muscle fibres have slightly lower safety factor of neuromuscular transmission. The data collected in a group of healthy volunteers suggest the following upper normal limits for the mean of absolute consecutive difference of the latency: 30 microseconds for individual motor end plates (one out of 20 values may be higher), and 18 microseconds for a median of 20 motor end plates.\r"

  ".W": "Antibodies against peripheral nerve myelin have previously been demonstrated in serum from patients with peripheral neuropathy and IgM paraproteinaemia, and a causal relationship has been suggested. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), anti-myelin antibodies were found in sera from eight of 16 patients with polyneuropathy and paraproteinaemia, but also in 17% of 109 patients with peripheral neuropathy lacking monoclonal immunoglobulin, including five of 10 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and in 16% of 142 blood donors. The antibodies were mostly of IgM class in the two neuropathy groups, while blood donors had mostly IgA antibodies, and a few subjects of each group had antimyelin antibodies of two different isotypes. Western blot confirmed the ELISA results in a majority of antibody positive sera and revealed a 25-30 kD myelin target antigen for sera from the three groups, and for some of the non-paraproteinaemic sera also a 100 kD myelin target antigen. Our results demonstrate that the presence of serum autoantibodies against peripheral nerve myelin does not necessarily indicate a pathological event.\r"

Subjects were videotaped during experimental procedures designed to elicit emotional facial expression and non-emotional facial movement (paralysis, mobility, praxis). On tasks of emotional facial expression, patients with right hemisphere pathology were less responsive and less appropriate than patients with left hemisphere pathology or normal controls. These results corroborate other research findings that the right cerebral hemisphere is dominant for the expression of facial emotion. Both brain-damaged groups had substantial facial paralysis and impairment in muscular mobility on the hemiface contralateral to site of lesion, and the left brain-damaged group had bucco-facial apraxia. Performance measures of emotional expression and non-emotional movement were uncorrelated, suggesting a dissociation between these two systems of facial behaviour.\r"

This suggests that the relationship between severity of disease and intellectual impairment was not an artifact of increasing depression. Severity of rigidity and of bradykinesia did predict severity of intellectual decline, but severity of tremor predicted better intellectual status. Patients with a predominance of tremor may have a more benign clinical course as well as better intellectual function than patients with a predominance of rigidity and bradykinesia.\r"

Fibre tract damage at the level of the fornix has only inconsistently produced amnesia. A patient is reported who suffered a cerebrovascular accident involving the posterior limb of the left internal capsule that resulted in a persistent and severe disorder of verbal memory. The inferior extent of the lesion effectively disconnected the mesial thalamus from the amygdala and the frontal cortex by disrupting the ventral amygdalofugal and thalamic-frontal pathways as they course through the diencephalon. This case demonstrates that an isolated lesion may cause memory loss without involvement of traditional structures associated with memory and may explain memory disturbances in other white matter disease such as multiple sclerosis and lacunar state.\r"

Patients surviving to surgery were divided into three groups according to the interval between preadmission SAH and surgery: 0 to 3 days (85 cases), 4 to 9 days (83 cases), and 10 or more days (50 cases). Of the patients who were categorized neurologically into Botterell Grades 1 and 2 (Hunt and Hess Grades I to III) on admission, 87% had an excellent or good result on follow-up evaluation. Patients undergoing surgery 0 to 3 days after SAH had a statistically significant increase in the incidence of postoperative ischemic symptoms (p less than 0.005), which was balanced by similar complications preoperatively in the 10-day post-SAH surgical group. Most rebleeds occurred before admission but delaying surgery did increase the risk of rebleeding in the hospital (p less than 0.0005). Management morbidity and mortality occurred primarily as a direct result of a severe initial hemorrhage; thus, the measured benefits of early surgery were less than might have been predicted.\r"

Angiographic differentiation between dissecting aneurysms and atherosclerotic fusiform aneurysms was difficult. The dissecting aneurysms were characterized by a \"narrowed segment\" proximal and/or distal to a \"fusiform dilatation\" of the affected artery and by the presence of contrast medium in the intramural false lumen until the late phase. Poor postoperative outcome and the lateral medullary syndrome were seen only in dissecting aneurysms.

The diagnosis of angiographically occult AVM was highly suspected preoperatively in each case based on the combination of computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) findings. The CT scans in all cases showed moderately hyperdense lesions which enhanced mildly or moderately in a nonhomogeneous pattern with administration of contrast material. The MR image showed one or more bright areas interspersed with areas of low or absent signal peripherally or centrally on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The AVM was totally excised in seven patients and partially excised in one patient, with favorable results in all. The clinical management and differential diagnosis of angiographically occult AVM's are discussed. In patients with a clinical course and radiological studies suggestive of an occult AVM, removal of the lesion, if accessible, should be performed in order to rule out a neoplasm and prevent subsequent hemorrhage and progression of symptoms.\r"

The procedure was initially effective in relieving pain in 80% of the patients with typical trigeminal neuralgia and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia secondary to multiple sclerosis. However, life-table analysis indicated that 50% of this group had persistence or recurrence of pain within 18 months after the operation. Percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis was ineffective in relieving atypical trigeminal neuralgia or atypical facial pain. Minor complications occurred in 23% of patients, and major morbidity was seen in 1.6%. Facial sensory loss which persisted for more than 1 month was found in 72% of patients, corneal hypesthesia occurred in 15%, and an additional 7% had corneal anesthesia. The data indicate that the success of percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis in relieving trigeminal neuralgia is directly related to the production of facial sensory loss.\r"
