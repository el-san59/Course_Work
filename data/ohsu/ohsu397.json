Twelve variables were shown to discriminate between compliers and non-compliers. Discriminating variables relating to patients included health state, employment state, knowledge of tablet, and perception of anxiety level, difficulty in complying, and their observed anger, distance, and assertiveness in the consultation. Discriminating variables relating to doctors included provision of advice on duration of treatment, complexity of dosage schedule, age of doctor, and number of years in practice. For the most part these results confirmed previous research. It is concluded that the doctor should consider both the dosage schedule and the patient's daily routine when prescribing antibiotic tablets. Advice on how to take the tablets should be given in specific rather than in general terms. The significant effect of the age of the doctor and the years spent in practice has not been found in previous work. This finding may reflect differences in behavior between younger doctors and their patients. This difference was not detected in the observation of consultation events.\r"

  ".W": "Records on 1546 children who were identified as having attended schools in Seascale up to November 1984 and were born since 1950 but not in the civil parish were studied. These children lived in or near Seascale for a period of time while they were attending one or more of three local schools and are an additional group to the 1068 children who were identified as born to mothers resident in Seascale in an accompanying study. Even though some of the schoolchildren apparently remained in the village for a short period only all but 7% were followed up through the National Health Service Central Register. Mortality among these children to 30 June 1986 is comparable to that expected at national rates. From all causes there were 10 observed deaths compared with 12.69 expected--a ratio of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.45)--and from cancer one observed death compared with 2.04 expected--a ratio of 0.49 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.73). No deaths from leukaemia or lymphoma were reported, but only 0.83 was expected. Since 1971 (the year when cases of cancer were first notified to the NHS Central Register) three non-fatal cases of cancer were reported, including two lymphomas, compared with 2.04 expected and two cases of carcinoma in situ of the cervix compared with 1.79 expected. In addition, there was a case of leukaemia among the schoolchildren which was known previously and had been diagnosed in 1968. There is an interesting difference between the results of this study and the results of the study of children born to mothers who were resident in Seascale. In the latter study there was an excess of leukaemia and of other cancers, but a similar finding is not apparent among children who spent some time at schools in Seascale but were born elsewhere. This raises the question of whether one or more aetiological factors in childhood cancer were acting on a locality specific basis before birth or early in life. This cannot be answered from these cohort studies, but it is hoped that the case-control study that is under way in West Cumbria will provide relevant information.\r"

  ".W": "Records on 1068 children who were born to mothers resident in Seascale Civil Parish during 1950-83 were studied. There was a large degree of mobility among the families, and nearly half of the children did not subsequently attend the main local school. Use of the National Health Service Central Register, however, enabled us to follow up the children's records regardless of place of residence. The excess of leukaemia among Seascale children first supported from the analysis of geographical areas is confirmed. There were five deaths from leukaemia identified to 30 June 1986 compared with 0.53 expected at national rates--a ratio of 9.36 (95% confidence interval 3.04 to 21.84). One of these deaths occurred after the child had left Seascale. There were four deaths from other cancers compared with 1.06 expected--a ratio of 3.76 (95% CI 1.02 to 9.63). In addition, three further cases of cancer, apart from the deaths, were reported compared with 1.19 expected since 1971--a ratio of 2.53 (95% CI 0.52 to 7.40). For other causes of death, including stillbirths and infant mortality, there was a reported deficit compared with national rates, some of which at least was to be expected on the basis of the social class composition of the population of Seascale. In view of the importance of this cohort of births continued follow up is planned, with the possibility of extending it to include births since 1983, and the methods available for this type of study will be examined further.\r"

A common concern is that the approximate costs used are unfair to those authorities (typically those with teaching hospitals) that are likely to treat more complex cases. This paper argues that when spending exceeds the target allowance for acute services this is more likely to be due to district residents using services at a high rate than to inadequate compensation for inflows. Districts where residents make a high use of services are often those where there are large flows across district boundaries. Since authorities cannot control outflows there is little they can do to reduce their residents' high use of services. Furthermore, curious financial incentives can be inferred for clinicians in these districts if they were to take effective action to bring their district's spending to target levels. These problems are discussed to illuminate problems of accounting for cross boundary flows that alternatives to current practice must resolve.\r"

Two thirds of the patients had been resistant or minimally responsive to combination chemotherapy. Complete remission was obtained in five patients (two with prolymphocytic leukaemia and one each with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, adult T cell leukaemia-lymphoma, and Sezary syndrome) and partial remission in two others. Unmaintained complete remission lasting more than one year was seen in three patients. Responses were obtained only in patients with CD4+,CD8-membrane markers (seven out of 10), and no responses were recorded in any of the nine patients with a different phenotype. In this series remission appeared to correlate with the membrane phenotype of the neoplastic cell and not with the cytopathological diagnosis. Future studies should establish the biochemical basis for the greater sensitivity of CD4+ lymphoid cells to deoxycoformycin.\r"

  ".W": "Relative mortality in the period 1970-80 was studied among Danish men and women who were unemployed and employed on the day of the 1970 census. The study population consisted of the total labour force in the age range 20-64 on 9 November 1970--that is, about 2 million employed and 22,000 unemployed people. Relative mortality was analysed by a multiplicative hazard regression model (as a natural extension of the standardised mortality ratio) and a multiplicative regression model with extra-Poisson variation. A significantly increased death rate (40-50%) was found among the unemployed after adjusting for occupation, housing category, geographical region, and marital state. Analysis of five main causes of death showed increased mortality from all causes, but especially from suicide or accidents. In areas where the local unemployment rate was comparatively high the relative mortality among the unemployed was lower. The increased mortality among the unemployed was interpreted as a consequence of health related selection as well as increased susceptibility associated with the psychosocial stress of unemployment.\r"

Comparison of linear analogue scales of patients' satisfaction with the availability of their chosen doctor showed no significant difference between job sharing partners and full time partners. Nevertheless, significantly fewer patients were able to see the full time partner of their choice within two days than were able to see the job sharing partner of their choice within the same period. In this study patients were as satisfied with the availability of job sharing partners as they were with that of full time partners; the findings highlight important considerations for practices wishing to appoint partners with a limited commitment.\r"

An overall success rate of 91.8% was achieved (stone free or less than 2 mm fragments at three months) and for stones measuring 1 cm 96.3%. Lithotripsy produced extremely low morbidity, and no deaths have occurred at the clinic. Patients who had lithotripsy alone had a mean hospital stay of three days and in most instances were able to perform their full range of activities on discharge. Planned combination of lithotripsy with minimally invasive endourological procedures such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ureterorenoscopy has allowed us to extend the range of treatable cases to include large stones. Prophylactic use of Double-J ureteric stents in selected cases has reduced the incidence of obstruction by stone fragments after lithotripsy, thereby decreasing morbidity and hospital stay.\r"

Death was caused by problems of preterm birth in 68 cases. No specific cause could be found for 34 deaths. Improvement in the quality of obstetric care might substantially reduce both fetal and neonatal death rates.\r"

The previous paper in this series examined problems for an inner city district health authority arising from RAWP cross boundary flow adjustment. This paper examines the likely importance of these and other problems for the National Health Service as a whole. Cross charging has been proposed as an alternative method of funding flows. District health authorities would receive an allocation equivalent to their RAWP target and then all non-emergency flows would be agreed between the authorities where patients live and competing authorities offering treatment at previously negotiated charges based on local estimates of each type of case. The problem of cost estimation is usually cited as a difficulty with this proposed reform, but this paper also discusses other important issues that tend to be neglected.\r"

Mortality was studied among 2547 adult asthmatics attending a national sample of 60 general practices between 1970 and 1976; they were compared with a matched group of non-asthmatic patients. Mortality from all causes was significantly raised in the asthmatic cohort (189 deaths v 112 among controls; relative risk 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.0), especially in women (92 v 42 deaths; relative risk 2.2 (1.5 to 3.1)), and in the oldest age group (55-59 years). In both sexes the predominant cause of excess mortality was respiratory disease, particularly asthma (25 v 0 deaths) and chronic obstructive airways disease (37 v 4 deaths; relative risk 8.8 (2.8 to 23)). Overall, 94% of the asthmatic cohort survived the mean follow up period of eight years compared with 96% of the controls. In contrast to previous findings, the risk of death due to malignant neoplasms was not significantly reduced overall (34 v 36 deaths), though the risk was significantly reduced among those aged under 45 years (2 v 10 deaths; relative risk 0.2 (0.02 to 0.9)) and there was a significant trend of lowering of relative risk with younger age (p less than 0.01).\r"

  ".W": "Patients treated for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have a better prognosis than other patients with cancer so may have a lower prevalence of psychological and social morbidity. Trained interviewers used standardised methods to assess 90 patients at a mean of 32 months after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy had commonly caused adverse effects including hair loss, vomiting, nausea, and loss of appetite. Although most patients were free of disease and not receiving treatment at follow up, some still suffered from a lack of energy (31 patients), loss of libido (19), irritability (22), and tiredness (19); 30 patients complained of continued impairment of thinking or disturbance of short term memory. After diagnosis 21 patients had suffered from an anxiety state or depressive illness, or both, while 27 had experienced borderline anxiety or depression, or both. Mood disturbance was positively correlated with adverse effects of treatment, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Social adjustment was less affected, but failure to return to work, or a long delay in returning to work, and a persistent lack of interest in leisure activities gave cause for concern. These findings of substantial psychiatric and social morbidity in patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma prompted a prospective study of these patients to determine their nature and duration.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of 120 patients newly diagnosed as having Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was conducted to determine the nature, extent, and timing of the psychiatric and social morbidity associated with the diagnosis and treatment. Patients were interviewed at diagnosis and two, six, and 12 months later by trained interviewers using standardised questionnaires. Psychiatric morbidity was greatest in the three months before treatment, but new episodes of anxiety and depression developed throughout the year of follow up. Altogether 39 patients suffered a depressive illness or anxiety state, or both, and a further 37 experienced borderline anxiety or depression, or both, during the 15 months of assessment. The most common adverse effects of treatment were hair loss, nausea, vomiting, sore mouth, and changes in perception of taste. Toxicity of treatment was associated with psychiatric morbidity. Conditioned responses to chemotherapy were experienced by 32 patients. Social morbidity was low, although difficulties in returning to work and to previous levels of leisure activity were noted. Although most patients were no longer receiving treatment and were free of disease at the one year follow up, 51 patients continued to complain of loss of energy, 24 of loss of libido, 38 of tiredness, 23 of irritability, 18 of poor concentration, and 23 of memory impairment. These results confirm our retrospective study and suggest that a high price is paid for long term survival by a substantial proportion of patients receiving treatment for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "About 5% of all National Health Service prescriptions in Britain and a quarter of reports of suspected adverse reactions are accounted for by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Their prescription was investigated in two computerised group practices serving 11850 patients. Altogether 198 patients receiving repeat prescriptions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were identified and relevant clinical details extracted from their notes. Of these patients, 119 were over 65 years old; 172 were receiving one of six different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and 76 were taking drugs that can interact with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Ninety one patients had one or more medical conditions that may be aggravated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 36 had experienced side effects important enough for their treatment to be changed. A questionnaire to assess opinions and knowledge of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was given to 42 general practitioners and 26 rheumatologists. Although the two groups showed a comparable knowledge of the properties and costs of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, they differed significantly in their views on the circumstances under which these drugs should be used. Clear guidelines on the prescription of these drugs would indicate when careful monitoring is essential for patients to benefit from them safely.\r"

The outcomes of the changes made were assessed against the aims of the service by using data from the Hospital Activity Analysis, SH3 returns, government population estimates, and yearly figures collected in our department.

RAWP intended the medical service increment for teaching (SIFT) to cover these costs. Although it is not possible to assess from the methods used to derive the SIFT rate whether it is or is not overgenerous for its intended purpose, the \"excellence\" elements of teaching hospitals tend to be protected. The financial problems of the teaching hospitals are more likely to be due to the relatively high use of services by local residents. But cutting services of London teaching hospitals to bring this use down to equitable levels may impair their capacity to train medical students.\r"

  ".W": "Through immunohistochemical techniques, blood coagulation factors were identified in situ in fresh frozen sections of small cell carcinoma of the lung. Prothrombin/thrombin, factor VII, factor X, and antithrombin III were present in intercellular spaces and associated with tumor cells. Factor IX, factor XI, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen were identified as being associated with tumor cells but did not exist in intercellular spaces. Variable connective tissue staining but no tumor-related staining was observed for factor V, factor VIII-related antigen, factor XII, the B subunit of factor XIII, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, or alpha 2-antiplasmin. Neither consecutive tissue nor the tumor manifested platelet Ib and IIbIIIa surface glycoproteins. These divergent staining patterns suggested that the detected clotting factors had not merely diffused from permeabilized blood vessels, but were selectively localized in situ. While conditions may exist within tumor tissue that both retard and promote thrombin generation, we propose that interactions between the observed coagulation factors ultimately lead to local thrombin formation, which is responsible for the conspicuous fibrin deposits already described in small cell carcinoma of the lung. Thrombin formed locally might contribute to progression of this tumor. Inhibition of local thrombin formation by warfarin therapy could explain the beneficial effects of warfarin therapy in treating small cell carcinoma of the lung.\r"

Eighteen lymph nodes representing a variety of reactive hyperplasias and B-cell neoplasms were analyzed with the ELISA and submitted for B- and T-cell gene rearrangement studies at the CT beta, JH and J kappa (JK) loci. In all 18 specimens, there was agreement in the results of the ELISA, the histologic diagnoses, and the results of gene rearrangement studies. In three of the B-cell lymphomas identified by histologic, ELISA, and DNA studies, surface marker phenotyping by flow cytometry did not indicate the presence of a monoclonal cell population. It is concluded that the ELISA correlates well with DNA gene rearrangement studies and is a rapid, simple, and accurate method for identifying lymph nodes containing monoclonal immunoglobulin. Moreover, it is proposed that the ELISA has certain advantages over other methods for determining light chain clonality in clinical specimens, and it is therefore useful to distinguish between benign lymphoid hyperplasia and monoclonal B-cell neoplasms.\r"

Serum prolactin and growth hormone levels determined by radioimmunoassay were similar in the two groups, but the patients showed a significant elevation in bioactive lactogenic hormones (prolactin plus growth hormone) as determined by the Nb2 rat lymphoma cell bioassay (P less than 0.001). The radioimmunoassayable prolactin levels in breast fluid were extremely variable; there was a trend towards higher concentrations in the cystic breast disease patients, but this just failed to achieve statistical significance (P = 0.06). Immunoreactive growth hormone was rarely detected in nipple aspirates obtained from either the patient or control groups. The mean breast fluid bioactive lactogenic hormone level was significantly higher in the cystic breast disease patients than in the normal controls (P less than 0.001); also ten of 46 (22%) controls, but only two of 36 (6%) patients had no detectable bioactivity. It is concluded that lactogenic hormone bioactivity, when assessed by the Nb2 cell assay, is indicative of an endocrine abnormality which is associated with benign breast disease, and is reflected in breast duct fluid, but is not identified by the conventional radioimmunoassays.\r"

Administration of 638-micrograms single or multiple doses 2 to 3 weeks before DMBA induced a 75% to 85% reduction in cancer incidence after 1 year (P less than 0.001). When treatment was begun 2 weeks after DMBA, 1.0 microgram/d infused for 84 days resulted in a 44% reduction in incidence, with higher-dose, more prolonged therapy achieving a 73% reduction, equal to the reduction in carcinoma incidence observed after ovariectomy. Biopsies of nontumorous mammary glands showed a positive correlation between prelactational lobuloalveolar hyperplasia, hormone dose, and reduction in incidence of mammary carcinoma. Similar treatment with 17-alpha-ethinyl-estradiol-17B and diethylstilbestrol did not inhibit the 90% to 100% incidence of carcinoma observed in DMBA-treated control rats, and induced lactational hyperplasia in mammary gland biopsies. Continuous ethinyl estriol infusion subcutaneous (sc) in 2.5 to 7.5 micrograms daily dosage significantly increased uterine weights by as much as 10% to 46% after 2 to 4 weeks. At the time of mammary neoplasm development when rats were necropsied, no significant difference was observed in uterine weights between rats receiving 638 micrograms/mo in a readily soluble pellet implant, and uterine weights of control rats. Ethinyl estriol given seven times monthly in 638-micrograms bolus doses was more inhibitory of mammary carcinogenesis than estriol after a year (P less than 0.1 greater than 0.05). Short-term intermittent administration of ethinyl estriol to young nulliparous women may offer a method of simulating the differentiating effect of pregnancy on mammary tissues, increasing durable resistance to carcinogenesis.\r"

The planned dose was 1 mg (28 X 10(6) mu)/ms daily for 5 days, followed by 0.5 mg/m2 three times a week for 3 weeks or until progression, whichever was first. Eight patients were fully evaluable, and there were no responses. In four of the eight, the disease remained stable for 1 month, and four progressed before this time. Toxic reactions included pyrexia, headache, and malaise, which were mild to moderate. Ten patients subsequently received conventional chemotherapy, which resulted in three complete and four partial responses. The mean duration of response to chemotherapy was 8 months. It is concluded that r-interferon-gamma, at the dose and schedule used, has no significant clinical activity in small cell lung carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanism of coronary spasm was examined regarding endothelium-related relaxation and contraction produced by smooth muscle cells of spastic vessels isolated from Gottingen miniature pigs. In these pigs, coronary artery spasm was documented angiographically in vivo three months after endothelial denudation, and spastic and control segments of the coronary artery were suspended in organ chambers at their optimal length for generating tension. Applications of KCl (118 mM), acetylcholine(10(-9) to 10(-4) M), and PGF2 alpha (10(-8) to 3 X 10(-5) M) produced similar tension, at the respective doses, in both the spastic and control coronary arteries. During increasing concentrations of histamine (10(-8) to 3 X 10(-4) M; n = 14) and serotonin (10(-9) to 10(-5) M; n = 13), the maximum tension of the spastic vessel was 136 +/- 6 and 97 +/- 4%, respectively, of the tension produced by 118 mM KCl. That is significantly larger than seen in the control vessels: 98 +/- 4 and 74 +/- 4%, respectively. The ED50 to histamine and serotonin was also significantly less in the spastic vessels. After mechanical removal of the endothelium, the tension generated during the cumulative administration of histamine (n = 8) but not serotonin (n = 8) was larger in the spastic than the control vessels, thereby suggesting the presence of augmented responses of the smooth muscle to histamine in the spastic vessels. The increase in maximum tension after mechanical denudation was greater in the control than the spastic vessels in cases of histamine and serotonin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the movements of Ca2+ into the myocardium from the extracellular space during the course of muscle contraction. Equilibration of the rabbit right ventricular wall with perfusate containing 45Ca was measured by collecting effluent droplets over time. This protocol was carried out in a quiescent muscle and then repeated 15-20 minutes later in an identical fashion except that halfway through the collection period the muscle was stimulated to contract. We were thus able to quantitate the contraction-dependent changes in 45Ca movements. In control experiments using [58Co]EDTA as an extracellular space marker, we observed that contraction altered the volume of this space. This alteration in extracellular space was relatively small, and the quantitation of 45Ca movements was corrected for this change. The addition of 1 microM Bay K 8644 to the perfusate stimulated tension and augmented Ca2+ depletion from the extracellular space. The addition of 15 microM nifedipine to the perfusate significantly reduced both tension development and Ca2+ depletion from the extracellular space of the muscle. Net contraction-dependent movement of Ca2+ from the extracellular space into the myocardium under control conditions at 1 mM [Ca2+] was 10-14 mumol Ca2+/kg tissue wet wt/beat. This value indicates either a large contribution of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and/or significant contribution of sarcolemmal bound Ca2+ to excitation-contraction coupling in the rabbit ventricle.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in endothelium-dependent, sodium pump-mediated, and calcium-dependent responses of vascular smooth muscle were investigated in 5-7-, 24-26-, and 50-52-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Age-dependent changes in systolic blood pressure were also determined. Although systolic blood pressure increased significantly with age, rats in all 3 age groups were considered normotensive. Initial studies on the passive force-response characteristics of strips of aortic and femoral arterial smooth muscle revealed that the level of passive force required for maximum active tension generation increased with increasing age. Subsequent studies were carried out using optimum passive force requirements. Endothelium-dependent relaxations of aortic smooth muscle induced by acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187 decreased significantly with increasing age. An age-dependent decrease in the contractile response of aortic smooth muscle to ouabain and potassium-free physiological salt solution (PSS) was observed. Potassium relaxation of femoral smooth muscle following contraction to norepinephrine (NE) in a potassium-free PSS was also significantly attenuated with increasing age. No age-related alterations in calcium sensitivity (in the presence of 10(-7) M NE) or calcium relaxation (membrane stabilization) of femoral arterial smooth muscle was seen. These results show that endothelium-dependent and sodium pump-mediated responses are reduced in vascular smooth muscle of the rat with increasing age. However, no changes in calcium-dependent responses are apparent. These observations are discussed in relation to the vascular changes observed in hypertension.\r"

The theta an may therefore be considered to demarcate exercise intensity into moderate (below) and heavy (above) domains. O2 uptake (VO2) responds with linear first-order dynamics for sub-theta an power outputs with a time constant of approximately equal to 25 to 35 sec and a \"delay\" of 15 to 20 sec. A steady state is therefore normally achieved within 3 min. For supra-theta an exercise an additional, slower component of VO2 delays the steady state (if attainable). This slow phase of the VO2 response causes the VO2 to rise to values above the steady-state level attainable by fitter subjects at that work rate. The magnitude of this \"excess\" VO2 correlates highly with the increased arterial blood lactate [L-] and becomes marked when [L-] exceeds 4 to 5 meq/liter. The theta an may therefore be considered a crucial index for sustainable physical activity that is not--or is modestly--fatiguing.\r"

In this study the influence of age on the responsiveness of medium-sized veins to local infusions of nitroglycerin was studied in two groups of 15 healthy male volunteers using the dorsal hand vein compliance technique. A dorsal hand vein was preconstricted with submaximally effective doses of phenylephrine and a dose-response curve with nitroglycerin was established. The nitroglycerin dose that caused a 50% venodilation ranged from 0.7 to 22.4 ng/min (geometric mean 3.6 ng/min) in the younger group (aged 19 to 29 years; mean +/- SD 23 +/- 3 years) and from 0.2 to 17.9 ng/min (geometric mean 3.6 ng/min) in the older subjects (aged 50 to 74 years; mean +/- SD 63 +/- 7 years) (P = 0.49 between geometric means). The mean (+/- SD) maximal venodilation, based on the pretreatment baseline, was 103% +/- 65% in the younger and 125% +/- 64% in the older subjects (P = 0.18). These results indicate that there is no age-related change in venous responsiveness to nitroglycerin.\r"

To determine the influence of loss of atrioventricular synchrony on release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma ANP concentrations were measured by radioreceptor assay in 16 patients during sequential and ventricular cardiac pacing at normal heart rates. 2. Ventricular pacing induced an increase in plasma ANP concentrations (means +/- SEM) from 44 +/- 3 to 104 +/- 4 pmol/l (P less than 0.01) in 11 patients in whom systemic blood pressure was maintained. 3. In contrast, when ventricular pacing was associated with a fall in blood pressure (five patients), ANP levels (means +/- SEM) fell from 68 +/- 6 to 14 +/- 4 pmol/l (n = 5, P less than 0.05) within 5 min, despite an increase in atrial pressure. Plasma catecholamines also rose significantly in these latter patients. 4. We conclude that when loss of atrioventricular synchrony is well tolerated haemodynamically, cardiac release of ANP is increased in keeping with elevation in atrial pressure. However, the fall in plasma ANP concentration observed when ventricular pacing produces a fall in blood pressure suggests that in addition to atrial pressure, ANP release may be influenced by negative feedback mechanisms, possibly involving the baroreflex and autonomic nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in weight and body content of protein, carbohydrate, fat, total body water, intra- and extracellular water, Na, and K were estimated from balance measurements in malnourished adult patients receiving total parenteral nutrition for consecutive 8-day periods, containing either a low or high carbohydrate content. Total caloric intake was 65% of energy expenditure on the low intake and 119% on the high intake, with a difference of 54% due entirely to carbohydrate. Although there are many assumptions and approximations necessarily involved in multiple balance studies, the accuracy is sufficient to produce useful information in short-term studies of this type. It is particularly useful in looking at differences between diets, since most of the methodologic errors cancel out. The effect of the increased glucose intake was to significantly increase storage, or decrease loss, of fat, carbohydrate, protein, intracellular water, and K. Changes in Na and extracellular water varied widely among patients, but were not affected by the increase in glucose. Most of the increase in K content (83%) was associated with glycogen deposition; a much smaller amount (17%) was associated with protein deposition. Thus, the ratio of K/N deposited (15 mEq of K:1 g of N) was very different from the 3:1 ratio seen in most tissues. Changes in any one constituent of body cell mass may not, therefore, be good indicators of changes in another. Since protein is the most important active component of body cell mass, changes in body cell mass components other than N should be interpreted with caution when used as indices of nutritional therapy.\r"

Embolization of the left coronary artery with 50-microns microspheres resulted in deterioration of left ventricular function, as indicated by increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure, while cardiac output decreased. During hypocapnia with left ventricular failure, the central hemodynamics remained unchanged, while a minor but nonsignificant decrease in myocardial blood flow was observed. Hypercapnia aggravated the heart failure, as indicated by increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure; however, the pump function of the heart was unchanged, as demonstrated by the unaltered cardiac output, heart rate, and mean aortic blood pressure. The changes in the central hemodynamics were reversed when pH was normalized during hypercapnia. Thus, in the present study pH, and not PaCO2, was responsible for the hemodynamic deterioration observed during hypercapnia in the failing heart.\r"

Piglets were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated. Pulmonary hypertension was induced by an iv infusion of group B Streptococci. Piglets were then divided into three groups with group B Streptococci infusion ongoing. Neither PAP nor the pulmonary vascular resistance index was decreased significantly by either NP or NG. NP decreased significantly both mean aortic pressure and the systemic vascular resistance index. Cardiac index decreased significantly during both NG and placebo infusion. These data suggest that neither NP nor NG is likely to be beneficial in sepsis-induced pulmonary hypertension in newborns.\r"

There were no significant changes in VDan with increases in respiratory frequency (f) or tidal volume (VT). The VDphys increased (mean change +0.153 L, p less than 0.05) with increase in VT (mean increase +0.84 L, p less than 0.01), but did not alter significantly with a twofold increase in f, at control VT. Increase in VT significantly reduced VD/VT (mean change -10.4 percent, p less than 0.05), but increase in f, at control VT, did not significantly alter VD/VT. These results indicate that in normal subjects, increase in VT alters ventilation/perfusion matching in the lungs, whereas an increase in f, at constant VT, has no effect on ventilation/perfusion matching. Increases in VD/VT cannot, therefore, be ascribed to alterations in ventilatory pattern where either VT, or f, or both are increased.\r"

  ".U": "88054422\r", 
  ".W": "In 20 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and secondary failure to sulfonylurea, a double-blind randomized study was performed comparing two regimes: insulin plus placebo (IP) and insulin plus glyburide (IG). The protocol included two hospitalization periods (days 1-18 and 78-85) and follow-up at the outpatient clinic for 325 days. The metabolic control was kept as tight as possible. The subjects underwent normoglycemic clamp studies and meal tests with determination of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, somatostatin, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide in plasma. On IG, they demonstrated marked and long-lasting improvement of metabolic control: HbA1c decreased from 11.1 +/- 0.3% on day 3 to 8.3 +/- 0.4% (P less than .001) on day 78 and 9.1 +/- 0.5% (P less than .001) on day 325. In subjects on IP, the corresponding values were 10.3 +/- 0.5, 8.4 +/- 0.4 (P less than .001), and 8.9 +/- 0.5% (P less than .05). Body weight increased by 6.0 +/- 1.5 kg (P less than .005) on IG and 2.9 +/- 2.1 kg (NS) on IP. The daily insulin requirement decreased on IG from 62.5 +/- 12.9 U/day on day 7 to 33.5 +/- 8.8 U/day on day 83 and 34.6 +/- 8.9 U/day on day 325. On IP the insulin requirement was almost constant: 62.0 +/- 10.7 U/day on day 7, 55.5 +/- 7.7 U/day on day 83, and 54.7 +/- 7.9 U/day on day 325. Insulin sensitivity measured with the hyperinsulinemic clamp (plasma insulin approximately equal to 130 microU/ml) was similar on IP and IG at the initiation of the study and was unchanged on days 18 and 85. A key observation of this study, although the mechanism is unclear, is that isoglycemic-meal-related insulin requirement was diminished by insulin treatment, indicating improvement of meal-related insulin sensitivity. Glyburide increased basal and meal-but not glucagon-stimulated insulin and C-peptide levels, and also augmented the effect of meals on somatostatin release. We conclude that in NIDDM, IG regime promptly and continuously decreased insulin requirement and improved metabolic control. This effect is, at least during the first 3 mo, mainly due to enhanced insulin secretion. IG and IP treatment had no effect on insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinemic-normoglycemic clamp, whereas meal-related insulin sensitivity was augmented.\r"

The article primarily focuses on how tolerance is defined, what biochemical mechanisms are involved when this condition occurs, which agents have been associated with the development of tolerance, and what can be done to prevent or reverse the condition in patients taking nitrates for ischemic heart disease. From a historical perspective, tolerance to organic nitrates has been a recognized phenomenon since the last century. The role that blood-level determinations and nitroglycerin pharmacokinetics have in the development of tolerance is discussed, and an extensive overview of currently marketed organic nitrate preparations and a few others available only through approved investigational protocols is presented. The role of cross-tolerance is discussed as is the role that nitrate-free intervals play in partially or completely reversing the effects of tolerance during chronic nitrate therapy. Additionally, a discussion of which specific nitrate formulation are least likely to have tolerance associated with their use is included, such as short-acting nitrate formulations with the exception of the intravenous dosage form. Finally, buccal nitroglycerin is presented as another new formulation that appears to be associated with minimal tolerance in studies already completed.\r"

  ".W": "In euthyroid rats, repetitive bolus injections of 0.1, 1, or 5 micrograms/100 g BW TRH every 15 min for 2 h produced a biphasic rise in the plasma TSH concentration. After an initial peak at 15 min, plasma TSH fell at 60 min to a nadir 50-80% of the 15-min peak, then rose again by 90 min to a plateau with approximately the same amplitude as the initial peak. Plasma TSH remained at this level until TRH injections were stopped at 2 h, then fell to the pre-TRH baseline by 3 h. A similar biphasic rise in plasma TSH was produced by constant infusion of 0.01, 0.1, or 1 microgram/min TRH for 3 h. If the dose of bolus TRH injected was increased at 45 min, the dip in plasma TSH at 60 min was significantly decreased. A single iv injection of 1 microgram/100 g BW T4 immediately or 4 h before the bolus TRH injections did not abolish the biphasic TSH response. However, the T4 injection 4 h before TRH significantly attenuated the amplitude of the TSH response. In hypothyroid rats, either repetitive bolus injections or constant infusion of TRH induced only a single peak of plasma TSH at 15-30 min, after which plasma TSH fell to and remained at the pre-TRH baseline. If the hypothyroid rats were injected with 2 micrograms/100 g BW T4 for 4 days before TRH bolus injections, a biphasic TSH response to continual TRH, identical to that in euthyroid rats, was produced. The pituitary TSH content of the hypothyroid rats was significantly subnormal. T4 treatment for 4 days restored both plasma and pituitary TSH levels to the euthyroid range. Our data indicate that 1) constant or repetitive exposure to TRH induces a biphasic rise in plasma TSH in euthyroid, but not in hypothyroid, rats; 2) this biphasic phenomenon is not produced by negative feedback of T4 on the thyrotroph; and 3) the rapid development of refractoriness to TRH in hypothyroid rats is not dependent on continuous exposure to a constant concentration of TRH, but may be related to the reduced TSH content of the hypothyroid thyrotroph.\r"

An acute injection of 0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 microgram CTPG (anorectin; 60, 150, or 300 pmol) into the third ventricle produced a significant dose-related reduction in food intake in the hungry rat during the 12-h dark period. Water intake was suppressed 30% by 1.0 microgram (300 pmol), but the lower doses had no effect. The highest dose (1 microgram or 300 pmol) produced a small rise in glucose concentration 5 min after injection into the third ventricle, which returned to the control value by 15 min. Anorectin increased the sympathetic efferent firing rate 3, 6, and 24 h after a single injection. Intraperitoneal injection of 2.0, 5.0, and 20 micrograms, however, had no significant effect on food or water intake. Chronic infusion into the third ventricle at a rate of 50 ng/h for 7 days produced a persistent reduction in food intake and a steady fall in body weight. The chronically infused rats had a significantly higher level of sympathetic activity, as measured by the firing rate of sympathetic nerves innervating the interscapular brown adipose tissue. These studies raise the possibility that anorectin released during processing of GRF might be involved in the modulation of feeding behavior.\r"

We have examined rat MHC (RT1) class II antigen gene regulation in 1B-6 cells, cloned in our laboratory from the Fisher rat thyroid line FRT-L5. 1B-6 cells are TSH dependent for growth and proliferation, and are responsive to more than 5 microU/ml bovine TSH (bTSH) in terms of extracellular cAMP accumulation. Recombinant rat gamma interferon (gamma IF; 1-1000 U/ml) treatment for 5 days together with bTSH (10(3) microU/ml) was able to induce class II antigen expression in up to 90% of 1B-6 cells, as detected by a murine monoclonal antibody to rat MHC class II antigen (FITC-OX-6). Total cellular RNA was examined in Northern blot analyses using an HLA-DR alpha-chain-specific RNA probe, which shares 78% sequence homology with the rat RT1.D alpha-chain gene. A 1.4-kilobase mRNA transcript was detected in gamma IF-stimulated cells, but not in untreated cells. Dose-response studies of MHC class II gene expression, using a cytoplasmic RNA slot blot technique for alpha-chain mRNA levels and FITC-OX 6 monoclonal antibody for detection of MHC class II antigen expression, indicated 1B-6 sensitivity to gamma IF in the range of 10-100 U/ml (in the presence of 10(3) microU/ml bTSH) and to bTSH in the range of 10-100 microU/ml (in the presence of 10(2) U/ml gamma IF). These data demonstrate dual control of MHC class II antigen gene expression by gamma IF and bTSH in a differentiated rat thyroid cell. Clone 1B-6 represents a powerful means of analyzing reproducibly and in long term studies the regulation of thyroid cell MHC class II gene expression.\r"

The free radical scavengers (i.e. cuprozinc cytosolic and mangano mitochondrial superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase), mitochondrial oxidative marker enzymes (cytochrome c oxidase and fumarase), and lipid peroxide were measured in liver, heart, soleus (slow oxidative), and extensor digitorum longus (fast glycolytic) muscles. Rats were rendered hyper- or hypothyroid for 4 weeks and then killed. Superoxide dismutases were detected by specific RIAs: catalase by polarography, and lipid peroxide by fluorimetry. Hypothyroid rats failed to grow, while hyperthyroid rats had hypertrophied hearts but no growth failure. An increase in lipid peroxide was observed in the soleus and heart muscles of hyperthyroid rats. This was accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and oxidative markers. No such change was observed in either fast glycolytic muscle or liver. Glutathione peroxidase decreased in all tissues of hyperthyroid rats, and there was a parallel decrease in catalase in most tissues. On the other hand, hypothyroidism induced a reduction in oxidative markers and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase in heart and skeletal muscles, but only a marginal change in lipid peroxidation. The cytosolic superoxide dismutase did not change in relation to either oxidative metabolism or lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that the enhanced oxidative metabolism and decreased glutathione peroxidase in hyperthyroidism result in an increase in lipid peroxidation and, in slow oxidative and heart muscle, possible organ damage. No adverse reaction mediated by active oxygen species was found in hypothyroid rat tissues.\r"

While in most lactotrophs TRH raises [Ca2+]i, the kinetics of this rise and the magnitude of its first and second phases vary considerably. For dopamine two clearly divergent response types can be observed. In part of the lactotrophs dopamine causes a lowering of [Ca2+]i from elevated levels, whereas in about 40% of the lactotrophs dopamine leads to a transient rise of [Ca2+]i. The present study reveals subclasses of lactotrophs with distinct [Ca2+]i response characteristics. It is suggested that such response type heterogeneity is a means of optimizing the secretory response to the complex regulatory influences on the pituitary.\r"

  ".W": "In the male rhesus monkey, the negative feedback regulation of gonadotropin secretion by the gonad appears to involve a specific inhibitory action of testicular hormone on FSH release at the level of the anterior pituitary gland. The purpose of the present study, which used the hypophysiotropic clamp preparation, was to determine whether circulating testosterone (T) or estradiol (E) comprises a major component of the testicular FSH-inhibiting factor in this species. Endogenous hypothalamic GnRH secretion was abolished or severely compromised in five adult male rhesus monkeys by placement of radiofrequency lesions in the region of the arcuate nucleus. Subsequently, an episodic pattern of activity in the pituitary-Leydig cell axis of these animals was restored by a chronic and unchanging intermittent iv infusion of GnRH (0.1 microgram/min for 3 min ever 3 h), which appears to provide the gonadotropes of lesioned animals with a hypophysiotropic drive comparable to that produced by the hypothalamus of animals with an intact central nervous system. Treatment of three animals with a specific anti-E-gamma-globulin fraction resulted in a marked and sustained rise in E-binding activity in serum, but this neutralization of circulating E did not elicit hypersecretion of FSH. In all five animals, initiation of T replacement on the day of orchidectomy, which maintained circulating T concentrations in the high testis-intact control range, failed to prevent the postcastration hypersecretion of FSH that is evoked after removal of testis in the hypophysiotropic clamp preparation. As expected, the changes in circulating LH levels during immunoneutralization and after orchidectomy and T replacement were unremarkable. These findings indicate that neither circulating T nor E can account for the testicular inhibition of FSH secretion in the rhesus monkey and thus lead, by a process of exclusion, to the view that in this species the negative feedback regulation of FSH release by the testis is mediated directly at the level of the gonadotrope by an inhibitory action of a nonsteroidal hormone, most probably the recently identified gonadal peptide inhibin.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports the synthesis and biological activities of 1-desamino, 7-lysine-(4-azidobenzoyl), 8-arginine vasotocin (d7-N3-AVT). This compound was found to be biologically active in the rat antidiuretic assay (20 U/mg), to behave as an antagonist of vasopressin in the rat pressor assay (pA2 = 6.6), and to yield a half-maximal hydroosmotic response in the isolated toad urinary bladder at a bath concentration of 2.4 X 10(-8) M. When toad bladders were exposed to d7-N3-AVT in the presence of long wavelength UV light, the hydroosmotic response persisted in spite of prolonged and repeated periods of washout. By contrast, the hydroosmotic response in control bladders after stimulation with d7-N3-AVT in the absence of UV irradiation was fully reversed within 15 min of washout. A membrane preparation derived from bladders that had been photolabeled with d7-N3-AVT and washed for 1 h specifically bound 325 fmol [3H]vasopressin/mg protein. Matched bladders exposed to the analog in the absence of UV irradiation and washed for 1 h specifically bound 591 fmol [3H]vasopressin per mg of protein. These studies indicate that d7-N3-AVT binds covalently to hydroosmotic receptors of toad urinary bladder and forms a complex that is functional in triggering an increase in the permeability to water of the epithelium. This analog may prove useful in the isolation and purification of vasotocin receptors in lower vertebrates.\r"

In 16 nonpregnant subjects, inhibin rose during the luteal phase to reach a peak (2.5 U/ml) 6 days after oocyte retrieval; it then fell to undetectable levels by day 14 (less than 0.37 U/ml). Serum inhibin was significantly correlated (P less than 0.001) with both serum progesterone and estradiol concentrations and inversely correlated with serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (P less than 0.001). In the pregnant group (n = 3), inhibin levels reached an initial peak (3.7 U/ml) on day 6, then declined to a nadir (1.5 U/ml) on day 8 after oocyte retrieval and subsequently rose to 3.4 U/ml on day 14. These data suggest (1) an inverse relationship between inhibin and FSH, which is in support of the inhibin hypothesis; (2) that the human corpus luteum secretes inhibin; and (3) a trophoblastic/placental origin of inhibin during gestation.\r"

There were no significant differences in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptors between the testes treated with ICI 118630 and testes obtained from untreated prostatic cancer patients. In the other three patients, testicular responsiveness evaluated using hCG stimulation was similar before and after 4 weeks of treatment. In vitro studies testes removed from untreated prostatic cancer patients were cultured in a medium with or without ICI 118630 for 5 days. There were no significant differences in FSH and hCG receptors and T production between the two groups. In conclusion, ICI 118630 had no direct inhibitory effect on human testes.\r"

The drug was administered by a pump at 120-minute intervals. Dosage was 1 ampule Metrodin (75 IU of FSH less than 0.11 IU of LH)/day. Eight cycles of treatment were effected. With the IIV regimen, ovulation rate was 75% (six cycles). Two multiple pregnancies and one abortion (mola vescicularis) were observed. Preovulatory E2 plasma levels and the number of follicles recruited per cycle varied from 530 to 3800 pg/ml and from 4 to 15, respectively. Maximal follicular diameter was between 16 and 28 mm. LH levels significantly decreased, while FSH levels were unchanged, resulting in a decrease of LH/FSH ratio. It is concluded that the IIV FSH regimen offers an additional modality for the induction of ovulation in PCOD patients. Further clinical trials with alternative regimens are needed, however, to identify the optimal dosage and frequency of administration of the drug.\r"

All patients were initially treated during spontaneous ovulatory cycles with IUI performed after the detection of an endogenous lutenizing hormone (LH) surge (phase 1). For phase 2, those patients who had not conceived were offered treatment with fertility medication and IUIs were scheduled accordingly. Four of 76 (5.3%) patients conceived during 180 treatment cycles in phase 1; 9 of 44 (20.5%) patients conceived during 105 treatment cycles in phase 2. The average MPO was 0.022 in phase 1, and 0.085 in phase 2: the difference is significant (P less than 0.02). The authors conclude that fertility medication improves MPO in ovulatory women who undergo IUI for certain infertility situations.\r"

  ".W": "Because pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) can initiate normal follicular maturation and corpus luteum function in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, the authors attempted to treat five women with inadequate and one with short luteal phase with GnRH therapy. Pulsatile administration of GnRH (5 micrograms intravenously every 90 minutes) was begun on days 1 to 4 and continued throughout the cycle. Blood levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen, and progesterone were monitored daily throughout the control and treatment cycles. There were 12 GnRH treatment cycles, all of them ovulatory. The length of the induced luteal phases varied from 11 to 17 days in all patients. Mean progesterone levels during GnRH treatment were significantly increased over those of the matched control cycles (control cycle 3.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml; treatment cycle 8.2 +/- 1.45 ng/ml [mean +/- standard error]). Endometrial biopsies obtained during the luteal phase (days 25 to 27) in five women were in phase during the GnRH treatment cycle, in contrast to the control cycle in which they were two or more days out of phase. One patient achieved pregnancy during the treatment cycle, but aborted spontaneously at 8 1/2 weeks. The data demonstrate that pulsatile GnRH infusion, when initiated in the early follicular phase, can restore normal corpus luteum function in women with luteal phase defects.\r"

In subsequent GnRH-stimulated cycles, 1 ampule of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) was given intramuscularly for 3 consecutive days once the dominant follicle had attained a diameter of 7 to 8 mm. In all women, subsequent administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced presumptive evidence of ovulation. Five cycles were induced in three women using this regimen. A conception occurred in all three. One woman has conceived a second time. It was concluded that some women with HA respond to GnRH with an inappropriate LH and suppressed FSH response that may be overcome successfully using small doses of hMG.\r"

Treatment began on day 3 of the cycle and was discontinued when at least 2 follicles attained diameters greater than or equal to 1.5 cm. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was given either 24 or 48 hours after the last dose of hMG. Although serum estradiol levels were lower in group 1, the average number of oocytes retrieved (3.2 versus 2.9), fertilized (1.9 versus 2.0), and cleaved (1.7 versus 1.8) per completed cycle did not differ between groups 1 and 2. Likewise, the number of oocytes that fertilized abnormally was similar in both groups (0.5 versus 0.3/cycle). However, the number of atretic oocytes (0.03 versus 0.5/cycle) and the percent of oocytes recovered from the cul-de-sac (0 versus 7.2%) were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in group 1. In group 1, administration of hCG 48 hours after the last dose of hMG was associated with a higher number of cleaving embryos (2.1 versus 1.5/cycle) and a higher pregnancy rate (34.8 versus 14.7%; P less than 0.05) when compared with injection at 24 hours. In group 2, the interval between hMG and hCG did not influence these results. Together, the associations between fewer oocytes that were atretic or recovered from the cul-de-sac, and a trend toward a higher pregnancy rate, suggest that follicular recruitment with 2 ampules of hMG is more appropriate than 3 ampules in an IVF program.\r"

  ".W": "This study compares the in vitro fertilization and cleavage rates of paired first- and last-recovered preovulatory human oocytes that were exposed to a 100% CO2 pneumoperitoneum and general anesthesia. In 305 consecutive cycles of laparoscopy, 1741 oocytes (5.7/cycle) were recovered. The exact time of aspiration (T) was recorded for each oocyte. The time interval (T1 to T2) between recovery of first and last oocytes ranged from 0 to 38 minutes and represented differences in the exposure time of first and last oocytes to the CO2 pneumoperitoneum and to general anesthesia. For all cycles (n = 305) without regard for T1 to T2, last-recovered oocytes fertilized less often than first-recovered eggs (P = 0.06; McNemar's test). When T1 to T2 was short (less than or equal to 5 minutes), first- and last-recovered oocytes fertilized at comparable rates (70.8% and 74.0%). When only cycles with T1 to T2 greater than 5 minutes were considered (n = 209), the difference in fertilization rates between first and last oocytes (68.5% versus 56.4%) was highly significant (P less than 0.01; McNemar's test). Pairing negated differences due to patient, cycle, or semen variables and first- and last-recovered oocytes had comparable maturity scores (4.0 +/- 0.5 versus 4.3 +/- 0.8). There were no significant differences in cleavage rates for first- and last-recovered oocytes that fertilized, regardless of the exposure interval (T1 to T2). We conclude that exposure to a 100% CO2 pneumoperitoneum and/or general anesthesia may adversely affect oocyte quality.\r"

Molar cholesterol-phospholipid ratios increased significantly at 2-7 days and then reverted to pretreatment levels. A significant positive correlation between insulin binding and cholesterol-phospholipid ratios was seen at all durations of treatment. Membrane microviscosity as measured by fluorescence polarization of the probe diphenylhexatriene was significantly decreased after 3 mo of therapy.

Two weeks of untreated diabetes did not change ouabain-inhibitable ATPase enzyme activity assayed in lens homogenates but did result in a decrease in the Na+-K+-ATPase transport activity as measured by 86Rb uptake in the intact lens. This was accompanied by a 100-fold increase in the levels of sorbitol and significant decreases in the levels of myo-inositol, ATP, and glutathione in the lens. Whereas all of these changes could be reversed by sorbinil treatment, the dose required for restoration of the depleted myo-inositol level (ED50 greater than 20 mg.kg-1.day-1) was much higher than the dose required to reverse the other changes (ED50 range 2-5 mg.kg-1.day-1). These results suggest that the restoration of lenticular Na+ -K+ -ATPase activity is not secondary to a normalization of myo-inositol levels and may provide evidence that the two parameters are not strictly associated in diabetic tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Vanadium compounds are known to affect multiple membrane and cytosolic phosphoenzymes from various tissues; the most characterized effect is the inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase. Since we previously reported that immunoreactive insulin (IRI) secretagogues tend to inhibit rat islet cation-dependent ATPases, we examined the effects of sodium vanadate on rat IRI secretion from incubated and perifused rat islets. In the presence of 2.4 mM Ca2+, vanadate (10(-3) M) induced biphasic IRI secretion with a background glucose of 100 mg/dl. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, IRI released from incubated islets by vanadate at 100 and 300 mg/dl glucose was doubled and tripled, respectively. Furthermore, this stimulatory effect was completely abolished by known inhibitors of IRI release such as somatostatin, epinephrine, and diphenylhydantoin. Although we found the expected dose-dependent inhibition by vanadate of islet membrane Na+-K+-ATPase activity, the mechanism of action of vanadate on IRI secretion remains unknown. Vanadate probably interacts in a complex fashion with different islet phosphoenzymes and may prove to be a useful probe to further unravel the mechanisms leading to insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Enhanced prostaglandin production is postulated to contribute to altered vascular reactivity and glomerular hyperfiltration in early insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus. Rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes (STZ-D) show glomerular hyperfiltration and develop renal disease. BB rats with genetic diabetes (BB-D) also hyperfilter but have only minor renal lesions. We therefore compared glomerular and mesangial prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production and glomerular contractility in response to pressors as a reflection of in vitro vascular reactivity in these models. Glomeruli isolated from rats with 3 wk of STZ-D produced significantly more PGE2 under basal and ionophore A23187-stimulated conditions than those from control rats. Glomeruli from BB-D rats under basal and stimulated conditions, however, generated amounts of PGE2 that were comparable to either those of nondiabetic littermates or of normal Wistar rats. Mesangial cells cultured from glomeruli of STZ-D, BB-D, and control rats all had identical prostaglandin profiles judged by conversion of [14 C]arachidonic acid. They also produced comparable amounts of PGE2 under basal conditions and after stimulation with angiotensin II or A23187, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Planar surface area of glomeruli isolated from control rats showed a dose-dependent decrease in response to angiotensin II (10(-11)-10(-9) M). This response to angiotensin II was at least as great in glomeruli from STZ-D rats. Contraction of glomeruli from control and STZ-D rats was also comparable after vasopressin or norepinephrine. Similarly, glomeruli from BB-D and BB control rats contracted in a comparable fashion to angiotensin II and norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum-deprived cells were preincubated in medium containing glyburide (10(-4) M) or diluent, then exposed to insulin (10(-6) to 10(-12) M) at the time of wounding, after which the centrosomal-orientation and migratory responses of the cells bordering the experimental wound were monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy and time-lapse cinemicrophotography, respectively. Insulin (10(-6) M) stimulated the centrosomal-orientation and locomotor responses, resulting in the narrowing of the linear wound. Glyburide enhanced the effect of insulin on both parameters of the locomotor response and also sensitized the cells to a previously ineffective concentration of insulin (10(-12) M). The action of glyburide depended on a preincubation period of greater than or equal to 60 min and was blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. The relevance of this novel action of glyburide to the impaired healing process observed in diabetic patients requires further study.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) on the structural development of rat jejunal absorptive epithelial cells was evaluated. Stereologic characteristics of jejunal histologic subcompartments, epithelial cell surfaces and volumes, and volumes of key subcellular organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes) in crypt and villus mid and tip cells were determined by morphometric analysis of light and electron micrographs in well-nourished rats and rats with PEM. In rats with PEM there were developmental alterations in cells migrating on villi that were not seen in crypt cells. The amplification of the apical microvillus surface between mid and tip levels in well-nourished rats (679-1085 micron2/cell) failed to occur in rats with PEM (807-729 micron2/cell). This resulted in an estimated 60% reduction of total jejunal absorptive surface, from 10,070 cm2 in well-nourished rats to 3975 cm2 in rats with PEM. In contrast, the development of the basolateral surface, which requires much less membrane accrual, was unaffected by PEM. Villus mid and tip cells of rats with PEM also had increased cell volume and mitochondrial volumes. Microvillus surface area per cell appears dependent on the number of microvilli per cell, which equals the cell flat surface times the microvillus numerical density (number of microvilli per square micrometer) in well-nourished rats. However, this relationship was not demonstrable in rats with PEM.\r"

A consecutive series of 96 patients with two or more duodenal ulcers at endoscopy, representing 9.6% of the total number of new patients with duodenal ulcer seen during the period 1980-1985, were compared with a random series of 200 patients with single duodenal ulcer seen in the middle years of this period. Multiple duodenal ulcer was associated with higher (p less than 0.02) male to female ratio, more (p less than 0.05) late onset patients (those with ulcer symptoms starting after age 30 years, more (p less than 0.05) chronic cigarette smokers, and more frequent (p less than 0.05) moderate to severe deformity of the duodenal bulb. More (p less than 0.05) patients with multiple duodenal ulcer had abnormally low D50 derived from pentagastrin dose response tests, indicating that they were more sensitive to gastrin stimulation. Furthermore, their mean fasting and meal stimulated serum gastrin concentrations were significantly higher than those of patients with single ulcer (p less than 0.005), or of controls (p less than 0.05). Compared with single duodenal ulcer, multiple ulcer had significantly lower placebo healing rate, and required a higher dose of misoprostol (1200 v 800 micrograms/day) to achieve a similar healing efficacy at four weeks. We conclude that multiple duodenal ulcer is associated with different clinical features, pathophysiology, and possibly therapeutic response from single duodenal ulcer, and appears to represent the more aggressive side of the ulcer spectrum.\r"

Based on initial ad libitum intake of hospital diet, patients were grouped as six patients with adequate caloric intake who underwent a repeated 3-day balance study to assess the effect of hospitalization (Group I) and eight anorectic patients who underwent a repeat balance study during constant nasoduodenal infusion of the liquid formula Isocal-HCN in an amount sufficient to provide 35 kcal per kg ideal body weight (Group II). During the initial phase of hospital tray diet, the mean digestibilities of energy, fat, protein and carbohydrate, and the mean nitrogen balance were similar in each group. The digestibilities of each diet constituent and nitrogen balance were similar in both phases of hospital tray diet in patients in Group I. On the other hand, the infusion of Isocal-HCN to patients in Group II resulted in significant increases over their baseline values in intakes of energy and protein and in digestibilities of energy, fat and protein, and in a 5-fold increase in nitrogen balance.

Therefore, we investigated the liver biopsies of patients with hepatitis B (28 patients) and non-A, non-B (21 patients) by immunoelectron microscopy with monoclonal antibodies directed at lymphocyte subtypes (pan-B, pan-T, T8, T4 and NKH1) and at activation epitopes (IL-2 receptor, TA1 and T11/3) as well, in order to determine the phenotype in association with the activation status of the lymphocytes that are in close contact with hepatocytes; thus, establishing an effector-target cell relationship on the ultrastructural level. We were able to confirm the central role of T8 lymphocytes being the predominant type of lymphocytes in close contact with liver cells in the space of Disse. A certain percentage of these cells expressed \"activation\" markers as IL-2 receptor, TA1 and T11/3. In acute hepatitis, the NK lymphocytes made up a fifth of all lymphocytes, whereas their number dropped below 10% in the chronic stage. There was a vague correlation between the inflammatory activity of the disease and the expression of HLA antigens (both classes I and II) on inflammatory cells and also on hepatocytes.

It appears that two basic types of transport defects, increased cell membrane permeability to sodium and decreased active pumping of sodium at a given internal sodium concentration, can exist in vascular smooth muscle in experimental hypertension, and that sometimes the two defects coexist, further increasing internal sodium concentration. It is possible that eventually we may find similar transport defects in vascular smooth muscle in humans with arterial hypertension. Decreased active pumping at a given internal sodium concentration appears to result from a humoral sodium pump inhibitor. Future directions for research in the area are also considered. First priority should be given efforts to determine the chemical structure of the sodium pump inhibitor(s). High priority should also be given to attempts to measure passive and active sodium fluxes and intracellular sodium concentration in vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo, and to determine the role of atrial natriuretic factor in the genesis and maintenance of hypertension.\r"

Small amounts of beta-arachidoyllysophosphatidylcholine, gamma-docosapentaenoyllysophosphatidylcholine, gamma-eicosatrienoyllysophosphatidylcholine, and gamma-palmitoyllysophosphatidylcholine were also detected by both fast atom bombardment mass and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometric studies. Only gamma-acyllysophosphatidylcholines showed inhibitory activities on Na+,K+-ATPase and ouabain-binding activities. These lysophosphatidylcholines and unsaturated free fatty acids were effective at 100 microM levels in attaining 50% inhibition of the enzyme activity. The ouabain-displacing activity in plasma caused by these compounds increased with time during saline infusion. The maximal plasma levels of these components were approximately 10 times higher than that in the preinfusion plasma sample.\r"

We present here a new and simple sodium-loading method that allows a simultaneous kinetic study of the above abnormalities. The use of this kinetic assay may improve estimation of the frequencies, clinical features, and other properties of each subgroup of hypertensive patients in different populations.\r"

Four native forms were isolated and their amino acid sequences were determined. The presence of a high-molecular-weight prohormone was shown. Complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding for the precursor was cloned and used to deduce the amino acid sequence of the prohormone. Genomic DNA for ANF was cloned and two introns were found. Several ANF peptides were synthesized. Structure-function studies showed that the ring structure was essential for the activity. Antibodies produced against the synthetic 25-amino acid residue ANF were used to develop a radioimmunoassay. The presence of ANF in rat plasma demonstrated that ANF is a circulating hormone. ANF was also found in the hypothalamus of rats. The ANF in plasma was found to be a low-molecular form, whereas that in atria and hypothalamus consisted of both the high-molecular-weight precursor and low-molecular-weight active ANF. The presence of messenger RNA for ANF was determined using ANF cDNA as a probe and was considered as evidence for ANF synthesis in the brain, atrium, and ventricles. ANF was shown to be released from the brain. ANF administered intracerebroventricularly was shown to inhibit angiotensin II and thirst-induced dipsogenesis. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed ANF inhibits release of vasopressin from posterior pituitary and renin from the kidneys. The hypotensive effect of ANF was examined at various doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The sequence of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has been determined, as well as the complete structure of the rat and human complementary DNA and gene. ANF and ANF messenger RNA are present not only in atria but also in ventricles. The circulating form of ANF has been identified as the C-terminal of the molecule, ANF (Ser 99-Tyr 126). The isolated secretory granules of rat atrial cardiocytes contain only pro-ANF (Asn 1-Tyr 126). An enzyme (IRCM-SP1) has been isolated from heart atria and ventricles. This enzyme is highly specific in cleaving ANF (Asn 1-Tyr 126), to yield ANF (103-126), (102-126), and (99-126). In target cells, ANF produces a rise in cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) due to activation of particulate guanylate cyclase, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase leading in some cases to a decrease in cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). ANF produces relaxation of rabbit and rat aortic strips, inhibits steroidogenesis in both zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata cells, and inhibits the release of arginine vasopressin from the isolated rat hypothalamohypophysial preparation in vitro but decreases AVP release in vivo only at pharmacological doses. In all forms of experimental hypertension, plasma levels of ANF are increased and, at some time periods, atrial levels are also decreased. The ventricular levels of immunoreactive ANF are also increased in renal hypertension. Infusion of ANF by minipumps decreases the blood pressure near control levels in several models of experimental hypertension. In cardiomyopathic hamsters with heart failure, the atrial levels of immunoreactive ANF are decreased while the plasma and ventricular levels are increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has pharmacological actions resulting in lower atrial and arterial pressures. Atrial distention stimulates ANF release, suggesting that ANF is an effector limb of a feedback loop for controlling cardiac filling pressure. To test this hypothesis it will be necessary to determine whether physiological atrial distention releases ANF in sufficient amounts to exert biological actions. Immunoblockade of endogenous ANF and attenuation of ANF release by atrial ablation inhibited volume-induced natriuresis in rats. Infusion of ANF in rats at doses mimicking those observed during experimental volume expansion produced a natriuresis sufficient to partly account for the volume-induced response. Infusion of ANF at doses expected to change plasma ANF levels minimally decreased arterial pressure in hypertensive rats over 7 days. In dogs, some studies suggest that increased plasma ANF levels following experimental changes in atrial pressure were not sufficient to exert acute cardiovascular or renal actions, whereas others support such a notion and indicate that ANF inhibited barostimulated renal renin release. This last action could alter arterial pressure in the long term by allowing sodium equilibrium at lower renal arterial pressure. Infusion of ANF in humans that produced plasma levels in the upper physiological range caused increased sodium excretion and decreased plasma renin activity. Although data are exiguous, justifying neither acceptance nor rejection of the hypothesis that ANF functions physiologically to regulate body fluid volume and arterial pressure, the current evidence slightly favors acceptance.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that vascular smooth muscle cells possess a prominent Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport system that can be markedly stimulated by elevations in levels of intracellular cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). Since others have shown that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) can bind to specific membrane receptors and can enhance cGMP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells, we asked whether ANF could also stimulate Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport in vascular smooth muscle cells. It was discovered that rat atriopeptin III stimulated Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport of vascular smooth muscle cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, rat atriopeptin III had no effect on two other sodium transport systems known to be present in vascular smooth muscle cells (i.e., Na+-H+ exchange and Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). These studies indicated that ANF selectively stimulates Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport of vascular smooth muscle cells. We then asked whether ANF-stimulated Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport was dependent upon the ability of ANF to enhance intracellular cGMP levels. When rat atriopeptin III-stimulated increases in cGMP were inhibited with the quinolinedione LY 83583, rat atriopeptin III could no longer stimulate Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport of vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus it appeared that the effects of ANF were dependent upon the ability of ANF to elevate intracellular cGMP levels. Finally, we asked whether ANF effects on Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport were related to the biological activity of ANF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using manipulations of ion gradients and recordings of ion currents, membrane potentials, and tension, I have found evidence for calcium regulation as the central pathophysiological mechanism in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Increased sodium pump activity, which may be a partial compensation for the increased sodium influx in hypertension, may thus be secondary to altered calcium channel regulation in hypertension. The calcium channel, and the membrane potentials governing it, seem to be the most immediately important membrane mechanisms for hypertension research.\r"

Intraerythrocytic sodium concentration and sodium-lithium countertransport showed no significant correlation in spouses and very significant correlations between siblings and between parents and offspring (r = 0.34-0.58, p less than 0.001), suggesting mostly genetic determination. Using maximum likelihood tests of different genetic models, both sodium-lithium countertransport and intraerythrocytic sodium showed predominantly polygenic determination (H2 = 70%) and some possible major gene determinants (H2 = 18-25%) for a total heritability of 89 to 95% for these characteristics. These data suggest both genes and shared family environment contribute to the familiality of cation tests. They also illustrate the need and utility of quantitative methods for objective analysis of pedigree data.\r"

Both transporters are family aggregated and determined mainly by genetic factors; they are present in kidney and vascular cells, where they are regulated by vasoactive substances. To assess the physiological function of these two transporters, we investigated their kinetic and equilibrium properties, and their modulation by vasoactive substances. Recent studies in red blood cells indicate that the Li+-Na+ exchanger may be a mode of operation of the Na+-H+ exchanger, which plays an important role in the regulation of cell pH, cell volume, and transtubular sodium transport. In vascular cells, Na+-H+ exchanger is modulated by vasoconstrictors such as growth factors and angiotensin, while Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport is modulated by vasodilators such as atrial natriuretic factor and bradykinin. Kinetic studies in red blood cells of hypertensive patients and their offspring indicate the presence of subsets with elevated Vmax of Li+-Na+ exchange or high Km for cell sodium for outward Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport. The latter alteration is found most frequently in young blacks born of hypertensive parents, and it appears to be dependent on their level of sodium intake. The relationship between the alterations of the red blood cell sodium exchanger and Na+-K+-Cl- cotransport and risk factors for hypertension indicates that they can provide a tool to examine the interaction of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors in human hypertension.\r"

A total of 508 individuals, 255 with high blood pressure, were studied. Both sexes, blacks and whites, and several age groups were represented. The intervention studies included short-term dietary sodium restriction in normotensive adolescents, and a 4-year multifactorial trial on weight, sodium, and alcohol in hypertensive adults. The findings from these surveys and intervention studies are summarized in this report. Sodium-stimulated lithium countertransport was significantly related to diastolic blood pressure in white adults (r = 0.28, p less than 0.001), and to systolic blood pressure in black children (r = 0.50, p less than 0.005) and white adolescents (r = 0.31, p less than 0.05). Lithium countertransport was related to sex and race, but not age. Body mass index had an independent relationship with lithium countertransport in some age groups. Lithium countertransport was lower in normotensive adults than in both younger and older hypertensive adults. Lithium countertransport did not differ significantly between subjects with hypertension treated with antihypertensive medications and those with untreated hypertension. Short-term dietary sodium restriction did not influence lithium countertransport in normotensive adolescents. Long-term dietary intervention was associated with low lithium countertransport in hypertensive adults able to maintain blood pressure control without medication. These findings indicate that lithium countertransport is related to blood pressure and hypertension among free-living individuals.\r"

The plasma concentration of the cytochemically detectable Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitor is substantially raised in the plasma of patients with essential hypertension, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and of Milan hypertensive rats. The concentration of activity in the hypothalamus of SHR is also considerably raised.

Inhibition of the sodium pump in vascular smooth muscle caused by such a circulating factor could increase vascular tone and sensitivity to vasoactive agents, and thereby result in arterial hypertension. Numerous efforts in the past failed to isolate the putative factor from urine and plasma. Recent studies have suggested that the hypothalamus is an important source of an endogenous Na+, K+-ATPase inhibitor, but its isolation from the tissue extracts has been rendered difficult by the presence of other cellular constituents that cause artifactual interference with the assays and purification procedures. Using an alternative approach of isolating the inhibitor from culture medium, we found that dispersed fetal rat hypothalamic neurons in a capillary culture system release a heat-stable, peptidic, low-molecular-weight, active sodium transport inhibitor that causes a reversible increase in vascular tone, sensitizes vascular smooth muscle to the vasoactive effect of norepinephrine, and possesses several characteristics of the putative endogenous digitalislike factor. This inhibitor may be a chemical mediator linking kidney, brain, and cardiovascular system in the genesis of experimental volume-expanded and salt-loaded hypertension and human essential hypertension.\r"

Hypothalamic factor inhibits Na+, K+-ATPase only from the extracellular surface. It prevents the phosphorylation from magnesium and inorganic phosphate of the active site aspartate residue of Na+, K+-ATPase and stabilizes the enzyme in an E2 conformation, preventing a sodium-induced shift from E2 to E1. Binding and dissociation reactions of hypothalamic factor in cultured renal tubular epithelial cells show a time frame different from that in isolated membranes and consistent with physiological relevance. A possible mechanism for the physiological regulation of Na+, K+-ATPase, including a cycle of binding and rapid dissociation in intact renal tubular cells, is discussed.\r"

In this report, we describe the purification of inhibitors of Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) from the plasma of volume-expanded individuals. Of the two amphipathic materials obtained, only one of the factors when present in high concentrations showed the slow time-dependent component of inactivation similar to that of the cardiac glycosides. Inhibition was reduced in the presence of plasma proteins and was freely reversible. Both factors inhibited potassium-dependent p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity and specific [3H]ouabain binding in a manner similar to the cardiac glycosides. In contrast to ouabain and vanadate, however, high concentrations of potassium or norepinephrine, respectively, did not affect the magnitude or kinetic characteristics of inhibition. Structural analysis by mass spectroscopy showed a mass of 444 for factor 1, whereas factor 2 was conclusively identified as lysophosphatidylcholine-gamma-palmitoyl. These factors probably inhibit Na+, K+-ATPase by a nonspecific mechanism involving reversible perturbation of lipid-enzyme interactions required for normal catalytic activity. The significance of these factors as modulators of sodium transport may be limited to pathological states associated with abnormalities in plasma protein binding or lipid metabolism. They do not appear to be directly related to the humorally mediated disturbance of cellular sodium transport in hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "This review summarizes our bioassay methods for determining the level of humoral sodium pump inhibiting factor after acute volume expansion in experimental animals and humans, and in low renin experimental and human essential hypertension. In brief, ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake and membrane potential in blood vessels from normal animals are measured after incubation in plasma supernate from experimental subjects and animals and their respective controls. The data show that humoral sodium pump inhibitor is elevated after acute volume expansion in normal animals (dogs and rats) and in normal humans. The level of inhibitor is also elevated in patients with low renin essential hypertension and in experimental animals with low renin, volume-dependent types of hypertension, namely, one-kidney, one wrapped hypertension in dogs, and one-kidney, one clip and reduced renal mass-saline hypertension in rats. Humoral sodium pump inhibiting factor inhibits the Na+-K+ pump in the cardiovascular system. Such inhibition by other means (hypokalemia, cardiac glycosides) activates the system. Therefore, we also discuss the possible role of humoral sodium pump inhibitor in low renin volume-dependent hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that endogenous inhibitors of the sodium pump exist and bind to the cardiac glycoside binding site on Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) has been a source of much controversy. Although numerous hormones and inorganic ions that modulate Na+,K+-ATPase activity have been described, most of these affect the sodium pump indirectly by varying the intracellular sodium concentration or by increasing the number of enzyme units. None of these endogenous compounds has been shown conclusively to modulate sodium pump activity by binding to the cardiac glycoside binding site on Na+,K+-ATPase. However, the near-universal presence of three high-affinity binding sites on the alpha-subunit of the enzyme has engendered much speculation that endogenous ligands for these receptors must exist. In addition, none of the hormones known to indirectly affect sodium pump activity in vivo has been shown to modulate Na+,K+-ATPase activity in response to extracellular volume expansion or to play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension or chronic renal failure, conditions in which a circulating inhibitor of Na+,K+-ATPase has been implicated. This report presents a condensed history of the search for endogenous inhibitors of Na+,K+-ATPase and describes recent advances in the field. Despite progress in identifying and characterizing compounds that could affect Na+,K+-ATPase activity in vivo, definitive proof for the existence of endogenous ligands for the cardiac glycoside binding site remains elusive.\r"

Thus, we measured vascular responses in vasodilated (nitroprusside or adenosine), vascularly isolated, innervated hindlimb vascular beds of chloralose-anesthetized 1K1C rats perfused with their own blood at 1 ml/min. Complete norepinephrine dose-response curves in 8 rats with chronic and 28 with early 1K1C hypertension, compared with appropriate normotensive control rats, showed unchanged thresholds and ED50 values. Magnitude of ouabain-induced leftward shifts of the norepinephrine dose-response curve in 18 rats with chronic and 21 with early 1K1C hypertension, compared with appropriate normotensive control rats, was unchanged. Blockade of neural uptake of norepinephrine by desimipramine (10(-7) M) in 8 1K1C rats did not alter these results. These findings provide no evidence in this form and these stages of hypertension that humoral ouabainlike inhibitors of the Na+-K+ pump evoke physiologically significant inotropic effects in arterioles in vivo. It is possible, however, that induction of vascular Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase by circulating inhibitors modified the vascular responses to norepinephrine and ouabain in these rats.\r"

After the 13-week treatment period, follow-up examination was performed, followed by 3 additional examinations at 4-week intervals. Of those men receiving hCG-hMG, 2 induced pregnancies in their wives, while no pregnancies were reported in the placebo group.

It was not possible to predict the outcome of treatment based on results of GnRH and hCG tests performed before the treatment phase.\r"

Plasma ANP levels rose from 10.9 +/- 1.6 (+/- SEM) to 33.3 +/- 2.4 pmol/L after 60 min of constant infusion with the men in the supine position. On standing, plasma ANP increased further to 40.6 +/- 3.4 pmol/L, then fell to 32.2 +/- 2.7 pmol/L with resumption of supine posture. The calculated MCR of ANP fell from a mean of 7.7 to 5.7 L/min on standing, but rose again to 7.6 L/min upon lying down. We conclude that body posture has a significant effect on the rate of clearance of ANP from plasma.\r"

Among preterm newborn infants (26-32 weeks gestation), the total, HDL, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in umbilical cord serum of 11 newborns exposed to 4 doses of dexamethasone (5 mg each) within 1 week of delivery [mean, 3.05 +/- 1.01 (+/- SD), 0.83 +/- 0.18, and 1.84 +/- 0.69 mmol/L, respectively] and of 3 anencephalic newborns (2.84 +/- 0.57, 0.83 +/- 0.36, and 1.89 +/- 0.54 mmol/L) were increased to a similar extent over those in 17 normal newborns (1.76 +/- 0.16, 0.62 +/- 0.16, and 1.14 +/- 0.13 mmol/L). On the other hand, umbilical cord serum Apo A-1 levels were markedly increased only in the dexamethasone-treated preterm newborns (1.35 +/- 0.55 g/L; anencephalic, 0.78 +/- 0.15 g/L; normal, 0.68 +/- 0.06 g/L). Also, whereas serum total, HDL, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in 5 term anencephalic newborns (3.85 +/- 1.37, 1.06 +/- 0.08, and 2.64 +/- 0.91 mmol/L) were substantially higher than those in 41 normal term newborns (1.42 +/- 0.28, 0.57 +/- 0.12, and 0.74 +/- 0.05 mmol/L), serum Apo A-1 levels were similar at term in anencephalic (1.01 +/- 0.30 g/L) and normal newborns (0.99 +/- 0.08 g/L). Normal Apo A-1 and lipoprotein cholesterol levels were found in an additional newborn who was delivered 30 days after exposure to dexamethasone. We conclude that intrauterine glucocorticosteroid treatment leads to transiently increased serum Apo A-1 levels in the newborn. This increase, however, is not likely to be secondary consequence of the hypercholesterolemia that also occurs in such newborns, since hypercholesterolemia of a similar extent in anencephalic newborns, who have atrophic adrenals, was not associated with marked changes in serum Apo A-1 levels.\r"

To assess if the decline in serum T levels in healthy aging men is paralleled by an age-related decline in the bioavailable non-sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-bound fraction of T and to determine whether there are age-related changes in LH secretion or LH control of T production, we studied 29 young (aged 22-35 yr) and 26 elderly (aged 65-84 yr) healthy men. All men had single random blood samples drawn, and 14 men in each age group underwent frequent blood sampling for 24 h, both before and after 7 days of clomiphene citrate (CC) administration. Both mean 24-h serum total T levels and non-SHBG-bound T were reduced in elderly men compared to those in young men (P less than 0.05), while estradiol and SHBG levels were similar in the 2 age groups. Serum FSH determined by RIA and LH by RIA and bioassay were higher in the elderly men compared to those in young men (P less than 0.05), but the ratios of LH bioactivity to immunoreactivity and the LH pulse frequency and amplitude were similar. After CC administration, mean serum total T and non-SHBG-bound levels in young men increased by 100% and 304%, respectively, while in older men these values increased by only 32% and 8%, respectively. However, CC-stimulated LH pulse characteristics and serum levels of estradiol, SHBG, FSH, and bioactive and immunoreactive LH were similar in the 2 groups. Thus, both at baseline and after CC stimulation, elderly men had significantly lower serum total T and non-SHBG-bound (bioavailable) T levels than did young men, despite similar or increased levels of bioactive LH and similar bioactive to immunoreactive LH ratios and LH pulse characteristics. These results suggest that major age-related changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis occur at the level of the testes and are manifested by decreased responsiveness to bioactive LH. Administration of CC to young and elderly men resulted in similar changes in LH pulse characteristics and LH bioactivity and immunoreactivity, suggesting preserved hypothalamic-pituitary responsiveness in the elderly.\r"

RU486 (3 mg/kg, orally) was administered for 3 consecutive days after ultrasound documentation of a dominant follicle. In six of the eight women, RU486 was given after emergence of the dominant follicle, while in two women, RU486 was initiated during the preovulatory period when estradiol levels had exceeded 917 pmol/L. In the six women given RU486 after emergence of the dominant follicle, RU486 significantly prolonged the follicular phase duration from 15.6 +/- 1.9 (+/- SD) to 28.6 +/- 9.3 days (P less than 0.01) and extended the treatment cycle length to 42.3 +/- 9.1 (+/- SD) days (P less than 0.01). During RU486 treatment, mean serum estradiol levels decreased from 385 +/- 43 to 228 +/- 28 pmol/L (P less than 0.01), while LH, FSH, ACTH, cortisol, and progesterone levels changed little. LH pulse frequency and amplitude on the last day of RU486 administration did not differ from control values. Collapse of the dominant follicle was evident on ultrasound after RU486 administration and was not accompanied by uterine bleeding. In the two women treated during the preovulatory period, the follicular phase was not prolonged, and RU486 failed to delay the onset of the LH surge. Our findings indicate that RU486 treatment during the follicular phase interrupts normal follicular development, resulting in a delay of ovulation and a reinitiation of follicular recruitment.\r"

TRH stimulated TSH release in a dose-dependent manner. The ED50 was 2.9 +/- 0.6 (+/- SEM) nmol/L, similar to that reported for rat pituitary cell cultures. The release of TSH was calcium dependent, since the calcium channel antagonist verapamil inhibited TRH-stimulated TSH release, and the calcium ionophore A23187 stimulated TSH release. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate stimulated TSH secretion, while dibuytryl cAMP had no effect. Epinephrine and serotonin stimulated TSH release, and dopamine and somatostatin inhibited TRH-stimulated TSH release. These findings have directly demonstrated that the regulation of TSH secretion by hypothalamic neuropeptides and biogenic amines in the human pituitary is similar to that in the rat. The development of a tissue culture system to study thyrotrophs from postmortem human pituitaries provides the means for detailed studies of the regulation of TSH secretion in man.\r"

If the heightened pituitary reactivity characteristic of PCOD patients is secondary to chronic anovulation, ovulatory cycles should produce changes in the LH to FSH ratio and reduce the augmented response to GnRH. In a randomized cross-over study of 10 women with PCOD, GnRH (100 micrograms) was injected iv on the fifth day of 2 consecutive cycles, 1 of them following anovulation and progesterone withdrawal bleeding and the other following an induced ovulatory cycle. Mean basal plasma 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, and FSH levels were similar after ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. However, mean basal serum testosterone (P less than 0.05) and LH (P less than 0.01) levels were significantly lower, as were LH levels 30, 60, and 90 min (P less than 0.01) and FSH levels 60 and 90 min (P less than 0.05) after GnRH injection, after an ovulatory cycle than after an anovulatory cycle. The pituitary response to GnRH in those PCOD patients, therefore, was more normal after an ovulatory cycle than after an anovulatory cycle. We conclude that the heightened pituitary reactivity characteristic of PCOD patients is associated with chronic anovulation.\r"

Because thyroid dysfunction is known to be associated with alterations in both renal function and vasomotor control, we investigate the possible effects of varying thyroid function on AP in humans and rats. Plasma AP concentrations were determined in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid patients and normal subjects. Plasma AP was also measured in some patients after the iv infusion of 1 L 150 mmol/L NaCl and after treatment of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Plasma and atrial AP concentrations were measured in hyperthyroid, euthyroid, and hypothyroid rats. Plasma AP concentrations did not differ in the hyperthyroid (n = 22), euthyroid (n = 45), and hypothyroid (n = 16) subjects [47.1 +/- 18.2 (mean +/- SD), 45.1 +/- 28.9, and 42.4 +/- 20.0 pg/mL, respectively]. After NaCl infusion, mean plasma AP concentrations did not increase significantly in any of the three groups. Treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism did not result in a significant change in plasma AP levels. In contrast, plasma AP concentrations were significantly higher in T4-treated (hyperthyroid) rats than in either euthyroid or propylthiouracil-treated (hypothyroid) rats [621 +/- 17 vs. 266 +/- 41 (P less than 0.01) and 210 +/- 28 pg/mL (P less than 0.001), respectively], whereas atrial AP contents were similar in the three groups of rats. We conclude that hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in man are not associated with significantly altered plasma AP concentrations. The higher plasma AP levels in T4-treated rats may reflect the relatively shorter duration or greater severity of thyroid dysfunction or thyroid hormone-induced myocardial hypertrophy in the animals.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the efficacy of multiple doses of GHRH-44 to enhance GH secretion and to determine the number of GHRH-44 doses required to exclude hypothalamic dysfunction, 12 doses of GHRH-44 were administered iv every 2 h to 4 GH-deficient patients beginning in the morning (group A) and to 4 GH-deficient patients beginning in the evening (group B). Five additional GH-deficient patients (group C) were given 4-18 GHRH-44 doses. The first and last doses were 5 micrograms/kg; all others were 1 microgram/kg. Higher GH responses were attained by 9 of the 13 patients after multiple GHRH-44 doses than after the initial GHRH-44 dose. After the first GHRH-44 dose, the peak plasma GH concentrations were less than 7 micrograms/L in 9 patients; 4 of 9 achieved GH concentrations above 7 micrograms/L after 5-7 GHRH-44 doses; 2 had measurable levels below 7 micrograms/L. GH concentrations remained undetectable in 3 older patients in group C. In the patients who had detectable GH levels after GHRH-44 treatment, serum somatomedin-C concentrations increased from 0.67 +/- 0.14 (+/- SEM) to 0.79 +/- 0.14 U/mL after 6 GHRH-44 doses (P less than 0.01; n = 10) then to 1.00 +/- 0.14 (+/- SEM) U/mL after an additional 4-6 GHRH-44 doses (P less than 0.05; n = 9). After 6 GHRH-44 doses in groups A and B, the integrated GH concentrations between 2000 and 0800 h were greater than the integrated GH concentrations between 0800 and 2000 h (P less than 0.02). These findings indicate that a hypothalamic defect cannot be excluded on the basis of an impaired response to a single dose of GHRH-44, that the number of GHRH doses required to stimulate GH release in GH-deficient patients is variable, and that in addition to the possibility of genetically determined GHRH insensitivity some non-responding patients have developed severe acquired resistance to GHRH. Evidence for diurnal variation in the responsiveness of somatotropes to GHRH-44 in GH-deficient patients was also found.\r"

The steroidogenic function of each cell type was assessed by measuring the gonadal steroids released into the incubation medium. The large cell fraction was estimated to be 97% pure, with minimal contamination by small cells, whereas the small cell fraction was approximately 68% pure, being contaminated with 10% large cells and 22% nonsteroidogenic cells. In the unstimulated state, large cells were approximately 2-fold more potent in progesterone formation and aromatase activity, but only half as potent in androstenedione and testosterone formation as an equal number of small cells. When stimulated with hCG, the small cells responded with significant increases in progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone release, but the large cells did not. Both cell types secreted estrone and 17 beta-estradiol in the presence of androgen substrate, but the addition of FSH significantly stimulated aromatization only in large cells. Thus, small and large human luteal cells have steroidogenic properties similar to those exhibited by follicular thecal and granulosa cells, respectively.\r"

The sarcoid cells, all collected from patients with normal calcium metabolism, synthesized 1,25-(OH)2-[3H]D3 from the substrate 25-hydroxyvitamin [3H]D3 (25OH-[3H]D3), whereas in vitro incubation with recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was required for induction of synthesis of the hormone by normal PAM. Exogenous 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10-100 nmol/L) decreased endogenous hormone production by normal PAM by approximately 45%. The relative inhibitory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was less pronounced in sarcoid PAM, in which 10-100 nmol/L 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited 250HD3-1-hydroxylase by approximately 25%. An accompanying induction of the 250HD3-24-hydroxylase, which is typical for renal cells, was found at low levels in only 3 of 10 experiments; in this regard, no differences between sarcoid and normal PAM were apparent. PTH or forskolin did not influence 250HD3 metabolism by PAM. 1,25-(OH)2D3 production by sarcoid PAM was enhanced by lipopolysaccharide and IFN gamma. Likewise, recombinant human interleukin-2 stimulated 1,25-(OH)2D3 production by sarcoid PAM, suggesting a possible role for both IFN gamma and interleukin-2 in the induction of 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis by sarcoid PAM in vivo. Recombinant human IFN alpha, IFN beta, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor had little effect. Dexamethasone and chloroquine, which have in vivo antihypercalcemic activity in sarcoidosis, both inhibited 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis by sarcoid PAM; chloroquine simultaneously stimulated the 24-hydroxylase. Our studies suggest that the 250HD3-metabolizing system in PAM is in some respects different from renal metabolism of 250HD3.\r"

A single population of high affinity receptors (Ka, 1.5-4 X 10(9) M-1) for human FSH was detected in testicular tissue of both species. Specific FSH binding was absent in the human ovaries but present in the two monkey fetal ovaries studied. FSH (1 microgram/mL) did not stimulate cAMP production in slices of any of the gonads studied (human fetal testes and monkey fetal testes and ovaries) or in cultured human granulosaluteal cells used in a control experiment, but FSH increased cAMP 10-fold in immature (10-day-old) rat testes. We conclude that the primate fetal testis, both during the first half and at the end of gestation, may be responsive to FSH stimulation, although this response does not involve the acute elevation of cAMP. In contrast, the absence of FSH receptors in early and midterm human fetal ovaries and the presence of such binding in this tissue in the late gestation monkey indicate that the ovary becomes responsive to FSH stimulation during later stages of fetal development.\r"

  ".U": "88059514\r", 
  ".W": "Although the menopause is generally considered to be the consequence of follicular exhaustion, the relationship between follicle number and the menopausal transition has not been explicity studied. We addressed this question in 17 women, aged 45-55 yr, who were undergoing elective total abdominal hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy. The women were divided into 3 groups according to their menstrual history: 1) menstruating regularly (n = 6), 2) perimenopausal (irregular menses; n = 7), and 3) postmenopausal (greater than 1 yr since last menses; n = 4). The mean ages of the 3 groups were similar. Menstrual histories were confirmed by plasma hormone levels and endometrial histology. One ovary from each woman was serially sectioned for determination of follicle numbers. The mean number of primordial follicles in the ovaries of women who were still menstruating regularly was 10-fold higher than that in perimenopausal women [1392 +/- 355 (+/- SEM) vs. 142 +/- 72]. Follicles were virtually absent in the postmenopausal ovaries. Comparison of these data with those obtained by others in younger women suggests that follicular depletion accelerates dramatically in the last decade of menstrual life. These results support the view that declining follicular reserve is the immediate cause of both the perimenopausal and menopausal transitions, and indicate that the rate and, therefore, the regulation of follicular depletion change during the final phase of reproductive life.\r"

In this study we measured the urinary excretion of the metabolites of prostacyclin [6-keto-prostaglandin F 1 alpha(6-keto) and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (dinor)] and of thromboxane A2 [thromboxane B2 (TxB2)] as well as serum HDL- and HDL2 cholesterol concentrations before and during DG and LN administration alone or in combination with ethinyl estradiol (EE) in 26 women. Before the trial, urinary dinor excretion correlated with serum total HDL cholesterol (r = 0.499; P less than 0.01) and HDL2 cholesterol levels (r = 0.668; P less than 0.001; n = 26). Administration of DG (150 micrograms/day; 14 women) or LN (150 micrograms/day; 12 women) for 2 weeks caused no changes in the excretion of these prostanoids, but LN administration decreased serum HDL cholesterol levels. After that, the women underwent a monophasic regimen of 150 micrograms DG or LN plus 30 micrograms EE for 3 months and thereafter polyphasic regimens of the same steroids for a further 3 months. The DG-containing pills increased urinary dinor excretion by 25-40%, but caused no changes in 6-keto and TxB2 excretion, as measured on days 19-21 of the cycles. LN-containing pills reduced urinary 6-keto excretion by 22% at the end of polyphasic treatment, but caused no changes in dinor and TxB2 output. DG plus EE, but not LN plus EE, increased serum total HDL and HDL2 cholesterol concentrations by a maximum of 25%. Thus, a DG plus EE combination may stimulate PGI2 synthesis by increasing the levels of HDL/HDL2. Theoretically, this stimulation protects against occlusive vascular disorders.\r"

The median peak serum GH level was 29 mU/L in response to GHRH, 28.9 mU/L in response to insulin hypoglycemia, 17.3 mU/L in response to galanin, and 115.0 mU/L in response to the combination of galanin and GHRH. GH release induced by galanin was completely inhibited by a concomitant somatostatin infusion (50 pmol/kg.min). Thus, galanin increased the peak GH response to GHRH, previously thought to be one of the most powerful stimulants to GH release, more than 3-fold. Since the dose of GHRH used was thought to be maximal and since galanin is reported not to have direct effects on the pituitary, one possible mode of action of galanin would be inhibition of tonic endogenous hypothalamic somatostatin release.\r"

  ".W": "Five women (group A) with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) and sterility for at least 3 yr were treated for 1 cycle for ovulation induction with a combined regimen of GnRH agonist (GnRH-A) plus highly purified FSH. The patients received GnRH-A (Buserelin; 200 micrograms, sc, twice a day) for 6 weeks and then GnRH-A combined with FSH highly purified (2 ampules a day; 75 IU FSH and less than 0.11 IU LH in each ampule). Ovarian response was evaluated by plasma estradiol (E2) assay and ultrasound examination, performed daily. Furthermore, plasma FSH and LH levels were assayed 3 times a week. Once a follicle was considered sufficiently developed, the combined regimen was withheld, and 24-48 h later hCG (5000 IU, im) was given. The results are compared with those of 31 ovulatory cycles induced by im FSH highly purified (group B) in PCOD patients with the same FSH administration, clinical, and monitoring protocols. Ovulation was achieved in all cycles treated by GnRH-A plus FSH. Two singleton and a twin pregnancy resulted. Multiple follicular development occurred in all cycles. Plasma E2 levels were generally in the normal range. Echographic and endocrine features in the 2 groups were as follows. 1) basal ovarian volume and ovarian enlargement were similar. 2) Group A had a greater number of follicles than did group B (P less than 0.01), while E2 to number of follicles and E2 to ovarian volume ratios were greater (P less than 0.01) in group B. 3) The linear correlations between plasma E2 levels and ovarian volume were markedly different in groups A and B (P less than 0.01). The regression line for group B had a steeper slope than that for group A. This finding indicates that at a fixed ovarian volume plasma E2 levels were significantly lower in group A than in group B. We conclude that the combined GnRH-A and FSH regimen may constitute an alternative and promising tool for the induction of ovulation in patients with PCOD.\r"

  ".W": "RU486, a 19-nor steroid, binds with high affinity to the receptors for progesterone and glucocorticoids, blocking the actions of these hormones on their target tissues. We conducted studies to determine whether RU486 administered at the end of the luteal phase would disturb the menstrual rhythm, ovulation, or hormonal parameters in the treatment and post-treatment cycles. The first study was done in six surgically sterilized women during two consecutive cycles. RU486 [17 beta-hydroxy-11 beta-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)17 alpha-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one; 100 mg/day] was given for 4 consecutive days, commencing on days 23-27 of the first cycle. Menstrual bleeding occurred by the second day of RU486 administration in all women and was indistinguishable from their usual bleeding pattern. The onset of this bleeding was advanced by RU486 administration, since it entailed shortening of the luteal phase with prolongation of the following follicular phase. Serum LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were normal in five of the six women in both the treatment and posttreatment cycles. The second study was conducted in 10 women who were not exposed to the risk of pregnancy. RU486 (100 mg/day) was given for 4 consecutive days, commencing 4 days before their expected menses for 3 successive cycles, preceded and followed by 2 placebo-treated cycles. Bleeding patterns were indistinguishable during the RU486 and placebo cycles. Late luteal phase administration of RU486 consistently produced menstrual bleeding within 1-3 days of drug administration. Daily early morning urinary LH excretion in 6 women and estrone glucuronide and pregnanediol glucuronide excretion in 5 women during both placebo and RU486 cycles were consistent with luteinization, suggesting ovulation and appropriate corpus luteum function. We conclude that RU486 has no major effect on menstrual cycle events if given at the time of the natural progesterone withdrawal that occurs before menses in nonpregnant women.\r"

Compared to the normal subjects, the depressed patients had reduced mean basal serum GH levels [2.2 +/- 0.5 (+/- SE) vs. 1.1 +/- 0.2 ng/mL (micrograms/L); P less than 0.05] and a significant attenuation of the net GH response to GHRH [1346 +/- 499 vs. 217 +/- 46 ng.min/mL (micrograms.min/L); P less than 0.01]. The blunted GH responses occurred in the face of significantly increased plasma somatomedin C (Sm-C) levels [1.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1 U/mL; P less than 0.05]. The magnitude of GH responses to GHRH did not differ between men and women and was not significantly correlated with age, body weight, baseline serum GH levels, or plasma Sm-C levels in either individual groups or both groups combined. The increased plasma Sm-C levels in the depressed patients could have resulted from diurnal hypersecretion of GH, and the diminished GH responses to GHRH may reflect normal Sm-C-mediated feedback at the level of the pituitary. The presumed GH hypersecretion may be due to decreased hypothalamic somatostatin release and/or hyperactivity of GHRH-containing neurons. Thus, the pathological process resulting in abnormal GH secretory patterns associated with depression may occur primarily at a suprapituitary site.\r"

After ischemia, a 4-h intrarenal infusion of alpha-hANP restored 14C-inulin clearances in bilaterally and unilaterally intact animals from 0.05 +/- 0.006 and 0.05 +/- 0.01 ml/min per 100 g to 0.314 +/- 0.04 and 0.25 +/- 0.01 ml/min per 100 g, respectively (P less than 0.001, n = 8), compared with normal values of 0.49 +/- 0.023 ml/min per 100 g. Histologically, there was a progressive decrease in medullary hyperemia and prevention of intratubular cell shedding and granulocyte margination as a result of the 4-h alpha-hANP infusion such that after 24 and 48 h the histological appearance of the tissue was essentially normal. The results show that a 4-h intrarenal infusion of alpha-hANP after renal ischemia can preserve glomerular filtration rate and reduce renal tissue damage.\r"

Effective retinoids induced a dose-dependent, specific increase in the production of TIMP of approximately two- to threefold by monolayer cultures of human fibroblasts derived from various tissues, while simultaneously causing a decrease in collagenase secretion of similar magnitude. These effects were apparent by 8-12 h in culture and disappeared within 24 h after the withdrawal of retinoid compounds. The retinoid effect on TIMP production was mediated via an increased biosynthesis of new inhibitor protein. Similarly, increased steady state levels of TIMP messenger RNA (mRNA) accompanied by decreased quantities of collagenase mRNA were demonstrated, suggesting transcriptional control of the retinoid action. The data suggest that retinoids co-regulate the expression of collagenase and TIMP, and do so in an inverse manner. Dexamethasone caused a dose-dependent, specific decrease in collagenase production without altering the biosynthesis of TIMP. These findings were paralleled by a marked reduction in collagenase mRNA, without any accompanying change in TIMP mRNA. Therefore, TIMP and collagenase expression appear to be independently modulated by glucocorticoids.\r"

Significantly greater amounts of saturated cholesteryl esters (CE) and triacylglycerols (TG) accumulate in HSV-1-infected human and bovine arterial SMC than uninfected cells. This CE accumulation results, in part, from decreased CE hydrolysis. Furthermore, arachidonate-stimulated, HSV-1-infected arterial SMC have a reduced capacity to produce prostacyclin (an agonist of intracellular CE hydrolytic activity) than uninfected, stimulated SMC. It appears that HSV-1 may induce lipid accumulation in arterial SMC similar, in part, to the lipid accumulation observed in vivo during human atherogenesis. Thus, herpesviruses may contribute to lipid accumulation, which is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Brief perfusion of heart with calcium-free medium renders myocardial cells calcium-sensitive so that readmission of calcium results in uncontrolled Ca2+ entry and acute massive cell injury (calcium paradox). We investigated the hypothesis that polyamines may be involved in the mediation of abnormal Ca2+ influx and cell damage in the calcium paradox. The isolated perfused rat heart was used for these studies. Calcium-free perfusion promptly (less than 5 min) decreased the levels of polyamines and the activity of their rate-regulating synthetic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), and calcium reperfusion abruptly (less than 15-180 s) increased these components. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a specific suicide inhibitor of ODC, suppressed the calcium reperfusion-induced increase in polyamines and the concomitant increase in myocardial cellular 45Ca influx, loss of contractility, release of cytosolic enzymes, myoglobin, and protein, and structural lesions. Putrescine, the product of ODC activity, nullified DFMO inhibition and restored the calcium reperfusion-induced increment in polyamines and the full expression of the calcium paradox. Putrescine itself enhanced the reperfusion-evoked release of myoglobin and protein in the absence of DFMO. Hypothermia blocked the changes in heart ODC and polyamines induced by calcium-free perfusion and calcium reperfusion and prevented the calcium paradox. These results indicate that rapid Ca2+-directed changes in ODC activity and polyamine levels are essential for triggering excessive transsarcolemmal transport of Ca2+ and explosive myocardial cell injury in the calcium paradox.\r"

Segments of femoral veins were grafted to the femoral artery of the dog. 6 wk after surgery the venous grafts were removed from the dog, cut into rings, and suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. In some rings the endothelial cells were removed. Acetylcholine and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists did not cause endothelium-dependent relaxations in venous grafts. The calcium ionophore (A23187) initiated such relaxations which were not mediated by prostanoids. Endothelium-dependent relaxations were also observed in venous grafts to ADP, thrombin, and arachidonic acid. In segments of graft where myo-intimal hyperplasia was prominent, relaxations to ADP, thrombin, and A23187 were blunted and in some segments contractions were observed. These results demonstrate the ability of the endothelium of venous grafts to initiate changes in tone of the smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "alpha 2-Antiplasmin (alpha 2-AP) is a major fibrinolysis inhibitor, whose complete, congenital absence has been found to be associated with a distinct hemorrhagic diathesis. We studied a 15-yr-old male with a hemorrhagic diathesis after trauma from early childhood on. This bleeding tendency was associated with a minimal alpha 2-AP level recorded functionally in the immediate plasmin inhibition test: less than or equal to 4% of normal. However, a normal plasma concentration of alpha 2-AP antigen (83%) was found. His sister (5 yr old) showed similar results (2 and 92%). In their family, eight heterozygotes could be identified by half-normal activity results and normal antigen concentrations. The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. On analysis, the alpha 2-AP of the propositus was homogeneous in all respects tested, suggesting a homozygous defect. We designated the abnormal alpha 2-AP as alpha 2-AP Enschede. alpha 2-AP Enschede showed the following characteristics: (a) complete immunological identity with normal alpha 2-AP; (b) normal molecular weight (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis); (c) normal alpha-electrophoretic mobility; (d) presence in plasma of both molecular forms excluding an excessive conversion to the less reactive non-plasminogen-binding form; (e) quantitatively normal binding to lys-plasminogen and to immobilized plasminogen kringle 1-3; and (f) normal Factor XIII-mediated binding to fibrin. Functional abnormalities were found in: (i) no inhibition of amidolytic activities of plasmin and trypsin, even on prolonged incubation; (ii) no formation of plasmin-antiplasmin complexes in plasma with plasmin added in excess; and (iii) no inhibition of fibrinolysis by fibrin-bound alpha 2-AP. In the heterozygotes, the presence of abnormal alpha 2-AP did not interfere with several functions of the residual normal alpha 2-AP. One-dimensional peptide mapping showed an abnormal pattern of papain digestion. We conclude that in this family, abnormal antiplasmin molecules, defective in plasmin inhibition but with normal plasminogen-binding properties, have been inherited. The residual plasminogen-binding properties do not protect against a hemorrhagic diathesis.\r"

  ".W": "Thromboxane synthase inhibition can lead to two opposing effects: accumulation of proaggregatory cyclic endoperoxides and increased formation of antiaggregatory PGI2 and PGD2. The elimination of the effects of the cyclic endoperoxides by an endoperoxide-thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist should enhance the inhibition of hemostasis by thromboxane synthase blockers. We have carried out a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies in healthy volunteers to check if this hypothesis may be operative in vivo in man. In a first study, in 10 healthy male volunteers, the combined administration of the thromboxane receptor antagonist BM 13.177 and the thromboxane synthase inhibitor dazoxiben gave stronger inhibition of platelet aggregation and prolonged the bleeding time more than either drug alone. In a second study, in 10 different healthy male volunteers, complete inhibition of cyclooxygenase with indomethacin reduced the prolongation of the bleeding time by the combination BM 13.177 plus dazoxiben. In a third study, in five volunteers, selective cumulative inhibition of platelet TXA2 synthesis by low-dose aspirin inhibited platelet aggregation and prolonged the bleeding time less than the combination BM 13.177 plus dazoxiben. In vitro, in human platelet-rich plasma stimulated with arachidonic acid, the combination of BM 13.177 and dazoxiben increased intraplatelet cAMP while the single drugs did not affect it. Our results indicate that prostaglandin endoperoxides can partly substitute for the activity of TXA2 in vivo in man and that an increased formation of endogenous antiaggregatory and vasodilatory prostaglandins, as obtained with selective thromboxane synthase inhibitors, may contribute to the impairment of hemostasis.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 25% of patients with pituitary adenomas have no clinical or biochemical evidence for excess hormone secretion and are classified as having null cell or nonfunctioning adenomas. To characterize the cell type of these tumors, we analyzed pituitary hormone gene expression in clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas using specific oligonucleotide probes for the messenger (m)RNAs encoding growth hormone, prolactin, ACTH, and the glycoprotein hormone subunits, alpha, luteinizing hormone (LH)beta, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)beta, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)beta. Expression of one or more of the anterior pituitary hormone genes was found in 12/14 (86%) of the patients with clinically classified nonfunctioning adenomas. Expression of one or more of the glycoprotein hormone genes (alpha, LH beta, FSH beta, TSH beta) was identified most commonly (79%) with expression of multiple beta-subunit genes in many cases. Expression of alpha-subunit mRNA was found in each of the adenomas from patients expressing one of the beta-subunit mRNAs and in three patients with no detectable beta-subunit mRNA. Although FSH beta and LH beta mRNAs were found with similar frequencies in nonfunctioning adenomas, expression of FSH beta mRNA was generally much more abundant. TSH beta mRNA was detected in only one adenoma. The levels of glycoprotein hormone subunit mRNAs were variable in different adenomas, but the lengths of the mRNAs and transcriptional start sites for the alpha- and beta-subunit genes were the same in the pituitary adenomas and in normal pituitary. Growth hormone and prolactin gene expression were not observed in the nonfunctioning adenomas, but ACTH mRNA was found in a single case. Immunohistochemistry of the adenomas confirmed production of one or more pituitary hormones in 13/14 (93%) nonfunctioning tumors, with a distribution of hormone production similar to that of the hormone mRNAs. These data indicate that pituitary adenomas originating from cells producing glycoprotein hormones are common, but are difficult to recognize clinically because of the absence of characteristic endocrine syndromes and defective hormone biosynthesis and secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Stretching of the atrial wall is a known stimulant for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion. Little is known about other factors that may influence ANP secretion. We examined the effects of the neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system on ANP secretion from isolated rat left atria. Superfusion with 10 muM norepinephrine produced a biphasic rise in ANP secretion with a peak response 2.5-fold above baseline secretion. To determine whether the response to norepinephrine primarily reflected alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, atria were superfused with 0.1 muM isoproterenol or 10 muM phenylephrine and 1 muM propranolol. ANP secretion in response to isoproterenol was biphasic, similar to the response to norepinephrine. Phenylephrine evoked a monophasic ANP secretory response, which was delayed in onset relative to that of isoproterenol or norepinephrine. Superfusion with 10 muM methacholine alone had no effect on ANP secretion, but rapidly attenuated norepinephrine-stimulated secretion by 67%. From these observations we conclude: (a) Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists directly and distinctively stimulate ANP secretion; (b) Norepinephrine stimulates ANP secretion by both alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, however the secretory response pattern of norepinephrine reflects a predominence of beta-adrenergic activity; (c) Under basal conditions, methacholine does not influence ANP secretion; and (d) Methacholine inhibits norepinephrine-stimulated ANP secretion. Thus, in vivo, activation of the sympathetic nervous system may enhance ANP secretion, whereas a rise in parasympathetic tone may lower ANP secretion.\r"

We previously demonstrated specific and functional binding of plasminogen to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In the present study we found that t-PA could bind to HUVEC. Binding of t-PA to HUVEC was specific, saturable, plasminogen-independent, and did not require lysine binding sites. The t-PA bound in a rapid and reversible manner, involving binding sites of both high (Kd, 28.7 +/- 10.8 pM; Bmax, 3,700 +/- 300) and low (Kd, 18.1 +/- 3.8 nM; Bmax 815,000 +/- 146,000) affinity. t-PA binding was 70% inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of u-PA. When t-PA was bound to HUVEC, its apparent catalytic efficiency increased by three- or fourfold as measured by plasminogen activation. HUVEC-bound t-PA was active site-protected from its rapidly acting inhibitor: plasminogen activator inhibitor. These results demonstrate that t-PA specifically binds to HUVEC and that such binding preserves catalytic efficiency with respect to plasminogen activation. Therefore, endothelial cells can modulate hemostatic and thrombotic events at the cell surface by providing specific binding sites for activation of plasminogen.\r"

In normal subjects, proapoA-I is secreted into plasma and converted to mature apoA-I by the cleavage of the amino-terminal six amino acids with the major isoprotein in plasma being mature apoA-I. In contrast, in Tangier disease there is a marked relative increase of proapoA-I as compared with mature apoA-I. ProapoA-I and mature apoA-I were isolated from normal and Tangier disease subjects, radio-labeled, and autologous apoA-I isoproteins injected into normal and Tangier subjects. The in vivo catabolism and conversion of proapoA-I and mature apoA-I in normal and Tangier disease subjects were quantitated. A comparison of the rate of catabolism of apoA-I isoproteins from plasma revealed a significantly faster rate of catabolism of both isoproteins of apoA-I in Tangier subjects when compared with normal subjects. The fractional conversion rate of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I was 3.9 d-1 in normal subjects and 3.6 d-1 in Tangier subjects. The results indicate that (a) apoA-I enters plasma as the pro isoprotein in both normal and Tangier subjects, (b) Tangier disease subjects have a normal fractional rate of conversion of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I, (c) proapoA-I is catabolized at the same rate as mature apoA-I in Tangier subjects, and (d) Tangier subjects catabolize both pro and mature apoA-I at a much greater rate than do normal subjects. Therefore, the relative increase in proapoA-I in Tangier disease is due to a marked decrease in mature apoA-I resulting from rapid catabolism of both pro- and mature apoA-I and not to defective conversion of proapoA-I to mature apoA-I.\r"

  ".U": "88059631\r", 
  ".W": "Angiotensin II (AII) in adrenal glomerulosa cells activates phospholipase C resulting in the formation of inositol phosphates and diacylglycerol rich in arachidonic acid (AA). Although glomerulosa cells can metabolize AA via cyclooxygenase (CO), this pathway plays little role in aldosterone synthesis. Recent evidence suggests that the lipoxygenase (LO) pathway may be important for hormonal secretion in endocrine tissues such as the islet of Langerhans. However, the capacity of the glomerulosa cell to synthesize LO products and their role in aldosterone secretion is not known. To study this, the effect of nonselective and selective LO inhibitors on AII, ACTH, and potassium-induced aldosterone secretion and LO product formation was evaluated in isolated rat glomerulosa cells. BW755c, a nonselective LO inhibitor dose dependently reduced the AII-stimulated level of aldosterone without altering AII binding (91 +/- 6 to 36 +/- 4 ng/10(6) cells/h 10(-4) M, P less than 0.001). The same effect was observed with another nonselective LO blocker, phenidone, and a more selective 12-LO inhibitor, Baicalein. In contrast U-60257, a selective 5-LO inhibitor did not change the AII-stimulated levels of aldosterone (208 +/- 11% control, AII 10(-9) M vs. 222 +/- 38%, AII + U-60257). The LO blockers action was specific for AII since neither BW755c nor phenidone altered ACTH or K+-induced aldosterone secretion. AII stimulated the formation of the 12-LO product 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) as measured by ultraviolet detection and HPLC in AA loaded cells and by a specific RIA in unlabeled cells (501 +/- 50 to 990 +/- 10 pg/10(5) cells, P less than 0.02). BW755c prevented the AII-mediated rise in 12-HETE formation. In contrast, neither ACTH nor K+ increased 12-HETE levels. The addition of 12-HETE or its unstable precursor 12-HPETE (10(-9) or 10(-8) M) completely restored AII action during LO blockade. AII also produced an increase in 15-HETE formation, but the 15-LO products had no effect on aldosterone secretion. These studies suggest that the 12-LO pathway plays a key role as a new specific mediator of AII-induced aldosterone secretion.\r"

To determine the value of early initiation of such therapy, two satellite community hospital emergency rooms were established for use of rt-PA and the experience was compared among 142 consecutive patients who were transferred to a regional center for acute cardiac catheterization after intravenous rt-PA therapy. In Group I (n = 19), patients received rt-PA after interhospital transport to the regional center, but before cardiac catheterization. In Group II (n = 70), rt-PA therapy was initiated by the helicopter physician and nurse team after their arrival at the local community hospital emergency room. Group III patients (n = 53) had rt-PA administered in the local community hospital by the emergency room physician. Group III patients had earlier initiation of therapy (2.1 +/- 0.8 hours in Group III versus 3.8 +/- 1.2 hours in combined Groups I and II, p less than 0.001) and an increased rate of infarct vessel recanalization on the 90 minute coronary angiogram (81 in Group III versus 67% in combined Groups I and II, p = 0.057). The patients in Group III had a higher acute left ventricular ejection fraction (54 +/- 8% versus 50 +/- 9.5% in combined Groups I and II, p less than 0.01) and a trend toward an increased 7 day ejection fraction (55.5 +/- 9% versus 51.7 +/- 9.5%, respectively, p = 0.08).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Angiovist-370 is a newer form of meglumine sodium diatrizoate that contains calcium EDTA as its additive and thus has a decreased calcium-binding effect. Eight hundred sixteen patients were prospectively randomized to receive either Renografin-76 or Angiovist-370. Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 10 of 410 patients receiving Renografin-76 and in 0 of 406 patients given Angiovist-370 (p less than 0.0005). Clinical data were analyzed without knowledge of other data in the 10 patients treated with Renografin-76 who had ventricular fibrillation (Group I), 103 randomly selected patients who also received Renografin-76 but had no ventricular fibrillation (Group II) and 108 randomly selected patients given Angiovist-370 (Group III). Of several variables examined, only the QT interval differentiated patients receiving Renografin-76 and Angiovist-370. The mean corrected QT interval (QTc interval) before coronary angiography was slightly but not significantly (p = 0.7) higher in Group I than in Groups II and III. Ten seconds after the first left coronary artery injection it was more prolonged in Groups I and II (0.552 and 0.561 second, respectively) than in Group III (0.448 second) (p less than 0.00005). Similarly, 10 seconds after the first right coronary artery injection it was significantly longer in Groups I and II (0.545 and 0.544 second) than in Group III (0.477 second) (p less than 0.00005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hemodynamics, blood volume and venous and arterial compliance were measured during each infusion. Nitroglycerin initially decreased mean arterial pressure from 81.5 +/- 2.0 to 57.6 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Central blood volume decreased from 21.1 +/- 1.4 to 15.9 +/- 1.1 ml/kg (p less than 0.01), while total blood volume and unstressed vascular volume did not change. In the acute study, nitroglycerin increased venous compliance 33% from 1.75 +/- 0.14 to 2.32 +/- 0.16 ml/mm Hg per kg (p less than 0.01) and arterial compliance 33% from 0.049 +/- 0.007 to 0.065 +/- 0.007 ml/mm Hg per kg (p less than 0.01). At the end of the 2 hour infusion, arterial pressure increased and was now unchanged from control. Central blood volume had returned to baseline, 17.8 +/- 0.9 ml/kg. Total blood volume and unstressed vascular volume remained unchanged. With the long-term infusion, both arterial and venous compliance decreased (p less than 0.02) to 0.050 +/- 0.006 and 1.50 +/- 0.06 ml/mm Hg per kg, respectively, such that neither value was different from control.

In addition, inhibitory activity is generated after inhalation challenge. In the present study we have investigated the relationship of heat-labile NCA to the development of the late asthmatic reaction (LAR) in 13 subjects with asthma after allergen challenge and the effects of asthma medication on the formation of this activity. Heat-labile NCA peaked 120 to 240 minutes after challenge and demonstrated at this time significant (p less than 0.001) quantitative relationships to the ensuing LAR. The inhalant corticosteroid, budesonide, significantly inhibited (p less than 0.001) the generation of heat-labile NCA and the development of LAR both after a single dose and after 4 weeks of pretreatment. Single-dose disodium cromoglycate pretreatment, initially, slightly enhanced (p less than 0.05) heat-labile NCA but, after 120 minutes, slightly inhibited (p less than 0.05) the activity. Disodium cromoglycate also slightly abrogated the development of LAR. Single-dose pretreatment with the beta 2-agonist, terbutaline, inhibited generation of heat-labile NCA (p less than 0.001) but was without effect on LAR. It is concluded that the generation of heat-labile NCA is related to the development of the LAR and may be of importance for the attraction of inflammatory cells to the lung in the development of the inflammatory reaction probably responsible for LAR. However, the pharmacologic control of heat-labile NCA indicates that the process is multifactorial and not solely dependent on the generation of NCAs detected in serum.\r"

Sweeteners should be used in the context of an otherwise nutritious and well-balanced diet. Excessive intake of any sweetener requires nutrition counseling for basic nutrition reasons. An individual can minimize potential risks from any one sweetener by using a variety of available sweeteners, thus ingesting less of any specific sweetener. Research into possible risks of long-term uses of non-nutritive sweeteners, either alone or in combination, should continue. It is important that the public have a choice of various non-nutritive sweeteners, with safe and reasonable guidelines on how to use each. As new sweeteners become available, they must receive the same rigorous testing to which previously approved sweeteners have been subjected.\r"

To determine current cardiopulmonary resuscitation policies and procedures in nursing homes, medical directors and directors of nursing service in long-term care facilities in Portland, Oregon, were surveyed. Seventy-five percent responded; of these, only 41% reported having a resuscitation policy. Of those with no policy, 70% thought one was needed. Most nursing homes reported that resuscitation was infrequently discussed with patients and families. When a no-CPR determination was made, it was usually documented in the patient's chart. Training in basic life support was required for registered nurses in two thirds of the facilities. Few homes had equipment necessary for advanced life support. It is recommended that: a) nursing homes develop cardiopulmonary resuscitation policies; b) resuscitation orders be made part of the medical record; and c) nursing home personnel increase their ability to perform basic life support.\r"

  ".W": "Although team-oriented geriatric assessment clinics are growing throughout the country, little documentation exists regarding their clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness, or impact on patient functioning and well-being. This report describes a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a team-oriented geriatric assessment approach compared to traditional care. One hundred-seventeen subjects 65 years of age and over, meeting eligibility criteria to target frail older persons with changing medical and social needs, were randomly assigned to receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment by a multidisciplinary team (treatment) or by one of a panel of community internists who were reimbursed according to their usual and customary fee (controls). Extensive analysis of baseline information failed to identify any significant differences between groups. Over the 1-year follow-up period, treatment participants experienced 26 hospital admissions and used 670 hospital days compared with 23 admissions and 1113 days for controls (a 39.8% difference). Annual hospital costs averaged $4297 for treatment subjects and $7018 for controls. Overall institutional costs including hospital and nursing home care revealed an average saving of $2189 per person for treatment subjects compared with controls, a 25% reduction. A small proportion of subjects accounted for this difference. No significant differences were noted in patient or caregiver satisfaction with the evaluation process, functional ability, or health status. These findings suggest that team-oriented outpatient geriatric assessment provides a promising way to deliver high-quality, satisfying care to older persons without increasing (and possibly decreasing) health care costs.\r"

These are individuals who are in the end-stage of a progressive neurological disease who are noncommunicative, and spend all or most of their time in a recumbent position. We discuss the physiological phenomena existing in these patients that make the probability of aspiration pneumonia as great or possibly greater than with careful spoon feeding. If tube feeding results in the outcome that it is thought to prevent (ie, aspiration pneumonia) then decisions regarding nutritional support in these patients become clinically clearer.\r"

  ".W": "Highly purified human T cells from peripheral blood fail to produce interferon (IFN)-gamma in the absence of accessory cells. The ability of T cells to produce IFN-gamma upon stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or concanavalin A could be restored by the addition of cultured allogeneic human foreskin fibroblasts. Addition of antibodies specific for HLA-DR, DQ, and DP antigens failed to block this accessory function of the fibroblasts. In contrast, antibodies to HLA-DR and DQ antigens inhibited the accessory cell activity of autologous monocytes. Allogeneic fibroblasts failed to exert accessory activity when exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2) was used as the stimulus for IFN-gamma production. In contrast, autologous monocytes were active as accessory cells for IL-2-stimulated T cells. Addition of recombinant human interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) or IL-1 beta to PHA-stimulated T cells co-cultured with fibroblasts stimulated IFN-gamma production. In contrast, preincubation of fibroblasts with IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta caused a dose-dependent suppression of the ability of fibroblasts to augment PHA- and concanavalin A-induced IFN-gamma production by T cells. Preincubation of fibroblasts with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) also reduced their accessory activity. Incubation of fibroblasts with IFN-gamma produced some reduction in their accessory activity and the inhibitory effect of TNF was further enhanced in the presence of IFN-gamma. A 4- to 10-hr incubation of fibroblasts with IL-1 or TNF was sufficient to produce a maximal suppression of accessory activity. Fixation of fibroblasts with formaldehyde decreased their accessory activity, but fixation did not abolish the suppression of accessory function induced by earlier incubation with IL-1. Supernatants of IL-1-treated fibroblast cultures had less suppressive activity than the IL-1-treated fibroblasts per se, and no suppressive activity at all was detected in the supernatants of TNF-treated fibroblasts. Enhanced prostaglandin synthesis may play a role in the IL-1- and TNF-induced suppression of accessory cell function, but other factors are likely to be involved. Our results show that fibroblasts can have a marked effect on T cell function and that IL-1 and TNF can exert immunoregulatory activities indirectly by altering the interactions of fibroblasts with T cells.\r"

Since expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptors is a prerequisite for proliferation, the effect of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists on lymphocyte IL-2 receptors was studied on both mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes and IL-2-dependent T lymphocyte cell lines. In both cell types the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol blocked the expression of IL-2 receptors, as determined with the IL-2 receptor anti-TAC antibody. To determine the effect of beta-adrenergic agonists on expression of the high affinity IL-2 receptors, [125I]IL-2 binding studies were performed at concentrations selective for high affinity sites. No significant effect of beta-adrenergic agonists on high affinity IL-2 receptor sites could be detected. The data demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptor agonists down-regulate IL-2 receptors primarily affecting low affinity sites.\r"

Structural analysis showed that the cleavage occurred between residues 129 and 130 and thus produced a fragment lacking only 11 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The fragmented and untreated molecules showed identical amino-terminal amino acid sequences and were equally reactive with either polyclonal or monoclonal anti-IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma lacking carboxyl-terminal amino acids displayed a 1000- to 2000-fold reduction in its capacity to bind to cellular IFN-gamma receptors at 4 degrees C. Functionally the fragment showed a 50-fold reduction in its ability to induce antiviral activity in fibroblasts and a 10-fold reduction in its ability to induce Fc receptors on the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937. These results thus suggest that the carboxyl terminus of human IFN-gamma contributes significantly to the formation of the receptor-binding site of the molecule.\r"

Hepatocytes and blood monocytes are known to synthesize this protease inhibitor. We studied the regulation of monocyte C1INH production by mediators that are generated during inflammatory responses. Purified blood monocytes spontaneously synthesized and secreted C1INH only after prolonged culture. In the presence of interferon (IFN)-gamma, C1INH was detectable within 24 hr and continued to be released at high levels throughout an 8-day culture period. Monocyte C1INH was newly synthesized and was functionally active as determined by forming stable complex with C1s. Other monocyte stimuli were either less potent (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta) or not capable of increasing C1INH release (lipopolysaccharide, interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor). The second component of complement, C2, was induced by IFN-gamma to a similar extent as C1INH. These findings demonstrate that IFN-gamma is a major regulator of monocyte C1INH production and may warrant consideration of IFN-gamma in the treatment of C1INH deficiency states.\r"

The search for RFLP by using a human C2 probe failed to reveal any variants. However, a Taq I polymorphism was identified with the human Bf probe and Bam HI and Pvu II polymorphisms were identified with the human C4 probe. Overlapping restriction fragments were found with the C2 and Bf probes, which strongly suggests close linkage of C2 and Bf genes in swine. Segregation analyses of the Bf and C4 polymorphisms indicated that the polymorphic fragments followed a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. The recombinant haplotype g, which expresses class I genes of haplotype c and class II genes of haplotype d, was shown to produce an identical RFLP pattern, by using the Bf and C4 probes, as haplotype d, but different from that of haplotype c. This indicates that there is a close association of [C4-Bf-C2] and class II genes in miniature swine. Although these data do not show conclusively the location of the [C4-Bf-C2] genes, it is hypothesized that swine [C4-Bf-C2] genes are located between the class II and class I genes, as has been demonstrated in mouse and man.\r"

With the use of a panel of fluorescent probes, we found that these two growth factors exerted no detectable immediate effect on the resting transmembrane electrical potential, the intracellular concentration of free calcium ions, or the cytosolic pH of isolated, mature granulocytes. However, when granulocytes were \"primed\" by preincubation for 90 min with GM-CSFrh or G-CSFrh, the rate of membrane depolarization induced by 10(-7) M N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, but not the rate of rise in free calcium ions, was greatly accelerated. In examining potential mechanisms to account for the priming effect of these growth factors, we found that although they did not induce translocation of protein kinase C or stimulate significant degranulation, they each directly caused prompt release of arachidonic acid from plasma membrane phospholipids. Our data indicate that although GM-CSFrh and G-CSFrh do not activate the transduction signals that have most clearly been implicated in receptor-mediated activation of cytotoxic functions in granulocytes--namely, those coupled to membrane depolarization or release of intracellular calcium ions--they appear directly to induce the release of arachidonic acid esterified to membrane phospholipids, an event which may represent the receptor-mediated activation of membrane phospholipases and which may contribute to the \"priming\" of the cells for enhancement of their functional responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC), cultured for 2, 7, or 14 days in WEHI-3 conditioned medium in the absence or presence of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, were examined morphologically and for their functional responses to IgE-Fc-mediated and calcium ionophore-mediated activation. The 7- and 14-day fibroblast-adherent and non-fibroblast-adherent populations of cocultured BMMC had more granules per cell and the granule contents were more electron dense than non-cocultured BMMC or BMMC cocultured for only 2 days. The adherent cocultured BMMC were usually located within multiple layers of fibroblasts, but did not form junctions with the fibroblasts. When activated immunologically, the adherent cocultured mast cells generally discharged their granules singly, but compound exocytosis was occasionally seen. Both the non-adherent cocultured BMMC and the BMMC that were cultured in the absence of fibroblasts were similar to one another in that they exocytosed 9 to 11% of their histamine when sensitized with anti-dinitrophenyl IgE and challenged with dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin and 27 to 29% of their histamine when challenged with calcium ionophore. In contrast, adherent cocultured BMMC exocytosed 27 and 61% of their histamine upon immunologic and calcium ionophore activation, respectively, representing a significant two- to three-fold increase relative to that obtained from the other populations of BMMC. When activated immunologically, BMMC cultured in WEHI-3 conditioned medium alone generated a mean of 12 ng of immunoreactive C-6-sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, 1.6 ng of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and 1.0 ng of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)/10(6) cells. The immunologic response of the nonadherent 7-day cocultured BMMC was similar. Fibroblast-adherent cocultured BMMC, on the other hand, generated 56 ng of immunoreactive C-6-sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, 6.4 ng of LTB4, and 5.6 ng of PGD2/10(6) mast cells, representing a significant increase for each product. When calcium ionophore was used as the agonist, the adherent cocultured mast cells also generated significantly more arachidonic acid metabolites than nonadherent cocultured BMMC or BMMC cultured in the absence of fibroblasts. Retention times on high performance liquid chromatography confirmed that the generated immunoreactive products were LTB4, PGD2, and LTC4. Thus, coculture of BMMC with fibroblasts induces an alteration in the composition of the secretory granules of the mast cells, as well as an augmentation of the activation-secretion response of the BMMC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of endogenous arachidonic acid (AA) as the possible second messenger signal in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production, helper cell-depleted mouse spleen cell cultures were treated with the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Treatment with PLA2 from several different animal sources at concentrations between 10 and 300 U/ml resulted in complete, dose-dependent restoration of competence for IFN-gamma production. By comparison, phospholipase C (PLC) from several different species failed to restore competence at concentrations between 0.3 and 30 U/ml; the inability of PLC to provide the helper signal for induction of IFN-gamma was not due to cytotoxicity. Since PLA2 provides competence for IFN-gamma production by sn-2 hydrolysis, it was of interest to identify eicosanoids and other lipids released from [3H]-AA labeled cells by PLA2 and PLC. Treatment of spleen cells with PLA2, but not PLC, resulted in the appreciable release of AA only. Sufficient AA was released from spleen cells for restoration of competence for production of IFN-gamma. All glycerol-derived cell membrane phospholipids examined (phosphatidylethanolamine, -inositol, -choline, and -serine) incorporated labeled AA which was releasable by treatment with PLA2. The data support and extend previous studies which suggested that AA plays a pivotal role in mediation of the interleukin 2 helper signal for IFN-gamma production.\r"

Klausner. 1986. Cell 46:1083). Two kinases are activated in this process: protein kinase C which leads to phosphorylation of the gamma and, to a lesser extent, the epsilon subunits on serine residues and a tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates the p21 subunit (M.D. Patel, L.E. Samelson, and R.D. Klausner. 1987. J. Biol Chem. 262:5831). We sought to determine whether treatment of these cells with NaF could simulate any of these antigen-induced events. Indeed NaF treatment resulted in breakdown of polyphosphoinositides and production of phosphoinositols. This treatment also resulted in a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+. EGTA failed to block this rise suggesting that NaF liberated intracellular stores of Ca2+. Finally NaF treatment resulted in phosphorylation of the gamma and epsilon chains of the T cell receptor indistinguishable from the effects of phorbol esters. The NaF effect was potentiated by addition of A1Cl3 consistent with the view that the active moiety is A1F4-. The A1F4--induced phosphorylations were abolished in cells in which protein kinase C was depleted by prior treatment with phorbol myristate acetate. All of these observations are compatible with the interpretation that the A1F4- phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase C. Antigen and anti-receptor antibody-induced receptor serine phosphorylation and phophatidylinositol turnover are blocked by raising intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. In contrast, A1F4--induced effects were insensitive to cyclic adenosine monophosphate.\r"

  ".W": "Cell-mediated immunity to malaria may involve macrophages, the monokines that mediate endotoxicity, and reactive oxygen species. Since interferon-gamma activates macrophages to release reactive oxygen species, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) helps both to mediate endotoxicity and to induce leukocytes to secrete reactive oxygen, we monitored the effects of administering recombinant forms of these cytokines on Plasmodium chabaudi adami infections in mice. We also fed infected mice a diet containing 0.75% butylated hydroxyanisole, a scavenger of free radicals. Infections were suppressed by daily i.p. injections of 5 x 10(4) U of recombinant mouse interferon-gamma from day -1 or by recombinant human TNF released from i.p. osmotic pumps at the rate of 6 x 10(3) U/hr. Degenerate intraerythrocytic parasites (crisis forms) were evident much sooner in the course of the suppressed infections, and parasitemias fell correspondingly earlier. The butylated hydroxyanisole diet, in contrast, enhanced the infections. In these mice crisis forms were seen later, and at higher parasitemias, than they normally occur. These observations are consistent with the concept that T cell-dependent, macrophage-derived mediators are central to the type of malarial immunity that kills parasites inside circulating red cells. They also suggest, but do not prove, that both TNF and reactive oxygen species are involved, and that the role of TNF may be more indirect, although no less important, than that of reactive forms of oxygen.\r"

The DQ alpha-chain sequence was identical to previously published sequences from the DR4 haplotype, but the DQ beta sequence differed from published DR4-DQ beta sequences obtained from DQw3-positive TA10-negative cell lines by eight amino acids, six of which were located in the beta 1 domain. Thus, the TA10 serologic determinants reside on the DQ beta-chain. A TA10-specific oligonucleotide probe was constructed based on the DQ beta sequence, and its specificity was confirmed in a panel of TA10-positive and TA10-negative cell lines. An additional band was observed in Southern blotting experiments which may indicate a donor sequence for gene conversion.\r"

  ".U": "88060447\r", 
  ".W": "As part of an effort to define the cytotoxic trigger molecules on human myeloid cells, the ability of the different Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma R) to mediate killing of tumor cell lines by monocytes and granulocytes was examined. This was accomplished by studying cytolysis of hybridoma cell (HC) targets bearing surface antibody directed toward the different Fc gamma R. The HC line, HC IV.3A, which bears Ig directed to the low affinity Fc gamma R (Fc gamma RII) on monocytes and neutrophils was lysed by human monocytes. The extent of lysis of HC IV.3A was approximately equal to that of anti-Fc gamma RI (the high affinity Fc gamma R on human monocytes) bearing HC lines (HC 32.2A and HC 62A) and was not augmented by treatment of the monocytes with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In contrast, neutrophils lysed HC IV.3A and HC 32.2A only after activation with IFN-gamma. Since Fc gamma RI is not detectable on untreated neutrophils and is induced by IFN-gamma on these cells, lysis of HC 32.2A by IFN-gamma-activated neutrophils correlated with receptor induction. On the other hand, Fc gamma RII was present at equal levels on untreated and IFN-gamma-treated neutrophils, but only IFN-gamma-treated neutrophils mediated cytotoxicity via Fc gamma RII. In this case, enhanced killing appeared to be due to events other than an increase in Fc gamma RII number. Neither untreated nor IFN-gamma-treated neutrophils mediated the lysis of the anti-Fc gamma RIII bearing HC 3G8A. Thus, binding to the tumor target via this Fc receptor does not lead to lysis and may initiate signals distinct from those triggered through Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII. Surprisingly, HC bearing high amounts of mouse IgG1 antibody of irrelevant specificity were also lysed by monocytes. This lysis was blocked by soluble IV.3 antibody and thus appeared to be due to binding of the Fc portion of the surface Ig to Fc gamma RII on monocytes. Furthermore, monocytes from donors with a form of Fc gamma RII incapable of binding aggregated mouse IgG1 did not lyse these HC, but displayed normal lysis of HC IV.3, demonstrating that this structurally different Fc gamma RII remained a functional trigger molecule. Overall, these studies have demonstrated the specificity of Fc receptors in triggering monocyte- and granulocyte-mediated antibody-dependent tumor cell killing and have begun to dissect functional similarities and differences among the three defined Fc gamma R on human myeloid cells.\r"

Experiments performed in the presence of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA indicated that the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration rise was consequent to an early release of Ca2+ from internal stores, followed by a sustained Ca2+ influx from the extracellular compartment. Moreover, increased levels of inositol-3-phosphate (the putative mobilizer of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores) were observed after stimulation, thus suggesting that activation of this cell subset occurs via the classical inositol-lipid metabolic pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Although cyclosporin A (Cy A) has been widely used clinically as a potent suppressor of organ allograft rejection and has been shown to block T lymphocyte activation in vitro by inhibiting the generation of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and other lymphokines, little direct evidence is available to support the view that the immunosuppressive effects of Cy A in vivo are mediated by a similar inhibition of the autocrine lymphokine cascade. We have used a quantitative assay for the assessment of the role of the IL-2/IL-2 receptor system in the activation of the draining popliteal lymph node population after the injection of allogeneic cells in the footpad to define the effects of Cy A on the early events of lymphocyte activation in vivo and to compare them with the effects of Cy A on lymphocyte activation in vitro. The administration of Cy A in vivo had no effect on alloantigen-induced increases in cell size, percentage of cells expressing the IL-2 receptor, the spontaneous or IL-2-driven proliferation of freshly explanted cells, or the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. These findings raise major questions about the mechanism of action of Cy A in vivo and suggest that more experimentation is required to probe the mechanisms of Cy A-induced suppression of the response to allografts.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking of membrane immunoglobulin, the B cell receptor for antigen, activates the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway. The initial event in this pathway is the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) by phospholipase C. This reaction yields two intracellular second messengers, diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, and inositol trisphosphate, which causes an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+. The experiments reported here demonstrate that activation of phospholipase C by membrane IgM (mIgM) involves a guanine nucleotide-dependent step. Saponin was used to permeabilize WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells and permit direct manipulation of nucleotide and Ca2+ concentrations. Very high levels of Ca2+ (greater than 100 microM) activated the phospholipase maximally without a requirement for cross-linking of mIgM. However, at much lower, physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations (100 to 500 nM), receptor-stimulated PtdInsP2 hydrolysis could be demonstrated. The ability of anti-IgM antibodies to activate phospholipase C in permeabilized WEHI-231 cells was greatly increased by nonhydrolyzable guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) analogues (guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate), but not by guanosine diphosphate or guanosine diphosphate analogues or by a nonhydrolyzable analogue of adenosine triphosphate. This specificity for GTP analogues is consistent with the hypothesis that a GTP-binding regulatory protein analogous to those that couple receptors to adenylate cyclase is involved in the activation of phospholipase C by mIgM in WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells. In order to characterize this putative GTP-binding component, we examined the ability of pertussis toxin and cholera toxin to affect anti-IgM-stimulated inositol phosphate production. These bacterial toxins covalently modify and modulate the activity of various GTP-binding regulatory proteins and in some cell types can block receptor-stimulated PtdInsP2 breakdown. In WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells, neither toxin blocked signaling by mIgM. Thus mIgM appears to be coupled to the phosphoinositide signaling pathway by a GTP-dependent component that is insensitive to both pertussis toxin and cholera toxin.\r"

  ".W": "During the growth of interleukin 2 (IL-2)-dependent T cells IL-2 binding is followed by internalization of the complex between IL-2 and the high affinity IL-2 receptor (HA-IL-2R). The respective role of IL-2 binding to HA-IL-2R and internalization of the complex has been examined. Monoclonal antibody 7D4 (IgM) blocks IL-2-dependent T cell growth although it does not affect IL-2 binding to HA-IL-2R. We show here that 7D4 inhibits T cell growth by blocking IL-2 internalization by HA-IL-2R. In contrast, Fab fragments prepared from 7D4 neither block IL-2 internalization nor inhibit T cell growth. Monoclonal 5A2, that recognizes an epitope related to the IL-2 binding site as well as its Fab fragment, inhibits T cell growth and IL-2 internalization. Monoclonal antibody 7D4, because of its pentameric structure, probably aggregates the IL-2R at the T cell surface and therefore prevents it internalization. The data presented in this paper suggest that simple occupancy of HA-IL-2R by IL-2 is not sufficient to transduce the T cell growth signal; this signal is transmitted only after internalization of the IL-2/HA-IL-2R complex.\r"

IgA enhancement, however, is mediated by a factor distinct from IL-4, although IL-4 can potentiate the effect of the IgA-enhancing factor. IgA-enhancing factor is also distinct from IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma and acts directly on B cells. Purified IgA-enhancing factor enhances IgA production three- to sixfold yet causes less than a twofold increase in other isotypes. The IgA enhancing activity is not inhibited by concentrations of interferon-gamma that inhibit IL-4 activities. In the accompanying article, we show that this IgA enhancing activity is a novel property of the lymphokine IL-5.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that the activation of murine macrophages to a fully tumoricidal state requires that specific environmental signals be delivered to the macrophage in a stepwise manner: a \"priming\" signal first renders the macrophage responsive to a second or \"trigger\" signal. One potent \"priming\" signal has been identified as the T cell-derived lymphokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and one often used \"trigger\" signal is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the endotoxin derived from Gram-negative bacteria. In these studies, endotoxin-responsive C3H/OuJ (Lps(n)) and endotoxin-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ (Lps(d)) macrophages were exposed in vitro to recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) and various preparations of endotoxin or purified lipid A-associated proteins (LAP). The resultant tumoricidal responses were evaluated to define the activation requirements of murine macrophages and to examine further the LPS defect exhibited by C3H/HeJ mice. The findings presented herein demonstrate that C3H/OuJ macrophages primed by rIFN-gamma respond to protein-free LPS (phenol-water extracted LPS), protein-rich LPS (butanol-extracted LPS), or purified LAP. In contrast, rIFN-gamma-primed C3H/HeJ macrophages failed to become cytolytic with phenol-water extracted LPS, but could be rendered fully tumoricidal if either butanol-extracted LPS or LAP were used as \"second signals.\" These data indicate that C3H/HeJ macrophages are fully responsive to the priming effects of IFN-gamma, but remain restricted in their capacity to recognize protein-free LPS as a second signal. Alternate second signals, such as LAP, may provide a compensatory pathway by which these macrophages are rendered fully tumoricidal.\r"

As part of our studies to elucidate the genetic origin and structural features of anti-DNA antibodies, we examined monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)-containing sera from 706 patients for expression of the 8.12 idiotype. We found 41 such sera to have significant 8.12 reactivity (greater than 4 SD above the mean of normal controls) and demonstrated that in 24 of these sera (8 IgM, 14 IgG, and 2 IgA) this reactivity could be localized to the monoclonal protein. In addition, 12 of the 8.12-reactive monoclonal Ig (11 IgG and 1 IgA) bind dsDNA. In the other 17 sera, the 8.12 reactivity could be attributed to polyclonal antibody. These findings provide further evidence that the serum monoclonal Ig frequently express the antigenic and idiotypic reactivities of autoantibodies. Furthermore, these data support the contention that anti-DNA specificity may result from somatic diversification of germ-line Ig gene sequences.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined two galactosyltransferase activities in membrane preparations obtained from resident macrophages, from resident macrophages maintained in culture for 24 hr, and from thioglycollate (TG)-elicited macrophages. Transfer of galactose from uridine diphosphate (UDP)-galactose to N-acetylglucosamine is 2.6 times higher in membranes prepared from TG macrophages (107 +/- 5.5 nmol/hr/mg) than in membranes prepared from resident macrophages (41 +/- 2.0 nmol/hr/mg). Membranes obtained from resident macrophages cultured for 24 hr exhibit a 2.5 times higher activity (102 +/- 4.4 nmol/hr/mg) than membranes from resident cells plated for 4 hr. Transferase activity in membranes derived from TG macrophages is not significantly affected by overnight culture. The transferase reaction product, isolated on Bio-Gel P-4 and analyzed by galactosidase treatments, was identified as galactosyl-beta 1, 4-N-acetylglucosamine. The enzyme, therefore, is UDP-galactose:2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose 4 beta-galactosyltransferase. This is supported by the fact that this galactosyltransferase activity is specifically inhibited by high concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine (200 mM). We have also examined the transfer of galactose to N-acetyllactosamine. Membranes from TG-elicited macrophages contain a UDP-galactose:galactosyl-beta 1, 4-N-acetylglucosamine 3 alpha-galactosyltransferase which synthesizes the trisaccharide, galactosyl-alpha 1, 3-galactosyl-beta 1,4-N-acetylglucosamine. This product was identified by gel filtration chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, and galactosidase digestions. This alpha-galactosyltransferase activity was not detected in membranes prepared from resident macrophages. These results indicate that glycosyltransferase activities are modulated in populations of mouse macrophages, and that these changes correlate with changes in cell surface lactosaminoglycans reported previously.\r"

  ".W": "Although many functions of phagocytes are known to be regulated by guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, phagocytosis itself has not been considered one of these. However, previous studies have examined only unstimulated neutrophil phagocytosis. Motivated by our previous work, which showed that stimulated neutrophil phagocytosis is regulated by GTP-binding proteins (H. D. Gresham, M. G. Peters, and E. J. Brown. 1986. J. Cell Biol. 103:215a), we have examined the effect of pertussis toxin (PT) on monocyte receptor-mediated phagocytosis. PT inhibited unstimulated and fibronectin-stimulated IgG-mediated phagocytosis and also inhibited C3b-mediated phagocytosis stimulated by fibronectin or phorbol dibutyrate. Cholera toxin (CT) had no effect on unstimulated or stimulated phagocytosis mediated by IgG or C3b. PT inhibition of phagocytosis was not mediated via increases in cellular cAMP levels or by inhibition of the respiratory burst. Inhibition of phagocytosis did not result from decreased numbers of plasma membrane opsonin receptors nor decreased ability to bind opsonized targets. Although phorbol ester-stimulated phagocytosis was inhibited by PT, ligand-independent internalization of CR1 stimulated by phorbol dibutyrate proceeded normally in PT-intoxicated cells. We conclude that a PT-sensitive GTP-binding protein does regulate phagocytic function in monocytes. This protein operates on a molecular mechanism specific to the process of ingestion in both unstimulated monocytes and in cells stimulated to increase phagocytosis. Because unstimulated neutrophil phagocytosis is unaffected by PT or CT, and stimulated neutrophil phagocytosis is inhibited by both PT and CT, our data also demonstrate that monocytes and neutrophils have distinct mechanisms for regulation of phagocytic function.\r"

As determined by indirect immunofluorescence, mAb 1.G1 binds to the surface membrane of schistosomula and to the ciliated plates of miracidia. mAb 1.G1 also binds to the protonephridial systems of live adult worms and denuded, acetone-fixed schistosomula. Western blot analysis shows that the target epitope of this mAb is found on Nonidet P-40-solubilized schistosomular antigens ranging in molecular size from 85 to 130 kDa and ciliated plate antigens of miracidia at 92, 95, and 102 kDa. The recognized epitope in an 8 M urea adult worm extract is found on a 97-kDa molecule. In addition, mAb 1.G1 mediates a high level of complement-dependent cytotoxic activity against schistosomula when used in an in vitro assay. In passive immunization experiments, approximately 40% protection was provided mice when mAb 1.G1 was administered either at the time of challenge or when given 8 days postchallenge. However, when administered 15 days postchallenge, mAb 1.G1 failed to mediate passive protection. The ability of mAb 1.G1 to mediate protection in vivo correlates with its recognition of epitopes on the surfaces of live schistosomula up to 8 days but not at 15 days. Western blot analysis showed that the antigens were contained within Nonidet P-40 extracts of schistosomula during the same time period. Furthermore, a second monoclonal antibody (mAb 4.4B) derived from mice chronically infected with S. mansoni exhibits the identical properties as described for mAb 1.G1.\r"

CD8 T cells were the primary activated population representing 24.5% of the total lymphocyte population. The activated CD4 T cells and natural killer cells accounted for 6.7% and 3.5% of the total lymphocyte population, respectively. Analysis of serum soluble interleukin 2 receptors (IL-2R) demonstrated significantly (p less than 0.001) elevated levels in the serum of acute IM patients compared with normal controls. Elevated levels of serum IL-2R were correlated (r = 0.67) with increased percentages of Leu 2a+/HLA-DR+T cells (i.e., activated CD8 T cells). Patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome and virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, two syndromes associated with severe acute EBV infections, demonstrated the most dramatic increase in serum IL-2R levels. These data demonstrate that EBV is associated with intense immune stimulation and that during acute IM activated lymphocytes, other than the CD8 T cells, may contribute to the immune response to EBV.\r"

To evaluate the role of hemolysin (Hly), we used isogenic pairs of Hly+ and Hly- Listeria as antigens. In contrast to live Hly- bacteria, which were presented as well as heat-killed Listeria, live Hly+ bacteria were presented poorly. Hly+ bacteria also inhibited the presentation of heat-killed Listeria. This effect was apparent with as few as 10 bacteria/macrophage and was not due to loss of macrophage viability or decreased Ia expression after exposure to the live bacteria. With respect to murine listeriosis, the LD50 values for the Hly- strains were at least 1000 times higher than those for the Hly+ strains. These results suggest that the ability of Hly+ bacteria to inhibit antigen processing and presentation may be an important determining factor in Listeria infection and immunity.\r"

The role of this exotoxin in the process of T cell activation was studied in vivo during the course of an experimental infection in the mouse. By using highly purified listeriolysin O, it was found that infection with viable, replicative bacteria induced in vivo the emergence of T cells specifically reacting against this exotoxin, as demonstrated by eliciting the expression of delayed-type hypersensitivity to listeriolysin O in Listeria-immune mice. The kinetics of this inflammatory reaction followed the same pattern as that observed with crude Listeria antigenic preparation classically used for the detection of delayed-type hypersensitivity, with a peak of expression by day 6 and a slow decline over the next 3 wk to a residual level, indicating the presence of memory T cells reacting with the exotoxin. This result, therefore, allowed us to identify for the first time that a pure immunogenic molecule secreted by L. monocytogenes is specifically recognized by sensitized T cells induced during the course of infection by L. monocytogenes. The expression of T cell-mediated immunity to listeriolysin O was generated by very low amounts of replicative bacteria, indicating that the exotoxin released in host tissues during the process of intracellular growth is highly immunogenic. Our data favor the view that the binding of listeriolysin O to the membrane cholesterol might be a critical event potentiating the in vivo expression of delayed sensitivity against this exotoxin. Indeed, the insertion of listeriolysin O into the cell membrane induced resistance to enzymatic proteolysis and membrane-bound listeriolysin O was significantly more effective in inducing delayed inflammatory reaction in Listeria-immune mice.\r"

However, the frequency of responsive B cells from E mu-myc donors is only about 30% that of B cells from normal littermates. Thus, enforced myc expression is not sufficient to block the differentiation of all B cells, but a much larger fraction of the immunoglobulin-bearing cells from E mu-myc mice are incompetent. Upon immunization, E mu-myc mice mounted specific antibody responses, although some responses were delayed. Isotype switching can occur, since we observed hemolytic plaques of both IgM and IgG type and detected specific antibody of both classes in the serum. Moreover, the serum from nonimmunized E mu-myc mice contained normal levels of both IgM and IgG. Thus constitutive expression of the c-myc gene appears to retard B cell differentiation, but does not grossly impair immunologic function in the intact animal.\r"

  ".W": "A family of antibodies bearing a common or cross-reactive idiotype, termed CRIC, predominates in the response of most BALB/c mice to the p-azobenzenearsonate (Ar) hapten, but represents a minor component of the anti-Ar response of most A/J mice. Previous results have suggested that the VH region of CRIC is encoded by two different germ-line genes in both strains. We have determined extensive mRNA sequences for VH and VL, developed specific idiotypic reagents and measured affinities for two subfamilies of CRIC, designated CRIC1 and CRIC2. Both were found to be minor components of A/J anti-Ar antibodies, and CRIC1, but not CRIC2, is a major component of the BALB/c response. The two subfamilies utilize different VH germ-line genes but the same, or nearly identical V kappa genes. The VH nucleotide sequences of CRIC1 and CRIC2 exhibit approximately 90% homology. The D regions of both families are short (one or two amino acid residues) and some can be accounted for on the basis of known JH sequences alone. Affinity differences may account for the dominance of CRIA over CRIC1 and CRIC2 in A/J mice, but results obtained with allotype-congenic mice indicate that background (non-V region) genes are also important in controlling levels of expression of the CRIC1 idiotype. Our data suggest that the A/J germline VH gene that gives rise to the CRIC2 family of antibodies may be identical with a previously sequenced BALB/c germ-line VH gene. On the basis of these and earlier data it is suggested that extensive differences between inbred strains of mice in their complements of VH genes do not result from the accumulation of many mutations in these genes. An alternative possibility is that the differences arise from deletions and/or duplications of VH genes.\r"

  ".W": "Herein we have analyzed the expression of idiotopes associated with a monoclonal anti-tumor-associated antigen (TAA) antibody in DBA/2 mice which have progressively growing tumors or resist tumor growth. A panel of eight monoclonal antiidiotypic antibodies raised against a monoclonal antibody which reacts with a mouse mammary tumor virus cross-reactive qp52 envelope protein (TAA) of the L1210/GZL lymphoma was used to measure the expression of idiotopes in sera from different treatment groups. Significant correlations between the expression of certain idiotopes and the growth of the tumor or the establishment of anti-tumor immunity are seen. 1) Idiotypes detected by anti-idiotype D11 are high in anti-idiotype immunized progressor or tumor-susceptible mice and low or absent in regressor mice, i.e., the mice immunized with the protective 2F10 anti-idiotype; 2) the 3A4-detected idiotypes are less frequent or absent in irradiated tumor-immunized regressor mice than in untreated mice challenged with live tumor or progressor mice; 3) no difference in the anti-TAA titers is seen in mice in which the tumor growth is inhibited and in mice in which the tumor grows; 4) no difference in 11C1 idiotype + anti-TAA titer was observed between regressor and progressor mice; and 5) mice with normal or accelerated tumor growth have higher titers of idiotypes detected by a polyclonal anti-idiotype. These findings provide evidence for a regulatory idiotype network induced by the growing L1210/GZL tumor or by anti-idiotypic immunization. The titer of anti-TAA antibody does not correlate with the biology of tumor growth, but certain idiotopes correlate with either progressive or regressive tumor behavior. Therefore, the target of the idiotype regulation is likely to be anti-tumor T effector cells. Effective idiotype therapy of tumors must deal with the complexity of idiotype regulation induced by the tumor itself and is unlikely to be successful if anti-idiotypes are used only as internal mimicry of a TAA.\r"

  ".W": "Murine 3T3 fibroblasts, treated with mitomycin C in order to inhibit their proliferation, have been extensively used as feeder layers to enhance the cultivation of human keratinocytes in vitro. In order to identify possible factors responsible for this enhancing effect, studies were undertaken to determine whether eicosanoid generation by 3T3 cells was preserved following mitomycin C treatment. Accordingly, both untreated and mitomycin C-treated 3T3 cells were incubated with [1-14C]arachidonic acid and their qualitative generation of [1-14C]labeled eicosanoids assessed by thin layer chromatography. Levels of endogenously generated eicosanoids were quantitatively determined by specific radioimmunoassays performed on culture supernatants obtained from incubations of both treated and untreated cells. Results of these studies demonstrate that mitomycin C treatment, although preventing the proliferation of 3T3 cells, failed to alter their generation of prostaglandin E2 or 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. Furthermore, in parallel cultures, the untreated 3T3 cells stopped generating eicosanoids upon reaching confluence, whereas the mitomycin C-treated 3T3 cells that did not proliferate continued to generate eicosanoids.\r"

Recently, nidogen and a low density form of heparan sulfate proteoglycan--two ubiquitous, noncollagenous components of basement membranes--were isolated and characterized, and affinity-purified antibodies to each component were prepared. These antibodies were used to study the distribution of both antigens in normal and diseased human skin. By immunofluorescence, both nidogen and heparan sulfate proteoglycan were linearly distributed along the basement membrane of the dermal-epidermal junction, adnexal structures, and blood vessels of normal human skin. On suction-induced blisters of normal skin, both antigens were found at the base of the blister, indicating that each was within or below the lamina lucida. By indirect immunoelectron microscopy, both antigens were ultrastructurally located within the lamina densa. The staining patterns for nidogen and heparan sulfate proteoglycan were examined in 11 patients with either junctional, dominant dystrophic, or recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, and were found to be not different from the patterns observed in normal skin.\r"

  ".W": "Keratinocytes express Ia antigens in various skin disorders, although the biological role of these Ia antigen-bearing (Ia+) keratinocytes remains unclear. We induced Ia antigens on Pam 212 murine keratinocyte cell line by interferon-gamma(IFN-gamma) and using these cells, we performed the mixed skin lymphocyte culture with syngeneic BALB/c or allogeneic C3H/He splenic T cells. Unexpectedly, Pam 212 cells were found to stimulate both syngeneic and allogeneic T cells irrespective of IFN-gamma treatment. However, both syngeneic and allogeneic T cells cultured with IFN-gamma-treated Pam 212 cells incorporated [3H]thymidine much more actively than those cultured with IFN-gamma-untreated Pam 212 cells. This stimulation was not inhibited by monoclonal anti-I-Ad antibody. Analysis of the responding T cells demonstrated that the syngeneic T-cell stimulation by IFN-gamma-treated Pam 212 cells occurred in both purified Lyt 1-T cells and Lyt 2- T cells. Furthermore, we found that the T cells cultured with the IFN-gamma-treated cells were composed of two morphologically different types of cells. Determination of their surface phenotype showed that the small cell population consisted of 57% Thy-1+, 23% Lyt-1+, 6% Lyt-2+, and 9% asialo-GM1+ cells, while the large cells consisted of 53% Thy-1+, 15% Lyt-1+, 9% Lyt-2+, and 24% asialo-GM1+ cells. These findings suggest that IFN-gamma-treated Pam 212 cells could stimulate more than one kind of splenic T cell populations.\r"

Fibrinogen quantitation showed approximately twice as much immunoreactive as thrombin-clottable protein. The batroxobin and thrombin clotting times of the patient's isolated fibrinogen were prolonged and could not be corrected by mixture with normal fibrinogen. Turbidimetrically assessed fibrin monomer aggregation in response to thrombin, ancrod, or batroxobin and fibrin monomer reaggregation experiments disclosed clearly delayed onset and a lower maximum opacity. In other turbidimetric and clotting-time experiments, the patient's fibrinogen displayed a dose-dependent inhibition of the reaggregation of normal fibrin. Fibrinopeptide A and B release rates and sialic acid content were normal. Assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of reduced samples, the subunit structure of the patient's fibrinogen and its fully cross-linked fibrin was normal. The presence of LA was established by two techniques, the blood thromboplastin inhibition test and the platelet neutralization procedure (PNP). A positive PNP could not be produced by mixing afibrinogenemic plasma with the patient's purified fibrinogen. The patient's inactivated serum and her isolated IgG prolonged the PT and PTT of normal plasma but showed no inhibitory effect on the clotting of purified normal fibrinogen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cyclooxygenase inhibition with ibuprofen caused an increased total solute (Na+, K+, and urea) concentration in the renal papilla. Xenon 133 washout studies revealed no change in medullary blood flow. Ibuprofen induced a 147% increase in papillary Na+ concentration, while increasing urea and K+ only 98% and 35%, respectively, suggesting that a Na+ reabsorption mechanism rather than decreased papillary blood flow was responsible for a majority of the increased papillary solute concentration. A decrease in the excretion of Na+, but not of K+ or urea, in treated dogs further implies increased Na+ reabsorption. Thus, it appears that cyclooxygenase inhibition increases papillary solute concentration primarily by increasing Na+ transport into the papilla.\r"

One hundred fifty pregnancies would undergo amniocentesis with approximately one spontaneous abortion resulting from the procedure. Fifty sets of twins, 86 pregnancies with underestimated gestational age, and 50 pregnancies at risk for low birthweight or fetal death would be identified. All four anencephalics and three of four fetuses with spina bifida would be detected. The benefits to pregnant women of prenatal screening for neural tube defects exceed the risks. At the present incidence of neural tube defects, the cost of prenatal screening to society approximately equals the economic savings. If the incidence of neural tube defects continues to fall, the benefits, risks, and costs will have to be reevaluated. There are insufficient data to determine adequately the benefits, risks, and costs of the screening for Down's syndrome with maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, and such screening should be discouraged.\r"

Specifically, it was found that an increase in dosage of lithium carbonate was associated with a decrease in recognition from the left ear. These data might indicate unilateral hemispheric effects of lithium carbonate on the dysfunctional right hemisphere of patients suffering from bipolar affective disorders.

The commonest lesion noted was a hypodense lesion on unenhanced scan, with a ring or disc-like enhancement on contrast scan, and surrounding hypodensity. This lesion was seen in 39 cases and was more common in patients below the age of 15 years and in those with shorter duration of fits (less than 6 months). Nineteen of these cases had focal signs, 16 showed focal slow activity on EEG and 17/39 had neither signs nor focal slowing on EEG. Ten cases with a ring or disc enhancing lesion had evidence of tuberculosis elsewhere in the body, three more had a past history of tuberculosis and four others had a history of close contact with a case of tuberculosis. After 3 months of antitubercular treatment, 23 out of 25 patients who were rescanned showed clearing of the lesion. The two who did not were operated upon, and the lesion was shown histologically to be a tuberculoma. Ten other cases have done well, but have not been rescanned. Only one case was not treated with antitubercular therapy. She developed fits, altered consciousness, and meningitis and recovered from this serious illness after starting antitubercular therapy. Though not histologically verified, it seems justified to conclude that in India a ring or disc enhancing lesion is the commonest accompaniment of focal epilepsy, and that at least one third (and probably more) of these lesions are tuberculomas.\r"

Stained cells and vessels/mm2 were counted in gray and white matter of four CNS anatomic levels. Class I molecules were found on parenchymal and endothelial cells (approximately 50% of VIII-RA + vessels) but not neurons, and were more abundant in gray than white matter (p less than 0.02). Class I molecules were absent in infants, but in adults expression was unaffected by age, sex, postmortem interval, presence of CNS lesions, or systemic illnesses. Expression of HLA-alpha chain and beta-2 microglobulin were the same. Class II molecules were usually absent but were found on parenchymal and endothelial cells in older adults, most frequently in association with macrophage infiltrates and spinal cord tract degenerations, but not with systemic illnesses. Expression of HLA-DR was greater than that of HLA-DQ. In the human CNS, regulation regulation of expression of MHC molecules is complex, can be affected by age, regional anatomy, and by local or remote CNS lesions, and may influence patterns and degrees of T cell immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was carried out to determine the early structural abnormalities of the cephalic region in a genetic mutant of the rat characterized by prenatal aqueductal stenosis and hydrocephalus. The appearance of hydrocephalic and control embryos was examined on days 13-15 of gestation, and the structure and organization of the neuroepithelium and basal lamina were studied using scanning electron microscopy. In addition to some overall developmental delay, hydrocephalic embryos were characterized by abnormalities of forebrain and midbrain development, and eye and external ear anomalies. There were also associated defects of the midfacial region. The lateral cell surface of the neuroepithelium reflected the developmental delay of hydrocephalic embryos, and failed to undergo the morphogenetic cell-shaping changes seen in control embryos. There were also variations in the number of lateral cell-cell specializations as well as regions of neuroepithelial disorganization and occasional herniation into the mesenchymal compartment. The role of the neuroepithelial basal lamina and extracellular matrix in the development of these defects is considered.\r"

  ".U": "88061461\r", 
  ".W": "We developed a miniature mixing chamber, the bymixer, that aids in the measurement of respiratory gas metabolism and inhalation anesthetic uptake. A small fraction of total respiratory gas flow is bypassed from the inspiratory or expiratory limb of the breathing circuit to the bymixer. We tested the relationship between total flow and bypass flow. To analyze the error and response time of the system, we compared the mixed expired carbon dioxide from the bymixer (capacity, 0.3 L, ratio of bypass flow to total flow, 1/4.5) with that from a conventional 2.0-L mixing chamber in 15 volunteers and 12 anesthetized patients during spontaneous or controlled ventilation. Bypass flow correlated well with total flow (r2 = 0.999 to 1.000) when total flow ranged from 0 to 70 L/min and the ratio of bypass flow to total flow ranged from 1/3 to 1/20. The difference between the values of mixed expired carbon dioxide from the two mixing chambers was small, ranging from -0.03 to 0.01 vol% in both of the ventilatory modes. The relative error was within 2.3% of the carbon dioxide values obtained from the conventional chamber. We observed the error at the lowest minute volume (4 L/min). The 90% response time of the bymixer (24.8 seconds) was similar to that of the conventional chamber (19.1 seconds) at a minute volume of 7.5 L/min. For clinical use, we combined a conventional breathing circuit with two bymixers, one for mixing inspired gas and the other for mixing expired gas. We found this device accurate and easy to use.\r"

  ".W": "The Childrens Cancer Study Group has assessed serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and pubertal development in 97 long-term female survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). All patients received identical induction and maintenance therapy with either 18 or 24 Gy of radiation therapy (RT) to one of the following fields: cranial, craniospinal, or craniospinal plus 12 Gy abdominal RT including the ovaries. Thirty-six percent (35 patients) were found to have above normal levels of FSH and/or LH. The percentages of elevated values for RT fields were 93% for craniospinal plus abdominal RT, 49% for craniospinal RT, and 9% for cranial RT (P less than .001). A dose-response relationship was observed between 18 Gy and 24 Gy in females receiving only craniospinal RT (P = .01). Craniospinal plus abdominal RT and abnormal FSH/LH levels were significantly associated with lack of pubertal development and delayed onset of menses. Duration of maintenance chemotherapy was not associated with abnormal gonadotropin levels or the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Additional follow-up of this cohort is needed to establish the ultimate pubertal development and fertility of these patients.\r"

  ".U": "88061485\r", 
  ".W": "Between October 1980 and December 1985, 50 patients with esophageal cancer were treated with combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil [5-FU] and mitomycin C). Thirty patients with stage I or II disease received definitive treatment consisting of 6,000 cGy in 6 to 7 weeks and 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2/24 h) as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for 96 hours, starting on days 2 and 29. Mitomycin C (10 mg/m2) was administered as a bolus injection on day 2. Twenty patients received palliative treatment (5,000 cGy plus chemotherapy) for stage III or IV disease (extraesophageal spread or distant metastases). All patients treated in this program had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Of the 30 definitively treated patients, 23 had squamous cell cancer, while seven had adenocarcinoma. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 63 months. The complete response rate at 1 to 3 months following completion of treatment was 87% (26 of 30) documented by barium swallow and endoscopy (+/- biopsy). The actuarially determined local relapse-free rate at 1 year and beyond was 73%, and the actuarial survivals at 1, 2, and 5 years were 68%, 47%, and 32%, respectively. Of the 20 palliatively treated patients, ten had squamous cell carcinoma, eight had adenocarcinoma, and two had undifferentiated carcinoma. Seventeen patients were evaluable for freedom from dysphagia 1 or more months following completion of treatment. Eighty-two percent of evaluable patients (14 of 17) had no dysphagia posttreatment, while 64% (11 of 17) remained free of dysphagia until death or last follow-up, emphasizing the significant local control of those patients. The median survival for this group was 8 months. Treatment was well tolerated, and acute toxicity included esophagitis, stomatitis, oral candidiasis, and hematologic toxicities of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Late toxicities were predominantly manifested as a mild to moderate benign stricture, which required dilatation in four patients. One patient developed a perforation into the mediastinum in the absence of tumor, while two patients with persistent local disease developed tracheoesophageal fistula, and radiation pneumonitis was observed in two patients. This combination of radiation therapy with infusional 5-FU and mitomycin C is an effective and relatively well-tolerated regimen in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Surgical resection may not be necessary when high-dose radiation and chemotherapy are used.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients with documented metastatic melanoma were randomly assigned to receive recombinant DNA-produced gamma-interferon (specific activity approximately, 20 MU/mg) intravenously (IV) over either two or 24 hours at dosages of 3, 30, 300, 1,000, or 3,000 micrograms/m2. Objective toxicity resembled that of alpha-interferon and included fever, chills, myalgias, headache, and fatigue. Neutropenia, elevations in liver enzymes, tachyarrhythmias, and CNS changes also were noted. Dose-limiting toxicity included neutropenia, liver enzyme abnormality, constitutional symptoms, and a change in mental status. The incidence of toxicity was qualitatively similar in both two- and 24-hour treatment arms, but was quantitatively more severe in the 24-hour continuous infusion arm. Maximum tolerated dose was 1,000 micrograms/m2 in both schedules. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a half-life of six to nine hours. One patient had a complete response after two cycles of therapy and an additional patient entered partial remission after three cycles. Recombinant gamma-interferon (rIRN-gamma) is tolerated at dosages of 1,000 micrograms/m2 administered daily either by two or 24 hour infusion for 14 days in patients with metastatic melanoma. The responses documented in this early trial warrant further evaluation for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.\r"

  ".U": "88061490\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor colony-forming cells were grown from fresh biopsy specimens from 102 patients with a variety of nonhematologic malignant neoplasms and exposed in vitro to pharmacologically achievable doses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rTNF). In 68 instances, the tumor specimens were also tested against recombinant human gamma-interferon (rIFN-gamma), as well as the combination of rTNF and rIFN-gamma. rTNF exhibited dose-dependent and tumor-type-dependent antitumor effects. Sensitivity to rTNF at doses of less than 100 U was observed in 28% of the tumors tested. A higher than average frequency of sensitivity was observed in colorectal and lung cancer. Resistance to rTNF was observed in 42% of the tumors, including 52% of the ovarian cancer specimens tested. In paired experiments, exposure of tumor specimens to rTNF and rIFN-gamma in combination often resulted in a greater antitumor effect than was observed with either agent alone, with at least subadditive effects seen in 62% of the specimens tested against the combination. Antagonism between rTNF and rIFN-gamma was observed in 18% of the studies. Overall, exposure to the combination of rTNF and rIFN-gamma reduced the dose of rTNF required for significant antitumor activity by about threefold. Normal bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells were also tested against both rTNF and rIFN-gamma and the combination. The bone marrow progenitors were more sensitive to rTNF and the combination with rIFN-gamma than were the tumor cells; however, the significance of this comparison between two different in vitro assay systems is indeterminate. Based on our observations, rTNF warrants phase II clinical trials in selected solid tumors with definite emphasis on colorectal and lung cancer. Additionally, studies of the combination of rTNF and rIFN-gamma are indicated and will be of particular interest in endometrial and breast cancer.\r"

It differs from methotrexate in its transport and intracellular retention, and may be useful against tumors resistant to methotrexate because of impaired transport or deficient polyglutamylation. In preclinical studies, it has demonstrated a broader spectrum of antitumor activity than methotrexate, and appears to have synergistic antitumor activity when combined with a number of other agents. In clinical trials, the primary toxicity has been hematologic, with rapid recovery and no evidence of cumulative dose effect. Nonhematologic toxicity has been sporadic. Preliminary results of phase II trials indicate activity against breast, non-small-cell lung, and head and neck tumors. In addition, trimetrexate with simultaneous leucovorin rescue appears to be a promising new treatment for pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS patients, with minimal toxic side effects.\r"
