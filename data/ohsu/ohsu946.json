MRI systems currently in use at many hospitals can be used effectively in the routine, clinical evaluation of many forms of cardiovascular disease, including great vessel disease, ischemic cardiac disease and congenital cardiac disease. Moreover, quantitative and cine MRI techniques are now available, which provide highly accurate measures of chamber size, wall motion and wall thickening. Recent developments in the areas of myocardial tagging, high-speed imaging and MR assessments of flow and perfusion suggest potential for an increasing role of MRI in the clinical evaluation of the cardiovascular system.\r"

Animal studies have provided the basis for understanding changes in high-energy phosphates with myocardial ischemia. Studies of graded ischemia due to partial coronary stenosis have shown the sensitivity of the ratio of phosphocreatinine to inorganic phosphate to small reductions in myocardial blood flow and its relation to myocardial function. The application of NMR spectroscopy to humans requires precise localization techniques to avoid acquiring contaminating information from structures around the heart, such as the chest wall and diaphragm. With these localization techniques, metabolic evidence of ischemia has been demonstrated in patients with myocardial infarction and patients with known coronary disease, although the sensitivity of this technique for the diagnosis of inducible ischemia is unknown. At rest, patients with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies often have an elevated phosphodiester resonance, possibly signifying abnormal breakdown of membrane phospholipids. Increasing oxygen demand in these patients does not usually alter high-energy phosphates, suggesting that oxidative energy metabolism is preserved under these conditions. NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to increase understanding of metabolic changes in a variety of pathologic conditions.\r"

Furthermore, no standard noninvasive method provides reliable diagnostic information on the location of the coronary arteries involved, the severity of stenosis, the presence of collaterals and myocardial viability. Based on greater than 1,000 cardiac studies at the University of Texas, cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) with either generator-produced rubidium-82, cyclotron-produced N-13 ammonia, or F-18 deoxyglucose is suitable for 4 routine diagnostic purposes: (1) noninvasive diagnosis of CAD in either symptomatic or asymptomatic subjects with a sensitivity of 95 to 98% and specificity of 95 to 100%. This accuracy is now sufficient to schedule diagnostic catheterization and multivessel angioplasty with surgical backup on the basis of the PET scan. At the University of Texas we carry out PET in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients to direct those with mild disease to cholesterol-lowering reversal therapy and those with severe disease to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA); (2) assessment of physiologic severity of coronary artery stenosis as compared to automated quantitative coronary arteriographic analysis. Changes in stenosis severity are followed before and after interventions including PTCA, bypass surgery, vasodilator drugs and cholesterol control regimens for reversal of coronary atherosclerosis; (3) imaging myocardial infarction, ischemia, viability, zone at risk and sizing of these pathophysiologic processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, tissue characterization of the pathophysiologic state of the myocardium may require special indicators or MR contrast agents. These must be tailored for detection by the MRI process, but available agents are effective at low dose and provide a wide range of indicator properties (e.g., myocardial extracellular space, blood pool, capillary permeability and membrane transport). Each agent has a dynamic washin and washout time-intensity curve that may reflect myocardial perfusion or consequences of ischemia. The combined use of MRI and MR contrast agents may provide a single diagnostic examination that fully and quantitatively assesses all indexes of cardiac performance. Such information would be both global and regional, and would be well tolerated by patients. The cost, value and cost-effectiveness of such studies remain speculative.\r"

Pharmacologic actions of currently used radiographic contrast agents are determined principally by 3 physicochemical properties of the iodine-bearing molecule and its formulation: osmolality, sodium concentration and calcium-binding properties. Within this framework, the calcium-binding 1.5 ratio agents have the most marked effects, and the 3.0 ratio nonionic agents the least, with the noncalcium-binding formulations of 1.5 ratio agents and ioxaglate (the only 3.0 ratio ionic agent) in between. Differences in hemodynamic effects are predominantly related to osmolality with the 3.0 agents causing less hemodynamic disturbance. The magnitude of difference is small enough that the 3.0 ratio agents have no important clinical advantage when used in patients with good or moderately impaired left ventricular function. However, the difference may be important in patients with severely impaired circulatory performance. The principal electrophysiologic differences are between the calcium-binding 1.5 ratio agents (which are associated with a clear-cut greater frequency of ventricular fibrillation during coronary injection than the noncalcium-binding 1.5 ratio agents) and the 3.0 ratio agents. There is no justification for the use of calcium-binding 1.5 ratio agents, since noncalcium-binding formulations of the same molecule are available at the same price. The circulatory reserve of most patients makes the differences between 3.0 ratio agents and noncalcium-binding 1.5 ratio agents clinically unimportant. In view of the substantial price disparity between 1.5 ratio and 3.0 ratio agents, noncalcium-binding 1.5 ratio agents are appropriate for patients with good circulatory performance and 3.0 ratio agents are best reserved for patients with impaired circulatory performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients presented in 1982 to 1984 with new coronary heart disease, and control subjects were a probability sample of eligible hypertensive enrollees free of coronary heart disease. With the investigators blind to case-control status, the subjects' medical records were reviewed for other coronary risk factors, and the health-maintenance organization's computerized pharmacy database was used to ascertain the use of beta blockers. A larger proportion of controls than cases were using beta blockers. This difference was confined to the subgroup with nonfatal myocardial infarctions. For current use, the estimated relative risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction was 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.99). Among current users of beta blockers, higher doses conferred greater protection. Past use and total lifetime intake of beta blockers were only weakly associated with case-control status. The current use of beta blockers may prevent first events of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with high blood pressure.\r"

The records of the Framingham Heart Study allowed more comprehensive analysis of the time of sudden cardiac death. In this study, a prominent circadian variation was also identified in which frequency of sudden cardiac death increased sharply between 6 A.M. and 9 P.M.; distribution was fairly even throughout the rest of the day. This circadian pattern may be explained in part by physiologic changes that increase the likelihood of ventricular fibrillation or increase the risk of thrombosis in the morning hours. The possible role of the morning increase in physical and mental activity as a trigger of sudden cardiac death requires further investigation.\r"

Whether those factors that contribute to reversible ischemic events are similar to those causing infarction and sudden death has not been resolved.

During administration of placebo, ischemic time and heart rate showed a primary peak with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours with a tight coupling between the 2 variables and a secondary peak with a periodicity of 5 to 8 hours. During metoprolol therapy, heart rate and ischemic variation were reduced and the 24-hour periodicity for heart rate only remained.

In an experimental setting, the effect of mental stress on hemodynamics and left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (as detected by radionuclide ventriculography) was measured in 29 patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Seventy-five percent of the patients demonstrated mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities. Patients frequently exhibited greater increases in peak systolic arterial pressure during mental stress than during exercise. Personally relevant mental stress is the most potent type of mental stress, both in terms of frequency and magnitude of ischemia. Most mental stress-induced ischemic episodes are clinically and electrocardiographically silent and occur at heart rates significantly lower than those seen during exercise. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased during mental stress-induced ischemia, suggesting that increased myocardial oxygen demand plays a role in the pathophysiology of mental stress-induced transient ischemia. The significant magnitude and acute onset of this mental stress-induced blood pressure elevation may in some manner contribute to atherosclerotic plaque rupture. These findings may provide a pathophysiologic link to the epidemiologic association between mental stress and acute ischemic coronary events. A new ambulatory radionuclide detector that can concurrently monitor left ventricular ejection fraction and electrocardiographic ST-segment change may enhance the detection and evaluation of transient myocardial ischemia in ambulatory coronary patients.\r"

These studies, repeatedly confirmed, revealed that the thrombi are triggered by microscopic cracks in the collagen cap of advanced plaques. Blood most often seeps from the arterial lumen through the cracks into the underlying lipid gruel before the breaks or cracks are plugged by the thrombi (which function as hemostatic seals of the breaks). These results are parallel to results of experimental studies in which the synergism of endotheliotoxic and pressor agents produced thrombi over cap breaks and sub-break hemorrhages only in arteries with advanced collagen-rich plaques, not in arteries with early atherosclerosis or in normal vessels. This finding indicates that advanced atherosclerosis makes the arterial wall much more fragile and that, once broken, this wall exposes the blood to powerful thrombogenic materials that do not exist in normal arterial tissue. At present, human and experimental evidence suggest that the thrombogenic fissures of advanced plaque caps can be promoted by several factors, such as a surge in intraarterial pressure or insults that damage the caps structurally and increase their vulnerability to any type of stress such as certain metabolic, exogenous chemical and immune insults, spontaneous molecular changes of collagen with time and hemorrhages of capillaries that invade advanced plaques from the adventitia or the arterial lumen.\r"

Now, cinemicrographic studies using silicone polymer injections in cleared human hearts have identified the vasa vasorum of coronary arteries, revealing evidence of neovascularization in the region of atherosclerotic plaques. These studies suggest an important role for the vasa vasorum in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis and its sequelae, especially intramural hemorrhage and vascular spasm. The wall of the human coronary artery in regions of atherosclerotic injury may be particularly rich in capillary vessels of the vasa vasorum. From this, the evidence suggests that with the morning increase in blood pressure, fragile neovascular structures of the vasa vasorum may be more prone to rupture and may be responsible, in part, for the circadian variation in myocardial infarction.\r"

An atherosclerotic coronary artery lesion can, therefore, have 2 important characteristics. First, it may be obstructive. Second, it may be \"vulnerable\" in that it has the potential to become thrombogenic if exposed to the appropriate triggering stimulus. A lesion need not be obstructive to become thrombogenic, nor do all obstructive lesions have thrombogenic potential. The cause of an infarction may thus be rupture of a nonobstructive plaque leading to occlusive thrombus formation. Because it may be difficult to predict the site of a subsequent occlusion from a coronary angiogram, coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty directed only at discernible stenotic lesions may not be effective for preventing subsequent myocardial infarctions. Appropriate therapy may need to be directed at the entire coronary tree. Such therapy might include cholesterol lowering, beta blockade and aspirin.\r"

Factors potentially responsible for the conversion from chronic to acute coronary artery disease include endothelial injury at sites of stenosis. The endothelial injury may be the result of plaque fissuring or ulceration, hemodynamic factors (including systemic arterial hypertension or flow shear stress), infection, smoking, coronary arteriography or balloon angioplasty. Clinical and experimental animal studies suggest that interference with thromboxane and serotonin contributions to platelet aggregation and dynamic coronary artery constriction may prevent chronic coronary artery disease syndromes from converting to acute disease. To protect against this process may require both thromboxane and serotonin receptor antagonists or a combination of thromboxane synthesis inhibitor and receptor antagonist with a serotonin receptor antagonist. Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis.\r"

Nadolol, with a plasma half-life of 15.5 hours, had the most pronounced heart rate-lowering effect 24 hours after the daily dose compared to pindolol, which had a half-life of 5.5 hours. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, nadolol and atenolol had similar effects 3 to 4 hours after the daily dose. Nadolol, however, produced greater suppression of heart rate and double product (blood pressure x heart rate) than atenolol (compared to placebo) 24 hours after ingestion of the daily dose. On ambulatory electrocardiography 24 hours after medication administration, 80 to 100% of the heart rate-attenuating effect of nadolol was maintained versus only 20 to 45% of atenolol's effect. Statistically significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in heart rate were produced by nadolol, but not by atenolol, between 4 and 5 A.M., 6 and 7 A.M., 8 and 9 A.M. and 9 and 10 A.M. Furthermore, nadolol remained at 52% of peak blood level at 24 hours, whereas atenolol was at 20%.

  ".W": "Clinical observations suggest that beta-adrenergic blocking agents can modify the circadian occurrence of a variety of ischemic events. Morning awakening is associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure and pulse, serum catecholamine content and platelet activation, at a time of decreased blood thrombolytic activity. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have the potential to modify many of these events. Current data indicate that these agents modify blood pressure and pulse, but do not prevent their early morning increase. In addition, beta-adrenergic blocking agents decrease ventricular ectopy and its circadian variation. Recent studies in humans indicate, however, that metoprolol does not affect the circadian increase in platelet activity or serum catecholamines. The specific mechanism by which beta blockers affect the circadian occurrence of ischemic events remains uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown definitely to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction. The mechanisms to explain this protective action of beta blockers have never been elucidated conclusively, and include the antiarrhythmic and myocardial oxygen demand-reducing effects of the drugs. An antithrombotic mechanism has also been suggested. However, beta blockers have relatively weak antiplatelet activity, suggesting that their antithrombotic effects may be related to prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability of beta blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surges, may protect a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque from fracture, thereby reducing risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction and death.\r"

  ".W": "Circadian variation of onset of acute myocardial infarction has been noted in many studies and may carry important implications. However, only a few previous studies have attempted subgroup analysis. In 4,796 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction, the time of symptom onset was recorded. As in other studies, a peak occurred in the morning hours from 6 A.M. to noon with 28% of the population (1.16 times the average percent for the other time periods) experiencing symptom onset in that period (p less than 0.001). There was a second lower peak (25%) in the evening hours between 6:01 P.M. and midnight, also observed in some previous studies. Whether the presence of subgroups with specific clinical characteristics would exhibit different patterns and thereby contribute to these peaks in the overall population was then determined. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure (n = 606) or with non-Q-wave infarction (n = 832), a pronounced peak (29%) occurred only in the evening hours. In patients greater than 70 years of age (n = 1,422), smokers (n = 2,057), diabetics (n = 767), women (n = 1,213) and patients taking beta blocking drugs (n = 847), 2 nearly equal peaks were observed. Finally, in patients with previous myocardial infarction (n = 1,104), no peaks were observed. In a subgroup of patients (n = 1,084) free from the most important modifying factors, there was a single very pronounced late morning peak (32%), 1.39 times the average percent for the other time periods (p less than 0.001), without evidence of a second evening peak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 97 patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina and ambulatory electrocardiographic data were evaluated. Of the 86 patients with a positive exercise test, 39 (group 1) had greater than or equal to 1 episodes of ST-segment depression and 47 (group 2) did not develop ST changes during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Comparison of the exercise test parameters between the 2 groups revealed early onset of ischemia during exercise tests as the single most significant (p less than 0.0005) predictor of ambulatory silent ischemia. The other exercise test parameters showing significant differences between the 2 groups were the peak exercise heart rate (117 +/- 23 vs 126 +/- 20 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and peak systolic blood pressure (160 +/- 27 vs 176 +/- 27 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), both of which were significantly lower in the group 1 patients. These data were used to derive simple mathematical formulas for calculating the risk of ambulatory silent ischemia. These results demonstrate that stable angina patients at risk of silent ischemia during daily life can be accurately identified by evaluation of selected exercise test parameters.\r"

A treadmill exercise test and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained at the end of each treatment period.

Clinical and hemodynamic effects observed during dipyridamole infusion were not predictive of transient cavitary dilation on the thallium images. Coronary angiography was performed in 32 of the 45 patients: 75% had either left main, 3-vessel or \"high-risk\" 2-vessel coronary artery disease. Although 25 of 45 patients (56%) with transient cavitary dilation were either asymptomatic or had only grade 1/4 effort angina, 16 of 25 patients (64%) not referred for coronary revascularization sustained a cardiac event during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Most events were cardiac deaths (75%) and 87% of events occurred within 4 months of the test. Noncardiac surgery was performed in 187 of the 510 patients. The postoperative cardiac event rate was 2% in the 101 patients with normal scans or fixed defects, 19% in 75 patients with reversible perfusion defects and 58% in 12 patients with reversible cavitary dilation (p less than 0.0001). Thus, transient LV dilation during dipyridamole-thallium imaging is a marker of severe underlying coronary artery disease, denotes a poor prognosis and predicts a high risk of postoperative cardiac complications in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery.\r"

The current study compares the long-term effects of 2 different fish oil preparations (ethyl ester and triglyceride) versus olive oil in patients with coronary artery disease. Eighty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to receive capsules containing 6 g/day (triglyceride group) or 7 g/day (ethyl ester group) of n-3 fatty acids, or capsules containing 12 g/day of olive oil for 6 months. Mean triglyceride levels decreased by 28% in the ester and 32% in the triglyceride fish oil groups (p less than 0.05 for both). LDL cholesterol levels increased by 3% (difference not significant) in the ester and 12% (p less than 0.05) in the triglyceride fish oil groups; in hypertriglyceridemic subjects the increase was 23% (p less than 0.01) and 14% (difference not significant), respectively. Plasma phospholipid fatty acid analysis showed a fivefold increase in eicosapentaenoic acid levels in both fish oil groups (p less than 0.001), and a long-term decrease in arachidonic acid levels (p less than 0.001). Achieved eicosapentaenoic acid level correlated with the degree of increase in LDL cholesterol (r = 0.38, p less than 0.05). These data suggest that fish oil administration is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol levels in a diverse group of patients with coronary artery disease; this change appears to be correlated with n-3 fatty acid absorption. The impact of this increase in LDL is unknown, but should be considered as potentially adverse.\r"

Lipoproteins were measured and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] was also assayed in a subset of 98 patients with CAD. Statistical analysis was performed using uni- and multivariate techniques to test the association among age, gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, family history, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and apo B, ratio of apo A-I to apo B, and ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol, to Lp(a) and to CAD. All factors except gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking were univariate predictors of CAD. Multivariate predictors were, in decreasing order of significance, family history, age, HDL/total cholesterol ratio and apo B. When Lp(a) was included, multivariate predictors were age, family history, apo B and Lp(a), in that order. Lipid parameters alone showed that the HDL/total cholesterol ratio and that Lp(a) provide the best predictive tests for the detection of CAD in this referral population and may ultimately become important screening tests for CAD.\r"

Therefore, this investigation was undertaken to measure 12-lead QRS voltage sum, a recently proposed (Am J Cardiol 1985;55:485-494) index of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and its ability to predict either subsequent sudden (less than 2 hours) or nonsudden CAD death during 20 to 23 years of follow-up in 1,588 middle aged men (40 to 61 years old) from 2 cohorts of the Italian section of the Seven Countries Study who were free of demonstrable CAD (at entry examination in 1962). The Sokolow-Lyon and the modified Sokolow-Lyon indexes, 2 standard electrocardiographic methods to detect LV hypertrophy were also measured and compared. During follow-up, 67 patients died suddenly and 87 died a nonsudden CAD death. In the Cox proportional-hazards model, age, mean blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, cholesterol, physical activity, smoking habit, ST-T alterations (Minnesota codes 4.1 to 4.3 together with 5.1 to 5.3) and the 3 electrocardiographic indexes, all measured at the time of enrollment into the study, were included. The 12-lead QRS voltage sum retained significant and independent relation to sudden death (t = 2.00); Sokolow-Lyon index entered the Cox solution for nonsudden CAD death but the association was inverse (t = -2.10). ST-T alterations were significantly associated only with nonsudden CAD death (t = 2.19). Thus, in addition to several known risk factors, measurement of 12-lead QRS voltage sum in middle-aged men without clinical evidence of heart disease may help identify subjects at an increased risk of sudden death; nonsudden CAD death is predicted by Sokolow-Lyon index and by ST-T alterations. The usefulness of these indexes needs to be tested in different populations.\r"

A total of 648 arterial segments were measured, yielding a highly significant correlation between videodensitometry and caliper-determined cross-sectional area (r = 0.96, p = 0.0001). Similarly, a highly significant linear relation was observed between videodensitometry and caliper-determined diameter (r = 0.95, p = 0.0001). When data subsets for small, medium and large arterial segments were examined, higher variability in the correlation between videodensitometry and caliper-determined area was observed in the large segments (greater than 10 mm2). In addition, caliper-estimated areas tended to be slightly smaller than videodensitometry-estimated areas in these segments. For diameter estimations, correlations between caliper and videodensitometry data were similar for the entire range of arterial segment sizes. Intra- and interobserver variability was low for both caliper and videodensitometry determination of diameter or area. Thus, over a wide range of arterial dimensions, results obtained with caliper estimates of luminal area and diameter are comparable to those obtained with videodensitometry using the XR-70 system.\r"

Since indium-111 monoclonal antimyosin antibody scintigraphy has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for myocardial necrosis, even in small lesions, uptake of this radiotracer was evaluated after CABG. In 23 consecutive patients without previous myocardial infarction who underwent CABG for stable angina, 80 MBq indium-111 antimyosin was injected on the third postoperative day. Planar images were obtained 48 hours later and analyzed for myocardial uptake of indium-111 antimyosin. Scintigraphic results were related to creatine kinase MB levels, duration of both aortic cross-clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass, and electrocardiographic changes. In all patients surgical procedure and postoperative course was uncomplicated. Indium-111 antimyosin uptake was present in 19 of 23 patients (82%). It was diffused in 7 patients and localized in 12. No pathologic Q waves occurred postoperatively. Fourteen patients exhibited ST-segment changes. No good relation was found among indium-111 antimyosin uptake and creatine kinase MB levels, duration of cross-clamping or bypass, and ST-T changes. It is concluded that some degree of myocardial damage, though silent, is common after CABG.\r"

After a mean follow-up of 24 months, 16 patients developed sustained symptomatic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, 7 patients were resuscitated from an episode of ventricular fibrillation, and 10 patients died suddenly. Multivariate regression analysis using continuous variables showed that the strongest predictor of sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was the left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.0001) followed by the duration of QRS complex on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram recorded during the first 3 days of AMI (p less than 0.0005). Sudden death was only predicted by left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.02).\r"

To determine whether this use also applies to patients after thrombolytic treatment of AMI, 64 patients who underwent early thrombolytic therapy for AMI and 107 patients without acute intervention were evaluated. The ability of both the electrocardiogram and thallium tests to predict future events was compared in both groups. After a mean follow-up of 374 days, there were 25 and 32% of cardiac events in the 2 groups, respectively, with versus without acute intervention. These included death, another AMI, coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty with 75% of the events occurring in the 3 months after the first infarction. The only significant predictors of outcome were left ventricular cavity dilatation in the intervention group and ST-segment depression and increased lung uptake in the nonintervention group. The sensitivity of exercise thallium was 55% in the intervention group and 81% in the nonintervention group (p less than 0.05). Therefore, in patients having thrombolytic therapy for AMI, nearly half the events after discharge are not predicted by predischarge low-level exercise thallium testing. The relatively weak correlation of outcome with unmasking ischemia in the laboratory before discharge may be due to an unstable coronary lesion or rapid progression of disease after the test. Tests considered useful for prognostication after AMI may not necessarily have a similar value if there has been an acute intervention, such as thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Patients with primary VF resembled counterparts without VF in terms of age, gender, frequency of previous AMI and past cigarette smoking habits. The hospital course of patients with primary VF revealed increased incidence of primary atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular block. Increased serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase were noted among the patients with primary VF. In-hospital mortality rate was 18.8% in 122 patients with primary VF compared with 8.5% in 3,707 patients forming the reference group (p less than 0.01). Adjustment by age using logistic function yielded an estimate of 2.86 for relative mortality odds associated with primary VF, and further adjustment by gender, history of AMI, systemic hypertension, and by enzymatically estimated infarct size slightly reduced the estimated odds, at 2.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 4.46). Prognosis after discharge from the hospital was independent of primary VF. In conclusion, primary VF exerts an independent, significant effect on in-hospital mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful in controlling excessive ventricular rate in chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) but often reduce exercise capacity. To investigate the advantage of labetalol--a unique beta blocker with alpha-blocking property--in chronic AF, 10 patients without underlying structural heart disease were studied with treadmill test, 12-minute walk and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients were randomized and crossed over to receive 4 phases of treatment (placebo, digoxin, digoxin with half-dose labetalol, and full-dose labetalol). Exercise durations were 14.1 +/- 1.5, 14.2 +/- 1.5, 16.1 +/- 1.1 and 15.6 +/- 1.1 minutes, respectively, indicating that labetalol did not reduce exercise tolerance. Although digoxin had no advantage over placebo in controlling maximal heart rate (177 +/- 2 vs 175 +/- 3 beats/min), labetalol, both as monotherapy or as an adjunct to digoxin, was advantageous (156 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, and 154 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, respectively). The rate-pressure product was consistently lowered by labetalol at rest and during exercise. At peak exercise, the addition of labetalol to digoxin reduced the maximal rate-pressure product achieved from 30,900 +/- 1300 to 24,100 +/- 2,000 mm Hg/min (p less than 0.01) and the maximal rate-pressure product was lowest with full-dose labetalol (22,300 +/- 1,600 mm Hg/min). During submaximal exercise on treadmill or during the 12-minute walk, the combination of labetalol and digoxin produced the best heart rate control, whereas labetalol monotherapy was comparable to digoxin therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Successful surgical ablation of atrioventricular (AV) accessory connections may be confirmed during postoperative electrophysiologic testing by the absence of accessory connection conduction in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. Whereas the former may be readily apparent by examination of the surface electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing, assessment of the latter may be complicated by the frequent presence of enhanced retrograde AV nodal conduction in the postoperative period. Consequently, availability of interventions that selectively affect AV nodal conduction and refractoriness without concomitant effects on accessory connections may be helpful for assessing the success of the surgical procedure. In this study the effects of combined propranolol and verapamil administration on electrophysiologic properties of the AV node and the accessory AV connection were assessed both pre- and postoperatively in 17 patients (12 men and 5 women, mean age 33 years) undergoing surgical ablation of accessory connections. Preoperatively, electrophysiologic characteristics of all but 1 of the accessory AV connections were unaffected by propranolol and verapamil administration. Postoperatively, on the other hand, propranolol and verapamil significantly prolonged both the retrograde AV node effective refractory period (baseline: 272 +/- 34 ms vs after drugs: 384 +/- 70 ms [p less than 0.0001]) and the shortest cycle length maintaining 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction (baseline: 357 +/- 99 ms vs after drugs: 485 +/- 64 ms [p less than 0.0001]). Late postoperative electrophysiologic evaluation (7 +/- 3 weeks) revealed no evidence of residual accessory AV connection conduction, and all patients remain asymptomatic at 21 +/- 10 months follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of oral mexiletine on left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) and ventricular arrhythmias--and a possible relation between these effects--were evaluated during 3 months of therapy in 29 patients with chronic ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) and a moderately reduced to normal LVEF by 24-hour Holter monitoring and by radionuclide ventriculography at rest and during maximum tolerable exercise testing. After an average titration period of 13 days, a mean daily mexiletine dose of 739 mg was maintained throughout the treatment. At the end of titration and after 3 months of treatment, patients with a baseline LVEF less than or equal to 40% (group 2) responded with a median reduction of the hourly VPC rate by 90 and 81%, respectively, compared with 79 and 72% in those with a baseline LVEF greater than 40% (group 1). Couplets and runs of ventricular tachycardia were almost completely suppressed in nearly all patients. A single patient had a proarrhythmic increase in VPCs during treatment. Compared with baseline, there were no significant changes in resting or exercise LVEF after 1 or 3 months of treatment in either of the 2 groups of patients. No correlation was found between treatment-induced changes in arrhythmia frequency and in resting EF. No symptoms of congestive heart failure developed. The study confirms that long-term use of mexiletine is efficacious and relatively free of cardiac depressant effects even in patients with diminished LV function.\r"

The intraarterial recording was commenced 24 hours before the first 4-mg dose and was continued for a further 24 hours thereafter. After dose titration and chronic therapy, a second 24-hour ambulatory BP recording was made. There was a steady onset of drug action, maximal at 2 hours, but with reflex tachycardia after the first dose. Chronic administration reduced BP throughout the 24-hour period, without tachycardia. Mean daytime reduction in BP was 20 mm Hg systolic (p less than 0.005) and 12 mm Hg diastolic (p less than 0.02). Mean nighttime reduction was 8-mm Hg systolic (p less than 0.05) and 6-mm Hg diastolic (difference not significant). There was no postural decrease in BP on 60 degrees head-up tilting and hypotensive action was maintained during isometric exercise (reduction at peak of 32/18 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and throughout dynamic exercise (reduction at peak of 23/14 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Lacidipine is an effective once-daily antihypertensive agent, with good control of stress response.\r"

  ".W": "After successful repair of coarctation of the aorta in childhood, exercise-induced upper body systolic hypertension is well documented. Beta blockade has been shown to reduce the arm/leg gradient in untreated coarctation of the aorta; treatment before coarctation repair has decreased paradoxical hypertension after repair. Ten patients with successful surgical repair of coarctation, defined as a resting arm/leg gradient of less than or equal to 18 mm Hg, were evaluated by treadmill exercise before and after beta blockade with atenolol. Mean age was 5.5 years at repair and 18 at study. At baseline evaluation, systolic blood pressures at termination of exercise ranged from 201 to 270 mm Hg (mean 229 mm Hg). Arm/leg gradients at exercise termination ranged from 30 to 143 mm Hg (mean 84). Follow-up treadmill exercise studies were performed after beta blockade. Upper extremity systolic pressures at exercise termination were normalized in 9 of 10 patients. Maximal systolic blood pressure recorded at exercise termination ranged from 163 to 223 mm Hg (mean 196 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.005). Arm/leg gradient at termination of exercise also decreased significantly to a mean of 51 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). No patient had symptoms on atenolol and exercise endurance times were unchanged. The study results in this small series suggest that cardioselective beta blockade can be used to treat exercise-induced upper body hypertension effectively after surgical repair of coarctation. Because a high incidence of premature cardiovascular disease has been well documented after satisfactory surgical repair, the findings are of importance for this group of postoperative patients.\r"

  ".W": "Lower cardiovascular mortality rates in lighter drinkers (versus abstainers or heavier drinkers) in population studies have been substantially due to lower coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality. Controversy about this U-shaped curve focuses on whether alcohol protects against CAD or, because of other traits, whether abstainers are at increased risk. Inclusion of ex-drinkers among abstainers in some studies has led to speculation that this might be the trait increasing the risk of abstainers. This new prospective study among 123,840 persons with 1,002 cardiovascular (600 CAD) deaths showed that ex-drinkers had higher cardiovascular and CAD mortality risks than lifelong abstainers in unadjusted analyses, but not in analyses adjusted for age, gender, race, body mass index, marital status and education. Use of alcohol was associated with higher risk of mortality from hypertension, hemorrhagic stroke and cardiomyopathy, but with lower risk from CAD, occlusive stroke and nonspecific cardiovascular syndromes. Subsets free of baseline cardiovascular or CAD risk had U-shaped alcohol-CAD curves similar to subsets with baseline risk. Among ex-drinkers, maximal past intake and reasons for quitting (medical versus non-medical) were unrelated to cardiovascular or CAD mortality. These data show that: (1) alcohol has disparate relations to cardiovascular conditions; (2) higher cardiovascular mortality rates among ex-drinkers are due to confounding traits related to past alcohol use; and (3) the U-shaped alcohol-CAD relation is not due to selective abstinence by persons at higher risk. The findings indirectly support a protective effect of lighter drinking against CAD.\r"

Mean heart period variability (+/- standard error of the mean) was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in control subjects (58 +/- 5 ms) than in the patients at any time before or after transplantation. Heart period variability of innervated recipient atria did not change significantly early (1 to 4 weeks) after transplantation (16 +/- 2 to 24 +/- 5 ms; p = 0.11), but increased significantly between weeks 15 and 37 after transplantation (30 +/- 5 ms, p less than 0.002 versus before transplantation). A stepwise regression model (R2 = 0.35; p = 0.01) showed that heart period variability was directly related to time after transplantation and inversely related to systolic arterial pressure after transplantation and degree of rejection. Heart period variability of the denervated donor atria did not change from early to late periods after transplantation, suggesting that vagal reinnervation of the donor heart had not occurred. These data indicate that baseline parasympathetic activity does not increase significantly during the first month after transplantation but increases significantly between months 3 and 6.\r"

Diagnosis by angiography or echocardiography was accepted only if multiple tumors were present or if tuberous sclerosis was also diagnosed. Nine patients (3 diagnosed prenatally and the remaining 6 at age less than 8 months) were identified as having a total of 24 tumors. Measurements in 2 planes demonstrated at least some evidence of regression in 24 patients (100%), with 20 of 24 having complete resolution. One patient required delayed surgery for excision of a subaortic ridge that appeared at the site of a resolved tumor. Our findings suggest that pediatric cardiac rhabdomyoma is most often a benign condition in which spontaneous regression is the rule. Surgery is recommended only for patients with refractory dysrhythmias or severe hemodynamic compromise.\r"

The 24-h EE and its components, sleeping EE (SEE), basal EE (BEE), and daytime EE, for an individual were very reproducible (coefficient of variation 2.3%, 1.4%, 5.0%, & 3.1%, respectively). The variability of 24-h EE among subjects was 11.4% but only 4.1% when adjusted for differences in lean body mass (LBM). LBM was the best determinant of 24-h EE, BEE, and SEE and accounted for 91-93% of the interindividual variance of EE. The prediction equations were 24EE (kcal/d) = 390 + 33.3 LBM (r2 = 0.93, P = 0.000001), SEE (kcal/h) = 9.8 + 1.1 LBM (r2 = 0.92, P = 0.000001), and BEE (kcal/h) = -3.1 + 1.35 LBM (r2 = 0.91, P = 0.000002).

  ".W": "Resting metabolic rate is demonstrated to be a function of fat-free mass and a growth variable related to food-energy-input imbalance rate. By use of obligatory energy expenditure terms, the two-reservoir energy model applied to hyperphagia shows that growth of the fat-free mass is rapid whereas that of the fat store is slow and that the growth of both is bounded. Most of the excess energy at the onset of hyperphagia initially goes into the fat store, but this decreases with time until the greater fraction is diverted to the fat-free mass. The two-reservoir model predicts that weight gain per unit of excess energy is not constant but decreases monotonically until ultimately reaching an asymptotic value. Departure of theory and experiment in the long term suggests that facultative considerations become increasingly important.\r"

The distribution of cumulative weight gain indicates that for adolescents not only is the median gain at term (14.2-15.5 kg) significantly in excess of that reported for adults, but also weight-gain velocity is greater from the beginning of pregnancy. Although the contributions of prepregnancy weight-for-height and weight gain to birth weight may be independent, they are not necessarily additive. Birth weight does not appear improved for the infants of overweight adolescents except when weight gain is low (less than 11.1-12.3 kg at term), and, for Puerto Rican and black adolescents, birth weight is not further improved at any maternal prepregnancy body mass index (weight-for-height) with excessive weight gains (greater than 17.9-19.3 kg at term).\r"

Change to the vegetarian or fish diet had little effect on diet total hormone concentrations; however, the amount of estradiol was significantly decreased in the vegetarian group. When nutrient consumption was correlated with hormone concentrations, prolactin was directly associate with fat consumption, sex-hormone-binding globulin was inversely associated with fat consumption (particularly cholesterol consumption), and the proportion of nonprotein-bound estradiol was directly associated with complex carbohydrate consumption.\r"

The anemic women had lower rectal temperatures than did control women (36.0 +/- 0.2 vs 36.2 +/- 0.1 degree C, respectively, P = 0.001) and a lower rate of oxygen consumption (5.28 +/- 0.26 vs 5.99 +/- 0.29 mL.min-1.kg body wt-1, respectively, P = 0.04) at 100 min of cold exposure. Plasma thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.002) lower in anemic than in control women at baseline and during cold exposure. Responses of iron-depleted subjects were similar to those of control subjects. Iron supplementation corrected the anemia, significantly (P = 0.03) improved rectal temperature at 100 min, and partially normalized plasma thyroid hormone concentrations. Plasma catecholamines were unaffected by iron status.

Urinary acylcarnitine excretion was significantly higher and the ratio of free to total carnitine was significantly lower when infants were fed the formula with medium-chain triglycerides. Two groups of 10 infants were fed a commercial soy-protein-based formula modified to contain 40% of fat calories as medium-chain triglycerides and with or without added L-carnitine. By 56 d, infants fed the formula without added L-carnitine excreted significantly more medium-chain dicarboxylic acids than did the same infants at 28 d and significantly more than infants consuming the carnitine-supplemented formula at either 28 or 56 d. Results are consistent with a role for carnitine in metabolism of dietary medium-chain triglycerides in infants.\r"

Dietary eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA, 20: 5n-3 (omega-3)] was strongly associated with erythrocyte membrane EPA (r = 0.908 at 6 wk), strengthening its value as a measure of compliance in fish and fish-oil feeding trials.

When the fish-based diet was supplemented with fish oil (5 g/d), there was a significant lowering of plasma triacylglycerol (-0.16 +/- 0.24 mmol/L; mean +/- SD).

Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) comprised 8% of total chylomicron triglyceride fatty acids after the first MCT meal. After 6 d of continued MCT feeding, chylomicron triglyceride MCFA content increased to 13%. When subjects were fed the LCT (soybean oil) diet, C16:0, C18:1, and C18:2 comprised nearly 90% of the chylomicron triglyceride fatty acids. The mass of triglyceride transported in chylomicrons isolated from subjects fed the MCT diet was approximately 20% of that found when subjects consumed the LCT diet. We conclude that although total triglyceride production during MCT ingestion is low, the chylomicron triglycerides that are synthesized contain significant amounts of MCFA.\r"

Plasma glucose concentrations did not increase markedly after either meal in any of the subjects. In males, postprandial triglyceridemia was unaffected by fiber supplementation. In females, postprandial triglyceridemia was greater for the high- than for the low-fiber meal at 2, 3, and 4 h. After both meals triglyceridemia was higher in males than in females, which may be related to the lower ratio of high-density lipoprotein2 (HDL)2 to HDL3 in males vs females.

The flavin content of human milk samples in this study was higher than contents reported in earlier studies where no correction for the internal fluorescence quenching of FAD was made. This finding may have implications for dietary recommendations concerning both lactating women and infants. In practical terms, the types and amounts of flavins in human milk are very similar to those recently reported for cow milk.\r"

The decreased specific absorption was compensated by increased mucosal growth in the resected group so that absorption per unit length of segment (per cm) was the same in both groups. Resection increased secretion of calcium and magnesium by 66% per unit weight of mucosa and by 145%/cm in the distal segment. Comparing proximal with distal segments in the resected group, secretion was greater in distal for calcium and in proximal for magnesium.

Significant correlations between mother-daughter pairs for BMD of all lumbar and femoral areas [except for L2 (r = 0.26, P = 0.054)] indicated familial resemblances in bone mineralization. Total calcium intake was significantly correlated with three BMD values for the daughters (L2, femoral neck, and trochanter) but not for the mothers. When mothers were classified as pre- (n = 20) or postmenopausal (n = 17), correlation coefficients for BMD were higher for premenopausal mothers and their daughters and lower for postmenopausal mothers and their daughters, except for the trochanter.

Hereditary influences on bone status were also evaluated by comparing subjects' and parents' bone mass. The main determinant of calcium balance was calcium intake; net calcium absorption increased with intake and urinary calcium did not change. Adolescent females retained 200-500 mg Ca/d, suggesting that inadequate calcium intake may translate into inadequate calcium retention and a reduction in peak bone mass. There was a more pronounced increase in bone mass over time in the calcium-supplemented group (1640 mg Ca/d) than in the control group (750 mg Ca/d), but the differences between bone mass measurements were not statistically significant, possibly because of a type II error.

A positive association between energy-adjusted total fat intake and occurrence of breast cancer was also observed. The relative risk in the highest tertile as compared with the lowest tertile was 1.7 (95% confidence limits 0.6-4.8). The corresponding relative risks were 1.4 (0.5-3.7) for saturated fatty acids, 2.7 (1.0-7.4) for monounsaturated fatty acids, 1.2 (0.6-2.8) for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 2.2 (1.0-5.0) for cholesterol intake.

Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire and donated a fasting blood sample before definitive workup for breast masses. Dietary and plasma concentrations of carotenoids and retinol for 83 women found to have breast cancer were compared with those of 113 women found to be free of breast cancer (control subjects). There were no case-control differences in dietary estimates of vitamin A intake or in plasma alpha-carotene and lycopene. However, subjects with breast cancer had lower concentrations of plasma beta-carotene than did control subjects (P = 0.02). There was no overall association between plasma retinol and breast cancer but a positive relationship was observed between retinol and breast cancer in the subgroup with low beta-carotene values. These results suggest that low plasma beta-carotene is associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Other studies will need to determine whether low carotene concentrations are a subtle effect of the disease or might be causally related to breast cancer.\r"

The relative risk in the highest quintile of vegetable fat intake, as compared with the lowest quintile, was 0.6 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-0.9], and the corresponding relative risk for vegetable protein intake was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.6-0.9).

Recent data indicate that MCTs may be useful as a dietary substitute in a variety of clinical disorders. The current studies were undertaken to characterize urinary organic acid excretion in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus during 4 d of an LCT or MCT diet. Urinary excretion of the dicarboxylic acids adipic, suberic, and 3-hydroxysebacic and the (omega-1) hydroxylation products 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and 7-hydroxyoctanoic acid, was increased during MCT feeding as compared with LCT feeding. Urinary suberic and 7-hydroxyoctanoic acid excretions were increased 55- and 30-fold, respectively, during the MCT-substituted diet. Urinary organic acid profiles provide information on the fate of lipids during MCT feeding and may also be useful in assessing complicance during clinical trials employing MCT-substituted diets.\r"

To test whether nutrition status contributes to the immunologic changes observed in elderly individuals, we examined the relationship between nutrition status and in vitro indices of immune responses in 82 healthy, free-living elderly individuals. Nutrition status was assessed by anthropometric measurements, 7 d food records, and blood concentrations of selected nutrients. Using regression analyses, we found that none of the nutrition factors was associated with cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells against the leukemic cell line K562. However, our results suggest that the dietary intakes of vitamins E and D negatively influenced the activity of interleukin 2 (IL-2) measured by a bioassay in which the CTLL cell line was used. An association may exist between particular aspects of nutrition status and regulation of immune response by IL-2. The need for further studies is emphasized.\r"

Statistical models controlling for infant age, season of the year, and individual showed significant 5-6% decreases in total energy intake during diarrhea or fever. There were no changes with illness in the frequency of breast-feeding, total suckling time, or amount of breast-milk energy consumed. By contrast, energy intake from non-breast-milk sources decreased by 20-30% during diarrhea and fever, and the small decrements in total energy consumption during illness were explained entirely by reduced consumption of non-breast-milk foods.\r"

Eight weeks of active treatment with skim milk from immunized cows reduced serum total cholesterol concentrations by 0.52 +/- 0.59 mmol/L (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.025), or 8%, LDL cholesterol by 0.16 +/- 0.59 mmol/L (NS), or 4%, and the atherogenic index (total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol) by 0.42 +/- 1.85 (P less than 0.05), or 8%, compared with the placebo treatment. Reversal of the favorable development occurred upon cessation of active treatment. We conclude that daily supplementation of a normal diet with skim milk from immunized cows can result in a significant reduction of elevated blood cholesterol concentrations.\r"

Means of plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were substantially lower and the ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol was higher in this Chinese population than in Western populations. Mortality rates for CVD in China were well below Western values. Within China neither plasma total cholesterol nor LDL cholesterol was associated with CVD. A strong inverse correlation between red blood cell oleate concentrations and CVD was observed. However, red blood cell oleate concentrations were not associated with plasma cholesterol but were strongly negatively associated with arachidonate concentrations, suggesting potential diminution of CVD by oleate through reduced platelet aggregability. The results indicate that geographical differences in CVD mortality within China are caused primarily by factors other than dietary or plasma cholesterol.\r"

Thereafter, in a survey of 53 children aged 0.6-4.8 y, single blood samples were drawn 5 h after the dehydroretinyl acetate dose. The DR-R ratio ranged from 0.0028 to 0.169. With a DR-R ratio of 0.03 as the cutoff value, 62% of the children were judged to be of marginal vitamin A status.\r"

Milk vitamin B-12 concentrations were lower in women consuming a strict vegetarian diet compared with an omnivorous diet. Milk vitamin B-12 was inversely related to length of time on a vegetarian diet and positively correlated with maternal serum vitamin B-12 concentrations. Infant urinary MMA excretion was inversely related to milk vitamin B-12 concentrations less than 362 pmol/L. The 1989 recommended dietary allowance for vitamin B-12 of 221 pmol/d for infants is close to the intake below which infant urinary MMA excretion is increased. We conclude that the current RDA for infants provides little margin of safety.\r"

Thiamin status (TPP effect) was not affected by folate status (plasma and erythrocyte folate) during the baseline period or with folic acid supplementation alone. Polyphenol intake was not correlated with thiamin status. Only thiamin intake and thiamin supplementation significantly affected thiamin status. Because the majority of subjects (102 of 160) were initially thiamin deficient, enrichment of Irish grain products with thiamin is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effects of chronic ethanol feeding and acute ethanol exposure in vitro on biotin transport in rat intestine. Transport studies were performed with intestinal everted sacs. Ethanol was fed to rats for 6-7 wk. Compared with pair-fed controls, ethanol feeding significantly decreased plasma biotin concentrations and transport at physiological concentrations (0.01, 0.1, and 0.3 mumol/L) but not at pharmacological concentration (100 mumol/L). When added to the incubation medium of everted jejunal sacs from dry-food-fed rats, ethanol (2% vol:vol) significantly inhibited the transport of biotin at a physiological concentration (0.1 mumol/L) but not at a pharmacological concentration (100 mumol/L). The inhibitory effect of ethanol on the transport of 0.1 mumol biotin/L increased with increasing concentration of ethanol in the incubation medium [0.5% to 5% (vol:vol)]. Acetaldehyde, the major ethanol metabolite, also significantly inhibited biotin transport at 0.2% (vol:vol). These data demonstrate that chronic ethanol feeding and acute ethanol exposure in vitro inhibit the intestinal transport of biotin by the carrier-mediated process. Chronic ethanol feeding is also associated with a significant decrease in plasma biotin concentrations. The ethanol-induced inhibition in intestinal transport of biotin may be a contributing factor in reducing plasma biotin concentrations.\r"

In a less severely iodine-deficient city of the same endemia (Businga), selenium status was moderately altered. RBC-GPX activity was linearly associated with serum selenium concentration up to a value of 1140 nmol/L and leveled off at approximately 15 U/g Hb at greater selenium concentration. At Karawa villages, selenium supplementation normalized both the serum selenium and the RBC-GPX. This combined iodine and selenium deficiency could be associated with the elevated frequency of endemic myxedematous cretinism in Central Africa.\r"

There was evidence of preexisting somatic protein and fat depletion in seven of nine subjects. Patients were allowed to eat freely on a metabolic ward. Nitrogen balances were -0.89 +/- 1.38 g/d (means +/- SEM) before CS therapy, -5.77 +/- 1.30 g/d during therapy (P less than 0.001), and -3.54 +/- 1.38 g/d after therapy (P less than 0.01) despite increased energy and nitrogen intake and clinical resolution of inflammation during and after the pulse therapy.

Despite the habitual high linoleic acid intake of the study population, significant incorporation of n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids into the serum, platelet, and erythrocyte lipids was observed after the fish-oil supplement. Ingestion of fish oil resulted in a 40% decrease in the triglyceride concentration, a 12% increase in HDL cholesterol, and a significant decrease in plasma viscosity, whereas the vegetable-oil placebo had no significant effect. We conclude that a moderate intake of fish oil (15 g/d) is a feasible treatment for hypertriglyceridemia even in patients with a background of high linoleic acid intake and that it may have a beneficial effect on several cardiovascular risk factors.\r"

Errors in self-reported weight were greater in overweight females than in overweight males. Race, age, and end-digit preference were ancillary predictors of reporting error in weight.

An analysis of theoretical cases in which isotope flux is not constant indicates that the multipoint method can cause errors in the calculation of average isotope fluxes, but these are generally small. Simulations of the effect of analytical error indicate that increasing the number of replicates on two points reduces the impact of technical errors more effectively than does performing single analyses on multiple samples. It appears that generally there is no advantage to collecting frequent samples when the 2H2(18)O method is used to estimate energy expenditure in adult humans.\r"

For example, tall patients with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) can exhibit values for FFM and BFM similar to those of shorter well-nourished individuals. To obviate such difficulties, we propose use of height-normalized indices, namely, a FFM index [FFM (kg)/height (m)2, or FFMI] and a BFM index [BFM (kg)/height (m)2, or BFMI]. We calculated these indices in a reference population of 124 healthy young men and in 32 nonobese young men (from the Minnesota Study) before, during, and after experimental semistarvation. When values for FFMI and BFMI falling below the reference cohort's 5th percentile cutoff point were used as a criterion for PEM, these indices, together with basal oxygen-consumption rate, diagnosed PEM in 27 of the 32 Minnesota Study subjects after 12 wk of semi-starvation. These findings indicate that FFMI and BFMI may be useful in nutritional assessment.\r"

Compared with data from 1955, mean heights increased 6.1% among boys and 4.4% among girls whereas mean weights increased 28.8% among boys and 18.7% among girls across all age groups.

However, the regression of delta RMR on delta FFM revealed that the decline in RMR tended to be greater than could be accounted for by loss of FFM. At initial test and retest, body fat (Fat) was not a predictor of RMR after FFM had been taken into account but delta Fat significantly contributed to the prediction of delta RMR when added to the equation after delta FFM. Thus, people losing larger amounts of weight had declines in RMR greater than could be accounted for by loss of FFM. Self-reported age of onset of obesity was not related to delta RMR.\r"

To assess the usefulness of DNA flow cytometry in predicting the metastatic potential of these tumors, the authors studied 44 primary and metastatic follicular neoplasms of the thyroid by DNA flow cytometry of paraffin-embedded tissue. The neoplasms were obtained from 44 men ranging in age from 50 to 79 years (mean, 60). There were 29 follicular adenomas, 11 primary follicular carcinomas (neoplasms with capsular and/or vascular invasion), and 4 metastatic follicular carcinomas. Follow-up information was available on 40 of the 44 patients. The mean follow-up was 114 months. Twenty-five of the 29 follicular adenomas had a diploid DNA content, 2 (7%) were tetraploid, and the DNA histograms on 2 were not interpretable. All patients with follicular adenomas had no evidence of disease (NED) at last follow-up. Eight of the 11 primary follicular carcinomas were diploid. Six of these patients had NED, one died with carcinoma at 82 months, and no follow-up was available on one. Three (27%) of the primary follicular carcinomas were aneuploid or tetraploid. Two of these patients had NED, and the third died with carcinoma 84 months after diagnosis. Two of the four metastatic follicular carcinomas were diploid and two (50%) were aneuploid or tetraploid. One of the two patients with diploid metastatic follicular carcinomas died with carcinoma, as did one of the two patients with aneuploid metastatic follicular carcinomas. These results suggest the following: (1) follicular carcinomas are more likely to be aneuploid or tetraploid than are follicular adenomas; (2) follicular neoplasms without capsular or vascular invasion may include a small number of aneuploid or tetraploid tumors; and (3) DNA ploidy does not add to the prognostic value of histologic studies alone.\r"

  ".W": "The estrogen receptor (ER) expression of invasive breast cancer has been extensively studied both biochemically and with specific monoclonal antibodies against ER. Relatively few studies have attempted to characterize ER pattern in breast carcinoma in situ (CIS) and in other premalignant lesions. In the current study, the authors investigated the pattern of ER expression in 62 cases of breast CIS, 30 of which had a component of invasive cancer, and 36 cases of atypical hyperplasia. Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed breast tissue underwent enzyme pretreatment to expose nuclear antigenic sites as previously described. Breast tissues then underwent estrogen immunocytochemical assay using specific monoclonal antibodies (Abbott Laboratory, Chicago, IL). The cases were evaluated for heterogeneity, intensity of staining, and percentage of ER-positive cells. An attempt was made to study the relation between the pattern of ER expression, nuclear pleomorphism, and type of CIS. The results of ER immunocytochemical assay showed positive nuclear staining for ER in 75% of the CIS, 73% of CIS with invasive cancer, and 100% of atypical hyperplasias. ER expression in CIS agreed with that in the invasive carcinoma in 29 of 30 cases. This study also suggests that comedocarcinoma has a higher incidence of negative ER expression than the other types of CIS, particularly when it is associated with significant nuclear pleomorphism. There was no significant difference in ER tumor heterogeneity between premalignant and malignant lesions.\r"

Various proportions of plasma cells, histiocytes, and spindle cells were observed; the latter corresponded ultrastructurally to fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, were immunoreactive for vimentin and actin and focally for desmin, and were negative for epithelial markers. Plasma cells were polyclonal for light chains. One patient had two recurrences, and in one case a large pleural IMT was found eight years after the excision of a similar lesion in the lung. All patients with follow-up (ten) were well as long as ten years after the diagnosis (average, 3.7 years).\r"

Samples from 154 patients were concurrently analyzed by a commercial filter hybridization technique (Virapap and Viratype Kits, Life Technologies, Bethesda Research Labs, Gaithersburg, MD). The sensitivity of the Southern blot procedure combined with PCR was significantly higher than that of the Virapap and Viratype methods. HPV was detected in 67% of women who had positive results for dysplasia by PCR and in 47% by the Virapap method. HPV types 16/18 were found more commonly than types 6/11 in every diagnostic category. More than one HPV type was detected in 12% of HPV-positive patients. The prevalence of HPV in cytologically negative or indefinite patients as measured by PCR was 22% and 40%; in contrast, by the Virapap method, these values were 7% and 10%. These results demonstrate that PCR combined with Southern hybridization provides a higher level of sensitivity than methods that use hybridization without amplification of HPV DNA and also show that the prevalence of HPV is highest in cytologically positive smears.\r"

In comparison with Southern transfer hybridization, performed with the same probes used in the dot filter kit, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of dot filter hybridization were 90%, 94%, 74%, and 98%, respectively. Among patients with cervical cytologic dysplasia, HPV DNA was detected in 44% by dot filter hybridization and in 35% by Southern transfer hybridization. Although 26% of specimens positive by dot filter hybridization were not confirmed by Southern transfer hybridization, cervical dysplasia was detected in 5 (25%) of 20 with HPV DNA detected by dot filter hybridization alone, compared with 25 (8%) of those with no definitive evidence of HPV by either method (P = 0.009) and with 16 (30%) of 53 with HPV DNA detected by both methods (P = 0.7). The kappa statistic for interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility for interpretation of blots was similar for the two methods. The dot filter hybridization method evaluated appears to be a satisfactory alternative to Southern transfer hybridization for detection of HPV DNA.\r"

HPV DNA was found in 73 of 172 (42%) anogenital lesions and 17 of 116 (15%) nonanogenital carcinomas. No HPV DNA was found in normal mouse skin (five samples), human autopsy liver (two samples), or kidney (eight samples), or in carcinomas of the breast (three samples), bladder (five samples), or colon (nine samples). Of the nongenital tumors, HPV DNA was found in the carcinomas of the lung (2 of 5), anus (7 of 18), esophagus (9 of 39), buccal cavity (1 of 5), and larynx (5 of 50). HPV DNA was also detected in 2 of 11 histologically normal specimens of the cervix and 1 of 3 human skin lesions. The detection of HPV DNA in carcinomas of the lung, larynx, and esophagus as well as in the anogenital region confirms recent suggestions that HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 have a wider association with different types of cancer than previously believed. The study also shows that HISTOFISH is a useful method for detecting HPV-DNA in histologic specimens.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that proliferative activity (S-phase fraction [SPF]) may have greater prognostic significance than total nuclear DNA content; however, relatively few studies have examined SPF from paraffin-embedded tissue because of significant contamination of histograms with debris. In this study, cell cycle analysis was performed on 124 matched tissue specimens. Fresh tissue was divided into two equal portions; one portion was frozen, whereas the other portion was processed and embedded in paraffin. S-phase could be determined for both frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue in 81 cases. Correlation between SPF from frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue was demonstrated (r = 0.80) when debris was subtracted from histograms with the use of two new subtraction algorithms referred to as multicut and singlecut. Unlike other debris-subtraction algorithms, the quantity and distribution of debris calculated by these algorithms are dependent on the magnitude and position of histogram peaks. A lesser degree of correlation was demonstrated with the use of a standard exponential debris subtraction algorithm (r = 0.67). Correlation of SPF for aneuploid cases was greater when SPF was calculated as a percentage of the aneuploid cell population rather than as a percentage of the entire cell population. This was attributed to the observation that the proportion of aneuploid cells from paraffin-embedded tissue was less than that from frozen tissue. The results of this study indicate that SPF can be calculated from paraffin-embedded tissue with values comparable to those obtained from frozen tissue. The ability to calculate SPF reliably from paraffin-embedded tissue should allow additional evaluation of this parameter as a prognostic indicator.\r"

LIP appeared as black globules in the sinusoids. Ninety-four tissue blocks from 13 postangiographic LIP HCCs and 69 from 8 non-LIP HCCs and 4 fatty livers were studied. Seventy-two of 73 negative controls and all positive blocks as seen on soft tissue radiographs (STRs) were correctly coded (specificity 98.6%, sensitivity 100%). Twenty-six of the 44 LIP-negative areas on STRs from LIP cases contained scanty globules of less than 10 microns in diameter. Fatty change gave no positive readings. Thus, modified AgNO3 impregnation is a simple, accurate means of detecting LIP in high-quality paraffin sections suitable for tumor diagnosis and, if applied to postangiographic LIP, ultrasonographically guided liver biopsy, can verify that a biopsy has reached a suspected tumor focus.\r"

To investigate this issue with regard to adult ALL, the authors reviewed the immunophenotyping data from 39 cases analyzed in their clinical laboratory. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow was performed with the use of a panel of 21 B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The surface antigen profiles of the leukemic cells were compared with those of normal bone marrow and thymic counterparts, as defined by current models. Twenty-six cases were B-precursor ALL, 8 were T-ALL, and 3 were B-ALL (Burkitt's leukemia). Only two cases coexpressed lymphoid and myeloid antigens. In contrast, intralineage aberrancy was quite common. Immunophenotypes from 13 of 26 B-precursor ALL cases deviated from normal B-lineage marrow cells as defined by a recent classification. The T-ALL cases were also immunophenotypically heterogeneous. This high incidence of aberrant antigen expression in adult ALL suggests that leukemogenesis also involves aberrant differentiation rather than purely a process of maturational arrest.\r"

The mean DNA index of the aneuploid tumors was 1.58 +/- 0.71. The frequency of DNA aneuploidy was only slightly higher (23%) in intermediate than in low-grade lymphomas (17%). None of the five high-grade lymphomas showed DNA aneuploidy. The chromosome study was successful in 81% of cases (39 of 48), and clonal chromosome abnormalities were observed in 92% of these (36 of 39). In most of the chromosomally abnormal clones the chromosome number was in the diploid range. Most tumors with pseudodiploid (46 chromosomes), hypodiploid (45-44 chromosomes), or hyperdiploid (47-49 chromosomes) clones were DNA diploid by flow cytometry. On the other hand, all specimens with a chromosome number exceeding 50 were DNA aneuploid by flow cytometry. Therefore, flow cytometric DNA analysis appears to be a rather coarse method that will detect aneuploidy only when there is a major increase in chromosome material.\r"

Eighteen of them were from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (18 of 250), 2 from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (2 of 115), and 8 from patients with mixed connective tissue disease (8 of 10). Antigenic material for this antibody is resistant to DNase, partially sensitive to RNase, and sensitive to trypsin. This indicates that the antigen is composed of protein and possibly RNA. In immunoblot analysis, sera positive for this antibody in indirect immunofluorescence assay recognized different peptides. This suggests that protein peptides are the major antigenic material.\r"

  ".U": "91051397\r", 
  ".W": "The administration of radioisotopes for diagnostic nuclear medicine scans and therapeutic procedures is quite prevalent today. A period of interference with the counting of a radioimmunoassay [RIA] test may occur with the serum of a patient receiving an in vivo radionuclide that decays by gamma emission. Because the logistics of precounting all specimens may be cumbersome and prohibitive, it is important to determine the degree of this interference. In this study, the authors evaluate the potential interference of the most commonly used radioisotopes with RIA studies. For two months (March and August 1988) 10,650 patient serum specimens were counted for significant background gamma radiation before RIA testing. Forty-three patients, on whom 105 RIA tests were performed, were identified as having preassay gamma radiation in their serum. With the use of selective energy windows for each different interfering radionuclide, proportional determinations were made as to the amount of interfering gamma radiation spilling into the iodine 125 test marker window. It was shown that initial whole serum pretest gamma counts as high as 111,000 counts/minute did not significantly affect the results of the RIA. Because of the meticulous washing and decanting procedures required in modern RIA and the monoclonal nature of most antibodies used currently, it appears the degree of nonspecific binding of this potentially interfering radiation is minuscule. The energy level of cobalt 57, however, and many of the other commonly used radioisotopes, overlaps so closely that it is difficult to window for this interference. It is possible, therefore, that this distinction cannot be made and folate and vitamin B12 test systems using cobalt 57 markers may have to be routinely prescreened. The authors conclude that the requirement for prescreening of all RIA test samples for interfering gamma radiation is unnecessary (1987 CAP Commission on Laboratory Accreditation Inspection Checklist, Section VII, Question 07.0290).\r"

The authors' results indicate that metastasis can be more accurately estimated on the basis of invasion depth, histopathologic grading, and especially tumor thickness. One essential advantage of these criteria is that they can be established by a histopathologist. It is interesting to note that in the authors' collective no carcinoma less than 2 mm thick metastasized, that is, a relatively high percentage of carcinomas (48%) can be graded as no-risk carcinomas. The risk of metastasis for undifferentiated carcinomas greater than 6 mm thick that have infiltrated the musculature, the perichondrium, or the periosteum, however, is quite high. Tumors between 2 and 6 mm thick with moderate differentiation and a depth of invasion that does not extend beyond the subcutis can be classified as low-risk carcinomas.\r"

This study shows that besides the Langerhans' cells, the indeterminate cells of the skin and the interdigitating dendritic reticulum cells of the lymph node may also be involved in this process. Moreover, some multinucleate giant cells and foamy cells may be derived from Langerhans' and related cells.\r"

Despite this, recurrence of the tumor resulted in the girl's death within three months. The neoplasm showed typical light microscopic features of malignant rhabdoid tumor as well as filamentous cytoplasmic inclusions by electron microscopic examination and staining for both cytokeratin and vimentin by immunohistochemistry. The classic clinicopathologic features of this tumor support the concept that malignant rhabdoid tumors similar to those of the kidney may occur in extrarenal sites.\r"

At bronchoscopic examination, a polypoid mass was found to occlude the left mainstem bronchus. Biopsies showed a malignant epithelioid tumor resembling an atypical carcinoid. Histochemistry, electron microscopic study, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma. Physical examination and additional clinical history to exclude other possible primary sites were negative. The patient underwent thoracotomy with left pneumonectomy. Nineteen months after resection she was found to have a histologically similar tumor involving her left adrenal gland. Review of the literature shows that melanoma of the lower respiratory tract has been reported only in adults and has a tendency to present as a central polypoid growth that may be responsive to surgical resection.\r"

We analyzed data from the Child Health Supplement to the 1981 National health Interview Survey, a population-based survey with information concerning 15,416 children, to address the following questions: are there racial or socioeconomic differences in rates of childhood asthma; if yes, what is the contribution of social and environmental characteristics to the observed differences? In this sample, black children were more likely to have asthma than were white children (4.4% vs. 2.5%). Racial disparities in prevalence emerged early and at all childhood ages were due to higher black rates of onset between the ages of 1 and 3 years. Poverty status, maternal cigarette smoking, large family size, smaller size of home, low birth weight, and maternal age younger than 20 years at the child's birth were all associated with increased rates of childhood asthma. When available social and environmental characteristics were controlled for using multivariate analyses, the increased risk for asthma among black and poor children was reduced to statistical insignificance. We conclude that black and poor children in the United States do have higher rates of asthma, that social and environmental factors exert substantial influences on rates of asthma, and that much of the racial and economic disparity in prevalence can be accounted for by a variety of social and environmental characteristics.\r"

Patients with H influenzae bacteremia were more likely to have soft-tissue foci, poorer clinical appearance at presentation, and be at higher risk for subsequent serious focal infections, persistent bacteremia, and subsequent hospital admissions than patients with S pneumoniae. Patients with H influenzae bacteremia had a 21.1-fold increase in risk of meningitis (95% confidence interval [CI] of 3.8 to 78.0) compared with those with S pneumoniae. The odds ratio for initial lumbar puncture was 5.25 (95% CI [1.1-23.6]). Ambulatory patients treated with antibiotics at presentation were less likely to develop new serious soft-tissue infections, persistent bacteremia, or to require subsequent hospital admissions than untreated patients. The effect of treatment was greater for patients with S pneumoniae than those with H influenzae. Careful follow-up and reevaluation of patients with presumptive bacteremia is essential because treated and untreated patients can still develop serious soft-tissue infections.\r"

A literature search revealed no evidence in the form of data from patients, so a chart review of all complete blood cell counts ordered during a 1-year period by one group of pediatricians was undertaken. At least one value outside of published normal ranges was found on 74.7% of the tests performed on clinically well children.

Enriched CIC in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children contained low levels of complement.

In the United States, at least 121 children have died in a similar manner in the 15 years between 1973 and 1988 according to a report by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. Although the highest mortality occurred among infants, 30 (25%) of the 121 deaths occurred in children 6 years of age or older. Balloons account for 43% of the approximately 15 childhood deaths related to children's products that are documented each year by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Toy rubber balloons are thus the leading cause of pediatric choking deaths from children's products. Preventive efforts should be directed toward a ban on this type of balloon and the development of safer alternatives. Meanwhile, public information campaigns should alert parents, physicians, and policymakers to the dangers of toy rubber balloons.\r"

Echocardiograms were performed in the first 48 hours of life. In 5 patients, disproportionate septal hypertrophy was demonstrated; 1 additional patient had biventricular hypertrophy with a thickened septum but not disproportionate septal hypertrophy. The mean septal: left ventricular free-wall ratio for the group (n = 10) was 1.37. No correlation was apparent between the occurrence of disproportionate septal hypertrophy and newborn glucose, bilirubin, or hematocrit values. When analyzed separately, the 4 patients who did not receive intrauterine blood transfusions had a ratio of 1.73 +/- 0.21 (mean +/- SEM); this was significantly greater than the ratio in the 6 patients who were transfused in utero (1.13 +/- 0.24). In patients who underwent transfusions, there was no correlation between the number of transfusions and the septal:left ventricular ratio. This study reports a significant but previously unrecognized cardiac hypertrophy with disproportionate septal hypertrophy in patients with erythroblastosis fetalis. Our data suggest a sparing effect of intrauterine fetal transfusions. The mechanism by which these transfusions may affect the hypertrophic development of the myocardium remains to be determined.\r"

The red blood cell distribution width was less than 17.0 in those with thalassemia trait and greater than 17.0 in the iron-deficient subjects. Results of our study suggest that microcytosis in children with lead poisoning is due to coexistent iron deficiency or thalassemia trait.

We explored pediatricians' knowledge and practices regarding parental use of alcohol and compared these attributes with those of family practitioners. Child health care providers attending three continuing medical education courses in general pediatrics were surveyed using a closed-item questionnaire. One hundred ninety (69%) of the participants responded, including 90 pediatricians and 39 family practitioners. Forty-six percent of responding pediatricians, compared with 90% of family practitioners, stated that they ask about problems with alcohol in taking a routine family history. Thirty-eight percent of pediatricians who knew the frequency of alcoholism, compared with 47% of those who did not, indicated that they include it in taking a routine family history. Forty-six percent of pediatricians who have experienced a problem with alcohol in their own family, compared with 20% of pediatricians without such personal experience, routinely address the issue of alcohol use with parents and children. Similar analyses among the family practitioners revealed no significant differences. We conclude that fewer than half of pediatricians ask about problems with alcohol in taking a family history. The likelihood of asking about such problems was not influenced by the health care provider's knowledge of alcoholism, but it was influenced by the provider's personal family history of problems with alcohol. Because of the important morbidity associated with alcohol use in families, and because intervention can improve functioning and adaptation of the child, training and Continuing Medical Education courses should address this issue.\r"

Analysis of scores from the impact on Family Scale showed no differences in the perceived family impact between primary caretakers and their spouses. Primary caretakers in the sample, however, showed significantly reduced Coping subscale scores with a longer duration of home ventilatory care. This finding, if confirmed in future studies, has policy implications for physicians and other health professionals working with ventilator-dependent children and their families, especially those who care for children over long periods.\r"

All neonates were screened for periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage at 5 to 10 days of age. Eleven incurred a mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 1) and 27 had no periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 2). Each of the infants was neurodevelopmentally normal at 1 to 2 years of age. The 38 children were matched by race, age, sex, and socioeconomic status with control children (group 3) who had been born at term. On outcome measurements at 5 to 6 years of age, groups 1 and 2 scored significantly lower than group 3 on the combined test measurements and on three of the four individual measurements. Group 1 scored significantly lower than group 2 on the combined test measurements only. These data indicate that very-low-birth-weight infants are at risk for learning problems. Although children with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage did not demonstrate a significant deficit on individual test scores, the significant difference on the combined battery suggests that mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage has an adverse effect on global performance.\r"

Mean catheter stay was 13 days (range, less than 1 to 77 days). Almost half (49%) of the central and thoracic catheters (91% of placements) were removed nonelectively: 43% due to problems such as leaking or clotting and 6% to suspicion of sepsis or venous occlusion. Of the 23 episodes of possible sepsis in the 478 catheter stays, six (1.3%) were confirmed catheter-related sepsis; 12 (2.5%) were confirmed alternate locus sepsis. Three factors specific to percutaneous central venous catheter-related sepsis were prolonged catheter stay (3 to 5 weeks), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and weight less than or equal to 1 kg. Four factors specific to alternate locus sepsis were presence of an alternate infection site, earlier infection (1 to 2 weeks), extremely low birth weight, and prolonged clinical instability. Percutaneous central venous catheterizations reduced the need for the stress of repeated venipuncture, resulting in lower complication rates than those reported with surgically placed central venous catheters, and leading to identification of risk factors specific to catheter sepsis and alternate locus sepsis.\r"

Several features known to be typical of Prader-Willi syndrome in early infancy were confirmed, including hypotonia and genital hypoplasia. A number of features that have not previously been emphasized as characterizing Prader-Willi syndrome were also identified, most notably abnormal cry and, in males, signs of genital hypoplasia but with an apparently normal phallus. Other features included disproportionately large head circumference, disproportionately large anterior fontanelle, mild micrognathia, mild anomalies of the gingivae or alveolar ridges, and changes in the appearance of the skin. Appreciation of these features may assist the pediatrician in recognizing the child with Prader-Willi syndrome during the neonatal period, before the appearance of better-known findings of later onset, such as obesity and acromicria.\r"

We examined the longitudinal influences of several behavioral and social variables on the smoking status of 443 students followed from early to late adolescence. Of the factors examined, association with friends who smoke and previous smoking status were consistently associated with an adolescent's future smoking status. Other factors, such as attachment to father or to mother, parental supervision, extracurricular activity, perceived negative and positive effects of smoking, and academic involvement, were all related to late adolescent smoking status. These observations suggest that strategies that influence smoking behavior need to be directed not only to the individual child but also to influences within the child's home and school environment.\r"

To investigate the effect of omeprazole and higher-than-presently-recommended doses of H2-blockers, we evaluated gastric acidity and gastroesophageal reflux in 17 patients with severe-moderate esophagitis before and after treatment with 300 mg ranitidine twice daily or 20 mg omeprazole once daily. Three pH-metric studies were performed, in a cross-over design, before and after 8 days of treatment with omeprazole or ranitidine. Both drugs significantly reduced intragastric acidity (p less than 0.001) during both night and day hours. Median hourly 24-h intragastric pH was 1.8 in the basal study, 2.9 after ranitidine, and 3.4 after omeprazole. Intragastric acidity fell from 84.0 mmol/L in the basal study to 14.2 mmol/L (79% inhibition) with ranitidine and 9.3 mmol/L (84% inhibition) with omeprazole. Patients with esophagitis were significantly more exposed to acid than healthy subjects, in both the supine and upright position (p less than 0.01). The time with esophageal pH less than 4 dropped from 23.9% in the basal study to 8.5% with ranitidine and to 7.2% with omeprazole (p less than 0.001). Both drugs significantly reduced esophageal exposure to acid in both the supine and upright positions (p less than 0.001), whereas neither had any effect on esophageal acid clearance.\r"

In order to replace esophageal manometry for this purpose, we tested whether the esophagogastric junction can be identified correctly by fluoroscopy or the determination of the pH-step between stomach and esophagus, compared with esophageal manometry. The distance from the nares to the esophagogastric junction was determined three times with each of the three methods in 46 patients and 14 volunteers. Fluoroscopy assumed the esophagogastric junction 1.23 +/- 0.23 cm (mean +/- SE) lower than the peak pressure point determined at manometry, pH-step only 0.45 +/- 0.16 cm. With pH-step, only one subject had a difference of more than 3 cm to the manometrically defined esophagogastric junction, whether gastroesophageal reflux disease (as proven by pH monitoring) was present or not. We conclude that the esophagogastric junction can usually be identified with sufficient accuracy by the measurement of the pH-step between stomach and esophagus. Fluoroscopy is far less accurate than pH-step, and should not be used.\r"

Most of the patients, including three radically operated cases of early gastric cancer, died from liver metastasis within 2 yr. The 1-, 3-, and 6-yr survival rates were 37.5%, 8.3%, and 8.3%, respectively, for all cases and 75.0%, 25.0%, and 25.0% for radically operated cases. The incidences of synchronous and metachronous liver metastasis were 31.8% and 40.9%, significantly higher than the incidences of AFP-negative gastric cancer (p less than 0.91). Despite radical gastrectomy, metachronous liver metastasis occurred in 75.0% of the cases. Two radical hepatic resections, including extended right lobectomy, were performed in one patient with early gastric cancer who had repeated metachronous liver metastasis. However, the tumor recurred immediately. Apparently, radical gastrectomy or hepatic resection alone may not suffice for this particular type of cancer. The methods of treatment and follow-up considered should be different from that for other types of gastric cancer.\r"

Serum PG I levels were not influenced by cigarette smoking in either patients with duodenal ulcer or normal subjects. The recurrence rate of duodenal ulcer not under maintenance therapy was significantly higher in hyperPG I patients than in normoPG I patients, regardless of their smoking habits. Only in hyperPG I patients was the recurrence rate in smokers higher than in nonsmokers. Patients under maintenance therapy showed similar results. Multilogistic regression indicated that hyperPG I had a greater effect than cigarette smoking on ulcer recurrence. These findings indicate that serum PG I levels are not influenced by smoking, and the important characteristic in patients with recurrent duodenal ulcers is the increased serum PG I levels.\r"

  ".W": "The authors conducted a prospective, randomized trial of chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acid versus ursodeoxycholic acid alone in patients with cholelithiasis to determine their efficacy for dissolution of gallstones. One hundred and twenty patients with radiolucent gallstones, less than or equal to 15 mm and who had a functioning gallbladder were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups based on the diameter of their largest stones. Seventy patients had stones larger than 5 mm but less than 15 mm, whereas 50 patients had stones that measured 5 mm or less. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid plus ursodeoxycholic acid (5 mm/kg of each) or ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mm/kg) alone. Oral cholecystography, plain abdominal x-rays, and ultrasonography of the gallbladder were done at 6, 12, and 24 months. Dissolution was deemed to be complete if not stones were visualized on two examinations. partial dissolution was defined as a 50% reduction in stone size and/or number. Stones that were not detected by cholecystography but still detected during ultrasonography were considered to be partially dissolved. Plasma triglycerides, serum cholesterol, HDL, and serologic liver function tests were determined at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. In a select group of patients, bile-rich duodenal aspirates were aspirated and analyzed for biliary lipid contents. In the group with small stones, defined as less than or equal to 5 mm, complete stone dissolution occurred significantly more often utilizing combination therapy at 6 months (52% vs 24%), and this trend persisted, although no longer significant, at 12 and 24 months. Combination therapy also achieved an improved rate of dissolution for large stones within 6 months; however, this did not persist at 12 and 24 months. Although not statistically significant, stone calcification occurred less often with combined therapy. All treatment regimens were well tolerated, with only minor changes in bowel habits and mild elevations in serum transaminase levels. Serum lipid levels did not change with either therapy. The authors concluded that the combination of chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid was the preferred therapy for gallstone dissolution, because it dissolves stones more rapidly, with a lower incidence of stone calcifications, and thus might reduce the long-term cost of treatment.\r"

The patients were then randomized to palliative therapy with either endoscopic endoprosthesis or bypass surgery. Prospective indices of survival time, complication rates, hospitalization requirements, and quality of life were followed. All 25 patients randomized to endoprosthesis were treated by this procedure, whereas only 19 of 25 patients randomized to bypass surgery underwent operative biliary-digestive anastomosis. No difference in the above indices were found between the two groups. The authors concluded that palliation of obstructive jaundice due to a malignant bile duct stricture with endoscopically placed biliary stent is as effective as operative bypass.\r"

The clinical phenotype can result from at least two different gene defects. One gene that can cause ADPKD has been located on the short arm of chromosome 16. This discovery has made possible new methods for diagnosing the disorder in gene carriers prior to the development of renal cysts. Although renal cysts are clearly an important manifestation of the gene defect, other systemic manifestations are both common and clinically important. Cardiac valvular lesions, intracranial aneurysms, hepatic cysts, and diverticula are included in the array of systemic manifestations. Moreover, renal cysts are only one of a myriad of renal manifestations. Although ADPKD was long considered an adult cystic disease, it is also a common cause of childhood cystic disease and must be considered in the differential diagnosis in that setting.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-two and 34 consecutive HLA-identical sibling renal transplant recipients were treated with azathioprine/prednisone (AZA; follow-up, 5.0 years) and cyclosporine/prednisone (CSA; mean follow-up, 2.9 years), respectively. Both groups were similar in age, sex, race, and number of transplants, but there were more diabetics in the CSA group (34% v 8%). Actual patient survival at 1 year and actuarial patient survival at 5 years were 100% and 96%, respectively in the CSA group compared with an actual patient survival of 91% and 82% at 1 and 5 years, respectively, in the AZA group. Actual graft survival at 1 year improved from 85% in the AZA group to 97% in the CSA-treated recipients (P less than 0.05). Mean serum creatinine at 5 years remained stable in the AZA group at a mean of 123 mumol/L (1.4 mg/dL) compared with a progressive increase in this parameter to a mean of 212 mumol/L (2.4 mg/dL) after the same time interval in the CSA patients. Furthermore, the slopes of the serum creatinine against time were significantly different between the two groups (P less than 0.01). Mean daily CSA dose averaged 4 mg/kg 12 months following transplantation, with a decrease to 2.4 mg/kg by the fifth year. Causes of death in the AZA group were cardiovascular (eight), sepsis (three), cancer (one); and in the CSA group, Kaposi's sarcoma (one). Causes of graft failure in the AZA group were immunological (six), sepsis (three), technical (two), recurrence of disease (one), and patient death with a functioning graft (five). Technical (one), noncompliance (two), recurrence of disease (one), and patient death with a functioning kidney (one) caused graft failure in the CSA group. No difference in posttransplantation serum cholesterol or incidence of new onset diabetes was observed between the two groups, but hypertension was significantly more frequent (51% v 21%, P less than 0.01) when CSA was used. In conclusion, intermediate-term results of CSA-treated HLA-identical transplant recipients showed improved patient and graft survival with less complications apart from hypertension. However, the slow, but relentless, increase in serum creatinine in the CSA-treated patients compared with those treated with AZA is of concern.\r"

At the end of a treatment course, plasma IgG levels were reduced by 90% +/- 8% of control values (P less than 0.01). In contrast, albumin levels were reduced by only 15% (P less than 0.05). Specific cytotoxic anti-HLA antibody titers were reduced by approximately 18-fold. Panel reactivity was measured as the proportion of a 40-member cell donor panel killed by patients' serum in the presence of complement; in nine of the 14 patients, there was a significant reduction in this parameter (range, 23% to 87%). During the 4-week follow-up period, anti-HLA antibody titers returned to baseline levels. There were no remarkable changes observed in blood chemistries, nor were there any unanticipated adverse reactions seen in the patients treated. We conclude that selective extracorporeal immunoadsorption is a safe and effective way of removing IgG-type antibodies, with potential application to reduction of HLA antibodies in transplant candidates.\r"

Since fluid volume is a determinant of BP in dialysis patients, changes in body fluid spaces during r-HuEPO therapy could affect BP. Thus, 51Cr-labeled red blood cell (RBC) volume, inulin extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, and urea total body water (TBW), as well as cardiac output, plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone concentration were determined postdialysis before and after r-HuEPO therapy in patients in whom changes in BP could be managed by ultrafiltration alone. Eleven patients entered the study: one had a renal transplant and two required addition of antihypertensive drug therapy and were excluded; eight, of whom two required antihypertensive drug therapy following the study, were included in the analyses. Results revealed an increase in predialysis hemoglobin from 67 to 113 g/L (6.7 to 11.3 g/dL) (P = 0.001) during 18 +/- 6 weeks of therapy.

The response to r-HuEPO is impaired if absolute or relative iron deficiency exists. Aluminum may cause a microcytic anemia in patients with ESRD, but the mechanism remains incompletely defined. Twenty-two patients in the Canadian Multicentre EPO trial were studied for 6 months. In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) was used as an indicator of iron-deficient deficient erythropoiesis. The relationship of FEP to the estimates of iron availability (serum iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin) and iron utilization (corrected reticulocyte count, hemoglobin) was evaluated by multiple linear regression analysis. The effect of aluminum on FEP was evaluated by adjusting the statistical model for this variable. All patients were iron replete as assessed by serum ferritin. FEP was not related to serum aluminum before administration of r-HuEPO, but it was significantly correlated with aluminum in the treated group. In hemodialysis patients treated with r-HuEPO, the proportion of the variability explained by the parameters of iron utilization and iron availability was 0.27. The effect of aluminum increased this to 0.59. In hemodialysis patients not receiving r-HuEPO, the proportion of variability in FEP explained by the model increased from 0.16 to 0.28 by adjusting for aluminum. The data support the hypothesis that aluminum interferes with the bioavailability of stored iron for erythropoiesis and thus may result in a microcytic anemia in patients with ESRD or may blunt their response to r-HuEPO therapy.\r"

Three renal cell carcinomas were detected among 96 hemodialysis patients in 1979, and screening by computed tomographic (CT) scan was continued yearly until 1989. During this 10-year period, one renal cell carcinoma was found in the second year and another in the ninth year. Autopsy performed on seven of 19 patients who died showed one case of small clear cell carcinoma accompanying acquired cystic disease. In 33 males, kidneys were found to have enlarged 2.7 +/- 1.7 times over the 10-year follow-up due to acquired cysts, while no change in kidney volume was noted in 24 females. Native kidneys in nine of 12 patients who maintained functioning grafts were reduced in size. The patient with the largest kidney enlargement (11.5 times) died from retroperitoneal bleeding in 1989. These prospective study results suggest that both the incidence and prevalence of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients is high. Furthermore, major complications of acquired renal cystic disease seem to occur predominantly in males.\r"

In addition to experiencing hypercalcemic episodes with peak calcium values of 2.7 to 3.8 mmol/L (10.7 to 15.0 mg/dL), patients in the hypercalcemic group exhibited a significant increase in the mean calcium concentration obtained during 6 months before the switch, compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch (2.4 +/- 0.03 to 2.5 +/- 0.03 mmol/L [9.7 +/- 0.2 to 10.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dL], P = 0.006).

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis was made of 16 patients who had received a brachial-jugular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft for hemodialysis. In four patients, the procedure was used to treat malfunctioning brachio-axillary fistulas due to long venous stenosis in the axillary vein. In 12 other patients, the operation was chosen in cases of exhaustion of the veins in the upper extremity because of previous multiple failed fistulas. Two patients died with a functioning fistula 7 and 10 months after placement of the graft of causes unrelated to the vascular access. The other 14 patients retained functioning fistulas between 8 and 26 months after construction of the shunt. Three patients needed graft thrombectomy to treat occlusive episodes. No venous stenosis was found in a postoperative fistulography made in those patients. One patient needed substitution of a graft segment due to stenosis of the prosthesis crossing over the clavicle. We believe that the brachial-jugular graft is a procedure that can be considered as vascular access for hemodialysis in cases where the use of veins in the upper extremity and the axilla is not possible.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed our 115-month experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) in adult and pediatric patients to determine whether there is a difference in the incidence of peritonitis between patients performing CAPD or CCPD. Peritonitis rates were similar in patients performing CAPD or CCPD in both the adult and pediatric age groups. The overall CAPD peritonitis rate was significantly lower in adult patients when compared with pediatric patients. There was no difference in peritonitis rates for CCPD between adult and pediatric patients. When the data are divided into 3-year subgroups, the incidence of peritonitis is significantly lower in adult patients undergoing either CAPD or CCPD when compared with pediatric patients during the years 1986 to 1988. There is significant improvement over time in the incidence of peritonitis in both adult and pediatric patients performing CCPD; similarly, there is a trend toward improvement in patients performing CAPD. Staphylococcus species organisms remain the most common bacterial cause of peritonitis, except in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years or with nephrostomies, where gram-negative rod infections were more common. Peritonitis resulted in discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis in a greater number of adult patients. These results suggest that the number of catheter manipulations is not important in determining the incidence of peritonitis. Pediatric patients are more likely than adult patients to develop peritonitis with either CAPD or CCPD. Adult patients are more likely than pediatric patients to discontinue peritoneal dialysis secondary to peritonitis.\r"

Because some studies in animals have suggested that potassium depletion enhances renal PGE2 production, the present study examined whether the renal concentrating defect of potassium depletion in humans is mediated by PGE2. Five normal volunteers were studied before and after moderate potassium depletion achieved by 10 days of dietary potassium restriction and administration of a polystyrene sulfonate potassium exchange resin (Kayexalate). Maximal urinary osmolality (Umax) decreased from 1,094 +/- 58 (mean +/- SEM) to 820 +/- 26 mmol/kg (mOsm/kg) (P less than 0.01) following potassium depletion, but urinary PGE2 excretion did not change (496 +/- 145 and 435 +/- 186 ng/d, respectively). Indomethacin suppressed PGE2 excretion significantly, but failed to increase Umax in either the normal or the potassium-depleted state (1,094 +/- 34 and 825 +/- 56 mmol/kg, respectively). It is concluded that the renal concentrating defect produced by moderate potassium restriction in humans is not mediated by PGE2.\r"

Criteria for inclusion were pyuria, positive urinary culture, and signs or symptoms of pyelonephritis. All patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US) before other diagnostic tests. US identified a potential emergency (hydronephrosis or abscess) in 11 of 98 patients (11.2%). The only significant contributing factor was the presence of diabetes mellitus, which was present in five of 11 emergent conditions and eight of 73 of the remainder (P = 0.003). US is inexpensive, easily obtainable in the emergency room, and sensitive enough to screen patients with pyelonephritis for complications. However, we believe it is mandatory in diabetics, because of the high incidence of abnormalities in this population.\r"

To evaluate the changes more objectively, two indexes, the number of interstitial inflammatory cells and tubulitis percentage, were used. The group means of both of these indexes were statistically higher than those of the autopsy control group, while 14 of the cases (77.8%) showed a significant difference (P less than 0.01) between individual means and the control group means. On the other hand, tubulointerstitial changes in systemic vasculitis seemed to be less prominent than drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) according to these indexes. However, comparing these indexes with those of drug-induced TIN, six cases (33.3%) of systemic angiitis could be regarded as having developed pathologic changes similar to TIN. Statistical difference was not shown in the indexes between those patients with histologic evidence of necrotizing angiitis and those without it. Clinically, urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) was abnormally high in all three examined cases, reflecting the damage of renal tubular epithelial cells. Not only the vascular and glomerular lesions, but also tubulointerstitial changes, should be evaluated in the renal biopsy specimen of systemic vasculitis.\r"

Aluminum can blunt the effect of erythropoietin, in part by interfering with iron bioavailability. This inhibitory effect cannot be completely overcome by aggressive ferrotherapy, but can be reversed with aluminum chelation therapy. A patient is described who developed hematological evidence of aluminum excess after being treated with erythropoietin. The biochemical evidence of functional iron deficiency and the response to aluminum chelation therapy support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of aluminum on erythropoiesis is mediated by the interference of aluminum with the bioavailability of iron.\r"

This case illustrates the danger of administering calcium supplementation and raises questions about the use of normal to high dialysate calcium concentration in the early stages of rhabdomyolysis-induced oliguric ARF. Calcium supplementation should be reserved for patients with clear clinical signs of hypocalcemia and dialysate calcium should be adjusted to prevent excessive positive calcium balance.\r"

In 14 of the 17 mutant haplotypes 7, a previously unreported deletion of the BamHI restriction site in exon 7 of the PAH gene was observed. The abrogation of the BamHI site was shown to be due to a G-to-T transversion, changing Gly 272 to Ter 272 in exon 7 of the gene, thus directly identifying the PKU mutation. Unlike the families of the other PKU patients, the families with this mutation clustered along the southeastern coast of Norway, suggesting a founder effect for this mutation.\r"

  ".W": "A common glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variant characterized by severe enzyme deficiency and B-like electrophoretic mobility is called \"G6PD-Mediterranean\" because it is found in different populations around the Mediterranean Sea. Sequence analysis of Italian subjects has revealed that the molecular basis of G6PD-Mediterranean is a single C-T transition at nucleotide position 563, causing a serine phenylalanine replacement at amino acid position 188. Most G6PD-Mediterranean subjects also have a silent C-T transition (without amino acid replacement) at nucleotide position 1311. Twenty-one unrelated individuals from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel with both severe G6PD deficiency and B-like electrophoretic mobility were tested for both mutations by using amplification followed by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes. All but one had the 563 mutation, and, of these, all but one had the 1311 mutation. Another 24 unrelated Middle Eastern individuals with normal G6PD activity or not known to be G6PD deficient were similarly tested. Four had the silent mutation at position 1311 in the absence of the deficiency mutation at position 563. We conclude that (1) the large majority of Middle Eastern subjects with the G6PD-Mediterranean phenotype have the same mutation found in Italy, (2) the silent mutation is an independent polymorphism in the Middle East, with a frequency of about .13, and (3) the mutation leading to the G6PD-Mediterranean deficiency has probably arisen on a chromosome that already carried the silent mutation.\r"

The precise recombination site was able to be localized to one of 5 bp (5' . . . AGTTC . . . 3') in the middle of the homologous sequences. The exact length of the deletion is 10,000 bp.\r"

Clinically, symptomatic patients had progressive external ophthalmoplegia, muscle weakness and wasting, sensorineural hypoacusia, and, in some cases, vestibular areflexia and tremor. The muscle biopsies of all patients examined showed ragged-red fibers, neurogenic changes, and a partially decreased histochemical reaction to cytochrome c oxidase. Multiple mtDNA heteroplasmy was detected in the patients by both Southern blot analysis and PCR amplification, whereas the unaffected individual had the normal homoplasmic hybridization pattern. These findings confirm and add further details to the existence of a new human disease--defined clinically as a mitochondrial myopathy, genetically as a Mendelian autosomal dominant trait, and molecularly by the accumulation of multiple, large-scale deletions of the mitochondrial genome--that is due to impaired nuclear control during mtDNA replication.\r"

A multilocus analysis with four markers (pMCR-3, pMUC10, FY, and pMLAJ1) spanning the pericentromeric region of chromosome 1 excluded the CMT I gene from this region in six pedigrees but gave some evidence for linkage to the region of Duffy in one pedigree. Linkage of the CMT I gene to markers in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17 (markers pA10-41, pEW301, p3.6, and pTH17.19) was established; however, in these seven pedigrees homogeneity analysis with chromosome 17 markers detected significant genetic heterogeneity. This analysis suggested that three of the seven pedigrees are not linked to this same region. Overall, two of the seven CMT I pedigrees were not linked to markers tested from chromosomes 1 or 17. These results confirm genetic heterogeneity in CMT I and implicate the existence of a third autosomal locus, in addition to a locus on chromosome 17, and a probable locus on chromosome 1. This evidence of etiological heterogeneity, supported by statistical tests, will have to be taken into consideration when fine-structure genetic maps of the regions around CMT I are constructed.\r"

The method is based on the preferential PCR amplification of human DNA in rodent/human hybrids when primers specific to the human Alu repeat element are used. MspI and SstI RFLPs associated with S6.1 were identified and used in linkage analysis of both a previously reported and a newly identified French-Acadian kindred segregating autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). A cumulative peak lod score of 3.41 at a peak recombination fraction of .12 indicates that this marker is linked to the CMT 1A locus but is at a distance from the disease gene. Thus, the marker S6.1 will be useful in further delineating the candidate region for the CMT gene when its location with respect to pA10-41 and 1516, two other markers from 17p11.2 which have previously demonstrated close linkage to the CMT locus, has been determined.\r"

We have refined the localization of DXS426 both physically, by mapping it to a deletion which spans the interval Xp21.3-Xp11.23, and genetically, by studying multiply informative crossovers which indicate that DXS426 lies between DXS7 and DXS255 (i.e., Xp11.4-Xp11.22). As this is the region which contains the RP2 gene, RP2 families could be identified on the basis of linkage of XLRP to DXS426. Multiply informative crossovers in two RP2 families indicate that the most likely location of the RP2 gene is between DXS426 and DXS7. DXS426 is therefore an important highly informative marker for the purposes of carrier detection and early diagnosis of RP2 and for the localization of the disease gene.\r"

The F and G morphs were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other but were in weak linkage disequilibrium with the A and B morphs defined in PstI digests. Data for haplotypes formed by using the A and F morphs improved the lod score for linkage between the disease locus for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) and D10Z1 (Z = 14.06 at theta = 0) in the six large families studied by Wu et al. Furthermore, the locus that codes for a distinct phenotype, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with parathyroid tumors (PTs) and no pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) (referred to as MTC with PTs), in one of the families was closely linked to two markers, D10Z1 and RBP3, with lodscores of 2.86 and 3.54, respectively, at theta = 0. A possible allelic association was noted between disease phenotypes and centromeric haplotypes. The phenotype MTC and PHEOs with and without PTs was associated with the same relatively common centromeric haplotype (A + B-F-G-) in the four families in which all four morphs could be determined, while the phenotype MTC with PTs was associated with the rare centromeric haplotype (A-B-F-G+) in one family.\r"

No recombinants were observed between D10S94 and D10Z1 or MEN2A. D10S94 maps in proximal 10q11.2 very near to MEN2A. There are three possible orders for the six loci that we investigated from the centromeric region of chromosome 10. At present the genetic data do not allow us to order MEN2A with respect to D10Z1 and D10S94. The three possible orders are FNRB-D10Z1-D10S94-MEN2A-RBP3-D10S15, FNRB-D10Z1-MEN2A-D10S94-RBP3-D10S15, and FNRB-MEN2A-D10Z1-D10S94-RBP3-D10S15. In view of the fact that no recombinants between D10S94 and MEN2A or between D10S94 and D10Z1 were observed, the combined haplotypes formed from RFLPs and D10Z1 and D10S94 will increase the informativeness and accuracy of genotype prediction for at-risk members of the families having the MEN 2A syndrome, particularly when the affected parent is female. The localization of D10S94 with respect to MEN2A will prove valuable in experiments directed toward cloning the MEN2A locus.\r"

This method is based on estimating the proportion of genetic material, R, shared identical by descent (IBD) by sibling pairs in a specified chromosomal region, on the basis of their marker genotypes at a set of marker loci spanning the region. The mean and variance of the distribution of R conditional on IBD status and recombination pattern between two marker loci are derived as a function of the distance between the two loci. The distribution of the estimates of R is exemplified using data on 22 loci on chromosome 7. A method of using the estimated R values and observed values of a quantitative trait in a set of sibships to estimate the proportion of total genetic variance explained by loci in the region of interest is presented. Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used to show that this method is more powerful than existing methods of quantitative linkage analysis based on sib pairs. It is also shown through simulation studies that the proposed method is sensitive to genetic variation arising from both a single locus of large effect as well as from several loosely linked loci of moderate phenotypic effect.\r"

  ".W": "A genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers close to the gene (APC) for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) on chromosome 5q is reported. One hundred fifty-five typed members of nine FAP kindred provided more than 90 meioses for linkage analysis. A number of crucial recombination events have been identified which are informative at three or more loci, allowing confident ordering of parts of the map. There was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity, with all families showing linkage of at least one chromosome 5 marker to the gene. Recombination data and two-point linkage analysis support a locus order of centromere-pi 227-C11P11-ECB27-L5.62-APC-EF5.44-YN5.48-telomer e, although EF5.44 could lie in the interval L5.62-APC or ECB27-L5.62. No recombinants were identified between APC and either EF5.44 or YN5.48, but published deletion mapping in colorectal carcinomas and linkage analysis in FAP suggest that YN5.48 is 1-3 cM from APC. The present study suggests that YN5.48 and L5.62 delineate a small region of chromosome 5 within which the EF5.44 locus lies very close to the APC gene. These data not only allow use of flanking markers for presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP but also provide a high-density map of the region for isolation of the APC gene itself and for further assessment of the role of chromosome 5 deletions in the biology of sporadic colorectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The replication status of the fragile X chromosomes was studied in short-term cultures of lymphocytes from six female heterozygous carriers. The fragile X was induced by adding 0.1 microM fluorodeoxyuridine during the last 24 h of culturing. The replication status of the X chromosomes was studied using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) antibody method. BrdUrd was added (1) at a final concentration of 0.2 micrograms/ml during the early S phase of chromosome replication (16-10 h before harvest), (2) at 0.2 microgram/ml during the late S phase (the last 6 h of culturing), (3) at 20 micrograms/ml during the early S phase, and (4) at 20 micrograms/ml during the late S phase. BrdUrd that was incorporated into replicating chromosomes was detected by using a nuclease and BrdUrd monoclonal antibody. The frequency of the fragile X was reduced by BrdUrd treatment. The degree of reduction was more severe in the 20 micrograms/ml than in the 0.2 microgram/ml series and was more severe with late S than with early S treatment. Of the early- and late-replicating fragile X chromosomes, those which were actively replicating during a BrdUrd treatment were more reduced than the others. Thus, the average rate of early and late S treatment with 0.2 microgram BrdUrd/ml was assumed to be the closest reflection of the situation in vivo. There was no correlation between the average rate of the early replicating, active fragile X and the intelligence of the heterozygous carriers studied.\r"

  ".W": "The debrisoquine polymorphism is a common genetic defect that results in deficient oxidation of debrisoquine and numerous other drugs. These compounds are metabolized by a form of cytochrome P450, designated CYP2D6. Some 5%-10% of Caucasians are unable to metabolize debrisoquine, because of mutant alleles of CYP2D6. A CYP2D6 allele was isolated from leukocyte DNA of an individual who was deficient in debrisoquine metabolism. The gene was completely sequenced, including 725 bp of upstream and 400 bp of downstream DNA. Several base changes were uncovered within the exons, resulting in four amino acid differences between the mutant and wild-type allele. Most important, a single base change G1934----A at the junction of the third intron and four exon would result in an incorrectly spliced primary transcript and in an mRNA having a single base deletion. This deletion presumably disrupts the mRNA reading frame, resulting in a truncated protein. These data establish unequivocally that the debrisoquine polymorphism is the result of mutant CYP2D6 alleles and provide a framework to design a genetic test for this drug oxidation deficiency. A defective CYP2D7 allele was also isolated and completely sequenced, providing evidence that gene conversions have occurred between CYP2D6 and CYP2D7.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Currently, there is no established therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), a recently defined illness that has been associated with a variety of immunologic abnormalities. Based on the hypothesis that a chronic viral infection or an immunoregulatory defect is involved in the pathogenesis of CFS, the therapeutic benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin G (IV IgG) was evaluated in a group of patients with CFS. Additionally, serum immunoglobulin concentrations and peripheral blood lymphocyte subset numbers were measured at the outset of the study, and the effect of IV IgG therapy on IgG subclass levels was determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with CFS were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of IV IgG. The treatment regimen consisted of IV IgG (1 g/kg) or intravenous placebo (1% albumin solution) administered every 30 days for 6 months. Participants completed a self-assessment form prior to each of the six treatments, which was used to measure severity of symptoms, functional status, and health perceptions. Patients were also asked to report adverse experiences defined as worsening of symptoms occurring within 48 hours of each treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients completed the trial. At baseline, all 28 patients complained of moderate to severe fatigue, and measures of social functioning and health perceptions showed marked impairment. Low levels of IgG1 were found in 12 (42.9%), and 18 (64.3%) had low levels of IgG3. At the end of the study, no significant therapeutic benefit could be detected in terms of symptom amelioration or improvement in functional status, despite restoration of IgG1 levels to a normal range. Major adverse experiences were observed in 20% of both the IV IgG and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that IV IgG is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in CFS. In addition to the ongoing need for placebo-controlled trials of candidate therapies for CFS, an expanded research effort is needed to define the etiology and pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by profound fatigue, neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and frequent abnormalities in cell-mediated immunity. No effective therapy is known. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients (40 with abnormal cell-mediated immunity) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of high-dose intravenously administered immunoglobulin G. The patients received three intravenous infusions of a placebo solution or immunoglobulin at a dose of 2 g/kg/month. Assessment of the severity of symptoms and associated disability, both before and after treatment, was completed at detailed interviews by a physician and psychiatrist, who were unaware of the treatment status. In addition, any change in physical symptoms and functional capacity was recorded using visual analogue scales, while changes in psychologic morbidity were assessed using patient-rated indices of depression. Cell-mediated immunity was evaluated by T-cell subset analysis, delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing, and lymphocyte transformation with phytohemagglutinin. RESULTS: At the interview conducted by the physician 3 months after the final infusion, 10 of 23 (43%) immunoglobulin recipients and three of the 26 (12%) placebo recipients were assessed as having responded with a substantial reduction in their symptoms and recommencement of work, leisure, and social activities. The patients designated as having responded had improvement in physical, psychologic, and immunologic measures (p less than 0.01 for each). CONCLUSION: Immunomodulatory treatment with immunoglobulin is effective in a significant number of patients with CFS, a finding that supports the concept that an immunologic disturbance may be important in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To construct and test prospectively a bleeding risk index for estimating the probability of major bleeding in hospitalized patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an inception cohort of 617 patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy in one hospital, data were gathered retrospectively and bleeding was classified using reliable explicit criteria. We constructed a bleeding risk index by identifying and weighting independent predictors of major bleeding using a multivariate proportional-hazards model. The bleeding risk index was tested in 394 other patients prospectively identified in a second hospital. The index was compared to physicians' predictions. RESULTS: Major bleeding developed before discharge in 61 of all 1,011 patients (6%). The bleeding risk index included four independent risk factors for major in-hospital bleeding: the number of specific comorbid conditions; heparin use in patients aged 60 years or older; maximal prothrombin or partial thromboplastin time 2.0 or more times control; liver dysfunction worsening during therapy. In the testing group, the index predicted major bleeding, which occurred in 3% of 235 low-risk patients, 16% of 96 middle-risk patients, and 19% of 63 high-risk patients (p less than 0.001). The bleeding risk index performed as well as physicians' predictions, and integration of the bleeding risk index with physicians' predictions led to a classification system that was more sensitive (p = 0.03) than physicians' predictions alone. In 86% of patients with a high risk of major bleeding, we identified specific ways of improving therapy, e.g., avoiding overanticoagulation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. CONCLUSION: The bleeding risk index provides valid estimates of the probability of major bleeding in hospitalized patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy and complements physicians' predictions. The possibility that bleeding can be prevented in high-risk patients warrants prospective evaluation.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 105 patients with a documented morphologic diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia were reviewed for the purpose of this analysis. All patients had an extensive workup at presentation, and cytogenetic analysis was performed in 103 patients, using the Giemsa banding technique with trypsin pretreatment on 24-hour cultured cells. RESULTS: The specific cytogenetic classification in the 103 patients who had the karyotypic analysis was as follows: diploid 27%; Philadelphia chromosome-positive 13%; hyperdiploid 12%; B-cell karyotype 6%; 6q- and 14q+ abnormalities 4%; pseudodiploid 8%; hypodiploid 2%; and insufficient metaphases 28%. B-cell, 6q- or 14q+, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive karyotypes tended to correlate with other known negative prognostic factors. Patients with diploid, hyperdiploid, pseudodiploid, and hypodiploid karyotypes or with insufficient metaphases could be combined into one group with a favorable prognosis. In this group, the remission rate with induction chemotherapy was 89%, the median complete remission duration was 26 months, and the median survival was 25 months, with a 3-year survival rate of 45%. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive, B-cell, and 6q- or 14q+ abnormalities collectively had an unfavorable prognosis. Their response rate to induction chemotherapy was 65%, the median response duration was 7 months, and the median survival was 8 months, with a 3-year survival rate of less than 10%. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the pretreatment bone marrow karyotype is an important part of the evaluation of adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia and provides significant prognostic information.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To investigate the pathologic substrates of sudden death in young competitive athletes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two cases of sudden death in young competitive athletes occurring in the Veneto region (northern Italy) in the period January 1979 to December 1989 were studied by postmortem examination. The athletes included 19 males and three females, ranging in age from 11 to 35 years (mean, 23 years). RESULTS: In 18 cases, sudden death occurred during (16 cases) or immediately after (two cases) a competitive sport activity. In 10 subjects, sudden death was apparently the first sign of disease. Postmortem examination disclosed that this fatality was due to arrhythmic cardiac arrest in 17 cases; among these, right ventricular cardiomyopathy, also known as \"right ventricular dysplasia,\" was the most frequently encountered cardiovascular disease (six cases), followed by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (four cases), conduction system pathology (three cases), anomalous origin of right coronary artery from the wrong aortic sinus (two cases), and mitral valve prolapse (two cases). In two athletes, the abrupt lethal complication was \"mechanical\" and consisted of pulmonary embolism and rupture of the aorta; in three athletes, death was due to a cerebral cause. All athletes with right ventricular cardiomyopathy died during effort, and most had a history of palpitations and/or syncope. Whenever available, electrocardiographic (ECG) tracings showed inverted T waves in precordial leads and/or left bundle branch block ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicopathologic correlations indicate that in the Veneto region of Italy, right ventricular cardiomyopathy is not so rare among the cardiovascular diseases associated with the risk of arrhythmic cardiac arrest, and seems to account for the majority of cases of sudden death in young athletes; this disorder can be suspected during life on the basis of prodromal symptoms and ECG signs.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that during the natural history of sporadic nontoxic goiter (SNG), a diffuse goiter precedes a multinodular goiter with gradual development of autonomous thyroid function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 102 consecutive patients with SNG (seven male, 95 female) was performed. Thyroid volume was measured by ultrasonography, and plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by a sensitive assay (TSH immunoradiometric assay). RESULTS: Patients with a multinodular goiter were older and had a larger thyroid volume than patients with a diffuse or uninodular goiter. Plasma free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3) were higher and plasma TSH was lower in patients than in normal subjects. Free T4 was higher in the subgroup of patients with a multinodular goiter and a decreased TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Plasma TSH (y, in mU/L) was negatively related to thyroid volume (x, in mL): y = 8.2x-0.667 (r = 0.578, p less than 0.001). Thyroid volume (y, in mL) was positively related to age (x, in years): y = -21.8 + 2.0x (r = 0.455, p less than 0.001); and to duration of goiter (x, in years): y = 40.6 + 2.1x (r = 0.505, p less than 0.001). The annual increase in thyroid volume was calculated at 4.5%. CONCLUSION: The data suggest a continuous growth of SNG and provide support for the concept of increasing thyroid nodularity and autonomy of thyroid function--related to increasing thyroid volume--during the natural history of this disorder.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 131 untreated patients with biopsy-proven primary systemic amyloidosis diagnosed and evaluated at the Mayo Clinic. No patient had multiple myeloma. The minimum follow-up of surviving patients is 8 years. No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS: The median survival of patients with an increased beta 2-microglobulin level was 10.8 months, compared with patients with a normal beta 2-microglobulin level (less than or equal to 2.7 micrograms/mL, 0.23 mumol/L) of 32.9 months (p less than 0.001). In a multivariate proportional-hazards model, the best model included congestive heart failure (p less than 0.0001) and increased beta 2-microglobulin levels (p less than 0.05). After adjustment for the presence of congestive heart failure, beta 2-microglobulin level remained significant. When the analysis was restricted to those patients with normal renal function, the median survival of those with an elevated beta 2-microglobulin level was 9.1 months versus 39.4 months for those with a normal level (p less than 0.001). The serum level of beta 2-microglobulin was increased in patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria with or without renal insufficiency (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The serum beta 2-microglobulin level should be measured routinely in all patients with primary systemic amyloidosis because it provides a useful objective factor to identify subsets of patients with this disease who have unfavorable outcomes.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of, risk factors for, and outcome of contrast nephropathy in azotemic diabetic patients undergoing coronary angiography. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine insulin-dependent diabetics with a mean serum creatinine level of 522 mumol/L (5.9 mg/dL) underwent coronary angiography as part of a pretransplant evaluation. Twenty-four azotemic diabetics undergoing inpatient evaluation not including angiography for transplantation formed the control group. Serum creatinine measurements obtained at baseline and after radiocontrast exposure were compared in patients and control subjects. Risk factors for contrast nephropathy were evaluated in patients with a 25% or greater increase in serum creatinine. RESULTS: Serum creatinine was significantly elevated 24 hours after radiocontrast exposure in patients (557 +/- 141 mumol/L versus 522 +/- 141 mumol/L, mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001) but not in controls. Seven patients required dialysis within 6 days of coronary angiography and two additional patients required dialysis within 14 days. Contrast nephropathy, defined as a serum creatinine increase of greater than 25% when measured 48 hours after radiocontrast exposure, occurred in 50% of patients and no controls. Univariate analysis of risk factors for contrast nephropathy revealed a significant association with dye quantity (p = 0.002), mean arterial pressure less than 100 mm Hg (p = 0.02), and ejection fraction less than 50% (p = 0.04). Stepwise logistic regression verified the independence of dye quantity and low mean arterial pressure but not low ejection fraction as risk factors for contrast nephropathy. Follow-up serum creatinine values were not significantly different in patients and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Azotemic patients with diabetes are at high risk of developing contrast nephropathy even when less than 100 mL of radiocontrast agent is used. The acute renal failure is reversible but precipitates the need for short-term dialysis in some patients. Radiocontrast quantity is an important risk factor not previously noted. The incidence of contrast nephropathy can be minimized by using less than 30 mL of radiocontrast agent.\r"

  ".W": "Therapeutic efficacy is often studied with observational surveys of patients whose treatments were selected nonexperimentally. The results of these surveys are distrusted because of the fear that biased results occur in the absence of experimental principles, particularly randomization. The purpose of the current study was to develop and validate improved observational study designs by incorporating many of the design principles and patient assembly procedures of the randomized trial. The specific topic investigated was the prophylactic effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy after an acute myocardial infarction. To accomplish the research objective, three sets of data were compared. First, we developed a restricted cohort based on the eligibility criteria of the randomized clinical trial; second, we assembled an expanded cohort using the same design principles except for not restricting patient eligibility; and third, we used the data from the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), whose results served as the gold standard for comparison. In this research, the treatment difference in death rates for the restricted cohort and the BHAT trial was nearly identical. In contrast, the expanded cohort had a larger treatment difference than was observed in the BHAT trial. We also noted the important and largely neglected role that eligibility criteria may play in ensuring the validity of treatment comparisons and study outcomes. The new methodologic strategies we developed may improve the quality of observational studies and may be useful in assessing the efficacy of the many medical/surgical therapies that cannot be tested with randomized clinical trials.\r"

To determine the chronic effect of calcium channel blockade in vivo, we conducted a randomized, double blind, 16 week study comparing the effects of two pharmacologic antihypertensive agents, the calcium channel blocker diltiazem and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on parameters of calcium homeostasis. Both diltiazem and captopril lowered blood pressure to a similar degree. Neither drug produced any significant change in blood levels of total and ionized calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus, which affect the regulation of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. In addition, at eight or 16 weeks following initiation, neither drug altered the serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1,25-D). Chronic calcium channel blockade with diltiazem does not alter serum parameters of calcium homeostasis and, thus, should not affect bone mineralization.\r"

It is suggested that an agitator should be used during the incubation, because the magnetic solid phase was precipitated and could not be suspended well in plasmas. Further, the thawed reagents should not be used for the assay. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.96, p less than 0.01) was found between ARC and enzymatic activity of renin (PRA) in plasma samples obtained from hypertensive patients. The mean values of ARC were 22.8 +/- 3.6 pg/ml in normal subjects, 22.5 +/- 5.3 in patients with EH having medium levels of PRA, 113.7 +/- 11.7 in patients with renovascular hypertension, and undetectable in patients with primary aldosteronism. The results indicated good and reliable performance of the direct renin RIA, which is clinically useful to investigate the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

Despite lack of effect on plasma glucagon, indomethacin decreased the insulin response to arginine. The fall in free fatty acids during arginine infusion was decreased by indomethacin, which may in part be due to increased plasma growth hormone levels.

  ".W": "The adverse biochemical effects of thiazide use are of uncertain clinical significance. Thiazides raise LDL cholesterol only slightly in long-term studies and do not decrease HDL cholesterol. The evidence linking thiazide-induced hypokalemia with arrhythmias and sudden death is tenuous at best. Thiazide diuretics cause glucose intolerance, but no strong evidence has been advanced to suggest that this is dangerous. Because these effects are probably related to hypokalemia, a randomized trial comparing the effects of thiazides with thiazides plus a potassium-sparing diuretic on LDL cholesterol, ectopy on 48 hour ambulatory cardiac monitoring, fasting glucose and insulin, and post-glucose tolerance glucose and insulin would be of interest. The most compelling reason for continuing to use thiazides is that they have been shown in long-term randomized studies to reduce cardiovascular risk. Beta-blockers are the only other class of anti-hypertensive agent for which this claim can be made. The importance of long-term clinical trials in assessing the efficacy and toxicity of therapeutic agents is illustrated by the study that found clofibrate reduced cholesterol levels and coronary disease but increased total mortality. This finding remained undetected until a large randomized long-term trial was completed. Thiazide diuretics have not reduced the rate of coronary disease to the degree expected from epidemiologic studies, but the short length of the randomized trials may be responsible. It is not clear that other anti-hypertensive agents will be superior. Thiazides are less expensive than other anti-hypertensive agents being touted as metabolically safer; the cost issue is not a trivial matter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical trials of macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-3 have all demonstrated significant effects on the peripheral blood counts of the recipients. The clinical usefulness of these agents in ameliorating post-chemotherapy myelosuppression, in the treatment of other cytopenias, and in enhancing engraftment after bone marrow transplantation has already been demonstrated. Potential applications to the therapy and diagnosis of other clinical disorders is under study. The history of the elucidation of these growth factors, our current understanding of their properties, interactions, and clinical effects, and the potential prospects for their future use in the manipulation of human blood cell production are the subject of this review.\r"

  ".W": "Pressure for national standards of medical practice is increasing from cost control initiatives, medical malpractice liability, and the desire to simplify complex practice problems. Good standards need to be academically sound, focused enough to be clinically useful, yet flexible enough to allow for the realities of practice. Standards have already been created by several professional societies, including anesthesiology and cardiology in internal medicine. Although physician education is primary, controlling the use of expensive new technologies is an unwritten but important secondary goal. While standards have reduced malpractice liability in some professional groups, some clinicians are concerned that standards will be too academic and unrealistic. Currently, third-party payers are watching the development of practice standards but are hesitant to use them as criteria for determination of reimbursement. The federal government has a major interest in practice standards as a means of both monitoring quality of care and controlling costs. A number of agencies are studying the development of standards and their implications for use. Recent articles questioning the usefulness of common diagnostic tests and even the routine physical examination have raised concern among internists that restriction of practice and reimbursement will follow. Some evolving standards, such as screening for breast cancer, seem to ignore the realities of clinical practice and may generate more cost than they save. Internists need to provide input as standards are developed to guarantee appropriateness and feasibility.\r"

  ".W": "We measured the variability in volume, total cells, cell types, and proteins in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid recovered from 10 volunteers (five smokers, five non-smokers) lavaged repeatedly over a three-year period. Thirty lavages were performed using a rigorously standardized approach. Differential counts on the cytospin preparations were performed by three independent readers and interobserver variability in the interpretation of these counts measured. Variability in interpreting the cellular counts was less in smokers than non-smokers and decreased as the number of cells of any particular type increased. Only one reader interpreting the mean percentage of cells recovered of one cell type (neutrophils) in only one smoking group, the nonsmokers, was significantly different from the other two. There was also considerable variability in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid total protein, albumin, IgG, and IgA. Expressing albumin and IgG as a percentage of total protein recovered and expressing IgA and albumin as a ratio in nonsmokers lessened the variability of these parameters. Mean and standard deviations of the cellular and protein concentrations showed that large differences in these parameters would be necessary in order to attribute these changes to changes in the underlying pulmonary status. Excessive variability in nearly all parameters in this group without recognized lung disease challenges the usefulness of this test in the clinical assessment of patients serially followed because of underlying lung disease.\r"

Twenty-eight cases of Lyme disease were identified in Virginia, of which eight cases occurred in 1986 and 20 in 1987. Lyme disease appears to be increasing in frequency in Virginia and moving southward along the Eastern Atlantic Seaboard.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged rapid ventricular pacing (VP) in dogs produces low output heart failure (HF) characterized by cardiomegaly, ascites, and elevated plasma renin and norepinephrine levels. Commercially available pacemaker generators have a protective circuit that prevents pacing at rapid rates. Previously, investigators have had to use either external temporary pacemakers or customized generators to pace at rates greater than 130 beats per minute (bpm). The authors have developed a simple method to perform rapid VP by gluing magnets on Medtronic VVI generators, which allows programming in a temporary mode to sustain rates up to 400 bpm. Our results using 10 generators in 55 dogs demonstrates that HF is produced in all dogs when VP is maintained at 250 bpm for an average of 28 days. Technical difficulties during our early experience with this technique included magnets becoming unglued, loss of capture, and wound complications requiring generator removal. Thus, our method reuses commercially available generators to rapidly pace the ventricles and induce HF.\r"

The method used was a double antibody radioimmunoassay using radioiodinated purified aldolase A, B, or C subunits as the ligand, specific chicken antibodies to aldolase isozymes and rabbit antibodies to chicken IgG. The Iodogen method was used for iodination of the purified isozyme subunits in this study. Human brain tissue contained similar concentrations of aldolase A and aldolase C, and a smaller amount of aldolase B, which was the main isozyme of liver tissue. Levels of serum aldolase A were greater than 203 ng/ml, the upper limit of normal, in six of 24 patients with cerebral infarction and in 11 of 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage. Nine of 24 patients with cerebral infarction and 16 of 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage had serum aldolase C levels greater than 4.1 ng/ml, the upper limit in normal sera. These data suggest that serum aldolase C may be a more specific and sensitive marker of cerebrovascular diseases than aldolase A. We also demonstrated that serial measurement of serum aldolase C in patients with cerebrovascular diseases might be useful in estimating prognosis, since serially increasing serum aldolase C levels during the course of these diseases were correlated with a high mortality rate.\r"

Clinical trials of macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-3 have all demonstrated significant effects on the peripheral blood counts of the recipients. The clinical usefulness of at least two of these agents in ameliorating post-chemotherapy myelosuppression, in the treatment of other cytopenias, and in enhancing engraftment after bone marrow transplantation has already been demonstrated. Potential applications to the therapy and diagnosis of other clinical disorders is under study. The history of the elucidation of these growth factors, our current understanding of their properties, interactions, and clinical effects, and the potential prospects for their future use in the manipulation of human blood cell production are the subject of this review.\r"

This technology allows virtually any fragment of DNA large enough to contain an entire gene to become integrated into the germline of the recipient animal. The newly inserted DNA will be inherited like endogenous genes, and will be expressed as RNA and protein at tissue locations and abundance depending on regulatory elements attached to the coding DNA. It is possible to clone a particular gene, change a regulatory coding sequence, and reinsert the gene to determine the effect of the change on expression and function of the gene.\r"

Changes in the management of patients with PCP have included different dosages and routes of administration for chemotherapy, improved overall survival, and a recent increase in the number of patients surviving episodes of respiratory failure. In addition, infection with mycobacteria tuberculosis (M.Tb.) has emerged as a major public health problem. The pattern of M.Tb. is distinct from non-immunocompromised patients though response to therapy usually occurs.\r"
