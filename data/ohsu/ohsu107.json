These features and other evidence suggest that it is not a malignant neoplasm but a benign, potentially controllable and reversible hyperplasia.\r"

These estimates do not account for new infections after 1985 nor very long incubation periods and are thus the smallest numbers to be expected. Even if new infections can be effectively prevented, the epidemic will be five times larger than the number of cases observed so far.\r"

This excess risk among ex-smokers is only to a small extent explained by their higher blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, and body-mass index. An increased prevalence of IHD in men who had recently given up smoking also made a small contribution to excess risk. In both current and former cigarette smokers, the number of years a man had smoked cigarettes (\"smoking-years\") was the clearest indicator of IHD risk due to cigarettes. The major benefit of giving up smoking may lie in halting the accumulation of smoking years.\r"

A measure of risk controlling for age, the logarithm of the odds ratio, showed that for liver disorders, upper gastrointestinal disorders, myocardial infarction, other cardiovascular disorders, and respiratory disorders, rising consumption of alcohol was related to increased risk of hospital admission relative to abstention. The risk of admission for the remaining heterogeneous category of disorders was lower than that for abstention, perhaps reflecting the effect of chronic illness on drinking habits, and also suggesting that the link between alcohol consumption and medical diagnoses is not simply due to greater frankness about drinking in hospital inpatients.\r"

Better knowledge of such beliefs, it is argued, will enable the doctor to counter ignorance, enhance communication, and reduce non-compliance. The view advanced here is that the significance of patients' beliefs and their frequent resistance to rational correction will emerge only if they are seen as components in a process of \"narrative reconstruction\". It is suggested that the main difficulty is not ignorance but rather the fact that doctor and patient have different purposes: whereas the doctor's objective is to explain the aetiology of the disease, the patient may be more concerned to make sense of the disruption caused by the disease.\r"

In contrast, exercise studies done during the evaluation of anti-anginal drugs indicate that exertional angina can be provoked frequently and repeatedly without apparent risk, and other studies have shown that repeated exercise to the onset of angina is not only safe but improves exercise tolerance. Epidemiological investigations suggest that sudden death and myocardial infarction do not commonly occur during exertion, and our knowledge of pathology indicates that both events are usually caused by acute coronary thrombosis. Many physicians seem to treat the symptom of angina because they are unduly motivated by fear of the underlying potentially fatal disease for which angina is a marker. Such an attitude will tend to cause undue anxiety among patients, will lead to unnecessary restriction of patients' activities, and may result in excessive invasive treatment of mild angina.\r"

Each head contains both an actin binding site and an ATPase site and is formed from the NH2-terminal half of one of the two heavy chains (relative molecular mass, Mr, 200,000) and a pair of light chains; the so-called regulatory and essential light chains of approximately Mr 20,000 each. Recently we have identified Trp 130 of the myosin heavy chain from rabbit skeletal muscle as an active-site amino-acid residue after labelling with a new photoaffinity analogue of ADP, N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-2-aminoethyl diphosphate (NANDP). Nonspecific labelling was eliminated by first trapping NANDP at the active site with thiol crosslinking agents. Exclusive labelling of the heavy chains with no labelling of the light chains agreed with previous findings that the heavy chains alone contain the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity of rabbit skeletal myosin. Here we report similar photolabelling experiments with smooth muscle myosin (chicken gizzard) in which 3H-NANDP is trapped at the active site with vanadate and which show that both the heavy chains and the essential light chains are labelled. The results indicate that both chains contribute to the ATP binding site and represent the first direct evidence for participation of the essential light chains in the active site of any type of myosin.\r"

  ".W": "Alternative splicing of eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors is now known to be of widespread importance in generating multiple transcripts from a single gene. This phenomenon has emphasized the problem of the way in which splice sites are selected; recent studies have discussed the role of secondary structure or affinity and spatial relationships in this selection. Splice site sequences vary widely, although a loose consensus has been derived for the 9 bases around the 5' splice site and for a longer region around the 3' splice site. Mutagenesis experiments have defined the sequences essential for a potential 5' splice site, but, except for some experiments with the E1a gene of adenovirus, these experiments have not examined 5' splice site sequences for features responsible for site preference where alternative splicing sites exist. Such tests require a choice of site: an appropriate reference site and a constant position at which test sites are introduced. We have begun a series of experiments designed to show whether splice site sequences can be ranked in a hierarchy of preferential use. Here we show that the archetypal consensus sequence is used efficiently, and characterize the cryptic sites of beta-globin: sequences alone can explain why these sites are not normally used. We also show with the E1a gene of adenovirus, a simple example of alternative splicing, that one of the two 5' splice sites used by this gene is intrinsically stronger. We also demonstrate that tandem repeats and secondary structure influence the choice of sites in vivo. We discuss the mechanism of splice site selection.\r"

  ".W": "Introns are excised from full-length transcripts (pre-messenger RNAs) of eukaryotic genes in two steps. First, the pre-mRNA is cleaved at the 5' splice site and a branched (lariat) intermediate is formed. Then, cleavage at the 3' splice site and ligation of the two exons leads to the release of the lariat intron. The intron sequence which accepts the 5' end to form the lariat branch is strictly conserved in yeast, but shows more variation in eukaryotes. To investigate the requirements for branch formation in eukaryotes further, we have studied in vitro splicing of a rabbit globin gene intron with mutations of the normal branch-accepting adenosine nucleotide. We conclude that all four nucleotides can serve as branch acceptors, but that A and C are preferred to G and U in lariat formation. Mutation of the normal A to G or U can lead to an A residue one nucleotide upstream of the normal branch site being used instead. Only branches to A or C participate efficiently in the second splicing step.\r"

To permanently prevent this annual human destruction, the prevention agenda should include advocating for air bags in all cars, helmet use for all motorcyclists, the elimination of handguns, and the regionalization of all trauma care. After this is accomplished, we can continue working on preventing other neurotrauma problems.\r"

The approaches outlined in this article merely scratch the surface because the list of possible deficits is inexhaustible. The behavioral and cognitive capacity during the various phases of recovery dictate the intervention method that will be appropriate and successful, with concepts and tasks progressing from the simple to the more complex. When confusion, agitation, and inappropriate behavior are evident, safety is a prime concern. Some individuals do not progress beyond this stage. Placement and appropriate future planning are major issues in this situation. When behavior becomes more appropriate, inpatient rehabilitation efforts will be most beneficial and successful, with the focus on helping the individual regain functional skills. Improvement may be rather dramatic during this time, especially when compared with previous stages. Recovery beyond this point, with intact memory, goal-directed behavior, adequate socialization skills, and vocational rehabilitation, occurs over an extended period of time, perhaps years. With discharge, new concerns for the individual and family emerge as the reality of the situation becomes clearer. Health care providers in the community setting must recognize the effects of injury on the individual and the resulting psychosocial stresses and strains on the individual and family. Adequate neuromedical and neuropsychological follow-up are essential during the outpatient recovery phase to monitor progress and provide input for future plans.\r"

Indeed, according to Bond, the pattern of stresses the family encounters changes with time, with one of the most significant points being in the first days after discharge from the hospital when they realize and accept the full extent of the victim's deficits. It is to this end that nursing intervention throughout hospitalization is geared, and it is during this time that we cannot forget that nursing management may still be required. In the case of neurotrauma, the patient and family are not \"cured\" when they leave the hospital, for many their problems are just beginning. Let us develop mechanisms through which continued professional support can be made available to the families of neurologically impaired patients both during and following hospitalization.\r"

Such injuries may be difficult to detect, and the clinician must maintain a high degree of suspicion for their presence. Clinical findings are nonspecific, but the nurse should focus on assessing the adequacy of cardiac output and tissue perfusion. Initial management of the patient with blunt cardiac trauma is the same as for any trauma patient: stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation. Intravascular volume replacement is an important aspect of the resuscitation. Injuries such as aortic transection or ventricular rupture lead to exsanguination and the need for rapid infusion of large volumes of blood. On the other hand, cardiac function may be severely depressed with myocardial contusion and septal or valvular rupture; volume replacement must proceed cautiously.\r"

The nurse must be able to rapidly and effectively perform a primary survey, recognize the clinical manifestations of life-threatening thoracic injuries, and intervene in the care of the patient to help stabilize and maintain the patient's respiratory function. The nurse must not only be able to asses, but must also be able to technically intervene rapidly and effectively. Other potential life-threatening injuries must remain uppermost in the nurse's mind. Continual, ongoing monitoring of the patient's status must be an integral part of the nurse's actions. If these activities are judiciously employed, perhaps the mortality rate will decrease and the thoracic trauma victim will survive, capable of leading a full and productive life in our society. This is quality patient care.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiopulmonary bypass, especially when prolonged, may result in hemostatic failure and pulmonary dysfunction, which has been attributed to changes in platelets and leukocytes, respectively. It has been well documented that contact of blood with synthetic surfaces causes platelet activation. In this report, we explore mechanisms of the activation of neutrophils during simulated in vitro extracorporeal circulation and document the release of neutrophil lactoferrin and elastase during clinical cardiopulmonary bypass (CCB). Inhibition in the simulated circuit by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and lidocaine suggests different mechanisms for release of neutrophil-specific proteins. During CCB with a bubble oxygenator it was observed that platelet counts fell to 42% +/- 2% of baseline. In addition, beta-thromboglobulin antigen (beta TG), a platelet-specific, alpha-granule protein marker reflecting the release reaction, increased from 0.15 +/- 0.05 to 0.84 +/- 0.11 microgram/mL. Neutrophil counts decreased to 67% +/- 7% of prebypass levels but then gradually rose as bypass continued. Both lactoferrin, a neutrophil-specific granule marker, and neutrophil elastase, an azurophilic granule marker, increased in plasma threefold to 1.66 +/- 0.33 micrograms/mL and 1.65 +/- 0.68 microgram/mL, respectively, just before bypass was stopped. When fresh heparinized human blood was recirculated within an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator bypass circuit for 120 minutes, plasma beta-TG rose to 5.13 micrograms/mL, lactoferrin increased from 0.13 +/- 0.04 to 1.62 +/- 0.22 micrograms/mL, and neutrophil elastase rose from 0.05 +/- 0.02 to 1.86 +/- 0.41 micrograms/mL. At 120 minutes, lidocaine (100 mumol/L), which inhibits neutrophil activation, delayed release of lactoferrin (1.33 +/- 0.26 micrograms/mL) and markedly inhibited release of elastase (0.24 +/- 0.05 microgram/mL) but did not inhibit release of beta-TG antigen (5.66 micrograms/mL at 120 minutes). PGE1 (0.3 mumol/L) inhibited significantly the release of beta-TG (0.31 microgram/mL) and elastase (0.52 +/- 0.11 microgram/mL) and attenuated the release of lactoferrin (1.57 +/- 0.45 micrograms/mL).\r"

We have directly mapped this viral protein to the pol gene of HTLV-III/LAV by radiolabeled amino acid sequence analysis. This region at the 3' end of the pol gene is predicted to encode the endonuclease/integrase of the virus. The seroprevalence rate of antibodies to the pol gene products p64 and p53 and to the endonuclease p34 were evaluated. Of 161 HTLV-III/LAV seropositive people tested by immunoblotting procedures, greater than 98% had antibodies which reacted to p64/p53 and 92.6% reacted to p34 indicating that these viral proteins are highly immunogenic in nature. We have also analyzed the serum of nine healthy people living in West Africa who were infected with HTLV-IV, a closely related retrovirus. Nine of nine seropositive people had antibodies that cross-reacted to p34 of HTLV-III/LAV, whereas only seven of nine reacted to p64/p53. These studies and our earlier observations indicate that current diagnostic procedures for screening for HTLV-III/LAV infection may also detect HTLV-IV seropositive individuals, pointing to a need for more specific assay systems.\r"

  ".W": "Diagnostic significance of serum immunoreactive elastase-1 was studied in 137 patients with pancreatic disease, 335 with various nonpancreatic diseases, and 416 healthy controls by using radioimmunoassay. Frequency of abnormally high serum elastase values exceeding 410 ng/dl was 100% in acute pancreatitis (N = 14), 40% in chronic pancreatitis (N = 80), and 72% in pancreatic cancer (N = 43). In pancreatic cancer the mean value of serum elastase in resectable cancer (N = 19) was significantly higher than that in unresectable cancer (N = 24). Sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of serum elastase in pancreatic cancer were 72.1%, 98.3%, and 95.9% against healthy controls; 72.1%, 85.9%, and 83.6% against nonpancreatic digestive diseases; and 72.1%, 60.0%, and 64.2% against chronic pancreatitis at a cutoff level of 410 ng/dl, respectively. High serum elastase could be a diagnostic clue to detect pancreatic duct obstruction due to pancreatic cancer, although further examination should be done by endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and other imaging studies.\r"

Findings of this study also suggest that proper patient selection may be of importance when using self-management or behavior modification techniques in asthma. Maximum profit from future use of PMR in the behavioral treatment of asthma might be achieved by identifying patients who are characterized as moderate or high in panic-fear. They will receive the greatest benefit from this treatment modality.\r"

Of these, 10 patients (12%) failed to complete therapy and were referred to the Chicago Board of Health.

Therefore, 67 patients (78%) successfully completed therapy. Our high rate of success is attributed to constant, high-intensity contact and consistent supervision of these potentially noncompliant patients.\r"

Future research is needed to identify stressors perceived by family members and to identify effective nursing interventions that would decrease familial stress and promote and maintain the family integrity during the hospitalization crisis. Future research should be time-sequenced to examine the effect of an intervention program as initial coping mechanisms begin to diminish. Finally, research is needed to determine whether family intervention alleviates stress in the stricken family member.\r"

PNH and normal platelets released factor H when C3 was bound to their surfaces. This may account for the apparent regulation of C3 convertase activity on platelets that lack DAF. The abnormal uptake of the membrane attack complex of complement by PNH III erythrocytes was not seen in PNH platelets. 111Indium-labeled platelet survival times were normal in five of eight patients, which suggests that the lack of the membrane attack complex defect results in normal platelet survival in PNH.\r"

We used as controls 26 children aged 6 to 7 years who had been born prematurely (mean birth weight 1636 +/- 554 g) but who had required no treatment for pulmonary disease. Results for total lung capacity, FEV1, ratios of functional residual capacity and residual volume to total lung capacity, specific airway conductance, and alveolar plateau slope did not differ in the RDS and control groups. Eight of the 18 children in the RDS group had had radiologic evidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 30 days and oxygen dependence at 30 days, but did not differ from the control group for any of the indices of pulmonary function. However, FEV1 and specific airway conductance were significantly reduced in the premature control group compared with children born at term. Therefore, factors associated with prematurity rather than combined effects of RDS and its treatment determined pulmonary function at age 6 to 9 years.\r"

No such difference was found among older persons. The lower survival was related to degree of hypercalcaemia, and this held true when systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum glucose, serum uric acid, and serum cholesterol were taken into account in a multivariate analysis. The lower survival seemed to be due mainly to deaths from diseases of the circulatory organs. No person with normal renal function at the beginning of the study period had a more than marginally raised serum creatinine at follow-up.\r"

After the infusion, serum and synovial-fluid iron-binding capacity became saturated, giving rise to low-molecular-mass iron chelates with the capacity to cause oxidative damage (\"bleomycin-iron\"). At the same time lipid peroxidation and the concentration of oxidised ascorbic acid (dehydroascorbate) increased in both serum and synovial fluid, and red-cell glutathione fell. These changes corresponded closely to an exacerbation of rheumatoid synovitis. Hepatic function was transiently disturbed 7 days after the infusion, reflecting hepatic oxidant stress within the iron-loaded liver. Such changes provide clear evidence that iron-catalysed oxidative reactions influence the inflammatory process in human beings.\r"

Approximately 50% of cases are associated with Chlamydia trachomatis infection in the genital tract, although conventional cultures of joint material are sterile. Synovium, synovial-fluid cells, or both, from eight patients with sexually acquired reactive arthritis (SARA) and eight with knee effusions associated with other rheumatic diseases were examined by means of a fluorescein-labelled monoclonal antibody to C trachomatis ('Micro Trak'; Syva). Typical chlamydial elementary bodies were seen in joint material from five patients with SARA but in none of the controls. An inclusion-like cluster of elementary bodies was seen in one synovial biopsy sample. All five patients had high titres of serum chlamydial antibody. It is likely that the synovitis of SARA results directly from the presence of chlamydial elementary bodies in the joint.\r"

Doctors had lower death rates from cardiovascular disease, tumours, other diseases, causes of death amenable to medical interventions, and accidents and violence, but not suicide. Except for tumours, mortality of male doctors was at the same level or higher than that of men in other professions. Risk of suicide was twice as high for male doctors as for other professions. The numbers of women doctors were too small for firm conclusions about their mortality to be drawn. It is concluded either that doctors do not use their professional knowledge and skills in a way that reduces their own mortality risk or that they are exposed to occupational hazards that cancel out such an effect. Possible hazards are more likely to be mental than physical or chemical.\r"

As judged by weight for age, 43% of children were adequately nourished and only 2% were severely malnourished. Stunting (less than 85% height for age) was seen in 8% and wasting (less than 70% weight for height) in 1%. There was poor agreement between MUAC (a measure of wasting) and weight for height when the conventional cut-off points for MUAC were applied. Although agreement improved with new MUAC cut-off points the probability of correct diagnosis of wasting (sensitivity) remained low. Although height for age and weight for height were the most useful measures of nutritional status, MUAC may be the best available in famine victims and refugees.\r"

The indications were: symptoms suggestive of gastro-oesophageal reflux but with normal endoscopy (19 cases); atypical chest pain with normal endoscopy (21 cases); or respiratory symptoms possibly due to reflux (13 cases). A temporal association between abnormal reflux and the presenting symptoms was demonstrated in 25 patients (47%). 6 patients were shown to have respiratory symptoms after episodes of reflux which resolved on treatment of the reflux alone. Reflux occurring only in the erect posture was observed in some patients and may have been a manifestation of the irritable bowel syndrome. Reflux as a cause of symptoms was excluded in 14 patients. The procedure was well tolerated in most patients, simple to operate, and inexpensive.\r"

  ".W": "Natural sheep surfactant, rabbit surfactant, human surfactant, and surfactant TA were compared for in vitro surface properties and for responses of preterm lambs to treatment. Equivalent amounts of sheep, rabbit, and human surfactants were needed to lower the surface tension to less than 10 dynes/cm, whereas four times less surfactant TA similarly lowered the surface tension. Surface-spreading rates were similar for the surfactants. The surface adsorption of the batch of human surfactant tested was much slower than was adsorption of the other surfactants. Ventilation was significantly improved in all surfactant-treated lambs relative to the control lambs, indicating the general efficacy of the surfactant treatments. Overall, surfactant TA had the best in vitro characteristics, yet the preterm lambs treated at birth with surfactant TA had lower PO2 values and higher ventilatory requirements than did the sheep surfactant-treated lambs. The in vivo responses to rabbit surfactant were intermediate between the responses to sheep surfactant and to surfactant TA. Human surfactant resulted in the least effective clinical response. More of the phosphatidylcholine associated with human surfactant and surfactant TA was lost from the alveoli and lung tissue after four hours of ventilation than was lost from sheep or rabbit surfactant-treated lambs. More intravascular radiolabeled albumin leaked into the alveoli of the surfactant TA-treated lambs than sheep or rabbit surfactant-treated lambs. The four surfactants also had different sensitivities to the effects on minimum surface tensions of the soluble proteins present in alveolar washes. The study demonstrates that the range of clinical responses was not predictable based on the in vitro surface properties that we measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

If the physician's office laboratory is subject to government regulations, be assured that the only objective is to provide assistance in accomplishing a mutual objective of quality work. The approach is one of a cooperative effort between professionals, and the physician's office laboratory should take advantage of the services, both consultation and training, offered by the regulatory agency. If the physician's office laboratory is not subject to regulations, the physician-director should personally direct the operation of his or her laboratory and keep abreast of the latest developments in laboratory medicine applicable to the specific areas of testing performed. The simplest way to do this is to take advantage of the voluntary certification programs being developed and any state or federal guidelines readily available.\r"

We have of necessity described this process very briefly, suggesting how specific tools may be derived for immediate use in the office laboratory. We conclude with a reminder that much useful information in the performance audit can be captured by constructing three tables with the following headings: 1. Job Description, Requirements, Standards; 2. Requirements, Standards, Deficiencies, Potential Impact; 3. Deficiencies, Possible Causes, Possible Solutions. Thus, the performance audit can provide useful information in regard to selecting personnel (item 1), monitoring the performance of laboratory personnel (item 2), and trouble-shooting specific problems (item 3).\r"

In particular, children under the age of 2 years may not express the illness clinically. Diagnostic criteria vary but in young adults usually include the symptoms of fever, exudative tonsillitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Usually, there is a relative and absolute lymphocytosis, with 10 to 20 per cent or greater atypical lymphocytes. Rapid slide tests are accurate and economical and support the diagnosis when positive. False-positive results are known to occur with several other important disease processes; therefore, the clinical presentation and laboratory results must be interpreted in their appropriate context. Quality control is essential even for the rapid slide tests, and experienced examiners are required to review blood smears. The morphology of atypical lymphocytes varies greatly. In addition, morphology interpretation can be hampered by problems in preparation of slides or the holding of blood samples awaiting slide preparation. EBV-specific serodiagnosis has significantly enhanced our ability to study further and differentiate heterophil-negative syndromes that share clinical features with infectious mononucleosis. Acute, past, chronic, and no EBV infection can now be differentiated. Further diagnostic tests for other etiologic agents are necessary when all EBV tests are negative and the clinical situation requires appropriate diagnosis.\r"

However, the studies in the literature supporting these uses have several methodologic problems that should make one cautious about relying on the test too heavily. Its use in the symptomatic patient should be secondary to a urinalysis, especially in those who as a group have significant sequelae from urinary tract infections. These include pregnant patients, diabetics, and geriatric patients who may be lacking signs and symptoms of infection. The dipstick is not meant as a replacement for the microscopic examination of the urine sediment; it should be used to direct one to examine urine specimens that would not normally be analyzed microscopically. Further studies controlling for symptoms and gender are needed to make the leukocyte esterase test more useful to the primary care physician.\r"

Blood glucose monitoring has allowed improved control of diabetic patients who avail themselves of one of the techniques. The physician choosing to offer blood glucose testing in the office laboratory has a variety of test equipment from which to choose. Most physicians will want to own and operate an inexpensive, dedicated glucose reflectometer to test glucose samples in the office and to use in patient education. Machines used by both patients and physicians are about the same price. They are easy to learn to use.

Sulbactam/ampicillin was synergistic against all strains (fractional bactericidal index, less than or equal to 0.10). Moreover, there was a linear relation in each group between the different concentrations of the two antibiotics required for bactericidal activity. Thus, an equation of bactericidal synergy could be formulated for the combination. The bactericidal activity of sulbactam/ampicillin was assessed against one strain of each group and against a reference strain (S. aureus ATCC 6538 P) in an in vitro model simulating the kinetics of both antibiotics in human blood after intravenous administration of 2 g of ampicillin and 1 g of sulbactam. The observed rate of killing was approximately 99% except with the MR2 strains, against which the combination was bacteriostatic.\r"

  ".W": "Three homosexual male patients with biopsy-proved Kaposi's sarcoma were classified as having the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) by Centers for Disease Control criteria when first seen in 1983 and 1984. These patients, however, differed from most patients with AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma in having normal CD4 cell numbers and normal CD4:CD8 ratio. Furthermore, these immunologic parameters remained normal for eight to 24 months of follow-up, and the disease did not progress. Results of recent testing of serum from these patients were negative for HTLV-III/LAV antibodies. The Kaposi's sarcoma was limited to skin (stage I tumors) and the patients did not have persistent lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. In contrast to AIDS, the serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM) and number of B cells that were spontaneously forming immunoglobulin were within normal range with no evidence of polyclonal activation. The lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin and Candida were reduced in two of the three patients, and skin test anergy was observed in the two patients tested. These findings are not frequently encountered in other healthy, homosexually active men or in classic Kaposi's sarcoma. They may be indicative of functional T cell changes (without numerical changes) induced by factors other than HTLV-III/LAV virus, which made these homosexually active men susceptible to development of low-grade Kaposi's sarcoma lesions.\r"

  ".W": "In situ hybridization with a 35S-labeled probe of cryosections from 14 lymph nodes of HTLV-III/LAV-seropositive individuals with lymphadenopathy showed the presence of rare cells containing HTLV-III RNA at levels consistent with virus replication. Positive cells were observed at a frequency of only 1-10 per section. In all lymph nodes studied, including those showing follicular hyperplasia or involution, most of the cells expressing viral RNA were present in the follicular areas. Only a minority of such cells were found outside the follicles. The nature of the follicular, virus-replicating cells was not evident from the processed cryosections. After prolonged autoradiography, another pattern of hybridization was observed, suggesting low levels of viral RNA diffusely distributed throughout most, but not all, follicles. This may represent extracellular virus and/or virus-antibody complexes, but was not consistent with intracellular viral RNA or phagocytosed virus particles. Comparison of hybridization levels in relation to histology suggested a decrease in both the number of HTLV-III replicating cells as well as in the diffusely distributed viral RNA with progression of follicular involution. Our observations indicate that in HTLV-III-infected subjects, lymph node follicles are an important site of virus replication and trapping, suggesting a decisive role of the virus in the characteristic reactive and cytopathogenic changes of HTLV-III-associated lymphadenopathy.\r"

  ".U": "87105279\r", 
  ".W": "We have detected tissue kallikrein and kallikrein mRNA in various brain regions with a kallikrein direct RIA and with nucleic acid hybridization using a kallikrein cDNA probe. In the direct RIA, rat urinary kallikrein-like activity was found in the pituitary and pineal glands, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain stem. Pituitary and pineal gland kallikrein concentrations were significantly higher than those in other regions. Only in pituitary was there a significant difference in tissue kallikrein concentration according to sex, with glands from female rats showing levels 4-fold higher than those from male rats. Kallikrein mRNAs were detected in all of the regions and were about 4-fold higher in female than in male pituitary gland. Northern blot analyses show sex dimorphism of pituitary kallikrein mRNA, similar in size to submandibular gland and kidney mRNA. In castrated male rats, whole pituitary kallikrein content was reduced to 50% of the control value and increased 1.7-fold with testosterone replacement and 18-fold with 17 beta-estradiol treatment. Neither T4 nor cortisol affected whole pituitary kallikrein levels in the castrated male rat, but testosterone decreased pituitary kallikrein in normal female rats by 35%. When anterior pituitary or neurointermediate lobe extracts were separately examined, immunoreactive kallikrein was 10.2- and 1.3-fold higher respectively, in female than in male rat lobes. Estradiol benzoate (30 micrograms/kg) administration increased kallikrein levels 90- and 22-fold, respectively, in the anterior pituitary of gonadectomized male and female rats, while it increased by only 40-50% kallikrein levels in the male and female neurointermediate lobe. In dot blot analysis, kallikrein mRNA levels were increased 5-fold by 17 beta-estradiol in the whole pituitary of castrated male rats. In the cytoplasmic dot hybridization analysis, estradiol benzoate treatment increased kallikrein mRNA levels 54-fold in the anterior pituitary of ovariectomized rats. The data show that a tissue kallikrein indistinguishable thus far from a urinary kallikrein is widely distributed in brain and pituitary and that levels of enzyme and mRNA are comparable in certain central sites. Kallikrein levels in the anterior and neurointermediate pituitaries are differentially regulated by estrogen.\r"

  ".W": "A permanent cell line (B-1-A-2) derived from an estrogen-responsive mouse Leydig cell tumor (T 124958-R) was established in culture. Although this cell line showed estrogen-induced enhancement of cell proliferation in vitro, a moderately high concentration (10(-8) M) of estradiol was required to stimulate maximum growth. A whole cell binding assay revealed that the B-1-A-2 cells contained estrogen receptors with relatively low affinity for estradiol (Kd, 10(-9)-10(-8) M). This estrogen receptor was found to have a mol wt of 65,000. In addition, incubation of the cells with [32P]orthophosphate and subsequent purification revealed that the estrogen receptor is phosphorylated. This finding prompted us to study the effect of phosphatase inhibitors on cell proliferation. The inclusion of vanadate (25 microM) in the culture medium resulted in a significant increase in estrogen sensitivity, showing a maximal growth stimulatory effect of estradiol at concentrations of 10(-10)-10(-9) M. Simultaneously, the conversion of the low affinity to the high affinity receptor (Kd, 10(-10)-10(-9) M) was induced by treatment of cells with vanadate. These data suggest that estrogen directly stimulates the growth of B-1-A-2 cells in culture, and that the sensitivity to estrogen can be altered by modulating the estrogen receptor possibly via a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of antibodies to HTLV-III and markers of active hepatitis B virus replication was examined in a longitudinal study of 33 consecutive male homosexual HBsAg carriers. The mean follow-up time was 37 months (range = 4 to 109 months). All patients were initially hepatitis B virus DNA-positive and HBeAg positive. Antibodies to HTLV-III were detectable in eight patients while they were positive for both of these markers. One of them cleared hepatitis B virus DNA and seroconverted from HBeAg to anti-HBe. This corresponds to an annual clearance/seroconversion rate of 4% (95% confidence limits = 0 to 15%). In two patients, antibodies to HTLV-III appeared after clearance of hepatitis B virus DNA and HBeAg, and in one of them, hepatitis B virus DNA reappeared. Among the 25 patients negative for HTLV-III antibodies, the annual hepatitis B virus DNA clearance rate was 20% and HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion rate was 11% (95% confidence limits = 11 to 31% and 4 to 20% respectively). The observed hepatitis B virus DNA clearance rates in the two groups were significantly different (p less than 0.05). Disease activity, as determined by transaminase levels, was significantly lower in HTLV-III-infected individuals as compared to individuals without HTLV-III infection (p less than 0.05). Infection with HTLV-III may extend the period of active viral replication or even reactivate hepatitis B virus replication and seems to diminish inflammatory disease activity in chronic HBsAg carriers.\r"

  ".W": "Addition of glucose oxidase (GO) increased H2O2 concentrations and decreased antielastolytic activities of beta-D-glucose containing perfusates of isolated rat lungs. Pretreatment with GO also caused acute edematous injury (increased lung weight gains, increased recovery of Ficoll in lung lavages, and increased pulmonary arterial pressures) in isolated lungs perfused with purified human neutrophil elastase (NE). Acute edematous injury in isolated lungs pretreated with GO and then NE exceeded levels found in lungs following addition of GO or NE alone or NE before GO. Simultaneous addition of catalase (an H2O2 scavenger) or methoxy-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-prolyl-L-valine-chloromethyl ketone (an NE inhibitor, but not aminotriazole-inactivated catalase, N-tosyl-L-phenyl-alanine chloromethyl ketone (a chymotrypsin inhibitor) or N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (a trypsin inhibitor), prevented acute edematous injury in isolated lungs perfused with both GO and NE. This observation indicated that injury was dependent on both H2O2 and NE, especially since the relative inactivating specificities of the inhibitors for H2O2 or NE, respectively, were confirmed under similar conditions in vitro. The synergistic nature of the interaction between H2O2 and NE-mediated injury was further clarified when GO- and NE-induced lung injury was prevented by addition of an oxidant-resistant NE inhibitor (Eglin-C), but not an oxidant-sensitive NE inhibitor (human alpha 1-protease inhibitor, alpha 1PI). Moreover, treatment with H2O2 also decreased the ability of alpha 1PI but not Eglin-C to decrease NE activity in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two Mab, HA4-1B (gamma 2a kappa) and HA4-15 (gamma 2a kappa), reacted with the same or adjacent epitopes on the Bb fragment of B, while the other two, HA4-1A (gamma 1 kappa) and FD3-20 (gamma 1 kappa), reacted with distinct epitopes on Ba. All reactive epitopes were expressed on native B and only one, recognized by the anti-Ba Mab HA4-1A was more reactive on isolated Ba than on B. These binding specificities were determined by direct binding radioassays and confirmed by inhibition studies. Immunoelectron microscopy of B and Bb in complex with anti-Ba and anti-Bb revealed that the recognized epitopes are on opposite sides of the molecule and are on discrete domains. All four Mab inhibited the hemolytic activity of B, although with different efficiencies and through different mechanisms. The main effect of the two anti-Bb Mab was an increased rate of loss of hemolytic sites from preformed EC3bBb C3 convertase presumably through accelerated dissociation of Bb. On the other hand, the main effect of the two anti-Ba Mab was inhibition of binding of B to C3b. HA4-1A was more efficient, inhibiting by 50% the binding of [125I]B to EC3b at 10 micrograms/ml as IgG and at 13 micrograms/ml as Fab. The data suggest that a binding site for C3b on intact B is located on the Ba portion of the molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Human leukocyte inhibitory factor (LIF) is a lymphokine initially defined by its ability to inhibit the random migration of neutrophils. We have recently demonstrated that LIF also potentiates a number of f-met-leu-phe-mediated functions as well as enhancing one Fc receptor-mediated function (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity). In this paper, we have extended our studies involving the effects of LIF on the neutrophil, specifically its effect on phagocytosis and bactericidal activity. We demonstrate that LIF (2 U/ml) potentiates phagocytosis of opsonized heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (up to 57.2%) and sheep erythrocytes (124.4%) as well as unopsonized latex particles (59.9%). Phagocytosis of opsonized sheep erythrocytes was inhibited by an anti-neutrophil Fc receptor antibody with control PMN but not using the LIF-treated PMN. LIF (1/2 to 1 U) also potentiates the killing of S. aureus by up to 51.6%. Higher concentrations of LIF (greater than or equal to 4 U) inhibits killing. These effects were shown not to be associated with an increase in Fc receptor availability. It is therefore possible that potentiation of these neutrophil activities by LIF may occur either as a result of increased receptor turnover or, more likely, secondary to an increase in nonspecific neutrophil adherence. These studies further support the concept that LIF may have an important role in vivo in inflammation and immunity.\r"
