An absence of end-diastolic velocities had a strong statistical association with hypoxia and acidosis, and was an accurate clinical test for hypoxia (sensitivity 78%, specificity 98%, positive predictive value 88%, and negative predictive value 98%) and acidosis (sensitivity 90%, specificity 92%, positive predictive value 53%, and negative predictive value 100%). It was also a clinically sensitive indicator of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Most fetuses with no end-diastolic velocities were growth-retarded, but the reverse was not true. The absence of end-diastolic velocities also divided both mature and immature fetuses into high- and low-risk groups for hypoxia and acidosis. In the presence of end-diastolic velocities, only very high S/D ratios (above 4.5) have any association with hypoxia. As a noninvasive test of fetal umbilical vein pO2 and pH, umbilical artery Doppler performs well.\r"

Traditional methods of in utero fetal evaluation have been unsuccessful in reliably distinguishing oligohydramnios with normal outcome from that associated with increased perinatal morbidity. A prospective study was undertaken to establish the predictive value of Doppler velocimetry in identifying the fetus with oligohydramnios at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome. Twenty-two gravid women with subjective oligohydramnios on ultrasound had continuous-wave umbilical artery velocimetry. Subjects were divided into two groups based on the results of Doppler analysis. Group 1 (N = 13) had normal umbilical Doppler waveforms. In this group, 12 of 13 patients had normal perinatal outcome, defined by the absence of intrapartum fetal distress or evidence of intrauterine growth retardation. Group 2 consisted of nine subjects with abnormal waveforms. Perinatal morbidity occurred in 100% in this group. We conclude that an abnormal umbilical artery waveform may provide confirmatory evidence of impending fetal compromise when the antenatal sonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios is made.\r"

Ultrasound examination within a month of testing showed no increases in nuchal cord localization or decreased amniotic fluid volumes in a subgroup of 181 patients. Fetuses with antepartum variable decelerations were more likely to demonstrate similar decelerations in labor (P less than .001), to undergo operative delivery for a diagnosis of \"distress\" (P less than .05), to require intensive care nursery admission (P less than .01), and to be small for gestational age (P less than .01). No significant differences were noted in frequency of nuchal or other cord entanglements, overall cesarean section rate, or low pH or Apgar score values. We conclude that variable decelerations in the absence of other alarming NST findings may aid in identifying patients at risk for adverse perinatal occurrences, although factors other than nuchal cord placement or oligohydramnios may be responsible.\r"

  ".W": "By the use of a vaginal scanner and simultaneous pressure-flow measurements, we developed a new method to study bladder and urethral function. During urodynamic pressure measurements, a vaginal scanner was positioned adjacent to the vulva just underneath the external urethral orifice to scan the bladder, the vesicourethral junction, and the urethra. This technique was termed \"introital sonography.\" Twenty patients with the symptom of \"loss of urine\" and ten healthy volunteers without urinary symptoms were studied. Introital sonography displayed the bladder, the urethra, and the symphysis in all women. No incontinence was demonstrable in the healthy control group. Opening of the bladder neck was always visible during micturition, and a normal flow pattern could be observed in all healthy women. In five patients with detrusor instability, opening of the bladder neck was found during cystometry, displaying isolated detrusor contractions. Fifteen patients with genuine stress incontinence demonstrated marked descent of the vesicourethral junction under stressful situations. For the diagnosis of detrusor instability, sonographic visualization of bladder neck opening confirms the entity of isolated detrusor contractions during cystometry and thus helps to exclude tonometric artifacts. Introital sonography not only confirms the diagnosis of genuine stress incontinence by accurately demonstrating the abnormal vesicourethral anatomy, but also provides information that is essential for selecting the proper operative procedure. The lack of radiation exposure and contrast medium makes this inexpensive technique most useful for long-term video pressure-flow studies in patients with bladder dysfunction.\r"

Ten days postpartum, she presented with severe hypertension followed by cardiac arrest. Subsequent coronary catheterization revealed no evidence of coronary atherosclerosis but showed a 60-70% stenotic plaque in the left anterior descending artery, possibly secondary to coronary artery spasm. A review of all previously reported cases of postpartum myocardial infarction is presented in an effort to identify the possible etiology of this event and to consider the role of bromocriptine. The most common associated finding in all cases was a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, which may have been associated with a predisposition to coronary vasospasm.

These studies, performed at 29 weeks' gestation, demonstrated markedly different umbilical artery systolic to end-diastolic (S/D) ratios in the twins. This difference is explained by the vascular resistance reflected in the umbilical artery S/D ratios obtained on each twin. The healthy twin's S/D ratio represented the vascular resistance of the placenta and the perfused acardiac twin. Because of the reversed direction of blood flow in the acardiac twin's umbilical artery, this S/D ratio represented the vascular resistance of the acardiac twin. Planned preterm delivery resulted in survival of the healthy normal twin.\r"

In the remaining patient, the posterior vaginal wall had ruptured distal to the attachment of mesh to the vagina. In each patient, the mesh had become completely interpenetrated by tissue. We believe that failures can be minimized by suturing the suspensory mesh to the vagina over as extended an area as possible. Reasons for this belief are addressed, and techniques for achieving such an attachment are described. A meticulous culdoplasty beneath the suspensory mesh is also considered important, as is the use of permanent sutures placed through the full thickness of the vagina in attaching the mesh.\r"

This review pools data from perinatal center reports to update mortality and morbidity trends for each subgroup of very low birth weight infants. Throughout the last 10 years, there has been steady and statistically significant improvement in neonatal mortality rates among inborn very low weight infants (1500 g or less). The most substantial improvement of the 1980s over the late 1970s is in the 750-1000-g birth weight group, in which today's infants have about a 70% chance of surviving if they have access to neonatal intensive care. Mortality in infants born weighing less than 750 g is still very high; overall about two-thirds die, but results are highly variable across centers, with several centers reporting 50-70% survival. The rate of serious long-term disability increases with decreasing birth weight, but within each birth weight group, the proportion of survivors who have serious handicaps has not changed significantly since the introduction of neonatal intensive care. For infants born between 1975-1985, 26% of surviving infants with birth weights below 800 g, 17% of survivors with birth weights between 750-1000 g, and 11% of survivors with birth weights between 1000-1500 g have major handicaps at 1 or 2 years of age. Because many very sick newborns who previously would have died are now surviving, an increasing rate of handicap might have been expected.\r"

Oximeters measure the different absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Electronic measures of oxygenation at the peak of the pulse allow computation and display of oxygen saturation of the arterial blood almost instantly. Correlation coefficients between pulse oximetry and direct blood oxygen saturation measurement range from 0.77-0.99 when oxygen saturation is greater than 60%. The method is noninvasive (a clip or tape on a finger), simple to operate, and adaptable to various patient populations. Pulse oximetry monitors continuously and instantaneously, is responsive to change, and is accurate. Factors adversely affecting the accuracy of pulse oximeter output include transducer movement, peripheral vasoconstriction, a nonpulsating vascular bed, hypotension, anemia, changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypothermia, presence of intravascular dyes, and nail polish. Pulse oximetry has been used to monitor oxygen saturation intraoperatively in the adult and neonatal intensive care units and to monitor pregnant patients and their infants at delivery. Once the advantages and limitations of pulse oximetry are recognized, this monitoring technique can play an important role in the care of patients with cardiovascular and respiratory compromise.\r"

Our findings indeed point to the fact that the keratocytes are the primary source of the opacities as is the case in the granular dystrophy. From the clinical, biomicroscopic and light-microscopic differences, however, it seems likely that both dystrophies will in future be shown to be due to different biochemical defects or that they are at least allelic forms of the same biochemical defect.\r"

  ".W": "Since many receptors apparently contain only one or two membrane-spanning segments, their transmembrane topology should be similar. This feature suggests that these receptors share common mechanisms of transmembrane signaling. To test the degree of conservation of signaling properties, a chimeric receptor containing the ligand-binding extracellular domain of the Escherichia coli aspartate chemoreceptor and the cytosolic portion of the human insulin receptor was constructed. This chimeric receptor is active as a tyrosine kinase, and aspartate stimulates its activity. Some interesting differences are noted in the target proteins phosphorylated by the chimera compared to the wild-type insulin receptor. These results indicate that features of the signaling mechanisms used by these diverse receptors are conserved, but that interesting changes in the protein properties are caused by differences in the neighboring domains.\r"

The protein encoded consists of 1692 amino acids and has adenylate cyclase activity that cannot be activated by the Sa. cerevisiae RAS2 protein. Sc. pombe cyclase has a high degree of homology (approximately 60%) with the catalytic domain of Sa. cerevisiae cyclase precisely mapped by a gene-deletion analysis. A 25-40% identity is observed throughout the middle segments of approximately 1000 residues of both cyclases, large parts of which are composed of repetitions of a 23-amino acid motif similar to those found in human glycoproteins, Drosophila chaoptin, and Toll gene product. However, a segment corresponding to the NH2-terminal 620 residues of Sa. cerevisiae cyclase appears lost from Sc. pombe cyclase, and the COOH-terminal 140 residues are not well conserved between the two yeast species. Deletions involving the COOH-terminal residues of Sa. cerevisiae cyclase cause loss of activation by the RAS2 protein. These results suggest that Sc. pombe cyclase may have lost the ability to interact with RAS proteins by the loss of a regulatory site.\r"

We show that radiolabeled STE12 protein, prepared by in vitro transcription and translation, is capable of forming complexes with unlabeled DNA fragments from two a-specific genes. Wild-type yeast, but not a ste12 mutant, produce a factor that forms complexes with labeled DNA from these same two genes. We use assays with yeast extracts to localize the binding site for the STE12-dependent activity. This site corresponds to the sequence identified as the pheromone induction element, which is responsible for increased transcription of genes when cells are exposed to alpha-factor or a-factor. Thus the STE12 protein may be an ultimate effector in the signal transduction pathway triggered by pheromone.\r"

TFIID binding is highly specific and recognizes nonspecific sites with approximately 10(5)-fold lower affinity. Despite this specificity, TFIID also binds with high affinity to several TATA elements that do not match the consensus TATA sequences (TATAAA and TATATA): the yeast LEU2 TATA (TATTATTTA), the simian virus 40 TATA (CTTATTTAT), and the yeast CYC1 -10 TATA (TTATACATT) all bound TFIID. Furthermore, TFIID was active in promoting transcription in vitro from the nonconsensus TATA elements.

  ".W": "Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is a 37-amino acid peptide found in the pancreatic amyloid deposits of type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients and insulinomas. We previously reported the nucleotide sequence of a human cDNA, which indicated that IAPP is a C-terminally amidated peptide derived by proteolytic processing of an 89-amino acid precursor. We now report the isolation of cDNA clones coding for cat, rat, mouse, and guinea pig IAPP precursors, obtained using the combination of \"amplification of homologous DNA fragments\" (AHF) and \"rapid amplification of cDNA ends\" (RACE). The predicted structure of IAPP precursors from these four mammals revealed that the IAPP moiety of each is derived from an 89- to 93-amino acid precursor by proteolytic processing and is likely to be amidated at the C terminus. The predicted amino acid sequence identities between the IAPP domains of these four mammals and human IAPP were 89% (cat), 84% (rat and mouse), and 78% (guinea pig). Within the IAPP domains, the N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequences are very highly conserved among the mammals, as is also the case with a structurally related neuropeptide, calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), suggesting that IAPP and CGRP interact with similar though not identical receptors. By contrast, the N- and C-terminal propeptides of the IAPP precursor show very little sequence conservation, which suggests that these regions do not represent additional biologically active molecules. Interspecies variations in the amino acid sequence of residues 20-29 of IAPP may account for the presence of amyloid deposits in the islets of humans and cats and their absence in rats and mice.\r"

In addition to the DNA-binding domain, which is located near the N terminus, an adjacent region (the transcriptional activation domain) containing about 80 amino acids was found to be essential for transcriptional activation. Deletion of a region spanning about 175 amino acids of the C-proximal portion increased transcriptional activation markedly, revealing that this domain normally represses activation. Differences between the transcriptional activation and repression functions of c-Myb and v-Myb are discussed in the light of these functional domains. Our results suggest that transcriptional activation may be involved in transformation by myb gene products.\r"

Here we describe the isolation of cDNA clones containing the complete coding region of the Xenopus laevis homolog of c-mos (mosxe). The mosxe gene is transforming when introduced into murine NIH 3T3 cells, and transformation is abrogated by a lysine-to-arginine mutation in the canonical ATP-binding site. Microinjection of in vitro transcribed mosxe RNA into prophase-arrested Xenopus oocytes causes a resumption of meiosis, leading to germinal vesicle breakdown and oocyte maturation. Oocyte maturation was not observed after microinjection of in vitro transcribed mosxe RNA encoding the lysine-to-arginine mutation. These results demonstrate that the mosxe-encoded protein can induce progression through the cell cycle for both meiotic and mitotic cells and that this property is dependent on the presumptive ATP-binding domain in the protein kinase.\r"

Highly purified scatter factor has been obtained by a combination of ion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography from serum-free medium conditioned by a ras-transformed clone (D4) of mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Under nonreducing conditions scatter factor has a pI of approximately 9.5 and migrates in SDS/polyacrylamide gels as a single band at approximately 62 kDa from which epithelial scatter activity can be recovered. Treatment with reducing agents destroys biological activity and is associated with the appearance of two major bands at approximately 57 and approximately 30 kDa. Whether both the 57-kDa and 30-kDa polypeptides are required for biological activity remains to be established. All the activities observed in crude medium conditioned by cells producing scatter factor are retained by highly purified preparations of scatter factor. These include (i) increased local movement, modulation of morphology, and inhibition of junction formation by single epithelial cells and (ii) disruption of epithelial interactions and cell scattering from preformed epithelial sheets. These changes occur with picomolar concentrations of purified scatter factor and without an effect on cell growth.\r"

To achieve adequate sensitivity and localize spatially the receptors in younger embryos, we adapted an autoradiographic technique using whole-mounted chicken blastoderms. Insulin receptors and IGF-I receptors were expressed and could be localized as early as gastrulation, before the first somite is formed. Relative density was analyzed by a computer-assisted image system, revealing overall slightly higher binding of IGF-I than of insulin. Structures rich in both types of receptors were predominantly of ectodermal origin: Hensen's node in gastrulating embryos and neural folds, neural tube and optic vesicles during neurulation. The signal transduction capability of the receptors in early organogenesis was assessed by their ability to phosphorylate the exogenous substrate poly(Glu80Tyr20). Ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrable with both insulin and IGF-I in glycoprotein-enriched preparations from embryos at days 2 through 6 of embryogenesis. There was a developmentally regulated change in ligand-dependent tyrosine kinase activity, with a sharp increase from day 2 to day 4, in contrast with a small increase in the ligand binding. Binding of 125I-labeled IGF-I was, with the solubilized receptors, severalfold higher than binding of 125I-labeled insulin. However, the insulin-dependent phosphorylation was as high as the IGF-I-dependent phosphorylation at each developmental stage.\r"

This method permits direct replica plating and processing of colonies from the primary transformation plate to nitrocellulose filters.

In these animal models, a single injection of a low dose of human recombinant IL-1 normalized glucose blood levels for several hours. This effect was not mediated by possible insulin secretagogue actions of the cytokine. Furthermore, IL-1 markedly reduced the levels of triglycerides in blood of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice at later stages of the disease. Although the final mechanism of action is at present unknown, the results showed that IL-1 is a hormone with powerful antidiabetic properties. Defective production of this cytokine associated with diabetes could contribute to aggravate the course of the disease during infectious and inflammatory processes.\r"

In this report, using a 125I-labeled monospecific antibody against the 27-kDa protein, we measured changes in the 27-kDa protector protein in response to changes in oxidative stress and heat shock. With a shift from an anaerobic (95% N2/5% CO2) to a hyperaerobic (95% O2/5% CO2) atmosphere, a 3-fold increase was observed. This increase was prevented by cycloheximide, indicating that the induction requires new protein synthesis. The antioxidant protein synthesis was also significantly enhanced by the addition of either 2-mercaptoethanol or Fe3+ to the growth medium. Radioimmunoassay results also show that the antioxidant protein is an abundant protein, as it constitutes 0.7% of total soluble protein from yeast grown aerobically. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that rat tissues also contain a 27-kDa protein that can be specifically recognized by antibodies against the yeast protein. These results suggest that in vivo induction in yeast of the 27-kDa protein may represent an adaptive response that evolved to protect cells against damage caused by thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation systems, and the antioxidant protein is conserved in mammalian tissues. A heat shock applied to yeast did not cause any significant increases in the concentration of the 27-kDa protein.\r"

Searches of the current protein banks also have revealed a high degree of sequence similarity of the lysyl-tRNA synthetase to the product of the Escherichia coli herC gene and to the partial sequence of a protein encoded by an unidentified reading frame located adjacent to the E. coli frdA gene. Based on the sequence similarities and the map positions of the herC and frdA loci, we propose herC to be the structural gene of the constitutively expressed lysyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli and the unidentified reading frame to be the structural gene of the heat-inducible lysyl-tRNA synthetase.\r"

To clarify whether Tif is involved in translation, we produced an affinity-purified anti-Tif antibody by using Tif isolated from a Tif-overproducing yeast strain as immunogen and an Escherichia coli strain expressing Tif from an expression vector to provide the extract for affinity purification of the antibody. By using chromatographic procedures and the affinity-purified anti-Tif antibody as probe to identify Tif-containing fractions, we purified Tif from wild-type yeast cells. When yeast cells containing the only TIF1 gene on a plasmid under the control of the galactose-inducible CYC1-GAL10 promoter were grown in medium containing glucose as the carbon source, the production of Tif was shut off and growth was arrested. Lysates made from these cells were inactive in in vitro translation. Addition of Tif to these lysates restored in vitro protein synthesis. These results show that Tif is a translation factor, the yeast homologue of mammalian translation initiation factor 4A.\r"

  ".W": "EnvZ and OmpR, the regulatory proteins for ompF and ompC expression in Escherichia coli, belong to a modulator-effector family of regulatory proteins which are essential for the response to environmental signals. We show that the soluble cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane modulator protein EnvZ is phosphorylated in vitro by [gamma-32P]-ATP. We also demonstrate that the phosphate group can, in turn, be transferred to the transcription activator protein OmpR. The pH stability properties of the phosphate groups linked to EnvZ indicate that this molecule contains histidyl phosphate. The invariant His-243 of EnvZ corresponds to the phosphorylated His-48 of the chemotactic modulator protein CheA. Substitution of His-243 with valine produces an EnvZ that is refractory to phosphorylation and can no longer catalyze the transfer of phosphate to OmpR. Furthermore, in a delta envZ strain of E. coli, containing the envZ Val-243 plasmid, ompC expression is elevated 7-fold relative to that found in cells carrying the wild-type envZ plasmid. Based on these results we propose a model in which the phosphorylated state of OmpR modulates the expression of the ompF and ompC genes.\r"

Knotting, however, makes inverted site substrates equally efficient. The structure of the knotted products of recombination shows that the DNA wrapped around resolvase in the synaptic intermediate has the same local geometry as the standard substrate but is reversed in topological sign. Similarly, the same strand exchange with the two substrates generates supercoils with opposite signs. Thus, DNA geometry rather than topology is critical for these features of recombination. The knotted inverse substrate like the direct site substrate must be (-) supercoiled under standard reaction conditions. However, under conditions in which supercoiling is not required, the structure of the knotted product is apparently the same. This indicates that the unique direction of strand exchange is determined by the structure of the synaptosome and not by (-) supercoiling of the substrate.\r"

Soluble permease is dissociated from membranes with urea or other chaotropes and appears after the membrane is saturated with newly synthesized permease. Remarkably, this form of the permease appears to remain soluble in phosphate buffer at neutral pH after removal of urea, although it aggregates in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, soluble permease behaves as a monomer during size-exclusion chromatography with or without urea, contains less than 3 mol of organic phosphate per mol of protein, and is largely helical. Soluble permease binds p-nitrophenyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside approximately 40% as well as permease in the native environment of the membrane and can be reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles that catalyze lactose counterflow or active transport in response to a membrane potential (interior negative). The results suggest that lac permease can assume a nondenatured conformation in aqueous solution.\r"

Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I could not substitute for eubacterial DNA topoisomerase 1 in this reaction. Furthermore, the addition of eukaryotic topoisomerase I to a preincubated reaction mixture containing both T antigen and eubacterial topoisomerase I caused rapid relaxation of the positively supercoiled DNA. These results suggest that SV40 T antigen can introduce topoisomerase-relaxable supercoils into DNA in a reaction coupled to ATP hydrolysis. We interpret the observed T antigen supercoiling reaction in terms of a recently proposed twin-supercoiled-domain model that describes the mechanics of DNA helix-tracking processes. According to this model positive and negative supercoils are generated ahead of and behind the moving SV40 T antigen, respectively. The preferential relaxation of negative supercoils by eubacterial DNA topoisomerase I explains the accumulation of positive supercoils in the DNA template. The supercoiling assay using DNA conformation-specific eubacterial DNA topoisomerase I may be of general use for the detection of ATP-dependent DNA helix-tracking proteins.\r"

Nucleation of this second polymorph is first disclosed by diffuse streaks in electron diffraction patterns or in computer-generated Fourier transforms of electron microscope images. With time, this streaking is resolved as an apparent superlattice, and eventually domains of orthorhombic polymorph are detected in the parent hexagonal lattice that can be oriented in either of three directions, depending on the polarity of the orthorhombic crystal growth. Models for this phenomenon based on protein trimer rotation successfully explain the progress of the phase transition and, if protein-protein interactions are the most important interactions between adjacent trimers in the lipid matrix, the transition is quite similar to what occurs with molecular crystals.\r"

In situ hybridization revealed CCK mRNA-expressing cells in the peripheral parts of the seminiferous tubules. Biochemical identification showed that the majority of prepro-CCK products in the testis represented pro-CCK. Immunofluorescence studies revealed CCK-like peptides primarily in spermatocytes and spermatids of mouse, rat, and monkey. Immuno electron microscopy of monkey testis demonstrated CCK immunoreactivity in the acrosomal granule of spermatids. Hence, an interesting possibility is that CCK peptides can be released during the acrosome reaction and thus may be of importance in the fertilization process.\r"

Membrane vesicles of RM or InV were fused to a planar lipid bilayer that was formed in a hole of a partition separating two chambers. Fusion of a single RM vesicle yielded a single-step conductance increase. Some preparations yielded unitary conductances of 20, 55, 80, and 115 pS in 45 mM potassium glutamate. These channels were largely open at negative membrane potential on the cytoplasmic side of the RM membrane, mostly closed at positive voltages, permeable to amino acids, and slightly more selective for anions than cations. There was a dramatic increase in the number of open channels when 100 microM GTP was added to the cytoplasmic side of the fused RM, whereas 100 microM guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate caused closing of channels. ATP had no effect. A large channel of 115 pS at 45 mM potassium glutamate was also detected after the fusion of InV. As both RM and InV share the ability to translocate secretory proteins, it is possible that the 115-pS channel in both membranes represents a protein-conducting channel.\r"

  ".U": "89345627\r", 
  ".W": "We have hypothesized that oligodendrocyte (OL) surface glycolipids, specifically galactocerebroside and sulfatide, play a role in the regulation of OL development by acting as sensors/transmitters of environment information. In support of this hypothesis we report here a reversible inhibition of OL progenitor cell differentiation by a monoclonal antibody [Ranscht mAb (R-mAb); Ranscht, B., Clapshaw, P. A. & Seifert, W. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 2709-2713] that reacts with these glycolipids. When isolated OL progenitors or mixed primary cultures are grown in the presence of the antibody, myelinogenic development is blocked in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations as low as 2 micrograms of IgG per ml. The inhibited cells express the OL progenitor markers O4 and vimentin but are negative for galactosylcerebroside, sulfatide, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase, myelin basic protein, and myelin basic protein RNA expression. In contrast, the levels of total cellular protein and the expression of astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein in mixed cultures are not affected. Antibody-blocked cells have a distinctive morphology in which long, sparsely branched processes emanate from round cell bodies. Upon removing the perturbing antibody, the cells rapidly resume differentiation. Reverted mixed primary cultures, in which OL progenitors of several sequential developmental stages are present at the time of plating, differentiate more rapidly than control cultures, suggesting that the antibody-induced block results in a synchronization of developmental progression along the OL lineage by accumulating cells at the inhibition point. However, the normal temporal sequence of marker expression is maintained. Control studies with several other antibodies recognizing OL cell surface antigens, including HNK-1, neural cellular adhesion molecule (N-CAM), 1A9, anticholesterol, and O1, did not inhibit development. Since the inhibition occurs in highly enriched populations of OL progenitors, the inhibition does not involve cell-cell interactions between OLs and other cell types but concerns interactions of OLs with themselves, soluble factors, or OL extracellular matrix molecules and adhesion factors that provide essential environmental signals required for normal myelinogenic development.\r"

The Bs1 element is 3203 base pairs (bp) in length, has 302-bp identical long terminal direct repeats (LTRs), and created a 5-bp flanking direct duplication of target Adh1 DNA upon insertion. The 5' LTR is followed by a canonical primer binding site with homology to the plant initiator methionyl-tRNA, and the 3' LTR is directly preceded by a polypurine stretch like that observed in retroviruses and retrotransposons. Bs1 encodes two overlapping open reading frames specifying peptides of 740 and 168 amino acids. The longer open reading frame specifies a peptide with amino acid homology to the protease and nucleic acid binding moiety of retroviruses and retrotransposons. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by Bs1 lacks convincing homology to the polymerase (reverse transcriptase) encoded by retroposons, despite the fact that this polymerase-encoding domain is routinely the most conserved region of any such element. The sequence and relatively small size of Bs1 suggest that this element is a deleted retrotransposon that inserted into Adh1 with the aid of a reverse transcriptase function provided in trans. In vitro transcribed Bs1 complementary RNA was translated in vitro to produce both a protein of 81 kDa representing open reading frame 1 (ORF1) and one of the 95-kDa size predicted for the frame-shifted fusion of ORF1 and ORF2. As with many other retroposons, the efficiency of translational initiation at the AUG beginning ORF1 was not noticeably affected by the presence of one or more upstream, unproductive AUGs in the complementary RNA transcript.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were carried out in the skin of patients with leprosy to examine whether suppressor cell populations either exist in the skin of multibacillary lepromatous leprosy patients, can be activated with antigen, or are induced to emigrate into a cutaneous site from the circulation. For this purpose, purified protein derivative of tuberculin, a delayed-type antigen that generates a cell-mediated immune response, was introduced into the skin alone or with nonviable Mycobacterium leprae bacilli. Areas of induration and the resulting numbers and phenotypes of emigratory cells were not influenced by M. leprae and its products. Further studies examined the ability of M. leprae and its soluble products to modify the cutaneous response to intradermal injection of recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), a lymphokine that mimics a cell-mediated response. Neither the simultaneous injection of M. leprae and IL-2, nor the prior injection of M. leprae followed in 2 days by IL-2, nor the prior administration of IL-2 followed in 4 days by M. leprae, into the same skin site, modified the zone of induration generated by IL-2. In addition, the immunocytochemical and histopathological evaluation of biopsy specimens of skin sites showed no difference between sites injected with IL-2 and sites injected with IL-2 and M. leprae. We conclude that suppressor T cells, if they exist, do not influence the gross or microscopic responsiveness of a cell-mediated skin reaction to antigen and IL-2. IL-2 did, however, enhance the responsiveness of skin-test-positive tuberculoid patients and family contacts to M. leprae antigens by a synergistic effect on the zone of induration and local cell accumulation.\r"

All seven strains of mice were capable of producing gp195-specific antibodies. Generalized immune recognition of gp195 by mice of diverse H-2 haplotypes distinguished gp195 from the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein and the 230-kDa and 48/45-kDa gamete surface antigens. However, the H-2 genetic locus appeared to influence the specificity of gp195-specific antibodies. Immunoblot patterns of mouse sera with parasite antigens revealed a complex pattern of reactivity with terminal and intermediate processing fragments of gp195. The majority of immunoblot bands observed were similar for all of the mouse strains; however, there were several strains that additionally recognized a few unique fragments or displayed more intense reactivities with specific processing fragments. These results suggest that while individuals of diverse major histocompatibility complex makeup are capable of recognizing the gp195 antigen, the recognition of specific gp195 B-cell and T-cell epitopes may be under control of the major histocompatibility complex.\r"

Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated astrocytes produced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis using a mouse TNF probe and by functional assay. Biological activity of rat astrocyte-derived TNF was neutralized by rabbit antiserum against recombinant murine TNF. Stimulation of astrocytes by lipopolysaccharide also activated the interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 genes. We have also investigated whether a neurotropic paramyxovirus, Newcastle disease virus, triggers cytokine production by astrocytes. This virus induced astrocytes to produce TNF, lymphotoxin, interleukin 6, and alpha- and beta-interferons. Thus, stimulation by endotoxin and virus activated distinct, yet overlapping, sets of cytokine genes. We propose that astrocytes and the cytokines they produce may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of immunologically and/or virally mediated CNS disease, in CNS intercellular communication, and in the interactions between the nervous and immune systems.\r"

  ".W": "Psoriasis is a common papulosquamous skin disease. The histopathology is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation. Recent studies suggest that keratinocyte proliferation and inflammation in psoriasis are manifestations of the same underlying pathological process. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a cytokine that is a major mediator of the host response to tissue injury and infection, is produced by both keratinocytes and leukocytes in culture. IL-6 expression was studied in psoriatic plaques by immunoperoxidase staining with two different polyclonal anti-recombinant IL-6 antisera and by in situ nucleic acid hybridization with IL-6 cRNA probes. Epidermal and dermal cells in active psoriatic plaques from 35 psoriasis patients stained heavily for IL-6 as compared with nonlesional skin and with plaques after treatment with antimetabolic and antiinflammatory agents. Absorption of the anti-recombinant IL-6 antisera with purified fibroblast-derived IL-6 or with recombinant IL-6, but not bovine serum albumin, removed the immunostaining. Increased levels of IL-6 were detected in the plasma of patients with active psoriasis (mean 3 ng/ml) by using two different bioassays. IL-6 production by proliferating keratinocytes was suggested by IL-6-specific immunostaining in cultured normal and psoriatic keratinocytes and by the detection of mRNA specific for IL-6 in psoriatic epidermis by in situ hybridization. IL-6 stimulated the proliferation of cultured, normal human keratinocytes as assessed by two different assays. Thus, IL-6 could directly contribute to the epidermal hyperplasia seen in psoriatic epithelium as well as affect the function of dermal inflammatory cells.\r"

We used freshly obtained keratoacanthomas as well as Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from both types of tumors. DNA from 50 samples of each tumor type was analyzed for activating mutations involving codons 12 and 61. A relatively high percentage (30%) of HRAS mutations was found in the keratoacanthomas compared with 13% in the squamous cell carcinomas. The most frequent mutation identified is the A-T-to-T.A transversion in the second position of codon 61. The present findings demonstrate the involvement of the HRAS oncogene in human benign tumors. Moreover, they indicate that an activated HRAS oncogene is not sufficient to maintain a neoplastic phenotype and argue against a role of HRAS in the progression of skin tumorigenesis.\r"

Highly virulent S. typhimurium strains carrying inv mutations were defective for entry into Henle-407 cells while remaining unaffected in their ability to attach to cultured cells. When administered perorally to BALB/c mice, inv mutants of S. typhimurium had higher 50% lethal doses (LD50) than their wild-type parent strains. To the contrary, there were no differences in the observed LD50 when strains were administered intraperitoneally. In addition, inv mutants presented decreased ability to colonize the Peyer's patches, the small intestinal wall, and the spleen when administered perorally, although when administered intraperitoneally, they showed no difference in their ability to colonize the spleen compared to the wild-type parent strain.\r"

The mechanisms by which the genomic diversity takes place in individuals exposed to multiple virus isolates is yet to be elucidated. Genetic variation, in general, might result from mutagenic events such as point mutations, rearrangements (insertions and deletions), and recombination. In an attempt to evaluate the process of genetic diversity, we designed experiments to analyze recombination between HIV DNAs by using DNA transfection in cell cultures. Here we report the successful recombination between truncated HIV proviral DNAs with an overlap homology of 53 base pairs that leads to the formation of viable hybrid virus. Recombination was also seen between exogenous DNA introduced into cells and homologous HIV sequences resident in the cells. These results indicate that recombination among various HIV isolates may play a significant role in the generation of genetic diversity of HIV. Further, the method used here enables the construction of hybrid HIV genomes to identify the viral determinants responsible for tropism, replication, and cytopathic effects.\r"

Employing the mu-selective opioid agonist [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAMGO) in direct binding studies and in competition of labeled antagonist binding, we found that the major changes were a decrease in the number of sites with high affinity for agonist, a small reduction in total receptor number, and a loss in the ability of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate to regulate binding. A fraction of high-affinity mu receptors appeared to retain their high affinity for agonist and their sensitivity to guanine nucleotide analogue after the induction of morphine tolerance, possibly because the morphine concentrations achieved in brain were insufficient to uncouple all mu receptors from associated guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Some membrane preparations were treated with pertussis toxin, which has been shown to functionally uncouple mu opioid receptors from their effector systems. In these preparations, a single agonist-affinity state of the receptor was observed. The apparent dissociation constant for this affinity state in pertussis toxin-treated membranes was similar to the lower-affinity state observed in preparations from morphine-tolerant animals. In contrast to the changes observed at mu opioid binding sites, no significant changes in agonist affinity or binding density were observed for selective delta or kappa agonists, consistent with the development of selective tolerance at mu receptors.\r"

The muscles of the syrinx, the vocal organ of birds, are such mixed muscles. To study this heterogeneity of fiber type and innervation, we combined immunocytochemistry to classify muscle fibers with techniques to visualize neuromuscular junctions. One monoclonal antibody, S58, directed against a slow class of myosin, labels only fibers that have multiple terminals. We also examined the distribution of immunoreactivity for neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), which has been suggested to play a role in innervation of muscle and formation of neuromuscular junctions. S58-positive fibers have elevated N-CAM staining, indicating that multiple innervation of a fiber is correlated with the fiber's expression of high levels of N-CAM immunoreactivity. Most, and perhaps all, fibers that have multiple terminals also contain abundant N-CAM immunoreactivity. This suggests that N-CAM may play a role in the maintenance of multiterminal innervation in adult innervated muscle.\r"

Significant correlations were found between blood flow and temperature. Total flap blood flow, measured as venous outflow, also showed an initial transient decrease, but 2 hours after flap construction, venous outflow had returned to preoperative values. A significant increase in lactate release, together with increased oxygen consumption and glucose uptake, was seen 4 hours after the surgical intervention. Hypoxanthine release, indicating ischemia, was seen only during the first hour after flap elevation. Noradrenaline outflow was noted after 4 and 6 hours, but there was no parallel reduction in flap blood flow. A great deal of the flow reduction in acutely elevated island flaps may thus be due to primary hypothermia rather than to the degenerative release of noradrenaline, which seems to have no early effect on skin flap blood flow. On the other hand, the noradrenaline release may be linked to an increased metabolic activity in the skin flaps.\r"

The flap blood flow, measured by total venous outflow and laser Doppler flowmetry, was significantly lower after venous than after arterial occlusion.

Investment in vaccine research and development depends on epidemiology, market size, funding, and liability. Fear of liability inhibits innovation, adaptation of existing methods, and regulatory decision-making. Vaccine evaluation proceeds from animal and in vitro studies to controlled human clinical trials. Successive stages provide the information base necessary for decisions on vaccine approval for general use, but sociopolitical forces can affect the process. The World Health Organization establishes nonbinding international norms for vaccine acceptability that are adopted by many countries. Concerns for purity and safety need to be addressed along with cost and vaccine availability. For example, replacement of brain tissue-derived rabies vaccine in developing countries with a continuous cell line-derived vaccine is possible if purity is balanced in relation to safety. Substantially reducing the toll of infectious diseases will require cooperation and common-sense decisions.\r"

The toxicity of pertussis vaccines can probably be reduced and the immunogenicity increased by recently instituted improvements in purity and selectivity. Candidate vaccines containing inactivated pertussis toxin, with or without other components, are in use in Japan and in controlled trials elsewhere. Inactivated poliovirus vaccines have been improved over the past decade and presently show promise of inducing immunity with as few as two doses administered in infancy. At the same time, improved methods for delivering the oral poliovirus vaccine through mass vaccination campaigns are being increasingly employed throughout the developing world. Major improvements in the measles vaccine will probably come from the development of new stabilizers and the use of vaccines that are immunogenic in the presence of maternal antibody.\r"

In contrast, several new typhoid vaccines promise protection without reactogenicity. Attenuated oral vaccine Ty21a has been evaluated in three field trials of efficacy in Santiago, Chile, involving 530,000 schoolchildren. Three doses of Ty21a in an enteric-coated formulation given within one week provided 69% efficacy for at least four years. Fewer doses conferred less protection, while adding a fourth dose significantly enhanced protection; increasing the interval between doses did not improve protection. Large-scale vaccination with Ty21a appeared to cause a herd-immunity effect. Ty21a has reached the stage of being a practical tool for public health. With respect to other vaccines, the safety and immunogenicity of an auxotrophic (Aro-,Pur-) Salmonella typhi mutant (strain 541Ty) has recently been evaluated. Lastly, parenteral purified Vi polysaccharide of S. typhi was safe and immunogenic and provided 64%-72% protection (for at least 17-21 months) in controlled field trials in Nepal and South Africa.\r"

The first two approaches have been the most extensively studied in clinical trials, and all three types of vaccines are administered orally to maximize the stimulation of mucosal immunity. The live attenuated vaccine CVD103-HgR is inexpensive and was effective after a single dose but caused mild diarrhea in 4% of vaccinees. The killed whole cell plus B subunit vaccine is safe but requires the administration of multiple doses. The strong protective immunity conferred by the disease and the rapid progress recently achieved in vaccine development offer encouragement that a successful vaccine will soon be available.\r"

  ".W": "A major sporozoite surface antigen, the circumsporozoite protein, has been identified in all four malaria parasites affecting humans and in numerous species causing malaria in rodents and simians. The corresponding genes have been cloned and sequenced, and considerable similarities are apparent. An extensive central region of these proteins consists of tandemly repeated sequences of four to 16 amino acids. The sporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum has 37-41 repeats of four amino acids: NANP (asparagine-alanine-asparagine-proline). Most sera from people in endemic areas that react with sporozoites also recognize the dodecamer (NANP)3. Conjugated to a carrier, (NANP)3 is an excellent immunogen for rabbits and mice. NANP has recently served as the basis for two experimental malaria vaccines tested in volunteers. One of these vaccines, (NANP)32 tet32, was genetically engineered in Escherichia coli; the other consisted of the synthetic peptide (NANP)3 conjugated to tetanus toxoid. Most peptide-immunized volunteers developed antipeptide/sporozoite antibodies; however, there was no booster effect, and only one of three individuals was completely protected. For optimal protection, future vaccines must not only contain the B cell epitope but also induce T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells producing interferon-gamma, which has been shown to inhibit the development of liver-stage parasites.\r"

In children with meningitis, H. influenzae type b organisms are the most frequently encountered serotype, but in some countries type a strains are also implicated. In children with LRI, type b organisms are also important, but the proportion of organisms with other serotypes and non-typable strains is greater than that associated with cases of meningitis. In developing countries, nearly all cases of H. influenzae meningitis and a substantial fraction of cases of LRI occur in children younger than one year of age. This age distribution is younger than that seen in the continental United States, where more than one-half of the cases of invasive H. influenzae disease are in children older than one year of age. New type b polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are immunogenic in infants as young as two months of age and offer the promise of preventing H. influenzae type b disease in infants younger than one year of age. However, for developing countries, more complete data defining the populations at risk, the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines in children in different geographic regions, and the serotypes of the infecting organisms will be needed before successful cost-effective vaccination strategies can be devised and implemented.\r"

For this reason and because of the increasingly frequent isolation of multiply resistant pneumococci of the serotypes most often causing infection in childhood, prophylactic immunization offers the best prospect of reducing the incidence of such infections in the future. Studies of the immune system of humans have shown that immunologic maturation continues throughout the first decade of life and that responsiveness to some purified bacterial polysaccharides may be delayed until several years after birth. Vaccines of such capsular polysaccharides conjugated chemically to protein have been found to be immunogenic at an earlier age and to stimulate the development of IgM and IgG antibodies and of \"immunologic memory.\" Current investigations suggest that administration of polyvalent vaccines of polysaccharide-protein conjugates in infancy followed by the administration of vaccines of purified polysaccharides after the age of 10 years offers the prospect of reducing significantly the incidence of pneumococcal infections.\r"

Impediments to development may exist or arise at any point in this pathway (e.g., multiplicity of serotypes, inability to cultivate the pathogen, multistage life cycles with multiple antigens, unpredictability of epidemics, inadequate knowledge of pathogenesis and immunity, fear of gene splicing, need for an adjuvant, and lack of profitability). Diseases for which vaccines are not likely to be available in the next decade include trachoma, onchocerciasis, pneumonia due to Legionella and to mycoplasmas, amebiasis and giardiasis, schistosomiasis, syphilis, chlamydial urethritis, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and filariasis, and non-A, non-B hepatitis.\r"

Coupled with lack of scientific information is lack of economic incentive for the producer to undertake new areas of basic research on stabilization. Moreover, the means of protecting and rewarding the inventor are extremely weak, and no source of funds for meeting the costs is evident. It is critical, at this time, to weigh the costs of improving vaccine against those of establishing an effective cold chain. Developing a cold chain seems the more likely choice.\r"

In this enzymatically active protein, the cysteines were replaced by alpha-amino-n-butyric acid, a nongenetically coded amino acid. This structure, in which all 99 amino acids were located, differs in several important details from that reported previously by others. The interface between the identical subunits forming the active protease dimer is composed of four well-ordered beta strands from both the amino and carboxyl termini and residues 86 to 94 have a helical conformation. The observed arrangement of the dimer interface suggests possible designs for dimerization inhibitors.\r"

The long half-life of one to three days for the parent compound and seven to 15 days for the active metabolite, desmethylfluoxetine, is largely unaffected by age or renal impairment. Nausea, nervousness, insomnia, and headache are the most common side effects. Therapeutic doses do not affect cardiac conduction or cause orthostasis. A primary benefit of this drug is its significant relative safety in overdoses as compared to other antidepressants.\r"

Although monastic and chivalric orders throughout antiquity provided the beginnings with hierarchical organizations and a sense of voluntarism and vocation, it was not until the mid-19th century that the concept of a nursing service became codified and more hospital-oriented. The inception of a matronized nursing service in the Mobile City Hospital under the tutelage of the Superintendent, Dr. Willis Roberts, antedated the rapid expansion of nursing education and service recommended and instituted by Florence Nightingale. The former served as a paradigm of altruism as \"women attendants\" became formally associated with a hospital-based \"nursing service,\" initially under the directorship of a lay matron, Mrs. Sarah Dubois, and subsequently under a succession of Sisters of the Roman Catholic Order of the Sisters of Charity (America). Although ostensibly instituted to render care to \"female paupers,\" the matronized nursing service was readily expanded, and subsequently delivered care to the entire, predominantly indigent patient population. The paradigm was worthily perpetuated during the latter half of the 19th century in vitually all hospitals as nursing education and services continued to become more secularized and technologically sophisticated.\r"

There were seven cases of endomyometritis in the group given no antibiotic and none in the cefotetan group, a statistically significant difference (P less than .01). We conclude that prophylactic antibiotics are effective in reducing the incidence of endomyometritis after forceps delivery. We believe this is the first published study demonstrating this benefit.\r"

The operation was considered curative in only eight patients (35%). There were 13 complications in eight patients. There were no operative deaths. The survival ranged from three to 36 months. The survival for curative TG was a mean of 21.2 months +/- 3.3 SEM; for palliative TG, mean survival was 10.1 months +/- 1.1 SEM (P less than .001). These results suggest that gastric carcinoma that extensively involves the fundus and/or the corpus continues to be highly lethal, even when these tumors can be resected with a TG. Furthermore, even when the operation is considered \"curative\" and can be done with little or no operative mortality, the average survival was at best 21 months.\r"

Using ultrasound to measure the lumbar canal is relatively easy to do, and provides accurate values. In this paper we review the reports on this use of ultrasound, including our own experience in a case control study, and discuss the potential use of ultrasonic measurement as a screening tool to identify narrow lumbar canals.\r"

The technique of reversible truncal vagotomy by cooling (vagal cryo-interruption) was used to explore the influence, and extent of any influence, of the vagus nerve on contractions of the colon in unanesthetized monkeys. Each monkey was subjected to vagal cryo-interruption in the fasted and fed states. In both states this caused a significant decrease in contractions in the proximal, middle, and distal portions of the colon, compared with baseline control and recovery periods. These studies indicate that the vagus nerve plays a role in normal contractions of the intra-abdominal colon in both the fasted and the fed states and that it also plays a role in the gastrocolic response.\r"

Previous work suggests that tolerance to nutritional and lethal effects of TNF occur after repeated exposure to recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF). In this study pretreatment of rats with a single low intravenous dose of rTNF prevented subsequent death when a lethal dose of rTNF was administered 24 hours later (tolerance or tachyphylaxis). Pretreatment with rTNF also afforded protection against the lethal effects of either endotoxin or cecal ligation and puncture when rats were challenged 24 hours later. Recombinant TNF injected 6 hours after cecal ligation and puncture initially resulted in a significant survival advantage for treated animals. When this experiment was repeated with a different lot of rTNF, however, the therapeutic benefit of rTNF was not obtained until the dose was decreased by a factor of 10. Protection against the lethal effects of cecal ligation and puncture did not occur when rTNF was given 24 hours after the insult. A single low dose of rTNF can result in tolerance or tachyphylaxis to the lethal effects of TNF. The results suggest that the early administration of low-dose rTNF may be useful in the prevention and treatment of the lethality of sepsis.\r"

This study was designed to characterize more precisely cyclosporine-induced alterations in glucose homeostasis in a large animal model with hyperglycemic and euglycemic clamp studies in addition to simple bolus glucose (IVGTT) and insulin (IVITT) tolerance tests. In experiment 1, IVGTTs and hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed in eight ewes before and after 4 weeks of cyclosporine treatment. Studies were repeated 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. In experiment 2, IVITTs and euglycemic clamp studies were performed in seven ewes before and after 4 weeks of cyclosporine treatment. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were not affected by cyclosporine treatment. In experiment 1 cyclosporine did not alter IVGTTs; however, during sustained hyperglycemia, cyclosporine caused a 37% decrease in net glucose disposal (p less than 0.001) and a 39% decrease in plateau plasma insulin levels (p less than 0.05). In experiment 2 cyclosporine had no effect on IVITTs. Plateau insulin values in euglycemic clamp studies were lowered by 27% (p less than 0.05) after cyclosporine treatment. In addition, the metabolic clearance rate of insulin was increased by 25% (p less than 0.05), and the steady-state insulin clearance rate was increased by 16% (p less than 0.003). Measurements of insulin sensitivity were unchanged by cyclosporine. These experiments suggest that cyclosporine treatment results in impairment of sustained synthesis and secretion of insulin, increased insulin clearance, and unaltered insulin sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "Although the advent of cyclosporine has allowed dramatic improvement in survival rates after heart transplantation, long-term outcome remains limited by rejection and graft atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated the development of alloreactive lymphocytotoxic antibodies in baboon recipients of heterotopic cardiac transplants despite cyclosporine administration. The hypothesis of our study is that human heart transplant recipients given treatment with cyclosporine are also capable of generating strong humoral immune responses that might adversely affect clinical outcome. Serial serum specimens from 118 heart transplant recipients were tested against a reference panel of 70 cells for anti-HLA lymphocytotoxic antibodies. Patients with positive sera on at least three separate samplings at minimal intervals of 1 week were considered to be antibody producers (Ab+), and those with less than three positive sera samplings were considered nonproducers (Ab-). Donor lymphocytes were not available for most recipients for the assessment of the specificity of antibodies produced. Seventy-six of 118 patients (64%) were Ab+. One-year, 3-year, and 5-year actuarial survival rates were 81%, 70%, and 53%, respectively, for Ab+ patients compared with corresponding rates of 93%, 90%, and 90%, respectively, in Ab- patients (p less than 0.01). Graft atherosclerosis confirmed by coronary angiography or autopsy developed in 12 Ab+ patients (16%), compared with 1 of 42 Ab- patients (2.3%) (p less than 0.05). These data show that almost two thirds of heart transplant recipients produce anti-HLA antibodies after grafting that correlate strongly with adverse outcome. Immunotherapies directed at control of deleterious humoral immune responses need to be developed.\r"

In order to investigate energy expenditure changes in this setting, we used an eight-cage rat indirect calorimeter to measure resting energy expenditure (REE) in the well-defined model of rat cardiac transplantation. Preoperative baseline measurements of REE were performed on Lewis recipients of allogeneic (Wistar Furth) or syngeneic (Lewis) heterotopic abdominal cardiac grafts (80.3 +/- 3.3 kcal0.75/day). Postoperatively, REE was measured on days 1 through 10, 15, and 20. An abnormal REE was defined as a greater than 10% change from the preoperative value. All cardiac allografts were rejected on postoperative day 7, whereas syngeneic hearts contracted for more than 100 days. Both groups of animals had a hypermetabolic response to surgery on postoperative day 1 compared with preoperative values (93.0 +/- 7.6 kcal/kg0.75/day, p less than 0.01). On postoperative day 2, REE normalized to preoperative baseline values in the syngeneic group and remained unchanged for the duration of the study (80.4 +/- 1.0, p = 0.49). In the allogeneic group, on postoperative days 3 through 6 an abnormal REE was recorded in 22 of 28 measurements compared with only 3 of 16 in the syngeneic group (p less than 0.001). After transplant rejection, REE normalized to preoperative values in the allogeneic group. Characteristic changes in energy expenditure occur during transplantation rejection. These changes in REE preceded rejection in this animal model.\r"

The common mechanism by which endothelial cells are activated by these agents is unknown. We examined adherence of PMNs to cultured human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVE) pretreated with LPS (100 ng/ml), TNF (100 U/ml), and IL-1 (1 U/ml) in medium alone or medium containing protein kinase inhibitors H-7 or HA-1004. Both compounds inhibit a similar spectrum of protein kinases, but H-7 is an effective inhibitor of protein kinase C, whereas HA-1004 is not. We found that H-7 (25 mumol/L) reduced the adherence of PMNs to LPS-, TNF-, and IL-1-stimulated HUVE monolayers to 16.7% +/- 3.0%, 12.1% +/- 2.5%, and 18.3% +/- 2.9% of control, respectively (mean plus or minus standard error of three experiments); HA-1004 (25 mumol/L) did not inhibit endothelial adhesiveness. Cytotoxicity of H-7 was less than 10% in LPS-, TNF-, and IL-1-treated HUVE. Protein synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of tritiated amino acids, was not significantly impaired in LPS-treated HUVE concurrently exposed to H-7. We conclude that protein kinase C appears to be a necessary common mediator of endothelial cell activation by LPS, TNF, and IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of transplantation is the induction of immunologic tolerance. At present, nonspecific immunosuppression is used to prevent graft rejection and, commonly, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Nevertheless, nonspecific immunosuppressive therapy is frequently complicated by infection, malignant tumors, and drug toxicity. In order to examine whether hematopoietic chimerism can be used to induce specific allograft tolerance, we have reconstituted lethally irradiated Lewis rats with ACI bone marrow that has been depleted of T cells with use of immunomagnetic beads. This technique consists of binding OX-19, a mouse anti-rat pan-T lymphocyte monoclonal antibody, to magnetic polymer beads. Mixing of bone marrow or splenocytes with the bead/OX-19 complexes, followed by magnetic separation, results in significant depletion of T cells with minimal nonspecific cell loss. Immunomagnetic T-cell depletion of bone marrow, followed by reconstitution of a lethally irradiated host, allows for the development of stable, mixed hematopoietic chimerae without evidence of GVHD. These hosts are immunocompetent by clinical criteria. Recipients of untreated donor bone marrow that did or did not receive nonspecific immunosuppression demonstrated varying degrees of GVHD and reduced survival. The ability to rapidly and simply deplete T lymphocytes from bone marrow and produce stable, immunocompetent hematopoietic chimerae without GVHD may be an important method for tolerance induction to vascularized allografts.\r"

Temperature, blood, and tissue specimens were obtained at 2 hours. Blood pressure was measured over 4 hours in a separate group of awake rats. Mortality was assessed over 24 hours. Neither TNF (1 mg/kg) nor LPS (1 mg/kg) altered hematocrit, blood gases, temperature, or caused hypotension or mortality. If the same dose of TNF was combined with LPS, however, there was significant (p less than 0.05) hemoconcentration and metabolic acidosis associated with hypotension and 100% mortality by 4 hours. Pathologic changes were restricted to the small intestine and occurred in this group only. It was concluded that TNF does not cause hypotension or shock in the rat. TNF will cause lethal shock, however, if combined with a sublethal dose of endotoxin. This suggests that synergy between TNF and endotoxin is important in septic shock.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomised, controlled study alternate day prednisolone with an initial high dose phase (\"prednisolone only series\") has been compared with cyclophosphamide plus alternate day low dose prednisolone (\"cyclophosphamide-prednisolone series\") in 43 patients with previously untreated fibrosing alveolitis (five patients had received prednisolone in minimal dosage). In the prednisolone only series prednisolone 60 mg daily was given for one month and then reduced by 5 mg a week to 20 mg on alternate days or the minimum dose to maintain early improvement. Patients in the cyclophosphamide-prednisolone series received 100, 110, or 120 mg cyclophosphamide daily (depending on body weight) plus 20 mg prednisolone on alternate days. Treatment was continued indefinitely, or changed to the alternative regimen if the patient deteriorated, failed to improve, or developed drug toxicity. For response to treatment (as judged by change in breathlessness score, radiographic appearance, and lung function) patients were classified as improved, stable, or deteriorating. Deaths from cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis were also analysed. Improvement had occurred at one or more assessments in seven of the 22 patients in the prednisolone only series and in five of the 21 patients in the cyclophosphamide-prednisolone series. At three years, however, only two of the 22 patients in the prednisolone only series were still improved and three stable, compared with one and seven of the 21 patients in the cyclophosphamide-prednisolone series (three of the seven had stopped treatment because of toxicity). Life table analysis suggested better survival in patients in the cyclophosphamide-prednisolone series but this was not significant. At three years 10 of 22 patients in the prednisolone only series had died compared with three of 21 patients in the cyclophosphamide-prednisolone series. With death or failure of first treatment regimen as outcome there was a significant advantage to the patients having cyclophosphamide-prednisolone. This advantage was explained in part by the better lung volumes in this group on admission. After allowance had been made for total lung capacity (TLC), no other factor was predictive of outcome. Analyses of subgroups according to TLC on admission showed that patients with a TLC below 60% predicted did badly and those with a TLC of 80% or more predicted did well with both regimens. Patients with an initial TLC of 60-79% predicted did better with the cyclophosphamide-prednisolone regimen. Side effects were uncommon in both series and those due to cyclophosphamide resolved when treatment was stopped. The combination of cyclophosphamide with prednisolone may be an alternative to prednisolone alone with an initial high dose phase. Many patients, however, failed to respond to either treatment.\r"

Although ANCA have been described by several groups the precise antigenic targets are unknown, and detection of ANCA still relies on an indirect immunofluorescence assay technique. Several different patterns of fluorescence have been produced by using sera from different groups of patients, and insufficient information is available on the frequency of positive results and of the patterns of immunofluorescence obtained when serum from patients with vasculitis as a part of a generalised connective tissue disease is used. A study was carried out on serum from 240 patients, including 23 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 12 with microscopic polyarteritis, and 30 with various connective tissue diseases. Three patterns of fluorescence were observed: bright coarsely granular cytoplasmic, bright non-granular cytoplasmic, and weak diffuse cytoplasmic. The bright, coarsely granular pattern was 86% specific for Wegener's granulomatosis in this series and was observed in 18 of 23 cases. Other patterns of fluorescence were found in various conditions and were not of diagnostic value. The technique is simple, inexpensive, rapid, and reproducible.\r"

To study this further 11 adult patients with advanced chronic lung disease (FEV1 range 0.4-1.41), whose exercise endurance was limited by dyspnoea, were entered into a double blind, randomised, crossover study in which low dose morphine or a placebo was inhaled. The effects were assessed by an endurance exercise test at 80% of maximum work load. One hour after a control endurance test patients inhaled 5 ml of morphine 1 mg/ml or isotonic saline for 12 minutes from a jet nebuliser. An endurance exercise test was repeated 15 minutes later and change in endurance time recorded. The two endurance tests were repeated on a separate day, before and after inhalation of the alternative solution. In all tests 100% oxygen was inhaled from a demand valve. The mean (SD) increase in endurance time was significantly greater after the subjects had inhaled morphine (64.6 (115) s, 35%) than after placebo (8.9 (55) s, 0.8%; p less than 0.01). The mean dose of morphine nebulised was 1.7 (0.66) mg, giving a mean inhaled dose of about 0.6 mg, on the assumption of 30% retention of the nebulised dose by each patient. No side effects were reported. Possibly small amounts of morphine delivered to the lungs act directly on lung afferent nerves to reduce dyspnoea.\r"

The combination of rifampicin and ethambutol seems to be particularly effective, both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro sensitivity testing with single drugs may have a role in the future when the levels of in vitro resistance compatible with the clinical response to treatment are eventually established. Sensitivity testing against drugs in combination may prove useful for modifying treatment regimens in those patients who either fail to respond to initial chemotherapy or relapse. Further evidence on this will, it is hoped, emerge from the prospective studies currently in progress.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine whether cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid represent a reflection of disease activity in sarcoidosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells were obtained from 22 patients with sarcoidosis and from 10 normal control subjects and investigated by immunocytological methods. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was used to determine the relative proportions of phenotypically distinct subsets of macrophages and lymphocytes in the patients with sarcoidosis and to correlate them with clinical indices, such as disease duration, serum angiotensin converting enzyme, the chest radiograph, and results of pulmonary function tests. Patients with sarcoidosis had a higher percentage than the normal subjects of macrophage like cells expressing RFD1 (a class II associated antigen preferentially expressed by dendritic cells), an epithelioid cell antigen (RFD9), and a circulating monocyte antigen (UCHMI). The increase in RFD1+ cells appeared to be due to detection of antigen by this antibody on cells that were also expressing phenotypic markers of classical tissue macrophages (RFD7). The lymphocytes in lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis were characterised by increased expression of activation markers, such as interleukin-2 receptors (anti-Tac+), HLA-DR (RFDR+), and \"blast\" forms (expressing above normal concentrations of CD7 antigen). This was associated with increased proportions of the CD4+ (helper-inducer) T cell subset. Patients with sarcoidosis whose clinical indices suggested activity showed an increased number of macrophages coexpressing RFD1 and RFD7 antigens, of macrophages expressing UCHM1 and lymphocytes expressing activation markers. The expression of these markers was also increased on lavage cells from patients with radiographic evidence of widespread disease (chest radiographic stage II and III), but there was no relation with disease duration, pulmonary function, or serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity. Immunocytological analysis of lavage cells offers a probe for studying the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and may be of value in monitoring disease activity.\r"

  ".W": "The accelerated form of arteriosclerosis that occurs in the coronary circulation of transplanted hearts currently presents a major limitation to the long-term success of this therapy. The pathogenesis of this lesion is unclear. Recent advances in vessel wall biology have disclosed interplay between mediators of the immune response and functions of vascular cells of potential significance in the formation of this accelerated form of arterial disease. We hypothesize that the development of accelerated arteriosclerosis in the arteries of transplanted hearts represents a form of chronic immunologic reaction resembling delayed-type hypersensitivity localized in the graft's arteries, a manifestation of cellular immunity mediated in large part by a regionally acting cytokine network. We emphasize the active responses of intrinsic vessel wall cells, including inappropriate expression of HLA and the likely participation of cytokines derived from vascular cells as well as from infiltrating leukocytes in amplification and propagation of this localized chronic immune reaction. This mechanism, which involves helper T cells interacting with class II HLA, may distinguish transplantation-associated arteriosclerosis from typical acute rejection, which may involve primarily cytolytic T cells interacting with class I HLA. Lesions of the common variety of atherosclerosis manifest certain features of immune activation. Therefore, we further hypothesize that the transplantation-associated form represents an extreme case of processes that also contribute to usual coronary atherosclerosis. For this reason, study of the accelerated disease may aid understanding of atherogenesis in general. Unraveling the basic pathobiology of these clinically important arterial diseases should lay the groundwork for rational design of selective therapeutic strategies to prevent or retard their development.\r"

In acute rejection, inflammatory changes with a prominent blast cell component dominate. The main result is toxic damage of several parenchymal components, particularly the microvascular endothelium, resulting in necrosis of the parenchyma and loss of the allograft within days after transplantation. In the chronic type of rejection, inflammation also exists, but the major manifestations are different. Adventitial inflammation and perivascular cuffing of leukocytes result in concentric intimal proliferation and atherosclerosis. Very little experimental data exist, at present, on the mechanisms of transplant atherosclerosis and chronic rejection.\r"

However, there is a high correlation between vasostomy and antisperm antibody production leading to spontaneous sperm agglutination and immobilization. There is still considerable disagreement on whether antibodies are the primary causative agent. Our study provides evidence that fibronectin, a ubiquitous glycoprotein whose major function is cell-to-cell adhesion, could be a \"subfertility\" factor and contribute to male \"unexplained infertility.\" Semen from control, random, and vasovasostomy populations was studied using a sophisticated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results show that fibronectin is significantly present in all groups. The mean concentrations (micrograms/mL) were 753.9 for control, 566.4 for random, followed by significantly higher 1267.3 for the vasovasostomy group (p less than 0.05). The spermatozoa were assayed for bound fibronectin by flow cytometry. The mean percentage of cells bound after background subtract was 29.7 for control and 48.2 for the vasovasostomy group; the difference was significant (p less than 0.05). We conclude that fibronectin is present in semen and bound to sperm cells in great concentrations for individuals having undergone surgical insult and may contribute to male infertility particularly by sperm agglutination.\r"

Eighteen of the calculi were infection (struvite) stones and 7 were sterile stones. In 21 cases internal ureteral stents were positioned before ESWL, but no patient underwent pretreatment percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) or percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PNL). An average of 2.1 procedures including ESWL, PCN, or ureteral interventions were required to achieve a stone-free renal collecting system and ureter, or residual stone particles less than 4 mm in diameter confined to the renal collecting system. Sixty percent of the patients required no ancillary procedures after ESWL. There were no differences in the mean duration of hospitalization, need for post-treatment ancillary procedures, time to clearance of ureteral fragments, and incidence of residual stone particles among patients with infection and sterile stones. Of 23 patients observed greater than three months (mean 10.9 mos) after ESWL, 43 percent had residual stone particles in the renal collecting system. Expansion of these particles or stone recurrence in the absence of residual particles has not been observed. We conclude that large volume renal calculi may be managed effectively and safely with ESWL monotherapy.\r"

The patients improved with either treatment: ulcers healed more than twice as rapidly using cadexomer iodine (n = 38) as with standard therapy (n = 37) (P = .0025). Ulcers treated with cadexomer iodine showed trends toward less pain, exudate, pus, and debris, and a more rapid development of granulation tissue. Twelve patients crossed over from control treatment to the use of cadexomer iodine because of a failure to heal, but no patients switched to control therapy from the use of cadexomer iodine (P = .01). Except for occasional mild local burning in wounds treated with cadexomer iodine, no adverse effects were noted with either regimen.\r"

High mortality was found for total pancreatectomy, duct reanastomosis, and lack of surgical treatment, with lower mortality for Roux-en-Y anastomoses, suture and drainage, distal pancreatectomy, and duodenal exclusion and diverticulization techniques. Most patients required drainage only. The preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic trauma is difficult, with the diagnosis usually made during surgical repair for associated injuries. Blood studies such as amylase levels, diagnostic peritoneal lavage, and plain radiographs are not reliable. Computed tomographic scanning may be superior, but data are limited.\r"

The evidence suggests that the shortage is the result of an increased demand for nurses, not a decline in supply. The increased demand in large part has resulted from the substitution of registered nurses for licensed practical nurses, aides, and other patient services personnel. The substitution was feasible because nurses' wages have been depressed compared with those of other hospital employees. The shortage is likely to abate if nurses' wages increase, making substitution more costly. Even in the absence of continuing wage increases, hospitals could ease the shortage by restructuring patient services and enabling nurses to spend a greater portion of their time in direct patient care.\r"

Overall, physicians at the Scottsdale Memorial Hospital (SMH) approved 72% of HSAG-approved and denied 61% of HSAG-denied admissions. Of the 64 admissions, 3 or 4 of 4 reviewers (2 physicians and 2 nurses) agreed with the HSAG decision in 38 (59%), but 2 or more reviewers disagreed in the other 26 (41%). Disagreement between the 2 physicians occurred in 48% of the cases and disagreement between the 2 nurses in 33%. Even among admissions denied by SMH physician reviewers, the physicians would have admitted 23% of those patients under similar circumstances. In 28% of the HSAG-denied admissions, the reviewing physicians thought that the patients' health care would have been compromised if the admissions had not taken place. Despite well-defined criteria for the appropriateness of hospital admissions, the review process remains subjective, with much disagreement between peer review organizations and practicing physicians.\r"

Chronic renal failure is characterized by anemia, which is principally caused by erythropoietin deficiency. Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-hEPO) corrects the anemia of chronic renal disease and improves patient well-being, exercise tolerance, and cognitive function. The clinical pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and tolerance of r-hEPO are presented. Four major studies attest to r-hEPO's efficacy in the treatment of anemia of chronic renal disease and document potential toxicities of hypertension, iron deficiency, thrombosis, and bone pain. Careful attention to the extent of correction of the hematocrit, increased heparinization during hemodialysis therapy, and compliance with dietary restrictions may minimize the incidence and severity of adverse reactions. Resistance to r-hEPO may be due to iron deficiency, aluminum toxicity, or inflammation, including infection. Potential future uses of r-hEPO include the treatment of various other anemias, such as those seen in sickle cell anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and autologous blood donation. Controlled clinical studies in these areas have not been reported.\r"

Of the agents currently available for clinical use, nifedipine has been studied most extensively. This agent shows no beneficial effects in this setting and its use may in fact be harmful. Of the few trials that have been conducted with verapamil, none have shown decreased mortality. Verapamil may reduce infarct size although further confirmation is required. Diltiazem is the only agent that has been shown to have short- and long-term benefits in the patient with acute myocardial infarction. Proper patient selection is of utmost importance in ensuring successful therapy. In particular, those patients with non-Q-wave infarctions and/or normal left ventricular function can be expected to derive the most benefit in terms of reducing mortality and reinfarction rate associated with the acute event.\r"

Lean tissue and fluids containing electrolytes conduct the current and cell membranes serve as capacitors and account for capacitive resistance. Fat and bone are poor conductors. Measurement of the voltage drop of the applied current yields resistance (R) and reactance (Xc). R and Xc are used with height, weight, age, and gender in a number of multiple regression relationships to predict body composition compartments such as fat-free mass, lean body mass, extracellular mass, and body cell mass. The technique has been compared with and validated against traditional measures of body composition analysis. In clinical practice, BI has been used to monitor fluid status in burn and dialysis patients, assess changes of body cell mass with nutritional repletion, and predict pharmacokinetic parameters and dose of theophylline and aminoglycoside antibiotics. BI is a noninvasive, safe, rapid, and reproducible technique with exciting potential in clinical practice.\r"

Proposed mechanisms include von Willebrand Factor abnormalities, decreased prostacyclin production, and immune complex formation. Treatment modalities have been unsuccessful and the majority of patients reported have died. Immunoperfusion with staphylococcal protein A is the most effective treatment available and this new technique appears promising.

Several cephalosporins are compared using microbiological and pharmacokinetic data. For example, the microbiological activity of ceftriaxone lasts for at least 12 hours with Staphylococcus aureus and for almost 24 hours with Enterobacteriaceae. Clinical experience with beta lactams has demonstrated that maintaining serum concentrations above the target organism's minimum concentration required to inhibit 90 percent of the organisms for 50 percent or more of the dosing interval is associated with successful therapy.\r"

As a general rule, agents that are minimally protein bound penetrate tissue better than those that are highly bound, but they are excreted much faster. Among drugs that are less than 80-85 percent protein bound, differences appear to be of slight clinical importance. Agents that are highly protein bound may, however, differ markedly from those that are minimally bound in terms of tissue penetration and half-life. Drugs may bind to a wide variety of plasma proteins, including albumin. If the percentage of protein-bound drug is greater when measured in human blood than in a simple albumin solution, the clinician should suspect that the agent may be bound in vivo to one of these \"minority\" plasma proteins. The concentration of several plasma proteins can be altered by many factors, including stress, surgery, liver or kidney dysfunction, and pregnancy. In such circumstances, free drug concentrations are a more accurate index of clinical effect than are total concentrations. Formulary committees must grasp the clinical significance of qualitative and quantitative differences in protein binding when evaluating competing agents.\r"

In addition, members need to be briefed on the findings of antibiotic utilization reviews performed. In vitro activity should be compared among similar classes of antibiotics and, when possible, local resistance rates should be considered. The pharmacokinetic properties of an antibiotic, such as peak concentration, protein binding, distribution characteristics, and elimination half-life, should be evaluated during the selection process, as should total cost of the drug, including costs associated with monitoring therapy.

  ".W": "The use of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction has increased the number of patients presenting for assessment of myocardial viability. Stress SPECT 201Tl perfusion imaging performed in the conventional manner with delayed imaging at 4 hr can identify a large percentage of patients with ischemic but viable areas of myocardium. In some patients, delayed imaging up to as long as 24-48 hr after exercise may be required to show 201Tl redistribution indicative of viability. Thus, in most patients, stress 201Tl scintigraphy will correctly identify the presence of viable myocardium. PET imaging, with its ability to assess blood flow and metabolism separately, offers the ability to identify myocardial areas with diminished blood flow but preserved metabolism. Areas with such a blood flow-metabolism mismatch may benefit from revascularization, even in the absence of 201Tl redistribution. The exact role PET will play in the initial evaluation of patients presenting for assessment of myocardial viability remains to be established as more clinical data are accumulated.\r"

Conventional sonography and Doppler sonography of the ligamentum teres were performed in 33 normal subjects and in 39 patients with portal hypertension due to chronic liver disease. An apparent ligamentum teres vessel (i.e., hypoechoic channel) was identified on sonograms in 32 (97%) normal subjects (diameter 0.6-1.9 mm) and in 35 (90%) patients with portal hypertension (diameter 1.1-22 mm). In the portal hypertension group, the apparent vessel had a diameter of greater than 3 mm in only 20 patients (51%), but in 32 patients (82%) it was shown on Doppler examination to be a patent paraumbilical vein (i.e., hepatofugal venous signal). A patent paraumbilical vein on duplex Doppler sonography is therefore a specific sign of portal hypertension. The addition of Doppler imaging to conventional sonographic examination significantly increases the sensitivity for the diagnosis of portal hypertension by demonstration of a paraumbilical vein.\r"

Dilated tubes were distinguished from bowel loops by a lack of peristaltic activity and from pelvic veins by a lack of moving low-level echoes on real-time sonography. We conclude that the findings of dilated fallopian tubes on endovaginal sonography are sufficiently characteristic to allow the diagnosis to be made with this technique.\r"

Hypoxic ischemic ischemic injury is more common: severe cerebral edema was seen in two cases, occipital hemorrhagic infarct in one case, and mild cerebral edema in 17 cases. During ECMO, sonograms showed that the hemorrhage in patients with small subependymal hemorrhage or cyst before ECMO did not extend while on ECMO. Typical germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage was seen uncommonly (three cases). Unusual parenchymal hemorrhage did occur. Hypoxic ischemic brain injury was more common: parenchymal hemorrhage was seen in three cases, severe cerebral edema in three cases, and infarction in three cases. Hypoxic ischemic brain injury probably occurs before ECMO, with a delay in visualization. CT after ECMO detected additional abnormalities, particularly peripheral areas of hemorrhage and infarction not visible on sonograms, and is now being performed on all patients. More emphasis should be placed on better screening of infants being considered for ECMO treatment to identify irreversible anoxic brain injury, not just hemorrhage.\r"

We studied the possibility that the microspheres can be used to enhance the Doppler signal from systemic arteries and the portal vein. Doppler sonography of the aorta, renal artery, intrarenal branch, and portal vein was performed after the IV injection of saline or microspheres in doses of 1.0, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1 ml in four rabbits. With appropriate blinding of the observers, subjective estimates of enhancement of the Doppler signal were made in each case. All injections of saline had no detectable effect. All four doses of microspheres enhanced the Doppler signal in the aorta in all rabbits. Signals from the renal artery enhanced in all rabbits after injections of 0.3 ml or greater, but in only two rabbits after 0.1 ml. Although the 1.0-ml dose enhanced the Doppler signal from the intrarenal arterial branch in all rabbits, the 0.5- and 0.3-ml doses enhanced signals in two and the 0.1-ml dose in one. The effect was typical for bolus IV injections. The mean time from injection to onset of enhancement was 5 sec and the effect lasted for 12 sec. Portal venous signals were evaluated in three rabbits. Ten injections were made, four at 1.0 ml and two at each of the lesser doses. Portal vein signals enhanced after all four injections of 1.0 ml of microspheres but after only one of the six injections of lower doses. Our results show that the IV injection of air-filled human albumin microspheres enhances the Doppler signal from systemic arteries and the portal vein and that the microspheres have the potential to serve as a contrast agent for Doppler sonography in humans.\r"

This article addresses several major questions related to subtypes, structure, signal transduction mechanisms, and regulation of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The application of biochemical and cell and molecular biologic techniques has provided many new insights regarding alpha-adrenergic receptors. Two (and perhaps three) distinct alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes have been identified, and subtypes may exist for alpha 1-adrenergic receptors as well. These multiple subtypes imply much greater diversity among alpha-adrenergic receptors than among beta-adrenergic receptors. Alpha-adrenergic receptors are membrane glycoproteins with several common structural features (including seven membrane-spanning domains with extracellular amino terminus and intracellular carboxyl terminus) that are shared with other types of membrane receptors linked to guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (G) proteins. These G proteins appear to link alpha-adrenergic receptors to multiple effector systems, including enzymes such as adenylate cyclase and phospholipases, and ion channels. The receptors themselves are dynamic entities, the number of which is regulated as a consequence of a poorly understood life cycle. Although unproven, it seems likely that several important clinical disorders represent alterations in alpha-adrenergic receptors themselves or in the G proteins or effector systems to which these receptors couple. New tools for studying receptor structure and function should help clarify the numerous, inadequately understood issues regarding alpha-adrenergic receptors and their possible alteration in disease states.\r"

  ".W": "The majority of deaths associated with ischemic heart disease occur suddenly because of disturbances in cardiac rhythm culminating in ventricular fibrillation. Past research has focused on elucidating the biochemical membrane mechanisms responsible for the adverse electrophysiologic alterations in the ischemic heart, with major emphasis on the influence of adrenergic neural factors. It has been demonstrated that both alpha 1-and beta-adrenergic mechanisms contribute to arrhythmogenesis in the ischemic heart. In the normal heart, alpha 1-adrenergic input has very little effect on electrophysiologic indices. However, during early ischemia and reperfusion, enhanced alpha 1-adrenergic responsivity associated with a twofold reversible increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in vivo has been demonstrated. Likewise, in a variety of species, alpha 1-adrenergic inhibition with prazosin markedly decreases the incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with either myocardial ischemia or subsequent reperfusion. One major manifestation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation during reperfusion of ischemic myocardium is an increase in intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+). It has been demonstrated that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium increases intracellular Ca2+ in reversibly injured tissue, and that the gain in intracellular Ca2+ is prevented by alpha 1-adrenergic inhibition with hydroxyphenylethyl aminomethyl tetralone, even when administered just prior to reperfusion. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the alpha 1-adrenergic-induced increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ contributes to the decline in mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that even single-dose intervention with alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitors may improve markedly the functional recovery and extent of ultimate necrosis in humans after coronary thrombolysis. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors during ischemia, we used isolated adult canine ventricular myocytes exposed to hypoxia. Thirty minutes of hypoxia at 25 degrees C or 10 minutes of hypoxia at 37 degrees C resulted in a threefold reversible increase in the density of surface alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and a threefold increase in the cellular content of long-chain acylcarnitines. Inhibition of carnitine acyltransferase I abolished not only the accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines during hypoxia but also the increase in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Exposure of normoxic myocytes to exogenous long-chain acylcarnitines (1 mumol/liter) for 10 minutes also increased alpha 1-adrenergic receptor number. These findings indicate that the sarcolemmal accumulation of long-cha\r"

  ".W": "Doxazosin is the latest in a series of highly selective postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors. It is readily absorbed, with high bioavailability and a relatively long plasma half-life, neither of which property is influenced by age. This accounts for the prolonged pharmacologic activity of doxazosin following a single oral dose. Its prime pharmacodynamic activity resides in its ability to counter sympathetic vasoconstriction of the systemic arteriolar resistance vessels and venous capacitance system, which enables the drug to target the major pathophysiologic abnormality in hypertension, i.e., the generalized systemic arteriolar constriction. The widespread vasodilation induced by doxazosin relieves both cardiac preload and afterload and, consequently, reduces left ventricular wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption. In hypertension, doxazosin reduces blood pressure both at rest and during exercise by reduction of systemic vascular resistance without precipitating substantial reflex cardiac stimulation. The effects are maximal on the standing blood pressure between two and four hours after ingestion; due to doxazosin's relatively slow absorption, postural hypotension is infrequent. Its antihypertensive activity is maintained over 24 hours following a single oral dose, and the optimal dose range is 2 to 8 mg once daily. The antihypertensive efficacy of doxazosin has been shown to be comparable with that of other alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitors, beta-blocking drugs, diuretics, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast to other conventional antihypertensive drugs, a unique feature of alpha-adrenoceptor-inhibiting drugs, including doxazosin, is their ability to reduce the plasma concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. This contrasts with the opposite effect on lipid levels induced by hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol seen in comparative studies. Side effects show no predilection for any organ system, and the overall incidence of such effects compares well with those of other commonly used antihypertensive drugs. This unique combination of antihypertensive efficacy and favorable effect on blood lipid levels indicates that once-daily treatment with doxazosin holds considerable promise in the treatment of hypertension, both from the point of view of its antihypertensive efficacy and also from its primary preventative potential.\r"

Recently it has been suggested that treatment with alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitors may be helpful in this condition. Eighty patients with prostatic obstruction were entered into a double-blind parallel study of prazosin versus placebo. There were 25 withdrawals or exclusions, leaving 55 patients for analysis. Mean maximal flow rates increased significantly more in patients treated with prazosin than in patients treated with placebo (p less than 0.005), but there was no significant reduction in maximal voiding pressure. The mean number of voids, recorded on diary cards, was reduced from an initial 10.0/24 hours by 2.1 in the final week, a significantly greater reduction than in the placebo group (p less than 0.01). However, there were no statistically significant changes in the filling cystometrograms. When patients were classified as responders or nonresponders in terms of bladder filling, urine flow, bladder emptying, weekly average of voids/24 hours, and nocturia, the proportion of patients responding to prazosin was significantly greater in all categories except bladder filling and emptying. It was concluded that prazosin at a dose of 2 mg twice daily is a safe and effective treatment for prostatic obstruction and may be used in patients awaiting surgery and in those who are unfit for operation.\r"

  ".W": "The drug treatment of mild hypertension has been shown to afford protection against fatal and nonfatal strokes, congestive heart failure, progression to more severe levels of hypertension, and all-cause mortality, but not against the complications of coronary artery disease. The lack of benefit against coronary artery disease may result from failure to reduce other risk factors or because the drugs employed increased coronary risk. It can be taken as axiomatic that effective preventive antihypertensive therapy is more likely with drugs with mechanisms and sites of action that are focused on the underlying pathophysiology than with drugs that lower blood pressure by means unrelated to the hypertensive process. Adrenergic predominance plays a major role in the initiation and maintenance of essential hypertension and, consequently, the alpha-adrenergic receptor inhibitors were among the first substances to receive serious consideration as antihypertensive agents. However, since these drugs are nonselective, feedback control of transmitter norepinephrine was lost and, consequently, the clinical expectations of the early alpha-adrenergic receptor inhibitors in the treatment of high blood pressure were not fulfilled. The discovery of selective postjunctional alpha 1-adrenergic-receptor inhibitors, such as prazosin and doxazosin, which preserve feedback control of transmitter norepinephrine release, was the crucially important step in the development of specific drugs to combat the hyperactivity of adrenergic vasoconstrictor nerves in hypertension. These drugs have been shown to normalize hemodynamics in hypertensive patients. They lower blood pressure through a reduction in peripheral resistance at rest and during exercise, independent of changes in heart rate and blood pressure, with minimal reflex activation or tolerance development. Alpha 1-adrenergic-receptor inhibitors, such as prazosin and doxazosin, represent an attractive choice for initial therapy in all grades of hypertension and are especially appropriate in hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure, asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease, renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or gout, and in those involved in vigorous work, sports, or exercise. There are no known contraindications to these drugs, except in patients who are sensitive to quinazolines.\r"

Prazosin GITS was well tolerated; the most common adverse experiences reported were headache, dizziness, and fatigue.

Nevertheless, therapeutic trials of patients with mild hypertension have not demonstrated benefits from lowering arterial pressure, in terms of reduced mortality rates from coronary events. This may, in part, be due to the fact that many of the antihypertensive agents used in these trials adversely influence lipid and lipoprotein levels. Thus, agents that are lipid-neutral or that favorably influence the lipid profile, such as selective alpha 1-inhibitors, are receiving increasing attention for the treatment of mild hypertension. Recent insights into these issues are considered.\r"

  ".W": "Control of high blood pressure has failed to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD). Hypercholesterolemia, which is common among hypertensive patients, cigarette smoking, and hypertension are the major risk factors for CHD. To minimize CHD risk, elevated blood pressure and atherogenic lipid levels should be lowered, but various antihypertensive agents appear to adversely affect lipid levels, actually precluding the CHD risk reduction expected from blood pressure control. Doxazosin, a once-daily, long-acting, alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitor, not only is effective therapy for essential hypertension but also has a favorable impact on lipids. During controlled studies of doxazosin's antihypertensive efficacy, the following blood lipid levels were measured: total cholesterol, total triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (including HDL2 and HDL3), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoproteins (apos) AI and B. Results showed total cholesterol (-0.8 to -8.9 percent), total triglycerides (-5.0 to -17.4 percent), and LDL (-9.0 to -16.9 percent) were reduced. The positive prognostic indicators, HDL (+0.7 to +13.0 percent) and HDL:total cholesterol ratio (+3.1 to +26.3 percent), were increased. Apo B decreased, but apo AI remained unchanged. In these hypertension studies, doxazosin has favorably reduced two major CHD risk factors. As part of a new, long-term, controlled, multicenter trial, the prospective benefits of these risk factor reductions on CHD morbidity and mortality will be quantified for doxazosin and other antihypertensive agents.\r"

  ".W": "The major risk factors for coronary heart disease remain high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and abnormal serum lipid levels, including total cholesterol but more specifically elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Observations made from large-scale trials almost a decade ago suggested that commonly used antihypertensive agents, such as thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, may adversely influence serum lipid levels. Over time, we realized that these lipid alterations persist long term and are of sufficient magnitude to potentially account for important differences in coronary heart disease risk reduction among various antihypertensive drug regimens. Considering recent National Cholesterol Education Program and Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommendations concerning lipid and blood pressure treatment, it is prudent and timely to rethink our approach to antihypertensive therapy in patients with abnormal serum lipid levels. Therefore, when lipids are a concern, appropriate dietary treatments should be advised and antihypertensive therapy that has a beneficial or neutral impact on serum lipid levels should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "There are 36 reported cases of metastatic pituitary carcinoma and almost half (44%) of these were associated with syndromes of hormonal hypersecretion. The case of a 56-year-old acromegalic man with cervical lymphatic and spinal metastases from a primary pituitary carcinoma is described. Elevated basal levels of plasma growth hormone (GH) and insulin growth factor-1/Somatomedin C (IGF-1/SmC) were found. GH levels did not increase after TRH or LHRH administration but decreased after L-Dopa and glucose. Immunostaining of the metastatic tumor for GH and electron microscopy findings confirmed the diagnosis of pituitary GH-secreting carcinoma. Striking clinical improvement and a 46% decrease in plasma GH levels were observed with bromocriptine treatment, although IGF-1/SmC levels increased during therapy. The clinical course of most reported cases of pituitary adenocarcinoma has been one of progressive intracranial expansion of a pituitary neoplasm. In only 25% were metastatic lesions discovered antemortem, and disabling symptomatology caused by metastases was rare. Only four previously reported patients of 36 with pituitary carcinoma had acromegaly.\r"

Increasing evidence has accumulated showing that subsets of patients within this broad syndrome exist in whom recognition and proper therapy may result in meaningful prolongation of life or potential cure. In this review, clinical clues and diagnostic aids for identification of nine treatable subsets of patients with the carcinoma of unknown origin (CUO) syndrome are emphasized. Current state-of-the-art treatment for each subset with subsequent end results are stated.\r"

  ".U": "89349202\r", 
  ".W": "The incidence of beta cell damage attributable to pentamidine treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia is increasing in frequency because of the AIDS epidemic. We carried out in vitro studies in perfused rat islets using insulin secretion as an index of beta cell damage to study the effects of pentamidine and to test whether glucose can prevent toxicity in this physiologic model. Isolated islets were cultured for 16-18 hours of static incubation, in a culture medium containing 100 mg/dl glucose, with or without pentamidine (10(-6) M, a therapeutic concentration). Islets were then perfused with media containing 60 mg/dl followed by 300 mg/dl glucose concentrations to study the insulin secretory response. Incubation of islets with pentamidine was associated with subsequent basal hypersecretion of insulin (0.40 +/- 0.05 microU/islet .5 minute vs. 0.18 +/- 0.04 microU/islet .5 minute, p less than .005), and an insulin secretory response to glucose which was completely abolished (0.05 +/- 0.04 microU/islet .5 minute versus 1.12 +/- 0.02 microU/islet .5 minute, p less than .005). To determine whether glucose may protect against the effects of pentamidine, islets were then exposed to high glucose concentrations during simultaneous incubation with pentamidine. Coincubation with high glucose did not prevent these insulin secretory defects. A more extended culture of pentamidine-treated islets in the absence of pentamidine and at a glucose concentration of 100 mg/dl did not result in any recovery of insulin secretion. We conclude that pentamidine-induced beta cell damage is irreversible, not preventable by incubation with high glucose concentrations, and may therefore result from a mechanism different to that of alloxan.\r"

  ".W": "An intrauterine growth-retarded infant is commonly defined as one weighing less than the 10th percentile in birth weight for its gestational age. However, because there is no standard population from which to derive these percentiles, the birth weights that serve as the cutoff point in various published studies may differ by several hundred grams at any gestational age. For this reason, we examined the studies from which the currently used 10th-percentile standards are derived to determine which factors may be responsible for the variation. In addition to obvious differences in the populations and geographic areas on which they were based, studies differed in how gestational age was determined, whether the gestational age was \"rounded\" or given in completed weeks, which types of infants were excluded, whether the studies were hospital or population based, and whether they were controlled for sex of the infant and race and parity of the mother. These differences in study methodology may be as or more important than the population differences in defining the 10th percentile cutoffs. A single national standard for intrauterine growth retardation would allow comparison between studies of risk factors, diagnostic tests, management, and long-term follow-up status of fetuses and infants with intrauterine growth retardation.\r"

Among 13,486 women with singleton pregnancies interviewed at the time of screening (15 to 20 weeks of gestation), 3.9% had high and 3.4% had low values. A high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein value was associated with the following adverse outcomes: neural tube defects (relative risk = 224), other major congenital defects (relative risk = 4.7), fetal deaths (relative risk = 8.1), neonatal death (relative risk = 4.7), low birth weight (relative risk = 4.0), newborn complications (relative risk = 3.6), oligohydramnios (relative risk = 3.4), abruptio placentae (relative risk = 3.0) and preeclamptic toxemia (relative risk = 2.3). A low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein value was associated with chromosomal defects (relative risk = 11.6) for fetal death (relative risk = 3.3). Either high or low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values were associated with 34.2% of all major congenital defects, 19.1% of all stillbirths and fetal-neonatal deaths, 11.0% of major pregnancy complications, and 15.9% of serious newborn complications. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening provides an important adjunctive tool for the identification of high-risk pregnancy and adverse neonatal outcome.\r"

Approaches have relied on the apparent \"shortened\" femur length of fetuses with Down syndrome. Unfortunately, significant intercenter variation has been reported in the magnitude of this femur length reduction. In an effort to overcome many of these potential biases and better estimate the magnitude of femur length shortening in fetuses with Down syndrome, a retrospective review of femur length differences between 16 Down syndrome and 194 control fetuses was carried out. All scans were performed by one examiner who used the same equipment and measurement technique. A significant reduction in the observed to expected femur length ratio for a given biparietal diameter was identified in the Down versus control fetuses (0.9574 95% confidence interval 0.9197, 0.9952 versus 0.9999 95% confidence interval 0.9913, 1.0086) (p less than 0.008). However, the magnitude of this reduction was not sufficient to permit the use of this sonographic approach as an isolated marker for fetal Down syndrome.\r"

All eight cases resulted in the birth of a live infant without other abnormalities. Postnatal intubation, which was carried out in all six fetuses with hydrothorax, was always followed by spontaneous respiration. Subsequent thoracocentesis resulted in the collection of 50 to 500 ml of serous fluid. Sustained intubation (7 days) was necessary in only two infants because of developing respiratory distress as a result of prematurity or recurrent pleural fluid accumulation. All eight infants were alive and well at the age of 1 month. Although in the present study noninvasive management of isolated fetal hydrothorax seems to have been justified, a larger multicenter study is needed to compare survival with and without pleuroamniotic shunting.\r"

The group with an increase in systolic-diastolic ratio had more perinatal complications as demonstrated by two stillbirths, a higher incidence of cesarean deliveries for fetal distress, and more admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit. Significant differences were found when gestational age at delivery, placental weight, birth weight, and the number of small muscular arteries in the placenta were compared. Since gestational age may have accounted for the difference in placental findings, patients were matched for gestational age. The placental weights were comparable, but there were fewer small muscular arteries in those patients with an increase in systolic-diastolic ratio (p less than 0.001). In addition, when these findings were examined to determine the influence of diminished uterine flow velocity, none was found.\r"

  ".W": "Total percent glycosylated hemoglobin (A1a + b + c) was measured before 16 weeks' gestation in 105 insulin-treated diabetic women enrolled for prenatal care at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Seventy-three of the infants were normal, 14 had malformations, and there were 18 spontaneous abortions. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin level for the entire study group was 9.2%, compared with 9.4% for those pregnancies ending in abortion, 8.9% for those resulting in normal infants, and 10.3% when malformations occurred. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin value for women delivered of normal infants was significantly lower than the mean of those with malformed infants. Ten of the 14 malformations occurred in mothers whose early pregnancy values exceeded the mean of the entire study group. There was also an association between malformations and White classification of maternal diabetes since 10 of the 14 fetal anomalies occurred in women assigned to White Classes C, D, F, H, and R. When the distribution of malformations was analyzed according to both glycosylated hemoglobin level and White Class, there was evidence of an interaction to suggest that hyperglycemia increases the relative risk of fetal malformations when associated with maternal diabetes of longer duration and or with vascular complications.\r"

  ".W": "The amnion is believed to be derived from either cytotrophoblastic cells or embryonic ectoderm. However, it produces and secretes CA 125, which is considered a differentiation antigen of fetal coelomic epithelium derived from the mesoderm of germ cells. To verify this, the immunohistochemical localization of CA 125 in human fetal tissues (between 7 and 23 weeks of gestation) derived from the ectoderm, endoderm, or mesoderm, and in the fetal membranes and placenta was studied. Among the mesoderm-derived tissues, only the fetal coelomic epithelium-related tissues were positive for anti-CA 125 from 15 weeks of gestation. The endoderm-derived tissues did not react with anti-CA 125. However, among the ectoderm-derived tissues, only the periderm reacted with anti-CA 125 from 7 weeks until it sloughed from the stratum intermedium by 23 weeks of gestation. Among the fetal membranes and placenta, only the amnion reacted with anti-CA 125 from 9 weeks to term. These findings indicate that the amnion and the periderm, both of which constitute the epithelia covering the amniotic cavity, in addition to the fetal coelomic epithelium-related tissues, produce CA 125.\r"

Psychiatric disorders also appear to have an important role in the etiology of and vulnerability to substance use problems in adolescents. Although the comorbidity of substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders in adolescents is recognized as an important factor in the treatment of adolescents, further research is needed to establish its prevalence, genetics, and clinical implications.\r"

Data are from the 1980 National Medical Care Utilization and Expenditure Survey. Regression analysis revealed that Medicaid children were more likely than both privately insured and uninsured children to visit an office-based physician. Also, Medicaid children with at least one visit to any setting had a higher number of visits than uninsured children. Such factors as age, health status, number of children in the family, educational status, and income also accounted for differences within the low-income population. The results suggest that access to physicians' services (including office-based physicians) can be increased by expanding Medicaid eligibility to uninsured low-income children and by improving private health insurance benefits among the underinsured.\r"

Four isolates exhibited decreased susceptibility to chloroquine (IC50 greater than 60 ng/ml), and one exhibited decreased susceptibility to quinine (IC50 = 161 ng/ml). Three isolates showed decreased susceptibility to mefloquine (IC50 = 10-11 ng/ml).

CS antigen was localized on the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) membrane and pellicular complex of recently invaded sporozoites and on electron-dense masses of sloughed CS antigen in the host cell cytoplasm. CS antigen persisted throughout the complete EE cycle of P. berghei on the surface of EE schizonts and was incorporated into the plasma membrane of budding EE merozoites. Erythrocytic merozoites were not labeled by Mab 3D11, indicating that these 2 populations of merozoites differ in antigenic composition. Significant internal labeling occurred in 50 hr EE schizonts in association with the limiting membranes of peripheral vesicles and short, tube-like structures attached to their outer surfaces. These vesicles contained an electron-dense flocculent material also present in the PV space. Association of CS antigen with the limiting membranes of these vesicles suggests that they either develop as endocytotic invaginations of the schizont plasma membrane or transport newly synthesized CS antigen from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi of developing EE schizonts to the parasite surface.\r"

Twelve patients received four injections of 20 mL of 2% lidocaine at 2-hr intervals. Epidural distribution was assessed by injection of 99mTc-DTPA diluted in saline on the preoperative day and diluted in an equal volume of 2% lidocaine on the morning before surgery and again after the fourth injection of lidocaine 6 hr later. The distribution of 99mTc-DTPA in the epidural space was unchanged during the three measurements despite significant tachyphylaxis in both sensory analgesia and motor blockade (11 of 12 patients had sensory analgesia 2 hr after the first injection in contrast to only 3 of 12 patients during the third injection). In another six patients 20 mL of 2% lidocaine were injected three times at 2-hr intervals before surgery, with measurements of serum concentrations of lidocaine after the first and last injections. Despite tachyphylaxis (no patient had sensory analgesia 2 hr after the third injection), there was no difference in the rate of disappearance of lidocaine from the epidural space as assessed by plasma lidocaine concentration curves during the first and third injection (0.5 +/- 0.1 and 0.3 +/- 0.04 microgram.mL-1.min-1, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Corticosterone responses paralleled beta-EP but were significant only in normal controls. Propranolol pretreatment did not reduce postburn beta-EP and C rises in autotransplanted animals. Therefore, since circulating factors contribute in vivo to pituitary-adrenal responses, the widespread practice of using \"stress hormone\" responses to quantitate perioperative stress or pain may in some circumstances be flawed.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of pentoxifylline on intermittent claudication were evaluated at a dose of 1200 mg/day in an open-label twelve-week study on geriatric patients with chronic occlusive arterial disease (COAD). Standardized treadmill testing and clinical signs and symptoms of COAD were followed up before and during drug administration. Twenty-four subjects with a mean age of 73.5 years, capable of walking between 20 and 200 meters on the treadmill, were entered into the trial; 22 participated for eight weeks and 19 completed the study in terms of treadmill walking distance measurements at 12 weeks. The mean walking distance for all patients was increased 111% over baseline at week 12. Thirteen subjects were considered drug responders (greater than or equal to 50% increase in treadmill walking distance) and 9 were considered nonresponders (less than 50% increase). Improvements in clinical signs and symptoms of COAD were noted. Decreases in elevated systemic systolic pressures (but not diastolic) were unexpectedly observed in many drug responders. Seven of 19 males reported sexual function improvements while receiving pentoxifylline. Fourteen (58%) of the 24 subjects reported mild side effects of dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, or insomnia; no subjects were withdrawn from the study because of side effects. In summary, pentoxifylline improved function and symptoms in 13 of 22 geriatric patients with intermittent claudication; the drug was safe and well tolerated at the usual dosage in this geriatric patient population.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of feeding different infant formulas on incidence of atopic disease was assessed in a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial among \"high risk\" infants with family history of atopy among first-degree relatives. The incidence of atopic eczema, wheezing, rhinitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, and colic was noted and serum IgE antibodies to milk were estimated. Seventy-two infants were recruited into each of the following groups: cow milk whey hydrolysate formula (NAN/HA), conventional cow milk formula (Similac), soy-based formula (Isomil), and exclusive breast feeding for greater than or equal to 4 months. The number of infants who exited for reasons other than atopy and were excluded from analysis were 4, 5, 4, and 12 in the four groups, respectively. The incidence of one or more symptoms of possible allergic etiology was five of 68 infants fed NAN/HA, 24 of 67 infants fed Similac, 25 of 68 infants fed Isomil, and 12 of 60 breast-fed infants. Among symptomatic infants, skin prick test to milk proteins was positive in four out of five infants fed NAN/HA, 16 of 24 fed Similac, 2 of 25 fed Isomil, and 7 of 12 breast-fed. IgE antibodies to milk were found in 2 of 68, 9 of 67, 0 of 68, and 6 of 60 infants in the four groups, respectively. It is concluded that exclusive breast feeding for more than 4 months is partially protective against the development of atopic disease among high risk infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight subjects had daily recordings of their respiratory symptoms and peak flow rates during and out of the pollen season. Airway response to methacholine was measured at 1-week to 2-week intervals. Pre-season spirometry and NSAR were normal in all subjects. Their PC20 methacholine ranged from 64 to greater than 256 mg/mL. During natural pollen exposure, all subjects had symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis. The only chest symptom observed was coughing. No significant change in peak flow rates was observed throughout the study. A significant increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine occurred in five subjects although it did not reach the asthmatic range (less than 16 mg/mL). This change in NSAR was reproduced after antigen (tree pollen) challenge in the laboratory in one of the subjects. A significant increase in blood eosinophils was observed during seasonal pollen exposure. This study shows that following natural antigenic exposure, NSAR can increase in non-asthmatic subjects with allergic rhinitis, although it may not reach the \"hyperresponsive range,\" and is associated with the development of a cough. These data suggest that natural exposure in non-asthmatic atopics may induce an inflammatory reaction in the airways to a degree that may increase NSAR.\r"

The groups were analyzed for success rate, time required for insertion, and complications. The techniques were equally successful (87% in the basilic vein group compared with 91% in the subclavian vein group), and their complication rates were similar (10% compared with 12%). The subclavian vein catheter was inserted more quickly (8.3 minutes compared with 14.4 minutes [P = .0001] for the basilic vein group). Percutaneous subclavian vein catheters can be used successfully in patients with hypovolemic shock and can be place quickly with low complication rates.\r"

Third-degree heart block, hypotension, and hypocalcemia were only transiently responsive to calcium infusions, inotropic agents, and epicardial pacing. Cardiopulmonary arrest with electromechanical dissociation ensued. Standard cardiopulmonary bypass was used to allow sufficient time for liver detoxication. Serum levels of verapamil fell during the bypass procedure, and the patient's cardiac status improved. However, continued absorption of drug after bypass resulted in a level of 4 mg/L, unresponsive circulatory failure, and death. Early, aggressive gut decontamination and the potential value of cardiopulmonary bypass procedures in poisoning that lead to cardiac depression are emphasized.\r"

We have examined this relationship in a longitudinal study of eight children and 12 adults. Measurements of reactivity to methacholine were made every 2 to 3 wk over a period of 12 to 18 months, deriving the dose that caused a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20). Throughout the study, all patients kept a daily record of symptoms and treatment and twice daily measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF). A significant relationship was found between subjects' overall reactivity (median PD20) and both their average day-to-day variation in morning PEF (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.016) and diurnal variation in PEF (Spearman's rho = -0.60, p = 0.004). However, examining the temporal relationship between reactivity and asthma within subjects, individual PD20 measurements were not consistently related to concurrent asthma severity: in only six subjects did changes in PD20 generally reflect simultaneous trends in symptoms or PEF. In several patients, exacerbations of asthma occurred in the absence of bronchial hyperreactivity (PD20 greater than 12.8 mumol). We conclude that nonspecific bronchial reactivity is only one mechanism underlying airflow obstruction in asthma, and that its relationship to the clinical state of asthma is not sufficiently close to be of practical clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "Many patients with systemic illness are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) and placed on life support. This occurs in patient populations even when the projected mortality rate might be as high as 80 to 90%. Patients with systemic illness often are life-support-dependent in ICUs as chronically critically ill patients for many weeks. In order to make decisions concerning withholding or withdrawing life support, more information is needed concerning the survival of ICU patients with systemic illness. Historically, it has been well recognized that critically ill patients who have major organ-system failure have high mortality rates. Studies began to be published in the middle to late 1970s. However, the patient populations studied in different ICUs could not be compared because the evaluation and classification criteria were different. A well-tested and effective classification system that will assist in determining the ICU survival of patients with systemic illness has been developed in the last several years. This system depends upon an acute physiology assessment and chronic health evaluation and is known as the APACHE II system. This generalizable classification system has helped in showing that patients with systemic illness and multisystem organ failure have very high mortality rates. For example, mortality for patients with three or more organ-system failures persisting after 3 days is 98%. Numerous studies have identified that chronologic age is associated with increased mortality rates. However, a better assessment would be biologic age, which would take into account both chronologic age and health status. ICU survival of patients with cancer, hematologic neoplasms, renal failure, liver failure, AIDS, and burns is reviewed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This report presents a model for relating readily available clinical and physiologic measurements to prognosis from mechanical ventilation. Using data from 571 acutely ill, ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care units of 12 hospitals, it illustrates the relationship between the disease, the initiating respiratory failure, the acute severity of the disease, and the patient's age and chronic health status and the patient's probability of survival. The results indicate that, of the 296 deaths among the 571 ventilated patients, 142 (48%) could be identified on the day of ICU admission to be at a 75% or greater risk of hospital death; 49 of these patients were estimated to have a 90% or greater risk of death. After 3 days of ICU treatment, estimates for hospital mortality increased to 97% (39 patients). We believe that such estimates, when available from a larger number of patients and combined with additional information on the patient's desires, expectations, preillness quality of life, and prognosis for long-term survival, can be helpful in decisions to withhold and withdraw mechanical ventilation.\r"

  ".U": "89349905\r", 
  ".W": "To describe the clinical presentation and progression of obstructive lung disease after marrow transplantation, we examined a sequential sample of 35 patients who had allogeneic marrow transplantation between January 1980 and January 1987, were 16 years or older, had normal pulmonary function tests before transplantation, and developed airflow obstruction defined as FEV1/FVC less than 70% and FEV1 less than 80% predicted 50 days or more after transplantation. Cases were selected from 1029 adult (older than 16 years) patients who underwent allogeneic marrow transplantation during the same period. Patients with airflow obstruction presented with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, or wheezing, or a combination. In 80% the chest radiograph was normal. Airflow obstruction was diagnosed within 1.5 years after transplantation in 33 of 35 patients. Clinical, extensive, chronic graft-versus-host disease was present in 24 patients. Only 4 patients had a complete response to primary therapy of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Serum IgG and IgA levels were decreased in 15 and 25 patients, respectively. The FEV1 declined rapidly (decrease in FEV1 greater than 30% between tests) in 21 patients, but 14 patients with slowly progressive or reversible disease were identified. Mortality was 65% at 3 years after transplant, a significantly higher value (P = 0.016) than the 3-year mortality rate of 44% in a comparison group of 412 concurrent patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease who were 16 years or older, survived more than 80 days after transplantation, and had normal pulmonary function. We concluded that obstructive lung disease after marrow transplantation may be variable with respect to time of onset and rate of progression. Obstructive lung disease was frequently associated with serum immunoglobulin deficiency and clinical, extensive, chronic graft-versus-host disease that was not readily responsive to treatment. Mortality was high but long-term survivors were identified.\r"

  ".W": "We describe four women who presented with systemic sclerosis several years after cosmetic augmentation mammoplasty with silicone-gel implants. The interval between implantation mammoplasty and the onset of systemic sclerosis ranged from 6 to 15 years. All patients fulfilled the criteria established by the American Rheumatism Association for systemic sclerosis and had Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia, and evidence of pulmonary or gastrointestinal involvement. Enlargement of lymph nodes draining the prostheses was noted in two patients. Antinuclear antibodies were detected in three patients and showed speckled or nucleolar patterns. Removal of the prostheses in two cases did not result in improvement of systemic sclerosis. Evidence of silicone leakage from the implants included the following. The observation by light microscopy of refractile particles in tissues distant from the prostheses, the observation by electron microscopy of electron-dense structures consistent with silica, and the definitive identification of the element silicon by energy-dispersive analysis in these electron-dense structures. A marked, chronic inflammatory infiltrate containing lymphocytes, \"foamy\" histiocytes, and larger numbers of multi-nucleated giant cells with vacuoles and asteroid bodies was found at the same sites. Our demonstration that silicone escapes from elastomer-silicone-gel breast implants and appears to be closely associated with a chronic inflammatory reaction suggests that silicone plays a role in the development of certain cases of systemic sclerosis.\r"

Typical neuropathologic findings include gliosis, focal necrosis of neurons, perivascular inflammation, formation of microglial nodules, multinucleated giant cells, and demyelination. That HIV-1 is the direct cause of this neurologic syndrome is strongly supported by the available evidence. In addition, several studies have identified the monocyte-macrophage as the predominant cell type in the brain infected with HIV-1. However, the mechanisms by which the infected monocytes-macrophages mediate neurologic dysfunction and destruction have not been elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To provide an overview of the physiologic long-term and late effects of adult cancers and cancer treatments by a review of the medical and nursing literature. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Primarily from an English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1980 to 1988) and Index Medicus (1980 to 1988). STUDY SELECTION: After a consensus review by four observers, 285 articles were selected that addressed the stated purpose. DATA EXTRACTION: Four observers assessed the literature using predetermined criteria for eliciting information about long-term and late effects. RESULTS AND DATA SYNTHESIS: Much has been written about the acute phases of cancer and cancer treatments. In comparison, relatively few data are available that define physiologic long-term: and late effects of cancer treatments in adult survivors. Review of the existing data showed that these sequelae may affect virtually any body system months or years after treatment ends. In addition, few prospective studies dealing with physiologic survivorship issues have been done. CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers need to be aware of long-term or late complications that may affect the increasing number of adult cancer survivors. Attention to treatment regimens in the acute cancer phase and careful follow-up once the disease is eradicated may help to prevent or manage these complications. More prospective research should be done in this area.\r"

Type II collagen was identified in Meckel's and Reichert's cartilages, the cartilage plate of the auricle and external acoustic meatus, the ossicles, eustachian tube cartilage, and the otic capsule. Type II collagen also appeared with the development of structures in noncartilaginous parts including the tympanic membrane, tympanic annulus, basilar membrane, spiral limbus, spiral ligament, and osseous spiral lamina, Rosenthal's canal, the maculae of the utricle and saccule, and the semicircular canal membrane, crista ampullaris, and endolymphatic duct. Type II collagen is distributed widely in the ear after the early stages of development. Thus, type II collagen should be considered an important structural component of the ear.\r"

The bla mRNA levels determined by 1-min pulse-labeling with [3H]uridine were significantly higher in a lincomycin-containing culture than in the control culture, indicating that stimulation of beta-lactamase synthesis is caused by an increase in the amount of bla mRNA. The enhancing effect of lincomycin was observed in strains harboring pBR322 delta P1 and pBR322 delta P3, which lacked the P1 or P3 promoter, respectively, as well as in the strain harboring pBR322. S1 nuclease analysis showed that the half-life of bla mRNA increased about 2.7-fold when lincomycin was present. These results indicate that the increase in beta-lactamase synthesis caused by lincomycin is due to an increase in the stability of bla mRNA rather than activation of its synthesis.\r"

The cause of this side effect is not known for certain, but in past studies it has sometimes been associated with the ability to culture herpes simplex virus type 1 from the mouth. In a double-blind prospective trial, patients with head and neck tumors treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy were treated with either acyclovir or placebo. Although the frequency of culture-positive herpes simplex virus was low in the untreated group, it was significantly lower, zero, in the acyclovir-treated group. However, there were no differences in the frequency or type of mouth lesions experienced by patients receiving either radiation or chemotherapy who were taking acyclovir or placebo. These results suggest that herpes simplex virus is not a frequent cause or complication of oral lesions afflicting this patient population.\r"

  ".W": "The association (attachment and/or uptake) of Mycobacterium leprae with cultured Schwann cells was studied at 8 and 72 h in the presence of a new antileprosy compound, deoxyfructoserotonin (DFS), as well as conventional antileprosy drugs such as rifampin (RFP) and 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS). DFS significantly inhibited bacterial association with Schwann cells at 8 h. RFP also affected the association of M. leprae but not to the same extent as DFS. A similar inhibition at 8 h was noted when M. leprae but not Schwann cells were pretreated with DFS or RFP for 5 days before infection of cultures, implying that modulation was achieved through some form of drug action on bacteria. DDS had no effect on M. leprae association; however, the combination of DFS and DDS was neither antagonistic nor additive. At 72 h postinfection, when attached but noninternalized bacteria were removed with trypsin-EDTA from Schwann cell cultures containing DFS or RFP, a 50% reduction in the number of bacteria in the drug-treated group was obtained as compared with the numbers in drug-free cultures. This indicated a slow entry of M. leprae into Schwann cells in the presence of these drugs. Collectively, these observations point to differing requirements for late and early association of M. leprae with Schwann cells, besides suggesting a role for DFS and RFP in the prevention and minimization of M. leprae-induced nerve damage in vivo.\r"

Despite their clinical importance, the mode of quinolone action and mechanisms of resistance are poorly understood at the molecular level. Using a DNA fragment enrichment procedure, we isolated the gyrA gene from a uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain that encodes a gyrase A protein cross-resistant to a variety of quinolones. When complemented with gyrase B subunit, the purified A protein reconstituted DNA supercoiling activity approximately 100-fold more resistant to inhibition by enoxacin than the susceptible enzyme and failed to mediate quinolone-dependent DNA cleavage. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the gene differed at 58 nucleotide positions compared with the K-12 gyrA sequence. The 875-amino-acid residue-resistant gyrase A protein differed at three positions from its wild-type E. coli K-12 counterpart: tryptophan, glutamate, and serine replaced serine, aspartate, and alanine residues at positions 83, 678, and 828, respectively. By genetic analysis of chimeric gyrA genes in a gyrA(Ts) background, we showed that the Ser-83----Trp mutation in the gyrase A protein was solely responsible for high-level bacterial resistance to nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones.\r"

C. Pedersen, E. M. Ho, M. L. Brown, and J. K. Yamamoto, Science 235:790-793, 1987). We have examined the reverse transcriptase of this virus to determine whether it is similar enough to the reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to enable its use as a model for chemotherapy for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The FIV reverse transcriptase is similar to that of HIV-1 in sensitivity to the noncompetitive inhibitor phosphonoformate (Ki, 0.3 microM) and relative insensitivity to phosphonoacetate. This enzyme was also sensitive to two competitive inhibitors, the 5'-triphosphates of 2', 3'-dideoxythymidine (Ki, 3.4 nM) and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT; Ki, 6.2 nM). The ratios of Ki/Km for these two competitive inhibitors are similar to the ratios calculated from previously reported data for the HIV-1 enzyme assayed under identical conditions. In contrast, the FIV enzyme is different from the reverse transcriptase of avian myeloblastosis virus in sensitivity to those inhibitors. The replication of FIV in Crandell feline kidney cells was inhibited by AZT; virus production was inhibited more than 95% by 1.0 microM AZT.\r"

SHV-5 beta-lactamase caused decreased susceptibility to most penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams, except imipenem and compounds which have a C6 or C7 alpha-methoxy substituent. beta-Lactamase inhibitors (clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam) inhibited its activity and showed a synergistic effect when associated with different hydrolyzable beta-lactam compounds. Hybridization studies suggested that this enzyme may be related to, or derived from, the SHV enzyme. Increased MICs of cephamycins and temocillin associated with a decreased synergistic effect of the inhibitors on K. pneumoniae 160 might be linked to a decrease in two outer membrane proteins.\r"

The common symptoms in these patients are chest pain, cough, and dyspnea. Joint pain or clubbing of the fingers is present in nearly half of the patients. As with diaphragmatic tumors in general, many neural tumors of the diaphragm are malignant. We believe that all such tumors should be resected through a thoracotomy incision, which affords optimal exposure of the diaphragm.\r"

  ".W": "Aneurysms of the thoracic aorta remain a challenge to surgeons. My early experience began in 1950, when I excised a large aneurysm in one of Dr Alfred Blalock's patients. The patient survived and was cured. This experience convinced me that aortic aneurysms could be treated successfully by aggressive surgical means. Treatment, however, has changed from the early emphasis on excision of the lesion to the present belief in restoration of circulatory continuity using a suitable Dacron graft, or endoaneurysmorrhaphy.\r"
