  ".W": "The basement membranes of bovine cornea are found to contain an angiogenic endothelial cell mitogen, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), as determined by heparin-affinity chromatography, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and stimulation of capillary endothelial cell proliferation. The growth factor appears to be bound to heparan sulfate and is released from the cornea by treatment with heparin, a hexasaccharide heparin fragment, heparan sulfate, or heparanase, but not by chondroitin sulfate or chondroitinase. These findings indicate that basement membranes of the cornea may serve as physiologic storage depots for an angiogenic molecule. Abnormal release of this growth factor could be responsible for corneal neovascularization in a variety of ocular diseases. Physiologic and pathologic neovascularization in other tissues may also be initiated by release of stored angiogenic factors from the basement membrane. The sequestration of angiogenic endothelial mitogens in the basement membrane may be a general mechanism for regulating their accessibility to vascular endothelium.\r"

The author attempts to raise professional consciousness of core issues in the philosophy of science by examining the status of truth, theory, and observation in psychiatry. He evaluates prominent approaches to the problem of knowledge, particularly those of the \"subjectivists\" and \"relativists,\" such as Schafer and Spence, and the \"empiricists\" and \"inductivists,\" such as the proponents of DSM-III. Drawing on contemporary philosophy of science, the work of William James, and the classical Greek conviction that more truth resides in the middle than at either extreme, the author mediates between these rival points of view.\r"

Patients showed significantly larger VBRs and third ventricle widths than control subjects. Patients also showed significantly greater prefrontal markings in terms of both the number of individuals affected and the degree of difference. The relative differences on measures of VBR and prefrontal atrophy did not appear gender related, but the difference in third ventricle width between schizophrenic and control women was greater than that between schizophrenic and control men.\r"

We followed a hypothetical cohort of 3.5 million children from birth to age 30 assuming 95 per cent coverage with 98 per cent effective vaccine. Primary reliance on IPV would result in more cases of paralytic poliomyelitis as well as more susceptibles remaining in the population than would be expected with continuing OPV use (74.1 vs 10.0 cases and 5.9 per cent vs 1.1 per cent susceptibles, respectively). However, with OPV use, most cases of paralysis seen would be associated with the vaccine. Our analysis supports a continuation of current US policy placing primary reliance on OPV but the conclusion is heavily dependent on assumptions of risk of exposure to wild virus in the United States. Major declines in risk of exposure to wild virus could alter the balance significantly.\r"

This policy places contacts at risk of paralysis from an untested, unlicensed \"spread virus\" vaccine and places infants at risk for an unproven, theoretical benefit to others, not themselves. The licensed killed poliovirus vaccine provides equivalent protection to those vaccinated, with no risk to recipients or contacts. The preceding analysis by Hinman, et al, is an interesting exercise in modeling, but many of their assumptions are open to question. Their sweeping conclusions are not justified by the type of analysis performed, which should yield an overall assessment of a decision environment not a single optimal choice. No measure of perceived social consequence or patient attitude is included, although this is of central importance today. Their report lends an aura of credibility to one conclusion, but this credibility is illusory at best. The major social issue today is not which vaccine to use, but how should polio immunization policy be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "The Gib 13 monoclonal antibody was raised against eggs of Onchocerca gibsoni and subsequently found to react with a phosphorylcholine epitope designated as the T15 idiotype. Since an immunoradiometric assay based on the Gib 13 monoclonal antibody holds promise for serodiagnosis of filariasis, the goals of the current study were to evaluate phosphorylcholine epitope production and release by various parasite stages and to assess changes in serum epitope levels during different phases of Brugia malayi infection in jirds. Extracts of B. malayi adult male worms, female worms, and microfilariae contained Gib 13 monoclonal antibody-reactive antigens of Mr 25-30,000, 57-90,000, and approximately equal to 200,000. Adult female worms secreted ten-fold more epitope than microfilariae on a weight basis. Phosphorylcholine-containing antigens were localized in female and male worms, respectively, in egg-bearing regions and the intestines. Assessment of the relationship between serum levels of Gib 13 antibody-binding epitope and parasitologic status of B. malayi-infected jirds showed that the immunoradiometric assay distinguishes patent infected from uninfected control animals, detects a significant rise in epitope level during the prepatent phase of infection, and is unaffected by diethylcarbamazine-induced reduction in the intensity of microfilaremia. There was a direct positive correlation between serum epitope level and female adult worm load. Quantification of serum phosphorylcholine epitope of the T15 idiotype may be useful as an indirect measure of parasite burden in humans with lymphatic filariasis that is independent of microfilaremia.\r"

Antigens were spot-filtered through the membrane. Membranes were dipped into small vials of sera. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with enzyme-conjugated antiglobulin which, when exposed to substrate, produced a colored insoluble product. The antibody detection protocol was completed within 50 min and was compared with a standard plate enzyme immunoassay. Chickens were experimentally infected with eastern equine encephalomyelitis and St. Louis encephalitis and bled on a daily basis. The dot immunoassay correctly identified 99% (123/124) of the eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus and 100% (67/67) of the St. Louis encephalitis virus antisera. Sera from sentinel chicken flocks in Maryland were also assayed. These data indicate that the dot immunoassay should be considered as an alternative to current assays for the screening of sera for antibodies to virus antigens. This assay could easily be performed in the field and allows for the screening of antibodies to several different viruses in one test.\r"

The assay used drugs which were serially diluted in the field and determined effective drug concentrations by quantitating schizont maturation after a variable incubation period. Based on the ID50 values, a series of isolates from Yala in southern Thailand were shown to be resistant to chloroquine (187 nM) but only moderately resistant to amodiaquine (23.7 nM), a structurally related 4-aminoquinoline. Five aminocarbinols were evaluated. The parasites were resistant to quinine (219 nM), but comparatively much more susceptible to mefloquine (9.04 nM), halofantrine (1.23 nM), and enpiroline (6.23 nM). The isolates were also relatively sensitive to WR 194,965 (9.04 nM). Two dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (WR 99,210 and pyrimethamine) were tested. The isolates were comparatively sensitive to a dihydrotriazine, WR 99,210 (2.85 nM). The in vitro values for pyrimethamine (1,870 nM) were higher than the values for the other drugs tested, but were less than values from other regions of Thailand. As compared to a survey conducted in this region four years previously, values for chloroquine, pyrimethamine, amodiaquine, and mefloquine have remained relatively unchanged. However, there was a greater than 20-fold rise in the susceptibility values for quinine, suggesting the introduction of quinine-resistant isolates from eastern Thailand into southern Thailand during this period.\r"

The in vitro antimalarial activity of pyronaridine was compared to activities of standard antimalarials against multidrug-resistant isolates of P. falciparum from eastern and northern Thailand using an assay based on the inhibition of schizont maturation. Isolates from eastern Thailand (n = 30) were susceptible to pyronaridine (IC50 8.40 nM), mefloquine (IC50 6.97 nM), and amodiaquine (IC50 12.7 nM) and resistant to chloroquine (IC50 361 nM), quinine (IC50 388 nM), and pyrimethamine (IC50 11,800 nM). The isolates from northern Thailand (n = 7) showed no statistical difference in susceptibility to pyronaridine (IC50 10.1 nM), amodiaquine (IC50 7.29 nM), and mefloquine (IC50 5.48 nM); however, isolates were significantly more susceptible to chloroquine (IC50 167 nM), quinine (IC50 248 nM), and pyrimethamine (IC50 1,980 nM). These data suggest a lack of cross-resistance between pyronaridine and either chloroquine, quinine, or pyrimethamine. Using the same assay system the in vitro activity of pyronaridine was evaluated against isolates from treatment failures of mefloquine or enpiroline from eastern Thailand. The IC50 values for mefloquine against five recrudescent isolates were significantly higher (IC50 16.4 nM) than the field isolates collected from the same region (IC50 6.97 nM); however, there was no significant difference in the pyronaridine susceptibility between the isolates from the field study (IC50 8.89 nM) and the isolates from the treatment failures (IC50 8.40 nM). These observations suggest a lack of cross-resistance to mefloquine following treatment failure with either mefloquine or enpiroline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the first survey involving 101 people, the IRMA-positive rate was 56.4% and then significantly declined to 16.5% during the second survey involving 79 people of the same group. The parasitological-positive rates were likewise decreased from 11.9% to 1.3% (P = 0.015) during these two seasons. IRMA-positive rates were significantly higher than the corresponding parasitological-positive rates (P less than 0.0001 and 0.002 for the first and the second surveys, respectively). The geometric mean IRMA binding activity of samples collected in the first survey (1,726 cpm) was significantly higher than those collected during the second survey (920 cpm, P = 0.001). Regression analysis showed that IRMA activities were linearly correlated with the parasite counts by microscopic examination (r = 0.629, P = 0.022).

The first changes observed in both parasites after exposure to pyronaridine occurred in the food vacuoles. This suggests that the target organelle of this drug may be the food vacuole of malarial parasites. In addition, rapid alterations were also noted within the pellicular complex of both plasmodia.\r"

The results indicate that 14 of 20 (70%) convalescent patients and 14 of 22 (64%) residents of endemic areas responded to the R32tet32 antigen. However, only 8 of 29 (28%) patients with acute P. falciparum malaria responded. When 4 of the convalescent patients who remained in a malaria-free area were restudied 5-10 months after the acute infection, they were either not responsive or their responses had greatly diminished. These findings show that sensitization to R32tet32 occurs following a natural P. falciparum infection, but the cellular immune response to sporozoite antigens may be short-lived and may be suppressed during acute P. falciparum malaria.\r"

Thirteen different isolates were screened for reactivity of surface antigens with a panel of 8 heterologous human immune sera and an immune rabbit serum. Surface immunofluorescence was detected in several isolates with some but not all the human sera, and not all sera reacted with the \"positive\" isolates. These results indicate a high degree of polymorphism of the surface antigens of different P. vivax isolates. Sera from patients who had suffered multiple malaria attacks and the immune rabbit serum (which was raised by immunizing with 7 different isolates) recognized surface antigens on more isolates than sera from patients who had experienced only one attack of malaria, indicating that repeated exposure to the disease confers immunity against a spectrum of variants of a polymorphic malarial antigen(s) prevalent in nature.\r"

The current study investigated the effect of experimental diabetes on the susceptibility of the Syrian hamster to the induction of exocrine pancreatic carcinoma by the carcinogen BOP. Diabetes was induced with the B-cell toxin streptozotocin. Three groups of animals were studied: nondiabetic control animals and animals with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, and a third group of animals in which the diabetogenic effect of streptozotocin was blocked with nicotinamide. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes significantly inhibited the induction of pancreatic carcinoma by BOP, decreasing the incidence of carcinoma to 24 percent compared with an incidence of 75 percent in nondiabetic control animals (p less than 0.002). In diabetic animals, the degree of inhibition of carcinogenesis paralleled the severity of the diabetes. Blocking the diabetogenic effect of streptozotocin with nicotinamide restored the incidence of induced invasive pancreatic carcinoma to that occurring in nondiabetic control animals. In the hamster model, diabetes appears to have a strong influence on susceptibility to the development of pancreatic carcinoma.\r"

Pancreases obtained from 18 cadaveric organ donors were isolated and perfused by way of the splenic artery utilizing a Krebs bicarbonate buffer in a single-pass perfusion system. Hormonal stimulation and inhibition of pancreatic polypeptide secretion were assessed, as was the influence of direct electrical stimulation of celiac neural fibers innervating the pancreas. In this in vitro human model, pancreatic polypeptide cell secretion was inhibited by hyperglycemia, although the presence of gastric inhibitory polypeptide augmented the pancreatic polypeptide cell response. Perfusion with low levels of insulin and splanchnic nerve stimulation augmented the response of the pancreatic polypeptide cell to hyperglycemia and gastric inhibitory polypeptide. Since the immunoreactive pancreatic polypeptide response was augmented when insulin and somatostatin release was inhibited by perfusion insulin or nerve stimulation, we conclude that the pancreatic polypeptide cell is regulated by the ambient degree of somatostatin release, insulin release, or both. These findings support a centrifugal pattern of intraislet blood flow.\r"

Quantitative assessment of portal blood flow by duplex ultrasound correlated with qualitative portal perfusion grading by angiography, and direction of flow was always accurately determined by duplex ultrasonography. Although the angiographic portal perfusion grade did not change significantly in the early postoperative period after distal splenorenal shunting, a decrease in mean portal blood flow of more than 50 percent was documented by duplex ultrasonography. Duplex ultrasonography appears to be at least as accurate as angiography and is an acceptable alternative to this more invasive technique for the longitudinal assessment of portal blood flow.\r"

Their plasma was then assayed for carbon-14 activity. Seven of the 14 shocked animals demonstrated increased plasma carbon-14 activity during or after shock. The mortality rate was 100 percent 80 hours postshock, and all animals had E. coli on subsequent blood culture. The seven rats without increased plasma carbon-14 activity had a survival rate of 83 percent postshock. Sham-shocked animals did not exhibit plasma carbon-14 levels greater than the background levels. These data suggest that bacterial translocation occurs during hemorrhagic shock and that the gut is the source of the bacteremia seen during hemorrhagic shock.\r"

  ".W": "With the refinement of fine-needle aspiration, the specific applications of thyroid imaging techniques need to be reevaluated for efficiency and cost containment. No thyroid imaging test should be routinely obtained. Radionuclide scanning is most beneficial in evaluating the functional status of thyroid nodules when fine-needle aspiration is inadequate, the findings are benign, or when there is no discrete nodule that is palpated in an enlarged gland. When fine-needle aspiration is unavailable or unreliable, radionuclide scanning becomes a first-line diagnostic tool. Ultrasonography should be used primarily for identifying a solid component of a cystic nodule, determining the size of nodules on thyroxine suppression that are not easily palpable, or for performing guided fine-needle aspiration. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging both have a definite role in the evaluation of thyroid tumors. Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computerized tomography for the evaluation of metastatic, retrotracheal, or mediastinal involvement of large thyroid tumors or goiters. Careful selection of the diagnostic techniques will ensure more accurate diagnosis and reduce unnecessary patient costs in the treatment of thyroid cancer.\r"

With grip 1, the first and fourth fingers were put in the rings and the second finger was put around the leg of the holder, whereas with grip 2, all the fingers were put around the holder. Without waver, the mean value was 2 +/- 1.5 mm with grip 1 and 1.4 +/- 1.1 mm with grip 2 (p less than 0.01) and with waver, 1.2 +/- 1.1 mm and 1.1 +/- 10.9 mm (p value not significant). Wavering reduced the deviation (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, the accuracy was not as precise as the surgeon expected and grip 2 was more accurate, although equivalent accuracy was gained by more wavering with grip 1, thus, there was a greater potential for injuring the tissue.\r"

Heparin pharmacokinetics are poorly understood, but when the usual doses are given intravenously, heparin is rapidly removed from the blood and has a half-life of approximately 90 minutes. Warfarin is not a true anticoagulant but is readily absorbed after oral administration. It interrupts the coagulation mechanism by interfering with the vitamin K-dependent synthesis of prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X. This process takes 4 to 5 days. The drug has a long half-life, and its activity is enhanced or blunted by many chemicals. The effective treatment of thromboembolism with heparin, followed by warfarin, requires a basic understanding of the complex pharmacologic aspects and drug interactions.\r"

Three of five patients eventually died, one 2 weeks after resolution of candida esophagitis from a hypoglycemic episode, one from acute exacerbation of pulmonary failure and relapsing pancreatitis in association with candida esophagitis and therapy-resistant candidemia, and one 17 months after candida esophagitis from pulmonary edema.

Bacteria determinations were performed at operation and at sacrifice. Endotoxin levels were determined three times and prostaglandin levels, twice daily in portal and central venous blood. In the pigs with small bowel obstruction, greatly increased microflora with a predominance of E. coli bacteria was observed in the obstructed bowel. Endotoxin measurements proved general release into the circulation, with potentially toxic levels in the systemic circulation arising relatively late on the fourth postobstruction day. Beginning on the first postobstruction day, stimulation of the prostaglandin system occurred which was initially limited to the gastrointestinal tract but spread systemically when the obstruction persisted for more than 5 days. Vasoactive eicosanoids were predominantly involved. The control animals showed none of the alterations seen in the animals with small bowel obstruction.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the safety, efficacy, and the ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide (CO2) of mini-dose intrathecal morphine, 33 healthy women who underwent cesarean section with spinal anesthesia using 0.75% bupivacaine in 8.25% dextrose were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to receive, in a double-blind fashion, either morphine 0.25 mg (group I, n = 11), morphine 0.1 mg (group II, n = 10), or saline (group III, placebo group, n = 12) in 0.5 ml volume mixed with the bupivacaine. In both groups I and II excellent postoperative analgesia with long duration was obtained (27.7 +/- 4.0 and 18.6 +/- 0.9 hours, respectively, X +/- SEM). All patients in group III required an analgesic (8 mg subcutaneous morphine) within 3 hours of spinal anesthesia. Seven patients in group I and four patients in group II developed mild pruritus that did not require treatment. Ventilatory responses to CO2 showed no evidence of depression attributable to either the 0.25 or 0.1 mg of morphine, but significant depression of the CO2 responses was observed in group III patients after administration of subcutaneous morphine. It is concluded that a dose as low as 0.1 mg of intrathecal morphine gives excellent analgesia with minimal to no side effects and that subcutaneous morphine is associated with marked depression of the ventilatory variables.\r"

Positive end-expiratory pressure was increased from 0 (baseline) to 20 cm H2O in 5-cm H2O increments and RV hemodynamics and thermally derived right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI), and right ventricular end-systolic volume index (RVESVI) were computed. Right ventricular contractility was determined from the analysis of RV systolic pressure-volume relations. Right ventricular ejection fraction declined from 42 +/- 8% at baseline to 30 +/- 9% at 20 cm H2O PEEP. Right ventricular end-diastolic volume index declined between 0 and 5 cm H2O PEEP (103 +/- 42 to 92 +/- 34 ml.m-2) and then increased to 113 +/- 40 at 20 cm H2O PEEP. Right ventricular end-systolic volume index increased from 60 +/- 31 ml.m-2 at baseline to 79 +/- 34 ml.m-2 at 20 cm H2O PEEP. The slope (E) of the relation of RV peak systolic pressure to RV end-systolic volume index decreased from 0.26 mm Hg.m2.ml-1 between PEEP of 0-15 cm H2O to 0.05 mm Hg.m2.m-1 at PEEP greater than 15 cm H2O. It is concluded that low levels of PEEP have a predominant preload reducing effect on the RV. Above 15 cm H2O PEEP, RV volumes increase and E decreases, consistent with increased RV afterload and a decline in RV contractility.\r"

  ".W": "A number of cardiac arrests and severe hypotensive episodes have been witnessed associated with the intravenous infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). To clarify the possible role of hypocalcemia, 28 thermally injured anesthetized pediatric patients with massive blood loss were studied to examine the cardiovascular responses (mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate, ECG) to 49 infusions of FFP. Rapid, statistically significant reductions in ionized calcium ([Ca2+]) followed each of four rates (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 ml.kg-1.min-1 for 5 minutes) of FFP infusion (P less than 0.0001). The slowest rate resulted in significantly less reduction in [Ca2+] than did the higher infusion rates (P less than 0.002). In five children MAP decreased greater than or equal to 20% below baseline levels, but this was not correlated with rate of FFP administration or decrease in [Ca2+]. The decreases in [Ca2+] and MAP were inversely related to age and unrelated to anesthetic technique. Changes in the Q-oTc interval were not related to [Ca2+]. Adverse cardiovascular responses and reduced [Ca2+] were not significantly different between 5- and 10-minute FFP infusions. Fewer fluctuations in MAP occurred when calcium chloride (CaCl2) was administered; the least fluctuation in [Ca2+] occurred when CaCl2 was administered during the plasma infusion. It is concluded that in thermally injured children 1-17 years old: 1) Rapid infusions of FFP produce sudden but evanescent decreases in [Ca2+]; more rapid infusions result in greater reductions in [Ca2+]. 2) There is no correlation between [Ca2+] and systemic hypotension. 3) Clinically important decreases in MAP occasionally accompany the rapid infusion of FFP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of oral atropine premedication in attenuation of the cardiovascular depression associated with halothane anesthesia has not been previously evaluated. A solution containing either oral atropine 0.04 mg/kg (HI), 0.02 mg/kg (LO), or a placebo (NO) was randomly administered to 36 infants 1-6 months old and 36 infants 7-15 months old 30-90 minutes before induction of anesthesia. The onset of action of atropine was approximately 25 minutes after administration as determined by a 15% increase in heart rate (HR) above baseline levels. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were then measured at 1-minute intervals starting just before induction of anesthesia and continuing until onset of surgical stimulation during anesthesia with halothane (up to 3%), nitrous oxide (60%), and oxygen (40%). In infants 1-6 months old, either dosage of oral atropine preserved HR and SBP as compared with placebo. In infants 7-15 months old, either dosage preserved HR but not SBP. The severity of hypotension was greatest in infants 1-6 months of age given placebos. No significant differences existed between oral atropine 0.04 mg/kg or 0.02 mg/kg in either age range. It is concluded that premedication with oral atropine 0.02 mg/kg is effective in attenuating the cardiovascular depression associated with halothane anesthesia in infants.\r"

Eleven patients responded to ketanserin with a decrease of arterial pressure from 159 +/- 15/83 +/- 10 mm Hg to 131 +/- 9/70 +/- 12 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), which was sustained during the subsequent infusion of ketanserin. Mean plasma ketanserin concentrations were maintained at 187 micrograms/L (range 118-525). No significant changes in plasma levels of 5-hydroxyindoles or in platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine content were observed during or after CPB, or after administration of ketanserin. Plasma epinephrine (398 +/- 124 pg/ml) and norepinephrine (1161 +/- 673 pg/ml) concentrations were markedly increased during the hypertensive period after CPB. Plasma epinephrine concentrations decreased (P less than 0.01) during ketanserin infusion to 213 +/- 101 pg/ml, whereas plasma norepinephrine concentrations did not change. The pressor response to three graded doses of phenylephrine was decreased during CPB (P less than 0.01), and a further decrease (P less than 0.05) occurred during infusion of ketanserin. The hypotensive effect of ketanserin after CPB may be attributable to alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade rather than to its antiserotoninergic effect. Serotonin does not appear to be involved in the short-term disturbances of arterial pressure during or after CPB.\r"

A trained observer recorded all intraoperative hypoxic episodes and informed the anesthesia team of all major events (i.e., oxygen saturation less than or equal to 85% for greater than or equal to 30 s) (PaO2 approximately 52 mmHg). Thirty-five major events occurred: 24 in the unavailable group, and 11 in the available group (P = 0.021). A greater number of major events occurred in children less than or equal to 2 yr of age (P = 0.013).

The pulse oximeter diagnosed hypoxemia before the signs and symptoms of hypoxemia were apparent (i.e., prior to observed cyanosis or bradycardia). Major hypoxic events were unrelated to duration of anesthesia.

Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 100 micrograms/kg and atracurium 0.50 mg/kg administered over 10 min. The treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to the degree of sedation or anxiolysis achieved, or the rapidity of induction with fentanyl. Premedication significantly influenced the hemodynamic response to anesthetic induction. Hemodynamics were stable post-induction in group M, but cardiovascular depression was noted in group L. Control heart rate (HR) was lower in group L. The HR, arterial pressure, and cardiac index were significantly lower, following both induction and intubation, in group L. Following sternotomy hemodynamics were identical in both groups. Serum fentanyl concentration was significantly higher during intubation in group L, probably secondary to the pharmacokinetic consequences of a decreased CI. New electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia did not occur in either group. Based on their findings with fentanyl-at-racurium, and their review of the literature, the authors speculate that premedication exerts a significant hemodynamic effect during induction with other narcotic-relaxant combinations.\r"

  ".W": "The authors anesthetized 18 patients with good pulmonary and ventricular function for coronary artery bypass grafting with high doses of fentanyl. When the patients were arousable and their vital signs stable in the intensive care unit, the authors administered nalbuphine or placebo (randomly and double-blinded) until extubation criteria were met, and subsequently gave nalbuphine for analgesia. In one of ten placebo patients, tracheal extubation was accomplished without nalbuphine. This patient then retained CO2 and required nalbuphine; the other nine placebo patients could not be extubated after placebo trials and were given nalbuphine. In all other patients in both groups, tracheal extubation was successful following nalbuphine (median dose 60 micrograms/kg, range 30-180 micrograms/kg). One patient became renarcotized 4 h after tracheal extubation without an increase in plasma fentanyl concentration; he received an additional dose of nalbuphine and recovered without further incident. Nine patients required treatment with vasoactive agents or beta-blockers for hypertension or tachycardia associated with the administration of nalbuphine. Eight of 18 patients were not satisfied with nalbuphine analgesia, and required morphine for relief of their pain. Recurrent elevations of fentanyl concentrations in plasma were observed and appeared to be related to increasing motor activity. Nalbuphine is an effective opioid antagonist after fentanyl anesthesia, but its use is associated with side effects, and analgesia for the post-sternotomy patient may be unsatisfactory unless the dose is carefully titrated to the minimum required to antagonize respiratory depression.\r"

In some whose hypertension is related to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone control system, appropriate antirenin therapy is effective. Recent studies indicate that calcium ions may play a special role in the etiology of low-renin essential hypertension. Specific abnormalities in calcium and magnesium metabolism which are related to deviations in the renin system have been identified. Antihypertensive therapy with calcium antagonist drugs such as nitrendipine appears to be most effective in patients with low levels of renin activity and serum ionized calcium. These observations support the concept of the heterogeneity of human hypertension and could represent a significant step towards more specific antihypertensive drug therapy.\r"

Most side effects were mild and were tolerated or disappeared with continued therapy. No serious adverse biochemical, hemodynamic, renal, or humoral effects of nitrendipine were apparent. Nitrendipine produced a prompt, smooth, and sustained reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both the supine and standing positions. The blood pressure response was maintained for six months to one year with no evidence of resistance or tachyphylaxis.

Ca2+ channels are stabilized by these drugs in a mode unavailable for opening. The inhibition of Ca2+ entry leads to vasodilatation and lowering of arterial pressure. The advantages of Ca2+ channel antagonists in hypertension include improvement of blood supply to vital organs, diuretic activity, coronary vasodilatation, reduction in heart size and vascular cytoprotective effect.\r"

  ".W": "At the present time there are three commercially available intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations. There is no distinct therapeutic advantage for any one product over any other. Intravenous immunoglobulin is currently approved for the treatment of antibody deficiency syndromes and for acute and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. In addition, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of Kawasaki disease and for the prevention of the following infections: sepsis in preterm neonates, sepsis in infants with AIDS, and cytomegalovirus infection in the immune-compromised host. Open (uncontrolled) studies have suggested benefit in the treatment of neonatal sepsis, chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection, and a number of autoimmune diseases. Additional carefully designed studies must be completed before IVIG therapy can be recommended for these latter categories. In published reports, dosage of IVIG and intervals between infusions have varied considerably. For all current indications, the physician must therefore individualize treatment and thoroughly review any recent literature that may clarify guidelines to IVIG therapy. Significant adverse reactions are rare but high cost remains the main obstacle to more routine implementation.\r"

We questioned whether an inhaled bronchodilator such as isoproterenol would benefit patients with COPD by inhibiting inducible bronchoconstriction. Ten patients with COPD were found to be more sensitive to methacholine by inhalation bronchial challenge testing than were normal control subjects. (PD35 = 58 +/- 110 versus 238 +/- 220 cumulative dose units). Neither group as a whole demonstrated significant inhibition of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction by prior inhalation of isoproterenol (200 micrograms at mouth). However, within the COPD group, there was a significant negative correlation between both baseline lung function and airway responsiveness (PD35-SGaw) with inhibition of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. (r = -0.8, p less than or equal to 0.003). This suggests that those patients with COPD and significantly reduced lung function (%FEV1 less than 50%) demonstrate airway hyperresponsiveness to a degree recorded in asthma and may benefit from therapy that inhibits airway responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the relationship between lower respiratory illness (LRI) experience in early childhood and lung function and bronchial reactivity in 57 boys, 11 to 22 yr of age, whose histories of outpatient physician visits for wheezing and nonwheezing LRI had been documented prospectively during their first 6 yr of life. These boys were a subpopulation of 159 children whose early childhood LRI experience and spirometric performance had been studied an average of 4 yr previously. The majority of boys had been free of chronic respiratory symptoms in the 2 yr before evaluation. Boys with histories of 2 or more preschool wheezing illnesses had lower mean levels of performance for FEV1, FEF25-75, FEF50, FEF75, and FEV1/FVC than did boys who had zero or 1 preschool wheezing illness, replicating observations that had been made when the boys had been studied 4 yr previously. Boys with lower spirometric performance relative to the study population on initial testing continued to have lower relative levels of spirometric performance 4 yr later. Neither preschool wheezing nor nonwheezing illness experience was associated with the degree of methacholine sensitivity measured in adolescence. Increasing degrees of methacholine sensitivity were associated with lower levels of spirometric performance; however, preschool wheezing illness experience remained a significant correlate of spirometric performance after adjustment for level of methacholine sensitivity. We conclude that recurrent preschool wheezing illness in these adolescent boys was associated with persistently lower lung function, but not enhanced methacholine sensitivity, during the middle to late school years.\r"

  ".W": "We compared indices of muscle strength, parameters of mechanical lung function, and static pressure-volume curves in 12 heart-lung transplant (HLT) recipients to determine whether observed restrictive ventilatory defects represented abnormal elastic behavior of the transplanted lungs. Pressure-volume curves were analyzed using an exponential equation to generate the shape constant K, which describes the nonlinear behavior of pressure-volume relationships over a substantial range. For the group, K was 91% predicted, implying that there was not a diffuse abnormality of elastic properties of the transplanted lungs despite a mean TLC of 80% predicted. However, the mean maximal transpulmonary pressure (PLmax) was significantly low at 23.4 cm H2O (61% predicted) possibly related to the effects of surgery on thoracic cage mobility, but also in keeping with a reduction in power and efficiency of the thoracic musculature. The ability to achieve predicted TLC post-HLT was related to the preservation of optimal inspiratory force as TLC (% predicted) was highly correlated with maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) (% predicted) (r = 0.83) (p less than 0.001). The ratio (TLC post-HLT)/(TLC pre-HLT) was 1.00 +/- 0.18 (r = 0.82) (p less than 0.005), suggesting donor organs were well matched to recipient chest cavities, but also emphasizing that the recipients had a low TLC prior to HLT. We conclude that the presence of a stable restrictive defect post-HLT is determined primarily by the volumetric constraints of the recipient chest cavity and within these constraints by the strength and efficiency of the thoracic musculature rather than a diffuse intrinsic abnormality of pulmonary elastic properties as a consequence of the transplantation process.\r"

The decreases in pulmonary conductance and dynamic compliance caused by substance P were greater in animals treated with either thiorphan or captopril than in control animals. Thiorphan (0.5 mg) had no effect on airway responsiveness to intravenously administered methacholine, whereas captopril (1.7 mg) caused a small increase in methacholine responsiveness. Both drugs significantly increased the recovery of immunoreactive substance P in arterial plasma after exogenous administration of the peptide. We conclude that degradation of substance P by both NEP and ACE is important for determining the magnitude of the bronchoconstriction caused by intravenous administration of this neuropeptide. These data suggest that conditions associated with diminished peptidase activity could result in enhanced responses to stimuli which cause the release of endogenous substance P.\r"

  ".W": "The major 28,000- to 36,000-dalton proteins of pulmonary surfactant (SP28-36) have been shown by various techniques to be synthetic and secretory products of alveolar type II cells. Surfactant lipids are also secreted by these cells. Immunocytochemical studies of human and rodent lungs have indicated that nonciliated epithelial cells of small bronchioles appear to contain SP28-36 in their synthetic organelles and secretory granules. Because these observations were obtained with polyclonal antibodies against SP28-36, it was possible that bronchiolar cell staining was due to contaminant antibodies not detected by biochemical analyses. To clarify the role of bronchiolar cells in the metabolism of SP28-36, we have prepared 5 monoclonal antibodies against canine SP28-36. Electrophoresis and immunoblots of surfactant showed that each antibody reacted with SP32 and 36, as well as SP28, the nonglycosylated species. This indicates that the antibodies are directed against the protein rather than carbohydrate moieties of SP28-36. Immunoblot analysis of collagenase-treated SP28-36 showed that the antibodies DS-3 and DS-1 were directed against the noncollagen region of the protein. Immunoblot analysis of whole canine lung homogenates showed that a single protein species was recognized by the antibodies. Immunofluorescence studies of cryostat sections of canine lung showed that both type II and nonciliated bronchiolar cells were specifically labeled with each antibody. These and previous data are consistent with and support the idea that bronchiolar cells synthesize and secrete SP28-36.\r"

  ".W": "Langerhans' cells are a defined subpopulation of the mononuclear phagocyte system known to accumulate in the lung in histiocytosis X, an interstitial lung disorder strongly linked to cigarette smoking. To evaluate the hypothesis that cigarette smoking itself may be associated with the accumulation of Langerhans' cells in the lung, normal nonsmokers (n = 5) and normal smokers (n = 10) were evaluated by bronchoalveolar lavage for the presence of Langerhans' cells as identified by the OKT6 monoclonal antibody and by transmission electron microscopy. While the OKT6 antibody identified 0.1 +/- 0.1% of the cells recovered from nonsmokers, it labeled 1.1 +/- 0.3% of those recovered from smokers (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, while electron microscopy demonstrated no Langerhans' cells among the lavage cells from nonsmokers, 0.4 +/- 0.1% of the cells recovered from normal smokers contained characteristic intracytoplasmic Birbeck granules, positively identifying them as Langerhans' cells. We conclude that cigarette smoking is associated with an expansion in the population of Langerhans' cells on the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract. While the mechanisms underlying this accumulation are unknown, it is possible that the properties of these cells contribute to the derangements of the pulmonary parenchyma found in cigarette smoking and establish a biologic link to the already observed epidemiologic association between histiocytosis X and cigarette smoking.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of endotoxin intravenously to unanesthetized sheep causes an acute lung injury characterized by increased microvascular barrier permeability and subsequent pulmonary edema. Endotoxin-induced sheep lung injury can be attenuated by leukocyte depletion, and may be mediated by toxic metabolites of oxygen. We studied effects of administering catalase, which catalyzes conversion of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, to sheep subsequently infused with endotoxin to test the hypothesis that hydrogen peroxide plays a role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. We found that infusions of endotoxin (1 microgram/kg) into untreated sheep caused the expected biphasic response, a transient, early, marked pulmonary arterial hypertension followed by a prolonged increase in protein-rich lung lymph flow characteristic of increased microvascular permeability filtration in the lungs. Intraperitoneal injections of catalase (50 mg/kg) prior to infusing endotoxin in these same sheep resulted in substantial catalase activity in plasma and in lung lymph, and attenuated the expected changes in pulmonary arterial pressure, lung lymph flow, and arterial leukocyte counts and oxygen tension after endotoxin infusions. Furthermore, mechanical elevation of hydrostatic pressure in the lungs of a catalase-treated sheep infused with endotoxin resulted in increased lung lymph flow with a decreased protein concentration, indicating that the microvascular barrier to fluid and protein was functionally intact. Administration of catalase that was inactivated by reaction with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aminotriazole or administration of the catalase vehicle, thymol, had no effects on the sheep responses to endotoxin. We conclude that hydrogen peroxide plays a role in the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury in sheep.\r"

  ".W": "Although malignant sessile colorectal polyps usually require colectomy for proper treatment, the majority of malignant pedunculated polyps can be removed colonoscopically. A polyp is considered malignant if the proliferating cells have penetrated the muscularis mucosa. Total excisional biopsy is necessary to properly assess an adenoma microscopically. Forceps biopsy is inadequate. Virtually all malignant pedunculated polyps can be removed colonoscopically, provided one can reach the lesion, and provided one is experienced with snare electro-surgical techniques. Certain sessile polyps can also be removed colonoscopically, if the lesion is soft and nonulcerated, and if one is familiar with piecemeal polypectomy technique developed by Shinya. If the adenoma is malignant, special attention microscopically must be given to the margin of transection, to the specimen's lymphatics, and to the degree of differentiation of the malignancy. If the margin transection and lymphatics are free of tumor cells, if the malignancy is well differentiated, and if follow-up endoscopic exam reveals no residual or recurrence at the polypectomy site (i.e., Morson criteria), the malignant polyp can be considered cured by colonscopic polypectomy alone. The author's experience with 106 consecutively encountered malignant colorectal polyps over a 10 year period is reviewed. Sixty two lesions were removed by colonscopic polypectomy alone. All patients in this group have done well, except for one patient who had tumor involvement at the margin of polyp transection, who was considered inoperable because of severe medical problems, and who died from hepatic metatases 5 months later. Forty four patients underwent colectomy; 26 of these colectomies were preceded by colonoscopic polypectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lymphoproliferative syndrome occurred between 50 and 60 days after bone marrow infusion, and was diagnosed by the presence of spontaneously growing B cells containing Epstein-Barr-nuclear antigen in the blood and bone marrow. The mouse monoclonal anti-B-cell antibodies used were a CD21-specific antibody recognizing the CR2 receptor on B cells (BL13, IgG1) and a CD24-specific antibody binding B cells at all steps of differentiation (ALB9 IgG1). Both antibodies were given intravenously (0.2 mg/kg/body weight.d for 10 days). All clinical and biological manifestations resolved within 3 weeks of treatment. Recurrence was not seen at 18- and 15-month follow-ups. T-cell function developed normally; B-cell function remained partially deficient in one patient 21 months after bone marrow transplantation. These results suggest that monoclonal anti-B-cell antibodies could be useful in controlling severe polyclonal lymphoproliferative syndrome in profoundly immunodeficient patients after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

The molecular biology of the virus is being unraveled with the aid of new molecular technologies. Varicella, usually a benign manifestation of primary infection, and zoster, a result of reactivation of latent virus, can cause considerable morbidity in patients with immune impairment. Antiviral drugs, especially acyclovir, ameliorate severe infections but still have little role in the treatment of most normal patients with varicella or zoster. Varicella can be prevented when necessary by patient isolation and passive prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin. An experimental live vaccine also prevents varicella, but problems regarding its virulence for immunosuppressed patients and the durability of the protective response are still being addressed.\r"

The drug antagonizes DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for bacterial DNA replication. Norfloxacin is more potent and broader in spectrum than the earlier developed analogue, nalidixic acid, and is active in vitro against virtually all bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections, aerobic gram-negative bacilli causing sepsis in neutropenic patients, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The drug is administered orally twice daily and achieves high concentrations in urine, stool, renal tissue, and bile. Norfloxacin was at least as effective as currently used agents in treating urinary tract infections, and, in limited studies, bacterial gastroenteritis, gonorrhea, bacterial prostatitis, and prevention of gram-negative bacillary infection in neutropenic patients. Adverse drug effects were mild and included disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Norfloxacin shows promise as an antibacterial agent for genitourinary and gastrointestinal infections.\r"

Young women (nine of ten) with knowledge of the medical profession or relatives with diabetes mellitus predominated in the sample. Five of the patients had a history of insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus. Two patients eventually committed suicide despite the best efforts at therapy. Only three of ten patients made a successful transition into productive life after the diagnosis of factitious hypoglycemia was established. Factitious hypoglycemia remains a difficult diagnosis to make, and the long-term outcome after the diagnosis is established is unpredictable. All efforts have to be made to confirm the diagnosis before the patients are approached. The confrontation is to be made by an experienced team of health care professionals who have gained the patient's confidence through an understanding but firm manner. Long-term therapy must be planned and initiated before the patient's discharge.\r"

We found HIV antigens in monocyte-macrophages and endothelial cells within the submucosa of three of these cervices by specific immunohistochemical staining. Small numbers of HIV-infected cells resembling lymphocytes also were found in the cervical mucosa. The virus was not shown by culture or immunohistochemistry in cervical biopsy specimens from the four HIV-seronegative women. These findings suggest that HIV enters cervical secretions from selected infected cell populations within the cervical tissue. The HIV-infected cells in cervical tissue may be involved in transmission of HIV by heterosexual contact and to neonates born to HIV-infected women.\r"

It usually presents at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis. There is evidence of an etiologic role for hepatitis B virus infection in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma. Carriers of the virus are 94 times more at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma than noncarriers. In many cases hepatitis B virus DNA is integrated within the cellular genome of the tumor. Programs have been established to detect hepatocellular carcinoma at an early stage; persons at high risk are regularly screened by measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and ultrasound examination of the liver. Surgical resection offers the only hope of cure at present, as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy have not shown promise. Ideally, surgery should be done on small asymptomatic tumors.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of demonstrated clinical efficacy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the central nervous system. DESIGN: Information synthesis of studies before January 1987. SETTING: Reports were classified by the level of clinical efficacy studied (technical capacity, diagnostic impacts, and therapeutic or patient outcome impacts) and were judged by the validity of their methods, especially avoidance of diagnosis review, test review, and work-up biases. MAIN RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging probably is superior to computed tomography for detection and characterization of posterior fossa lesions and spinal cord myelopathies, imaging in multiple sclerosis, detecting lesions in patients with refractory partial seizures, and detailed display for guiding complex therapy, as for brain tumors. In other diseases, the efficacy of MR imaging is similar to that of computed tomography (cerebrovascular, radiculopathy, and infection). Magnetic resonance imaging is less invasive than intrathecal or intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography and costs 20% to 300% more than computed tomography, although avoidance of hospital stays may offset some costs. Generally, the quality of MR images probably exceeds that of computed tomographic (CT) scans. However, published evidence does not show that the clinical efficacy of MR imaging is generally superior to that of existing imaging modalities such as computed tomography. Only six studies avoided major methodologic biases, and lower true-positive rates for MR imaging were reported in these studies than reported in multiply biased studies. Few studies of the potential of MR imaging for false-positive diagnosis have been done. CONCLUSIONS: Use of standards for quality of evidence leads to more conservative conclusions than those of reports describing the clinical potential of MR imaging. Some applications of MR imaging were confirmed by rigorous studies, whereas others were not well supported by reports free of methodologic biases. If the diagnostic alternative is invasive (for example, myelography and cisternography), MR imaging is preferred, but adequate diagnosis for many conditions (head trauma, simple stroke, and dementia) may not require the detail of an MR imaging study. In general, more rigorous clinical research studies are needed for new technologies such as MR imaging. Because the field of MR imaging is changing, review of its clinical efficacy will need to be revised frequently.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary hypertension may develop whenever chronic obstruction of pulmonary arterial blood flow occurs. Although repeated pulmonary embolism is thought to be the usual underlying cause, there is little clinical evidence to support this theory. Studies of the pulmonary vascular endothelium have shown that perturbations of the normal endothelium can create a procoagulant environment, which could lead to the development of thrombosis in situ at the level of the large or smaller pulmonary vessels. Some patients develop proximal pulmonary thromboemboli, which may be the result of retrograde propagation of thrombus after an initial pulmonary embolus. Others present with unexplained pulmonary hypertension secondary to thrombotic occlusion of the pulmonary microvasculature. A perfusion lung scan will show abnormalities that should lead to correct clinical diagnosis and confirmatory evaluation. Thromboendarterectomy in selected cases provides dramatic clinical improvement in patients with proximal thromboemboli. Vasodilators may be effective in some patients with obstruction at the arteriolar level. Both groups should be treated with chronic warfarin anticoagulant therapy to protect against progression of thromboembolism.\r"

We compared the clinicians' reasoning with a decision analysis of the same problem. The experts did not formulate a global outline of their decision, but chained together a sequence of decisions based on available and incomplete information. Despite effective and efficient problem solving, the clinicians used numeric terms only as symbolic representations of likelihood, used limited information in choosing among alternatives, and dismissed the possibility that a less conventional strategy, empiric therapy, might yield equivalent outcome. We describe cognitive problem-solving strategies and knowledge representations that permit persons to make successful decisions despite limited processing resources. The same cognitive procedures probably contribute to observed errors in decision-making under uncertainty.\r"

Recently, important advances have been made in two technologies for the study of cochlear blood flow. The first is in the area of vital microscopic studies of cochlear microcirculation, and the second is based on the introduction of laser technology in the form of laser Doppler flowmetry. In this report, measurements are given of changes in cochlear circulation caused by carbon dioxide breathing, intravenous phenylephrine injection, systemic hemodilution, positive end expiratory pressure, and direct electrical stimulation of the cochlea. From these changes, we observe that cochlear blood circulation responds to systemic blood pressure alterations and is subject to local flow control mechanisms. Linearity and speed of response of the laser Doppler instrumentation also are shown. These advances show promise for contributing to our knowledge of control mechanisms of inner ear blood flow and for revealing the influence of various pharmacologic agents of potential clinical value.\r"

In addition, we report ten cases of our own, two with successful hearing preservation. The purpose of this report is to study feasibility, success rate, and associated problems. Previous reports have been compared in terms of criteria that we have selected. A classification system similar to Silverstein's is used. The total number of cases under review is 621, with 221 reported successes. Cases limited to those having a unilateral acoustic neuroma, with valid supportive audiometry, were 394, with 131 successes. The approximate overall rate of success is 33%. There are five cases of hearing preservation with unilateral acoustic neuromas 3 cm or larger when supporting audiometric data are available, the largest being \"4-5 centimeters.\" Problems included mixing of unilateral acoustic neuromas with other types of tumors and failure to include comprehensive data, particularly audiometry. We conclude 1) that hearing preservation is a reasonable goal in unilateral acoustic neuroma surgery, although the number of available candidates is relatively small and 2) that intelligent selection of patients and high quality surgical technique are the keys to success.\r"

Because of the lack of response to treatment with reasonably high doses of oral corticosteroids, as well as the very high titer of circulating autoantibodies observed, this patient was treated with intravenous corticosteroid pulse therapy followed by plasmapheresis and then by combination immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone and azathioprine). A rapid clinical response was induced, correlating with reduction and subsequent elimination of the circulating pemphigus autoantibodies. Using such combination therapy, a remission of 12 months was achieved, and prednisone therapy was completely, albeit temporarily, tapered and then discontinued. Subsequent disease flare was then easily controlled with a short course of low-dose oral corticosteroid therapy.\r"

Routine histologic and immunofluorescence mapping studies demonstrated this disorder to be a relatively noninflammatory one characterized by sub-lamina densa blister formation. Results of direct immunofluorescence were negative. By electron microscopy, anchoring fibrils were sparse in number and in some areas appeared malformed; otherwise, the basement membrane zone was morphologically unremarkable. Bullous pemphigoid antigen, laminin, type IV collagen, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen, and LDA-1 were all normally expressed along the dermoepidermal junction. In contrast, KF-1 antigen was absent. These findings suggest a disease process confined to skin graft recipient sites with features identical to those previously described with recessive dystrophic or immunofluorescence-negative acquired epidermolysis bullosa.\r"

The significance of this study is that it describes a large, relatively homogeneous population and analyzes what the state of the art for liver trauma has been in a center dedicated solely to trauma that has a full-time staff of trained traumatologists. Three hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with blunt liver trauma are presented, representing 3.5% of 9271 patients admitted to the institute over the period of this study. Ninety per cent had associated traumatic injuries requiring operative intervention. A mortality rate of 31% (101 patients) was noted; 41.5% of the deaths, due primarily to liver injury, occurred intraoperatively during the initial operation following admission. The use of simple suture techniques and resectional debridement to control hemorrhage are advocated. Anatomic lobectomy, intracaval shunting, and hepatic artery ligation were uniformly unsuccessful. The use of drains was associated with a significantly increased incidence of infectious complications (p less than 0.00002).\r"

In early dumpers subcutaneous administration of 50 micrograms SMS 201-995 prior to meal ingestion induced a strong improvement of dumping symptoms as reflected by a decrease of the Sigstad dumping score from 12 +/- 2 during placebo to 5 +/- 2 (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, the postprandial increase of pulse rate was abolished; maximum pulse rate decreased from 85 +/- 7 beats/min to 67 +/- 7 beats/min (p less than 0.05). SMS 201-995 did not significantly affect postprandial changes in packed cell volume. In late dumpers 50 micrograms SMS 201-995 reduced peak plasma insulin after oral glucose from 173 +/- 16 mU/L during placebo to 35 +/- 9 mU/L during SMS 201-995 (p less than 0.05) and increased individual plasma glucose nadirs from 1.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/L to 7.5 +/- 3.3 mmol/L (p less than 0.01). Both in early and late dumpers SMS 201-995 improved postprandial expiratory breath hydrogen excretion indicating slowing of gastrointestinal hurry.

All patients had preoperative radiographic imaging studies and selective venous sampling for hormones, which guided the subsequent laparotomy. Any suspicious finding by palpation and/or IOUS was resected. Pathologic evidence of islet cell neoplasm served as the reference standard. Five patients were excluded from analysis because neither palpation nor IOUS had suspicious findings and no islet cell tumor was found. Seven pancreatic insulinomas were found in seven patients. IOUS was as sensitive as palpation at localizing insulinomas. Twenty-three pancreatic gastrinomas were found in 19 patients. IOUS was equal to palpation in the ability to localize gastrinomas. Gastrinomas that were successfully imaged by IOUS were significantly larger than gastrinomas that were not imaged. Twelve extrapancreatic gastrinomas were found in nine patients, and palpation was more sensitive than IOUS at localizing these small duodenal wall tumors. Five patients (11%) had their surgical management changed by IOUS. Two patients had pancreatic tumors (one gastrinoma and insulinoma) enucleated that would not have been found without IOUS, and three patients had resections of pathologically proven malignant islet cell tumors based on sonographic findings. All five patients were cured with short follow-up. The present results demonstrate that palpation and IOUS are complementary because IOUS can image tumors that are not palpable and IOUS can provide additional information concerning malignant potential not detected by palpation.\r"

This tumor continues to pose problems in diagnosis and effective treatment for physicians unfamiliar with its biological characteristics. Reported here are five additional cases of NCS and the literature for this rare neoplasm is comprehensively reviewed. An early and accurate diagnosis is made possible by combining clinical presentation with results of histologic study, immunoperoxidase staining for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratins, and electron microscopy. NCS is an aggressive tumor. Depending on the length of follow-up, up to 40% of tumors locally recur, 55% develop regional nodal metastases, and 36% undergo distant metastasis. Survival is sex, but not age, dependent, with an overall 2-year survival rate of 72% (males 58% vs. females 79%). No standard procedure for initial and/or follow-up treatment for NCS exists. The authors recommend that NCS be treated, whenever possible, using the same rationale as applied for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\r"

Selective ascending functional phlebography and superficial phlebography were used to assess the anatomic extension of the lesions and to evaluate the functional status of the involved extremity: 14 patients had only SVS angiodysplasia, in 10 patients additional pathologic features of the deep veins (DV) were found. Venous reflux was demonstrated in 16 patients and significant venous insufficiency was detected in five patients. The patients were classified into three groups according to the severity of the disease: mild (11 patients), moderate (8 patients), and severe (5 patients). The prognostic and the long-term outcome of surgical treatment can be predicted by the depth and the extension of the angiodysplastic lesions.\r"

In the current study testicular volume and seminal variables were evaluated in three groups: young varicocele patients with undetermined fertility potential, infertile varicocele patients, and a control group of young males. The testicular volume was determined by ultrasonographic measurements. The results revealed a significant loss of \"testicular mass\" in both varicocele groups compared with the control group. The seminal findings disclosed a severe disturbance of spermatogenesis in the older varicocele group, whereas in the younger varicocele patients only the total spermatic count was significantly depressed. This difference in severity of functional impairment between the younger and older varicocele groups possibly points towards progressiveness of damage to the testicles. A more decisive therapeutic approach to the young male with asymptomatic varicocele and unknown fertility status could be justified.\r"

The Texas Heart Institute modified this policy of using age as a contraindication to transplantation. Between July, 1982, and August, 1987, a total of 200 cardiac transplants were performed, 28 (14%) of which were in patients over 60 years of age, the eldest being 66 years old at the time of transplant. Our immunosuppressive regimen consisted primarily of cyclosporine and prednisone. In 1985, azathioprine was added in an effort to decrease dosages of cyclosporine, thereby decreasing its associated nephrotoxicity. The incidences of rejection and infection were 1.2 and 1.4 episodes/patient, respectively, for those over 60 years of age versus 1.7 and 1.3 episodes/patient, respectively, for those less than 60 years of age. Of the 28 patients, 23 are alive and well. Four deaths were caused by infection, and the other by diffuse coronary arteritis. The one-year actuarial survival for patients over 60 years of age was 83%, compared with 75% for the other transplant patients. We conclude that persons over 60 years of age can undergo cardiac transplantation with results equal to or perhaps better than those of other heart transplant patients. Our experience suggests that advanced age should not be considered a major contraindication to cardiac transplantation.\r"

Mechanical staplers and a cervical anastomosis have been emphasized to avoid catastrophic consequences of anastomotic leaks in the chest. Transhiatal esophagectomy has been proposed to bring the anastomosis into the neck. It is meant to be a palliative procedure and consequently denies the patient the best chance for surgical cure. The emphasis should be on anastomotic technique and sound principles of surgical oncology. Since 1980, we have performed 104 esophagectomies for carcinoma of the esophagus. We used a left thoracoabdominal incision for distal tumors (64) and the Ivor Lewis technique (40) for more proximal tumors. A two-layer inverting interrupted silk suture technique was used for all anastomoses. More than 90% of the procedures were performed by resident staff. The operative mortality was 2.9% (3 patients). There were no anastomotic leaks. Five patients required between one dilation and three dilations postoperatively. A positive smoking history was present in 83 patients and substantial alcohol use, in 33. Median estimated blood loss was 500 ml, and 60% of patients required no transfusions. Major complications included pneumonia (12 patients) and reexploration for bleeding (2). Minor complications included atelectasis (71 patients), atrial fibrillation (9), ventricular arrhythmias (9), urinary tract infection (3), and wound infection (2). Squamous cancer was present in 31 patients and adenocarcinoma, in 73. Positive lymph node metastases were present in 75%. Anastomotic recurrence was documented in 6 patients. Standard techniques of esophagogastrectomy and a two-layer anastomosis will give excellent results with low mortality and acceptable morbidity.\r"

A Collis-Nissen procedure with dilation of a reflux stricture was performed in 64 adults. The strictures were mild (easily dilated) in 37, moderate (requiring some force to dilate) in 17, and severe (requiring very forceful dilation) in 10. Two strictures were perforated intraoperatively. There was 1 postoperative death, and 4 patients have been lost to follow-up. The remaining 59 patients have been followed from 2 to 120 months (average, 43 months) after operation. Subjectively, reflux is absent in 48 (81%), mild in 4 (7%), moderate in 5 (9%), and severe in 2 (3%). Objectively, intraesophageal pH studies show good or excellent reflux control in 94% at 1 year and 66% at 2 to 5 years. Dysphagia has been eliminated in 71%, is mild in 10%, moderate (requiring occasional dilation) in 12%, and severe (requiring regular dilations) in 7%. The combined Collis-Nissen operation provides good long-term reflux control and relief of dysphagia in most patients with reflux strictures. However, patients with reflux strictures after previous repairs are likely to have unsatisfactory results and may best be managed with resectional therapy. Resection may also ultimately prove to be a better option for patients with more severe strictures.\r"

To test this hypothesis, cervical heterotopic heart transplantations were performed in a group of 6 nonimmunosuppressed dogs and in a group of 9 dogs treated with cyclosporine (N = 3) or cyclosporine and steroids (N = 6). A group (N = 3) having a sham operation was also studied. Serial biopsies of the transplanted hearts were performed. Urinary polyamine levels were measured daily by high-pressure liquid chromatography of urine specimens. Between 2 and 4 days after transplantation, the transplanted hearts of all animals without immunosuppression demonstrated histological rejection. An early increase in putrescine levels and in total urinary polyamine levels was observed in this group. In the treated groups, histological rejection appeared from the second to the eighth day after transplantation. Each episode of rejection occurred from 1 day to 4 days after a significant increase in urinary polyamine levels compared with the preoperative baseline level (p less than 0.01). In contrast, polyamine excretion in 3 dogs after sham operations remained unchanged. Thus, urinary excretion of polyamines increases before the appearance of histological rejection; this suggests that changes in urinary polyamine levels may be a useful marker of cardiac allograft rejection.\r"

Thirty patients underwent other, more complex procedures. Concomitant cardiac procedures were performed in altogether 25%. Overall hospital (30 days) mortality was 5.1% (3.6% for AVR, 4.3% for MVR, 8.3% for DVR, and 16.6% for other procedures). The patients were followed up at 6- to 9-month intervals from 6 to 48 months (mean follow-up, 33 months). Follow-up was 99.6% complete. Late mortality was 7.2%. The three-year survival rate was 91.0% for AVR, 92.3% for MVR, and 76.2% for DVR. There was no structural failure of the prosthesis. No instances of valve thrombosis and fatal thromboembolism occurred in anticoagulated patients. The three-year incidence of freedom from thromboembolic events (including TIA) was 89.8% for AVR, 94.9% for MVR, and 90.2% for DVR. Preoperative and postoperative data for the assessment of mechanical hemolysis was available in 60% of the patients. The degree of mechanical hemolysis was low and did not change with time. Although the follow-up is still short, the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut prosthesis appears to represent an improvement over previous Bjork-Shiley models, particularly with regard to durability.\r"

All patients required aortic valve replacement because of severely uncoapted cusps secondary to dilatation of the ascending aorta. The right coronary ostium was narrowed in 5 patients and consequently necessitated a smaller coronary tip for the administration of cardioplegic solution. To implant the prosthetic valve, pledgeted 2-0 Tevdek sutures were placed through the aortic valve annulus either from the ventricular side or from outside the aortic wall. Steroids were administered to 4 patients preoperatively and 8 patients postoperatively. Postoperative dehiscence of the prosthesis was seen in 1 of the 3 patients not given any steriods. We conclude that it is important to arrest the inflammatory reaction before operation and if the aortic valve must be replaced, to reinforce the implanted prosthesis with pledgeted sutures. Also, we suggest the possible importance of steroid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Since January, 1985, 59 patients have undergone 62 heart transplantations at Washington University School of Medicine. The experience in this program serves as a useful microcosm of the field of cardiac transplantation as a whole to demonstrate certain trends that are becoming evident. Of the patients, 47% had coronary artery disease compared with 40% with cardiomyopathy. Fourteen patients (24%) were 55 years old or older at the time of transplantation. Sixteen patients (27%) required mechanical support of respiration or circulation or both prior to transplantation. Six patients were maintained with a left ventricular or biventricular assist device, and all survived; 1 patient received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and lived; 7 patients were maintained with an intraaortic balloon pump, 6 of whom survived; and 2 were maintained with a mechanical ventilator and survived. The preoperative waiting period averaged 51 days for the group as a whole. Status-3 patients experienced an average 81-day waiting period, and those in blood group O waited 155 days. In contrast, critically ill patients (status 0) underwent transplantation within an average of 9 days. Actuarial survival at 12 months for all patients, operative survivors, patients age 55 years old or more, and patients bridged to transplantation was 87%, 92%, 84%, and 87%, respectively. Utilizing the combination therapy of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone introduced by one of us in 1983 and administered to all patients in this series, 50% of patients were rejection free and 56% were infection free at 12 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Following a two-week baseline period, subjects were treated for eight weeks with 3.4 g of psyllium or cellulose placebo at mealtimes (three doses per day). All subjects maintained their usual diets, which provided less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day and approximately 20% of energy from protein, 40% from carbohydrate, and 40% from fat. Eight weeks of treatment with psyllium reduced serum total cholesterol levels by 14.8%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 20.2%, and the ratio of LDL cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 14.8% relative to baseline values. The reductions in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol became progressively larger with time, and this trend appeared to be continuing at the eighth week. Psyllium treatment did not affect body weight, blood pressure, or serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, iron, or zinc. No significant changes in serum lipid levels, body weight, blood pressure, or other serum parameters were observed with placebo treatment. Subject adherence to psyllium treatment was excellent, and no adverse effects were observed. Results of this study show that psyllium is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia.\r"

This association has been appropriately termed as extraintestinal manifestations because large case studies have demonstrated that between 25% to 36% of patients with either type of inflammatory bowel disease will have at least one such associated disease. The spectrum of diseases reported associated with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease involves many organ systems. Some of these extraintestinal manifestations are related to active colitis--joint, skin, ocular, and oral; small bowel dysfunction--cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis; and nonspecific manifestations such as amyloidosis and hepatobiliary diseases. The purpose of this review is to update the clinicians with the most recent literature concerning the etiology, clinical course and the therapy of the extraintestinal manifestations associated with both forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Coronary artery disease (CAD) was the primary cause of death in individuals 36 to 45 years old. Non-CAD cardiac disease was the second most common cause of NPSD in this age group. Between the ages of 18 and 35 years, non-CAD cardiac disease was the primary cause and toxic ingestions were the second most common. Patients with rhythms other than ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia, asystole, or electromechanical dissociation on presentation to the emergency room (ER) were more likely to survive. Patients with asystole in the ER were more likely to die in the ER than were patients with other rhythms. Patients with toxic ingestions tended to have a better prognosis for successful resuscitation and for ultimate survival. Age, sex, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and time in the field were not significant prognostic variables. Patients with abdominal hemorrhage (eight of 83) as the cause of NPSD may represent a subgroup for whom a special approach is warranted. None of these patients survived. Early detection by culdocentesis or paracentesis in female patients of reproductive age and nasogastric lavage or stool occult blood testing could lead to more vigorous fluid resuscitation and early surgical intervention in abdominal hemorrhage.\r"

Seventy-four subjects with excessive alcohol intake, self-referred for outpatient detoxification, had no history or physical findings of liver disease. Surprisingly, in 49% (36/74) of alcoholics, two or more of these were elevated: serum bile acids, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and/or total bilirubin. All subjects were subdivided into 39 URNBA normal and 35 URNBA abnormal, using 2.6 mumol/g of creatinine as a dividing value. Serum tests confirmed the subgrouping made with URNBA. Compared with alanine aminotransferase, URNBA had better sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy predicting abnormal serum bile acids, AST, and alkaline phosphatase values. A predictive potential for a multivariate discriminant function of laboratory tests, known to best identify biopsy-documented mild liver disease, was only mildly inferior for URNBA when compared with AST. Multiple abnormalities of liver test results are unexpectedly frequent in asymptomatic alcoholics. The URNBA are helpful in the detection of liver abnormality in its clinically latent phase, because of the convenience of testing a spot sample of urine.\r"

Of these 61 patients, 80% were male, with a mean age of 59.5 years; 56% had acute pneumonia, and the remainder had an acute bronchitis. Causative pathogens included typical respiratory tract pathogens. Overall, 23 of 27 patients with bronchitis were clinically cured at the end of therapy. Thirty-one of 34 pneumonias were clinically cured or improved at the end of therapy; the three pneumonia treatment failures occurred in the lower dose cefuroxime (n = 2) and cefaclor (n = 1) treatment groups. Overall, bacteriologic cure occurred in 86% of patients treated with 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil compared with 60% of cefaclor-treated patients. Adverse clinical effects were uncommon. From this study, it was concluded that cefuroxime given every 12 hours is at least as clinically efficacious as cefaclor; it is a new oral cephalosporin with pharmacologic and bacterial spectrum advantages over many older agents.\r"

  ".W": "We found that nearly 10% of 142 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had persistent, unexplained hyperkalemia. Renal mineralocorticoid resistance has been suggested to account for the hyperkalemia in SLE. We studied the renin-aldosterone response to intravenous furosemide (60 mg) and upright posture and the renin response to converting enzyme inhibition (captopril, 50 mg) and upright posture in five patients with SLE and hyperkalemia (group 1) and five normokalemic patients with SLE (group 2). Renal function was comparable. Plasma chloride level was higher and bicarbonate level slightly lower in group 1 than in group 2. Plasma cortisol level was normal in all patients. None of the patients was receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids at the time of study. Basal plasma renin concentration and plasma aldosterone level were not significantly different between the two groups, although both tended to be higher in group 2. However, four of the five patients in group 1 had significantly blunted renin response to captopril compared with group 2. The same four patients also had blunted renin and aldosterone responses to furosemide. Thus, the majority of hyperkalemic patients with SLE had an impaired renin and aldosterone response to stimulation. We conclude that hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hyperkalemia in SLE.\r"

Patients were followed up for 6552 person-years of observation. No esophageal cancers developed (0.8 were expected). Members of the cohort developed one small-bowel malignant neoplasm (0.2 were expected), two gallbladder cancers (1.1 was expected), and four colon cancers (11.2 were expected), but these figures do not reflect a significant increase in the risk of these malignant neoplasms. In particular, the relative risk of developing colon cancer was only 0.4 when this analysis had 88% power to detect a relative risk of two or more. When the present investigation and two previous studies of this cohort were taken together, there was no strong evidence for an increased risk of any gastrointestinal cancer following gastric surgery.\r"

This distinctive presentation accounted for 13% of all hospitalized patients with VO and 2.4% of inpatients with osteoporotic compression fractures during the last five years; it may be more common than suggested by the paucity of published cases. In patients with osteoporosis and vertebral compression fractures, osteomyelitis should be considered when there is severe back pain, persistent unexplained fever, unexplained elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or bacteremia without an obvious extravertebral focus of infection, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised. Early biopsy and culture of the collapsed vertebral body will facilitate diagnosis and therapy.\r"

Following the development of this comparatively simple device, there has been a succession of increasingly, electrically exotic, electrocardiographs, none of which surpass the original Einthoven instrument in recording accuracy. The resolution of mechanical problems in the laboratory, incident to development of the Einthoven instrument, is of interest in view of the primitive laboratory equipment available during the period the device was developed. Einthoven's preference for funds for additional laboratory assistants and equipment, in lieu of a new laboratory building as a monument to his name and his subsequent disposal of half of the Nobel Prize money, reveal the basic character of this great man, rightfully called the Father of Electrocardiography.\r"

One hundred forty-one cases of Ludwig's angina reported since 1945 are reviewed and compared with 315 earlier cases. In the cases reported in the antibiotic era, the mean age of the patients was 29 years. Most patients were previously healthy but had evidence of dental disease. Submandibular swelling, elevation of the tongue, fever, dysphagia, and trismus were each present in more than one half of patients. Streptococci and anaerobes were most frequently isolated from soft-tissue cultures. Untreated, this illness is fatal in one half of patients. Early recognition is therefore essential.

Initial doses of 25 mg of dilevalol administered as a slowly given bolus reduced blood pressure by 14/16 mm Hg. With subsequent additional boluses to a total dose of up to 600 mg, supine diastolic blood pressure was reduced to less than 95 mm Hg in ten of 12 subjects studied (mean reduction, 28 mm Hg). Side effects were minimal and upright blood pressure at the time of reduction of blood pressure to goal was not significantly different from supine blood pressure. Plasma renin activity decreased in 11 of 11 subjects studied. Plasma epinephrine concentrations did not change significantly, whereas plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased 2 1/2-fold, probably reflecting the effect of beta 2-agonism on norepinephrine release. Dilevalol appears to be a safe and effective way of lowering blood pressure short term when intravenous antihypertensive therapy is indicated.\r"

Liver and muscles represent the major buffering system, partially mediated by insulin, in the distribution of potassium between intracellular and extracellular fluids. To study the potential role of the liver, we administered an oral load of potassium (0.75 mEq/kg) to nine male patients with compensated cirrhosis and ten normal subjects of similar age, sex, and weight. Despite identical renal excretion, cirrhotic patients had higher potassium levels two and three hours after oral administration. Moreover, only cirrhotic patients presented a clear-cut increase in serum C-peptide concentration after the potassium load without any change in glucose level. It is likely that, in cirrhosis, liver failure contributes to the decrease in hepatic cellular potassium uptake despite insulin hypersecretion.\r"

Review of the world literature enabled us to identify a statistically significant increased prevalence of plasma cell dyscrasia among patients with protracted scleredema. In all patients, plasma cell dyscrasia appeared years after the onset of scleredema. Immunofluorescent studies were negative for immunoglobulin deposition. We assume, therefore, that the plasma cell dyscrasia was secondary to scleredema.\r"

The seven-year cumulative survival improved from 12% before 1976 to 20% after 1976. Sixty-eight of the patients survived for more than four years, and 25 are still alive. Of deaths, 51% were due to cardiovascular disease, 24% to the discontinuation of dialysis, 14% to infections, and 11% to other causes. Over the course of the study, older and sicker patients were increasingly accepted for dialysis, and younger and healthier patients were increasingly accepted for transplantation. The 25 patients who are still alive and undergoing dialysis were hospitalized 1.4 times per patient year for 19 hospital days per patient year the first year and for eight days per patient year after that. Two became blind, three had amputations, seven worked full-time. The results of long-term dialysis in patients with diabetes have improved greatly over the last two decades.\r"

The experience with group B streptococcal disease was analyzed at one medical center over a ten-year period from 1975 to 1984. Streptococcus agalactiae bacteremia was observed in 29 adults and 26 infants, with an attack rate of 0.2 cases per 1000 adult admissions and 3.2 cases per 1000 live births, respectively. The majority of adult infections apparently occurred as a result of nosocomial acquisition and was associated with a high mortality rate of 38%. Risk factors for group B streptococcal sepsis in adults include diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and hepatic failure. The majority (73%) of neonatal cases occurred within seven days of birth and occurred in a setting of maternal fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, or prematurity. The mortality rate in infants was remarkably low at only 15%. Fatalities occurred in both adults and infants, despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Infection control strategies against group B streptococcus must address potential nosocomial dissemination in adults as well as vertical transmission in infants.\r"

The conditions of two of these patients were refractory to corticosteroids, but giving IV immune globulin along with steroids appeared to enhance the response to IV immune globulin. A review of the literature revealed that 53 (88%) of 60 patients with HIV-associated thrombocytopenia responded to IV immune globulin with platelet counts greater than 50 x 10(9)/L (50 x 10(3)/mm3). We conclude that IV immune globulin therapy achieves transient elevations in platelet counts to levels that control bleeding and permit surgery in patients with severe, HIV-associated thrombocytopenia.\r"

In comparison with GBS associated with respiratory infections, the delay between the first symptoms of infection and the development of GBS is somewhat longer, an observation in accordance with GBS associated with gastrointestinal symptoms of unidentified etiology. The clinical picture and the outcome do not seem to differ from those of GBS associated with other disorders. Campylobacter jejuni appears to be a pathogen capable of triggering GBS and will probably become increasingly recognized if appropriate culture and serologic tests are performed.\r"

We used a two-week, single-blind placebo washout followed by a six-week, double-blind comparison of imipramine hydrochloride and placebo in a sample of 76 outpatients with DSM-III dysthymic disorder entered into a trial at two centers. Subjects were preponderantly female, had insidious onset at an early age, and had depressions of moderate severity; 96% also met the DSM-III criteria for major depressive disorder at the time of presentation. Sixty percent had a history of persistent depressive symptoms sufficient to meet criteria for major depression for longer than two years. Markedly favorable responses occurred in 45% of imipramine-treated (n = 29) and 12% of placebo-treated (n = 25) patients and, respectively, 59% and 13% of those who completed the study. Imipramine produced significant advantage in measures of depressive symptoms, global severity of illness, and self-rated social and vocational function. Recovered patients experienced remission from both long-standing symptoms and deficits as well as more recently exacerbated aspects of their syndrome. Patients with pure dysthymic disorder of a mild, subsyndromal type were uncommon in these clinical settings. However, anti-depressant medication was effective for many moderately severe chronic depressions, which had previously been untreated or undertreated, presumably related to misdiagnosis.\r"

We hypothesized that if wide-open drainage of the abdominal cavity is provided, thus not allowing intra-abdominal collections to form, mortality in these patients can be reduced. Since 1982 we have treated 49 patients with necrotic pancreatitis and related infections and 15 patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis from intestinal perforations. The surgical treatment was based on the provision for daily laparotomies in the intensive care unit with the patient under epidural anesthesia by using an \"open-abdomen\" technique (zipper alone or a zipper-mesh combination). The APACHE II score and the functional classification were used to derive expected mortalities. The patients with intraabdominal sepsis had a mean APACHE II score of 25 and an expected mortality of 45%, vs the 26.5% mortality that we observed. The lowest mortality in the necrotic pancreatitis group was associated with noninfected pancreatic necrosis (6%) and single abscess (9%) vs 22% mortality rate in the patients with infected pancreatic necrosis. The mean expected mortality in this group was 47%, vs the observed 22%. We attributed this result to the daily abdominal explorations that achieved a complete excision of infected or necrotic tissue.\r"

Blood and organ bacterial cultures were similar between these two groups.

Similarly, the plasma anaphylatoxin level was increased before therapy and returned to the normal range within seven days. Escherichia coli incubated in vitro in fresh human serum at body temperature started formation of TCC in a dose-related manner. As complement will induce cellular lysis via TCC and edema via anaphylatoxins, anemia and impaired respiration in these patients may be influenced by increased concentrations of terminal complement complexes and of C3a and C5a.\r"

To determine whether RBC deformability was affected in human or murine sepsis, a deformability index was determined in a human study and a murine model. Deformability was decreased postoperatively in patients with sepsis (0.49 +/- 0.12) compared with patients without sepsis (1.62 +/- 0.13) and normal control volunteers (1.51 +/- 0.17). Deformability was decreased in rats that had undergone cecal ligation and puncture (0.37 +/- 0.06) compared with that of sham-operated rats (0.76 +/- 0.12), as well as in endotoxemic rats (0.38 +/- 0.4) compared with control rats (0.82 +/- 0.11). These data suggest that RBC deformability decreases in both human and murine sepsis. This effect could be an important factor in the disordered oxygen utilization noted in human sepsis, and its correction could lead to better tissue oxygenation and preserved organ function.\r"

To address the lingering skepticism that mitochondrial assays in surviving animals might not detect this \"injury,\" we injected rats with a lethal dose of Escherichia coli endotoxin and compared hepatic, cardiac, and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in these animals with that of control rats. Mitochondrial function was serially determined during a four-hour postmortem period by measuring the respiratory control ratio, the adenosine diphosphate-oxygen ratio, and protein levels. Hepatic mitochondria ceased to function within 30 minutes of the time of death. Cardiac and skeletal muscle mitochondria functioned normally up to four hours after death in both septic and control animals. Mitochondria from septic animals had a significantly higher respiratory control ratio than those from control rats. Thus, sepsis appears to enhance rather than damage mitochondrial function up to four hours after death.\r"

Group M (n = 9) continued to receive baseline fluids (2 mL/kg/h), while group R (n = 6) received 7 mL/kg/h of Ringer's lactate. After an initial drop in cardiac index, animals in both groups developed a hyperdynamic state. The fall in mean arterial pressure seen in group M was absent from group R. The higher fluid volume resulted in a rise in left atrial pressure and pulmonary microvascular pressure. The lung lymph flow and permeability index were elevated in both groups but were higher in group R. The calculated filtration coefficient showed a threefold increase in both groups. Augmented fluid resuscitation during endotoxemia resulted in an elevated interstitial fluid flux and permeability index secondary to an increase in pulmonary microvascular pressure and greater surface area of the injured microvascular beds being perfused.\r"

On the basis of experimental data and clinical evidence related to the pathophysiological sequelae of segmental bile duct obstruction, and given the potentially harmful complications of reconstructive surgery in combination with its uncertain outcome, it is suggested that simple ligation of injured segmental ducts is the treatment of choice, irrespective of their size.\r"

Our technique was used on 100 high-risk patients and compared with double control groups, one consisting of 200 normal-risk patients and the second of 100 high-risk patients. We found that the incidence of wound infections was reduced to 1% with our new technique compared with 3% and 1% in the control groups (the high- and normal-risk groups, respectively). There was neither dehiscence nor mediastinitis in the study group, compared with 1% and 0.5% incidences of these complications in the controls. Also, there was no mortality in the combined-closure group compared with mortality of 0.5% and 1% in the control groups. We believe that this closure effectively strengthens the complex of bone and wire, improving the stability of the chest by giving a correct axis to the sternum. It is also cost-effective and easy to perform and does not prolong operation time.\r"

MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that readily enters the central nervous system, was evaluated in two focal central nervous system ischemia models: a multiple cerebral embolic model and a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model. When animals were treated five minutes after the onset of injury, MK-801 was effective in reducing ischemic damage in both models. In the multiple cerebral embolic model, the average dose of microspheres trapped in the brain increased from 344.8 +/- 51.4 micrograms (n = 29) in controls to 534 +/- 41.4 micrograms (n = 17) in the MK-801-treated group. Similarly, in the rabbit spinal cord ischemia model, the average ischemia duration increased from 28.9 +/- 1.7 minutes (n = 52) in controls to 50.6 +/- 3.9 minutes (n = 12) in the MK-801-treated group. These results suggest that this glutamate antagonist should be useful for the treatment of stroke.\r"

To my knowledge, this is the first article in the medical historical literature to mention this famous and influential Indian. Historical accounts state that Opechankanough was so weak as to be unable to walk, making it necessary that he be carried about on a litter. Moreover, his eyelids were so weak they had to be raised by his attendants. Additionally, a hint of improvement in this weakness after rest is suggested by one historical account. The differential diagnosis of Chief Opechankanough's weakness is discussed. The historical setting of this famous chief in Colonial America and Colonial Virginia is described, as well.\r"

Clinical studies have identified several rare but definable causes for apparent ALS. Certain clinical features previously considered unlikely to occur in ALS are found on careful examination. Epidemiologic surveillance and recent studies of neurotoxic plant seeds used in Guam have shed light on the pathogenesis of endemic ALS. Extensive analyses of biochemical, metabolic, immunologic, viral, and toxic factors have provided provocative results requiring further studies. Reflecting on some of these hypotheses, therapeutic trials have been performed more vigorously than ever. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is now investigated at the molecular genetic level. Human autopsy and experimental animal studies have expanded our understanding of basic mechanisms involving motoneuronal degeneration. In the future, we must continue a relentless search for the pathogenesis of ALS, prospective clinical studies to define the limits of ALS, and well-designed, controlled therapeutic trials.\r"

According to computed tomographic, angiographic, and/or autopsy findings, the patients were classified as having MCA occlusive lesions in the central (sphenoidal) part or in peripheral branches or MCA stenosis. With MCA lesions, the MCA flow velocity (FV) was reduced. At the same time the anterior cerebral artery FV increased because of collateral flow over leptomeningeal anastomoses. Central MCA lesions showed less marked changes than did peripheral lesions. In MCA stenosis a steep rise of MCA FV appeared inside the stenotic segment. If there was a high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery, a collateral circulation over the anterior part of the circle of Willis was seen in addition to the changes caused by the MCA disease. From these hemodynamic changes, transcranial Doppler sonographic diagnostic criteria for MCA occlusive and stenotic lesions were established.\r"

Twenty-four patients were admitted within three days of SAH. Twenty-three of these patients had an excellent result, and one patient died. There were no cases of delayed cerebral infarction. In 18 of 23 patients admitted more than three days after SAH, there was an excellent result. The other five patients had permanent morbidity related to the original SAH. These preliminary data suggest that immediate aneurysm surgery and aggressive postoperative prophylactic volume expansion in all patients can substantially reduce rebleeding and delayed cerebral ischemia, potential causes of morbidity, after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A more extensive prospective trial of this approach will be required to test this hypothesis.\r"

Brain diseases in DCM were classified in terms of symptom complexes. Some of the 33 chapters discuss tremor, tetanus, vertigo, epilepsy, and hemicrania. Concepts of diseases, and their pathogenesis and treatment, reflected the writings of Greek, Roman, and Arabic authors, as well as newer concepts of astrology and pharmacy that were prevalent during the Renaissance. There were few new bedside or clinical observations in DCM. However, DCM is an important text, crystallizing several 16th century trends to provide the first compendium of brain disorders.\r"

The sensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium, which are cell layers in zinc, appear to be prominently involved in the disease process. Because zinc plays a role in the metabolic function of several important enzymes in the chorioretinal complex, we undertook a prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled investigation of the effects of oral zinc administration on the visual acuity outcome in 151 subjects with drusen or macular degeneration. Although some eyes in the zinc-treated group lost vision, this group had significantly less visual loss than the placebo group after a follow-up of 12 to 24 months. This is the first controlled oral intervention study to show a positive, if limited, treatment effect in macular degeneration, a major public health problem. Because of the pilot nature of the study and the possible toxic effects and complications of oral zinc administration, widespread use of zinc in macular degeneration is not now warranted.\r"

Using the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer, a sensation was recorded in the center of the graft no earlier than 18 months. We found a progressive return of sensitivity from the periphery toward the center of the graft. Regression analysis indicated a rate of return of sensitivity that averaged 0.029 mm/mo for each diagnostic category except herpes simplex keratitis. The slope of the return of sensitivity in the group with herpes simplex keratitis was essentially flat, showing no central progression. None of the eight patients with herpes simplex keratitis had a sensation recorded further than 0.5 mm from the wound margin.\r"

Stromal scarring extended to involve the anterior two thirds of the corneal stroma. The collagen in this area was contracted and folded. The keratocytes and stromal collagen of the posterior third of the cornea were normal by light microscopy. Descemet's membrane and the endothelium also were normal. Despite the short-lived flattening of corneal topography, this procedure dramatically altered the stromal collagen in the anterior two thirds of the cornea.\r"

Suction is applied to the donor cornea through the four cuts, resulting in four radial marks in the donor corneal epithelium. Four radial marks are also made in the host cornea before trephination, using a radial keratotomy marker. When the donor button is placed within the recipient opening, the radial marks are aligned and used as guides for the cardinal sutures. This simple technique allows for matching of the donor and host circumferences, even if there is some collapse of the peripheral host cornea and sclera at surgery, and should minimize astigmatism resulting from donor/host misalignment.\r"

In 24 technically successful studies, multiple cross sectional echocardiographic images, obtained before and after intracoronary (sonicated contrast) injection, were stored by high speed, real time data transfer to an on line minicomputer. Subsequent digital subtraction processing of the stored image data provided composite images in which the distribution of myocardial perfusion was easily seen. Quantitative analysis of peak enhanced myocardial grey level and washout half time successfully differentiated between myocardial segments in which angiography had suggested normal, reduced, and grossly impaired or absent perfusion. The results suggest that this new method of digital image capture and quantitative processing has substantial advantages over previous off line qualitative techniques. It is likely to be of considerable value for routine coronary arteriography, angioplasty, and coronary thrombolysis.\r"

Intense epidermal staining was seen adjacent to squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, but not adjacent to melanocytic naevi. In specimens of melanocytic naevi, LI staining around pilosebaceous units was weak or absent. Around the three malignant types of lesion, epidermal LI positivity faded distally--thereby indicating the extent of the tumour. LI was, in addition, expressed by the most highly differentiated cells in squamous cell carcinomas, whereas the other neoplasms were negative. Antibody to LI may, thus, be a useful adjunct for distinction between various types of skin tumours.\r"

Lesions of the eyes, nose, pharynx, vulva and urethra also occurred in both groups. The lesions tended to be more widespread in CP patients. Twenty-one patients with BP and 14 with CP were examined by an ophthalmologist. Fine scarring of the tarsal conjunctiva was found in both groups, but also in elderly controls. However, symblepharon occurred in one patient with BP as well as in three patients with CP, but was not seen in a group of 20 controls. Direct immunofluorescence (IF) studies showed linear deposition of IgG or C3 or both in the basement membrane zone of the skin, oral mucosa and conjunctival mucosa in both groups. The frequency of positive immunofluorescence was higher in the conjunctiva than in the lip mucosa or skin in both BP and CP patients.

Oxytocic drugs used routinely appear to reduce the risk of postpartum haemorrhage by about 40% (typical odds ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.44-0.73) implying that for every 22 women given such an oxytocic, one postpartum haemorrhage could be prevented.

At 16-18 weeks gestation there is a significant positive correlation (r = 0.40) between P-ALP and maternal plasma alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) values in low birthweight cases.

However, measurement of radiological damage is fraught with methodological problems and studies to define what is the best approach have only recently been performed. There is also the problem of differentiating between radiological progression which is unavoidable due to mechanical derangement and that which is due to currently active disease. The effect of treatment on radiological damage remains controversial. A better understanding of how to use this important outcome measure should now provide rheumatologists with a more critical assessment of new therapies as well as providing a better knowledge of the disease process.\r"

Short-term studies of disease modifying drugs show significant clinical and laboratory improvements in comparison to placebo. Longer-term studies suggest that this improvement is not maintained. Attempts to assess the effect of disease modifying and immunosuppressive drugs on radiological progression suggest that they may have a week protective effect, but there is no evidence to suggest that this is maintained in the long term. Studies of corticosteroid therapy indicate that in large doses it possesses disease modifying properties and is capable of retarding radiological progression. The benefit-risk ratio of such doses is unacceptable. Lower doses have not yet been adequately investigated. Rheumatologists should regard existing suppressive agents as moderately effective in the short term. Few patients remain on single drug therapy for prolonged periods and available evidence does not suggest that these drugs are capable of altering the long-term outcome of rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

In 75% of patients the inflammatory disease has subsided by adulthood, leaving some with degenerative and mechanical problems. Systemic, polyarticular and pauciarticular subgroups, based on mode of presentation, have been related to prognosis. Seropositive polyarticular disease behaves as an aggressive form of adult rheumatoid arthritis. Standard methods of assessment are inappropriate in children. Active joint score is most useful. Radiographs are difficult to interpret because of growth and lack of early erosive disease. Growth and social outcome is important. Death occurs in 7% of cases and is due to infection and cardiac involvement during active systemic disease, and due to secondary amyloidosis later. Slow-acting drugs and surgical procedures may alter outcome. The aetiology of these diseases remains unknown and there is a need for diagnostic tests, particularly to identify those children who will do badly.\r"

  ".W": "The value of urologist-operated real time ultrasound scanning was assessed in the urological out-patient clinic. In terms of accuracy, the urologists' ultrasound scans of the genito-urinary tract proved comparable with those of the radiologists. The techniques were quickly learned and scanning added little to the consultation time. Scanning during clinic time was shown to be both time-saving and cost-effective by allowing more rapid assessment of the patient and a speedier diagnosis. In economic terms considerable savings could be made by reducing the need for formal ultrasound referrals, since patients scanned at the out-patient clinic would be spared two further trips to hospital, one for the formal examination and another for the out-patient clinic review. Clinic turnover thus becomes more efficient and inconvenience to the patient and transport costs are lessened.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the possible implications of heterogeneity among the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas for bone marrow purging using complement-fixing monoclonal antibodies to lymphoma-associated antigens, a panel of large cell lymphoma cell lines of diverse phenotypes was treated with monoclonal antibodies DLC-48 and LN-1. An association was demonstrated between the percentage of suppression of colony formation by the cell line and both the percentage of cells staining with the antibody and the intensity of its binding. Flow cytometric analysis of cells surviving treatment with antibody and complement demonstrated that the population that escaped lysis showed weak immunofluorescent staining. Similarly, 40% of the clones derived from cells surviving treatment with antibody and complement stained weakly compared with the parent cell line. For a given fluorescence intensity, cells differed in their susceptibility to treatment. Some cells with moderate to strong staining survived incubation with antibody and complement. In five cases, treatment of bone marrow contaminated with malignant lymphoma cells resulted in complete eradication of even cells with weak staining. In two cases, a population of cells that stained dimly survived treatment with either antibody. DNA-content analysis showed that the cell cycle distribution of cells surviving treatment with DLC-48 or LN-1 and complement was similar to that of cells treated with control antibody 46-1G7 and complement. Phenotypic heterogeneity may hinder efforts to purge malignant lymphoma cells from human bone marrow with complement-fixing monoclonal antibody reagents. Relative resistance to complement-mediated lysis may underlie differences in the susceptibility of cells to treatment and also limit the effectiveness of this technique.\r"

In its pattern of reactivity, the last antibody overlaps the low and high molecular weight keratin antibodies and is used as a broad spectrum keratin antibody. By World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the cases in this article included eight keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas, eight nonkeratinizing carcinomas, 20 undifferentiated carcinomas, and four adenocarcinomas. The antibody to broad spectrum keratin had an overall sensitivity of 87.5% and was positive in all eight keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas, seven nonkeratinizing carcinomas (87.5%), 18 undifferentiated carcinomas (90%), and two adenocarcinomas (50%). Low molecular weight keratin antibody stained one additional NPC, which was negative when broad spectrum keratin antibody was used. Involucrin and high molecular weight keratin antibodies demonstrated near parallel staining in all histologic classes; there was marked localization to areas of squamous differentiation. While involucrin is a marker for foci of greater squamous differentiation, broad spectrum keratin antibody may aid in the diagnosis of all histologic subtypes of NPC.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that myocardial systolic contraction attenuates diastolic coronary flow was tested by comparing flow during diastole to flow during a prolonged asystole. The circumflex coronary artery was cannulated and perfused at constant pressure in closed-chest, morphine- and alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs. The heart was paced at 80, 120, 160, or 200 beats/min after atrioventricular heart block under control, intracoronary adenosine, and intravenous norepinephrine treatment conditions. Cessation of pacing while holding coronary pressure constant at the previous diastolic pressure resulted in asystolic circumflex flow that initially equaled the previous diastolic flow during heart rates of 80, 120, and 160 in all treatment groups. Initial asystolic circumflex flow was approximately 5% higher than the previous diastolic flow at a heart rate of 200 beats/min, but this was probably due to an artifact. It is concluded that systolic contraction does not limit diastolic coronary flow at heart rates less than 160 beats/min and probably does not at higher heart rates.\r"

The overall prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than 90 mm Hg, was 0.67% among white men screened for MRFIT and increased with age (0.31% among 35- to 39-year-olds to 1.7% among 55- to 57-year-olds). The 6 year CHD and all-cause mortality rates in men over 50 were highest in those with ISH compared with both subjects with diastolic hypertension and those with normal pressure. The relative risk of death from stroke in those with ISH, compared with that in those with SBP less than 160 mm Hg and those with DBP less than 90 mm Hg, was 3.0 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 6.8). In addition, at any level of DBP, the level of SBP appeared to be the major determinant of all-cause and CHD mortality. The determinants of ISH in individuals under 60 years of age as well as the possible efficacy of its treatment should be evaluated further.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate possible immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of myocarditis, we examined, by immunofluorescence techniques, the serial changes in lymphocyte subsets in the heart, spleen, and peripheral blood of C3H/He mice inoculated coxsackievirus B3 (experiment I). B cells were identified by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit antimouse immunoglobulin. T cell subsets were demonstrated with rat anti-Thy 1.2, anti-Lyt 1, anti-Lyt 2, and anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibodies, respectively, plus fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antimouse immunoglobin. The percent of Thy 1.2+, Lyt 1+, and L3T4+ cells was decreased in the peripheral blood on days 3, 7, and 14. B cells were increased on day 3. In contrast, Thy 1.2+ (pan T) or Lyt 1+ cells appeared to occupy the major portion of the myocardium on days 7 and 14, when myocarditis was most severe, while B cells were sparse. For confirmation, serial immunohistologic studies (immunoperoxidase staining) of the hearts of C3H/He mice with coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis were performed (experiment II). Most of the stained cells in the heart were Thy 1.2, Lyt 1, and Lyt 2 positive on days 7 and 14. Thus, independent methods demonstrate that specific antigenic markers on lymphocytes at the site of inflammation in the acute stage of viral myocarditis differ from those on corresponding peripheral lymphocytes, and suggest the possible involvement of Thy 1.2+ (pan T) cells, mainly the Lyt 1+ and Lyt 2+ subsets (immature T cells), in the development of myocarditis in this preparation.\r"

Seventy-five samples were studied, 15 normal, 15 fatty, 15 fibrofatty, 15 fibrous, and 15 calcific. A broadband transducer (4 to 14 MHz) was used. The aqueous phase-intima reflection (expressed in dB, mean +/- SD) was lowest in the fatty plaques (-35.3 +/- 2.5), differing in a highly significant way from that in all other groups: normal (-13.2 +/- 8.8), fibrofatty (-20.4 +/- 8.3), fibrous (-13.0 +/- 9.7), calcific (-5.9 +/- 3.4). The echo coming from the intima-media transition was of relatively low amplitude in normal and in fatty samples; typically, strong reflections from the intima-media transitions were present in the other pathologic subsets. In conclusion, the time domain echo pattern of the arterial wall may provide a useful clue to the structure of the plaque.\r"

  ".W": "After 18 h of mechanical ventilation following open heart surgery, central hemodynamics, systemic oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption were assessed in ten consecutive patients receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine levels were analyzed. While maintaining the mean airway pressure, two CPAP methods were studied: a demand CPAP with continuous flow without (CPAP) and one with high-frequency ventilation (CPAP-HFV). The frequency used during CPAP-HFV was 300 cycle/min. The spontaneous ventilatory rate was found to be equal during CPAP and CPAP-HFV. The cardiac and stroke volume indices were slightly higher (p less than .05) during CPAP-HFV, which accounted for the finding that DO2 was also slightly higher (p less than .05) during CPAP-HFV. The epinephrine and norepinephrine levels did not differ, whereas the vasopressin level was somewhat higher during CPAP-HFV, which might indicate a higher level of vigilance. It is concluded that cardiac output was slightly higher during CPAP-HFV compared to that during CPAP. This may be due to an effect of the oscillations on circulation or to differences in the level of vigilance.\r"

The work of breathing was calculated as the difference in VO2 between spontaneous and mechanical ventilation and expressed as a percentage of VO2vent (% delta VO2). The average % delta VO2 for eight normal healthy volunteers was 3.7 +/- 1.8%, while it was 7.7 +/- 8.8% with the Bechman and Utah metabolic carts for patients recovering from ventilatory failure who were weaned successfully from respiratory support based on clinical criteria within 24 h of their metabolic study. In patients who were not weaned successfully, the average % delta VO2 measured was 24.7 +/- 12.3%. Indirect calorimetry is a relatively simple, reliable bedside technique for determining the oxygen cost of breathing. In our sample, the oxygen cost of breathing was a reliable predictor of weaning and extubation in patients recovering from respiratory failure. This measurement may be clinically useful in identifying the patient who cannot sustain spontaneous ventilation because of excessive respiratory work.\r"

When continuous mechanical ventilation (CMV) with 10 cm H2O of PEEP was applied to dogs previously on CMV with zero PEEP, RVP increased from 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg (p less than .01), and left RBF decreased from 66 to 57 ml/min (p less than .05). RBF recovered by 49% of the difference as soon as PEEP was discontinued when the RVP elevation was maintained at the level observed during 10 cm H2O of PEEP. With 20 cm H2O of PEEP, RVP increased further to 10 mm Hg (p less than .01) and left RBF decreased to 48 ml/min (p less than .05). When the left renal vein was occluded and the RVP was maintained at the level seen during 20 cm H2O of PEEP, left RBF recovered only 50% of the difference from the flow during zero PEEP. We conclude that the reduction in RBF with PEEP application is caused by several factors; however, RVP elevation during CMV with PEEP is influential in decreasing RBF.\r"

We employed a single-position graphic (SPG) calibration technique for gain factor calculation in 38 studies on five sedated lambs who were receiving intermittent mandatory mechanical ventilation (IMV). The SPG technique uses selection of two breaths from a 20-sec run of breaths with different ribcage/pneumotachograph (PNT) and abdomen/PNT ratios for gain calculation. Validation of gains was performed by comparing volumes obtained simultaneously by RIP and PNT. The mean tidal volume (VT) measured by RIP corresponded well with mean VT measured by PNT with animals receiving 42.2 +/- 13.2 (SD) % of breaths over 1 min by IMV. Time for calibration and validation ranged between 15 and 30 min. The results of this study suggest that the SPG calibration technique provides an accurate method of calibration of RIP in sedated lambs receiving IMV.\r"

When cardiovascular function is compromised, circulatory compensations are aimed at maintaining supply-dependent tissues. In the long term, this leads to the possibility of an inadequate blood flow to supply independent tissues. The perfusion maintenance of all organs requires adequate cardiac output, blood volume, and arterial BP. When BP and cardiac output fail, regional perfusion diminishes. Although the human system tolerates anemia well, optimum Hct levels are probably between 30% to 40%. Inadequate perfusion can be supplemented partially by increasing the FIO2 on a temporary basis. Hyperoxic arterial oxygen tensions may cause maldistribution of blood flow within organs.\r"

These changes have generally not been of sufficient magnitude to carry clinical significance. The lung dysfunction observed has been attributed to an associated hyperlipemia. Recent studies, however, suggest that the associated impairment in lung function is due to alterations in pulmonary vascular tone (which results in ventilation/perfusion inequalities) caused by an IVFE-related increase in prostaglandin (PG) production. The polyunsaturated fatty acids in the IVFE serve as precursors to the PGs. Due to the varied effects of PGs on inflammation and pulmonary vasomotor tone, infusion of IVFE could have profound physiologic and pharmacologic actions aside from the provision of lipid calories. In some circumstances, IVFE may, in fact, be beneficial to the lung via alterations in\r"

A total of 1649 catheter tips were cultured and 58 (3.5%) yielded positive cultures. Specifically, the incidence of positive catheter tip cultures for iv, central venous, arterial and pulmonary arterial (PA) catheters was 0.9%, 5.9%, 3.9% and 10.6%, respectively, whereas one of the six surgically placed venous and arterial catheters had a positive tip culture and none of the 279 transthoracic catheters. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from 79% of the positive tip cultures. Ten percent of the children had one or more positive tip cultures but none developed catheter-related septicemia or endocarditis. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that longer in situ time (p less than .001), younger age (p less than .001), and inotropic support (p = .003) were significant independent predictors of risk for children developing positive catheter tip cultures. The safe in situ period for arterial, central venous, and PA catheters is 3 days in infants under 1 yr and 4 and 6 days for arterial and central venous catheters, respectively, in older children, if 0.95 cumulative probability of remaining free of a positive tip culture is accepted. The data generally support the bacteriologic safety of invasive hemodynamic monitoring in infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery.\r"

The percentage of samples with a pH less than 4 fell in all groups during therapy; while there was no significant difference between groups, pH control was achieved more rapidly in the bolus group. Infusion therapy with ranitidine is an attractive concept but a loading dose must be used. The presence of occult blood in the gastric juice did not correlate with pH and was not affected by ranitidine therapy.\r"

The remaining infections were divided equally among GI, skin, eye, upper respiratory, postoperative wounds, and other sites. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent pathogens. Surgical patients had similar rates of infection to medical patients. Patients in the first 2 yr of life, particularly those between 7 and 30 days of age, had the highest rate of infection. Onset of infection was more common after the first week in the PICU with 11% of patients staying 14 to 20 days, 27% of patients staying 21 to 27 days, 48% of patients staying 28 to 34 days, and 52% of patients staying more than 35 days before the onset of infection.

Glucagon antagonized verapamil-induced hypotension and bradycardia in rats; however, glucagon's ability to antagonize other CCBs is unexplored. This study determined: a) if glucagon reverses verapamil-induced depression by a direct cardiac effect, b) if myocardial depression induced by diltiazem and nifedipine (representing different classes of CCBs) is also reversed by glucagon, and c) the glucagon concentration needed to reverse myocardial depression. Isolated rat hearts were perfused at a constant flow rate in a Langendorff preparation. Developed pressure (dP), contractility (+dP/dtmax), relaxation (-dP/dtmax), heart rate, and coronary vascular resistance were recorded. A CCB (n = 6, each blocker) was infused until greater than 50% depression of contractility was achieved. Glucagon was then simultaneously infused (perfusion concentration of 0.6-1.1 x 10(-7) M), and repeat cardiac variables were recorded. In a separate group of 36 hearts, glucagon dose response was determined. After producing a greater than 50% depression in dP/dtmax with 3 mumol of diltiazem, a single concentration of glucagon was infused simultaneously into each heart (perfusion concentrations between 10(-6) and 10(-9) M) and percent recovery of baseline function was determined. Glucagon restored baseline contractility and dP with all three CCBs. Complete reversal of diltiazem-induced myocardial depression occurs at glucagon concentrations greater than or equal to 5 x 10(-7) M. We conclude that a) glucagon directly reverses myocardial depression from three classes of CCBs at concentrations achieved in vivo, and b) glucagon may be useful in the treatment of CCB-induced myocardial toxicity.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the computerized PEEP titration system with a standard clinical PEEP titration algorithm in the animal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model. Thirty mongrel dogs were anesthetized, paralyzed, intubated, and ventilated. An acute pulmonary injury was produced using 0.09 ml/kg of oleic acid. The animals were then given PEEP for 5 h. Arterial and venous blood gases, BP, thermodilution cardiac output, heart rate, body temperature, total respiratory system compliance (Ctr), and end-tidal CO2 were measured every 30 min. FRC was measured using an automated sulfur hexafluoride washout system every 15 min. The animals were allocated randomly to three ten-animal groups. The first group had PEEP titrated using a standard clinical protocol; the remaining two groups had PEEP updated at 15-min intervals under computer control to maintain FRC at 1.4 times the postanesthetized, postparalyzed, preinjury value. The second group received fixed 3-cm H2O PEEP steps. The third group had variable size PEEP steps depending on the output of a proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controller. PaCO2 was maintained at 35.8 +/- 3.4 (SD) torr. There was a significant difference in PEEP delivered between the three groups (p = .0006) and in FRC (p = .005).

The development of edema was studied in various brain regions (cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, cerebellum) using a linear specific gravity gradient column. Regional brain tissue density was measured within 1 min, at 15 and 60 min, 18 h, 4 and 10 days after injury to the left cerebral hemisphere, and was compared with values in sham-operated and control rats. Significant edema (i.e., reduced specific gravity) occurred only in the traumatized hemisphere and was maximal at 18 h. A neurologic severity score (NSS) was developed to evaluate the status of the rat after injury. Specific gravity was significantly correlated with NSS at 18 h after injury. The affected hemisphere displayed hemorrhagic lesions as early as one hour post head trauma (HT), which evolved into hemorrhagic necrosis at 18 h. A pathologic score, evaluated 18 h post HT based on size and severity of the lesion, was correlated with the NSS and evaluated for each rat at one hour and 18 h postimpact. This correlation was found to be highly significant. This model of brain injury may be useful in future studies on the effects of therapeutic agents.\r"

Twelve pigs receiving endotoxin + Ringer's acetate displayed a progressive 45% decline in cardiac output (Qt) and a two-peaked increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with a late increase of 250%.

Blood and infusion fluid specimens were also cultured if septicemia was clinically suspected. Mean duration of catheterization was 59 +/- 6 (SE) h. In our series, all catheter and infusion fluid cultures were negative. Local inflammation was not predictive of catheter tip infection and correlated poorly with duration of catheterization (r = 0.2). In our experience, the incidence of infection related to arterial catheterization is low. Routine change of infusion fluid, tubing, dressing and insertion site as well as systematic catheter culture in the absence of fever appears unwarranted.\r"

Most of the reported cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis were not diagnosed either antemortem or before surgical intervention. A simple diagnostic method, Riu's stain, can be used routinely in bronchoscopic brushing smears, or for needle aspiration cytologic studies, making pulmonary cryptococcosis easy to diagnose.\r"

All patients were operated upon by a single surgeon from 1966 to 1971. Eighty-three patients underwent insertion of 85 homograft aortic valves. Homografts were sterilized with either betapropiolactone (39 valves) or gamma irradiation (41 valves) and were inserted following storage in nutrient medium (16 valves) or after cryopreservation (51 valves). All homograft valves were sutured in the subcoronary position using a freehand technique. There was a 55 percent 15-year actuarial patient survival and a 16 percent 15-year actuarial homograft survival in this cohort. Homograft valve failure occurred gradually allowing the patients to be observed until they developed hemodynamic compromise at which time elective valve replacement was performed.\r"

  ".W": "Changes induced by nifedipine (10 mg sublingually) in the residual luminal diameter of significant (greater than 50 percent) coronary lesions were assessed angiographically in 69 patients with effort-induced angina (group 1), in 22 patients with mixed angina (group 2), and in 14 patients with Prinzmetal's angina (group 3). These changes were related to the clinical response to treatment with the same drug, as evaluated through diary records and Holter monitoring in the mixed (spontaneous component) and Prinzmetal forms and through exercise testing in effort-induced and mixed (effort-associated component) angina. In groups 1 and 2, segments of stenotic vessels showed either an increase or decrease or no change in diameter with the calcium antagonist; in group 3, the majority of the lesions had compliant portions which invariably responded with dilatation. Nifedipine failed to improve cases with exertional (20 percent [14/69] unchanged; 19 percent [13/69] worsened) and mixed (41 percent [9/22] exacerbated) forms; 100 percent of the 14 patients with the Prinzmetal form had relief of the anginal episodes. In group 1, the response to exercise tests was dissociated from the short-term vasomotor pattern, and the pressure-rate product failed to explain the clinical results. Forty-five percent (ten) of the patients in group 2 showed significant short-term widening of critical stenoses, as well as obvious improvement; patients who did worse with treatment in this group had reacted to nifedipine with narrowing of critical stenoses. These data suggest that the response to nifedipine of classic effort-induced angina is probably the net result of an interaction of changes in myocardial oxygen consumption and supply; coronary vasomotion has a role in mixed angina, and influences of nifedipine may be either favorable or unfavorable; stenotic lesions in the Prinzmetal form are quite sensitive to the relaxant action of calcium blockade, and this probably represents a background to the highly positive clinical response to treatment.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the use of pressure support to compensate for the added inspiratory work of breathing due to the resistances of endotracheal tubes and a ventilator demand-valve system for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). A mechanical model was used to simulate spontaneous breathing at five respiratory rates through 7-mm, 8-mm, and 9-mm endotracheal tubes with and without a ventilator demand CPAP circuit. Added work was measured as the integral of the product of airway pressure and volume during inspiration. Additional work was a function of the tube's size, and each 1-mm decrease in the tube's diameter resulted in a 67 to 100 percent increase in work. Adding the ventilator CPAP circuit further increased work and was responsible for 30 to 50 percent of the total work resulting from a tube and CPAP circuit together. Pressure support was added to a level at which net work on the airway was zero, and a relationship between mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) and the optimal level of pressure support was established for each endotracheal tube. The inspiratory work of breathing was then measured in normal subjects breathing with and without each endotracheal tube plus the demand CPAP circuit. Work per liter of minute ventilation due to the endotracheal tube and CPAP circuit was increased from 54 to 240 percent over levels measured while breathing through an open airway. For each endotracheal tube and VT/TI, a level of pressure support (range, 2 to 20 cm H2O) was found which eliminated added work in the spontaneously breathing subject. This level correlated well with that predicted from the data derived using the mechanical model. We conclude that when adjusting for an endotracheal tube's diameter and VT/TI, pressure support can be used to compensate for the added inspiratory work due to artificial airway resistances.\r"

Tremor was reported more in the group receiving terbutaline, and nausea was reported more in the group receiving enprofylline. Two patients experienced hypotension and one patient had a vasovagal episode with enprofylline treatment.

Thirty patients with unilateral chest injury, or predominantly one-sided injuries, were investigated in the supine position, under analgesia. Right and left hemidiaphragm displacement (DD) was measured, using digital subtraction radiography, during quiet and forced breathing. The diaphragmatic contribution to breathing was determined by rib cage and abdominal circumference measurement changes. In both breathing modes, DD of the injured side was lower than DD of the uninjured side (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001). Six patients had complete diaphragmatic motionlessness. The inspired air volume due to diaphragmatic motion (Vab) was reduced when compared to normal subjects and Vab/VT ratio was always found to be less than 0.65. The degree of diaphragmatic dysfunction appeared related to injury location and is most severe in injuries of the lower chest which implies direct diaphragm muscle injury, although other mechanisms may be implicated. Diaphragmatic dysfunction can contribute to respiratory failure in these patients, and should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "The question of whether chrysotile asbestos ever causes mesothelioma in man has become a major public and occupational health issue. Review of the literature suggests that only 53 acceptable cases of chrysotile-induced mesothelioma have ever been reported; of these, 41 cases have occurred in individuals exposed to chrysotile mine dust, all of it naturally contaminated with tremolite. Ten cases have occurred in secondary industry workers, but here the suspicion of amosite or crocidolite contamination is high. Analysis of lung asbestos content indicates that induction of mesothelioma by chrysotile requires, on average, as great a lung fiber burden as induction of asbestosis by chrysotile, whereas amphibole (amosite or crocidolite)-induced mesotheliomas appear at a several hundred-fold smaller lung burden. Tremolite alone has definitely produced mesothelioma in man, particularly when exposure has been to long, high aspect ratio, fibers. Analysis of tremolite:chrysotile fiber ratios in human lung suggests that some, but not all tremolite is removed in milling chrysotile ores. The low incidence of mesothelioma in secondary chrysotile users may reflect the small amount of tremolite left in the product. These observations indicate that although chrysotile asbestos can produce mesothelioma in man, the total number of such cases is small and the required doses extremely large. The data are consistent with the idea that mesotheliomas seen in chrysotile miners and some secondary industry workers are produced by the tremolite contained in the chrysotile ore, but that the short length and low aspect ratio of the tremolite make its carcinogenicity quite low. However, these data are very indirect, and a role for the chrysotile fiber itself is still possible.\r"

A 3 to 5 day trial of high dose oral diltiazem treatment (720 mg/day maximum) is given while monitoring the patient in the clinical research center to detect significant side effects including arrhythmias, orthostatic systemic hypotension, arterial desaturation, and worsened right ventricular dysfunction. We believe it is necessary to recatheterize each patient to establish the efficacy of calcium antagonist treatment prior to discharge. Those patients who are responsive to diltiazem are discharged and followed in our pulmonary hypertension clinic. Since an occasional patient will deteriorate after several weeks of therapy, repeat right heart catheterization after 8 weeks of treatment is used to determine which patients should be continued on diltiazem for chronic therapy. Approximately 30 percent of our patients with PPH have been improved on diltiazem treatment. Most patients who have a good response to treatment after eight weeks continue to benefit from long-term treatment. It appears that the response to an acute infusion of PGI2 is useful in safely identifying those PPH patients who are likely to benefit from vasodilator therapy. Debilitated patients who are unresponsive to PGI2 and vasodilator therapy are considered potential candidates for cardiopulmonary transplantation.\r"

Further careful studies with specific mediator receptor blockers and synthesis inhibitors are required to determine if dilators play a role in maintaining the low vascular tone of the normal pulmonary circulation and if constrictors contribute to either the onset or the maintenance of the pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic airway hypoxia, lung injury, and pulmonary microembolism. It would be a mistake to summarily dismiss the possible involvement of vasoconstrictors in chronic pulmonary hypertension, but the apparent difficulty in establishing their importance emphasizes that mediators of vascular cell migration, proliferation, synthesis, and secretion may be at least as important in the etiology of the increased vascular resistance as the mediators of vascular tone.\r"

Of all patients, 35% were found to have a malignant tumor, 73% had a diagnosis as made by reference methods which was probably (18%) or definitively (55%) related to the US finding. Eighteen percent had definitive false positive findings, in 9% no final diagnosis was obtained. Thus, a positive predictive value of 80% was calculated for the US finding of a mass or a target sign related to bowel or stomach in US. The positive predictive value was lowest for target signs related to the bowel (75%) and highest for bowel conglomerates (100%). Patients with target signs of the stomach, bowel conglomerates, or masses were more likely to have malignant disorders (72%) than those with target signs related to the bowel (16%). We conclude from this study that the ultrasound finding of a target sign or a mass related to stomach or bowel has a high clinical relevance and should in any case worked up by appropriate investigations when clinical consequences are possible.\r"

TIA was not detected in any specimen from non-CF infants who had high concentration of proteins comparable to that of CF infants. Subjecting meconium supernatant of CF infants to Sephadex G-75 gel filtration revealed that TCA was greatly enhanced in effluents after fractions were activated by porcine trypsin. TCA was present in the same fractions with IRT. The findings suggested that proteases were secreted into the intestinal lumen in CF infants prior to birth. Deficient proteolysis in the disease might be due to the presence of a trypsin inhibitor.\r"

The patients had small-bowel obstruction with ileal involvement, mucosal erythema, and friability on colonoscopy with colonic involvement and an exophytic rectal mass with rectal involvement. Review of the 77 reported cases of gastrointestinal histoplasmosis shows that this is a clinical subset of disseminated histoplasmosis. With gastrointestinal involvement, pulmonary symptoms are uncommon and gastrointestinal symptoms predominate. Fever is less common than in other forms of dissemination. The most common lesions are a mass or ulcers, which often mimic inflammatory bowel disease or carcinoma. Terminal ileal involvement predominates in one third. The complement fixation test was positive in about three quarters of cases tested, but the skin test is not diagnostically useful. In one quarter of patients there is other evidence of immunosuppression. In the immunosuppressed, gastrointestinal histoplasmosis must be considered, even in a patient from a nonendemic area, who presents with lesions appearing like carcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease. When feasible, endoscopic examination and biopsy with stains and culture for histoplasmosis is recommended for diagnosis. Medical management is recommended, with surgery reserved for acute emergencies or when mandatory for diagnosis.\r"

Accurate diagnosis is the cornerstone of proper treatment; the limitations and pitfalls of conventional techniques are discussed. Current theories of the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B are reviewed to provide a framework for the use of antiviral drugs. Data from the early results of therapy with adenine arabinoside, acyclovir, and immunomodulatory agents are reviewed, and the theoretical basis for the use of alpha-interferon as well as preliminary data supporting its efficacy is presented. Strategies for the treatment of chronic delta hepatitis and chronic non-A, non-B viral hepatitis are discussed as well. The immunological changes associated with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis are described to help define those patients with chronic active hepatitis who are likely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy. The recognized hazards of long-term corticosteroid therapy are indicated and guidelines for the management of these patients are suggested. Chronic drug-induced liver disease will usually improve with cessation of the offending agent. An approach to the patient with suspected drug-induced chronic hepatitis is indicated. Finally, the role of liver transplantation is mentioned as the ultimate treatment modality available for endstage liver disease.\r"

  ".W": "The tissue and subcellular distribution of betagranin, a chromogranin A-related, cosecreted protein produced in rat insulinoma tissue, has been investigated using a combination of density gradient centrifugation, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopic techniques. Antibodies raised to insulinoma betagranin recognized antigens of the same molecular size (approximately 20,000 daltons) in insulinoma tissue and normal islets. Antigenicity was confined principally to secretory granules, and in insulinoma tissue was colocalized with insulin. Within the islet, all endocrine cells were immunoreactive, although subpopulations of beta- and alpha-cells displayed a more intense immunofluorescence. Adrenal tissue and anterior and posterior pituitaries were also highly immunoreactive, the antigen again being confined principally to the secretory granule. Higher molecular size species of 65,000, 85,000, and 100,000 daltons, which predominated in adrenal, were also present in pituitary along with equivalent amounts of the 20,000-dalton proteins. Isolated cells in the gastric antrum, small intestine, and colon were strongly immunofluorescent, but again, the molecular form differed from those of other tissues. Parallel experiments performed with antichromogranin A antisera suggested that betagranin in pancreatic B-cells is formed from chromogranin A by limited proteolysis within the secretory granule. It would appear that although chromogranin A is confined to tissues of the diffuse neuroendocrine system it can be processed differentially in tissues in this series. Potentially, the biological activity of chromogranin A resides in such derived peptides rather than in the parent molecule.\r"

  ".U": "88137126\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies with heterogeneous populations of pancreatic cells have provided evidence for the presence of somatostatin (SRIF) receptors in cytosol and secretion vesicles, as well as the plasma membrane. To examine the distribution of SRIF receptors between soluble and membrane fractions in a homogeneous pancreatic islet cell population, we have used the clonal RINm5F insulinoma cell line. These cells contain specific, high affinity binding sites for [125I-Try11]SRIF on the cell surface, and occupancy of these sites by SRIF and SRIF analogs correlates with inhibition of insulin secretion. Stable, steady state binding was achieved using both intact cells and membranes by performing binding incubations with [25I-Tyr11]SRIF at 22 C. Half-maximal inhibition of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF binding occurred with 0.21 +/- 0.11 nM SRIF in membranes and 0.35 +/- 0.30 nM SRIF in cells. In contrast, the binding of [125I-Tyr11]SRIF to cytosolic macromolecules was not reduced by concentrations of SRIF as high as 100 nM, demonstrating that this binding was of much lower affinity. RINm5F membranes were further purified using a Percoll gradient to prepare a microsomal fraction, which was enriched in adenylate cyclase activity, and a secretory granule fraction, which was enriched in insulin. [125I-Tyr11]SRIF binding to the microsomal fraction (3.8 +/- 0.3 fmol/mg) was 3 times higher than to secretion granules (1.2 +/- 0.2 fmol/mg). Thus, high affinity SRIF binding sites were most abundant in microsomal membranes and were low or undetectable in secretory granules and cytosol. To determine whether translocation of SRIF receptors to the plasma membrane accompanied insulin secretion, we examined the effects of various insulin secretagogues on [125I-Tyr11]SRIF binding to intact cells. Leucine (20 mM), glyceraldehyde (15 mM), forskolin (1 microM), and glucagon (1 microM) stimulated insulin release 1.5- to 4.0-fold in different experiments. However, these secretagogues did not increase [125I-Tyr11]SRIF binding. In summary, our results indicate that high affinity SRIF receptors in RINm5F cells are located primarily on the plasma membrane and that the concentration of SRIF receptors at the cell surface is independent of the secretory activity of the cells.\r"

Insulin stimulated incorporation by compacted 8-cell embryos, blastocysts and expanded blastocysts. The stimulation in blastocysts had an EC50 of 0.5 pM in the presence of 1 g/L BSA and was blocked by anti-human insulin anti-serum. Inclusion of insulin in the medium elevated the levels of incorporation towards those of embryos developing in vivo. The stimulation was not observed in uncompacted 8-cell embryos. The ontogeny of stimulation at compaction coincides with a switch in energy dependence from lactate and pyruvate to glucose and an increase in protein synthetic activity.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies demonstrated that the level of renin in the male submandibular gland (SMG) of mouse strains that contain renin genes [e.g. Cr1:CD-1(1CR)BR] increased dramatically at puberty, but a less pronounced response was seen in the C57BL/10J (a strain that has a single renin gene). However, the expression of renin in kidney and other extrarenal tissues throughout growth and development has not been examined. In this study we characterized developmental changes in renal renin and certain extrarenal renin levels in the male and female CD-1 mouse and male C-57 mouse. Renal renin activity remains relatively constant throughout ontogeny in male and female CD-1 mice and in the C-57 male mouse. In the CD-1 male mouse, SMG renin levels vary during ontogeny, coincident with periods in growth and development that are associated with hormonal shifts. Glandular renin levels are higher in the neonatal period than at 2-3 weeks of age, and then rise dramatically with the onset of puberty. Renin levels in the adrenal and testis of the CD-1 male mouse follow a similar temporal pattern. However, this dramatic increase in gonadal, adrenal, and SMG renin in the CD-1 male mouse at puberty is not seen in the organs from the CD-1 female mouse or those of the C-57 male mouse. Taken together, the present results demonstrated that the expression of extrarenal sources of renin is under genetic and hormonal influences. In addition, our data suggest that control of extrarenal renin expression may differ from that of renal renin.\r"

  ".W": "Male Sprague Dawley rats were chronically pair-fed with liquid diets containing 6.5% (vol/vol) ethanol, or equicaloric sucrose. After 21 days the ethanol-containing diet was discontinued and both groups were fed the sucrose diet. Groups of animals were killed on day 22 (0 day of ethanol withdrawal) and 1, 3, 8, and 15 days after ethanol withdrawal and the neurointermediate lobes (NILs) were removed and incubated with [3H]phenylalanine for 3 h. Chronic ethanol treatment induced an increase in the biosynthesis and release of beta-endorphin-like peptides by the rat NIL. After ethanol withdrawal the beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity content in the NIL and the in vitro release of immunoreactive beta-endorphin (beta EP) by the NIL were significantly lower than in the controls on the first day, whereas no significant difference was found on days 3, 8, and 15 after ethanol withdrawal. The in vitro incorporation of [3H]phenylalanine into POMC, beta-lipotropin and beta EP was found to be higher in the ethanol-treated animals than in the controls on days 0, 1, and 3 after ethanol withdrawal, with no significant difference on days 8 and 15 after ethanol withdrawal. Furthermore, in both the ethanol-treated animals and their pair-fed controls the rate of incorporation of [3H]phenylalanine into total proteins, POMC, beta-lipotropin, and beta EP was significantly higher on days 8 and 15 after ethanol withdrawal than on the day of ethanol withdrawal (day 0), suggesting the implication of a nutritional factor. HPLC analysis of the beta EP peptides indicated that the percentage of acetylated forms of beta EP was higher in the NIL of the alcohol-treated animals, especially on days 8 and 15 after ethanol withdrawal. This observation suggests that though the rates of biosynthesis and release of beta EP-related peptides have returned to normal at 15 days after ethanol treatment, the activity of the enzyme responsible for the acetylation of beta EP remained elevated.\r"

  ".W": "Eight female and eight male New Zealand White rabbits were outfitted with push-pull cannulae aimed at the tuberal region of the hypothalamus and were used in 19 perfusion experiments. Animals were treated under 2 conditions: a control condition in which female (n = 4) and male (n = 4) rabbits were perfused only with artificial medium for 5-9 h, and an experimental condition in which female (n = 4) and male (n = 5) rabbits were subjected to perfusion with artificial medium, followed by 6 pulses of progesterone (P4) (10 min on, 30 min off; 10 ng/ml) during a 240-min period. Two female rabbits were also subjected to perfusion with artificial medium, followed by 6 pulses of cholesterol (10 min on, 30 min off; 10 ng/ml) during a 240-min period. The LHRH concentration in perfusates collected every 10 min was measured by RIA. In the 4 females undergoing 6- to 7-h control push-pull perfusions, spontaneous pulses were observed, with about 1 pulse every 60 min, and a variable amplitude of the LHRH signal, with a mean release of about 0.91 pg/10 min. In the 4 does treated with pulsatile P4 at 10 ng/ml, the mean LHRH release rate increased significantly from 0.91 +/- 0.13 to 1.66 +/- 0.20 pg/10 min (P less than 0.035), primarily due to an increase in the amplitude of the LHRH pulses, which were significantly greater than controls. This response occurred with an apparent mean latency of about 50 min. Cholesterol pulses did not affect the spontaneous activity of the LHRH neural apparatus. In the 4 males undergoing 5- to 9-h control push-pull perfusions, spontaneous LHRH pulses were observed with about 1 pulse every 60 min, and the mean release increased from 1.25 +/- 0.56 to 1.54 +/- 0.55 (P less than 0.035, by Wilcoxon's matched pairs signed rank test) in the late afternoon primarily due to an increase in the amplitude of the pulses. P4 pulses did not affect the spontaneous activity of the LHRH neural apparatus compared to that in the control animals. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that although spontaneous pulsatile LHRH release from the hypothalamus of awake unrestrained female and male rabbits is similar, pulses of P4 can activate only the female LHRH neural apparatus, with an apparent latency to peak LHRH release of approximately 50 min. In addition, there appears to be an increase in LHRH mean release levels in the late afternoon to early evening in male rabbits.\r"

Consequently, this study was designed to determine the effects of ACTH and other POMC-derived peptides on testosterone secretion by the in vitro perfused testis. Infusion of synthetic human ACTH-(1-24) at a concentration of 500 ng/ml increased (P less than 0.01) testosterone secretion over that in nontreated controls by in vitro perfused rabbit and guinea pig testes, but not by rat, hamster, or dog testes. This increase in testosterone secretion after ACTH treatment, however, was less (P less than 0.01) than that after the infusion of a maximally stimulating concentration of ovine LH (100 ng/ml). Using rabbit testes, the testosterone response to ACTH was demonstrated to be dose dependent and specific, since similar responses were observed after the infusion of synthetic human ACTH-(1-39) and purified porcine ACTH-(1-39) and since no response was observed after the infusion of a variety of ACTH fragments. Infusion of alpha MSH, beta-endorphin, or naloxone had no effect (P greater than 0.10) on testosterone secretion by either rabbit or rat testes at the doses used.

In contrast, treatment of rat adipocyte membranes with 0.5-2.0 mM DTT increased tracer insulin binding 3- to 6-fold, while higher levels of DTT (10 mM) also fully inhibited insulin binding. Scatchard analysis of insulin binding revealed that DTT treatment of adipocyte membranes resulted in an increase in both the high and low affinity dissociation constants. Purification of adipocyte insulin receptors by wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography, followed by insulin-agarose affinity chromatography, resulted in loss of DTT stimulation of insulin binding. Comparison of insulin receptors purified from rat adipocytes or human placenta membranes revealed no significant differences in the DTT sensitivities of insulin binding or protein kinase activities. These data suggest that the functional properties of the rat adipocyte insulin receptor are modified by its membrane environment compared to those of insulin receptors in placenta membranes or purified insulin receptors in detergent solution.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the mode of morphine's (M) action to increase the sensitivity of castrated male rats to the inhibitory feedback action of testosterone (T) on LH release. In castrated rats, sc implantation of M pellets or 5-mm long T-filled capsules (T5) failed to suppress LH release, but a combination of M and T5 drastically decreased serum LH levels. Likewise, while treatment with a higher dose of T (30-mm long implant, sc) suppressed LH release, combined treatment with M and T30 produced a further suppression of LH levels. We have now assessed the in vitro release rate of LHRH from the medial basal hypothalamus-preoptic area of castrated rats treated with M and/or T as well as the in vivo pituitary LH response to LHRH challenge in similarly treated rats. Interestingly, the in vitro basal and naloxone-induced LHRH release from the medial basal hypothalamus-preoptic area of the six groups of rats was similar, regardless of whether LH levels were in the high castrate or low basal range. On the other hand, M treatment greatly attenuated LH release in vivo in response to LHRH challenge (10pmol-1pmol) [corrected] in T-treated rats. In fact, LH increments in response to 1pmol [corrected] LHRH, seen in control, T5, and T30 groups, were abolished by additional M treatment of T-treated rats. This in vitro assessment of LHRH release suggests that the drastic decrease in LH release in T-plus M-treated rats may not be due to impaired LHRH release, but, rather, be due in part to reduced pituitary responsiveness to intermittent endogenous LHRH signals. The reduced pituitary responsiveness to LHRH in T-plus M-treated rats may be a consequence of either a direct pituitary effect of opiates in conjunction with T or augmented action of hypothalamic neurohumoral agents which may inhibit LH release on their own or antagonize the LH-releasing action of LHRH at the level of pituitary gonadotrophs.\r"

In 60 cycles, the luteal phase was supported by hCG, 1500 IU three times at 2-day intervals from the day of ET. The remaining 56 cycles served as controls. hCG significantly increased the P level (93 +/- 53 versus 62 +/- 46 ng/ml), the P/E2 ratio, and the luteal phase length (17.4 +/- 1.3 versus 12.2 +/- 1.7 days). However, the total pregnancy rate did not significantly differ between the two groups, though the pregnancy rate after transfer of two or three embryos was slightly higher in the hCG group (26.9 versus 22% in the control group), as was the rate of implanted embryo per transferred embryo after transfer of two or three embryos (25 versus 15.3%). It was concluded that, while hCG increased the magnitude and duration of the luteal P secretion, it did not clearly improve the pregnancy rate.\r"

Given the advantages (less risk, lower cost, and greater patient acceptance) of these alternative techniques, it is appropriate to assess their efficacy compared with traditional laparoscopic retrieval. This article examines the recovery rate of oocytes and their subsequent fertilization rate with the use of an ultrasonic endovaginal transducer with fixed needle guide and compares these results with other retrieval methods. Comparisons were made between laparoscopic harvesting (n = 71, group I), ultrasonic transabdominal transvesical (n = 21, group II), and ultrasonic vaginal transducer (n = 76, group III). The data demonstrate comparable success using an ultrasonic endovaginal transducer with fixed needle guide. The authors believe this technique to be the procedure of choice for all routine oocyte retrievals during IVF treatment.\r"

Ultrasound-directed oocyte recovery (UDOR) was performed as an ambulatory procedure in 1737 (77.8%) cycles, resulting in 1375 embryos transfers (ET). Age, etiology, menstrual cycle length, number of oocytes collected, and number of embryos transferred were important determinants of the outcome. The number of attempts at in vitro fertilization did not affect the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR). In patients receiving four embryos, the CPR appeared to be highest when up to seven embryos were available for transfer. The fertilization rate in an individual cycle had a good prognostic value, the implantation rate being highest when 7 to 9 oocytes were retrieved and greater than 60% of these were fertilized. When 10 or more oocytes were collected, the implantation rate showed a progressive decline, regardless of the fertilization rate. Furthermore, multiple pregnancies failed to occur when greater than 12 oocytes were retrieved or more than eight embryos were available for transfer. These data suggest that, in excessively stimulated cycles, the quality of oocytes and embryos or uterine receptiveness may be suboptimal, and the transfer of more than four embryos is unlikely to increase the success rate.\r"

The salting out method and the buccal epithelial cell technique were used respectively. E coli isolated from colitics are significantly more hydrophobic than control E coli (p less than 0.001). The salting out score correlates negatively with the buccal epithelial cell adhesion index. When E coli are grown at 18 degrees C both properties are temporarily reduced suggesting that they are related to each other. The salting out method clearly differentiates between E coli isolated from colitics and controls, and offers a simple method of detecting adhesive E coli in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

  ".W": "Aggregating platelets release serotonin, which induces contraction of most vascular smooth muscle by activation of S2-serotoninergic receptors. Serotonin released in the circulation may contribute to the increase in peripheral resistance of hypertension as the responsiveness of blood vessels from hypertensive animals and humans to the vasoconstrictor action of the monoamine is augmented. The data obtained with the new antihypertensive agent ketanserin may favor that interpretation. Ketanserin is a selective S2-serotoninergic antagonist with additional alpha 1-adrenergic blocking properties. In humans, it has a terminal half-life of 12 to 25 hours and is eliminated predominantly by the liver. The hemodynamic profile of ketanserin is that of a vasodilator drug with actions on both resistance and capacitance vessels. On short-term intravenous administration, it lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients with minimal reflex changes in cardiovascular function. When given orally long term to hypertensive patients, ketanserin causes a sustained reduction in arterial blood pressure, comparable to that obtained with either beta-adrenergic blockers or diuretics. Several studies have shown a greater efficacy in older (greater than 60 years of age) than in younger patients independent of starting pressure. Side effects mainly consist of dizziness, somnolence, and dry mouth, but they are usually not severe. The mechanism underlying the antihypertensive effect of ketanserin is unclear. It cannot be attributed to either S2-serotoninergic or alpha 1-adrenergic blockade alone, but an interaction between the two effects appears to be required.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that captopril stimulates thromboxane A2 synthesis in patients with essential hypertension. In the present study, the hypotensive effects of captopril and OKY-046, a selective inhibitor of thromboxane A2 synthetase, were studied in nine patients with essential hypertension to determine whether thromboxane A2 is involved in the regulation of blood pressure. A single oral dose of OKY-046 (400 mg) decreased urinary thromboxane B2 (a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2) excretion significantly (from 113 +/- 19.0 to 51.0 +/- 6.1 pg/min; p less than 0.01) and increased urinary sodium excretion significantly (from 73.0 +/- 15.3 to 113.0 +/- 14.4 microEq/min; p less than 0.01), but no change was observed in mean arterial pressure. The administration of OKY-046 (600 mg/day) for 3 days induced a significant and sustained decrease in urinary thromboxane B2 excretion, but it did not affect the mean arterial pressure. Although captopril (50 mg) alone induced a significant increase in urinary thromboxane B2 excretion (from 91.4 +/- 11.0 to 297.3 +/- 30.8 pg/min; p less than 0.001) and a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (from 97.0 +/- 4.7 to 88.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg; p less than 0.01), captopril in combination with OKY-046 induced a decrease both in urinary thromboxane B2 excretion (from 70.8 +/- 12.3 to 54.2 +/- 14.7 pg/min; p less than 0.01) and in mean arterial pressure (from 105.1 +/- 3.8 to 84.2 +/- 3.6 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Thus, the hypotensive effect of captopril was potentiated by OKY-046. OKY-046 did not affect the changes in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration and blunted urinary prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha excretion in response to captopril. These results indicate that thromboxane A2 counteracts the hypotensive effect of captopril in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

Both methods of blood pressure measurement demonstrated an antihypertensive effect of the diuretics chlorthalidone (25 mg) and triamterene (50 mg) and the beta-blocker oxprenolol (160 mg) and the greater efficacy of the combination of the two therapies. During placebo, as well as during active treatment, blood pressure values were higher at the clinic than at home, except when the patients were taking the beta-blocker, which minimized the arousal response during blood pressure measurements in the clinic. With 2-week treatment periods, separated by 2 weeks of placebo administration, blood pressure returned toward its initial level after each of the three treatments and none of the carryover effects was significant at the 5% level. This methodology was intended to make it possible to demonstrate in 27 patients at the clinic and in 20 patients with measurements made at home, at the usual statistical risks (alpha = 5%, beta = 10%), a fall of 5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure in comparison with a placebo. Moreover, at the end of this 3-month follow-up, each patient could continue to receive the treatment that was the most effective and the best tolerated. In conclusion, the use of a within-patient trial design, with a 15-day washout period between active treatments and careful recording of blood pressure values, can minimize the number of patients included in hypertension trials and offer to each patient the possibility of individualization of treatment.\r"

Sixteen patients were included in a randomized crossover trial of enalapril, 20 mg daily, and diltiazem, 120 mg daily, for 6 weeks each.

Nifedipine and enalaprilat reduced blood pressure equally well. The long-term blood pressure reduction induced by enalapril and diltiazem was similar. The acute blood pressure response to a given drug was not a good predictor of the result obtained with long-term therapy. No age dependency of the antihypertensive effect of either drug class was apparent. There was no evidence that a good response to one drug excluded a similarly good response to the other.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine acts at many sites to modulate neuronal activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible role for adenosine as a neuromodulator of brainstem cardiovascular control. Microinjections of adenosine (0-2.3 nmol) were made stereotaxically into various brainstem sites. Injection of adenosine into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) produced dose-related decreases in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Maximal changes occurred 90 seconds after injection. Injection into the area postrema also produced decreased heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. No significant effect occurred following injection into the C1 area. Adenosine 5'-triphosphate and its analogue, beta, gamma-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate also produced dose-related and potent vasodepressor and bradycardia effects in the NTS. Injection of 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine (0.92 nmol), a potent adenosine receptor antagonist, produced no effect itself, but abolished for 45 minutes the actions of further injections of adenosine and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (but not L-glutamate) in both the NTS and area postrema. Thus, NTS and area postrema injections of adenosine decrease blood pressure and heart rate in anesthetized normotensive rats through adenosine receptors located in these areas. These findings support a role for endogenous adenosine as a central modulator in cardiovascular control.\r"

This method is highly sensitive and specific for cells capable of synthesizing LPL in significant quantities. Pubescence in female rats was associated with an increase in differentiated preadipocytes and in fat cell number with enlargement of the fat depots in the perirenal, parametrial, and the subcutaneous dorsal and femoral regions. A concomitant decline in the percentage of undifferentiated preadipocytes occurred in all but the femoral depot. Ovariectomy reduced pubertal adipose growth in the femoral and parametrial but not the dorsal or perirenal regions. Furthermore, the femoral undifferentiated preadipocyte pool was not preserved in the ovariectomized animals. Thus, ovarian factors influence the pubescence-associated regional preadipocyte differentiation and conversion to adipocytes. The femoral depot contains an ovarian-dependent infinite pool of fat cell precursors. These features could account for the association between ovarian hormones and body fat topography.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism whereby the human neutrophil membrane heterodimer, CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, Mo1), mediates neutrophil adherence is not known. We studied the role of CD11b/CD18 surface expression in the promotion of neutrophil adhesiveness. We found that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore (A23187), and FMLP caused a three- to sevenfold increase in surface expression of both CD11b (alpha M) and CD18 (beta) as assayed by binding of MAbs 60.1 (anti-CD11b) and 60.3 (anti-CD18). Increased binding of MAbs was temporally associated with the promotion of neutrophil aggregation and adherence to cultured endothelial monolayers. Pretreatment of neutrophils with the anion channel-blocking agent, DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid), inhibited the increased surface expression of CD11b and CD18 after stimulation by PMA, A23187, or FMLP and resulted in nearly complete inhibition of neutrophil aggregation. However, pretreatment with DIDS did not diminish either PMA-, A23187-, or FMLP-stimulated neutrophil adherence to endothelial monolayers. We also observed that stimulation of granule-depleted neutrophil cytoplasts by PMA, A23187, or FMLP induced aggregation and adherence to endothelial monolayers without increasing surface expression of CD11b or CD18. We conclude that the increased surface expression of CD11b/CD18 that occurs after stimulation is neither sufficient nor necessary for enhanced adherence to endothelium. Moreover, though both are CD11b/CD18-dependent, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil aggregation are different from those involved in neutrophil adherence to endothelium.\r"

Western immunoblots of the EBA antigen extracted from skin and of type VII procollagen labeled with the above sera and antibodies are identical.

  ".U": "88139787\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelial cells are a known source of hematopoietic growth-enhancing factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). In addition, endothelium interacts directly with plasma lipoproteins which have been shown to modulate hematopoiesis. To determine the relationship of these properties, we measured the release of an erythroid growth-enhancing factor from bovine endothelial cells under lipid-loaded and control conditions. Human bone marrow cells cultured under serum-free conditions form more erythroid, granulocyte/macrophage, and mixed hematopoietic colonies when supplemented with endothelial cell-conditioned medium (ECCM) than do controls (P less than 0.05). The activity is expressed over a wide range of erythropoietin, lymphocyte-conditioned medium (LCM), recombinant human interleukin-3, and colony-stimulating factor (CSF) concentrations, and is related to ECCM dose. In contrast, enhancing activity in ECCM prepared with 0-400 micrograms/ml acetylated low density lipoproteins (AcLDL) or native LDL is diminished to 0% in a dose-dependent fashion (relative to ECCM from unexposed cells or from cells incubated with very low density lipoproteins, P less than 0.05). Upon dilution, medium prepared from cells incubated with LDL shows a rightward shift in the dose-response curve for erythroid colony formation, while that prepared from AcLDL loaded cells demonstrates a downward shift, indicating that the inhibitory activities are kinetically distinct. Delipidation of ECCM prior to addition to marrow culture removes the inhibitory action of native LDL (P less than 0.05) but not that of AcLDL (P greater than 0.10). Immunochemical analysis suggests that the erythropoietic activity in ECCM is unrelated to that of PDGF, recombinant human CSF, and erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) present in LCM. This conclusion is supported by Northern blot analysis of endothelial cells using a cDNA probe for the v-sis homologue of the PDGF beta chain and by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled PDGF. The relative amounts of c-sis transcripts and of secreted PDGF were similar in endothelial cells incubated with or without AcLDL. We conclude that AcLDL impair the synthesis or release of an erythropoietic growth-enhancing factor(s) which is biologically distinct from PDGF and BPA present in LCM.\r"

To investigate the possible role of S fimbriae in determining the tissue tropism of neonatal meningitis, we have studied the presence of binding sites for S fimbriae in different tissues of the neonatal rat which is susceptible to meningitis caused by S-fimbriated E. coli. Purified S fimbriae were incubated on cryostat sections of different rat organs and their binding was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. In the brain of the neonatal rat, S fimbriae specifically bound to the luminal surfaces of the vascular endothelium and of the epithelium lining the choroid plexuses and brain ventricles. The binding was completely inhibited by the trisaccharide NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4Glc, a receptor analogue of S fimbriae, and by a preceding neuraminidase treatment of the sections. A recombinant E. coli strain expressing S fimbriae adhered in large numbers to the same tissue sites in the neonatal brain sections as did the purified fimbriae, whereas the non-fimbriated host strain and a recombinant strain expressing P fimbriae did not adhere to brain tissues. The results suggest that adhesion of S-fimbriated bacteria to the binding sites observed in the neonatal brain has a pathogenetic role during bacterial invasion from circulation into the cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

  ".W": "A patient with a mild hemolytic anemia and osmotically fragile, spherocytic erythrocytes was studied. Analysis of the erythrocyte membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE revealed a deficiency of protein 4.2 (less than 0.10% of normal). The protein 4.2-deficient erythrocytes contained normal amounts of all other membrane proteins, although the amount of band 3 was slightly reduced and the amount of band 6 (G3PD) was slightly elevated. The spectrin content of these cells was normal, as measured by both SDS-PAGE and radioimmunoassay. Erythrocytes from the patient's biologic parents were hematologically normal and contained normal amounts of protein 4.2. Immunological analysis using affinity purified antibodies revealed that the patient's protein 4.2 was composed of equal amounts of a 74-kD and 72-kD protein doublet, whereas the normal protein was composed primarily of a 72-kD monomer. Proteolytic digestion studies using trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin and papain demonstrated that the patient's protein 4.2 was similar but not identical to the normal protein. Binding studies showed that the protein 4.2-deficient membranes bound purified protein 4.2 to the same extent as normal membranes, suggesting that the membrane binding site(s) for the protein were normal. Depleting the protein 4.2-deficient membranes of spectrin and actin resulted in a loss of nearly two-thirds of the membrane ankyrin, whereas similar depletion of normal membranes resulted in no loss of ankyrin. Repletion of the protein 4.2-deficient membranes with purified protein 4.2 before spectrin-actin extraction partially prevented the loss of ankyrin. These results suggest that protein 4.2 may function to stabilize ankyrin on the erythrocyte membrane.\r"
