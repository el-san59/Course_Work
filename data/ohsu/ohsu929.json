  ".W": "The effect of almitrine bismesylate on the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response was studied in six closed-chest dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital and paralyzed with pancuronium. The right lung was ventilated continuously with 100% O2; the left lung was ventilated either with 100% O2 (\"hyperoxia\") or with an hypoxic gas mixture (\"hypoxia\": end-tidal oxygen tension = 60.3 +/- 0.6 mm Hg). On two consecutive days, each dog received either almitrine (Vectarion, Servier Lab) or malic acid. Consecutive almitrine doses of 0.003, 0.03, 0.3, and 3.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, or the equivalent volumes of malic acid without almitrine, were administered intravenously as a constant peripheral infusion for 15 min. Percent blood flow to each lung was calculated based on a variation of the traditional shunt equation. The change in percent left lung blood flow (delta %QL-VA) increased significantly between the hypoxia-no drug and the hypoxia-almitrine (3.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) phase. No significant changes occurred during the other almitrine doses or the respective malic acid control phases. The change in arterial oxygen tension (delta PaO2) also increased significantly between the hypoxia-no drug and the hypoxia-almitrine (3.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) phase. No significant changes occurred during the other almitrine doses or the respective malic acid control phases. It is concluded that in dogs low-dose almitrine enhances hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that this enhancement is dose-related.\r"

  ".W": "Verapamil clearance is reduced during halothane administration. This study evaluated relative contributions of reduced hepatic flow rate and hepatic metabolizing enzyme inhibition by halothane as a cause of reduced verapamil clearance. An isolated perfused rat liver model was utilized in which flow rate could be fixed during halothane administration. Perfusions were performed on five to six livers under each of the following conditions: (a) control--40 mL/min flow rate with no anesthetic exposure; (b) 1.5% halothane--40 mL/min; (c) 2.25% halothane--40 mL/min; (d) reduced flow--20 mL/min with no anesthetic exposure; and (e) reduced flow with 1.5% halothane--20 mL/min. Halothane caused dose-dependent decreases in both total hepatic and intrinsic clearance rates (P less than 0.05). With no anesthetic exposure, a flow reduction of 50% (20 mL/min) also gave a large reduction (P less than 0.05) in hepatic clearance of verapamil compared with the control condition (40 mL/min). The addition of 1.5% halothane to the reduced flow condition was not associated with further reduction in hepatic clearance rate. Results of this study suggest that although both reduced hepatic perfusion and hepatic enzymatic inhibition by halothane administration are associated with decreased verapamil clearance, a greater proportion of this decrease appears to be due to reductions in hepatic flow. The present results may apply to other drugs used in anesthesia that have high hepatic extraction ratios; thus, clearance of these drugs may be more dependent on hepatic blood flow than on hepatic enzyme activity.\r"

The neuromuscular responses to the two most commonly employed modes of DBS stimulation, DBS3,3 and DBS3,2, and the responses to TOF nerve stimulation were recorded and compared at 20, 30, and 50 mA. Twenty-two consenting patients undergoing general anesthesia received a vecuronium infusion to achieve a TOF ratio within the range of 0.1-1.0. Train-of-four, DBS3,3, and DBS3,2 were delivered at 20, 30, and 50 mA in random sequence after a steady state of neuromuscular blockade was achieved. At a stimulating current of 50 mA, there was a significant linear correlation between DBS3,3 and TOF (P less than 0.0001; r = 0.98) over the range of blockade. Similarly, there was a high degree of correlation between DBS3,2 and TOF at 50 mA, as the increased \"fade\" associated with DBS3,2 was maintained throughout the spectrum of blockade (P less than 0.0001; r = 0.95). The high degrees of correlation were maintained at stimulating currents of 20 and 30 mA (P less than 0.0001). In conclusion, the present study revealed that there is a high degree of linear correlation between DBS and TOF, and that this mechanographic relationship is maintained over a wide range of stimulating currents during varying degrees of clinical neuromuscular blockade.\r"

The current study therefore compared the effects of prostaglandin E1, an effective pulmonary vasodilator, with the effects of the water-soluble calcium channel blocker diltiazem during pulmonary hypertension in sheep. Pulmonary hypertension was produced by continuous intravenous administration of U46619 to halothane-anesthetized sheep. Prostaglandin E1 decreased pulmonary artery pressure 29%, decreased pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) 57%, and did not affect the ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance (Rp/Rs). Diltiazem decreased pulmonary artery pressure 15%, decreased Rp 50%, and did not affect Rp/Rs. When 0.33 mL/kg polyethylene glycol-ethanol vehicle (the vehicle used for nifedipine administration in a prior study) was administered during diltiazem infusion, pulmonary artery pressure increased 19%, Rp increased 72%, and Rp/Rs increased 29%. These results indicate that diltiazem is an effective pulmonary vasodilator and suggest that the previously reported unfavorable results of nifedipine may have been due to the vehicle used for nifedipine administration.\r"

The present study compares the kinetics and dynamics of doxacurium in eight ASA physical status I or II elderly patients (67-72 yr of age) and eight ASA I or II young patients (22-49 yr of age). After institutionally approved written informed consent, kinetic and dynamic measurements were made after a 25-micrograms/kg bolus injection of doxacurium during 1.25 MAC nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoflurane anesthesia. Maximum twitch depression was similar in older patients (96.4% +/- 1.3%) to that in the young patients (96.6% +/- 1.8%). The time to achieve this level of block was significantly longer in the elderly than in the young (11.2 +/- 1.1 min versus 7.7 +/- 1.0 min, respectively). Recovery times to twitch heights of 5% and 25% of control tended to be prolonged and were more variable in the elderly (82.6 +/- 17.2 and 97.1 +/- 20.1 min, respectively) than in the young (54.8 +/- 9 and 67.5 +/- 8.2 min, respectively). Elimination half-life (96 +/- 20 min) and clearance (2.47 +/- 0.69 mL.kg-1.min-1) in the elderly patients were not statistically different from values found in the younger group. Volume of distribution at steady state in the elderly (220 +/- 80.2 mL/kg) was significantly larger than in the young (150 +/- 40.0 mL/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity increased significantly from 52 +/- 6 (SEM) to 82 +/- 24 cm/s (an increase of 58% +/- 13%) within 4 +/- 1 min after tourniquet release and remained significantly elevated for 7 min. A positive linear correlation was found between middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity and PETCO2 on each occasion (0.97 greater than or equal to r greater than or equal to 0.84, 0.001 greater than P greater than 0.0001) after tourniquet deflation. Assuming a linear relationship between flow velocity and flow, these findings suggest that significant increase in cerebral blood flow can occur after intraoperative tourniquet release and that this increase appears to be mostly CO2-dependent.\r"

Twenty children received 3 mg.kg-1.min-1 of propofol as a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 (+/- 10%). Twenty children received 5-7 mg/kg of thiopental, and maintenance was provided with halothane (0.5%-1.5%). The interval between the end of the administration of propofol or thiopental/halothane and extubation, as well to discharge to the ward, was significantly shorter with propofol (4.4 versus 13.5 min and 7.22 versus 30.4 min, respectively). Spontaneous movements and pain on injection were seen significantly more frequently with propofol, whereas laryngospasm and hiccup were only observed with thiopental. During the first 6 h after the surgical procedure, analgesics were needed significantly more often in the thiopental group. Nausea and vomiting also were observed more frequently in the thiopental group. In conclusion, propofol used as a single anesthetic is a satisfactory technique for ENT surgery of short duration in children.\r"

Twenty-four elderly patients (greater than or equal to 65 yr) presenting for elective orthopedic surgery were randomly allocated to receive either 3-min or four-maximal-breaths of 100% O2 via a Bain circuit. After preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced, tracheal intubation performed with patients kept apneic, and the endotracheal tube left open to air. The arterial O2 saturation was measured before preoxygenation and continually recorded during desaturation. Although attaining similar arterial O2 saturation values after preoxygenation, patients in the four-maximal-breath group had significantly shorter times (P less than 0.0001) to all levels of desaturation. We suggest that preoxygenation with 3-min breathing of 100% O2 offers more protection against hypoxia due to prolonged apnea after induction of anesthesia in the elderly than does four maximal breaths of 100% O2.\r"

The markers of myocardial ischemia included levels of adenosine triphosphate, its catabolites, and creatine phosphate in transmural left ventricular biopsy specimens taken at the beginning and end of CPB, as well as hemodynamic recovery during weaning from CPB and for the next 24 h. The intravenous infusion of carnitine (3 or 6 g) had no hemodynamic effect. At the end of CPB myocardial tissue levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate did not differ significantly among the groups (P greater than 0.05). Recovery of cardiac function during weaning from CPB and for the following 24 h was similar in all three groups (P greater than 0.05). It is concluded that pretreatment with carnitine neither facilitates weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery nor favorably affects hemodynamic function during the next 24 h.\r"

X-ray examination performed on the second and 30th days after the implantation indicated free spread of the injected solution in the subarachnoid space without any obstruction. Repeated injections of four identical doses of bupivacaine at 3-day intervals showed reproducible pharmacologic effects. Administration of different doses of the anesthetic produced a clear dose-response relationship. The relative activity of the anesthetic agents was found to be identical to that previously obtained in humans. No significant complications after the implantation have been recorded. We suggest the current model as an additional appropriate tool for the investigation of spinal anesthesia.\r"

At induction the study group received 10% Intralipid (3 mL/min for 20 min). The control group received 5% dextrose in lactated Ringer's solution at the same rate. Other drugs administered during or after anesthesia were similar among the groups. The groups were similar with respect to duration of anesthesia, characteristics of early and intermediate recovery, as well as pain scores in the postanesthesia care unit. There were no differences in the amount of antiemetic medications administered or postoperative nausea, retching, or vomiting when the patients were evaluated objectively by a blinded observer or subjectively by patient self-evaluation.

Using an in vitro animal model, this study attempts to elucidate the mechanism of hormonal effects on nerve conduction in desheathed rabbit vagus nerve. The acute effects of progesterone administration on neural blockade induced by bupivacaine were investigated in terms of changes in compound action potentials of A, B, and C fibers. No change in baseline compound action potential was found after 30 min of perfusion of the nerve with progesterone. Exposure of the nerve to progesterone before exposure to bupivacaine did not significantly increase the degree of conduction blockade produced by bupivacaine, and a radioactive assay demonstrated that progesterone was taken up acutely by neural tissue over a 45-min measurement period. These results indicate that although progesterone was taken up in significant amounts by neural tissue, an acute exposure does not increase the sensitivity of the nerves to bupivacaine. Hence, the increased sensitivity of nerves to local anesthetics seen with pregnancy or with chronic progesterone treatment requires some period of time to occur. The mechanism is therefore unlikely to be a direct effect of progesterone on the cell membrane but may involve hormonal effects on protein synthesis.\r"

A common protocol involves establishing a baseline ACT before administering heparin, then using this ACT as a target value for assessing the adequacy of heparin neutralization after cardiopulmonary bypass. Results vary in previous comparisons of baseline ACT to postprotamine ACT, with some showing postprotamine ACT significantly below baseline values. The present study examined ACTs at three possible baseline intervals in 68 patients at two institutions: (a) before anesthetic induction; (b) after anesthetic induction; and (c) after sternotomy. Baseline ACT decreased significantly with anesthesia and surgery. The poststernotomy baseline ACT best matched the postprotamine ACT. It appears likely that surgery induces a thromboplastic response that decreases ACT. Establishing baseline ACT before anesthetic induction would predispose to false diagnoses of adequate protamine neutralization after cardiopulmonary bypass, because ACT is relatively insensitive to low concentrations of unneutralized heparin. Baseline ACTs should therefore be measured after surgical incision.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of the influence of respiration was carried out in three patients with artificial hearts. During spontaneous ventilation, large swings in intrathoracic pressure can produce a pattern reminiscent of pulsus paradoxus in the systemic arterial pressure. A decrease in intrathoracic pressure decreased biventricular filling and enhanced biventricular emptying. An increase in intrathoracic pressure increased biventricular filling, but acting as an increased afterload, impeded biventricular emptying. The influence of respiration on the artificial heart can be considered the result of the artificial ventricles' functioning effectively as extrathoracic pumps, such that changes in intrathoracic pressure produce gradients for biventricular filling and ejection relative to atmospheric pressure (which serves as the reference pressure for the artificial ventricles). Respiratory-induced variation in ventricular performance is clearly present with the artificial heart, but the mechanisms producing these changes appear to be markedly different from normal conditions, in which the ventricles are functionally within the thorax and have a compliant common septum allowing ventricular interaction.\r"

Following routine aspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid, 1 ml of air was injected through each epidural catheter while heart tones were continually monitored with a Doppler ultrasound probe placed over the maternal precordium. In 281 patients, Doppler heart tones did not change following air injection (negative air test). All but eight of these patients developed an adequate level of analgesia following anesthetic administration, and no patients with negative air tests developed signs or symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity (false-negative rate, 0%; 95% confidence limits, 0.0-1.1%). Doppler heart tone changes followed air injection in 22 cases (positive air test). In 16 of these, intravenous catheter position was subsequently shown by aspiration of blood from the catheter or by the use of test doses consisting of local anesthetics with or without epinephrine. In six cases, adequate levels of analgesia developed despite a positive air test (false-positive rate, 2%; 95% confidence limit, 0.7-4.3%). None of the 303 patients receiving the air test developed any complications attributable to the injection of air (95% confidence limits, 0.0-1.0%). The authors conclude that air, with precordial Doppler detection, is a safe and effective test for identifying intravenously located epidural catheters.\r"

Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide in oxygen, flunitrazepam, and fentanyl. Of 14 patients given atracurium, seven were given prior administration of succinylcholine and seven were not. Interaction between the two drugs was quantified by determining the asymptotic steady-state rate of infusion necessary to produce a constant 90% neuromuscular blockade. This was accomplished by applying nonlinear curve-fitting to data on the cumulative dose requirement during anesthesia. The neuromuscular blocking effect of atracurium was found to be greater after prior administration of succinylcholine. The asymptotic steady-state rate of infusion (+/- SD) for atracurium was 0.27 +/- 0.06 mg.kg-1.h-1 for patients given succinylcholine and 0.38 +/- 0.10 mg.kg-1.h-1 for those not given succinylcholine. The clinical implication of this study is that the clinician should be aware of the fact that an induction dose of 1 mg/kg of succinylcholine does reduce atracurium requirement for 90% neuromuscular blockade by approximately 30%.\r"

We recommend that specific precautions be adopted for the various procedures and discuss precautions that could have prevented contact with body fluid.\r"

Mean (+/- SD) minimum nasopharyngeal, esophageal, and rectal temperatures of 16.4 +/- 2.2, 11.2 +/- 2.7, and 17.7 +/- 1.9 degrees C, respectively, were achieved for a mean duration of PHCA of 51.6 +/- 18.7 min. AFP increased significantly above pre-CPB values for the first 21.7 +/- 8.1 min of rewarming. The duration of this increase in AFP was related logarithmically and directly to the product of the nasopharyngeal temperature (NPT) at the end of PHCA and the duration of PHCA (r2 = 0.82, P less than 0.0001). Nineteen of these patients had simultaneous monitoring of VEPs. The latency of both the N70 and P100 components of the VEPs increased as temperature decreased. The cerebral perfusion pressure was linearly and inversely related to the AFP (r2 = 0.72, P less than 0.01). The VEPs disappeared as a nasopharyngeal temperature (NPT) of 18.9 +/- 2.8 degrees C and reappeared after 21.9 +/- 8.8 min post-PHCA at an NPT of 32.8 +/- 1.4 degrees C. There was no significant difference between duration of increased AFP (20.9 +/- 8.1 min) and the duration of absence of VEPs during the post-PHCA period. The duration of increased AFP correlated linearly and directly with the duration of absence of VEPs (r2 = 0.84, P less than 0.005). These data demonstrate that transient neurophysiologic dysfunction occurs after PHCA. This dysfunction is related to the duration of elevation of the AFP and cannot be explained solely by a temperature effect.\r"

Scintillation counters were placed over the middle cerebral artery territory ipsilateral to the operated carotid artery. CBF was measured by the intravenous method during dissection of the carotid sheath and was calculated as the initial slope index from head washout curves collected for 11 min after injection of 10-20 mCi 133Xe in saline into a large vein. Immediately prior to carotid occlusion, CBF was determined by direct injection of 1 mCi 133Xe in saline into either the internal carotid artery or the common carotid artery with the external carotid artery occluded. For the intracarotid injections, the initial slope was calculated from the 1st min of washout. Data were analyzed by linear regression and analysis of variance. Values are expressed as mean +/- SD. The mean CBF for intravenous and intracarotid methods were both 29 +/- 10 ml.100 g-1.min-1. The correlation between CBF measured by intravenous and intracarotid methods was excellent and was described by the line y = x + 0.6, r = 0.92. We conclude that in the flow range studied, the intravenous technique may be applied to measure CBF in physiologically stable situations in which direct intracarotid injection is not feasible.\r"

To determine their incidence, characteristics, and relation to postoperative cardiac morbidity, we continuously recorded the left ventricular short-axis view and 12-lead ECG in 156 high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Monitoring was clinically blinded. Wall motion was scored at predefined clinical, hemodynamic, and ECG events and at periodic intervals (26 +/- 11 samples per patient). We detected 44 episodes of new or worsened SWMA in 32 patients (20%). The severity of most episodes was limited to severe hypokinesis (24/44, 55%) followed by akinesis (16/44, 36%) and dyskinesis (4/44, 9%). The remaining 124 patients had normal wall motion or only mild hypokinesis (56/156, 36%) or chronic SWMA (68/156, 44%). The incidence of new SWMA did not differ for patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and those with cardiac risk factors only (22% vs. 19%, P = not significant), although CAD patients had a significantly greater incidence of chronic SWMA (62% vs. 41%, P = 0.02). The incidence of new or worsened SWMA was significantly greater during aortic vascular surgery (38% vs. 17%, P = 0.05). Approximately 40% of all new TEE changes occurred in the absence of either an apparent clinical event or a significant change in systolic blood pressure or heart rate. Ten patients had new or worsened SWMA persisting until the end of surgery, 8 with new akinesis, only 1 developing myocardial infarction. The distribution of new or worsened SWMA and significant intraoperative ST-T changes (n = 19) in this cohort was discordant: temporal overlap between modalities was present in only 5 patients. Major cardiac complications occurred in 5 patients (3.2%), all of whom underwent peripheral vascularization. All patients with cardiac complications and new or worsened SWMA also had intraoperative or early postoperative ST-T changes. We conclude that: 1) continuous TEE recording with offline analysis in this high-risk group of patients revealed a relatively low incidence of new or worsened SWMA (20%), most episodes of which were characterized by severe hypokinesis (55%); 2) episodes were more common in patients undergoing aortic vascular surgery; 3) approximately 40% of episodes were unaccompanied by clinical events or significant hemodynamic changes; 4) episodes were poorly correlated with postoperative cardiac complications; and 5) the discordant relation between TEE and ECG changes observed here necessitates careful monitoring of the ECG when TEE is used clinically.\r"

Thermoregulatory vasoconstriction was induced by central venous infusion of cooled fluid. Peripheral cutaneous blood flow was evaluated with venous-occlusion volume plethysmography and skin-surface temperature gradients. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure vasoconstriction in centrally located skin. This model mimics the common clinical situation in which patients in a warm environment are centrally cooled by administration of cold intravenous fluids or by lavage of internal cavities with cold fluids. Tympanic membrane temperature decreased 1.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C in the first 15 min after the cold fluid infusion was started and remained approximately 1 degrees C below control values during the rest of the study. Average skin-surface temperature decreased slowly to approximately 0.7 degrees C below control. Flow in capillaries of centrally distributed skin, determined with laser Doppler flowmetry, decreased only approximately 40%. Total heat flux, and flux from the arms and legs decreased approximately 25% (15.5 +/- 0.3 W). Heat loss from the trunk and head decreased only 17%, whereas, loss from the hands and feet (10.5% of the body surface area) decreased approximately 50%. All measured values decreased significantly following vasoconstriction (P less than 0.01). Therefore, thermoregulatory vasoconstriction in a thermoneutral environment appears to decrease cutaneous loss of metabolic heat approximately 25%.\r"

Analysis of arterial plasma samples obtained before, during, and 24 h after surgery showed that plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon, and beta endorphin increased in all patients (P less than 0.05). Insulin levels increased only at the end of surgery but remained elevated for 24 h postoperatively (P less than 0.02). Intraoperative metabolic changes were characterized by hyperglycemia and lactic acidemia that persisted postoperatively. This pattern of neonatal stress responses is distinct from and more extreme than that seen in adult cardiac surgical patients. The four neonates who died postoperatively tended to have higher stress responses intra- and postoperatively despite having been indistinguishable from survivors by the usual clinical and hemodynamic criteria. These preliminary results suggest that neonatal hormonal and metabolic responses to cardiac surgical operations in neonates are extreme and are associated with a high hospital mortality rate.\r"

The authors hypothesized that if a decrease in LV contractility indeed occurred due to a circulating depressant substance, then removal of this substance by hemofiltration would reverse by dysfunction. In this study, LV mechanics were examined before and after hemofiltration in anesthetized dogs during continuous intravenous infusion of live Escherichia coli. Left ventricular anterior-posterior and apex-base dimensions were measured by subendocardial ultrasonic crystal transducers implanted 4 weeks before the experiments. Left ventricular contractility was determined from the end-systolic pressure-dimension relationship. The slope of this relationship (Emax) is an index of contractility. After 4 h of sepsis, Emax was reduced by one half. Hemofiltration resulted in a return of Emax to control values. The FCS activity in the plasma was also assessed by the percent reduction in isometric contraction of electrically stimulated, isolated right ventricular trabeculae obtained from nonseptic dogs. The FCS activity reached a peak 4 h after sepsis and was reduced after 2 h of hemofiltration. The results show that during experimental sepsis, a circulating substance of less than 30,000 d produces a decrease in LV contractility and that this LV dysfunction may be improved by hemofiltration.\r"

Two groups of rats were given intravenous methohexital such that a stable EEG pattern of burst suppression was achieved. In one group of rats (n = 11), the lungs were mechanically ventilated with 70% N2O/30% O2, and in the other group (n = 10), ventilation was done with 70% nitrogen/30% O2. The middle cerebral artery was then occluded for 2 h, during which time mean arterial pressure, blood gases, hematocrit, plasma glucose, and head temperature were held constant between groups. The total doses of methohexital administered were similar in both groups as were the plasma methohexital concentrations immediately prior to onset of ischemia. After reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery, the animals were allowed to awaken. Neurologic evaluations were performed prior to ischemia and at 24 and 96 h postischemia. Cerebral infarct volume was measured at 96 h postischemia using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining and computer imaging techniques. There were no neurologic differences between the N2O and nitrogen groups at any experimental interval although both groups exhibited deficits at both 24 and 96 h postischemia relative to preischemic values. The two groups also had nearly identical cerebral infarct volumes (N2O = 231 +/- 97 mm3; nitrogen = 226 +/- 75 mm3; mean +/- SD).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether, and to what extent, release of endogenous vasopressin supports blood pressure when efferent sympathetic drive is blocked by epidural anesthesia, the authors studied the effects of high epidural anesthesia alone and when vasopressin was prevented from acting at its vascular (V1)-receptor in six awake, trained, unsedated dogs. On different days, the same dose of 0.5% bupivacaine (8-13 ml) was injected epidurally in a randomized fashion either in the presence or absence of (V1)-vasopressin receptor blockade, and the effects were evaluated on cardiovascular (arterial blood pressure, heart rate) and respiratory (blood gases, oxygen consumption) variables, and on plasma concentrations of vasopressin and renin. Results were also contrasted to those obtained after epidural injection of saline alone (placebo) in the same dogs. When endogenous vasopressin was prevented from acting by intravenous pretreatment with a specific V1-receptor antagonist (beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopenta-methylene-propionyl-O-Me-Tyr-Arg-Vasopressin), epidural anesthesia resulted in a rapid and sustained 35% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure from 92 mmHg +/- 5 SE to 60 mmHg +/- 4. In contrast, only a 14% decrease in mean blood pressure from 92 mmHg +/- 5 to 79 mm Hg +/- 6 was noted after epidural anesthesia alone. This difference between groups was statistically significant (P = 0.0001). The V1-receptor blockade alone had no detectable effect. Vasopressin plasma concentrations significantly increased from 3.4 +/- 0.3 pg.ml-1 to 16.2 +/- 3.2 pg.ml-1 after epidural anesthesia but did not change after epidural saline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that lower motor neuron injury, with its associated proliferation of acetylcholine receptors (AChR), induces resistance to the neuromuscular effects of d-tubocurarine (dTC) was tested in the rat. The left gastrocnemius was denervated by a 75-80% lesion of the sciatic nerve. The effective dose for 95% twitch depression (ED95) was studied in the denervated gastrocnemius and compared to the contralateral undenervated and sham-injured (control) gastrocnemius muscles approximately 2 weeks after injury. The AChR number was quantitated by the specific ligand 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin (125I-alpha-BT). Plasma dTC concentrations, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), were correlated to twitch tension during spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular blockade in the denervated animal. The ED95 (mean +/- SE) of dTC for the denervated leg was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher (0.26 +/- 0.06 mg.kg-1) than contralateral (0.16 +/- 0.03) and sham-operated left (0.13 +/- 0.03) legs. The twitch tension recovered to 50% of control twitch height at significantly (P less than 0.05) higher plasma dTC concentrations in the denervated (0.78 micrograms.ml-1) compared to contralateral (0.24 micrograms.ml-1) limb. The AChR number was significantly increased in the denervated limb (1041 +/- 96 fmol.mg protein-1) compared to contralateral right (109 +/- 4) and control left limb (113 +/- 11). There was a significant (P less than 0.05) positive correlation (R2 = 0.73) between ED95 and AChR number; that is, 73% of the variability in ED95 could be explained by changes in AChR. This study, therefore, confirms the hypothesis that proliferation of AChR after nerve denervation results in resistance to the neuromuscular effects of dTC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MAC was determined for each swine. Carotid artery and internal jugular catheters were inserted and each swine was allowed to recover for 48 h. After recovery, heart rate (HR), systemic systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and cardiac index (CI) were measured awake and then at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MAC of the designated anesthetic in random sequence. The (mean +/- SD) MAC for halothane was 0.90 +/- 0.12%; the MAC for isoflurane was 1.48 +/- 0.21%; and the MAC for sevoflurane was 2.12 +/- 0.39%. Awake (mean +/- SD) measurements of HR, SAP, and CI did not differ significantly among the three groups. Compared to the awake HR, the mean HR decreased 35% at 1.5 MAC halothane (P less than 0.001), 19% at 1.5 MAC isoflurane (P less than 0.005), and 31% at 1.5 MAC sevoflurane (P less than 0.005). Compared to awake SAP, mean SAP measurements decreased 46% at 1.5 MAC halothane (P less than 0.001), 43% at 1.5 MAC isoflurane (P less than 0.001), and 36% at 1.5 MAC sevoflurane (P less than 0.005). Mean SAP at 1.0 and 1.5 MAC halothane and isoflurane were significantly less than those measured at equipotent concentrations of sevoflurane (P less than 0.005).

NE and DOPEG were quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection; peptides were quantified by radioimmunoassay. The rate of overflow of NPY, NE, and DOPEG into superfusate was measured over time. The overflow of DOPEG into superfusate during basal conditions was 3.0 times that of NE. Efflux of DOPEG and NPY increased during ES; peak effluxes were not reached, however, until after cessation of stimulation. NE efflux peaked during ES. Effluxes of NE, NPY, and DOPEG were frequency-dependent at 12 and 6 Hz; at 1 Hz efflux of only NE was greater than basal. Halothane decreased significantly the rates of NPY and DOPEG efflux during and after 12 Hz ES; DOPEG efflux evoked by 6 Hz stimulation was also decreased by halothane. The percentage of the total tissue content of NPY that overflowed was decreased by halothane. Halothane did not affect the molar ratios of NE:DOPEG or NE:NPY during basal conditions or ES. These studies provide evidence that halothane slows efflux of NPY that is released along with NE from dog pulmonary artery during high frequencies of stimulation. Halothane also reduces the metabolism of NE to DOPEG.\r"

The time constant for isovolumic left ventricular pressure decline, T, was determined at each anesthetic concentration at the intrinsic heart rate and during atrial pacing to 150 beats per min. The effect of increased left ventricular afterload on T was investigated by partial occlusion of the thoracic aorta to raise the left ventricular systolic pressure to baseline in the presence of volatile anesthetics, and 20% above baseline in the absence of volatile anesthetics. Heart rate and left ventricular systolic pressure decreased substantially with all three anesthetics, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased (by 3-4 mmHg). Relaxation time constants increased with all three anesthetics at the intrinsic heart rate; when the heart rate was controlled by pacing, T increased in the halothane and enflurane, but not in the isoflurane, experiments. T was significantly prolonged (by 30-100%) by partial aortic occlusion in the presence of anesthetic, but not in the control measurements. T did not change significantly in the isoflurane experiments when atrial pacing was employed with partial aortic occlusion. The volatile anesthetics, particularly halothane, seem to impair the relaxation process of the left ventricle; further investigation of the mechanisms of this interference, such as anesthetic effects on intracellular calcium movement and total left ventricular load, is warranted.\r"

Experimentally, angioscopy was used to study the effects of the 5F \"Kensey\" catheter in \"normal\" porcine coronary arteries (NPCA) and postmortem human coronary arteries (PMHCA). In NPCA, the catheter keeps a coaxial position. Intimal flaps (IFs) were seen in 21/23 NPCAs. They occurred with all cam rotation speeds and were usually single and small (less than 25% of lumen). Perforations in patent arteries were rare (1/23). However, when the catheter was forced against the wall by passing through a narrowing of 5F diameter (made by a band ligature), perforations were more common at higher cam speeds. The epicardium remained intact in two thirds of perforations. Angioscopy visualized perforations in only 10% of cases (1/10), the common sign being that of large and multiple intimal flaps, which were often obstructive (5/10). In PMHCAs, angioscopy was more sensitive than angiography in detecting atheromatous lesions. The authors were able to give a better assessment of the effect of dynamic angioplasty on treated lesions, including the demonstration of intimal flaps that were not visible on angiography. In vivo, they have performed percutaneous angioscopy before and after dynamic angioplasty using 8 French Kensey catheters. Angioscopy revealed features that were not shown angiographically.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between intravascular hemolysis induced by aortic valve prosteses and patient status/left ventricular (LV) function (radionuclide cardiography) was examined in 63 patients of 65 who were alive ten to seventeen years after valve replacement (1965-1973) for aortic stenosis. Serum-lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) exceeded upper reference limit in 62 patients and S-haptoglobin (HAPTO) was reduced in 62. One patient with normal LDH had reduced HAPTO and elevated plasma-hemoglobin. Anemia was noted in 4 patients (6%). S-LDH was higher in men than in women (p less than 0.05), in patients with increased ECG hypertrophy score than in those with a normal score (p less than 0.05), in patients with NYHA class II-III than in those with class I (p less than 0.05), in patients with abnormal LV function than in those with a normal radionuclide study (p less than 0.05), in patients with a pathologic Q wave in the ECG than in those without (p less than 0.05), and in patients with a Starr Edwards cloth-covered (SECC) prosthesis than in those with other types (p = 0.07). ECG hypertrophy score correlated directly with LDH (r = 0.33, p = 0.008) and inversely with LV ejection fraction (r = -0.57, p less than 0.0001), peak ejection rate (r = -0.47, p less than 0.0001), and peak filling rate (r = -0.41, p less than 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that LDH was accounted for by ECG hypertrophy score (p = 0.001), SECC prosthesis (p = 0.04), and male gender (p = 0.05). Hypertrophic malfunctioning left ventricles may be responsible for higher degrees of turbulent flow characteristics in the vicinity of prosthetic valves in the aortic position and, by inference, explain the increased tendency toward hemolysis in these patients.\r"

Mean arterial blood pressure was lowered to 80 mmHg in SHRs and to 50 mmHg in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) by a controlled hemorrhage, and then the vertebral artery was bilaterally occluded through alar foramina of the first cervical vertebra. Following vertebral occlusion, blood flow of the cerebellum was significantly decreased to 9.4 +/- 2.0 mL/100g/min (+/- SEM) while flow of the cerebrum remained at 32.1 +/- 5.4 in SHRs. In contrast, cerebellar blood flow in WKYs was preserved at 24.2 +/- 2.9 mL/100g/min. Brain lactate, pyruvate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were determined in SHRs after sixty minutes of hypotension with or without vertebral occlusion. Although infratentorial metabolites were actually unaltered in rats with hypotension alone, infratentorial lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio significantly increased to 14.38 +/- 3.61 mmol/kg and 67.7 +/- 12.1, respectively, with a concomitant decrease in ATP in SHRs with hypotension and vertebral occlusion. Bilateral vertebral artery occlusion, together with moderate hypotension, was shown to produce a marked reduction of cerebellar blood flow and to induce ischemic metabolic changes in the infratentorial brain in SHRs.\r"

In the normotensive subjects cross-checkings were performed also during a treadmill exercise stress test. Analysis of variance did not indicate statistical differences between the two types of measurement (p greater than 0.09 for systolic and p greater than 0.62 for diastolic), and a significant linear correlation was found at rest (r = 0.99, p less than 0.001 for systolic and r = 0.98, p less than 0.001 for diastolic pressure). During the effort test the device was unable to correctly measure blood pressure values after the first step. During the twenty-four hour monitoring period only 1.1% of the preprogrammed measurements were lost for each subject. The recorder seems to be a suitable and reliable tool for automatic blood pressure monitoring.\r"

In order to evaluate efficacy and safety of high-dose furosemide (greater than 500 mg/day), the authors studied 20 patients (pts) resistant to therapy (including furosemide less than 500 mg/day) selected from 161 pts admitted for chronic heart failure. All refractory pts (15 men and 5 women, mean age sixty +/- 12 years) were in NYHA class IV and showed hyponatremia (130 +/- 5 mEq/L) and impaired renal function (BUN 31 +/- 14 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dL and BUN/creatinine ratio 23 +/- 7). In addition to digitalis, dopamine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or vasodilators, IV high-dose furosemide (775 +/- 419 mg/day, 500-2000) was given for ten +/- five days under daily clinical and laboratory monitoring. Three pts died of low-output syndrome while 16 pts were upgraded to NYHA class III and 1 pt to class II; a mean weight reduction of 7.3 +/- 2.9 kg in ten + five days (0.80 +/- 0.4 kg/day) and a mean diuresis increase of 88 +/- 57% occurred. The maximal dose of furosemide did not correlate with serum creatinine but did correlate with BUN/creatinine ratio (r = 0.78, p less than .001). Pts were discharged on with chronic heart failure, and 43% in the subgroup in NYHA class IV with hyponatremia. High dose furosemide was effective for rapid removal of excess water and salt in \"furosemide-resistant\" congestive heart failure. The relationship between renal impairment and maximal furosemide doses seems to confirm the role of renal pharmacokinetics in the appearance of furosemide resistance.\r"

After a one-minute walk the pressure index always decreased significantly, especially when walking was restricted. The decrease in the pressure index was generally greater when the exercise was continued until the absolute walking distance, and the recovery time was usually twice as long. The fall in the pressure index was significantly greater for patients with single and multiple iliac stenoses than for those with stenoses at lower levels. In patients having a diastolic blood flow velocity on Doppler curves at rest, not modified by walking, a maximum drop in peripheral pressure was recorded after walking for one minute. In this instance there was no intensification of the decrease in peripheral pressure, unlike in patients without a diastolic blood flow velocity at rest. This one-minute test is not a maximal hemodynamic response, but it is sufficient for the appreciation of ischemia during exercise, according to the different parameters measured.\r"

Clinical signs of initial DM were present in group I. All the examined pts were nonsmokers and normotensive and without cardiopathy, signs of diabetic macroangiopathy, collagen vascular disease and/or Raynaud's phenomenon, and renal failure. Four waveform dimensions capable of separating different degrees of peripheral obstructive arteriolar disease were determined on velocity tracing and the results used in a single best discriminant equation. The resultant discriminant score (DS), derived by FVWFA on DPA, showed a highly accurate rate of separating the young pts with DM from both C and the pts in menopause without DM. Furthermore, the resultant DS was statistically not different in groups II, III, and IV. In conclusion, FVWFA on DPA, in this experience, has proved to be an accurate and sensitive method in the detection of initial DM.\r"

For the study of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina pectoria, properly designed crossover studies are preferred to parallel studies. There is a considerable between-subject variability of symptoms in some of these conditions. Bias due to this is eliminated by the use of a crossover design. However, a problem is the so-called treatment-by-period interaction. The present study analyzes the potential influences of this on the outcome of the trial. Physical carryover effect, defined as a physical effect of the first treatment period carrying on into the second, tends to minimize differences between two consecutive treatment periods. So does the frustrating experience of an inactive agent in the first treatment period. Outside influences such as the change of the seasons may affect lengthy crossover trials in a similar way. The author concludes that the treatment effect in a crossover trial tends to be underestimated. The current concept that reports of clinical trials are generally biased toward an exaggeration of treatment effects does not seem to apply to crossover trials.\r"

  ".U": "91023586\r", 
  ".W": "Central hypovolemia occurring with epidural anesthesia was investigated by measurement of hemodynamic and endocrine variables in 10 patients. Responses fell into two categories. Four patients experienced a hypotensive bradycardic episode after seventeen +/- four minutes. In this group epidural anesthesia initially induced a tendency toward an increase in heart rate from 65 +/- 4 to 73 +/- 5 beats/min concomitantly with decreases in end-diastolic (172 +/- 22 to 138 +/- 16 mL), end-systolic (67 +/- 12 to 51 +/- 9 mL), and stroke (105 +/- 10 to 85 +/- 7 mL) volumes (radionuclide cardiography). A subsequent decrease in mean arterial pressure from 76 +/- 3 to 67 +/- 4 mmHg was associated with a decrease in venous return as reflected by the decrease in cardiac output from 6.1 +/- 0.4 to 4.7 +/- 0.7 L/min. In this situation when the venous return was critically reduced, the heart rate was 49 +/- 4 beats/min and no further reduction in end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes was observed. The observed endocrine changes were compatible with a response to central hypovolemia. In the other 6 patients the reaction to epidural anesthesia did not induce statistically significant changes in hemodynamic and endocrine variables. It is concluded (1) that the decrease in heart rate associated with central hypovolemia during epidural anesthesia seems to be elicited when the left ventricular end-systolic volume is decreased by about 25% and (2) that a further decrease in end-systolic volume during progressive central hypovolemia is avoided possibly as a direct consequence of the slowing of the heart.\r"

In dogs and in healthy volunteers it decreases blood pressure and heart rate but improves left ventricular function. The authors studied 10 male patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure (ejection fraction mean = 46%). A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed into the pulmonary artery, and the mean blood pressure, the heart rate, the pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary wedge pressure, the right atrial pressure, the cardiac output, and the stroke volume were measured at rest and on exertion before and after seven days' treatment with oral nebivolol (5 mg/day). While the blood pressure and the heart rate decreased significantly, the pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, as well as the right atrial pressure and the cardiac output, did not change during treatment. The stroke volume increased significantly. The maintained cardiac output cannot be explained by any changes in preload or afterload; instead a positive inotropic mechanism must be assumed. Unlike other B-blockers it seems to be possible to treat patients with heart failure with nebivolol without causing the hemodynamic situation to deteriorate.\r"

The dogs were divided into three groups: group I, sham bypass; group II, cold crystalloid cardioplegia; and group III, cold crystalloid cardioplegia with diltiazem. There was a decrease in aortic pressures left ventricular pressure development (dp/dt), left ventricular work index (LVWI), total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR), and left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) in the sham bypass group. There was a decrease in cardiac index (CI), LVWI, and mean right atrial pressure (mRAP) and an increase in TSVR and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in group II as compared with group I. Although there was a tendency for a decrease in the indices of myocardial contractility in group II, they were not significantly different from those in group I. The indices of myocardial contractility, CI, and LVWI in group III were slightly higher than in group II, but they were not significantly different from each other. The values for calcium uptake by SR in groups II and III were similar but significantly lower than those in group I. Calcium binding in group III was significantly lower than that in group I. Calcium ATPase of SR in the three groups were similar. Although MBCK increased in all the groups, the increases were not significantly different among the three groups. The results of this study indicate that cold crystalloid cardioplegia with diltiazem was not better than cold crystalloid alone in preserving the cardiac contractility and cellular function during prolonged ischemic cardiac arrest. However, the cardiac function in terms of cardiac index was better preserved with diltiazem.\r"

Transient vasoconstrictor responses of comparable degree could be evoked in all patient groups and in both the arterial and microvascular beds. While the addition of central cooling had little influence on arterial flow, patients with systemic sclerosis manifested a failure to maintain nutritive perfusion at finger temperatures associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. Linear regression and multivariate analysis suggested that finger temperature was the principal determinant of arterial flow in systemic sclerosis and that arterial flow was the principal determinant of microvascular perfusion. The inability of patients with systemic sclerosis to maintain nutritive flow in the face of either reflex or cold-induced proximal arterial constriction is consistent with their clinical propensity to ischemic tissue injury and separates these patients physiologically from other forms of Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

There was so significant difference between the groups in the mean time between the onset of infarction and revascularization (improved group, 259.3 +/- 76.9 min; unimproved group, 168.0 +/- 101.6 min) or in the sigma Q. which was the sum of the Q wave depth of V2, V3, and V4 at the time of admission (improved group, 12.1 +/- 15.6 mm; unimproved group 29.8 +/- 13.4 mm). The maximum creatine kinase concentration was significantly higher in the unimproved group (improved group 2670 +/- 893 IU/L; unimproved group, 7243 +/- 1928 IU/L, p less than 0.05), and the time taken from the onset to reach its peak was significantly shorter in the unimproved group (improved group, 13.0 +/- 5.1 hr; unimproved group, 6.8 +/- 1.3 hr, p less than 0.05.) These results suggest the probability of sudden deterioration of myocardium, and factors other than microcirculatory thromboembolism should be considered as the cause of unimproved cardiac function after successful direct PTCA.\r"

One patient suffered from thromboembolic episodes of the left hand, and the other had peripheral circulatory impairment related to collagen disease. In these patients, the oral administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in combination with intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E1 was not adequately effective. However, the addition of intravenous injection of FPFD 101 resulted in a marked improvement in their symptoms. FPFD 101, which has an anticoagulant effect and also inhibits platelet aggregation, seems to be useful for the treatment and prevention of chronic arterial occlusion when combined with drugs such as anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and vasodilators.\r"

The primary success rate, based on number of procedures (73.5% overall) was 69% in the first phase but reached 81.3% in the second phase. There were 14 perforations (16%), 8 dissections (9.4%), and 4 peripheral emboli (4.7%). Six-month follow-up shows that the Winsor index maintained its initial improvement in 76.5% of all patients, or 62% in just the long occlusions. These data and a review of the cases suggest that no more of 10-20% of patients with claudication in lower extremities can be treated by laser angioplasty; the authors consider ideal candidates those patients who noncalcific lesions in the common iliac or superficial femoral arteries at the III medium level with obstructions shorter than 8 cm and good runoff.\r"

The authors used a human-rabbit xenograft model to evaluate the thrombotic and healing responses of atherosclerotic vessels subjected to laser energy. Occluded atherosclerotic human coronary artery segments were recanalized in vitro by use of the THC:YAG laser. Destruction of plaque by the laser was achieved with minimal collateral thermal damage. These vascular segments were then transplanted into the rabbit abdominal aorta. The authors observed that the luminal surface of the lased vessels was more thrombogenic than that of the nonlased control vessels. However, occlusion of the lased vessels did not occur. Repair of laser-treated tissue progressed until a mature, nonthrombogenic fibrin-platelet aggregate was adherent to the luminal wall. Overall, the lased vessels behaved in a fashion similar to the nonlased control vessels. On the basis of these results, the authors believe that the THC:YAG laser may have use in human angioplasty.\r"

Mechanical endarterectomy can be useful, but it is not the optimal solution owing to the associated higher incidences of perioperative infarction and mortality. The use of laser energy as an endarterectomy tool appears promising. To investigate the application of excimer laser radiation to intraoperative coronary artery endarterectomy, 15 stenotic lesions in 13 patients were treated with excimer irradiation during coronary artery bypass grafting. Eleven (73%) of the lesions were enlarged by the excimer probe (6 of the successes were in calcified lesions). The 4 arteries not enlarged by the excimer laser all demonstrated calcified lesions. There were 3 perforations and 2 dissections, all but 1 in heavily calcified arteries. The results of this phase 1 safety and efficacy study indicate that excimer irradiation can recanalize most arteries, including total and subtotal occlusions and some calcified lesions. Further evaluation with better delivery systems is needed to determine whether the perforation rate can be reduced.\r"

This paper describes the authors' initial experience in-vitro and in-vivo with intravascular ultrasound as a possible method of enhancing the three-dimensional guidance of devices through atherosclerotic obstructions. Using an in-vitro model they correlated the dimensions and histologic morphology of animal and human arteries with ultrasound images of the specimens. Additional in-vivo evaluations of this technology in canine arteriosclerotic and human atherosclerotic arteries preliminarily support the hypothesis that intravascular ultrasound defines the transmural arterial morphology and may enhance the accuracy of angioplasty procedures. Simultaneous imaging with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound is demonstrated as a potential method of accurately defining both intraluminal and transmural arterial wall characteristics.\r"

In coronary artery bypass operations, multichannel angioscopes of 2.3 to 2.8 mm diameter gave the best results for examinations of the bypass vein and anastomosis, whereas smaller optical fibers of 1 mm diameter were required for inspection of the native coronary artery. Abnormalities were detected in 11 of 48 (23%) coronary bypass anastomoses, and significant discrepancy in the degree of coronary artery stenosis as compared with the preoperative angiogram was revealed in 2 patients. The authors concluded that a new design of ultrafine, multichannel angioscope would be more suitable to the different requirements for inspection of both the anastomosis and the recipient artery.\r"

Precodial ECG mapping and serial determination of blood enzyme activities (CPK and MB-CPK) showed that irradiation performed within the first hours of MI development contributed to effective limitation of the infarction area and restricted the spread of the area of myocardial ischemic damage.\r"

Ordinarily, such symptoms may be differentiated from those of classic allergic rhinitis, but allergists commonly see patients with a variety of upper airway complaints that on investigation prove not to have an allergic basis. Use of flexible fiberoptic upper airway endoscopy, a simple office procedure that permits direct inspection of the recessed areas of the upper airway, will result in timely evaluation and treatment of pathology of these upper airway lymphatic structures, and identification of patients requiring referral to another specialist.\r"

Thirty minutes later they exercised on a treadmill at a workload sufficient to induce greater than or equal to 80% aerobic O2 consumption for six minutes. Pulmonary function was measured before and serially for 30 minutes after exercise. The same exercise challenge was repeated three, six, and nine hours after drug administration. Both procaterol and albuterol bronchodilated and modified EIA at 30 minutes and three hours, mean drops in FEV1 being 8.2 and 9.7% respectively at 30 minutes and 16.8 and 16.3% at three hours.

Not only seven patients with asthmatic history but also five patients without asthma responded to both the in vitro and the in vivo challenges. A significant correlation was observed between HR30 (a mite concentration producing a 30% release of total cellular histamine) and PC20 allergen (a mite concentration producing a 20% fall in FEV1). There was also a significant correlation between MHR (maximal histamine release) and the maximal fall in FEV1. The relationship held for both AD patients with asthma and without asthma. These results suggest that histamine release induced by the house dust mite allergen is a good in vitro test for predicting the bronchial response to this allergen. They also suggest that these tests are not disease specific, but are valuable in evaluating the degree of atopic state in a subject.\r"

There was no significant change in methacholine PD20 FEV1 before and after exercise challenge, either in children who had early, or early and late, exercise responses. Late reactions after allergen exposure are likely to be of considerable clinical significance in relation to the enhancement of bronchial responsiveness. It is reassuring that this is not the case for exercise challenge, as it would have major implications in relation to the recommendations that asthmatics should participate in normal activities and even in training programs. Furthermore, it suggests that there are differences between the pathophysiology of asthma induced by exercise and that produced by allergens.\r"

We conclude that monoclonal antibody assays for Der p I and Der f I antigens can be performed in a well-equipped office laboratory staffed by trained medical technologists, that Der f I is the predominant mite species in Kansas, and that data derived from mite assays may be important in treatment planning for patients suspected of having mite-related allergy symptoms.\r"

A placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-way crossover study compared the safety and efficacy of Quazolast, 400 mg bid orally, with placebo in 23 subjects with ragweed (RW) allergy, out of season. Subjects were assigned to two 7-day treatments in a random sequence with an 8-day washout. Subjects were challenged on days 1 and 7 of each trial with serial dilutions (10, 100, 1000, 1350, and 2700 PNU/0.135 mL) of RW, using metered pump spray bottles, (two sprays delivered 0.135 mL), preceded by saline control. Efficacy evaluation consisted of nasal flow rates measured by rhinomanometry, sneeze counts, nasal itchiness scores, and weight of nasal secretions during challenges. During Quazolast treatment, subjects had significantly lower (P less than .05) mean percent decreases in nasal flow rate at 1350 and 2700 PNU. Nasal itchiness scores were significantly lower (P less than .05) during Quazolast treatment than at placebo at 1000, 1350, and 2700 PNU. Although sneeze counts were lower during treatment with Quazolast than with placebo, the results did not reach statistical significance. No significant improvement was seen in the weight of nasal secretions. Adverse experiences, clinical laboratory results, and physical examinations were unremarkable, posttreatment. Quazolast was superior to placebo in protecting against nasal congestion and nasal itchiness after ragweed nasal challenge.\r"

The baseline results were compared with those of nonexercising age-matched controls. In most subjects tested, running resulted in nanogram increases in C3a and C4a with corresponding decreases in the hemolytic activity of C4 (C4H). Baseline values of C3 and C4H were decreased significantly in runners when compared with nonexercising controls. Preliminary studies measuring the effect of exercise on C3a levels were also done in three asthmatic runners. Mean resting and postexercise levels, and exercise-induced increases in C3a anaphylatoxin in the asthmatic subjects were significantly higher than in the nonasthmatic subjects. The findings indicate that short-term exercise results in the activation of C3 and C4 and subsequent generation of C3a and C4a anaphylatoxins, and suggest that both activation of the classical pathway of complement and a selective downregulation of C3 production may occur in persons regularly engaged in aerobic exercise. The exaggerated generation of C3a by asthmatic subjects during exercise raises the possibility that anaphylatoxins play an etiologic role in exercise-induced asthma.\r"

Specific airway conductance (sGaw) was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) after each of the three maneuvers. All of the maneuvers caused the greatest bronchoconstriction immediately after completion of the maneuver. The mean decreases in the sGaw immediately after the FVC, DI, and PFV maneuvers were 45.0 +/- 6.6 (SD)% (P less than .001), 29.6 +/- 5.3% (P less than .001), and 16.7 +/- 5.3% (P less than .03), respectively. The decrease in sGaw by the FVC maneuver was very close to the combined algebraic sum of the DI maneuver and the PFV maneuver. The normal subjects did not show any changes in the sGaw by any of the maneuvers. The inhalation of albuterol almost abolished the response of bronchoconstriction to any of the three maneuvers, but inhalation of an anticholinergic agent, ipratropium bromide, did blunt the response. This study suggests that forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatics can be caused not only by deep inspiration to the TLC but also by forced expiration to the RV, and that the bronchoconstriction may be brought about mainly by an increase in parasympathetic activity.\r"

DESIGN: The trial was randomized and single blinded. SETTING: The study was conducted in two university-affiliated EDs. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients had an isolated diagnosis of common or classic migraine. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were pretreated with 500 mL (IV) normal saline before randomization. Study drugs as administered were dihydroergotamine 1 mg IV repeated after 30 minutes if the initial response was inadequate; lidocaine 50 mg IV at 20-minute intervals to a maximum total dose of 150 mg as required; or chloropromazine 12.5 mg IV repeated at 20-minute intervals to a total maximum dose of 37.5 mg as required. Patients were asked to grade headache severity on a ten-point scale before and one hour after the initiation of therapy. Follow-up by phone was sought the following day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 76 patients completing the trial, 24 were randomized to receive chloropromazine, 26 to receive dihydroergotamine, and 26 to receive lidocaine. Reduction in mean headache intensity was significantly better among those treated with chloropromazine (P less than .005). Persistent headache relief was experienced by 16 of the chloropromazine-treated patients (88.9%) contacted at 12 to 24 hours follow-up compared with ten of the dihydroergotamine-treated patients (52.6%) and five of the lidocaine-treated group (29.4%). CONCLUSION: The relative effectiveness of these three antimigraine therapies appears to favor chloropromazine in measures of headache relief, incidence of headache rebound, and patient satisfaction with therapy.\r"

SETTING: ED of an urban tertiary care center. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two individuals with a mean age of 28.5 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with positive CK-ISOs were admitted immediately to formally rule out myocardial infarction. Patients developing ECG changes during observation period also were admitted even if CK-ISOs were normal. Patients with unchanged ECGs and normal CK-ISOs were discharged after 12 hours of observation. RESULTS: Eight patients (19%) had elevated CK and CK-ISO values at presentation. Two of these patients had elevated values on three sequential determinations and were believed to have sustained acute myocardial infarction. Six patients had elevated CK and CK-ISOs at presentation only. ECGs remained normal or nondiagnostic in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enzymatic evidence of acute myocardial injury may occur in patients who develop chest pain after cocaine use and have normal or nondiagnostic ECGs. This injury may reflect acute infarction or transient ischemia. Single or serial normal or nondiagnostic ECGs do not rule out ischemia or injury in this group of patients.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive case series, N = 2,157. SETTING: ED of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, a publicly subsidized, 450-bed acute care hospital staffed by residents and faculty of the University of Tennessee, Memphis. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All ED patients with a positive urine pregnancy test treated between January 1 and December 31, 1988. INTERVENTIONS: Screening history, physical examination, and serum progesterone (P) and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) titer. MEASUREMENTS: All discharged patients were given follow-up appointments within two weeks; those found to have a P less than 25 ng/mL were called to return for repeat hCG and transvaginal ultrasound. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one of 2,157 patients (7.5%) with a positive urine pregnancy test were found to have an ectopic pregnancy. All but five had a P of less than 25 ng/mL (sensitivity, 97%); four of these were admitted for immediate surgery because of symptoms. Overall, the ED physician detected 89 of 161 ectopics (55.3%) on initial presentation, 53 (60%) of which were ruptured at the time of surgery. Seventy-two patients (44.7%) who were discharged but later found to have an ectopic pregnancy had benign clinical presentations, including 41 with vaginal bleeding. There were no statistically significant differences in the presenting symptoms of patients with unruptured ectopics compared with normal intrauterine pregnancies. All but one of the 72 discharged patients were noted the following day to have a progesterone of less than 25 ng/mL and contacted to return. Eight of these were found to have a ruptured ectopic at the time of surgery. Only 91 of 161 patients (56.5%) with ectopic pregnancy acknowledged one or more clinical risk factors on follow-up questioning. CONCLUSION: The standard history and physical examination, including those performed by gynecologic specialists, are insufficiently sensitive for early detection of unruptured ectopic pregnancy. EDs with a high incidence of ectopic pregnancy should strongly consider implementation of a universal progesterone screening program to decrease unnecessary patient morbidity and the risk of mortality from undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy.\r"

DESIGN: An in-vitro model using bronchial rings from New Zealand White rabbits stimulated to contract by electrical stimulation, histamine, or bethanechol. INTERVENTIONS: Magnesium chloride 1, 6, 16, 36, and 86 mM was added to each tissue bath and resting tension was measured. Electrical stimulation 100 V/100 ms, histamine 10 mM, or bethanechol 6.25 mM was added to washed tissues to induce contraction. This was followed with magnesium chloride 5, 10, and 50 mM, and the response of bronchial smooth muscle was measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Magnesium chloride 1, 6, 16, 36, and 86 mM decreased the mean +/- SEM resting tension of bronchial rings by 40 +/- 16, 100 +/- 11, 110 +/- 10, 170 +/- 9, and 275 +/- 22 mg, respectively. Electrical stimulation (4) of 100 V/100 ms increased the mean +/- SEM resting tension by 168 +/- 52 mg. Magnesium chloride 5, 15, and 50 mM added to the tissue bath decreased the response to 100 V/100 ms to 65 +/- 27, 40 +/- 23, and 1 +/- 0 mg, respectively. Histamine 10 mM (4) increased mean +/- SEM resting tension by 490 +/- 121 mg. Magnesium chloride 5, 15, and 50 mM decreased the histamine response by 80 +/- 56, 250 +/- 74, and 475 +/- 131 mg, respectively. Bethanechol 6.25 mM (14) increased the mean +/- SEM resting tension by 495 +/- 74 mg. Magnesium chloride (5, 15, 50 mM) decreased bethanechol-induced tension by 52 +/- 18, 184 +/- 26, and 506 +/- 64 mg, respectively. CONCLUSION: Magnesium chloride produced dose-dependent relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle at rest and when stimulated by histamine, bethanechol, or electrical impulse. Calcium chloride was unable to significantly reverse magnesium-induced relaxation. These data support the hypothesis that magnesium relaxes smooth muscle and dilates bronchial rings.\r"

PARTICIPANTS: Sprague-Dawley male adult rats were used in these studies. DESIGN: Animals were block-randomized to receive either an intraperitoneal distilled water injection equivalent to 5% or 15% of their body weight or no injection (controls). Rats were sacrificed 15 or 60 minutes after water injection or at an equivalent time for controls. INTERVENTIONS: No interventions were performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Water content of cerebral cortical gray and white matter was calculated from measurements of tissue specific gravity. Blood plasma osmolality and sodium and potassium concentrations were determined at various times after water injection. An index of blood-brain barrier permeability was obtained by measuring brain red blood cell and plasma volumes. A qualitative assessment of edema was made from light and electron micrographs of the cerebral cortex. We found that water injection produced a dose-dependent decrease in plasma osmolality and sodium concentration within 15 minutes. Cortical water content was unchanged after this period. An influx of water into cerebral gray, and, less readily, into cerebral white matter occurred during the next 15 minutes. Whole blood specific gravity and brain blood content were unchanged and thus did not confound the measurement of cerebral water content. Hematocrit was increased 60 minutes after a 15% water injection. The blood-brain barrier remained intact throughout this period. Microscopy revealed astrocytic swelling with slight extracellular fluid accumulation 60 minutes after the water injection. CONCLUSIONS: Homeostatic mechanisms in the cerebral cortex can maintain constant water content for at least 15 minutes during maintained intravascular hypo-osmolality. Fluid that subsequently moves into the tissue primarily enters an intracellular compartment. This model will be useful in investigating physiological mechanisms of brain water regulation and the pathogenesis of brain edema, a common clinical entity in emergency conditions.\r"

DESIGN: Controlled randomized trial with all animals undergoing left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and subsequent ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation. All animals were supported for four hours after resuscitation in an intensive care setting. INTERVENTION: Group 1 (eight) was resuscitated with standard external CPR and advanced life support. Group 2 (eight) was resuscitated with CPB. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Group hemodynamic, resuscitation variables, number resuscitated, and number of four-hour survivors were compared. Ischemic and necrotic myocardial weights were determined with histochemical staining techniques in four-hour survivors. Infarct size was measured as the ratio of necrotic weight to ischemic weight. Significantly fewer dogs were resuscitated in group 1 (four of eight) than in group 2 (eight of eight) (P less than .05). Group 2 survivors required significantly less epinephrine and lidocaine than group 1 survivors (P less than .05) and higher aortic diastolic and coronary perfusion pressures after CPB (P less than .001). The ratio of myocardial necrotic weight to ischemic weight at four hours was 0.82 +/- 0.25 in group 1 and 0.22 +/- 0.25 in group 2 (P less than .05). However, collateral blood flow was not measured in this study. CONCLUSION: This pilot study further substantiates the improvement in resuscitation rates obtainable with CPB. CPB may also limit infarct size during the postresuscitation period and requires further study.\r"

STUDY DESIGN: Two in-vitro studies were performed. In the first, serial ratios of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and activated charcoal (AC) powders were added to water and the solutions were analyzed for PEG concentration and osmolality. In the second, serial ratios of a pharmaceutical bowel irrigation solution and an AC preparation were combined with a constant amount of salicylic acid. Solution osmolalities, PEG, and salicylic acid concentrations were then quantified. RESULTS: Adsorption of PEG powder by AC was demonstrated; however, changes in solution osmolality were negligible. Thus, concurrent administration of these therapies appears safe. However, combining bowel irrigation solution with AC resulted in decreased salicylic acid adsorption. This was especially so with smaller amounts of AC that would pertain more to the smaller doses of AC used for multiple-dose charcoal therapy. CONCLUSION: If these in-vitro data are applicable to overdose patients, the administration of a routine initial charcoal dose to those who will be treated with whole-bowel irrigation would be appropriate. However, it is unlikely that the addition of multiple-dose charcoal therapy to whole-bowel irrigation would provide additional benefit for the patient.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: To test the accuracy of a newly developed meter that determines serum acetaminophen concentration after a 30-second analysis of one drop of whole blood. DESIGN: Sixty-six blood samples from patients with known or suspected drug overdose were analyzed for the presence of acetaminophen. In all cases determination of serum acetaminophen concentration was performed simultaneously with the meter and by a reference laboratory. SETTING: Eligible patients were those who presented during a nine-month period to the emergency departments of two tertiary care hospitals (including a pediatric hospital). RESULTS: Thirty-one specimens had a laboratory-confirmed detectable acetaminophen concentration. The meter identified these toxic specimens in all cases; there were no false-negatives (sensitivity, 100%). Among the 35 specimens not containing acetaminophen, the meter invariably confirmed a nondetectable serum acetaminophen concentration (specificity, 100%). Acetaminophen measurements by the meter correlated strongly with laboratory determinations (r = .985, P less than .001). Repeated testing of one specimen documented the precision and reproducibility of the meter's analysis; mean coefficient of variation was .08 in measuring toxic acetaminophen concentrations. Drug coingestion had no significant effect on the accuracy of the meter. Instrument accuracy was maintained after more than 100 uses without recalibration. CONCLUSIONS: This meter identifies the possibility of rapid and accurate determinations of serum acetaminophen concentration. The instrument is ideally suited for patients with acetaminophen poisoning in whom expeditious and appropriate administration of antidotal therapy is desired.\r"

This study sought to describe the spectrum of the syndrome and identify clinical features of patients at risk. DESIGN: Retrospective case series with analysis of common clinical features. SETTING: Medical emergency department of an urban teaching hospital serving an indigent population. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: ED patients with acute cocaine intoxication and a serum creatine kinase (all MM) of more than 500 U/L (8.3 ukat/L) who were admitted for in-hospital management. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients, representing 5% of cocaine-related patient visits, were identified over 20 months. Patients were divided into three groups: mild, characterized by anxiety, tachycardia, diaphoresis, dyspnea, or chest pain; moderate, characterized by delirium, agitation, fever, leukocytosis, or an elevated serum creatinine; and severe, characterized by seizure, coma, hypotension, arrhythmia, or cardiac arrest. There was a significant association between the rating system for level of intoxication and the severity of rhabdomyolysis and its complications (P less than .01). Patients at highest risk for complications of rhabdomyolysis were those in the moderate or severe groups. CONCLUSION: This classification system may be useful for the management of patients with acute cocaine intoxication, predicting those patients in whom aggressive therapy should be initiated in the ED to minimize the complications of rhabdomyolysis.\r"

During the first phase of the study, oral activated charcoal was administered to a total dose of 140 g over a ten-hour period. During the second phase of the study, phenytoin alone was administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Administration of activated charcoal resulted in a significant decrease in the area under the curve 0-inf (p = .008) and in total body clearance (P = .008). No difference in the effect on phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameters was noted when the charcoal was administered with or without sorbitol, but fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects were noted without sorbitol treatment. CONCLUSION: Oral activated charcoal was shown to affect phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameters. Further pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies are warranted to determine if activated charcoal results in a faster recovery from phenytoin toxicity.\r"

TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Any patient undergoing resuscitation for a nontraumatic cardiac arrest was eligible for the study. INTERVENTIONS: Resuscitation was carried out while flow velocities were monitored in various intracranial arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Vessel identification was based on the angle and depth of insonation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The internal carotid artery was located more consistently than either middle cerebral or ophthalmic arteries and provided superior waveforms for analysis. Alterations in flow velocity were noted and correlated to various therapeutic interventions. Flow velocities were 70% of normal during the early phase of resuscitation but deteriorated over time until there was no evidence of net forward flow. Even early in CPR, flow was demonstrated only during systole. CONCLUSION: Transcranial Doppler ultrasound appears to be a potentially promising means of determining cerebral flow in patients undergoing CPR.\r"

Of the 424 patients, 14 died (mortality rates: 8.1% of untreated and 0.4% of treated). Deaths were due to hypovolemic shock. Recommended treatment for asymptomatic patients who have chewed one or more raw beans is emergency department evaluation, gastric decontamination, administration of activated charcoal, observation until four to six hours after ingestion, and discharge instructions to return if symptoms develop. After decontamination and activated charcoal, symptomatic patients require hospitalization for treatment with IV fluids, supportive care, and monitoring for hypoglycemia, hemolysis, and complications of hypovolemia. Monitoring for delayed cytotoxicity is unnecessary. Castor beans and their dust are highly allergenic and may cause anaphylaxis.\r"

Organic solvent extracts of natural surfactant and Survanta significantly improved dynamic compliances and lung volumes compared with those in control rabbits, but the effects were less than for natural surfactant. Adding 1 to 10% by weight SP-A to organic solvent extracts of natural surfactant increased dynamic compliances and maximal lung volumes on pressure-volume curves to values comparable with natural surfactant. Lung volumes at 10 cm H2O on deflation curves increased in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations of SP-A between 0.5 and 5% by weight with no further improvement at 10% SP-A, although the volumes were significantly lower than for natural surfactant. Five percent by weight SP-A did not improve any measurements for Survanta. These results indicated that SP-A favorably improved organic solvent extracted natural surfactant function in vivo. However, the responses could not be generalized to another surfactant.\r"

  ".W": "Healthy, nonsmoking human volunteers were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of NO2 followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to study whether NO2 exposure decreases the functional activity of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) in the lung. Two 3-h exposure protocols with intermittent exercise were employed and BAL was performed 3.5 h after exposure. The first exposure protocol with nine subjects involved three 2-ppm \"peaks\" with a 0.05 ppm background, whereas the second protocol with 15 subjects was a continuous exposure to 1.5 ppm NO2. All subjects were randomly exposed to either air or NO2, with at least a 2-wk interval between treatments, and the BAL fluids obtained after air exposure served as the controls. The BAL fluids were analyzed for alpha 1-PI elastase inhibitory activity, the immunologic concentration of alpha 1-PI, total protein, and albumin. The ratio of alpha 1-PI activity to its immunologic concentration was taken as the functional activity of alpha 1-PI, and possible changes in the amount of alpha 1-PI in the lung were assessed by examining the ratio of the immunologic concentration of alpha 1-PI to total protein. Neither of the NO2 exposure protocols resulted in a decrease in the functional activity of alpha 1-PI, nor were there alterations in the immunologic levels of alpha 1-PI. These data suggest that short-term exposures to low levels of NO2 do not result in a lung-localized deficiency of active alpha 1-PI, which has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of emphysema.\r"

  ".U": "91023715\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of the complement system with generation of the potent neutrophil chemotactic factor C5a has been proposed to play a significant role in the neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of cigarette smokers. Chemotactic factor inactivator (CFI) can inhibit C5a-directed neutrophil chemotaxis by binding to the C5a cochemotaxin GcGlobulin (GcG), a vitamin-D-binding protein, and inhibiting the capacity of GcG to enhance the chemotactic activity of C5a. Because cigarette smoke can inhibit the function of some proteins, a loss of CFI functional activity induced by cigarette smoke would allow an increased capacity of GcG to augment C5a-directed neutrophil chemotaxis. In order to test this hypothesis, cigarette smoke was bubbled through a CFI solution, and the solution was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the chemotactic activity of C5a and GcG. Smoke-treated CFI inhibited only 36% of the C5a-GcG chemotactic activity. In contrast, a CFI solution treated with air inhibited 62% of the chemotactic activity (p less than 0.001). Consistent with these observations, smoke-treated CFI exhibited a decreased capacity to bind to GcG and a decreased capacity to inhibit the binding of C5a des Arg to GcG. CFI contained in the bronchial lavage fluids obtained from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease secondary to cigarette smoking and asymptomatic smokers exhibited a decreased capacity to inhibit C5a-GcG neutrophil chemotaxis and to bind to GcG (p less than 0.05, both comparisons). Furthermore, smoke bubbled through normal bronchial lavage fluid decreased the capacity of CFI to bind to GcG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It appears that lymph node metastases are more frequent in lung cancer than in other cancers because of impaired defensive mechanisms in the regional lymph nodes. However, little is known about the immunologic function of regional lymph node lymphocytes (RLNL) in patients with lung cancer. We have studied the immunologic properties of RLNL in comparison with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). We measured the natural killer (NK) cell activity of RLNL and PBL in patients with lung cancer and found that the NK activity was significantly more depressed in the RLNL than in the PBL. In contrast, interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was markedly higher in the RLNL than in the PBL. The cytotoxic effect of RLNL in nonmetastatic lymph nodes on target cells (such as K562 cells) or PC-3 and PC-10 cells (NK-resistant, human lung cancer of adenocarcinoma and epidermoid carcinoma, respectively) was significantly enhanced by in vitro incubation with recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2). Furthermore, we clarified that both rIL-2 and OK-432, which is a biologic response modifier and IL-2 inducer as well, augmented the cytotoxicity of RLNL and that these effector cells were lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. The depletion of lymphocyte subsets by pretreatment with specific monoclonal antibody showed that the LAK activity in RLNL was mediated by CD3+ and CD8+ cells, whereas the lymphocyte subsets contributing the LAK activity in PBL were CD3+ and CD16+ cells. It was concluded that a majority of the effector cells in RLNL were LAK cells of the cytotoxic T cell population.\r"

We used well-described methods in the awake sheep-endotoxin model to evaluate the effectiveness of a commercially manufactured antibody to prevent the physiologic changes of endotoxemia. In awake sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulas, we used a whole-body plethysmograph to measure Cdyn, RL, and FRC. Pulmonary artery, left atrial, and systemic arterial pressures were recorded continuously. Arterial blood gases (for calculating AaPO2), leukocyte counts, and lymph samples were collected every 30 min. Animals received a 30-min (2 mg/kg) infusion of antiendotoxin antibody 4 h before LPS (0.75 micrograms/kg) challenge (n = 4), or were given a mixture of LPS (0.75 micrograms/kg) and antibody (2 mg/kg) that had been incubated in vitro at 37 degrees C for 30 min before infusion (n = 6). A control group given only 2 mg/kg of antibody (n = 4) showed no change in any measured parameter, whereas control animals receiving LPS alone (n = 6) exhibited a typical endotoxin response. In all animals receiving endotoxin, Cdyn declined by approximately 50% within 30 to 60 min, and RL increased approximately sixfold over a similar time course. Accompanying the abnormalities in lung mechanics were pulmonary hypertension, leukopenia, and widening of the AaPO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized that thrombin activation may play a prominent role in endotoxin-induced secondary organ failure, such as acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, we administered a thrombin-specific inhibitor, recombinant hirudin, in endotoxemic pigs. The pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and prepared with Swan-Ganz and extravascular lung water (EVLW) catheters. A total of 18 randomly selected animals received a pretreatment of 1,000 U/kg of hirudin, followed by a continuous infusion over 6 h of 500 U/kg/h given simultaneously with the infusion of 10 micrograms/kg/h of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin. Another 18 animals received a continuous infusion over 6 h of endotoxin but did not receive hirudin. All animals were fluid resuscitated with 17 ml/kg/h of saline for the duration of the experiment. Data are expressed as the mean (95% confidence interval). Hirudin reduced the endotoxin-induced consumption of plasma fibrinogen from -110 (-138 to -82) mg/100 ml to -39 (-67 to -12) mg/100 ml (p = 0.0001) and endotoxin-induced increases in the soluble fibrin in plasma from 434 (369 to 499) ng/ml to 236 (171 to 300) ng/ml (p = 0.0002). These data suggest an effective inhibition of the endotoxin-generated thrombin by hirudin. Furthermore, hirudin significantly reduced endotoxin-induced increases in pulmonary vascular resistance from 32 (27 to 37) kdyn x s x cm-5 x kg to 20 (15 to 25) kdyn x s x cm-5 x kg (p = 0.0015) and increases in EVLW from 15.4 (13.2 to 17.6) ml/kg to 12.2 (10.0 to 14.4) ml/kg (p = 0.0299).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To verify the abnormal pulmonary vascular response implicated in the pathogenesis of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), we examined the hemodynamic responses to hypoxia in HAPE-susceptible subjects (HAPE-S) by means of both right heart catheterization and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The HAPE-S were seven men and one woman with a history of HAPE. Six healthy volunteers who had repeated experiences of mountain climbing without any history of altitude-related problems served as control subjects. The HAPE-S showed much greater increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than did the control subjects, resulting in a much higher level of pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) under acute hypoxia both of 15% O2 and 10% O2. We then evaluated the usefulness of pulsed Doppler echocardiography in the prediction of pulmonary hypertension. Acceleration time (AcT) and right ventricular ejection time (RVET) were measured from the flow velocity pattern in the right ventricular outflow tract. The ratio of AcT to RVET was correlated to invasively determined mean Ppa (Ppa) and PVR. The results were as follows: (1) AcT/RVET = 0.52 to 0.0047 (Ppa), r = -0.93, SEE = 0.017, p less than 0.001 (HAPE-S); (2) AcT/RVET = 0.55 to 0.0055 (Ppa), r = -0.70, SEE = 0.030, p less than 0.001 (HAPE-S); (4) AcT/RVET = 0.52 to 0.00077 (PVR), r = -0.91, SEE = 0.016, p less than 0.001 (control subjects). We conclude that HAPE-S have a constitutional abnormality in the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia, which is a possible causative factor of HAPE, and that pulsed Doppler echocardiography may be supportive to assess the pulmonary vascular pressor response in the HAPE-S.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of molecular diffusion on gas-mixing during conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) and high frequency ventilation (HFV) was studied by observing the wash-in of six poorly soluble, inert gases in arterial blood. Anesthetized dogs were ventilated either with CMV or HFV. Following a step change in inspired gas composition, the increase in arterial concentrations of hydrogen, helium, methane, ethane, isobutane, and sulfur hexafluoride was determined by gas chromatography. The relative gas diffusivities encompassed a range of almost one order of magnitude. Propane, present in inspired gas during both the control and wash-in phases, served as an internal reference for calculation of blood tracer concentrations. The wash-in of all six inert gases followed a single exponential time course during both CMV and HFV. The rate of wash-in of each gas decreased with increasing molecular weight (MW). The relationship of rate constants to a measure of relative diffusivity (MW-0.5) was significantly different than zero for both types of ventilation. The slope of this relationship was three times larger for CMV than HFV, indicating that molecular diffusion has a greater role in gas mixing during ventilation with large tidal volumes. Diffusion has a minor role in gas mixing during high frequency ventilation with small tidal volumes. Demonstration of the presence of gas separation secondary to molecular diffusion during HFV is enhanced by measuring wash-in, rather than wash-out, of inert gases because gas separation is likely to be obscured as exhaled gases pass through the well-mixed central airways during gas wash-out.\r"

We studied six male asymptomatic asthmatics 18 to 35 yr of age. In a preliminary study we determined the concentration of MCh causing a 60% fall in FEV1 (PC60 FEV1). On two subsequent days, we measured breathing pattern, dyspnea sensation (Borg scale), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), and FEV1 before and 10 min after an intravenous injection of either naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) or saline according to a randomized double-blind crossover design. A MCh concentration equal to the PC60 FEV1 was then inhaled, and measurements were repeated 5 min later. Neither placebo nor naloxone affected baseline breathing pattern, P0.1, and FEV1. Naloxone pretreatment did not influence airway response to MCh; the mean percent fall in FEV1 was 65.9 +/- 1.3 and 64.7 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- 1 SE) on the placebo day and the naloxone day, respectively. After MCh inhalation no significant changes in VE, VT, and breathing frequency occurred when patients received placebo. However, P0.1 increased from 1.48 +/- 0.17 to 3.43 +/- 0.70 cm H2O (p less than 0.05), and VT/TI fell from 0.66 +/- 0.08 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 L/s (p less than 0.05). Naloxone pretreatment resulted in an increase in breathing frequency (from 18.2 +/- 1.7 to 22.8 +/- 2.6 breaths/min; p less than 0.05) and VT/TI (from 0.58 +/- 0.06 to 0.74 +/- 0.05 L/s; p less than 0.05) after MCh.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several studies have implicated products of cyclooxygenase metabolism in the mediation of these changes. The purpose of this study was to determine if indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) would alter the changes in the ozone-induced increase in responsiveness to methacholine or the ozone-induced decrease in lung function. Thirteen male subjects underwent three randomly assigned 2-h exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone with alternating 15-min periods of rest and exercise on a cycle ergometer (30 L/min/m2, body surface area). For the 4 days before each of the exposures, the subjects received either indomethacin (150 mg/day) or placebo, or no modification. Of the 13 subjects, only seven had both detectable indomethacin serum levels on the indomethacin Study Day and a significant increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine on the No Medication Day. For this group of seven subjects, we found that indomethacin did not alter the ozone-induced increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (decrease in PC100SRaw for the different study days: no medication, -78.4 +/- 5.3% [mean +/- SEM]; placebo, -48.9 +/- 12.2%; indomethacin, -64.5 +/- 6.3%; p greater than 0.2), although indomethacin did attenuate the ozone-induced decrease in lung function. The decrease in the FEV1 for the different study days was as follows: no medication, -20.7 +/- 5.0% (mean +/- SEM); placebo, -19.2 +/- 6.3%; indomethacin, -4.8 +/- 3.7% (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen asthmatic patients with a biphasic asthmatic reaction to house dust mite were studied. The effect of deep inhalation (DI) was quantitated by comparing the maximal expiratory flow at 40% (MEF40) of vital capacity from partial (P) and maximal (M) flow-volume curves, and specific airway conductance (SGaw) before and after DI (SGawDI). At baseline, the ratio MEF40M/P was significantly larger than unity (1.45 +/- 0.26 SD), whereas the ratio SGawDI/SGaw was not significantly different from unity (0.92 +/- 0.24). During early phase reaction, both MEF40M/P and SGawDI/SGaw were significantly increased to 2.66 +/- 0.97 and 1.96 +/- 0.47, respectively. During late phase reaction, when the FEV1 values were similar to those observed during early phase reaction, MEF40M/P and SGawDI/SGaw were 1.86 +/- 0.46 and 1.43 +/- 0.29, respectively, significantly higher than the values at baseline but significantly lower than those during early phase reaction. Similar results were obtained in a subgroup of nine patients when SGaw values during the late phase reaction were similar to those during the early phase reaction. We conclude that DI has a different effect during early and late asthmatic reactions, suggesting a different ratio of airway to parenchymal hysteresis. This may result from an increased parenchymal hysteresis (more peripherally located bronchial obstruction) or a decreased airway hysteresis (prominent airway inflammation) during the late phase reaction.\r"

From these data, global and regional thermal energy exchanges were calculated. Inspired air conditions, work loads, and minute ventilations were held constant for both trials. Pulmonary mechanics were measured prior to and serially after each challenge. As expected, the second provocation produced a smaller response than did the first. In association with these mechanical changes, the second challenge also produced less airway cooling and slower rewarming in the central airways. Hence, repetitive exercise trials performed over short intervals attenuate the essential thermal gradients necessary to produce obstruction. To the extent that these differences in intra-airway temperature reflect changes in perfusion, our data raise the possibility that the responsivity of the bronchial microcirculation of asthmatics may be altered by repetitive exercise.\r"

To evaluate whether prolonged treatment can bring about full recovery, this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial examined the effect of budesonide, 400 micrograms daily for 1 yr, on airway hyperresponsiveness. The time course and characteristics of improvements and associated changes in clinical asthma severity were also evaluated. Thirty-two stable adult asthmatics, requiring bronchodilators alone, were selected. Before and monthly throughout the study, airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured and clinical asthma severity assessed by questionnaire, daily bronchodilator use, and number of asthma exacerbations. Patients receiving budesonide showed a fourfold mean improvement in airway responsiveness compared with those receiving placebo (p less than 0.0005), whose responsiveness remained very stable. Fifteen of the 16 budesonide subjects improved and 5 returned to the normal range. Largest improvements occurred during the first 3 months but, in some, were still progressing slowly at 1 yr. Improvements in responsiveness were accompanied by significant improvements in asthma symptoms, bronchodilator use, and number of asthma exacerbations. The results show that regular, prolonged use of inhaled steroid can produce marked improvements in airway hyperresponsiveness, sometimes with full resolution, and these improvements are accompanied by clinically significant improvements in clinical asthma.\r"

The question as to whether these are associated with respiratory impairment independently of parenchymal disease remains unresolved. The question was reinvestigated using quantitative gallium-67 lung scanning to take into account early parenchymal change not evident on the chest radiograph. We carried out a cross-sectional study of 110 construction insulators all currently at work. Overall, 58.2% had pleural abnormality, 52.5% pleural plaques only, and 5.5% diffuse pleural thickening as assessed from the PA chest radiograph. Compared with those without, those with any pleural abnormality had a decrease in FEV1 and FVC on average of 222 and 402 ml (p less than 0.05), and those with isolated pleural plaques, a decrease on average of 200 and 350 ml (p less than 0.05), after taking into account age, height, smoking status, and the presence of parenchymal abnormality as assessed by chest radiography and gallium uptake. The complaint of dyspnea with strenuous activities was also significantly related to the width and extent of chest wall pleural thickening (p less than 0.05), independently of parenchymal disease. This study suggests that the most common radiographic findings in asbestos-exposed, isolated pleural plaques are associated with a significant reduction in FEV1 and FVC, which cannot be attributed to the presence of radiographic and subradiographic pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

Quantitation of ferruginous bodies and uncoated fibers was done by light and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Differences in the asbestos burden were noted for each site. Ferruginous bodies were observed in both parenchyma and nodes but not in plaques. Three subjects were found to have more ferruginous bodies per gram dry weight in their lymph nodes than in their lung parenchyma. Likewise, all subjects were found to have more uncoated fibers per gram in the nodes than in the parenchyma. Amphibole and chrysotile fibers were noted in the lung and extrapulmonary sites, with chrysotile being the predominant asbestiform in plaques. The majority of the uncoated fibers in both the nodes and the plaques were less than or equal to 5 microns in length. However, some fibers with dimensions conforming to the \"Stanton hypothesis\" reached both areas. These residual patterns most likely reflect the impact of clearance on lung burden as opposed to the eventual accumulation and stasis in the extrapulmonary areas.\r"

Over a period of 2 wk prior to bronchoscopy, patients recorded asthma symptom scores, bronchodilator usage, and twice-daily peak expiratory flow. Five days before bronchoscopy, methacholine responsiveness was assessed. Two biopsies were taken from the subcarinae, one of which was processed into araldite for immunostaining by the streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method and the other into Spurr resin for electron microscopy. The number of AA1 staining mast cells present in the bronchial mucosa was not significantly different in the epithelium or submucosa between the asthmatic and the normal subjects. However, in the biopsies from asthmatics, there were significantly greater numbers of EG2-staining eosinophils in the epithelium (median, 1.2/mm versus zero; p less than 0.005) and in the submucosa (median, 50/mm2 versus 1/mm2; p less than 0.001). Electron microscopy showed morphologic features of mast cell and eosinophil degranulation in the asthmatics. No correlation could be established between mast cell or eosinophil numbers and indices of disease activity of PC20 methacholine, which points to the complexity of mechanisms responsible for the symptoms and the airway hyperresponsiveness of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "In paired experiments, we studied the effects of high-dose methylprednisolone on the acute pulmonary injury caused by 4 h of venous air embolization in 19 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas. We compared the effect of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg intravenous bolus) given before embolization, early (1 H) in the course of embolization, late (3 h) in the course of embolization, or after embolization (at the beginning of the recovery period). We measured pulmonary hemodynamics and lymph dynamics. In six sheep we also fixed lung tissue for semiquantitative histology, and in some we measured leukocyte concentrations in blood and in pulmonary lymph. Methylprednisolone did not significantly affect pulmonary hemodynamics but it largely prevented lung injury when it was given before embolization. It also lessened the degree of lung injury when it was given during embolization, although this effect became less marked as treatment was delayed. Methylprednisolone had no effect on lung injury when given after embolization was completed (4 h). We found fewer leukocytes attached to air emboli and fewer endothelial cell gaps in the lungs of sheep given methylprednisolone as prophylaxis. Leukocyte counts were lower in lung lymph and higher in the circulating blood of methylprednisolone-treated sheep. We conclude that methylprednisolone has a preventive effect on air embolism lung injury, such that its effect is greater when given earlier during the development of injury.\r"

At bronchoscopy, the lesion appeared deeply ulcerated, distinctly different from previously described airway lesions in patients with AIDS. Mucosal biopsies showed characteristic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions and cultures yielded only CMV. The patient responded partially to ganciclovir, steroids, and antibiotics against suspected anaerobic superinfection but died as a result of central nervous system disease believed due to toxoplasmosis or lymphoma. CMV infection of the upper airway should be considered in the patient with AIDS presenting with atypical cough or stridor and ulcerated endobronchial lesions.\r"

These data were clinically useful for distinguishing the CD8+ alveolitis associated with HIV infection from the CD4+ alveolitis associated with sarcoidosis. Three patients improved with corticosteroid therapy. Two patients with BAL-documented CD8+ alveolitis tolerated discontinuation of steroids. One patient's sarcoidosis improved without therapy concurrent with the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. Another patient developed sarcoidosis 1 yr after manifesting HIV positive serology. BAL can be used to distinguish the lymphocytic alveolitis of sarcoidosis from that associated with HIV infection. Patients with active sarcoidosis complicated by HIV infection can be effectively treated with corticosteroid therapy.\r"

To determine whether abnormal ciliary motility is a predisposing factor, in vitro ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured in two patients with YNS and recurrent respiratory infections. In each case, the CBF was within normal limits (12 Hz). These data suggest that abnormal ciliary motility is not a pathophysiologic mechanism of recurrent sinopulmonary infections in YNS.\r"

A total of 51 cultures were simultaneously obtained of patient's sputum, the exterior MVB surface, MVB port, and MVB interior (postexhalation valve). Pathogens colonizing or infecting the respiratory tract of intubated ICU patients were frequently simultaneously present on the exterior surface of the MVB and inside the MVB port used to connect the MVB with the endotracheal tube. In addition, coagulase-negative staphylococci and yeast were frequently present on the exterior surface of the MVB. The interior of the MVB was usually sterile. In three instances pathogens were isolated from the MVB before isolation from the patient's sputum. MVB may serve as a source for colonizing the respiratory tract of intubated ICU patients and/or the hands of medical personnel. The exterior surface and port of MVB should be cleaned of visible debris and disinfected at least once a day.\r"

  ".U": "91023740\r", 
  ".W": "In summary, these findings indicate the importance of designing future experiments that delineate between opioid and nonopioid forms of respiratory disease and dysfunction, and the need to identify means of diagnosing them in order to achieve successful recovery. Apparently there is great diversity between animal species in terms of contributions of endogenous opioids to tonic control of ventilation, and future work should strive to identify which species is most appropriate as a model of human ventilatory control and disease. Certain opioid receptor types appear to be linked to independent respiratory functions. For instance, mu receptors in the brain stem produce strong inhibitory actions on respiratory parameters, including RR, VT, VE, and CO2 sensitivity. These effects have been observed in vivo and by electrophysiologic recordings in vitro. Delta receptors may also exert some inhibitory effect on respiration, especially in the NTS. In the CNS, the ventral surfaces of the medulla and pons, especially the NTS and NA, seem to be important sites for opioid-induced inhibition of respiration, whereas the spinal cord probably is not involved in opioid-mediated ventilatory depression. Kappa receptors appear to be devoid of respiratory depressant activity, whereas sigma receptors may stimulate some ventilatory parameters. Morphine and similar pure mu agonists, such as fentanyl and oxymorphine, probably produce their analgesic and respiratory depressant effects through stimulation of mu receptors. Mixed agonists/antagonists that have mu antagonist (or partial agonist) activity plus kappa agonist and/or sigma agonist activity show a ceiling effect for respiratory depression. Future tests need to determine which opioid receptor may be responsible for the ceiling effect. In addition, the effects of mu, delta, kappa, and sigma selective agonists on hypoxic drive should also be determined, as a drug that stimulates hypoxic sensitivity in the face of hypercapnic depression may produce less overall respiratory depression due to counteractive effects. In the future, clinically optimal opiates should have more specificity of action than those available now. This may be achieved by creating drugs selective for single receptors or by creating drugs with desirable combinations of receptor selectivities. The combinations of mixed agonists/antagonists with pure mu agonists currently in use today are promising, as they provide analgesia with reduced respiratory depression. In the early days of opiate research and development, combination drug regimens were thoroughly tested to determine the \"ideal ratios\" that would retain analgesic properties but not the other undesirable effects such as respiratory depression (196).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In 1985, the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble (GEGB) was offered as an adjunct to dietary and behavioral therapy for weight loss treatment. The safety and efficacy of the GEGB were compared with bariatric surgery, the current standard for the treatment of morbid obesity. Fifty-seven patients received GEGB and 77 underwent bariatric surgery. GEGB patients were divided into two groups: those who attended group therapy and those who did not. This study showed that bariatric surgery was far more effective in reducing excess body weight during a 12-month period compared with the GEGB plus group therapy and the GEGB alone. The morbidity from bariatric surgery was greater than in the GEGB-treated groups, while the cost for uncomplicated cases for a year's treatment was comparable. It is concluded that the GEGB does not offer an effective alternative to bariatric surgery in the treatment of morbid obesity.\r"

We describe two cases of peritonitis requiring laparotomy in anticoagulated patients, and review 49 similar case reports from the world literature. These patients were usually explored for signs of bowel obstruction. At operation, the intestine often appeared infarcted, but pathologic examination commonly revealed intramural hematomata. In contrast, we present microscopic evidence of hemorrhagic cecal infarction complicating oral anticoagulation therapy in one patient. Intramural intestinal hemorrhage is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain in the anticoagulated patient who undergoes laparotomy. In addition to intramural hemorrhage, 14 per cent of patients had coexistent volvulus, appendicitis, intestinal wall disruption or intestinal infarction. We conclude that anticoagulated patients with suspected intramural intestinal hemorrhage may have severe intraabdominal pathology requiring operation. Therefore, operation is mandatory for patients who fail to improve after a short course of expectant management.\r"

We reviewed the records of 77 patients with mechanical small-bowel obstruction who were treated with endoscopically and fluoroscopically placed Leonard long intestinal tube decompression. Most patients (59%) had failed a trial of nasogastric tube or Miller-Abbott tube decompression. Overall, 29 per cent of patients were able to resolve their obstruction with Leonard tube decompression alone. Subdivision of patients on the basis of the etiology of their obstruction demonstrated a much higher rate of success for tube decompression in adhesive obstruction (37%) versus malignant obstruction (12%) or inflammatory obstruction (no successes). Patients with radiographic and clinical evidence of complete intestinal obstruction were significantly less likely to respond to long intestinal tube treatment (13%). The long intestinal tube was easily passed in all patients. There were no complications of the intubation procedure in our series, and the incidence of tube-related complications was four per cent. We conclude that an initial period of long intestinal tube decompression allows a significant percentage of patients with mechanical small-bowel obstruction to be treated nonoperatively, particularly if a partial obstruction from postoperative adhesions is present. Patients who have failed a trial of nasogastric tube decompression and are poor operative risks should also be considered for long intestinal tube placement.\r"

Gastric mucosal blood flow was determined at ten defined sites of the stomach, before the first session of sclerotherapy and after complete variceal eradication had been achieved in 15 patients. A statistically significant decrease (P less than 0.01 to 0.05) in microcirculation was found at the gastric antrum and corpus, an increase at the pylorus (P less than 0.05), but no change in the fundic area. An important question following these findings is: What are the consequences of such aggravation of gastric congestion on the integrity of the gastric mucosa?\r"

The condition is rare, occurring in 0.1-0.5 per cent of patients with proven infectious mononucleosis. Splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice for these patients. However, because recent trends in the management of traumatic splenic rupture are moving towards nonoperative treatment with selected patients, a similar approach has been considered for the patient with spontaneous splenic rupture following IM. The major reason for avoiding splenectomy is the increased incidence of sepsis in splenectomized patients. Yet, splenic rupture is accompanied by hemorrhage and the risks associated with blood transfusion for ongoing hemorrhage are of similar magnitude as those of sepsis following splenectomy. In addition, the grossly abnormal spleens seen at operation tend to include large, contained hematomas that may also be prone to rupture. Therefore, operative management still appears to be the preferred treatment for spontaneous splenic rupture following IM. Splenectomy is curative, safe, and obviates the need for transfusion, extended hospitalization, and activity restriction.\r"

There was, however, no evidence of wound infection at the time of multisystem failure. Only later in his hospital course did the wound drain. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the wound and was the presumed etiologic agent in the patient's life-threatening illness. The patient recovered fully with supportive care, antibiotics, and surgical debridement of the inguinal hernia site. This case is discussed in the context of existing literature on the toxic shock syndrome. The site of infection is typically nonsuppurative, but the systemic manifestations are typically life threatening. The responsible organism is commonly believed to be a strain of S. aureus that expresses a toxin (TSS toxin-1) that effects multisystem failure, but which also diminishes the local inflammatory response and explains the benign appearance of the wound. Although this is a rare clinical entity, elective surgical procedures complicated by fatal TSS have been reported. Surgeons should understand this disease and the management necessary to avert mortality.\r"

The control group was closed with traditional placement of through-and-through retention sutures placed in a perpendicular direction to the wound. The experimental group was closed with retention sutures placed in a parallel direction to the wound as described below. Wound bursting strength was significantly (P less than 0.001) greater at one to five days in the experimental group compared with the control animals. In addition, inflammatory reaction and pressure necrosis were greater in the control group. It appears that parallel placement of sutures has less of a tendency to cut through tissue when subjected to the distracting forces on a midline wound.\r"

Three comparable groups of taper point cardiovascular needles were selected from different manufacturers for these biomechanical studies. The results of this testing demonstrated that needle geometry, needle composition, and the manufacturer were important determinants of needle performance. When needles of comparable size were evaluated, the biomechanical performance of cardiovascular needles manufactured by Ethicon, Inc., were superior to needles produced by other manufacturers. The superior performance characteristics of the cardiovascular needles produced by Ethicon, Inc., were related to their unique stainless steel alloy, American Society for Testing Materials 45500, which has greater yield and tensile strengths than the alloy used by the other manufacturers. Scanning electron microscopic photographs of the Ethicon, Inc., needle revealed a uniform taper point geometry without irregularities. The deformations of the points of cardiovascular needles produced by the other manufacturers could alter their performance.\r"

There was no statistical significant increase in the rate of wound sepsis when electrocautery was used in a fashion producing minimal nonviable tissue compared to specific vessel ligation. Electrocautery use for specific vessel hemostasis does not result in a higher wound infection rate in contaminated wounds.\r"

Mechanism of injury was gunshot wound (GSW), 82 per cent (.22 cal: 15.2%; greater than .38 cal: 84.8%); shotgun wound (SGW), 5 per cent; and stab wound (SW), 13 per cent. Overall mortality was 73 per cent, with GSW 78 per cent (.22 cal: 0%; greater than .38 cal: 92%), 67 per cent with SGW, and 43 per cent with SW. Average initial systolic blood pressure (ISBP) was 53 (0-130); 87 (0-120) in survivors; and 40 (0-130) in nonsurvivors (NS). Eighteen patients (32%) had no ISBP, with one survivor. Thirty (54%) patients had ISBP less than 70, with three survivors. Six Emergency Department (ED) thoracotomies were performed, with five patients surviving to reach the operating room (OR), and none surviving long-term. Ten patients died in the ED, 18 during surgical intervention, six within 24 hr, and seven greater than 24 hr postop. Average time from injury to OR was 75 minutes, with 122 minutes in survivors, and 53 minutes in nonsurvivors (P less than 0.05); 49 minutes in those dying in the OR; and 58 minutes in those surviving the OR but dying postop (NS). At surgery, six patients had thoracotomy before celiotomy for control of the thoracic aorta, with three surviving the OR and two surviving long-term. Survivors had 2.53 associated injuries; nonsurvivors had 2.89 (NS). No significant difference was noted in number or location of associated injuries between survivors and nonsurvivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of synthetic 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the treatment of osteoporosis. DESIGN: Two-year, double-blind, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Fifty postmenopausal women with vertebral fractures recruited by referral. INTERVENTION: Calcium intake was adjusted to 25 mmol/d (1000 mg/d) at baseline. Patients were then randomized to treatment with either calcitriol or placebo. During the study, calcium intake was reduced to 15 mmol/d (600 mg/d) and the dose of calcitriol was adjusted to maintain serum calcium less than 2.74 mmol/L (less than 11.0 mg/dL) or urine calcium less than 9.96 mmol/d (less than 400 mg/d). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 2 years, the mean dose of calcitriol in the treated group was 0.62 micrograms/d. Bone mineral density of the spine increased 1.94% with calcitriol therapy and decreased 3.92% with placebo (P = 0.001). Total body calcium increased 0.21% with calcitriol therapy and decreased 1.85% with placebo (P = 0.004). Patients receiving placebo had significant decreases in spine density (P = 0.0007) and total body calcium (P = 0.0004). There were no differences in vertebral fracture rates between the groups. Renal function studies were not statistically different between the groups after 2 years. CONCLUSION: The treatment of postmenopausal osteoporotic women with synthetic calcitriol for 2 years was associated with increases in spine density and total body calcium. No adverse effects on renal function were seen after long-term calcitriol therapy.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of clinical manifestations in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis; to determine renal and patient survival in these patients; to compare survival among patients treated with corticosteroids alone, corticosteroids plus intravenous cyclophosphamide or corticosteroids plus oral cyclophosphamide; and to assess the correlation of disease manifestations and treatment response with ANCA subtypes and serial autoantibody titers. DESIGN: Inception cohort study; mean follow-up of 24 months. SETTING: Collaborative network of 120 university and private practice nephrologists (The Glomerular Disease Collaborative Network). PARTICIPANTS: Seventy patients with ANCA and pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, of whom 59 were treated with either corticosteroids alone (14 patients), corticosteroids plus oral cyclophosphamide (30 patients), or corticosteroids plus intravenous cyclophosphamide (15 patients). MAIN RESULTS: Of the 70 patients, 18 had renal-limited disease (idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis); 15, nonpulmonary extrarenal disease consistent with polyarteritis nodosa; and 37, pulmonary disease consistent with Wegener granulomatosis or alveolar capillaritis. There were overlapping manifestations of disease between patients with autoantibodies producing a cytoplasmic pattern and patients with autoantibodies producing a perinuclear pattern; however, the perinuclear pattern occurred more frequently in patients with renal-limited disease. Renal and patient survival was 75% at 24 months, and no difference in survival was seen between patients with renal-limited disease and those with systemic disease. No differences in survival were seen between patients treated with oral cyclophosphamide and those treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide; however, the comparative data from patients treated with corticosteroids alone were inconclusive. In general, autoantibody titers correlated with response to treatment and disease activity, but there were exceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ANCA have various forms of necrotizing vascular inflammation, ranging from renal-limited disease to widespread systemic vasculitis, including polyarteritis nodosa and Wegener granulomatosis. Oral corticosteroids with either oral or intravenous cyclophosphamide appear to be equally effective therapy for ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis.\r"

SETTING: Emergency departments of the University of Illinois Hospital at Chicago, the University of Nebraska Medical Center at Omaha, and the Medical College of Virginia at Richmond. PATIENTS: Symptoms, signs, comorbidity data, and chest roentgenogram results were recorded for 1134 patients from Illinois (the derivation set), 150 patients from Nebraska, and 152 patients from Virginia (the validation sets). All patients presented to the emergency department and had a chest roentgenogram to evaluate fever or respiratory complaints. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Within the training set, temperature greater than 37.8 degrees C, pulse greater than 100 beats/min, rales, decreased breath sounds, and the absence of asthma were identified as significant predictors of radiographically proved pneumonia in a stepwise logistic regression model (P = 0.001). The logistic rule discriminated patients with and without pneumonia in the training set with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area of 0.82. In the validation sets, the rule discriminated pneumonia and nonpneumonia with ROC areas of 0.82 and 0.76 after adjusting for differences in disease prevalence (P greater than 0.2 compared with the training set). The predicted probability of having pneumonia for patients with different clinical findings corresponded closely with the incidence of pneumonia among patients with such findings in the three settings. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults presenting with acute respiratory illness, a prediction rule based on clinical findings accurately discriminated patients with and without radiographic pneumonia, and was used in two other samples of patients without significant decrement in discriminatory ability. This rule can be used by physicians to develop more effective strategies for detecting pneumonia and for helping to determine the need for radiologic study among patients with acute respiratory disease.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized control trial with four weekly inhalational treatments. SETTING: The nuclear medicine department of a voluntary hospital. PATIENTS: Sixteen men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thirteen patients (81%) completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients inhaled a solution of either saline and technetium-99m bound to diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid or sterile water, pentamidine (60 mg), and technetium-99m bound to human serum albumin. On weekly visits, the patients inhaled the aerosol solution using four methods: sitting, supine, sitting with an abdominal binder, and sitting and breathing from residual volume with a shallow inspiration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Deposition scans, obtained after each aerosol inhalation, were superimposed on each patient's equilibrium xenon scan, and a frequency distribution histogram was constructed. An asymmetry index was determined from this histogram. The lower the asymmetry index, the more homogeneous the aerosol distribution. Only use of the supine position showed a significant decrease in the asymmetry index (mean, 0.34 +/- 0.02 in the supine position, 0.48 +/- 0.03 in the sitting position; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosol distribution in the lungs was more uniform when administered to patients in the supine position. Patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine may benefit from inhalation in the supine position; these results should be verified by clinical study.\r"

RESULTS: Discriminant accuracy for diagnosis and prognosis was summarized in terms of pooled sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise thallium scintigraphy is useful in the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease, especially in patients with abnormal resting electrocardiograms, restricted exercise tolerance, and intermediate probability of having disease at the time of testing as well as of defining the prognosis of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, especially in those with previous myocardial infarction. Because of various shortcomings in the published record, however, the marginal discriminant accuracy and cost effectiveness of thallium scintigraphy compared with conventional clinical assessment and exercise electrocardiography remain controversial.\r"

Clinical guidelines can introduce into patient-physician decision making systematic consideration of a given technology's demonstrated efficacy and its likely advantages compared with its personal and its societal costs. Provided there is flexibility to allow for individual departures from consensus recommendations and for development of new technologies, applying clinical guidelines in health care can serve both individual patients and society and help to balance their respective needs for informed decision making and for resource allocation.\r"

DESIGN: Informal descriptive survey using a questionnaire administered by telephone, supplemented by comments, by opinions, and by examples solicited from the participating organizations. PARTICIPANTS: Eight prominent organizations representing prototypic approaches to guideline development; these organizations included three medical societies, two health care organizations, two insurers, and one private health benefits management company. RESULTS: Improving the quality of medical care was a stated goal of all eight surveyed organizations. However, their objectives have not been stated in operational terms, reflecting the lesser emphasis placed on methods and means for both implementing guidelines and evaluating their impact on health practices and outcomes. In contrast, several systematic methods for developing guidelines exist. They differ in the stress placed on formal literature reviews, reliance on local as opposed to national experts, and formal methods of group judgment, but no evidence exists on which approaches produce sounder and more usable guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines are being vigorously promoted as a means to improve the effectiveness of the health care system. Current initiatives show both strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the attention now paid to the development of guidelines needs to be matched by attention to implementation strategies and to the scientific evaluation of their effectiveness in real clinical settings. Also, more agreement is needed on acceptable methods for developing guidelines, assessing their content, and evaluating their impact on professional behavior, patient outcomes, and health care costs. Fortunately, several initiatives to bring greater order and quality to this field are under way.\r"

  ".W": "Many important advances in medical care are first reported in the biomedical literature, but physicians find the literature overwhelming and, therefore, are often unaware of advances. This article examines the ways in which peer-reviewed clinical journals contribute to this problem and proposes some solutions for both their editors and clinical readers. Peer-reviewed clinical journals impede the dissemination of validated advances to practitioners by mixing a few rigorous studies (communications from scientists to practitioners) with many preliminary investigations (communications from scientists to scientists). Journals wishing to improve communication with practitioners should feature rigorous studies of the nature, cause, prognosis, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease and should feature sound clinical review articles (communications from practitioners to practitioners). Additional strategies for improving communication between medical scientists and practitioners include improving publication standards for clinical journals, proving more informative abstracts for clinical articles, fostering the development of derivative literature services, and enhancing practitioners' skills in critically appraising the medical literature.\r"

Photophobia was improved subjectively in 25% of patients who had undergone prior angiography at a higher flash setting. In addition, patient cooperation was improved as evidenced by a decrease in the frequency of photographic artifacts and uninterpretable photographs compared with prior angiograms done using Kodak TRI-X Pan film (ASA 400). T-MAX yielded excellent resolution, but its grain size was slightly greater than that of TRI-X Pan. The use of ultra-high speed film and reduced light intensity may benefit the patient and improve photographic quality in some individuals with photophobia.\r"

Hematocrit, blood and plasma viscosity, whole blood filterability, cell deformability, and fibrinogen levels were investigated. Thirty-five subjects of similar age, sex, and risk factors of diabetes and hypertension served as controls. Our results showed that blood viscosity is higher in patients with occlusion and particularly in those with severe retinal ischemia. Statistical analysis showed a direct correlation between blood viscosity and hematocrit.\r"

Teflon remains the quickest and least expensive procedure, but further experience with stroboscopic and other voice analyses reveals that the other procedures demonstrate some superiority in phonatory quality over Teflon. In this author's hands, the nerve transfer offers the best opportunity to achieve a normal phonatory voice. In addition, it is the only one of the three procedures that leaves the vocal cord entirely undisturbed--important in the event one of the other two procedures becomes necessary.\r"

Although both endoscopic and external approaches have been described, the endoscopic laser technique is more desirable because it requires no incision and allows for the immediate assessment of airway size. Eleven patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis treated by endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy were presented in 1984. At that time, 10 of the 11 patients had been successfully decannulated. Follow-up on that group of patients revealed that 7 of the 10 successfully treated patients remain decannulated with a good airway, although 2 of these patients required a revision procedure to excise a granuloma. One patient failed at 15 months and has failed two subsequent revision operations, and 2 patients have been lost to follow-up. Since 1984, 17 additional patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis have been treated by the authors using the same endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy technique; all have been successfully managed, with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. The technique of this operation will be reviewed. This study demonstrates the clinical usefulness of endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy in the treatment of bilateral vocal cord paralysis.\r"

The plates were tolerated well by the patients; there were no major complications. Rigid fixation using miniplates for laryngeal reconstruction has unique advantages over the use of wires. It offers the advantages of rigid and immediate stabilization with the ability to bridge large defects. It can be an alternative to existing techniques of laryngeal reconstruction.\r"

Unilateral vocal fold reinnervation can overcome this drawback and, when used in conjunction with surgical medialization, may offer return of function very close to normal. Twenty-nine patients with unrecovered unilateral vocal fold paralysis and/or fixation of the cricoarytenoid joint have been managed by use of a Silastic implant combined with unilateral vocal fold reinnervation with no complications. Voice improvement has been assessed on preoperative and postoperative voice recordings. The combined surgical techniques for reinnervation and a modification of Silastic implantation via the laryngeal framework approach are reported.\r"

In normal epithelium, strong expression of CK-19 was consistently observed only in the basal layer as basic CK, while expression of CK-13 showed a completely reverse pattern, being expressed only in suprabasal layers as stratification-related CK. Characteristic changes in expression pattern of these two CKs were observed in accordance with the degree of epithelial disorders and differentiation of carcinoma. Cytokeratin 1, as keratinization-associated CK, was observed only in keratinized cells of hyperplastic epithelia and well-differentiated carcinomas. These findings may be useful in evaluating epithelial disorders and classifying carcinomas more objectively, and may assist earlier detection of carcinoma when used with standard histologic techniques.\r"

Twenty-nine patients were tested with sinusoidal rotation of three different magnitudes at four different frequencies. We also searched for auditory recruitment in each patient via tests of auditory brain stem responses, acoustic reflexes, and loudness balance and discomfort level. Analysis of vestibular responses indicated, on average, a linear relationship between stimulus magnitude and response magnitude, ie, doubling the stimulus magnitude resulted in twice the response magnitude. Meniere's patients did not yield results significantly different (although they were more variable) from those of the normal subjects. The vestibular responses of patients with auditory recruitment did not differ systematically from those of patients without auditory recruitment. We conclude that vestibular recruitment, if it exists in patients with Meniere's disease, is not demonstrated by sinusoidal rotational testing.\r"

In another experiment, a 14 degrees C airstream was blown into the external auditory canal. Colloidal carbon was used to trace leakage sites at the light and electron microscopic levels. All mediators tested and the 14 degrees C airstream resulted in an increased number of leaking vessels in the pars flaccida and the middle ear mucosa. The leakage sites were restricted to capillaries and postcapillary venules. Increased numbers of degranulated pars flaccida mast cells were observed for SP only. Interendothelial gaps formed in leakage vessels after administration of mediators and stimulation of the external auditory canal with a 14 degrees C airstream. Also, cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures within the endothelial cells increased in number following SP and histamine treatment, suggesting that an increased permeability in experimental otitis media does not occur exclusively through interendothelial gaps.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the influence of central cholinergic deficit on cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD), we compared the neuropsychological performance of a group of 20 patients who were treated with anticholinergic drugs (mean daily dose, 10.2 mg) with that of a group of 20 patients who received no anticholinergics. The two groups were matched for all the variables of parkinsonism and levodopa therapy. At the dose used, there was no significant difference between the two groups of patients for intellectual, visuospatial, instrumental, and memory function. In contrast, in the group that received anticholinergics severe impairment was observed on tests believed to assess frontal lobe function. These results suggest that the lesion of the ascending cholinergic neurons, which has been demonstrated post mortem in PD, may play a role in the subcorticofrontal behavioral impairment of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect of posthypoxic glucose supplement in a neonatal hypoxic-ischemic animal model. Seven-day-old rats underwent bilateral ligation of the carotid arteries, followed by exposure to an 8% oxygen atmosphere for 1 hour. The extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage was assessed histologically 72 hours later. Glucose load immediately after the end of the hypoxic exposure reduced the volume of neocortical infarction to 37% of the unsupplemented value, and attenuated ischemic damage in the striatum and the dentate gyrus. At the end of the hypoxic exposure, the brain level of glucose was 0.3 mmol/kg and the level of lactate 9 mmol/kg. Glucose supplement produced a rapid rise in brain glucose level to 3 to 5 mmol/kg over the next 2 hours. Lactate in both brain and plasma gradually fell toward the baseline level during the first hour of recovery. Posthypoxic glucose supplement slightly retarded lactate restitution. At any period of this neonatal model, brain lactate levels did not exceed the toxic level, which is postulated to be responsible for cerebral infarction in adult ischemic models. These results illustrate the important role of glucose in the development of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and the fact that full cortical infarction can develop even if brain lactate levels are low.\r"

Structural damage was assessed by CT. Metabolic disruption was assessed using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography (PET). Median initial serum glucose concentration was 155 mg/dl (6.7 mM). Clinical recovery was significantly poorer in patients with initial serum glucose levels higher than the median (p less than 0.05, chi square). PET tended to show normal results or minor abnormalities in patients with initial glucose levels less than the median, as opposed to lobar or multilobe abnormalities in patients with levels that were higher than the median (p less than 0.05, Kendall's Tau b). The severity of hypometabolism in the ischemic region, expressed as the percent asymmetry of local cerebral glucose metabolism between homologous brain regions, was greater in patients with initial glycemia concentrations higher than the median (p less than 0.001, t test). Relationships of serum glucose level with metabolic derangement and structural damage, but not outcome, held true in patients without a history of diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "A primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) presented as a cerebral hemispheric mass in a 33-year-old man. Bone marrow metastases were discovered 11 months later. A cell line (CHP707m) was derived from these metastases. In culture, the cells showed features of neuronal differentiation, forming short neurites and synthesizing low-molecular-weight neurofilament protein. Northern blotting showed the tumor cells express nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor messenger RNA, and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting demonstrated NGF receptors on the cell surface. Western blotting showed CHP707m NGF receptors are truncated. The receptors are functional; they bind iodine 125-labeled mouse NGF with an affinity of 1.6 x 10(-9) M, and short-term treatment with NGF induces expression by the tumor cells of the proto-oncogene, c-fos. Although CHP707m is the first central nervous system PNET cell line proven to express NGF receptors, immunohistological survey of tissue sections prepared from human central nervous system PNETs showed that 13 of 35 contained NGF receptor-positive tumor cells. Thus, more than one-third of such tumors might be responsive to the effects of NGF.\r"

In this study, digitized records of individual motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) elicited by incremental stimulation in vivo were arithmetically combined in a computer simulation of CMAP generation. Through simulation of possible phase interaction patterns of individual MUAPs, we have shown that abnormal temporal dispersion alone can produce reductions in CMAP area of up to 50%, values that are commonly thought to represent conduction block. Furthermore, by simulating conduction block without excessive temporal dispersion in defined subpopulations of axons, we have demonstrated the importance of the fastest conducting (largest MUAP) axons in determining CMAP amplitude and area. In conclusion, measurements of CMAP amplitude and area in determining conduction block may be misleading if there is significant abnormal temporal dispersion, and quantitation of the degree of conduction block is difficult without knowledge of which subpopulations of axons are affected.\r"

The nucleus basalis of Meynert also contains interneurons and afferents that may modulate its functioning. In the present study we examined neurochemical markers for neuropeptides, amino acid neurotransmitters, and monoaminergic neurotransmitters in postmortem samples of the nucleus basalis in 16 control subjects and 30 patients with AD. There were no significant changes in glutamate, aspartate, taurine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and catecholamines; however, concentrations of serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptophol were significantly reduced. Choline acetyltransferase activity was significantly reduced, consistent with previous reports. Galanin immunoreactivity was significantly increased twofold in the patients with AD, but there were no significant changes in substance P, somatostatin, or neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity. Since galanin inhibits acetylcholine release, and produces cognitive deficits in animals, increased galanin immunoreactivity in the nucleus basalis of Meynert in AD may contribute to the cognitive deficits that characterize the illness.\r"

Venous blood was sampled from both the external jugular and cubital fossa ipsilateral to the side of headache. Plasma levels of neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide were determined using sensitive radioimmunoassays for each peptide, and values for the cubital fossa and external jugular and a control population were compared. A substantial elevation of the calcitonin gene-related peptide level in the external jugular but not the cubital fossa blood was seen in both classic and common migraine. The increase seen in classic migraine was greater than that seen with common migraine. The other peptides measured were unaltered. This finding may have importance in the pathophysiology of migraine.\r"

At various intervals after infection, subcultures of serial dilutions of blood, lung, and brain homogenates were performed in fibroblast tissue cultures for determination of parasitic loads. Pyrimethamine (18.5 mg/kg per day), sulfadiazine (375 mg/kg per day), and clindamycin (300 mg/kg per day) were administered for 10 days from day 1 or day 4 after infection. Untreated control mice died within 9 days and showed early and predominant lung involvement. All mice treated with sulfadiazine administered from day 1 survived and were apparently healthy; parasitic loads decreased early after treatment, but a relapse was observed 5 days after the cessation of therapy. When pyrimethamine was administered from day 1, 7 of 11 mice died within 25 days; by determination of parasitic loads, the effect of pyrimethamine was only demonstrable from day 6, and a relapse was constantly observed after the cessation of therapy. When pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine were administered in combination, 100% of mice survived; when therapy was started at day 1, parasites remained undetectable; in mice treated from day 4, parasites were eradicated by day 8 but infection relapsed 8 days after the cessation of therapy. All mice treated with clindamycin from day 1 or day 4 died within 10 days, but parasitemia was always undetectable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These compounds have been defined as the V-factor growth requirement. We have previously shown that the internalization of nicotinamide riboside is energy dependent and carrier mediated with saturation kinetics. Thionicotinamide riboside, 3-pyridinealdehyde riboside, 3-acetylpyridine riboside, and 3-aminopyridine riboside were prepared from their corresponding NAD analogs. These compounds and several other nicotinamide riboside analogs were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of H. influenzae and for their ability to block the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside by H. influenzae. 3-Aminopyridine riboside blocked the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside and inhibited the growth of H. influenzae when NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside served as the V factor. The antibacterial activity of 3-aminopyridine riboside was found to be specific for H. influenzae but had no effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. In additional experiments by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, it was determined that whole cells of H. influenzae degrade 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide to 3-aminopyridine riboside, which is then internalized. Inside the cell, 3-aminopyridine riboside has the ability to interfere with the growth of H. influenzae by an undetermined mechanism.\r"

Ampicillin MICs were determined with seven ampicillin-resistant, non-beta-lactamase-producing (AmprNBLP) isolates by using HTM and supplemented brain heart infusion (sBHI) agar. Ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate disk tests with 16 AmprNBLP strains, 18 ampicillin-susceptible (Amps) isolates, and 17 ampicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-producing (AmprBLP) strains were performed by using five media: laboratory-prepared HTM (PHTM), commercial HTM (CHTM), sBHI, enriched chocolate agar, and Mueller-Hinton chocolate agar. We observed that five of seven and three of seven AmprNBLP strains were misclassified as susceptible with PHTM (MIC, less than 2 micrograms/ml) with inocula of 10(3) and 10(5) CFU, respectively, but were resistant with sBHI (MIC, greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Whereas Mueller-Hinton chocolate agar and enriched chocolate agar plates supported the growth of all 51 strains by the disk tests, 37% (19 of 51) and 8% (4 of 51) of strains did not grow on PHTM and CHTM, respectively. Lack of growth on PHTM was observed for all three phenotypes; 7 of 18 Amps, 4 of 17 AmprBLP, and 8 of 16 AmprNBLP strains did not grow. The four strains that did not grow on CHTM were all AmprNBLP isolates. Zone sizes were significantly larger on PHTM than on the other media. Of the strains that were evaluable by the new National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines with either PHTM or CHTM, all Amps strains were classified as susceptible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A structural analog, 5'-([(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino)-5'-deoxy adenosine (MDL 73811), of decarboxy S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the product of the reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) decarboxylase (DC), was found to inhibit Trypanosoma brucei brucei AdoMet DC. The inhibition was time dependent (tau 50, 0.3 min), exhibited pseudo-first-order kinetics (Ki, 1.5 microM), and was apparently irreversible. The natural substrate of the reaction, AdoMet, protected the enzyme from inactivation, suggesting that MDL 73811 was directed at the enzyme active site and was probably catalytically activated. Administration of MDL 73811 to T. b. brucei-infected rats resulted in rapid inhibition of AdoMet DC activity, a decrease in spermidine, and an increase in putrescine in the trypanosomes isolated from treated rats. Treatment of T. b. brucei-infected mice with MDL 73811 (20 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally twice daily for 4 days) resulted in cures of the trypanosome infections. Additionally, drug-resistant T. brucei rhodesiense infections in mice were cured by either a combination of MDL 73811 (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally three times per day for 5 days) and relatively low oral doses of alpha-difluoromethylornithine or MDL 73811 (50 mg/kg per day for 7 days) administered alone in implanted miniosmotic pumps. These data suggest that MDL 73811 and, perhaps, other inhibitors of AdoMet DC have potential for therapeutic use in various forms of African trypanosomiasis.\r"

  ".W": "Enoxacin is a fluorinated quinolone with potential clinical use in the treatment of serious infections. Twenty-three patients (age, 19 to 87 years) with different degrees of renal function, including a group undergoing chronic hemodialysis, received enoxacin (400 mg) by intravenous infusion (1 h). Blood samples were collected before infusion; at the end of infusion; and at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min and 3, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h after infusion. Enoxacin and oxoenoxacin concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- standard deviation) were calculated by using a noncompartmental PK model according to creatinine clearances (in milliliters per minute). Total clearance of enoxacin decreased from 4.95 +/- 1.16 ml/min per kg in the group with normal creatinine clearance to 0.76 +/- 0.21 ml/min per kg in the patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance, less than 15 ml/min), whereas the elimination half-life increased from 4.5 +/- 1.0 to 20 +/- 5 h, respectively. The elimination of oxoenoxacin (the main metabolite of enoxacin) in urine was markedly decreased when creatinine clearance was less than 15 ml/min. Hemodialysis removed an insignificant amount of enoxacin and oxoenoxacin. These data indicate that as creatinine clearance falls below 30 ml/min, the daily enoxacin dose should be reduced by half. During prolonged administration of enoxacin to patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 ml/min, the accumulation of oxoenoxacin might lead to unexpected side effects.\r"

Asexual multiplication occurred, with the maximum numbers of parasites usually being observed between 24 and 48 h after infection. Gametocytes were also found, but their numbers were relatively small compared with those of the asexual stages. A study was made of the effect on parasite development of 20 antimicrobial agents, most of which were anticoccidial or antimalarial agents. The majority of the drugs had a limited inhibitory effect on parasite development, but usually only at high concentrations. The two most active drugs were monensin and halofuginone, which reduced parasite multiplication by more than 90% at high concentrations. In the case of monensin, however, inhibition of parasite development at higher concentrations was due, at least in part, to a toxic effect of the drug on the host cells.\r"

Each of these analogs demonstrated competitive inhibition of both enzymes. Ki values for inhibition of FIV RT by these three inhibitors were 3.3, 6.7, and 1.8 nM, respectively; Ki values for inhibition of the HIV enzyme were 6.5, 5.9, and 8.3 nM, respectively. Ratios of the Ki for the inhibitor to the Km for the substrate were also determined for each inhibitor, and no differences between the two enzymes greater than threefold were observed. Inhibition constants for 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate and 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate were determined for FIV RT, and these were similar to published values for HIV RT. The activities of three dideoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates against FIV RT were determined; ddGTP was slightly more potent than ddTTP, whereas both were much more effective than ddCTP. The activity of a noncompetitive inhibitor, phosphonoformate, was also examined with the FIV enzyme; it was much more active with poly(rA)-oligo(dT) as the template-primer than with poly(rC)-oligo(dG) or poly(rI)-oligo(dC).\r"

Extra- and intracellular bacteria were counted at days 4 and 7 after inoculation.

Compared with controls, clarithromycin and rifabutin slowed the intracellular replication of the three strains (at day 7 after inoculation, P was less than 0.01 for the first strain and less than 0.001 for the two others). Sulfisoxazole was ineffective against the three strains. Clarithromycin was as effective as rifabutin. Clarithromycin plus rifabutin was as effective as each single agent. Clarithromycin plus sulfisoxazole was as effective as clarithromycin alone.\r"

  ".W": "There is no consistently reliable treatment for endocarditis resulting from chronic Coxiella burnetii infection, the causative agent of Q fever. Although certain antibiotics are recommended on the basis of their in vitro bactericidal activities, results of therapy with these antibiotics are often disappointing. To evaluate whether the currently recommended antibiotic susceptibility tests for C. burnetii give misleading results because of continued division of uninfected cells, thereby resulting in the dilution of infected cells and, hence, a false picture of antibiotic efficacy, we blocked cell division during antibiotic susceptibility testing with cycloheximide. Using this new method, we found that the currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of Q fever, doxycycline, pefloxacin, and rifampin, did not reduce the ratio of infected to noninfected cells (either L929 or P388D1) by 9 days postinfection. To test the hypothesis that this lack of antibacterial activity is due to antibiotic inactivation by the low pH of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is found, we used alkalinizing lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine or amantadine) concurrently with doxycycline. This resulted in the sterilization of C. burnetii infection in P388D1 cells. This finding seems to confirm our suspicion that the acidic conditions of the phagolysosomes in which C. burnetii is located inhibit antibiotic activity. This inhibition can be reversed in vitro when lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents are used.\r"

Inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, however, did not show synergistic activity with tubulozole. Colcemid, on the other hand, had an effect on protein synthesis similar to that seen with the tubulozoles. Furthermore, combinations of the tubulozole isomers with compounds known to interact with tubulin inhibited malaria in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion. Therefore, the inhibition might be elicited by interaction with tubulin or some other component of the microtubules. This is remarkable insofar as only one of the tubulozole isomers affects mammalian cells by binding to tubulin.\r"

Two phenotypic classes of mutants of this organism which were blocked in the addition of mycaminose to tylactone (compound 6) accumulated these compounds. These compounds were not produced by mutants which were blocked in lactone synthesis, in steps beyond mycaminose addition, or by the wild-type strain. Synthesis of these compounds, like synthesis of tylosin, was inhibited by the addition of cerulenin. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 were partially interconvertible by these mutants; but they were not produced from the degradation of tylactone and they were not directly incorporated into tylosin by intact cells. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were equivalent to that of a predicted intermediate (S. Yue, J. S. Duncan, Y. Yamamoto, and C. R. Hutchinson, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109:1253-1255, 1987) in the biosynthesis of tylactone. The ketone (compound 4) reported previously (N. D. Jones, M. O. Chaney, H. A. Kirst, G. M. Wild, R. H. Baltz, R. L. Hamill, and J. W. Paschal, J. Antibiot. 35:420-425, 1982) appears to be the decarboxylation product of the intermediate following that represented by compound 1.

Incubation temperature affected results with amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, and SCH 39304, producing better agreement at 35 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. Agreement between methods was better with an inoculum size of 10(2) than with one of 10(4) yeast cells per ml in testing fluconazole or SCH 39304, and the discrepancies seen with a higher incubation temperature and a larger inoculum appeared to be additive. However, inoculum size did not seem to affect agreement between methods in testing amphotericin B, flucytosine, or ketoconazole. Regardless of test conditions, macrodilution broth MICs of amphotericin B for different isolates were strikingly higher than microdilution test MICs, with mean differences being greater than ninefold under some test conditions. We conclude that for most currently available antifungal agents, an incubation temperature of 35 degrees C and a starting yeast inoculum of less than 10(4) cells per ml improve the agreement between macro- and microdilution broth tests.\r"

Overall, 64.7% of Bacteroides species and 41.1% of fusobacteria were beta-lactamase positive. Among the Bacteroides species, positivity rates were highest for B. bivius (85.0%), followed by B. splanchnicus (83.3%), B. eggerthii (77.8%), and B. oralis (77.1%); 54.5% of black-pigmented Bacteroides species were beta-lactamase positive. Among the fusobacteria, Fusobacterium mortiferum showed the highest rate of beta-lactamase positivity (76.9%). MICs of amoxicillin (128 micrograms/ml) and ticarcillin (64 micrograms/ml) for 90% of all beta-lactamase-positive strains were reduced to 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, with the addition of clavulanate. MICs of amoxicillin and ticarcillin for 90% of all beta-lactamase-negative strains were 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively, and greater than or equal to 98.4% of the strains were susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. Of the beta-lactamase-producing strains, 45.9% were susceptible to amoxicillin at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and 93.4% were susceptible to ticarcillin at less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml; the addition of clavulanate raised the rates to 90.4 and 100%, respectively. All strains were susceptible to cefoxitin, imipenem, and metronidazole. The activity of amoxicillin against 29 beta-lactamase-producing strains (10 Bacteroides species and 19 fusobacteria) was not enhanced by the addition of clavulanate; however, 82.7% of these strains were susceptible to amoxicillin, and all were susceptible to ticarcillin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SCH-39304 was an effective as amphotericin B alone and fluconazole alone for the prevention of disseminated candidiasis. SCH-39304 alone and fluconazole alone were as effective as amphotericin B plus flucytosine for early treatment of subacute disseminated candidiasis. When treatment was delayed for 5 days to establish chronic disseminated candidiasis, SCH-39304 was less effective than amphotericin B plus flucytosine. In comparison with different treatment regimens, SCH-39304 was more effective in early and preventive treatment. Thus, SCH-39304 was comparable to treatment control regimens in prevention and early treatment of subacute disseminated candidiasis. SCH-39304 also was most effective in granulocytopenic rabbits with disseminated candidiasis when used for prevention or early treatment.\r"

This aminoglycoside resistance phenotype is new in enterococci. The genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and MLS antibiotics in this strain were carried on a plasmid, pIP810, that was self-transferable to to other Enterococcus strains. Resistance to tobramycin and structurally related aminoglycosides, kanamycin, neomycin, and dibekacin, was due to synthesis of a 4',4\"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase. Homology was detected by hybridization between pIP810 DNA and a probe specific for a gene encoding an enzyme with identical site specificity in staphylococci. The bacteriostatic activity of amikacin apparently was not affected by the presence of the enzyme, although it was modified in vitro. However, the bactericidal activity of amikacin and the synergism of this aminoglycoside with penicillin were abolished.\r"

The structural gene encodes a polypeptide product which differs by 9 residues from the p453 (SHV-1) PIT-2 enzyme determined by peptide sequencing. The significance of each mutation was assessed by alignment of amino acid sequences and comparisons with the Staphylococcus aureus PC1 penicillinase crystal structure. Structural similarities between SHV-1 and class A beta-lactamases are extensive, with amino acid identities of 88.9% between SHV-1 and LEN-1, 91.8% between SHV-1 and OHIO-1, and 63.7% between SHV-1 and TEM-1.\r"

The kinetics of cell death were followed by spectrofluorometry with the nucleic acid-binding compound ethidium bromide. It was found that the rapid killing effect that is exerted by AmB on Leishmania promastigotes was even faster after their transformation into amastigotelike forms. Binding studies of AmB to Leishmania membranes by circular dichroism indicated that heat transformation modified it from noncooperative to cooperative binding, decreasing the amount of antibiotic that bound to the membranes. Thus, the increased rate of ethidium bromide incorporation into transformed cells was not related either to the amount of AmB bound or to an increased amount of ergosterol in the membrane (the ergosterol/phospholipid ratio was four times smaller after heat shock). An increase in the Mg2+ content of the external aqueous solution was able to prevent the AmB-induced incorporation of ethidium bromide into Leishmania promastigotes to a greater extent (Ki = 13.8 mM) than it was into heat-transformed cells (Ki = 64 mM), suggesting that there were significant changes at the Leishmania cell surface on heat transformation. The significance of these results for understanding the mechanism of action of AmB on sensitive organisms is discussed.\r"

Whether steroid metabolism in follicular wall keratinocytes of acne-prone skin plays a role in the development and maintenance of acne vulgaris is unknown at this time. The enzymatic hydrolysis of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate to dehydroepiandrosterone and of estrone sulfate to estrone in cultured epidermal keratinocytes has been demonstrated. Thus, we sought to establish whether steroid sulfatase activity in freshly obtained epidermal tissue (greater than 90% keratinocytes) from acne-prone skin in patients with acne vulgaris was altered when compared with that in epidermal tissue from non-acne-prone skin in the same individuals. We found that there were no differences in the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis of steroid sulfates in epidermis of acne-prone and non-acne-prone skin; however, the rate of estrone sulfate hydrolysis was two to eight times greater than that of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in all of the tissues evaluated in this study.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the clinically most atypical pigmented lesion removed from each of 142 patients with newly diagnosed sporadic melanoma. The specimens were categorized as to the type of nevus, ie, junctional or compound, presence of congenital features, and degree of nuclear atypicality--presence of nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, and prominent nucleoli--of intraepidermal nevomelanocytes. The frequency of nuclear abnormality was graded as 1 (rare cells), 2 (10% to 50% of cells), or 3 (greater than 50% of cells) for each nuclear parameter. Among all lesions, 42 (29.6%) were junctional nevi, 74 (52.1%) were compound nevi, and 14 (9.9%) were dermal nevi. Eighteen percent of the total were either dysplastic nevi (23 cases) or malignant melanoma in situ (three cases). Fourteen nevi (9.9%) had congenital features. There were 12 junctional and 39 compound nevi and one dermal nevus that exhibited nuclear abnormality, but only four junctional nevi compared with 19 compound nevi had sufficient atypia for a designation of dysplastic nevus. Only two nevi with congenital features demonstrated any nuclear abnormality, and these were clearly nondysplastic. Thus, among nevi surgically removed as the clinically most atypical lesion in this study, compound nevi were much more likely to demonstrate nuclear atypia (and dysplasia) than were other nevi, ie, junctional or dermal nevi, or nevi with congenital features.\r"

Direct immunofluorescence is positive for intercellular IgG, while indirect immunofluorescence is commonly positive only at low titers; HLA correlations have not been studied.

The groups at risk for development of transfusion-associated graft-vs-host disease, the clinical presentation and course, and methods of diagnosis are summarized. Prevention of this highly fatal condition is possible by irradiation of blood products given to patients at risk, but problems remain in determining the groups that warrant such measures.

This compound variant of blue nevus is an uncommon lesion that has not been previously identified as a distinct histologic entity. Immunoperoxidase staining for S100 protein and counterstaining with azure B distinguished the presence of melanocytes among numerous melanophages within the dermis. The compound variant of blue nevus can be distinguished histologically from combined blue nevus, pigmented spindle cell nevus, malignant melanoma, and melanosis due to a regressed malignant melanoma. The six lesions were from three men and three women whose ages ranged from 11 to 51 years (mean, 31 years). Three lesions were located on the trunk, two on the extremities, and one on the head. After a mean follow-up period of 47 months (range, 38 to 58 months), there was no evidence of recurrence.\r"

With the use of thin-layer chromatography, methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) and 5-methoxypsoralen were identified in the extract from a similar celery root. The biologic activity of this extract, as evaluated with the semiquantitative Candida albicans inhibition technique, indicated a total psoralen dose of approximately 45 mg. Substantial amounts of psoralen may be absorbed from vegetables, such as celery, and under unusual circumstances, this may constitute a health hazard.\r"

The inclusions were needle shaped and were considered to be \"crystal ghosts,\" presumably of tyrosine.

  ".W": "Thirty three children with poorly controlled epilepsy, and six new patients, were treated with slow release carbamazepine. Twelve of the former had a reduction in the number of seizures of more than half, and 10 had fewer side effects. Three of the new patients stopped having seizures. Variations in plasma concentrations between doses was significantly less when patients took the slow release preparation (22%) compared with the standard preparation (41%). Slow release carbamazepine may improve the conditions of children whose seizures are poorly controlled.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty two babies under the age of 6 months who were admitted with gastroenteritis completed a study of gradual refeeding compared with abrupt refeeding after a period of rehydration. There was no difference in the incidence of recurrence of diarrhoea due to lactose intolerance, effect on weight, or duration of hospital stay. Twenty six babies (42%) had recurrence of diarrhoea after refeeding, all of whom settled with the introduction of a lactose free soya based formula. Well nourished babies under 6 months of age with mild to moderately severe gastroenteritis can be fed immediately with full strength milk feeds after rehydration. The introduction of a lactose free soya based preparation may provide an alternative to repeated attempts at regrading with cows' milk feeds in those patients with lactose intolerance.\r"
