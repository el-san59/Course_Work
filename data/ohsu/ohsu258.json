After 30 d, seven hamsters from each group were killed and all running activity was discontinued. Remaining hamsters were separately assigned to two groups of seven and fed either a low-fat or high-fat diet for 7 d and then killed. Voluntary running increased food intake and weight gain and reduced body fat (52%). Cessation of exercise greatly enhanced body fat gain. High-fat diet enhanced weight gain. Increased energy intake during postexercise period appeared to cause enhanced body fat gain. The high-fat diet suppressed lipogenic enzyme activities. Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels were not affected by exercise or cessation of exercise.\r"

In humans, we are able to estimate body composition only by indirect methods, which have been used to validate the TOBEC instrument. Relationships between TOBEC and body composition were examined using direct carcass analysis of 24 pigs differing widely in body weight and composition (48-137 kg and 14-45% fat, respectively). Highly significant correlations (p less than 0.0001) were found between body conductivity and empty-body water (H2O) (r = 0.979), empty-body FFM (r = 0.980), empty-body crude protein (r = 0.962), and empty-body potassium (r = 0.949). Prediction of empty-body H2O or FFM from TOBEC had a SEE of 2.1 or 2.8 kg, respectively. Thus, the TOBEC method can predict body H2O and FFM over a wide range of body weight and fatness.\r"

This may have been due to variable interactions between the vitamins and minerals in the supplement that prevented their being adequately absorbed.

Despite a decrease in absorption from 70 to 17%, this represents a very large fat intake. Fat absorption improved when medium-chain triglycerides or octanoic acid replaced corn oil (both p less than 0.01). Linoleic acid was absorbed from the diet less than corn oil (p less than 0.01). Dry ox bile reduced fat absorption (p less than 0.05); lipase and an antacid had no effect. Corn oil perfused alone was absorbed better than from the diet (p less than 0.01). Data with 14C-triolein was confirmed by dry-weight disappearance of the diet and by net intestinal water balance. Usual feeding underutilizes a large reserve for fat absorption. This reserve should be considered in therapeutic nutrition.\r"

N loss averaged 16 and 17% on each balance. N in the sputum was up to 4.5% of absorbed N intake. At the peak of infection, protein synthesis, degradation, and urinary 3-methylhistidine were significantly higher than during recovery (31%, 28%, and 60%, respectively). On recovery a significant fall in blood sugar, albumin, morning cortisol and sputum N and a rise in prealbumin was found. Basal metabolic rate and N balance did not change. For patients in the fed state, active infection is associated with higher rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Antimicrobial treatment alters protein dynamics but does not alter measured N balance or the difference between measured protein synthesis and breakdown.\r"

Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis with histological score as the dependent variable gave significant F values for BW and L but not for A. Patients with severe damage had higher BW than patients with mild damage. The group with BW greater than 110% showed a higher histological score.

Individual fractional absorption values were normalized to permit pooling of the data. The coefficient of variation (CVs) for absorption for the three groups ranged from 10.57 to 12.79% with the size of the CV increasing with interstudy duration. One other published study presenting replicate absorption values was analyzed in a similar fashion and was found to have a CV of absorption of 9.78%. From these data we estimate that when the standard double-isotope method is used to measure Ca absorption there is approximately 10% variability around any given absorption value within an individual human subject and that roughly two-thirds of this represents real biological variability in absorption.\r"

At ages 9 and 15 mo significant differences were encountered in all measures of Fe nutriture in favor of the fortified group (p less than 0.001). Anemia (Hg less than 110 g/L) was present in 25.7% of unfortified infants compared with only 2.5% in those fortified at age 15 mo. Saturation of transferrin less than 9% was present in 33.8% and serum ferritin less than 10 micrograms/L in 39.1% of the nonfortified infants. The figures for the fortified group were 7 and 8.5% respectively. The efficiency of the fortified acidified milk in eradicating Fe deficiency in the infants while discouraging use by other family members make this milk a useful targeted product in programs of supplementary food distribution in the underdeveloped world.\r"

When the absorption from bread and nut meals (walnuts, almonds, peanuts, and hazelnuts) was compared with that from bread meals, the overall geometric mean absorption from the nut meals (1.8%) was significantly less than from the bread meals alone (6.6%, t = 9.8, p less than 0.0005). In contrast, coconut did not reduce absorption significantly. All the nuts tested contained significant amounts of two known inhibitors of Fe absorption (phytates and polyphenols) but the amounts in coconut were significantly less than in the other nuts. Fifty milligrams ascorbic acid overcame the inhibitory effects of two nuts that were tested (Brazil nuts and peanuts). This is different from that found previously for soy protein, another potent inhibitor of Fe absorption.\r"

No differences were observed among the groups in demographic characteristics (eg, age, height, weight, reported number of menstrual days per year) or total Fe intake. However, those women consuming red meat as their predominant source of protein demonstrated superior Fe status, especially reflected by higher serum ferritin concentrations (RM = 30.5 micrograms/L; FP = 15.6 micrograms/L; and LV = 19.1 micrograms/L). Thus, form rather than amount of dietary Fe appears to be most influential on Fe status; the basis for the distinctly lower Fe stores among heavy users of fish and/or poultry remains to be determined.\r"

The frequency and severity of side effects were also recorded. Fe administration resulted in an increase in hemoglobin concentration in all anemic individuals but approximately 20% failed to reach normality. The length of administration and the dose influenced the results. Frequency and severity of side effects increased with the dose of Fe administered. Folate supplementation did not affect the results. It appears possible to integrate a program of prevention and treatment of Fe deficiency anemia in a primary health-care system but the constraints and limitations of achievable results should be recognized.\r"

The study looked at a number of dietary, physical, laboratory, and social variables in relation to the risk of adenomatous polyps. No significant differences were observed between subjects with and without adenomas in intake of dietary fat, proteins, or carbohydrates and in body mass index, level of physical activity, serum cholesterol, or cigarette smoking history. The only significant association was the increase in the mean number of polyps (1.04, 0.87, 1.61, and 2.34) with increasing levels of alcohol intake but the trend was not monotonic. The accrual of more subjects into the study is needed to investigate this association more thoroughly.\r"

The patients, one 48 and the other 60 years old, had acute right-flank pain and anemia; both had nephrectomy. The rings, initially believed to represent parasites (Dioctophyma renale), were from 8 to 500 micron in diameter and had uniform, pink-tan, radially striated double walls. Multiple small rings within a larger ring predominated in one case. Morphologically, the rings differed from D. renale when compared with specimens from animals infected naturally or experimentally with the giant kidney worm. Histochemical and immunoperoxidase tests for iron, calcium, mucopolysaccharides, amyloid, keratin, and hemoglobin had negative results. Energy-dispersive x-ray elemental analysis demonstrated no detectable elements; ultrastructurally, however, the rings displayed a fine fibrillary composition with a concentric and radial pattern. These rings are believed to be an end product of a phenomenon resembling or are, in fact, the Liesegang phenomenon. Because these Liesegang-like structures may be mistaken for parasites on fine-needle aspiration or surgical specimens of hemorrhagic areas, pathologists should be aware of them.\r"

The list of neoplasms that can express S-100 protein continues to expand. It has been suggested that staining for S-100 protein may be of aid in the differential diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma versus poorly differentiated tumors. Three hundred fifty primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas from various sites were immunostained for S-100 protein with the use of a commercially available polyclonal antibody. Forty-two percent of the adenocarcinomas tested expressed S-100 protein to varying degrees. The relative incidence of S-100-positive tumors varied with the primary sites, some expressing S-100 protein more often than others. A primary neoplasm able to express S-100 protein was usually associated with metastatic foci also expressing this marker. However, occasionally, a primary S-100-positive tumor was associated with metastasis that lacked expression of S-100. This study emphasizes the importance of testing for a panel of tumor markers in the evaluation of poorly differentiated tumors and cautions on possible difficulties that may arise in the interpretation of immunocytochemistry results.\r"

The histiocytes in normal tissues and the tumor cells of the histiocytic malignancies expressed these antigens in various degrees. They were not reactive with MAbs specific for lymphocytes, myeloid cells, or Reed-Sternberg cells (Ki-1 antigen). Out of these 13 MAbs, only the labeling by MAb Leu-M3, Leu-M5, anti-Monocyte 1, and RFD-7 was restricted to normal and malignant monocytes/histiocytes. In combination with their broad labeling of different types of monocytes/macrophages, these MAbs are of value in differential diagnostic purposes to distinguish histiocytic malignancies from large cell lymphomas. However, none of the 13 MAbs can be considered as pan-histiocytic reagents because they did not recognize all cell types belonging to the mononuclear/phagocytic system.\r"

Large numbers of black-stained lysosomes occurred in immature granulocytes like promyelocytes and myelocytes. In more mature granulocytes like metamyelocytes, bands, and neutrophils, substantially fewer numbers of lysosomes were detected. In leukemic myeloblasts and promyelocytes stained with basic blue 93, variable numbers of black-colored lysosomes could be detected and usually paralleled the reactions for myeloperoxidase and Sudan black B in the same cells. As an alternative to the traditional stains for myeloperoxidase, basic blue 93 has several advantages, including simplicity of use, ability to stain aged specimens, and stability of the reaction product.\r"

They demonstrate that control limits for patient specimen replicates may be derived from the long-term standard deviations (s) of commercial whole blood controls. They then use computer stimulation of the Coulter multichannel hematology instrument to determine power functions of various procedures using retained specimens. These power functions show that the use of three patient specimens and +/- 2 s limits are optimal for the detection of systematic error. They recommend that three different, previously analyzed normal range specimens be periodically analyzed, e.g., at eight-hour intervals. The differences between the current and original measurements should then be calculated and compared with their +/- 2 s limits. If at least two of the three differences for any directly measured parameter exceed the +/- 2 s limits, there will be a high probability of significant analytic error. Because the power functions of the derived red blood cell parameters, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration demonstrate relatively low error detection capabilities, the authors recommend that these parameters not be monitored with the retained patient specimen procedure.\r"

  ".W": "In the laboratory evaluation of platelet disorders, there are a number of situations in which determining the capacity of platelets to synthesize thromboxane is of diagnostic value. An assay for thromboxane production is required for the diagnosis of cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthetase defects and is useful in detecting prior aspirin ingestion. The authors describe an assay for platelet thromboxane production that is simple, rapid, inexpensive, and suitable for routine use in the clinical coagulation laboratory. It is based on platelet synthesis of 14C-thromboxane from 14C-arachidonate. 14C-thromboxane is isolated by thin-layer chromatography and its radioactivity quantitated by scintillation counting. The results are expressed as the thromboxane index: 14C-arachidonate converted to thromboxane/platelet count. The assay is linear with respect to platelet concentration and substrate concentration and is independent of recovery. Using this assay, the authors demonstrated that platelet thromboxane production, expressed as thromboxane index (mean +/- standard deviation) was completely inhibited 12-16 hours after ingestion of a single aspirin dose of 650 mg (0.27 +/- 0.14), 325 mg (0.29 +/- 0.18), or 163 mg (0.13 +/- 0.13), with partial inhibition by 81 mg (0.41 +/- 0.46) or 41 mg (1.41 +/- 0.75) (n = 3 for each dose). Thromboxane index for normal controls was 2.41 +/- 0.77 (n = 25). The authors also determined the time for recovery of thromboxane synthetic capacity to normal levels in four subjects followed longitudinally after ingesting a single 650-mg dose of aspirin. Platelets from three of the four subjects recovered normal thromboxane synthetic capacity by the fifth day after aspirin ingestion, consistent with platelet half-life in the circulation. Thus, the authors have developed a rapid, inexpensive assay for assessing the function of cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthetase in platelets, which can be especially useful as a screening test to detect ingestion of aspirin before performance of expensive and labor-intensive platelet function studies.\r"

The red blood cell life span calculated from these data (RCLSco) ranged from 81.2 to 102.9 days (mean +/- standard deviation [SD] 88.0 +/- 9.2, coefficient of variation [CV] 10.2%) for the normal subjects and 8.0-24.7 days (mean +/- SD 12.1 +/- 5.1, CV 42.1%) for those with SS. Although the individual figures for RCLSco for the normal subjects and those with SS fell within the range previously obtained by radioisotopic techniques for the respective groups, the mean values calculated from the CO technique were slightly (though not significantly) shorter for the normal subjects and about 25% shorter for the subjects with SS (P less than 0.01). Repetitive studies were performed in four subjects with SS who were clinically stable; the temporal variability in the calculated hemolytic rate differed considerably from patient to patient (CV 3.6%, 7.0%, 17.0%, 28.0%). In two patients concurrent RCLS studies were performed by the CO technique and 51Cr tagged red blood cells. In one patient, the RCLS was similar by the two techniques, in the other, a two exponent 51Cr curve did not permit calculation of RCLS. In the two patients with SC disease there was no difference in RCLSco during and after recovery from pain crisis. Although the CO technique may overestimate the turnover of circulating heme mass, especially in the presence of hemolysis, the results of serial studies in a small number of patients with SS suggest but do not prove temporal variations in hemolytic rate in SS.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to elucidate the previously observed decrease in plasma lactoferrin-neutrophil ratio in subjects with acute viral infections, a study of the neutrophil lactoferrin content in such infections was undertaken. With the use of an immunoperoxidase stain for lactoferrin, neutrophils in viral illness were shown to have reduced lactoferrin content (mean score 97.9 +/- SD [38.0] per 100 neutrophils) as compared with normal subjects (mean score 196.4 +/- SD [3.6] per 100 neutrophils) (t = 7.69; P less than 0.0005). This suggests an acquired defect of neutrophil lactoferrin synthesis in viral infection. This finding is of importance when seen against the well-recognized increased risk of bacterial superinfection in subjects who have recently had a viral infection.\r"

Recently, a latex agglutination (LA) test (Marion Laboratories) for rapid diagnosis of CAC has become available. Although early evaluations have been favorable, new evidence suggests that the LA reagent binds a soluble bacterial antigen that is not unique to toxigenic strains of C. difficile. The authors examined 201 stools received for CAC testing by LA and a reference TCA and investigated discrepant results. They obtained 29 LA(+)/TCA(+) and 155 LA(-)/TCA(-) results. Eleven patients had LA(+)/TCA(+) and 155 LA(-)/TCA(-) results. Eleven patients had LA(+)/TCA(-) results and 6 had LA(-)/TCA(+) results. The sensitivity and specificity of the LA were 83% and 93%, respectively, compared with TCA. The predictive values of positive and negative results obtained with the LA were 72% and 96%, respectively. Concentrated broth supernatants and live suspensions of three C. difficile isolates with LA(+)/TCA(-) results were tested in a rabbit ileal loop assay. All failed to demonstrate ability to produce an enterotoxin. The authors conclude that the LA method is suitable for rapid screening, but LA(+) results require confirmation by testing with other methods.\r"

Twenty-seven patients had persistent viral hepatitis (PH) and 29 patients had chronic active hepatitis (CAH) with or without cirrhosis. HBV-DNA was identified in the sera of 81% of patients with PH and 60% of patients with CAH. Significantly higher levels of HBV-DNA were found in patients with PH than in those with CAH. Both HBeAg in serum and HBcAg in liver correlated positively with serum HBV-DNA. Nine patients had serum HBV-DNA in the absence of HBeAg (four had anti-HBe), and seven of these nine patients had stainable HBcAg in the liver (two did not have staining). None of these patients had hepatic HBcAg in the absence of serum HBV-DNA. When these patients were stratified according to their epidemiologic background, serum HBV-DNA was present in a significantly higher number of male homosexuals than in any other groups. This was unrelated to their status of human immunodeficiency viral serology.\r"

The first approach, assaying direct bilirubin (DB) on all total bilirubin (TB) requests regardless of TB values, resulted in a true negative rate (normal TB level less than 1.0 mg/dL [less than 17 mumol/L], and DB level, less than 0.4 mg/dL [less than 6.8 mumol/L]) of 98.7% (984/997 specimens) and a low false negative (normal TB level, abnormal DB level) rate of 1.3% (13 of 997). The second approach, assaying DB on physician request and only if the TB level was greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/dL (1.7 mumol/L), resulted in a true negative rate (normal TB level, no liver disease) of 87.7% (150%) of 171 patients) and a relatively low false negative rate (normal TB level, liver disease) of 12.3% (21 of 171) patients. Medical chart review revealed that, with either approach, none of the patients with false negative results with hepatobiliary disease would have been missed clinically, even if the DB assay had not been done. It is possible to screen DB requests using a TB of 1.0 mg/dL (17 mumol/L) as a means to determine whether DB should be assayed.\r"

This report describes a 45-year-old man with the simultaneous occurrence of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), extramedullary large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and malignant lymphoid meningeal involvement. In this case, peripheral blood lymphocytes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphoblasts, and malignant cells in surgical biopsy tissue obtained from a soft tissue mass all stained concordantly for immunoglobulin isotypes and for B-cell immunophenotypic markers, supporting the hypothesis of a clonal origin for the three malignant cell populations. These observations suggest that the different tumors in Richter's syndrome (CLL and NHL) may represent the clonal progression of a common neoplasm rather than independent neoplastic events. Richter's syndrome and other transformations of lymphoid malignancies (prolymphocytic transformation of CLL, blast crisis of CLL, and blastic transformation of NHL) may all represent possible routes of progression in the natural history of a single neoplasm. The present case also suggests that, in patients with B-cell CLL with CNS symptoms, the possibility of blastic transformation presenting as CNS lymphoma deserves consideration.\r"

The authors report a case of PWCA (with total absence of all granulopoietic elements in the bone marrow) in a patient with metastatic spindle cell thymoma, in which suppression of autologous granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units by the patient's serum could be demonstrated. This finding suggests a humoral autoimmune mechanism for the pathogenesis of PWCA in this patient and lends support to the possibility that all hematologic phenomena associated with thymoma may have an autoimmune basis.\r"

The unencapsulated tumor measured 8 X 5 X 9.5 cm and was composed of columnar cells. Two to three mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields were present. The cells were thyroglobulin positive and not stained for calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The light microscopic appearance was similar to that of a metastasis from a carcinoma of the bowel. The authors conclude that columnar cell carcinoma is a separate type of thyroid carcinoma that shares the clinical properties of both follicular and papillary carcinoma and carries a poor prognosis. However, for practical purposes, the authors think that the tumor should be included in the category of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas together with the so-called insular carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and mucinous carcinomas.\r"

Seventeen children had a static course with cognitive deficits (seven children) or cognitive plus neurologic impairment (ten children). Neuroradiologic studies in the children with a subacute progressive or plateau course disclosed cerebral atrophy, white matter abnormalities, and calcification of the basal ganglia. Postmortem findings included variable degrees of inflammatory response, multinucleated cells, calcific vasculopathy, and pyramidal tract degeneration. Computed tomographic studies of the children with a static course were normal or showed mild atrophy, but poor brain growth was documented by serial head circumference measurements.\r"

The secondary attack rates in children 2 through 8 years of age were 61.3% (46/75) in unimmunized children, 7.5% (4/53) in children fully immunized by the filamentous hemagglutinin predominant type acellular pertussis vaccine, 14.3% (1/7) in children fully immunized by the pertussis toxin-filamentous hemagglutinin type vaccine, and 13.5% (7/52) in children given whole-cell pertussis vaccine. The estimated efficacy was 87.7% for the filamentous hemagglutinin predominant type vaccine and 76.7% for the pertussis toxin-filamentous hemagglutinin type vaccine in children aged 2 through 8 years. Both types of acellular pertussis vaccine were similarly effective, without any statistically significant differences, and their efficacy was not different from that of whole-cell vaccines. This survey also indicated that adults are a major source of infection, with a high secondary attack rate of 7.8%.\r"

Little has been reported on roentgenographic findings associated with infection caused by common viruses other than with respiratory syncytial virus. We studied chest roentgenograms from 128 previously healthy infants and children who were infected with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, or adenovirus. Four common roentgenographic findings were detected: parahilar peribronchial infiltrates, hyperexpansion, segmental or lobar atelectasis, and hilar adenopathy. Diffuse interstitial infiltrates and significant pleural fluid accumulations rarely occurred in our series. We confirmed the popular but not well-documented belief that other common respiratory viruses can be associated with roentgenographic findings similar to those caused by respiratory syncytial virus. However, respiratory syncytial virus infection is associated with more abnormal chest roentgenograms than any of the other viruses regardless of the clinical syndrome. Hilar adenopathy was more common in adenovirus infection. Young infants had significantly more abnormal chest roentgenograms, with more hyperexpansion and parahilar peribronchial infiltration than older children. We also found a significant correlation between lobar atelectasis and severity of the illness. In infants and children with viral infection of the lower respiratory tract, roentgenographic information can be a useful adjunct to clinical viral diagnosis.\r"

These findings further support the association of C3 deficiency with immune-complex disease and suggest that plasma infusion may be an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in the management of severe pyogenic infections in patients with C3 deficiency.\r"

Four months after baseline, the treated group had a significantly greater mean increase in the height z score and sexual maturation index. At 12 months, the mean increase in the sexual maturation index remained greater in the treated group. Among treated and untreated subjects older than 17 years, there was no significant difference in the absolute height z score.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether alcohol is associated with an elevated serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation in adolescents, and to determine the contribution of oral contraceptive use to these abnormalities. Adolescents (591 male and 614 female) aged 16 to 19 years, who participated in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1971 to 1973, were grouped according to their reported frequency of alcohol intake. Drinking frequency was associated with serum iron concentrations in boys and girls, and with total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin concentration in boys. Alcohol use was associated with an elevated serum iron concentration only in oral contraceptive nonusers. Adolescents who use alcohol have an elevated serum iron concentration, and male alcohol users have an increased transferrin saturation as well. These abnormalities may be precursors of hepatic iron overload and chronic liver damage.\r"

In 14 iron-deficient (serum ferritin level, less than 20 micrograms/L [less than 20 ng/L])nonanemic runners, hematologic and treadmill running values were followed up during a competitive season. Following a four-week control period, runners were treated for one month in a double-blind protocol with ferrous sulfate (975 mg/d) or placebo. During treatment, the mean ferritin level rose from 8.7 to 26.6 micrograms/L (8.7 to 26.6 ng/mL) in those patients taking iron and fell from 10.6 to 8.6 micrograms/L (10.7 to 8.6 ng/mL) in the placebo group. Treadmill endurance times improved significantly in the iron-treated runners compared with controls. Endurance time declined in all seven controls (range, 0.07 to 1.30 minutes), while six of seven iron-treated subjects improved their performance (range, 0.03 to 1.92 minutes). No significant differences in maximal or submaximal oxygen consumption, ventilation, or heart rate were observed between the groups except for a 4% increase in maximum oxygen consumption during placebo treatment. These data indicate that nonanemic iron deficiency impairs exercise performance but does not influence gas exchange or cardiac measures.\r"

Furthermore, seven of eight children with temperatures of 102 degrees F (38.9 degrees C) or greater were incorrectly identified as being afebrile. There were no false-positive fever assessments in afebrile infants.

  ".W": "Reports in the 1970s suggested that acute chest syndrome (ACS) in children with sickle cell disease is usually due to bacterial infection. Studies in adults and more recently in children, however, showed that proved bacterial infection occurs in a minority of these patients and that vascular occlusion is the main pathologic process. In a retrospective study of 32 episodes of ACS in children, a definite bacterial infection was found in 3% (one patient), possible bacterial infection in 11% (four patients), and a possible mycoplasma in 13% (five patients). With the intent to dilute sickle cells, 23 patients received blood transfusion within 24 hours after hospital admission; all showed a dramatic clinical and roentgenographic improvement. Of the nine patients who did not receive a transfusion after hospital admission, the conditions of five patients deteriorated but improved after \"late\" transfusion; three patients showed slow improvement, and only one patient improved within 48 hours. From this we conclude that vascular occlusion might be the main process in ACS and that early blood transfusion may be valuable in shortening the course and decreasing mortality. The low hemoglobin value at presentation in our patients makes dilution of sickle cells possible by packed red blood cell transfusion rather than exchange transfusion.\r"

All children received standard treatment consisting of administration of beta-adrenergic agents and theophylline compounds. Clinical asthma scores were assigned before each treatment phase and before disposition from the emergency department. Ten-day follow-up information was collected on each patient by telephone. While no differences in pretreatment CASs were found between outcome groups, disposition CASs were found to be significantly higher in patients eventually admitted to the hospital as opposed to those discharged home. However, CASs were not effective in identifying either those patients who required prolonged hospitalization (greater than 24 hours) or those who sustained ongoing disability following discharge home from the emergency department. These data indicate that the CAS alone is not a reliable indicator of severity of acute asthma of childhood as judged by subsequent disability.\r"

Evaluation of total and subscores of the abstinence syndrome showed a lower total score and a significantly lower central nervous system subscore on day 5 for infants on waterbeds. The infants on waterbeds required less medication to control symptoms. The waterbed group demonstrated a significantly earlier onset of consistent weight gain as compared with the control group. This study demonstrates that nonoscillating waterbeds are an inexpensive and effective component of supportive therapy in the care of narcotic-exposed neonates.\r"

The neonates were studied at a median postnatal age of 31 days (range, 17 to 57 days) and had median birth weights and gestational ages of 975 g (range, 570 to 1360 g) and 27.5 weeks (range, 24 to 30 weeks), respectively. Median fraction of inspiratory oxygen was 0.32 (range, 0.23 to 0.40). The sequence of study positions was randomly determined. Sleep state as well as tcPO2 and tcPCO2 were recorded every 30 s for five minutes. A significant difference in mean tcPO2 or tcPCO2 was not detected for any of the positions. Lateral positioning may facilitate the development of midline behavior in VLBW infants. Care givers are often reluctant to position infants in side lying, however, because of concerns that ventilation or oxygenation might be compromised. We conclude that placing the stable VLBW mechanically ventilated infant in a side-lying position has no deleterious effects on oxygenation and ventilation, as measured by tcPO2 and tcPCO2, and therefore should be encouraged.\r"

We compared the clinical and polysomnographic data on a series of eight patients 15 years of age or younger and an adult comparison group with narcolepsy. All patients presented with excessive daytime sleepiness, and no significant difference was found between groups for the incidence of cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. On polysomnographic evaluation the pediatric group had increased total sleep time, percent-stage 3/4 sleep, percent rapid eye movement sleep, and decreased stage 1 sleep, which all are expected age-related differences. The pediatric group also showed a greater degree of daytime sleepiness and an increased frequency of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods. While pediatric patients with narcolepsy resemble adults in their mode of presentation and the incidence of accessory symptoms, the increase in severity of sleepiness highlights the importance of diagnosing narcolepsy in children as early as possible so that treatment can be initiated.\r"

Also, breast-feedings and umbilical cord care were studied. Except for cesarean section deliveries, study infants were similar to all infants (N = 1474) admitted to the same nursery during the study period. Cord separation occurred from days three to 45, with a mean of 13.9 days. Infants born by cesarean section were found to have an increased interval for cord separation when compared with infants born vaginally (mean +/- SD, 15.9 +/- 5.0 days vs 12.9 +/- 4.2 days). In this study, delays in separation of the umbilical cord beyond 3 weeks of age was not associated with an increased risk of infection.\r"

Regression analyses indicated that mothers of infants on monitors experienced less perceived stress when they received greater support. Mothers of infants on monitors who experienced less stress reported greater general life satisfaction and greater satisfaction with parenting.\r"

Because of low specificity, primary care physicians are faced with an abundance of false-positive results that challenge the interpreting physician with clinical, economic, and medicolegal considerations. We surveyed 154 physicians caring for Wisconsin-born infants with the highest newborn-screen thyrotropin values in a two-year period. Our results indicated that (1) confirmation of thyroid normalcy is often delayed beyond 6 weeks of age; (2) there is wide variation among physicians regarding therapeutic goals if hypothyroidism is confirmed; and (3) physicians prefer autonomy in the management of congenital hypothyroidism. Modifications in hypothyroid screening programs may include confirmatory tests by a central laboratory (that distributes filter paper with all abnormal results), provision of a management decision tree for primary care physicians, and a one-time subsidy for a visit to a pediatric endocrinologist. We suggest that these modifications may improve the long-term outcome of hypothyroid infants identified by the screening program.\r"

Mean serum levels of retinol, retinol-binding protein, prealbumin, and zinc were significantly lower in the children with SCD than in normal children. Mean serum retinol and prealbumin levels were similar in the GR and GN sickle cell groups. Mean serum retinol-binding protein levels were lower in GR than in GN patients. Serum zinc levels, somatomedin C levels, and bone age were frequently abnormal in the patients with SCD, but these factors did not correlate with growth status. It was not possible to explain the poor growth in patients with SCD in this study solely on the basis of nutritional factors.\r"

The rectal biopsy is particularly important in establishing the diagnosis of Crohn's disease when the rectal mucosa is grossly normal. The sigmoidoscopy and biopsy serve to assess the response to medical therapy in inflammatory bowel disease and are important adjuncts to colonoscopy in surveillance for dysplasia and carcinoma in patients with ulcerative colitis. Sigmoidoscopy is quick, requires no preparation, is cost effective, and the biopsies are extremely safe with the use of the cupped bronchoscopic forceps.\r"

The number of polyps was evenly distributed throughout the colon. Proximally, neoplastic polyps predominated, accounting for 73% of all polyps in the right colon. This was reversed in the distal colon where non-neoplastic polyps comprised 65% of all polyps in the rectum. The incidence of carcinoma was extremely low in small colon polyps, 0.1%. All polyps should be removed when encountered during colonoscopy due to the high prevalence of adenomas among small colon polyps.\r"

We evaluated 302 patients 65 yr old or older, to determine the incidence of complications. We found that the risk is comparable to that of the heterogeneous patient population previously reported, except for a slightly increased incidence of delayed bleeding subsequent to polypectomy. In addition, the presence of cardiac, pulmonary, liver, or kidney disease was not found to be associated with an increased incidence of complications. Neither was there an increased risk of complications in patients undergoing colonoscopy, who had previously undergone abdominal or pelvic surgery. In summary, older patients experience the same risks as younger patients, except for post-polypectomy delayed bleeding, which may be related to atherosclerosis of the blood vessels, and appears to be more common in elderly patients.\r"

We report further studies in various clinical settings having normogastrinemia (normal, n = 17; unoperated duodenal ulcer, n = 13; primary hyperparathyroidism, n = 7) and hypergastrinemia (postvagotomy, n = 5; hypochlorhydria, n = 7; achlorhydria, n = 10; chronic renal failure, n = 10; gastrinoma, n = 5). Under all nongastrinoma conditions, there were similar gastrin rises of 9-19% between 2 and 5 min after bolus intravenous GIH secretin (2 CU/kg), which fell to baseline by 8 min, except for chronic renal failure. In chronic renal failure, gastrin remained elevated from 7 to 30 min and was significantly different (p less than 0.05) at 10-30 min compared to all other nongastrinoma conditions except hyperparathyroidism. Peak rises occurred within 5 min in all entities, but only three gastrinoma patients had positive secretin provocation tests by the predefined criterion of a gastrin rise greater than 200 pg/ml. The results of secretin provocation in various clinical entities with and without hypergastrinemia further support the hypothesis that the gastrin rise in gastrinoma is an exaggeration of the normal response. The prolonged gastrin rise seen in chronic renal failure may be due to altered renal clearance, inasmuch as other hypergastrinemic states had responses similar to normal and duodenal ulcer.\r"

Under basal conditions, progressively lower median pH values were detected in ADU and IDU patients, compared with controls. A significant difference was found between C and ADU during daytime (1.38 vs. 0.85), nighttime (1.29 vs. 0.81), and 24 h (1.35 vs. 0.81) and between C and IDU during 24 h (1.35 vs. 1.11). However, no statistical difference was observed between patients with active and inactive ulcer disease. Administration of ranitidine and cimetidine significantly increased gastric pH during nighttime but not during daytime. Ranitidine, at the doses studied, proved to be more potent than cimetidine in suppressing gastric acidity. Gastric pH was unaffected by pirenzepine in most cases.\r"

A postmortem liver biopsy demonstrated necrosis, fibrosis, hyalin, and phospholipid-laden lysosomal lamellar bodies. Resolution of hepatic dysfunction may not necessarily occur on withdrawal of amiodarone if irreversible damage is already established. We speculate as to the reasons for the reportedly low incidence of overt liver disease, and suggest that hepatic enzyme levels, as well as other indicators of hepatic function, such as the serum albumin concentration, be monitored indefinitely in all patients while taking amiodarone.\r"

We discontinued treatment after 20 h, since the stone residue showed no change. Cholecystoscopy performed with an Edwards angioscope via a catheter showed that there were no stone remnants, but that there were flat polyps on the gallbladder wall. One hour later, we stopped the therapy. Cholecystoscopy is a useful method of assessing the results of MTBE treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Double lumen subclavian venous hemodialysis catheters are in wide use in the United States to provide temporary vascular access. The disadvantages of these catheters include a high infection rate and short use-life (2 to 3 weeks). We evaluated a felt cuffed tunnelled jugular venous hemodialysis catheter (PermCath) to determine its ability to overcome these shortcomings and compared it with standard noncuffed double lumen dialysis catheters. Eighty PermCaths were inserted during this prospective study in patients needing temporary vascular access in excess of 1 month. Median use-life of these catheters was 8 weeks with a use range of 3 weeks to 5.4 months. Only four functioning catheters failed before elective removal. Despite the prolonged use-life there was only one episode of catheter mediated bacteremia. Seven catheters (9%) failed to function immediately after insertion. These failures were caused by catheter kinking in the region of the felt cuff. Thrombosis of the catheter lumen was the most frequent complication (137 episodes) but resolved in over 95% of the instances with urokinase instillation. Exit site infections (23 instances) were successfully treated conservatively. We conclude that the PermCath (Quinton Instrument Co, Seattle) is a safe and reliable new device with a low complication rate and a longer use-life than standard subclavian dialysis catheters. This longer use-life allows more time for maturation of primary arteriovenous (AV) fistulas and Tenckhoff peritoneal dialysis catheters, and provides time for the healing of infected vascular access grafts. Its primary disadvantage is the need for surgical insertion.\r"

Serum lipids, platelet aggregation studies, and template bleeding times were determined before and after 4 weeks of fish oil treatment. The lipid studies were repeated approximately 20 weeks after stopping fish oil supplement. At the end of the treatment period, serum triglycerides (mean +/- SEM) decreased from 297 +/- 42 to 211 +/- 29 mg/dL (P less than .01), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol fell from 45 +/- 3 to 41 +/- 3 mg/dL (P less than .05), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased from 172 +/- 16 to 208 +/- 19 mg/dL (P less than .05). After discontinuing the fish oil supplement, the triglycerides increased to 278 +/- 39 mg/dL, which was no different than the value before fish oil treatment. No significant changes occurred in template bleeding time (TBT), platelet count, hematocrit, or platelet aggregation response. Clinically important uremic bleeding was not apparent. We conclude that in CAPD patients a fish oil supplement favorably effects hypertriglyceridemia and can be ingested without promoting uremic bleeding. The likely beneficial impact on atherogenesis resulting from the lowering of the triglycerides may, however, be counteracted by concomitant changes in HDL- and LDL-cholesterol.\r"

Most developed peritoneal eosinophilia within 3 months of the initiation of dialysis, although the phenomenon could occur as early as one day or as late as 6 months after dialysis. Fifty-seven percent of those with peritoneal eosinophilia also had peripheral blood eosinophilia. Although most peritoneal eosinophilic episodes subsided in a month, in one patient the process grumbled on for 150 days. The number of peritonitis episodes was not significantly different between patients with peritoneal eosinophilia and those without. The only distinction between the two groups of patients was that those who developed peritoneal eosinophilia had a significantly (P = .002) higher serum IgE concentration initially as well as throughout the period of observation.\r"

We analyzed the parental origin and stage of meiotic errors resulting in trisomy 21 in each of five families by successfully using cytogenetic heteromorphisms and DNA polymorphisms. The 16 DNA fragments used to detect polymorphisms spanned the length of the long arm and detected recombinational events on nondisjoined chromosomes in both maternal meiosis I and maternal meiosis II errors. The meiotic stage at which errors occurred was determined by sandwiching the centromere between cytogenetic heteromorphisms on 21p and an informative haplotype constructed using two polymorphic DNA probes that map to 21q just below the centromere. This study illustrates the necessity of combining cytogenetic polymorphisms on 21p with DNA polymorphisms spanning 21q to determine (1) the source and stage of meiotic errors that lead to trisomy 21 and (2) whether an association exists between nondisjunction and meiotic recombination.\r"

In 65 families for which there were complete data on sibship size, there was recurrence of the OI type II phenotype in five families such that six (8.6%) of 70 sibs were affected. In two families with recurrence, the radiographic phenotype was milder than that for the remainder; and one of those families was consanguinous, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. In the remaining three families there was no evidence of consanguinity, but in one of them the structure was compatible with gonadal mosaicism in the mother. In studies of collagens synthesized by cells from 43 infants, we identified two probands with separate rearrangements in an allele of one of the genes of type I collagen; but in the rest there were subtle mutations that disrupted the normal triple-helix structure of type I collagen molecules. In two probands we identified de novo mutations; in 16 additional families cells from the parents made only normal collagens, compatible with new mutations in their offsprings. These findings indicate that the OI type II phenotype is biochemically heterogeneous, that the majority result from new dominant mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen, and that some recurrences can be accounted for by gonadal mosaicism in one of the parents.\r"

The results are consistent with the presence of a recessive or codominant major gene controlling susceptibility to leprosy per se and nonlepromatous leprosy, respectively. Under the major-gene model, tests of homogeneity to check for internal consistency of the sample and to compare subsamples according to an epidemiological criterion, the place of residence of the probands, were conducted; results of none of these tests were significant. However, we have noted that information on 3 generations (nuclear families with a pointer to the sibship) is of major importance for detecting major gene(s). Besides, the discrepancy in the results obtained in separate analyses of the family subsamples defined by the place of residence of the probands is discussed in terms of possible genetic and/or environmental differences. Referring to experimental data and previous studies, we suggest that the gene for susceptibility to leprosy per se and that for susceptibility to nonlepromatous leprosy might be different, acting at successive stages of the immune response to infection with Mycobacterium leprae.\r"

This rate was higher in the group of unexplained fertilization failure (22.5%) than in the group of fertilization failure due to sperm deficiency (10.2%).

The functional DHFR gene is on chromosome 5, and DHFRP4 is on chromosome 3. Using in situ hybridization, we have now localized the functional DHFR gene to the region q11.1-q13.3 on chromosome 5. By genomic DNA analysis of a panel of human X rodent somatic-cell hybrids, we determined the chromosomal assignment of the DHFRP1 pseudogene to chromosome 18 and that of the DHFRP2 pseudogene to chromosome 6. The DHFRP1 pseudogene exhibits a novel form of polymorphism in humans in that it is present in the DNA of some individuals and absent in that of others. We investigated the racial distribution of this pseudogene in five racial groups. The allelic frequency as defined by analysis of 180 chromosomes was found to be 94% in Mediterraneans, 77% in Asian Indians, 67% in Chinese, 57% in Southeast Asians, and 32% in American blacks. These data suggest that the transposition of this \"perfect\" pseudogene occurred prior to the inception of the human racial groups.\r"

It is a likelihood-ratio test based on a beta distribution for the prior distribution of the recombination fraction among families (or individuals). The null distribution for this statistic (called the B-test) is derived under a broad range of circumstances. Two other heterogeneity test statistics--the admixture test or A-test first described by Smith and Morton's test (here referred to as the K-test)--are also examined. The probability distribution for the K-test statistic is very sensitive to family size, whereas the other two statistics are not. All three statistics are somewhat sensitive to the magnitude of the recombination fraction theta. Critical values for each of the test statistics are given. A conservative approximation for both the A-test and B-test is given by a chi 2 distribution when P/2 instead of P is used for the observed significance level. In terms of power, the B-test performs best among the three tests over a broad range of alternate heterogeneity hypotheses--except for the specific case of admixture with loose linkage, in which the A-test performs best. Overall, the difference in power among the three tests is not large. An application to some recently published data on the fragile-X syndrome and X-chromosome markers is given.\r"

We have defined six RFLPs for OAT, to explore its possible role in gyrate atrophy (GA) of the choroid and retina, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder associated with a deficiency of OAT activity. The RFLPs, which are detected by noncoding single-copy probes from the OAT gene and by subclones of the HOAT1 cDNA, all map on human chromosome 10, producing an overall level of heterozygosity for the OAT locus of 83%. Using the RFLPs, we have determined that the OAT locus segregates concordantly with GA in one available pedigree. Furthermore, the RFLPs display significant disequilibrium with GA, providing genetic evidence implicating a defect in the OAT structural gene as the cause of this disorder. The RFLPs for OAT are potentially applicable to prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection in families with a previous history of GA. They will also allow identification of specific haplotypes associated with GA chromosomes, as a guide for more detailed molecular-genetic investigations of the mutations underlying the disorder.\r"

The influence of treatment with indapamide was evaluated. In normotensive rats, hemodynamic values remained unchanged during the 10 minutes following the carotid ligation. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, arterial pressure values immediately and significantly (p less than 0.01) increased, up to 50 percent during the 10 minutes following the carotid ligation. Heart rate was unchanged. Indapamide at a short-term 3 mg/kg intraperitoneally, chosen in order to give a minimal (nonsignificant) antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats, significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced the bilateral carotid ligation-induced vasopressor response, whereas heart rate remained unchanged. The results presented here show that in spontaneously hypertensive rats, but not in normotensive rats, bilateral common carotid ligation induces an immediate and strong increase in arterial pressure values. These results compare with the previously described differences in cerebral ischemia-induced disorders in normotensive and hypertensive rats. Finally, indapamide, an antihypertensive agent that decreases vascular reactivity, significantly inhibits the carotid ligation-induced vasopressive response in hypertensive rats.\r"

  ".W": "This study analyzed the variation in the parameters characterizing the quality of life and well-being of hypertensive patients treated with indapamide. Thirty patients (10 men and 20 women; mean age, 52.5 +/- 2.1 years, SEM) were selected after a three-week observation period during which patients received placebo. They all had essential hypertension, defined as a diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 120 mm Hg. After the three-week placebo treatment period, indapamide was prescribed as single-agent therapy at a dose of one tablet per day (2.5 mg) for three months. The quality of life and the feeling of well-being of the treated subjects were analyzed on the basis of two self-assessment scales completed by patients and on the responses to a clinical observation scale completed during the consultation by the doctor. The decrease in blood pressure was significant (p less than 0.01) by the first month of treatment and the blood pressure was controlled (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) in 79.3 percent of patients by the third month. Statistical analysis of the modifications in the different scores demonstrated a significant improvement between the start and the end of the indapamide treatment period for the three types of scales (p less than 0.01). Analysis of the results also confirmed the homogeneous and significant concordance between the improvement in the responses to the doctor and patient scales. These results on the improvement in quality of life and well-being observed with indapamide demonstrate the importance of taking these aspects into consideration in the drug treatment for permanent essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The cardiac prognosis of hypertensive patients has been able to be precisely determined over the last 20 years as a result of large-scale epidemiologic surveys. The incidence of ischemic heart disease and the importance of left ventricular hypertrophy have been clearly defined in the literature. In contrast, the incidence of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias has been poorly taken into account, although hypertension increases the risk of sudden death to the same degree as coronary artery disease. The relative risk increases progressively as a function of the quintiles of distribution of blood pressure, reaching a value of 3.2 for the highest quintile. There is also a significant correlation between hypertension and ventricular arrhythmias. Hypertensive subjects with other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia or smoking and with ventricular extrasystoles, reflecting the presence of silent ischemia, can be considered to be at high risk of cardiac death.\r"

Six patients--five with normal renal function--were classified as nonresponders (decrease in diastolic blood pressure less than 5 mm Hg). The remaining nine patients had dose-related decreases in blood pressure. Patients with or without renal failure showed similar decreases in blood pressure. Blood pressure reduction was associated with a significant decrease in cardiac index in the responders at the highest dose, related to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and stroke volume, whereas heart rate did not increase. This apparent decrease in venous return was associated with a significant decrease in body weight but not plasma volume in the responders. Indapamide did not change plasma norepinephrine levels, but decreased pressor responsiveness to exogenous norepinephrine. Responders had lower initial plasma renin activity and a smaller absolute increase in plasma renin activity while receiving indapamide, whereas angiotensin II pressor responsiveness was decreased more. The results presented indicate that the blood pressure lowering effect of indapamide in the present patient population is observed with or without renal failure and is associated with a decrease in pressor reactivity. In nonresponders, compensatory mechanisms (e.g., renin) may negate the antihypertensive effect of indapamide.\r"

  ".W": "Diuretic therapy is still regarded as the first-step approach in elderly patients with benign or moderate arterial hypertension. Traditional preparations such as thiazides, or potassium-sparing agents, are not devoid of significant side effects, however. Indapamide, a nonthiazide diuretic, has been shown to reduce blood pressure at low doses, in several clinical reports. In the present study, the effect of indapamide (2.5 mg per day) was compared with that of hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg per day) on blood pressure and serum chemistry of 47 elderly hypertensive patients (ages 65 to 91). After a six-week placebo-treatment period, patients were randomly assigned to receive either indapamide or hydrochlorothiazide. At that moment, blood pressure of patients in the supine position averaged 185 +/- 2/107 +/- 2, and 181 +/- 3/102 +/- 2 mm Hg, in the indapamide and hydrochlorothiazide groups, respectively. After 48 weeks of therapy, blood pressure was 162 +/- 3/89 +/- 2 and 170 +/- 2/94 +/- 2 mm Hg in the same groups, respectively. Serum sodium levels remained unchanged in indapamide-treated patients, but decreased progressively from 141 +/- 1 to 134 +/- 1 meq/liter in hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. Serum potassium levels decreased from 4.50 +/- 0.12 to 4.04 +/- 0.10 meq/liter in indapamide-treated patients, whereas in the patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide, kalemia decreased from 4.23 +/- 0.09 to 3.33 +/- 0.01 meq/liter. Finally, serum uric acid levels did not increase significantly in patients receiving indapamide, whereas it rose from 6.5 +/- 0.4 to 8.7 +/- 0.3 mg/dl in patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide. In conclusion, indapamide resulted in a better control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in this group of elderly hypertensive patients. In addition, the effect of each drug on blood chemistry differed markedly: indapamide failed to alter significantly the serum ionic composition, whereas hydrochlorothiazide was associated with both hyponatremia and hypokalemia.\r"

This study was performed to compare progesterone profiles in women with luteal phase defect with those of women with normal cycles and to establish a discriminatory level of serum progesterone that may aid in the diagnosis of this condition. Compared with patients with luteal phase defect cycles, women with normal cycles produced significantly more progesterone in the luteal phase. The serum progesterone level (less than or equal to 21 nmol/L) was the optimal discriminatory level between luteal phase defect and normal cycles and provided a diagnostic test with 70% sensitivity and 71% specificity. In women with recurrent abortion, the incidence of luteal phase defect was 40%, but with treatment 81% of pregnancies were successful. The findings in this study support the existence of luteal phase defect as a clinically significant entity in recurrent first-trimester spontaneous abortion and one that can be treated successfully with the administration of progesterone. The histologic diagnosis of luteal phase defect may also be confirmed with serum progesterone.\r"

All but three patients had general anesthesia for the purpose of treatment. Tissue destruction was accomplished to a depth of 2 to 3 mm. Patients were followed up for an average of 14.4 months with regular colposcopy, cytologic evaluation, and biopsy when persistent or recurrent disease was suspected. Failure of therapy was defined as evidence of intraepithelial neoplasia in any one of these three parameters. Four patients required a second treatment. After one or two treatments the success rate of therapy was 78%. In our institution, laser vaporization with the patient under general anesthesia on an outpatient basis is the treatment of choice for vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia.\r"

In this study each of these factors was evaluated based only on the findings available before surgery, and the observations are compared with patient survival and incidence of node metastases. One hundred consecutive patients with stage IB or IIA cervical cancer treated by primary radical surgery and followed at least 2 years are reported. Disease-free survival was 90% at 2 years and 85% at 5 years; 19% had node metastases. Of the factors studied, only age greater than 50 years was associated with poor prognosis (p less than 0.02 versus age less than 50 years). Only large tumor size was associated with increased node metastases (p less than 0.001 versus medium and small size). Tumor cell type, differentiation, and channel involvement had no bearing on survival or node metastases. Because older age and large tumors appear to be factors of poor prognosis for surgery, and yet it is not clear that these patients fare better with radiotherapy, we suggest a prospective trial of radiotherapy versus surgery for this group.\r"

Of all primary cesarean sections, about half are due to dystocia. This is largely confined to nulliparous women. Work from Ireland suggests that a policy of active management of labor may reduce dystocia. This involves a uniform policy of amniotomy once a diagnosis of labor is established, followed by oxytocin augmentation if labor is nonprogressive (less than 1 cm/hr). From October 1, 1985, to December 31, 1986, this policy was carried out on 552 consecutive normal nulliparous women in spontaneous labor at greater than or equal to 37 weeks' gestation with a single fetus in vertex presentation with no fetal distress. These results were compared with a control group of 533 similar nulliparous women delivered between January 1, 1984 and March 31, 1985. The cesarean section rate dropped to 4.3% from 13% (p less than 0.005) and the forceps delivery rate dropped to 19.4% from 29% (p less than 0.005).

Review of 674 perinatal deaths at 37 plus weeks in Quebec showed no increase in deaths postterm. The increase in fetal distress and meconium aspiration postterm without an increase in birth asphyxia or fetal death may reflect greater responsiveness of the more mature fetus to mild asphyxic insults. Findings of this study could not justify increased fetal monitoring in postdate pregnancies.\r"

Its exact role in fetal cardiac diagnosis has not been established. We examined 67 high-risk fetuses for cardiac malformations and found cardiac abnormalities or malfunction in 15. In four fetuses pulsed Doppler echocardiography played a primary or a definitive diagnostic role: One fetus had a complete atrioventricular canal, another lacked the pulmonary valve, the third had transposition of the great vessels without ventricular septal defect, and the fourth had high cardiac output failure caused by placental chorioangioma. Pulsed Doppler echocardiography is an integral part of the ultrasonic cardiac examination in high-risk fetuses and should be used in combination with two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography. It has an important place in the diagnosis of high-risk fetuses and may have a primary role in the diagnosis of fetuses when ultrasound resolution is poor, where cardiac circulatory hemodynamics are essential for diagnosis, and in complicated cardiac malformations in which a comprehensive and accurate diagnosis can be achieved only with pulsed Doppler echocardiography.\r"

The trend for the median number of maternally perceived fetal movements in the 2-hour observation period, across gestation, was similar to that previously reported in both maternally perceived and ultrasound studies. The median number of perceived fetal movements in any 15-minute interval was similar for both groups and was constant over gestational age. The periodicity of fetal activity perceived by mothers correlated well with ultrasonic observations. The data support that fetal movement counts are very variable. Periodicity must be taken into account when maternally perceived fetal activity is used as a screen of fetal well-being. The data suggest that the patient should be observed for a consecutive period, up to a maximum of 2 hours. If no fetal activity is perceived by 2 consecutive hours of observation, then further evaluation of fetal well-being should be considered.\r"

Twenty-two patients developed persistent or recurrent disease. Only one of these is now alive with no evidence of tumor. The mean interval from diagnosis to recurrence was 8.7 months (median of 7.0) and from diagnosis to death was 14.7 months (median of 12.0). Eleven of 32 patients with Stage IB disease developed a recurrence; the intervals to recurrence in Stage IB disease were similar to those for more advanced stages. Factors predicting recurrence included advanced stage of the disease and tumor bulk (maximum size, depth of invasion, and number of involved quadrants) as well as an exophytic or ulcerative tumor and a symptomatic presentation. These factors may identify the patient at high risk for recurrence who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.\r"

The objective of this study was to investigate further the effect of 8-bromo-cAMP on the conversion of C19 androgens to estradiol by placental cells. Trophoblast cells were prepared from human term placenta and maintained in monolayer culture. On days 3 and 4 of culture, these cells were treated with dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, or testosterone with or without the concomitant presence of 8-Br-cAMP. 8-Br-cAMP markedly enhanced human chorionic gonadotropin secretion into the culture medium. On the other hand, the concomitant addition of 8-Br-cAMP with the androgen precursors led to an inhibition of estradiol output. The concentrations of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone in the culture medium after treatment with dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were elevated by the concomitant presence of 8-Br-cAMP. From these results we conclude that 8-Br-cAMP enhances human chorionic gonadotropin output in human term placental cells, whereas the presence of 8-Br-cAMP in cells given androgen precursors inhibits estradiol output, probably at the level of aromatization.\r"

  ".W": "Viral complement fixation tests on women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss were complicated by the presence of anticomplementary activity. This activity reflects the presence of a factor(s) in a patient's serum that nonspecifically fixes complement. When all patient sera tested were compared, 64.7% of women with recurrent pregnancy loss had anticomplementary activity compared with 22.0% among normal fertile pregnant women (p less than 0.01). In delineating when anticomplementary activity developed, it was found that 41.8% of women with recurrent pregnancy loss compared with 12.9% of normal pregnant women had this activity on entry to the study (p less than 0.01). This was primarily due to the fact that among women with recurrent pregnancy loss 50.0% of the pregnant versus 33.0% of the nonpregnant women had activity (NS). However, 55.2% of the anticomplementary negative women with recurrent pregnancy loss converted to a positive status compared with 15.4% of normal women (p less than 0.05). This was directly influenced by a conversion rate of 78.6% during pregnancy among women with recurrent pregnancy loss who entered the study nonpregnant and with no known cause for loss compared with a 33.3% conversion rate in their pregnant counterparts with recurrent pregnancy loss (p less than 0.025). Conversion to positive anticomplementary status occurred primarily by 20 weeks of gestation and appeared to be transient. Overall there was no association between the presence of anticomplementary activity and cervical colonization with genital mycoplasmas. The data suggest that women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss develop a serum factor(s), usually by 20 weeks' gestation, that fixes complement. Thus these observations describe an additional anomaly in the immune system of women who experience recurrent pregnancy loss.\r"

Rabbit fetuses of either 28 or 30 gestational days were treated with isoxsuprine. Fetuses from half of the does in each group were removed and allowed to breathe for 30 minutes. The others were left in utero. Intracellular and extracellular surfactant pools were isolated. Breathing increased secreted surfactant. On the twenty-eighth day without breathing, isoxsuprine treatment increased secretion of surfactant. The reverse effect was noted in the group that received the drug and also breathed. In contrast, on the thirtieth day, the drug inhibited surfactant release in those fetuses that did not breathe. In in vitro studies, undifferentiated type II alveolar cells were isolated and stimulated to differentiate. Subsequent exposure to isoxsuprine (5 or 10 mumol/L) stimulated both the synthesis and secretion of radiolabeled disaturated phosphatidylcholine. Concurrent incubation of those cells exposed to 10 mumol/L isoxsuprine with either unsaturated or disaturated phosphatidylcholine that was carbon 14 labeled showed a strong preference for incorporation of the latter phospholipid into total cellular phosphatidylcholine. These results suggest that beta-adrenergics may inhibit as well as stimulate secretion of surfactant by type II alveolar cells and that these cells may reincorporate secreted disaturated phospholipid.\r"

Comparison of grandmultiparous mothers with all others revealed no increase in the incidence of hypertension, diabetes, uterine atonia, antenatal or postnatal hemorrhage, cesarean sections, stillbirth rate, or congenital malformations. The grandmultipara had significantly lower neonatal mortality and low birth weight rates and a significantly higher incidence of multiple births and trisomy 21 (p less than 0.01). These results strongly suggest that grandmultiparity in and of itself in a healthy, economically stable population afforded modern medical care is not a major risk factor and that previous reports primarily reflected social class factors and not parity per se.\r"

This marked discrepancy from the data found in the pediatric literature may relate to nonviable fetuses identified in utero, who escape pediatric case identification.

Women who died of general anesthesia complications did not differ by age, presence of preexisting medical conditions, or type of facility from women who died of other causes. However, the proportion of deaths from general anesthesia complications was significantly higher among women of black and other races, women obtaining abortions during the first trimester, and women obtaining abortions in the Northeast. Our results indicate that at least 23 of the 27 deaths were due to hypoventilation and/or loss of airway resulting in hypoxia.

The postpartum median maternal platelet-bindable IgG was 333 molecules per platelet and for colostrum it was 297 molecules per platelet.

We used a newly developed delivery system and special contact masks to deliver the 193-nm excimer light. Astigmatic corrections of up to 4.16 diopters were obtained. The actual corrections corresponded well with the intended values as predicted by a biomechanical theory. The refractive change over time was different than that observed after knife incisions, suggesting different repair mechanisms. An epithelial plug filling the whole T-excision persisted for over one year in all eyes.\r"

Retinal regions with, and those without, ophthalmoscopic signs of degeneration were investigated. During dark adaptation, the time courses of rhodopsin regeneration and recovery of scotopic sensitivity were similar to normal as was the relation of rhodopsin to scotopic threshold. In dark-adapted eyes, threshold increases were not proportional to rhodopsin loss. The results of psychophysical tests of background adaptation and temporal summation, and analysis of the relation of electroretinographic a- to b-wave amplitudes, led to the conclusion that abnormalities of photoreceptor cell function central to the rhodopsin-bearing outer segments accounted for the increased thresholds.\r"

In a subsequent trial of 12 untreated ocular hypertensive subjects, the duration of action was determined using the same dose and method of delivery. Results showed that verapamil elicited a mean +/- S.E.M. change in intraocular pressure of -3.8 +/- 0.900 mm Hg in the treated eye, and -1.6 +/- 0.400 mm Hg in the untreated eye. This reduction was statistically different in both eyes (treated eye, P = .0007; untreated eye, P = .005). This decrease in intraocular pressure remained statistically significant when compared to predrug baseline values for up to ten hours.\r"

Based on univariate analysis, presence of preoperative nuclear sclerosis, length of follow-up period, and surgeon were found to be associated with the occurrence or progression of nuclear sclerosis. Differences between surgeons were largely accounted for by the difference in proportions with preoperative nuclear sclerosis, and differing lengths of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier life table analysis performed on 53 eyes with examination of fellow eyes and longer follow-up showed significantly more nuclear sclerosis in the operated on eye when compared to the fellow eye (log-rank test, P less than .0001).\r"

The membranes consisted of a core of collagen of various diameter fibers usually covered on both sides by cells that displayed glial cell characteristics. The retina reattached spontaneously and exudates disappeared when traction was eliminated by vitreous surgery. Membrane formation did reoccur after vitrectomy if the vessels continued to leak, leading again to traction and subretinal exudation. Treatment consisted of surgical removal of vitreal and preretinal membranes and destruction of leaking vessels.\r"

Reactivity of these antibodies with KS was compared with the reactivity of other known endothelial markers (F8rAg, Ia, HCL-1). Staining was done with avidin-biotin-alkaline phosphatase immunohistochemistry on acetone-fixed frozen sections. In all samples of tumor both the spindle cell component and the vascular lining cells stained with both B721 and E431. In general, the spindle cells stained less intensely than did the vascular lining cells. There was both intratumor and intertumor variability. B721 and E431 are proposed as two additional markers for KS, and it is suggested that their reactivity with the tumor supports the hypothesis that KS is derived from vascular endothelium. The possibility is also raised that the variability of staining for vascular markers could have diagnostic possibilities, and further studies for investigation of this hypothesis are suggested.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the cytoplasmic part and to the extracellular main immunogenic region (MIR) of the alpha subunit of AChRs were used. Their intrathymic binding sites were defined by double-immunostaining, and compared with alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-Bgt) labeling demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. Tumor-free thymuses of MG patients and control patients contained cytoplasmic AChR epitopes and alpha-Bgt binding sites on myoid cells and some epithelial cells. Only myoid cells also expressed extracellular MIR epitopes, suggesting that they bear complete AChRs, and are important targets for the autoimmune attack in tumor-free MG thymus. Evidence that AChR-related antigenic determinants of epithelial cells are also significant for MG is provided by our findings in thymic epithelial tumors. All eight tumors with MG but only two out of six tumors without MG showed cytoplasmic AChR epitopes and alpha-Bgt binding sites on neoplastic epithelial cells. Myoid cells and MIR epitopes did not occur in the neoplasms, but in some tumor-free thymic remnants beside thymomas. It is assumed that nonneoplastic and neoplastic thymic epithelial cells contain only incomplete AChRs or AChR-like molecules. The different expression of AChR epitopes in thymic epithelial tumors and tumor-free thymuses might explain some of the heterogeneous region specificities of anti-AChR antibodies in sera of MG patients with and without thymoma.\r"

Western blotting analyses showed both chromogranin A and secretogranin I in normal adrenals, pheochromocytomas, a pituitary adenoma, and in normal pituitary glands, but not in a bladder carcinoma. Rat adrenal medullary and anterior pituitary tissues reacted with the polyclonal chromogranin A and secretogranin I antisera, but not with the two monoclonal chromogranin A antibodies. All antibodies reacted with most of the neuroendocrine cells and tumors examined. Pituitary prolactinomas contained immunoreactive secretogranin I, but not chromogranin A. Analysis of the distribution of chromogranin A and secretogranin I in pancreatic islet cells showed that chromogranin A was found predominantly in the glucagon-producing A cells, whereas secretogranin I was present in less than 5% of islet cells. These results indicate that chromogranin A and secretogranin I are both useful in the characterization of some neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms.\r"

The antigen was localized in paraffin sections of 167/178 (94%) Bouin's-fixed human breast carcinoma tissues and few other carcinomas (1/8 lung [squamous], 4/4 uterine cervix) in an intracellular pattern, whereas an apical or glycocalyx distribution was seen in several normal tissues, benign lesions, and malignant tumors. Although the immunocytochemical staining patterns observed with these antibodies have many similarities to those described with other previously reported monoclonal antibodies, notable differences include the lack of reactivity of CU18, CU26, and CU46 with lactating mammary gland and with gastrointestinal malignancies. BCA-225 binds to wheat germ lectin, not to concanavalin A, but monoclonal antibody binding does not appear to involve the carbohydrate component of the molecule. The frequency of the immunocytochemical detection of BCA-225 in breast carcinomas and its restricted distribution in other human tissues suggest considerable clinical potential for this antigen and its corresponding monoclonal antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin E and selenium (E-Se) deficiency causes necrosis of the contractile myocardium in many species but does not usually affect the cells of the conduction system. In the present study, experimental E-Se deficiency in cattle produced preferential degeneration and necrosis of Purkinje cardiocytes. Calves fed deficient diets for 127-137 days had sublethal damage characterized histologically by sarcoplasmic accumulation of lipopigment granules; ultrastructurally, these granules corresponded to cytolysosomes that had a heterogeneous ultrastructure. Alterations in necrotic cells included mitochondrial mineralization, sarcoplasmic condensation, and plasmalemmal fragmentation. Necrosis of Purkinje cells was followed by macrophagic penetration of the external lamina, phagocytosis of necrotic sarcoplasm, and repair by fibrosis. Furthermore, E-Se depletion of calves resulted in only minimal alterations in the contractile myocardium. In contrast, feeding supplements of polyunsaturated fatty acids to E-Se-deficient calves intensified the Purkinje cell damage but also resulted in widespread degeneration and necrosis of the contractile myocardium. Accumulation of lipopigment supports a pathogenetic role for lipoperoxidation in development of the cardiac lesions of E-Se deficiency. These lesions constitute a unique example of preferential damage to Purkinje cardiocytes. This model offers an attractive method of studying damage and repair to the cardiac conduction system.\r"

  ".U": "88131261\r", 
  ".W": "Leukotrienes (LT) B4 and D4, alone and in combination, were topically applied to the eyes of guinea pigs, and their effects on conjunctival leukocyte infiltration studied. LTD4 potentiated the neutrophil response to LTB4, even though no neutrophil emigration was evoked by LTD4 itself over a dose range of 10-1000 ng. LTB4 alone at the 1-ng and 10-ng doses failed to evoke any leukocyte emigration, but significant numbers of neutrophils were observed at these concentrations when LTD4 (1-1000 ng) was present. Although a dose-dependent increase in neutrophil infiltration was observed for the 100-ng and 1000-ng doses of LTB4, cell counts were substantially higher with these doses in the presence of LTD4. Eosinophil numbers increased in a dose-related manner in response to LTB4 and LTD4 alone, with a greater response to LTD4. The addition of either 10 ng or 100 ng of LTB4 to graded doses of LTD4 (10-1000 ng) caused increased eosinophil numbers, the lower dose of LTB4 potentiating the response to LTD4 and the higher LTB4 dose showing no significant effect. The effects on leukocyte infiltration that were evoked by the LT combinations could not be explained simply on the basis of an increase in vascular permeability. Bradykinin (BK), a potent conjunctival microvascular permeability factor that does not elicit any leukocyte infiltration, did not significantly potentiate LTB4-induced eosinophil or neutrophil emigration. The synergistic effects of LTs on leukocyte emigration are also difficult to ascribe to hyperemia (ie, increased blood volume in the conjunctiva), because both LTB4 and LTD4 caused only very modest increases in conjunctival blood content, and BK, which did not potentiate the leukocytic responses to LTB4, caused marked increases in tissue blood content. High-dose LT combinations caused eosinophils, but not neutrophils, to migrate into the conjunctival epithelium and fragment, resulting in overt tissue damage. These results further suggest a synergistic interaction between LTB4 and LTD4 that directly alters leukocyte function. The relevance of these observations to a number of disease and trauma states is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "88131263\r", 
  ".W": "Explants of mouse lung were cultured at various stages of injury after exposure to hyperoxia for determination of whether endothelial or epithelial injury alone could stimulate fibrosis in a blood-free environment. Mice were exposed to 95% O2 for periods up to 6 days. Then one lobe of lung was prepared for organ culture, and others were used for assessment of lung damage by morphologic studies and by the protein and cellular content of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Explants cultured when the lung showed endothelial injury only were not different from air-exposed controls. As alveolar damage, particularly to Type 1 epithelial cells, increased at 6 days, more protein was found by lavage; and after culture, overall DNA synthesis in explants was reduced. Autoradiography showed that epithelial cell proliferation was preferentially retarded while fibroblast growth became predominant. Collagen production was also significantly increased after 3 and 6 days of culture. In these explants there were few macrophages and no white blood cells or other blood components. Some mice, returned to air after hyperoxia, showed prompt epithelial repair, and cultures of these lungs were not different from controls. The results suggest that severe injury and retarded repair of the alveolar epithelium disturbs normal epithelial-fibroblast interactions and is sufficient to promote the fibrotic process. Less severe injury involving the endothelium only is not associated with fibrosis.\r"

Hepatocytes in the severe form of chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis strongly expressed SDLex. The antigen was only weakly and focally detected in chronic persistent hepatitis. The mild form of chronic active hepatitis showed intermediate expression. SDLex expressed along the liver cell membranes displayed a honeycomb pattern when extensively expressed in the severe form of chronic active hepatitis or in liver cirrhosis. Cytoplasmic expression was faint and focal. Preferential tissue distribution was at the periphery of the hepatic lobules where the distruction of the limiting plate was present. The antigen was also expressed in sinusoidal lining cells and polymorphonuclear cells but not in the biliary epithelia. Hepatocytes expressing SDLex did not express related carbohydrate antigens, ie, Type 2 chain N-acetyllactosamine, Lex, and sialylated Lea. On subcellular fractionation, the microsome fraction contained the majority of the antigen activity. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis revealed one major SDLex-active glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 110 kilodaltons. This glycoprotein was different from SDLex-active glycoproteins found in the sera of cancer patients. No ganglioside showed FH6 reactivity. These results indicate that liver cells in active inflammatory lesion expressed a novel glycoprotein carrying SDLex antigen in honeycomblike membrane-associated pattern.\r"

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method. Reactions of wheat germ (WGA) and peanut (PNA) agglutinin with neuraminidase treatment lectins were positive in 5 of 6 (83%) and 3 of 6 (50%) cases, respectively, in reactive mesothelial lesions. Thirteen of 23 (57%) malignant mesotheliomas of the pleura showed a positive reaction for WGA and PNA with neuraminidase treatment; other lectins were low-positive, below 9%. In contrast, pulmonary adenocarcinomas showed positive reactions in 27 of 28 cases (96%) for PNA, 26 of 28 (93%) for Ricinus communis (RCA-I), 25 of 28 (89%) for WGA, and 22 of 28 (79%) for succinylated WGA (SucWGA). The findings suggest that malignant pleural mesothelioma and pulmonary adenocarcinoma have consistent and distinct glycoconjugate profiles, and that stains for RCA-I and SucWGA may be useful for differential diagnosis.\r"

Periconceptional spermicide use was not associated with any important variation in the expected sex ratio at birth, nor with major or minor congenital anomalies. Exposure to spermicides in the periconceptional period, defined dichotomously as present or absent, was not associated with decreased birthweight in male or female infants. There was a slight decrease in birthweight among female infants with increasing duration of postconceptional spermicide use; an estimated 7.4 grams decrease with each day of use. The size of the effect and its selectivity by sex suggest a chance finding.\r"

A logistic regression analysis, in which the effects of race, marital status, age, and other risk factors for low birthweight were statistically controlled, showed that women not in the project were 1.32 times (95% Confidence Interval 1.14, 1.54) as likely as project participants to have a birth under 2500 grams. The relative risk for non-participants for a birth under 1500 grams was 1.87 (95% CI 1.25, 2.80). Strengths and limitations of the study are discussed. The results are consistent with previous work examining the etiologies of low birthweight in private versus public patients.\r"

Births to mothers who started smoking regularly at some time before delivery and who were still smoking at the time of the interview (the exposure definition) were compared with unexposed births. Our analysis of 4,444 single, live births delivered in public and private hospitals from 1946 through 1982 demonstrates that births to smoking women aged 20 and older delivering in public hospitals were 2.5 times more likely to weigh less than 2,500 grams (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9, 2.3), and on the average weighed 207 grams less (95% CI = 130, 284) than births to a comparable group of nonsmoking mothers. However, we found no other difference in birthweight between newborns of smoking and nonsmoking women when comparing their births within the same hospital category and age group. The data in this study suggest that the effect of smoking on birthweight among births to Puerto Rican women may be modified by maternal age and by whether the infant was born in a private or public hospital.\r"

The stools were prepared by formalin-ethyl acetate concentration followed by cold Kinyoun acid-fast stain of the sediment. In addition, 912 consecutive intestinal biopsies were monitored for the presence of the parasite. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in only 0.3 per cent of stool specimens (seven specimens from three patients) and in none of the intestinal biopsies. Due to this low prevalence of cryptosporidiosis, we conclude that routine screening of stool specimens for Cryptosporidium sp. is unnecessary in our patient population. Screening should be targeted to immune compromised patients and patients with persistent diarrhea and no apparent etiology. Our study also supports the concept that there are geographic variations in the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis.\r"

Injury rates in mining show no strong trend either up or down since 1960. Increases over recent years have been especially pronounced for strains and sprains, cuts, lacerations and punctures, bone fractures, and acute illnesses. Injury rates in the manufacturing sector are strongly influenced by general economic conditions--rising sharply with business upsurges and declining during recessions. Increases in the rate of unemployment, which decrease worker and labor union bargaining power, are associated with increases in injury rates within manufacturing.\r"

These concerns may precipitate epidemiologic or clinical investigations requiring large expenditures of state and federal resources regardless of whether such investigations are justified by scientific criteria. An alternative is a comprehensive feasibility study, utilizing all available information to determine whether large-scale studies are warranted or feasible. At a relatively modest cost, a feasibility study allows health officials to identify information needs and deficiencies, outline potential study options and costs, clearly establish the rationale for a proposed study or, conversely, prevent unwarranted expenditures of public resources. Furthermore, a feasibility study may in itself resolve many community and scientific concerns. This article provides a case study of the usefulness of a formal feasibility study in a situation involving an elevated cancer rate and contaminated municipal water supply wells surrounding a federal superfund site.\r"

The overall percentage of parous host-seeking S. ochraceum at the 4 localities ranged from 41%-49%. Host-seeking activity appeared to be concentrated near streams containing immature stages, and few females dispersed as far as 3 km away. S. metallicum was the second most frequently captured species; however, at the locality with the highest prevalence of onchocerciasis, its host-seeking density was much less than that of S. ochraceum. For S. metallicum, the overall percentage of parous females ranged from 28%-34% at the 4 localities. S. metallicum were consistently taken in much greater numbers in coffee cultivation areas than in housing areas. Host-seeking S. callidum and S. gonzalezi also were captured.\r"

Semimonthly catches of black flies were made on human volunteers at 4 localities with different prevalences of human onchocerciasis. Host-seeking activity of S. ochraceum reached its greatest magnitude in the early dry season (October-January) but then declined rapidly and was lowest during the late dry season (February-May). The frequency of O. volvulus larvae in parous host-seeking S. ochraceum also varied seasonally, and this variation was most pronounced for third stage larvae. At a hyperendemic locality, the highest frequency of this larval stage occurred during the February-March period (0.0142 in 1979 and 0.0095 in 1980). From June-January, the frequency of third stage larvae in S. ochraceum was less than 0.003. The frequency of early first stage larvae exhibited the least seasonal variation, ranging from 0.0354 in August-September to 0.0628 in April-May. The transmission rate of O. volvulus by S. ochraceum also varied seasonally. At the same hyperendemic locality, infective biting density of S. ochraceum attained its greatest magnitude in February-March. The survival rate of female S. ochraceum from one gonotrophic cycle to the next was estimated from the ratio of flies with early first stage larvae to those with infective stage larvae. These rates varied seasonally and ranged from 0.2132 to 0.3974, with the highest rates occurring in the late dry season.\r"

Classrooms were monitored daily for school absences. Fifty percent of the children had antibodies to, and were presumably immune to, at least 1 dengue serotype by the age of 7 years. Most (90/103, 87%) students who became infected by dengue viruses during the study period were either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (absent only 1 day). Most (7/13, 53%) of the symptomatic dengue infections (absent with fever for greater than or equal to 2 days) were clinically recognized as cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever which required hospitalization. None of 47 primary dengue infections required hospitalization, whereas 7 of 56 secondary infections did (P = 0.012). Preexistent dengue immunity, as detected by conventional serologic techniques, was a significant (odds ratio greater than or equal to 6.5) risk factor for development of dengue hemorrhagic fever.\r"

A reference enzootic strain from Colombia showed more genetic relatedness to three epizootic strains isolated in the same country, than to its own serogroup prototype strain isolated in Panama.

Antibody profiles on individuals nesting or feeding in enzootic areas were determined from serial blood samples drawn from these recaptured birds. The duration of detectable neutralizing antibody in these birds was found to be ephemeral in some species (e.g., black-capped chickadees) and extremely longlasting in others (e.g., gray catbirds, swamp sparrows).

Early diagnosis of gallstones in these patients remains problematic, but clinical and biochemical factors may aid ultrasonography in defining patients who require endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Early operation is advisable in patients with mild disease, but endoscopic papillotomy should be considered in those with severe disease who fail to stabilize after admission. Chronic pancreatitis is frequently associated with cholangiographic evidence of biliary obstruction, and serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations offer a valuable means of monitoring cholestasis. If operation is needed to deal with biliary obstruction, the options are to carry out Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy or resection of the pancreatic head, the choice being dictated by the indications for direct pancreatic operation.\r"

Eighteen patients underwent a subtotal gastrectomy, and a total of 10 patients presented with stage I disease. The longest median duration of survival at last follow-up was 32 months for patients with stage IB disease compared with a median duration of survival of 8 months for those with stage III disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy may improve survival after a curative resection is performed if there is serosal penetration or nodal involvement.\r"

In addition to the previously documented changes in biliary lipid composition, animals with gallstones had a significant increase in gallbladder bile concentrations of total and ionized calcium compared with control animals. The observation that hepatic bile levels of calcium remained unchanged in the cholesterol-fed animals suggests that the increase in gallbladder bile calcium is due to a gallbladder-related phenomenon, rather than an alteration in hepatic metabolism. We proposed that this increase in biliary calcium levels results from an increase in gallbladder absorption. Increased biliary calcium levels may be an important, previously unrecognized, factor in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones.\r"

  ".U": "88131490\r", 
  ".W": "POSCH is a prospective, randomized secondary intervention trial examining the effect of maximal lipoprotein modification achieved by partial ileal bypass on overall mortality and the course of coronary heart disease. In the initial 189 surgical patients, total cholesterol levels decreased from 256.7 +/- 2.6 mg/dl to 166.6 +/- 2 mg/dl, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased from 181.5 +/- 2.7 mg/dl to 94.1 +/- 1.7 mg/dl 3 months after operation. These significant decreases were sustained through 5 years of follow-up (p less than 0.001). The total cholesterol level was 29.2 +/- 0.9 percent lower and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 43.2 +/- 1 percent lower at 5 years compared with the baseline level. Decreases of similar magnitude were seen in each of the common WHO lipoprotein phenotypes. The baseline total cholesterol level was the only significant independent preoperative predictor of the 5 year total cholesterol level (correlation coefficient 0.547; p less than 0.001), and the baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was the only significant independent preoperative determinant of the 5 year low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (correlation coefficient 0.599; p less than 0.001). These relationships are expressed by the following equations: 5 year total cholesterol = 0.54 X baseline total cholesterol + 42.3, and 5 year low-density lipoprotein cholesterol = 0.455 X baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol + 19.2. The decrease in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels after partial ileal bypass are greater than reported by any trial of drug or diet intervention, including the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial which examined cholestyramine. Estimation of the change in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels after partial ileal bypass can be made based on preoperative lipid analysis and is essential in comparing different therapeutic modalities and assessing the role of partial ileal bypass among strategies aimed at lowering coronary heart disease risk.\r"

We postulated that the female preponderance of gallstone disease might partly be related to the effects of progesterone, a known smooth muscle relaxant, on specific receptors in the gallbladder wall, leading to stasis of bile. A total of 42 patients with gallstone disease and 28 control subjects underwent radionuclide scan imaging and their gallbladder ejection fractions were calculated in response to intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin octapeptide. Patients then underwent cholecystectomy and a piece of gallbladder fundus was assayed for the presence of progesterone receptors. Receptors were present in 60 percent of patients. As a group, gallstone patients had a decreased ejection fraction compared with control subjects. The presence of progesterone receptors in the gallbladder wall was associated with a decreased percentage of ejection compared with both healthy control subjects and patients whose gallbladders were receptor-negative. We conclude that progesterone receptors are present in the gallbladder wall of gallstone patients and that their presence correlates with impaired gallbladder emptying.\r"

Our analysis of survival after partial shunting with small-diameter portacaval H grafts has shown that both hepatic functional reserve and postoperative portal perfusion correlate with postoperative survival in alcoholic patients, but the latter was a stronger correlate of long-term survival. A predictive model based on both factors has been described for estimating the overall survival rate of alcoholics after partial shunting with small-diameter portacaval H grafts.\r"

Patients with infected pancreatic pseudocysts can be safely drained internally. The most common cause of extrahepatic biliary obstruction in this group of patients with pancreatic pseudocysts was stricture due to pancreatitis and fibrosis, not extrinsic compression.\r"

Between splenectomy patients and control subjects, there was no difference in the site of primary disease (rectum versus colon), the number of patients receiving adjuvant therapy, the technique of resection (cure versus palliation), or the extent of regional disease. Overwhelming sepsis occurred in only one splenectomy patient. Splenectomy was associated with a significant decrease in survival at 5 years in patients with regional (stage C) disease but not in patients with localized (stage B) disease. More splenectomy patients received blood transfusions than control subjects, but an independent effect on survival could not be demonstrated. The mechanism responsible for this adverse impact of splenectomy is undefined. However, splenectomy should be considered a possible factor in the survival of patients operated on for regional colorectal cancer.\r"

This study was performed to evaluate whether this substance might contribute to acute injury through its effects on mucosal microcirculation or by increasing permeability of the gastric mucosa to luminal acid. Platelet-activating factor was infused at a rate of 1 microgram/min directly into the artery supplying a chambered segment of canine gastric corpus and both significantly decreased venous outflow and mucosal blood flow and enhanced the efflux of volume, sodium ions, and potassium ions into the lumen. Thus, as in other capillary beds, platelet-activating factor appeared to induce stasis of flow and local accumulation of interstitial fluids which then leaked into the lumen. Platelet-activating factor did not significantly alter the back-diffusion of hydrogen ions into the mucosa. Thus, platelet-activating factor may not directly influence mucosal permeability to luminal acid, and it may predispose the gastric mucosa to acute injury through its effects on the microvasculature and other aspects of the inflammatory process.\r"

  ".W": "Using corrosion casting and scanning electron microscopy of the rat biliary tree, we investigated the site and size of the pathways that allow bacteria to reflux from bile to blood. Nonobstructed rat biliary trees were injected retrograde with methylmethacrylate resin at a constant rate of 0.04 ml/min to volumes of 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, and 200 microliters. The infusion pressure was monitored and a pressure-volume curve was constructed. After polymerization and corrosion in 30 percent potassium hydroxide, the casts were examined with scanning electron microscopy. In addition, to identify the size of the reflux pathways, ceramic particles of 150 A, 1.7 mu, or 10 mu were added to the resin, and the studies were repeated. Finally, intact livers with casted biliary trees were processed and studied by scanning electron microscopy without corrosion. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated fine anatomic detail of the cholangiovenous reflux pathway. At 40 microliters (20 cm water pressure), normal biliary radicals were filled. Between 40 and 80 microliters (20 to 50 cm water pressure), the cast material refluxed from the bile ductules into the spaces of Mall and Disse and then into the hepatic sinusoids. Filling of sinusoids continued at volumes between 80 to 160 microliters, and filling of collecting veins was seen above 160 microliters. Particles of 1.7 mu and smaller readily refluxed, but there was no sinusoidal reflux of casting material that contained particles of 10 mu. Casting without corrosion showed that the liver parenchyma remained intact. There was no evidence of reflux across hepatocytes. This study shows that cholangiovenous reflux occurs directly from bile ductules through the spaces of Mall and Disse into the hepatic sinusoids. The pathways measure between 1.7 and 10 mu. Since this is the path of least resistance, it may be of greater importance in the reflux of bacteria and toxins than other high-resistance pathways, for example, biliary canaliculi, tight junctions, or hepatocytes.\r"

Previous operation, low body weight, and having an ostomy were also related to septic complications. Patients receiving more than 1 unit of blood were significantly more likely to have low preoperative serum albumin levels, to have undergone abdominoperineal or small bowel resection, and to have an ostomy. Postoperative septic complications were significantly related to perioperative blood transfusions after controlling for these potential confounding factors independently by subgrouping and simultaneously by using multiple logistic regression. Blood transfusion may be a more significant factor in postoperative immune suppression and susceptibility to infection than previously recognized.\r"

Intragastric ethanol caused a small increase in pancreatic duct pressure (6 to 7 mm Hg) and an increase in duct permeability to dextran. Intravenous ethanol with exclusion of the sphincter of Oddi did not increase pancreatic duct pressure or permeability. Intravenous ethanol and intragastric normal saline solution altered neither pressure nor permeability. Artificial elevation of pancreatic duct pressure alone with no ethanol had no effect on duct permeability. However, when intravenous ethanol was given to produce similar systemic concentrations as achieved in the intragastric experiments (250 mg/dl) and duct pressure was artificially raised, duct permeability was increased. Ethanol concentrations similar to those found in peripheral blood were detected in secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice. Perfusion of the pancreatic duct with activated pancreatic enzymes after intragastric but not intravenous ethanol (that is, only in animals with increased duct permeability) caused acute edematous pancreatitis. Our results confirmed that increased duct permeability was necessary to produce acute pancreatitis in this model, and that this increase in permeability resulted from both a small increase in duct pressure and probably from the toxic metabolic effects of ethanol.\r"

Within 4 years, all five patients had the jejunal segment removed due to severe symptoms of gastric retention. These patients underwent reconstruction to create Roux-Y limb only and joined the pool of 17 patients who underwent Roux-Y diversion only for the dumping syndrome. Overall, 19 of 22 patients (86 percent) had almost complete resolution of their dumping symptoms on long-term follow-up. Three patients showed no improvement, two with severe gastric retention and one with recurrent dumping symptoms. Overall, 5 of 22 patients (23 percent) had moderate to severe early and late postoperative gastric retention necessitating medical treatment in three and subsequent near-total gastrectomy in two. Although other procedures such as pyloric reconstruction or the addition of isoperistaltic or antiperistaltic jejunal interpositions have been reported to be equally successful in delaying gastric emptying and resolving dumping symptoms, we have preferred Roux-Y diversion for the treatment of combined alkaline reflux gastritis and dumping or the pure early vasomotor postgastrectomy dumping syndrome. As reported, we have abandoned the use of an antiperistaltic jejunal segment interposed between the stomach and the Roux-Y limb due to the high rate of postoperative gastric retention.\r"

  ".W": "Because accurate diagnosis of the alkaline reflux gastritis syndrome has been elusive, surgical treatment has had a high failure rate, particularly with respect to relief of pain. We have used intragastric infusion of alkali as a provocative test in 147 patients with symptoms and endoscopic findings suggestive of bile gastritis and in 19 asymptomatic control subjects. Subjects received saline solution, 0.1 normal hydrochloric acid, and 0.1 normal sodium hydroxide solutions, as well as their own gastric aspirates in random blinded fashion by a nasogastric tube. There were no complications. A positive test result was defined as pain with sodium hydroxide but not with saline solution or hydrochloric acid infusion. All of the control subjects had negative test results. A total of 87 percent of the symptomatic patients have been followed (mean 4.3 years, minimum 1 year); 47 of those 128 had a Roux-Y gastrojejunal reconstruction to divert duodenal contents from the stomach. Correlation of the test results and the subsequent clinical status showed 87 percent of those with negative test results improved spontaneously or with other treatment versus 15 percent if the test results were positive (p less than 0.001), and 78 percent of those with positive test results had lasting relief of pain after surgical diversion versus a 30 percent success rate if the test results were negative (p less than 0.01). We conclude that positive alkali infusion test results predict that symptoms will likely respond best to surgical diversion of duodenal contents, and that negative test results should be a strong deterrent to surgical diversion. The test is safe, simple, and deserves further trial.\r"

Gallbladder distention, in turn, has been shown to affect sphincter of Oddi motility. Since gastric distention may accompany endoscopic or operative biliary manometry, we tested the hypothesis that gastric distention alters sphincter of Oddi motility. In the prairie dog model, gastric distention with acid (0.1 M hydrochloric acid, pH 1.3) and alkaline (10(-5) sodium hydroxide, pH 8.8) isotonic saline solutions both resulted in significant increases in sphincter of Oddi phasic wave frequency, amplitude, and motility index. Similarly, gallbladder pressure increased during both distention periods, thus confirming the previously described pylorocholecystic reflex. These responses were abolished by systemic pretreatment with atropine, suggesting that this reflex is cholinergically mediated. These data suggest the presence of a gastrosphincter of Oddi reflex whereby gastric distention stimulates sphincter of Oddi motility in the prairie dog. We conclude that gastric distention is an important variable to be controlled when performing endoscopic or operative sphincter of Oddi manometry.\r"
