Open breast biopsy remains the standard of care in diagnosing a malignant breast lesion. All breast biopsies should be planned as if the scar were to be excised by a definitive surgical procedure (either mastectomy or tylectomy). New lesions in the treated breast require immediate biopsy because of the high likelihood of recurrent disease. Preferably, definitive surgery for malignancy should not be delayed more than 2 weeks after biopsy.\r"

  ".W": "Most epithelial hyperplasias of the human breast indicate an increased likelihood of carcinoma development, and the majority are best understood as markers or indicators of higher risk. Prospective studies of women with hyperplasia biopsied in the premammographic era indicate that about 70 per cent of women had mild or no hyperplastic epithelial alterations and experienced no increase in the risk of subsequent carcinoma. About 25 per cent of women had well-developed hyperplastic changes associated with a risk 1.5 to 2.0 times that of the general population controlled for age and length of follow-up. Somewhat fewer than 5 per cent of women had specific patterns of atypical hyperplasia that approached the patterns of carcinoma in situ. The women with atypical hyperplasia had a risk of cancer four to five times that of the general population, or about half the risk associated with microscopic carcinoma in situ. Only ductal carcinoma in situ should be considered without question to be an intrinsically precancerous lesion because of its regular association with recurrence at the site of its initial diagnosis. No follow-up studies of comparable type involving women with mammographically detected lesions are as yet available. However, it is clear that the incidence of atypical hyperplasia is higher in mammographically directed biopsies. The principal therapeutic implication of these premalignant lesions is a need for intensified breast cancer surveillance and screening for these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Duct carcinoma in situ is now being detected with a frequency and at a size unknown prior to mammography. The majority of currently detected lesions are of limited extent and not associated with either occult invasion or axillary metastasis. For such limited duct carcinoma in situ, attempts at adequate local excision appear appropriate. Duct carcinoma in situ represents a number of biologically different processes that exhibit different frequencies of occult invasion and different risks for local recurrence after attempts at excision biopsy. The risks of local recurrence after a breast-conserving procedure without irradiation observing the selection criteria we employ can be estimated on the basis of the histologic subtype of the in situ carcinoma, the extent of disease, and the adequacy of the resection margins. In our prospective series, these risks ranged from 0 to 25 per cent for specific histologic subtypes at a median of 68 months of follow-up, with an overall frequency of recurrence of 12.6 per cent. All recurrences were local in the breast. Half were noninvasive disease, and all of the latter were initially treated by re-excision only. Other investigators report a similar experience. Invasive recurrences have been of minimal size, and all but one was free of nodal metastases. All patients are well at present. Three deaths have occurred secondary to cardiac disease.\r"

It was originally thought to be a stage in the progression to invasive lobular cancer, but current evidence suggests that it is a marker of increased risk. It is certainly the most powerful of all risk factors, with studies suggesting that approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients will go on to develop invasive cancer of various histologic types and with equal frequency in the biopsied and the opposite breast. There is general agreement concerning these facts, but considerable controversy remains about treatment. Haagensen and coworkers pioneered the concept of observation at a time when unilateral mastectomy was the standard treatment. Observation has gradually been accepted by the majority of American physicians, but it is a slim majority, and the patient's wishes will properly continue to play a role in the final decision.\r"

  ".W": "Rose Kushner, a well-known breast cancer patient advocate and medical journalist who contributed immeasurably to the changes that have taken place in breast cancer management today, summed up the communication dilemma succinctly. She stressed the importance of communication from physician to patient and from patient to physician. \"In order for it to work [well],\" she said, \"it has to go both ways.\" The essence of a mutually cooperative endeavor in health care assumes that reactions from both parties affect the nature and outcome of the interaction. Therefore, it is mandatory to examine the reciprocal flow of factors that shape the physician-patient interaction. Although public testimony often conveys the conviction that physician communications are limited or altered in an attempt to protect patients from emotional upset and that withholding information is in their best interest, a literature review demonstrated that this was not so. Interestingly, today, a contrary trend may be emerging, where some physicians are so forthright and blunt in their disclosure that the impact of a guarded prognosis is felt as an assault and carries with it a connotation of certainty for disaster. As was stated earlier in this article, a most useful beacon to guide the physician in this dimly lit path is the notion that \"congruence not candor\" direct the disclosure. The physician-patient interaction is a unique and somewhat fragile connection that must be viewed as more than an implicit service contract. It is a special collaborative effort that requires continuous monitoring and assessment in order to maximize gratification for both parties. Individuals on both sides of the stethoscope have feelings and needs that can operate to enhance or sabotage optimal physician-patient relations.\r"

Analysis of this series indicates that patients with T1N0 disease can be subdivided into different prognostic groups. Factors associated with an especially favorable prognosis in T1N0 cases are a primary tumor size of 1 cm or less; special tumor type such as tubular, medullary, papillary, or colloid carcinoma; and low-grade tumor. Relatively unfavorable tumor characteristics are size greater than 1.0 cm (especially the group 1.7 to 2.0 cm), the presence of lymphatic tumor emboli in the breast, blood vessel invasion, high-grade tumor or poor differentiation, and intense peritumoral lymphoplasmacytic reaction. The T1N0 patients whose tumors manifest the latter features may have longer disease-free survival as a result of adjuvant therapy. On the other hand, women in the T1N0 group with an especially favorable prognosis usually can be spared adjuvant therapy.\r"

Forty-seven patients (11%) were taking beta antagonists and 74 patients (17%) were taking calcium antagonists at the time of infarction. Patients receiving beta antagonists had a more frequent history of hypertension (p less than or equal to 0.001) and prior infarction (p less than or equal to 0.01) than those not so treated and patients receiving calcium antagonists had a more frequent history of prior infarction, prior angina, hypertension and diabetes (all p less than or equal to 0.001) than their nontreated counterparts. Stepwise logistic regression analysis found significant independent correlations between in-hospital death and the following variables: recurrent ischemia (p less than or equal to 0.001); proximal left anterior descending coronary infarct (p less than or equal to 0.001); 3-vessel disease (p = 0.002); patient age (p = 0.004); and initial total occlusion of the infarct artery (p = 0.022). After adjustment for these factors, beta antagonist use (mortality = 0 vs 8% without treatment) was still significantly correlated with improved survival (p = 0.048), whereas calcium-antagonist therapy made no difference in survival. Heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure upon presentation were significantly lower in patients treated with beta antagonists. Thus, beta-antagonists therapy, but probably not calcium-antagonist therapy, taken before reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction, may improve early survival compared to reperfusion alone. Larger studies will be required to confirm or refute these observations.\r"

Evidence has also been collected to suggest a circadian variation in the onset of sudden cardiac death and silent myocardial ischemia. No published reports have examined the time of onset of AMI in relation to time after awakening. The present study examines the times of onset of AMI in relation to awakening in 137 patients with confirmed AMI. Information concerning time of awakening on the day of AMI revealed a marked increase in the onset of initial AMI symptoms within the first hour after awakening. Of the patients studied, approximately 23% reported onset of the initial symptoms of AMI within 1 hour after awakening. An increased onset of symptoms of AMI soon after awakening was also observed when patients in whom the acute cardiac symptoms were known to or may have caused awakening were excluded from consideration. This was also noted in subgroups of AMI patients classified according to age, order and location of AMI. These results extend previous observations of the circadian morning increase of AMI onset and assist in narrowing the search for potential triggers of the circadian variation of onset of AMI to physiologic changes that may occur soon after awakening.\r"

At the conclusion of their delayed images the patients were reinjected at rest with approximately 1 mCi of thallium-201 and a third set of images was recorded. The images were presented at random in pairs (initial:delayed, initial:reinjection) to 2 experienced observers for qualitative scoring of 9 segments/patient. Of the 360 segments analyzed, concordance between the delayed and reinjected images occurred in 307 (85%). Of 141 segments that demonstrated a persistent perfusion abnormality on 3- to 4-hour delayed images, 44 (31%) were reassigned to a redistribution score after reinjection. In 9 patients, reinjection images provided the only evidence of ischemia from the scintigraphic data. In 13 of 14 vascular territories that demonstrated redistribution after reinjection, intact perfusion (either anterograde or via collaterals) was detected at coronary angiography. These data suggest that rest reinjection imaging may provide a means of detecting viable myocardium in segments that demonstrate a fixed perfusion abnormality on conventional 3- to 4-hour delayed thallium images.\r"

Two-hundred twenty-one patients (58%) had no exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias while 162 (42%) did. There was no difference between patients with and without exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias in terms of previous myocardial infarction (p = 0.61), incidence of fixed thallium-201 defects (0.06), number of diseased vessels (p = 0.09) and resting left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.06). In contrast, evidence of provocable ischemia (redistribution on thallium-201 and ST-segment depression on the electrocardiogram) were more likely (p less than 0.02) to be seen in patients with exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. Discriminant function analysis revealed that these 2 variables best separated patients with and without exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. In a 4- to 8-year follow-up, 89 patients had adverse cardiac events. Of these 89, there were 41 deaths, 9 nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 39 coronary revascularization procedures performed later than 3 months after catheterization. Patients with exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias were more likely (p = 0.01) to have these events than those without these arrhythmias. Moreover, these arrhythmias provided independent prognostic information beyond that provided by the thallium-201 stress test and coronary angiography. We conclude that exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias are associated with exercise-induced ischemia and provide prognostic information which adds marginally to that provided by other noninvasive and invasive parameters in ambulatory patients being evaluated for chest pain.\r"

Patients should also know proper exercise procedures, be aware that there is some degree of risk in exercise, know their exercise tolerance, understand self-monitoring procedures, and be sensitive to prodromal symptoms. The essential feature of prudent exercise is a gradual progression during which an individual remains well within the limits of his/her exercise tolerance.\r"

Catheter ablation was successful in 8 of 11 patients (73%). In the surgical group, the accessory pathway was interrupted successfully in all patients (100%). The mean duration (+/- standard deviation) of hospitalization was 6 +/- 2 days in the catheter ablation group and 8 +/- 4 days in the surgical group. The mean cost/patient, expressed in 1988 dollar values, was +14,116 +/- 4,493 in the catheter ablation group and +34,175 +/- 5,434 in the surgical ablation group (p less than 0.0001). The mean time lost from work or school was 10 +/- 5 days in the catheter ablation group and 60 +/- 16 days in the surgical group (p less than 0.01). Catheter ablation is significantly less expensive than surgical ablation of accessory pathways. Assuming that all patients in whom catheter ablation is unsuccessful subsequently undergo successful surgical ablation, the mean cost of definitive therapy in the catheter ablation group (+24,382 +/- 4,741) is still significantly lower than the cost in the surgical group (+34,175; p less than 0.001). An additional economic advantage of catheter ablation is that the mean time lost from work or school is 10 days compared to 60 days with surgical ablation.\r"

To test the impact of suboptimal atrial activation during treadmill exercise, 12 patients with normal sinoatrial node function and dual chamber pacemakers were evaluated in pacemaker modes with normal AV intervals allowing maximal atrial contribution to ventricular filling and with the shortest programmable nonphysiologic AV delay. During a double-blinded randomized crossover protocol, exercise performance was improved with physiologic AV filling in comparison with nonphysiologic AV filling: (1) mean increase in exercise time was 16 +/- 16% (mean +/- standard deviation) (p less than 0.05); (2) time to anaerobic threshold was increased by 23 +/- 28% (p less than 0.05); and (3) the level of perceived exertion during comparable stages of exercise was decreased. In 3 patients, exercise time was greater by greater than 35% in the physiologic AV filling mode. Resting echo-Doppler parameters of left atrial and ventricular function did not predict benefit from AV synchronization during exercise. During exercise with rate-responsive pacing an appropriate AV relation is beneficial, and in a subset of patients this benefit may be striking.\r"

Candidates for cardiac transplantation as well as patients not accepted for transplantation participated. During DDD pacing at an atrioventricular delay of 100 ms, left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 16.0 +/- 8.4 to 25.6 +/- 8.6% (p less than 0.001) accompanied by a striking improvement in clinical symptoms, such as severe dyspnea at rest and pulmonary edema. The New York Heart Association class decreased from 3.6 +/- 0.4 to 2.1 +/- 0.5 (p less than 0.001). The decrease in cardiothoracic ratio from 0.60 +/- 0.06 to 0.56 +/- 0.05 (p less than 0.001) coincided with a decrease in left atrial and right ventricular echocardiographic dimensions, indicating a decrease in preload. Systolic blood pressure increased from 108 +/- 29 to 126 +/- 21 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure from 67 +/- 15 to 80 +/- 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Normalization of heart rate was achieved. No major complications developed as a consequence of DDD pacing. All patients could be discharged from the hospital within 3 weeks after pacemaker implantation and return to a relatively normal life. Within 1 year after onset of DDD pacing only 4 of the patients died (from either sudden death or stroke). DDD pacing could represent an alternative approach to the management of chronic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, especially for heart transplant candidates and patients who are not accepted for cardiac transplantation, but no longer respond to drug therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Heart muscle disease in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), characterized by electrocardiographic changes or congestive cardiomyopathy, is a documented clinical problem, but its pathogenesis is obscure. In AIDS the heart is known to be involved by a variety of opportunistic infections as well as Kaposi's sarcoma, but no causative relation with the development of cardiomyopathy has been established. This study reports evidence for direct infection of the heart in AIDS, not by an opportunistic pathogen but by the AIDS, not by an opportunistic pathogen but by the AIDS virus itself, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For this study the technique of in situ deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization was applied to cardiac tissues obtained at autopsy from AIDS patients. Using sulfur-35-labeled ribonucleic acid probes encompassing the entire HIV genome, HIV nucleic acid sequences were detected in cardiac tissue sections from 6 of 22 patients examined who died of AIDS. The hybridization targets appeared to be cardiac myocytes, although their precise morphology was often obscured by the intensity of the signal. The myocardial cells showing a positive hybridization signal were sparse, often comprising only 1 or a few cells per section, and their number and location did not correlate obviously with any histopathologic or clinical evidence of heart muscle disease in these patients. It is conceivable that the presence of HIV nucleic acid sequences may represent a preclinical marker of impending AIDS-associated heart muscle disease. This sequela would not be recognized in many patients, including those in this series, who died rapidly of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma and other well-documented manifestations of AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect (ASD) was accomplished in 10 of 11 patients aged 13 months to 46 years (weight range 11 to 77 kg). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used simultaneously with fluoroscopic imaging in 4 of these patients aged 4.5 to 46 years (weight range 19 to 77 kg). TEE was used to ascertain defect size, position and number of defects and to ascertain appropriate seating of the defect occluder within the atrial defect. In 2 patients TEE-assisted transcatheter ASD closure was accomplished after previous attempts at transcatheter ASD closure, unaided by TEE, had been unsuccessful. The only unsuccessful ASD closure procedure occurred in the smallest patient in the series (an 11-kg 13-month-old), a child who was too small to undergo TEE using our 11-mm diameter endoscopic probe. The concomitant use of TEE with fluoroscopic imaging provides information that is unique and complementary and may improve the efficacy and safety of the transcatheter technique for ASD closure. The recent availability of a 7-mm diameter TEE probe will extend the use of TEE into the infant age group and may decrease the discomfort and potential morbidity of TEE in older patients.\r"

All patients underwent a standardized evaluation protocol and were the monitor for up to 1 month. In 14 patients, loop recording definitively determined whether an arrhythmia was the cause of symptoms (diagnostic yield 25%; 95% confidence intervals 14 to 38%). Diagnoses included unsuspected ventricular tachycardia (1 patient), high grade atrioventricular block (2 patients), supraventricular tachycardia (1 patient), asystole or junctional bradycardia from neurally mediated syncope (3 patients) and normal cardiac rhythms (the remaining 7 patients). Follow-up of all patients diagnosed as having nonarrhythmic syncope by loop recording showed that none of these patients died suddenly. Cardiac loop ECG recording is an important new diagnostic test in patients with syncope unexplained by Holter monitoring.\r"

The BC3 TAA was present in all gastric, colonic, and breast tumors, typically with a large proportion of tumor cells expressing antigen. The CC4 TAA was present in most of these tumors, generally with a lower proportion of tumor cells expressing antigen compared with that of BC3. Both of these TAAs were found in some epithelial cells in normal breast, stomach, and colon, however, the location of the two TAAs in normal tissue was different. With the use of both antibodies, an increase in the number of tumor cell-positive lymph nodes was found in patients with breast, gastric, colonic, and ovarian tumors, including detection of micrometastases in nodes from patients considered node negative on purely morphologic grounds. Immunohistochemical detection of micrometastases derived from adenocarcinomas appears to be superior to purely morphologic detection.\r"

Only rarely have their fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytomorphologic characteristics been reported. The authors have studied FNAs of ICNs in ten patients, including immunocytochemistry (ICC) directly on the aspirates. FNA yielded moderately to markedly cellular specimens with numerous individual cells and large aggregates. Although moderate pleomorphism was present in three cases, striking uniformity in nuclear size and contour and in delicate nuclear membranes was evident. Typically the round nuclei were eccentric, imparting a plasmacytoid appearance. Cytoplasmic granularity was noted in only a minority of tumor cells. Five of the ICNs were positive for chromogranin (CG). In comparison, seven ICNs were positive for CG in tissue sections. None of the cytologic material showed immunoreactivity with insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, or gastrin. Histologic material showed positivity for these hormones in 33% (three of nine), 22% (two of nine), 22% (two of nine), and 11% (one of nine), respectively. Although CG is the most useful immunocytochemical marker for ICNs, and thus is helpful in confirming a diagnosis of ICN in FNA material, it is negative in half of the cases and may be negative when the histologic material is positive.\r"

The gross features and light microscopic findings were consistent with those described as being microcystic adenomas, but in two cases the gross examination and gelatin-embedded giant slices revealed multiple, isolated development of tumors ranging from submacroscopic nodules to tumors 4.5 cm in diameter. The larger tumors often showed ragged margins with small satellite nodules around the masses. A central fibrolamellar stellate core with centrifugally radiating septation was found in most of the tumor masses, even in the smaller ones. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical findings revealed a single row of glycogen-rich epithelial cells, but participation of myoepithelial cells was not confirmed. Instead, vimentin-positive cells (pericytes) within the interstitial space incorporated closely with the basal lamina of the cyst wall. This study suggests that a small percentage of microcystic adenomas of the pancreas develop in multiple tumors, and some appear as a single tumor by their confluence.\r"

In these patients the clinical presentation of malignant lymphoma often overlaps with that of benign lymphoid proliferations. Both may include lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, blood and bone marrow dyscrasias, and lymphocyte-rich effusions. Because benign and malignant lymphocyte-rich effusions, as well as effusions from other malignancies, may contain large cells that resemble immunoblasts or Burkitt's cells, cytomorphologic characteristics alone are unreliable for definitive diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Usual immunotyping panels using antibodies to B- and T-cell markers frequently fail to demonstrate cell lineage in lymphoma cells of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The authors used gene rearrangement to confirm the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in effusions from three patients with AIDS when routine cell marker studies failed to demonstrate cell lineage or clonality. Use of biotinylated probes eliminated the need for handling radioactive material and enabled performance of studies in a routine immunohistochemistry laboratory.\r"

The authors showed this by doing a ProS CIEP on the same PEG supernate that was used for quantitative measurement of free ProS. The +/- 2 standard deviation (+/- 2 SD) ranges for free ProS were 81-133% for males and 50-130% for females. This striking male-female difference has been reported only twice before. With the use of a graph of values for free ProS versus prothrombin time (PT), patients with inherited ProS deficiency segregated cleanly from normals and from patients on warfarin therapy without ProS deficiency until the PT was greater than 20 seconds. There is overlap of total ProS antigen values between normals and patients with inherited ProS deficiency.\r"

Patients with chronic gastritis (20), peptic ulcer (24), hepatic cirrhosis (10), chronic renal failure (13), or gastric remnant (20) were included. Endoscopic biopsy specimens stained with the Warthin-Starry stain were evaluated for the presence of CP. Blood and gastric juice analysis was performed for 11 of the patients with chronic renal failure and 37 patients from the remaining groups. CP was identified in gastric biopsies from 50 of 87 (57.5%) patients, including 87.5% with peptic ulcer and 40-50% of those with chronic gastritis, cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, or gastric remnant. CP infection had no effect on blood urea nitrogen or blood ammonia levels in any group of patients. The urea nitrogen level of gastric juice was higher in patients with chronic renal failure than in other groups but was not related to CP infection. CP infection was associated with a significant increase in gastric juice ammonia levels, both in patients with chronic renal failure (23.3 mmol/L vs. 2.90 mmol/L; [P less than 0.05]) and in other groups (5.48 mmol/L vs. 1.26 mmol/L [P less than 0.0001]).

The standard method for assessing the proliferating fraction has been the measurement of the tritiated thymidine labeling index (TLI). Ki-67 is a monoclonal antibody that labels proliferating cells. In this study, the authors compared the proliferative activity of seven solid tumor specimens, using both methods simultaneously, on comparable sections from the same specimen. As expected, in every case the Ki-67 labeling index (KiLI) was greater than the TLI. The mean TLI ranged from 4.4 +/- 0.4% to 16.7 +/- 10.2%. The KiLI from these same tumors ranged from 25.7 +/- 8.6% to 41.2 +/- 12.2%. The mean coefficient of variation for measurements from different sections within the same specimen was 28.8 for TLI and 16.4 for KiLI. Therefore, KiLI shows less variability within different sections of the same specimen and is, therefore, a more reliable marker for proliferative activity than is TLI.\r"

In 31,622 placentas the amount of this fibrin was related to markers of fetal activity. Fibrin was often absent when the markers indicated hypoactivity. The markers of fetal hypoactivity were neonatal hypotonia, neonatal lethargy, the presence of Down's syndrome, and a short umbilical cord. Umbilical cord length is strongly influenced by tension applied to it by fetal movements--the fewer the movements, the shorter the cord. Children with no subchorionic fibrin subsequently had increased frequencies of cerebral palsy and low intelligence quotient values. Children who were hyperactive at one year of age had increased levels of subchorionic fibrin, which suggests that they were hyperactive before birth. All of these findings raise the possibility that normal fetal movements sometimes traumatize the placenta, which leads to fibrin deposits beneath its surface.\r"

Platelets were detected by electron micrograph in the platelet-poor plasma preparation without filtration. No platelets or platelet fragments were seen after filtration. Freezing the unfiltered specimens resulted in a significant increase in the beta-TG and PF4 concentrations, presumably because of release of these proteins from the platelet alpha-granules during freezing and thawing. There was no change in the PF4 levels and only a slight decrease in beta-TG levels after freezing of the filtered specimens. The filtered samples could be frozen for later batch analysis, resulting in considerable cost savings to the laboratory.\r"

During the course of her stay, adult respiratory distress syndrome, hemolytic anemia, renal failure, neurologic dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia appeared. A clinical diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) accompanied by polymyositis and Sjogren's syndrome was made. She died two weeks after the beginning of plasmapheresis, and an autopsy was performed. Immunohistochemistry disclosed deposits of IgM, fibrinogen, and C1q in glomeruli and arterioles and deposits of C3 in small arteries. von Willebrand's factor antigen, which promotes the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium, was positive in onion-peeled arteries of the kidney and the spleen. These results suggest that immune complexes may have triggered a sequence of events from vascular endothelial injury to TTP.\r"

This experience was reviewed to determine the relationship of blood loss, postoperative hyperbilirubinemia, and the performance of concomitant surgical procedures to operative mortality, local tumor recurrence, and long-term survival. There were no deaths among 16 elective resections. Of 16 patients undergoing emergency resections, seven died (43.8%). The mortality rate correlated strongly with intraoperative transfusion of more than 10 units of blood and with postoperative hyperbilirubinemia. Performance of additional procedures increased mortality significantly after emergency, but not elective, hepatic resection. Median survival was 53.4 months in patients resected for hepatoma and 33.5 months in those patients resected for metastatic colon lesions. Local recurrence in a patient with hepatoma was managed by resection at 13 months, with no evidence of further recurrence at 69 months.\r"

Cells collected in this manner were assessed for abnormalities indicative of cancer. We have called this technique endoscopic retrograde wire-guided brush cytology (ERWBC). Thirty-nine strictures (24 malignant, 15 benign) in 34 patients were brushed. There were no complications, and all specimens were adequate for evaluation. Sixty percent of patients with cancer were diagnosed by ERWBC. Sensitivity was highest for cholangiocarcinoma (100%), intermediate for pancreatic cancer (60%), and lowest for patients with biliary obstruction due to metastatic disease (22%). There were no false-positive results (specificity, 100%). The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 58%, respectively, and accuracy for the test was 72%. Collection of cytological specimens using a brush with a wire guide is effective especially for diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. A positive result is sufficient evidence for malignancy, and other invasive diagnostic tests are unnecessary. We recommend ERWBC for brushing all strictures of unknown cause during ERCP in an effort to make a diagnosis of cancer.\r"

Of the three evoked potentials, visual evoked potential (VEP) studied by the pattern shift reversal method was not found to be abnormal in any patient. Short latency somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) was abnormal in one (4.5%) and brain stem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) in nine (41%) patients. There was little advantage of performing both BAEP and SSEP in a patient, since the two together were abnormal in 10 (45.5%) patients, with SSEP adding only one more patient. Interpeak latencies I-III, III-V, and I-V in BAEP test were found to be the most sensitive parameters for the detection of SHE. Our results argue in favor of BAEP as the single investigation of choice for the objective assessment of SHE in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.\r"

Thirty-two were given ST 4.2 micrograms/min, and 22 patients were given VP 0.4 IU/min for 72 h after endoscopic diagnosis. The role of alcoholic cirrhosis was similar in both groups. Initial control of bleeding was achieved significantly more often (p = 0.0281) when ST was used (84.4%) than during VP treatment (57.1%). Rebleeding occurred in 18.8% and 4.8%, respectively. Side effects of treatment were significantly more common when VP was used than during ST treatment (p = 0.0021). Overall mortality was high in both groups, being 34% in the ST group and 36% in the VP group. ST infusion seems to be more effective and safer than VP in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding. However, the high frequency of rebleeding during ST treatment means that, after primary hemostasis with ST infusion, other methods, such as surgery or sclerotherapy, are needed to prevent the serious complications of rebleeding.\r"

Identification of HP-like microorganisms included Warthin Starry stains of tissue sections, rapid urease test on fresh tissue, and culture. HP-like microorganisms were found in the stomachs of 35/36 ferrets. The highest density of microorganisms was seen in the antrum, where HP-like microorganisms were present in the pits and in deep glands. HP-like microorganisms were also seen in the cardia and on the foveolar epithelium of the fundus, but not in fundic glands. Chronic active gastritis was seen in all animals with HP-like microorganisms, but involved only the antrum. The distal antrum was most severely involved. One animal had no evidence of HP-like microorganisms on tissue sections or by rapid urease test. Gastric tissue sections from this animal showed only minimal infiltration of the lamina propria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes. Gastritis associated with HP-like microorganisms is common in ferrets and is acquired at a young age. It is associated with chronic active antral gastritis similar to that seen in humans, suggesting that ferrets should provide a useful experimental model for HP-associated gastritis and peptic ulcer.\r"

In 112 patients (50.2%) with 118 gastric ulcers, intestinal metaplasia in the different types was observed. The data obtained allow us to state that severe dysplasia and gastric cancer can occur only in a restricted number of patients with intestinal metaplasia in gastric ulcers and/or gastric ulcer tissue repair (two in our study, more than 60 yr old), and only in the forms with sulphomucins, more precisely type III. In relation to the fact that gastric ulcers rarely become carcinoma, the intestinal metaplasia frequently observed should not be considered \"precancerous\", as such, but could become so in the presence of several factors which, excluding age, did not emerge from our study.\r"

The incidence of a history compatible with cow's milk sensitivity was 8.5% (3/35) in patients with Crohn's disease and 2.8% (1/36) in controls. Patients with ulcerative colitis had a significantly greater prevalence of symptoms, compared with the other patient groups (20.9%, 9/43; p less than 0.03). In addition, patients with a history of cow's milk allergy, who subsequently developed ulcerative colitis, did so at an earlier age (6.68 +/- 2.05 yr vs. 10.62 +/- 0.74 yr: p less than 0.02) than those without a history of cow's milk sensitivity. Thus, there appears to be a potential relationship between early cow's milk sensitivity and the development of ulcerative colitis.\r"

The number of polyps ranged from five to 30 (median, six). There was no significant difference in the location of polyps between groups I and II. Eight of 52 patients (15%) were found to have colon cancer at the initial colonoscopy. In group I, there were six cancers (24%), five of which were in the cecum. Two of 27 patients (7%) in group II had cancer, one of which was located in the cecum.

These were as uncomplicated as mucous plugs or as serious as polyps or carcinoma. We found a high incidence of diversion colitis in the excluded colon. Because of these abnormal findings, endoscopy of the bowel distal to a colostomy at regular intervals is recommended. Mucous plugs and scybala should be treated by irrigation, while polyps and carcinoma should be treated as they would in the nondiverted colon. Diversion colitis can be treated medically with local steroids, or surgically. In most cases, even in severe colitis, we recommend closure of the colostomy.

Hemoperfusion is usually chosen to treat parathion intoxication, but carries the risk of causing hemorrhages in acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Clinically, it is therefore important to determine, by way of enzyme estimations and imaging procedures, whether acute pancreatitis has occurred following parathion intoxication, so that the prognosis for the poisoned patient is comprehensive enough and the antidated measures applied do not aggravate the pancreatic condition.\r"

To this end, allopurinol (50 mg qds)--a hydroxyl scavenger and an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase which forms superoxide radicals--and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO, 500 mg qds)--a hydroxyl scavenger--were given orally. Three hundred and two consecutive patients with previous symptomatic, endoscopy-proven duodenal ulceration which had been shown endoscopically to have healed and who were smokers and social drinkers, were randomized to receive for one year either placebo, cimetidine 400 mg at bedtime, allopurinol, or DMSO. In two hundred and twenty patients evaluable for efficacy, the cumulative relapse at one year was: placebo 65%, cimetidine 30%, allopurinol 12% and DMSO 13%. Cimetidine was significantly effective (p less than 0.01); however, allopurinol and DMSO were equally efficacious and superior to cimetidine (p less than 0.05). In patients who relapsed, the ulcer recurrence tended to occur early on placebo and to be evenly distributed over the year on active therapy. In all the groups, the relative frequency of symptomatic to silent relapses was similar in the first and second halves of the year and was comparable among the groups. The results suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals are directly implicated in the mechanism of duodenal ulcer relapse and that removing the radicals reduces recurrence of this ulceration.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) in re-expansion pulmonary edema, a unilateral lung injury due in part to re-oxygenation of hypoxic, collapsed lung tissue. The hypothesis underlying this investigation was that extracellular superoxide contributed to the lung inflammation in this model, and that PEG-SOD could be used to test for extra-cellular superoxide involvement. The right lungs of 2-3 kg rabbits were collapsed for seven days by intrapleural air injections. Immediately prior to lung re-expansion, rabbits received intravenously 10,000 units/kg PEG-SOD (n = 6) or an equal volume of H2O2-inactivated PEG-SOD (n = 6). Inactive PEG-SOD pretreated rabbits had a marked increase in re-expanded lungs' lavage albumin concentration (right 1653 +/- 230 micrograms/ml, left 404 +/- 160 micrograms/ml; p less than .01). Active PEG-SOD did not inhibit this permeability increase (right 1744 +/- 242 micrograms/ml, left 180 +/- 53 micrograms/ml; p less than .01). However, active PEG-SOD significantly decreased both total number and percent neutrophils in alveolar lavage (right 24.8 +/- 9.4%, left 4.2 +/- 0.8%; p less than .05) compared to inactive PEG-SOD pretreated rabbits (right 52.8 +/- 5.8%, left 8.7 +/- 2.4%; p less than .01). Pretreatment with active PEG-SOD significantly increased lung tissue (20.4 +/- 1.5 units/mg DNA), blood (400 +/- 8 units/ml) and right lung lavage (30.0 +/- 3.1 units/ml) SOD activities compared to those from inactive PEG-SOD pretreated rabbits (respectively: 16.0 +/- 1.0 units/mg DNA, 335 +/- 14 units/ml and 10.8 +/- 1.3 units/ml; p less than .05 for each comparison).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diagnoses were confirmed in 89% at necropsy examination. The contraceptive method used by patients was determined in 84% by means of inquiry sent to family planning clinics. Among the 20 patients who died of pulmonary embolism, four died while taking the pill, which gives a relative risk of 1.2 (95% confidence limits, 0.37 to 3.62; p = 0.78). The corresponding values for death from myocardial infarction and intracranial hemorrhage were 0.19 (95% confidence limits, 0.05 to 0.70; p = 0.01) and 0.36 (95% confidence limits, 0.18 to 0.70; p = 0.03), respectively.

There were 380 nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 105 deaths from coronary disease, 282 strokes, and 48 other cardiovascular deaths. We observed virtually no differences in the rates of various cardiovascular diseases between never and past users of oral contraceptives, regardless of duration of use or time since last use. For major coronary disease, the relative risk was 0.8 (95% confidence intervals, 0.6 to 1.0). A quantitative meta-analysis of 13 studies yielded an estimated relative risk of 1.01 (95% confidence intervals, 0.91 to 1.13) for coronary heart disease. Past use of oral contraceptives has little or no impact on risks of subsequent cardiovascular diseases.\r"

Sixty-eight healthy women who did not take hormonally active drugs or were pregnant the previous 3 months took either 75 micrograms of gestodene + 30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol or 150 micrograms of desogestrel + 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol during 12 cycles. During the first three cycles serum levels of the following parameters increased: triglycerides, cholesterol in high-density lipoprotein, and apolipoproteins A1, A2, and B. Additional increase was observed in apolipoprotein B only after three and six cycles. The induced changes were not significantly different in the two groups, and the levels generally remained within normal limits. The changes seen with both pills reflect a mild estrogenic dominance. On the basis of current knowledge, moderately altered lipoprotein metabolism is not expected to impose an extra risk of atherosclerosis.\r"

During 12 months of treatment, the effects of two oral contraceptives containing 30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol and 150 micrograms of desogestrel (EE/DG) or 75 micrograms of gestodene (EE/GSD) on 19 serum parameters of lipid metabolism were followed in 11 women each. There was no change in total cholesterol and phospholipids. Total triglyceride levels were significantly elevated only by EE/GSD. After 3 and 6 months of intake of both preparations, a transitory increase in the triglyceride content of very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein and a decrease in low-density lipoprotein-phospholipids was observed. After 12 months, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein phospholipids, and apolipoprotein B were significantly elevated, whereas very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides and all components of low-density lipoprotein were unchanged. Most of the components of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were increased as a result of a rise in HDL3 and apolipoprotein A2, whereas HDL2 and apolipoprotein A1 were not altered. There was no significant difference between the effects of the two preparations, although those of EE/GSD were mostly more pronounced. The increase in high-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein, and total triglycerides reflects a slight preponderance of the effect of the estrogen component. Because low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol were not changed, treatment with both formulations is in all probability not associated with an elevated risk of atherosclerosis.\r"

Each woman had three samples drawn, corresponding to the follicular phase, midcycle, and the luteal phase. Basal conditions were obtained by taking samples in the morning while subjects were still in bed. No changes were found in lipids and lipoproteins during the menstrual cycle. Antithrombin III and factor VII of the coagulation system did not change throughout the cycle. Fibrinogen increased in the luteal phase, and all samples of fibrinogen correlated positively with progesterone concentration. This increase, therefore, could be a progesterogenic effect. In conclusion, these findings suggest that when studied optimally no changes in lipids and lipoproteins are found and that the day of blood samples is of minor importance, for instance, when used as a control in studies of oral contraceptives. For investigations on some coagulation parameters, the days of the cycle may be of importance.\r"

Blood was taken before and after one or two cycles of low-dose oral contraceptives. After oral contraceptives a reduction in clotting time in native platelet-rich plasma and activated partial thromboplastin time were observed. Recalcification times in whole blood and platelet-rich plasma were shorter than clotting times in their native counterparts. The observed changes are compatible with a procoagulant effect seen soon after the start of oral contraceptive use. The absence of these changes in the recalcification times in citrate systems suggests a masking effect of citrate. The reduction in clotting times in native platelet-rich but not in platelet-poor plasma indicates that the hypercoagulability in oral contraceptives users is mainly related to platelets.\r"

Two identical groups were treated by Marvelon (a monophasic oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel) or Trigynon (a triphasic oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) for a 6-month period. In the absence, previously controlled, of substantial differences between the effects of each treatment on hemostasis, all the results were pooled at the third and sixth month of the study. The effects of oral contraceptive treatment were as follows: (1) platelet number, platelet aggregating ratio, and plasma beta-thromboglobulin level were not significantly altered, and (2) antithrombin III activity was not reduced despite a slight decrease or antigen concentration. The von Willebrand factor parameters, factor VIII:C, factor VII:C, and clottable fibrinogen were significantly increased. Plasminogen (activity and antigen concentrates) and alpha 2-antiplasmin levels were also significantly increased. Activated partial thromboplastin time and euglobulin lysis time measured after venous occlusion were significantly shortened. Although statistical analysis did not show dramatic changes in all these parameters, some individual extreme values were substantially altered. Therefore we believe that these later values are worthy of cautious consideration for weighing the role that hemostasis factors might play in individual thrombotic risk.\r"

No changes in platelet (beta-thromboglobulin, platelet aggregate ratio, and megathrombocyte) and routine clotting assays were observed. Factor VIIc/factor VIIag ratio and fibrinopeptide A values showed a significant (p less than 0.005) increase after three cycles of both treatments. A slight, significant increase (p less than 0.01) in antithrombin III activity was observed during triphasic treatment. Protein C was unchanged. Fibrinolytic activity and plasminogen levels were significantly increased (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001). After 6 and 9 months, the factor VIIc/factor VIIag ratio was still significantly enhanced, whereas fibrinopeptide A values significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased, even if they were higher (p less than 0.05) than basal values. The persistence of factor VII activation without enhanced thrombin formation after long-term use of oral contraceptives suggests that at that time the activity of antithrombotic mechanisms counteracts the prothrombotic tendency, thus helping to minimize unwanted side effects on hemostasis during long-term drug administration.\r"

Evidence of the vascular complications of oral contraceptives suggests that venous thromboembolism correlates with estrogen dosage and arterial complications with both estrogen and progestogen components. In 60 healthy, randomly allocated women, the effects of ethinyl estradiol, 30 micrograms, combined with gestodene, 75 micrograms, and desogestrel, 150 micrograms, on blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet function were compared. Subjects were studied before oral contraceptive use, at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks of treatment, and at 6 and 12 weeks after treatment. Both oral contraceptives affected the hemostatic system, but our results indicate that the ethinyl estradiol/gestodene combination causes changes in the hemostatic system similar to those in the ethinyl estradiol/desogestrel combination. Factors VII and X activity were slightly higher with the ethinyl estradiol/desogestrel combination than with the ethinyl estradiol/gestodene combination, possibly reflecting a greater estrogenic effect.\r"

Therefore we studied generation and resolution of fibrin in 28 healthy women above age 30 years, using oral contraceptives containing 30 to 50 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol. Thirty healthy nonusers served as control subjects. The oral contraceptive group had increased plasma concentration of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (p less than 0.01), which indicated an enhanced generation of thrombin, increased plasma activity of tissue-type plasminogen activator (p less than 0.01), decreased plasma activity of plasminogen activator inhibition (p less than 0.01), and increased plasma concentration of fibrin degradation products (p less than 0.04). Interestingly, the ratio of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes/fibrin degradation products did not deviate significantly between groups. Twelve of the 28 women using oral contraceptives were light smokers, that is, less than 15 cigarettes per day. There were no differences in the determined variables between smokers and nonsmokers. Our study suggests that healthy women older than 30 years who use oral contraceptives containing 30 to 50 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol have an enhanced generation and resolution of fibrin, while the hemostatic balance is unaltered. These findings are unaffected by moderate cigarette smoking.\r"

The authors have determined the histologic distribution of the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor in normal tissues by immunohistochemical technique. The studies revealed that the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor was expressed on fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells from multiple sites including skin, tonsil, breast, sweat gland, gastrointestinal tract, lung, bladder, cervix, and prostate. Follicular dendritic cells of the lymph node, tonsil, and spleen and dendritic cells of the thymus also expressed the alpha 2 beta 1 receptor. The receptor also was present on Schwann cells of ganglia and on neuroglia. Greatly enhanced expression of the receptor in regions of proliferating epithelium suggests that enhanced expression of alpha 2 beta 1 is associated with orderly, regulated cell proliferation. The circumferential staining pattern of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin within many epithelia is virtually identical to that observed for other adhesive receptors, such as the cadherins, which have been implicated in cell-cell adhesion.\r"

Small asbestos fibers were totally ingested by the macrophages, but fibers too long to be taken up completely remained as a consequence extracellular. These long asbestos fibers became the basis for asbestos body formation. The basic mechanism underlying asbestos body formation was found to be the exocytotic activity of macrophages. The number of iron-rich inclusion bodies was dependent on the availability of iron in the culture media, and the same holds for the amount of iron in the asbestos body coat. This means that asbestos body formation is a phenomenon that occurs accidentally when macrophages come into contact with long fibers in an iron-rich environment. A time-dependent increase in the number, average size, and rate of segmentation of the asbestos bodies was observed. The present report is the first to describe asbestos body formation in vitro.\r"

Its cause is unknown. It has been suggested that NH may represent an unusual manifestation of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), which is human leukocyte antigen (HLA) linked. Evidence for major rearrangements or deletions at the HLA class I region and at three loci directly involved in iron metabolism (H- and L-apoferritin and the transferrin receptor [TfR]) was sought. The population studied included five probands with NH and 14 first-degree family members in a total of six kindreds. Also sought were HLA associations with NH by collating the results of HLA serotyping in these 19 persons and in 17 members of 7 additional kindreds in which NH has occurred, including 5 probands with NH and 12 first-degree family members. We found no evidence for major rearrangements or deletions in H- or L-apoferritin genes, in TfR genes, or within the HLA locus. We found no evidence for linkage of NH to HLA serotypes. We conclude that while NH and HH are similar in their patterns of iron loading, they are not genetically related.\r"

Three distinct cell-matrix patterns of intra-alveolar bud were found to represent the sequential evolution of the fibrotic process: fibrinoid inflammatory cell clusters in which immunoglobulins and procoagulant factors (fibrinogen, factors VII and X) were identified; fibroinflammatory buds in which desmin-containing fibroblasts were observed migrating, proliferating, and secreting matrix proteins; fibrotic buds in which myofibroblasts organized a loose connective matrix predominantly composed of fibronectin and type III collagen. Extending forms of fibrotic buds may join contiguous alveoli. Fibrotic bud remodeling ability is correlated to the nature and organization of the matrix components but the factors permitting intra-alveolar matrix degradation must be characterized.\r"

A direct and massive transformation of the cultured fibroblasts into myofibroblasts was observed as early as 24 hours after laser treatment, whereas control cultures were comprised of only resting fibroblasts and active fibroblasts. This in vitro induction of myofibroblasts may be analogous to that which occurs in vivo. Therefore we undertook a similar study using biopsies from gingival tissues after wisdom tooth extraction. Myofibroblasts were present in the connective tissue of laser-treated gums 48 hours after irradiation, but not in untreated contralateral control tissues. These data provide evidence that the primary biologic effect of the Helium-Neon laser on connective tissue is the rapid generation of myofibroblasts from fibroblasts. The induction of a phenotype with contractile properties may have clinical significance in the acceleration of the wound-healing process.\r"

Rat carotid arteries were denuded of endothelium, exposing the thrombogenic subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) to the circulation. Rats were killed after 1 hour, or 5, 10, or 20 days. Thrombospondin antigen deposition in the injured arteries was assessed using a specific polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbit against rat platelet TSP and a sensitive silver-enhanced immunogold staining method. Faint immunostaining for TSP antigen was detected, associated mostly with cells, in the media of the carotid artery of the nonoperated controls. One hour after balloon catheter injury, however, prominent cell-associated immunostaining was evident in the media; extracellular matrix staining was negligible. At this time, large foci of immunostaining were present on the lumenal surface of the vessel. Intimal proliferation was evident on most stained sections of tissue taken 5 days after balloon injury. Thrombospondin antigen immunostaining was markedly increased compared to nonoperated controls in all sections, regardless of the degree of intimal thickening. Thrombospondin immunostaining remained associated with cells in the neointima and media; extracellular matrix staining remained negligible. Ten days after endothelial injury, immunostaining for TSP antigen was detected in all layers of the artery, but was greater in the neointima and media. Reaction product was still associated only with cells. Thrombospondin antigen levels, as detected by this procedure, remained high in the injured tissue through 10 days of observation but appeared less prominent 20 days after injury. At this time extracellular matrix staining was obvious and cell-associated staining was reduced. These data support the hypotheses that thrombospondin (TSP) expression by vascular smooth muscle cells is an early response to injury and that the primary source of TSP antigen in injured artery is the vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). These results support data derived from in vitro studies of TSP secretion.\r"

The authors have analyzed the expression of the pre-A4 amyloid proteins in several tissues by immunogold electron microscopy and by immunofluorescence. For this purpose, they have used a mouse monoclonal antibody and a guinea pig antiserum raised against two synthetic peptides corresponding to two different sequences common to all the full-length forms of the A4 amyloid precursors. They observed a tissue-specific distribution of the secreted and the transmembrane form of the precursors. The authors could determine that the secreted form is generated in vivo within the cytoplasm. In the salivary glands and in the adenohypophysis, all the immunoreactivity is associated with the process of secretion, whereas in the muscle, a staining pattern compatible with the presence of the pre-A4 amyloid proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been observed. This difference in the localization may reflect tissue-specific processing pathways and suggests that posttranslational modifications such as proteolytic removal of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains contribute to the structural and thus functional diversity of the A4 amyloid precursors.\r"

Tissues from labile organs, in which cell renewal is prominent (uterus, intestine, and transitional epithelium of the urinary tract), showed strong antioxidant enzyme immunostaining in differentiated cells but not in stem cells. In stable organs, in which cell renewal occurs at a high rate only in response to injury (kidney and adrenal), each cell type showed a specific pattern of antioxidant enzyme immunostaining. In permanent organs (brain and heart), antioxidant enzymes were regionally specific markers. Axons of the cerebellum showed more intense antioxidant enzyme staining than those of the cerebral cortex; in the heart, atria stained more intensely than ventricles. Germ cells of the testis resembled cell renewal systems in their antioxidant enzyme-immunostaining pattern: spermatogonia were negative, whereas spermatozoa were strongly positive. The tubules of the kidney showed no antioxidant enzyme immunostaining until after birth. Our results suggest that there is a prominent role for antioxidant enzymes in cell differentiation during development and cell renewal.\r"

  ".W": "Mesangial pathology is a hallmark of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FGS). In an immunologically mediated mesangial cell (MC) injury model, we analyzed the relationship between mesangial hypercellularity, increased macromolecular uptake by the mesangium, and long-term pathologic sequelae. A single injection of monoclonal anti-Thy-1 (AT) antibody induces MC apoptosis, extensive mesangiolysis, proteinuria, MC proliferation, and hypercellularity. Immunohistologic analysis indicated influx of ED 1-positive macrophages after 24 hours, which gradually subsiding thereafter. At day 12, hypercellularity was due to smooth musclelike MCs, and macrophagelike MCs were absent. Injection of iron dextran in nephritic rats indicated that mesangial uptake of iron correlated with mesangial hypercellularity, but was independent of proteinuria. Long-term studies showed no difference after 19 weeks in FGS between nephritic and control rats. In conclusion, although mesangiolysis is accompanied by influx of macrophages, a phase of smooth musclelike MC proliferation and increased macromolecular uptake, these pathologic events do not result in chronic mesangial pathology and FGS.\r"

  ".W": "Sequestration of calcium by mitochondria is an important mechanism to maintain normal intracellular calcium homeostasis. Anoxic or toxic damage to these organelles has been postulated to disrupt intracellular calcium compartmentalization, leading to cell death. The authors examined the potential relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium homeostasis, and irreversible injury in a model system of silica-induced toxicity to P388D1 cells. Exposure to toxic silica particles, but not to nontoxic latex heads, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, increased membrane-associated calcium, elevated free cytosolic calcium, and killed 50% to 60% of the cell population after 6 to 8 hours. To test whether disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential was sufficient to cause irreversible injury, P388D1 cells were exposed to either the proton ionophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) or to the mitochondrial inhibitor, antimycin A. Over 90% of the treated cells showed depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane as indicated by the fluorescent probe rhodamine 123. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylbydrazone also caused an elevation in free cytosolic calcium as monitored by fura-2. However, even after 6 hours of exposure to these proton ionophores or mitochondrial inhibitors, P388D1 cells did not show increased chlorotetracycline (CTC)-induced fluorescence or loss of viability. P388D1 cells exposed to silica have been shown previously to lose 80% of their adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. The effect of reduced ATP levels on intracellular calcium homeostasis and viability was assessed by exposing P338D1 cells to FCCP in the presence of sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose, which reduced ATP content by more than 90%. Under these conditions, none of the cells were killed, and only 5.5% showed increased CTC-induced fluorescence after 6 hours. These data indicate that disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, even in combination with reduced ATP content, is not sufficient to kill P388D1 cells.\r"

The liver specimens comprised a total of 20 biopsies with normal histology and biopsies with fibrosis or cirrhosis at different clinical stages and of heterogeneous origins. In normal liver, procollagen type I, III, and IV transcripts were detected in stromal and vascular mesenchymal cells of portal tracts and central veins, as well as in some perisinusoidal cells of the lobule. In fibrotic liver, increased levels of these procollagen mRNAs were observed in the same locations, and particularly enhanced in stromal cells of fibrotic septa and portal tracts, as well as in perisinusoidal cells. Expression of alpha 1 (IV) procollagen RNA was additionally found in some vascular endothelial and bile duct epithelial cells. Although previously suggested as the major source of liver collagens, hepatocytes showed no significant procollagen transcript levels in any of our samples. Thus, procollagen synthesis does not appear to be a function of hepatocytes, but rather of mesenchymal, endothelial, and bile duct epithelial cells in adult human liver. These findings may have implications for the development of specifically targeted antifibrotic therapies.\r"

  ".U": "90320789\r", 
  ".W": "The blood vessel wall's response to injury is an important determinant of luminal size and vessel function. The physiologic migration of endothelial cells from the edges of a wound and the pathophysiologic migration of medial smooth muscle cells into the intima are two important components of the vessel wall's response to injury. The influence of the angiotensin system on endothelial and smooth muscle cell migration have not been examined. In the present study, the influence of angiotensin system components on bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) and bovine aortic smooth muscle cell (BASMC) migration after release of cultured cell monolayers from contact inhibition was determined. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril increased BAEC migration 41% +/- 3% (P less than 0.001), as did the specific angiotensin II antagonist sar1, ile8-angiotensin II (SAR) (41% +/- 3% (P less than 0.001). Exogenous angiotensin I and angiotensin II did not affect BAEC migration. Exogenous angiotensin II abolished the effect of lisinopril on BAEC migration. Lisinopril increased cell-associated u-plasminogen activator (u-PA) 23% +/- 3% (P less than 0.001) in migrating BAEC and angiotensin II abolished this increase. SAR increased u-PA 33% +/- 0% (P less than 0.001). In contrast, these agents had the opposite effect on smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II increased smooth muscle cell migration 40% +/- 3% (P less than 0.001), and this effect was abolished by SAR. Angiotensin II also increased cell-associated u-PA 83% +/- 7% (P less than 0.001) in migrating BASMC. The increase in BAEC migration with inhibition of endothelial cell angiotensin II stimulation, either with lisinopril or SAR, also was associated with an increase in cell-associated u-PA. These results indicate that lisinopril interrupts an autocrine pathway in endothelial cells, in which endothelial cell-derived angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by ACE, and imply that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in vivo would act to reduce vessel wall injury by directly increasing the rate of endothelial cell wound closure; by increasing the antithrombotic tendency of the endothelium via enhanced u-PA; and indirectly, by decreasing production of angiotensin II and thereby the rate of smooth muscle cell migration into the intima.\r"

Pretreatment with SDZ 63.675 prevented the reduction of platelet counts in the blood obtained from the right ventricle (86.6 +/- 2.8% of the control preischemia value) and the transient bradycardia (85.0 +/- 2.8%), the systemic hypotension (58.0 +/- 2.8%), and the increase in right ventricular pressure (125.0 +/- 3.6%) that were evident in the first minutes of reperfusion in untreated control rabbits. Two as well as 24 hours after reperfusion, the infarct size, judged by staining with tetrazolium, was significantly reduced in rabbits treated with SDZ 63.675 (infarct size in control animals, 66.0 +/- 2.9% and 63.46 +/- 2.09% of the risk region at 2 or 24 hours, respectively, compared with 38.9 +/- 5.2% and 37.11 +/- 2.44% of the risk region at 2 and 24 hours in rabbits treated with SDZ 63.675). This result was confirmed by histologic examination of cardiac tissue 24 hours after reperfusion. In addition, SDZ 63.675 markedly reduced the accumulation of 111In-oxine-labeled platelets that occurs 15 minutes after reperfusion in the central ischemic area of the heart and in the lungs. These results suggest that PAF plays a role in the evolution of myocardial injury observed during reperfusion.\r"

Despite intensive studies dealing with the biochemistry and multiple biologic effects of bFGF, the cellular distribution is virtually unknown. Therefore, using the indirect immunoperoxidase technique, we examined the effect of bFGF on a large pattern of normal, inflammatory, and tumorous human tissues. Staining was performed on cryostat sections with a highly specific affinity-purified antiserum. In normal tissues, especially those of the thymus and placenta, mainly dendritic cells contained the growth factor. High levels of bFGF were also detected in basal cells and gland epithelial cells of skin biopsies. A conspicuous expression was observed in chronic inflammatory tissues corresponding to a generally pronounced proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells in these situations. Tumors revealed a very heterogenous staining pattern. In some lesions, bFGF was predominantly present in infiltrating and endothelial cells. In several, neoplasms tumor cells exhibited an intensive staining. In some, especially vascular tumors, bFGF could not be detected. From the staining results it is concluded that angiogenesis is not simply controlled by the presence of bFGF but is mediated by a balance of several angiogenic inducers and inhibitors.\r"

The diagnosis can be suspected by careful history and physical examination, but must be confirmed by the appropriate electrical studies.

Further diagnostic work-up and surgery may be necessary for those cases which fail to demonstrate satisfactory improvement in the expected time period.\r"

Successful treatment is dependent upon the ability to correctly identify the pathologic changes associated with a specific disorder and arrive at an accurate diagnosis. Labral abnormalities are traditionally associated with glenohumeral instability. Isolated labral tears or degenerative changes may also cause shoulder dysfunction. A reliable clinical tool to assess the status of the labrum would be useful for diagnosis and management of shoulder disorders. The magnetic resonance images of 48 shoulders that had subsequent surgical examination of their labra were reviewed with respect to labral appearance. Labra appearing as abnormal were further classified as torn, degenerative, or eroded. Surgical examination was used as the reference standard. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated high levels of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy for evaluation of the glenoid labrum. Magnetic resonance imaging is a reliable and accurate method for depicting the status of the glenoid labrum. Magnetic resonance imaging appearance of the labrum may assist the clinician in distinguishing the varying forms of shoulder dysfunction and facilitate diagnosis and effective treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to critically evaluate the results of 80 consecutive subacromial decompressions in 76 patients with impingement syndrome and to assess the value of arthroscopy for subacromial decompression. The average followup was 32 months. The charts, radiographs, and clinical findings of all patients were reviewed. There were 57 males and 19 females, with a mean age of 41 years. Subjective, objective, and functional results were assessed. The greatest improvement was seen in the areas of pain with activity, pain at night, and use of medications. Impingement signs had decreased significantly at final followup. The procedure allowed an early return to work and competitive athletics. Repeat surgery was necessary in eight cases: three full thickness rotator cuff repairs, two stabilization procedures, two open debridements, and one biceps tenodesis and excision of the distal clavicle. An important finding was the number of unsuspected diagnoses that were made during arthroscopy. Twelve patients had significant labral tears, seven patients had complete rotator cuff tears, four patients had biceps tendon fraying, and two patients had loose bodies in the glenohumeral joint. In most of these shoulders the intraarticular lesions would not have been diagnosed by open subacromial decompression. Radiographic evaluation suggested that the \"outlet view\" can be helpful in determining depth of bony resection and may be a prognostic indicator. Patients who underwent simple decompression rather than bony resection tended to be younger and had less Stage III impingement changes, and they generally had a slightly better final outcome. Patients who had compensation injuries generally had a poorer outcome. In reviewing our results, it appears that arthroscopic subacromial decompression can be a successful alternative to open decompression. The key to success for closed decompression is related to 1) accurate diagnosis, 2) selective treatment, 3) adequate bone resection when required, and 4) repair of full thickness rotator cuff tears in the active patient. Postoperative rehabilitation, which includes early range of motion, is critical.\r"

In order to evaluate muscle coordination under physiologic conditions, nine patients with arthroscopically verified total ACL ruptures were compared with nine control volunteers. This comparison was made from electromyograms of the thigh muscles and heel contact recordings made while walking on a treadmill. While walking on a horizontal level, the patient's muscle activity did not differ from controls, but when the knee load was increased by walking uphill, the hamstring muscles in patients were activated significantly earlier than among controls. It is proposed that an altered muscle coordination is probably essential in ACL deficient patients to secure knee stability. This study suggests a new approach to investigate the coordination of muscles under physiologic conditions in ACL deficient patients, and may guide rehabilitation programs in the future.\r"

Tendon grafts were placed in rabbit knees as free fragments or were attached to synovium. These studies show that tendon grafts, even without vascularization or stress, remain viable after intraarticular transfer. Vascularization produces a trend toward increased collagen synthesis, but statistical analysis suggests that control levels of collagen synthesis continue after tendon transfers into rabbit knees. Cyanogen bromide cleavage peptides showed appropriate collagen formed by unstressed autogenous tendon transplants removed from rabbit knees up to 2 years from transplantation. All tendon grafts degenerated initially, but began to form histologically healthy looking connective tissue by 18 to 24 weeks after transplantation. Overall, the results are encouraging with regard to the fate of intraarticular tendon grafts.\r"

Seventeen patients were skeletally mature and had large lesions (2 to 3 cm in diameter) of the medial femoral condyle that required surgery. Each of these patients, who underwent antegrade curettement, bone grafting, and pinning, had either failed a conservative program or had a loose or separated fragment. The average age at the time of surgery was 17. Followup ranged from 5 to 7 years. Postoperative evaluation included the criteria of the Hughston et al. rating scale, subjective assessment, clinical examination, and AP, lateral, and tunnel radiographs. According to the osteochondritis dissecans rating scale described by Hughston et al., there were two excellent, nine good, five fair, no poor results, and one failure. Additional evaluation, not included in the Hughston rating scale, consisted of Cybex II muscle strength testing, strict grading of preoperative and postoperative roentgenograms for degenerative changes, and magnetic resonance imaging. Roentgenograms demonstrated that 16 of the 17 lesions healed. The average healing time was 8 months. Preoperative degenerative changes occurred frequently; postoperatively, there was some progression of these changes in the majority of cases. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the articular surface was smooth in 57% of the knees and in 43% there was some degree of irregularity. Although the integrity of the articular cartilage could be documented, magnetic resonance imaging is of questionable value in the postoperative evaluation of this condition, because the status of the articular cartilage could not be correlated with the degree of degenerative changes or results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The biomechanical effectiveness of an extraarticular ACL reconstruction, an intraarticular ACL reconstruction, and the combination of these on both anterior stability and internal rotational stability of the ACL deficient knee was investigated in six cadaver knees. The extraarticular reconstruction consisted of the Muller anterolateral femorotibial ligament iliotibial band tenodesis, and the intraarticular reconstruction used the middle third of the patellar tendon in the manner of Clancy. The extraarticular reconstruction was found to overconstrain internal tibial rotation of the ACL excised knee between 30 degrees and 90 degrees (P less than 0.05). While the isolated extraarticular reconstruction did not return normal anterior stability to the ACL deficient knee (P less than 0.05), it did significantly reduce the anterior laxity of the ACL deficient knee between 30 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion (P less than 0.05). For the combined reconstruction, the intraarticular procedure was performed and then only enough tension was applied to the extraarticular reconstruction to take up slack in the tenodesis without shifting the rotatory position of the tibia from that produced by the intraarticular procedure alone. Neither the intraarticular reconstruction nor the combined procedure resulted in any significant shifts from normal (P less than 0.05) in the rotatory position of the unloaded tibia; during loading neither resulted in rotational displacements significantly different from normal; and both of these procedures reduced the increased anterior laxity of the ACL deficient knee to a level not statistically different from normal. Because the extraarticular reconstruction shared the load when performed with the intraarticular reconstruction as part of a combined procedure, we concluded that it would be useful as an adjunctive procedure in appropriate clinical situations.\r"

Five young athletes with hip pain secondary to osteoid osteoma are presented. The average age of the patients was 15 years old, with an average followup of 4 years. Radioisotope bone scans, computed axial tomograms, and linear tomograms were valuable diagnostic aids. All five athletes were treated with a limited excisional biopsy via an anterior approach to the femoral neck. Associated treatment modalities, such as bone grafting, internal fixation, and cast immobilization, were not necessary. There were no major complications. The five young athletes returned to sports at an average of 4 months postoperatively. Osteoid osteoma of the femoral neck should be included in the differential diagnosis of hip pain in young athletes. A limited excisional biopsy provided a rapid return to sports for the young athlete without the potential morbidity associated with internal fixation, bone grafting, and cast immobilization.\r"

  ".W": "In 1987, during two great skating contests--the Universiade in the Tatra Mountains and the Gold Pirouette in Zagreb--a total of 42 world class skaters were asked through a questionnaire if they had ever in their career suffered from a stress fracture. Of the 42 skaters, 9 had stress fractures. Four stress fractures occurred during preseason training (two fibular, one second metatarsal, and two fourth metatarsal stress fractures). Increased mileage was reported by three skaters and the fourth had done too much speed training on hills. Five stress fractures occurred during the season (one tibial and two tarsal navicular stress fractures and two stress fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal). In all cases, the fracture occurred in the take-off leg. All of the subjects were competitive figure skaters with a daily training period of 3 to 8 hours, six times a week. The time from the onset of symptoms to definite diagnosis ranged from 2 to 10 weeks. Of the nine injured skaters, eight were treated conservatively and one skater with Jones' fracture was treated surgically. All of the skaters were able to resume a preinjury level of activity 3 to 7 months after treatment began. In conclusion, it may be emphasized that stress fractures in figure skaters are not rare and should, therefore, always be considered as a possibility.\r"

Eighty-three percent reported their initial injury on artificial turf (P less than 0.05). Other factors significantly related to the incidence of turf-toe included player age (P less than 0.01), number of years in professional football (P less than 0.01), and range of ankle dorsiflexion (P less than 0.05). Turf-toe injury resulted in significantly decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (P less than 0.01).\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine how much turnout is necessary for maximal abduction. It was hypothesized that moderate turnout is sufficient for this purpose. Twenty-two professional dancers from the Alberta Ballet Company were studied. Measurements of passive hip abduction were taken at 0 degree, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 70 degrees, 80 degrees, 90 degrees and maximum hip lateral rotation using a goniometer and Leighton flexometer. Statistical analysis was done using Pearson correlation coefficients. A significant positive correlation was found between abduction and lateral rotation (P less than 0.05). The greater the position of external rotation, the more abduction achieved. In conclusion, the traditional emphasis on good turnout has some scientific merit and functional implications.\r"

Of 800 patients who underwent intraarticular ACL patellar tendon-bone graft reconstruction, performed by the same surgeon, the last 450 patients have followed the accelerated rehabilitation schedule as outlined in the protocol. A longer than 2 year followup is recorded for 73 of the patients in the accelerated rehabilitation group. On the 1st postoperative day, we encouraged these patients to walk with full weightbearing and full knee extension. By the 2nd postoperative week, the patients with a 100 degree range of motion participated in a guided exercise and strengthening program. By the 4th week, patients were permitted unlimited activities of daily living and were allowed to return to light sports activities as early as the 8th week if the Cybex strength scores of the involved extremity exceeded 70% of the scores of the noninvolved extremity and the patient had completed a sport-specific functional/agility program. The patient database was compiled from frequent clinical examinations, periodic knee questionnaires, and objective information, such as range of motion measurements, KT-1000 values, and Cybex strength scores. A series of graft biopsies obtained at various times have revealed no adverse histologic reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Most muscle stretching studies have focused on defining the biomechanical properties of isolated elements of the muscle-tendon unit or on comparing different stretching techniques. We developed an experimental model that was designed to evaluate clinically relevant biomechanical stretching properties in an entire muscle-tendon unit. Our objectives were to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of the muscle-tendon unit and to consider the clinical applications of these viscoelastic properties. Rabbit extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior muscle-tendon units were evaluated using methods designed to simulate widely used stretching techniques. Additionally, the effects of varying stretch rates and of reflex influences were evaluated. We found that muscle-tendon units respond viscoelastically to tensile loads. Reflex activity did not influence the biomechanical characteristics of the muscle-tendon unit in this model. Experimental techniques simulating cyclic stretching and static stretching resulted in sustained muscle-tendon unit elongations, suggesting that greater flexibility can result if these techniques are used in the clinical setting. With repetitive stretching, we found that after four stretches there was little alteration of the muscle-tendon unit, implying that a minimum number of stretches will lead to most of the elongation in repetitive stretching. Also, greater peak tensions and greater energy absorptions occurred at faster stretch rates, suggesting that the risk of injury in a stretching regimen may be related to the stretch rate, and not to the actual technique. All of these clinically important considerations can be related to the viscoelastic characteristics of the muscle-tendon unit.\r"

The participants in the study were 1396 cadets at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York, who experienced a total of 21,570 athlete-exposures in the 1986 and 1987 fall intramural tackle football seasons. The use of prophylactic knee braces significantly reduced the frequency of knee injuries, both in the total number of subjects injured and in the total number of medial collateral ligament injuries incurred. However, the reduction in the frequency of knee injuries (total and medial collateral ligament) was dependent on player position. Defensive players who wore prophylactic knee braces had statistically fewer knee injuries than players who served as controls. This was not true of offensive players who served as controls; they had statistically no difference in the number of knee injuries from players who wore prophylactic knee braces. The severity of medical collateral ligament and anterior cruciate ligament knee injuries was not significantly reduced with the use of prophylactic knee braces.\r"

Microscopic examination revealed zones of thermal damage extending 550 microns from ablation sites. Ablation rates were measured with a mass loss technique. Above threshold, mass removal rates were proportional to laser radiant exposure. Threshold radiant exposure for ablation was 50 J/cm2 for articular cartilage and 11 J/cm2 for meniscal fibrocartilage. Because the holmium laser can precisely and rapidly resect cartilaginous tissues with only moderate necrosis, function in a saline environment in direct contact with tissue, and be transmitted through conventional optical fibers, it has the potential to become a useful tool for the precise arthroscopic removal of intraarticular tissue.\r"

Prevalences among primary school students (5-10 years of age) of G. lamblia (38%), Endolimax nana (43%), and Entamoeba coli (25%) were overall higher than among nursery school students (3 months-5 years of age; prevalences 29%, 21%, and 16%, respectively). There was no apparent association between socio-economic intake and levels of G. lamblia infection: the private nursery school had the highest recorded level of infection (40%). One hundred sixty-two triplicate stool specimens were used to compare microscopy with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of Giardia fecal antigens. The ELISA was highly sensitive and specific either visually (95% and 97%, respectively) or by optical density determination (99% and 96%, respectively). Incorporation of non-immune rabbit immunoglobulin-coated control wells did not enhance sensitivity and specificity. The antigen detection ELISA is an extremely effective tool for the epidemiological investigation of giardiasis.\r"

In the arid, northern half of the country (tropical climatic zone), where both intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis are hyperendemic, Biomphalaria pfeifferi was the only Schistosoma mansoni host and Bulinus globusus and B. senegalensis the most common S. haematobium hosts. In that region, these snails occurred almost exclusively in temporary bodies of water. Taking into account results from a companion study on the distribution of schistosomiasis in humans, our results clearly show that temporary water bodies in the tropical zone are the principal foci of transmission. These findings disagree with commonly held views about schistosome transmission in Cameroon. B. truncatus, a S. haematobium host, was also present in the tropical zone but was found principally in perennial habitats. Although some perennial habitats were important transmission sites, they represent only a small portion of the overall problem. B. truncatus is the principal S. haematobium host in the wetter southern half of the country where schistosomiasis haematobium is highly focal. Biom. camerunensis was far more common than Biom. pfeifferi in the South but did not occur where S. mansoni prevalence rates were high; thus it appears to be a poor host. B. forskalii, the sole host of S. intercalatum in Cameroon, occurs widely throughout the country; however, the schistosome is restricted to a small region in the South.\r"

Treatment with itraconazole or SCH39304 significantly reduced lesion sizes as compared with controls. There were no differences between the 2 drugs at the dosages used. Histopathologically, lesions of mice treated with either drug had less inflammation with fewer fungi and more diffuse fibrosis than controls. Electron microscopy showed damage to the fungal cell walls in mice treated with itraconazole or SCH39304, characterized by gaps, fragmentation, and delamination.

However, the efficacy of IV verapamil in the management of \"rate-related\" hypotension has not been specifically addressed. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of IV verapamil in patients with SVTs and arterial hypotension. A retrospective and prospective study design was used. Inclusion criteria were SVT (QRS duration, less than 120 ms; R-R interval, regular or irregular), QRS rate of 140 or more, systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less, and normal mental status. We identified 21 episodes of SVT meeting inclusion criteria in 19 patients. SVT was due to atrioventricular node re-entry in 17, atrial fibrillation in three, and atrial flutter in one. There were seven men and 12 women, with a mean age (+/- SD) of 52 +/- 17 years. Systolic blood pressure before verapamil was 70 +/- 28 mm Hg, and QRS rate was 192 +/- 19. IV calcium was not administered before IV verapamil. After IV verapamil administration (mean dose, 6.5 +/- 4.3 mg), a positive response (conversion to sinus rhythm or ventricular rate of less than 120) was noted in 17 of 21 episodes (80%). Post-treatment systolic blood pressure increased to 98 +/- 16 mm Hg (P less than .005 vs pretreatment), and ventricular response rate decreased to 112 +/- 39 (P less than .001 by two-tailed paired t test).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a retrospective study of 262 malpractice claims against emergency physicians insured in Massachusetts by the state-mandated insurance carrier; these 262 claims were closed in the years 1980 through 1987. A total of $11,800,156 in indemnity and expenses was spent for these 262 claims. In 211 cases, the allegation was failure to diagnose a medical or surgical problem. One hundred eighty-four of these cases were included in the following eight diagnostic categories: chest pain, abdominal pain, wounds, fractures, pediatric fever/meningitis, aortic aneurysm, central nervous system bleeding, and epiglottitis. These eight categories accounted for 66.44% of the total dollars spent for the 262 claims. Because of the high incidence and dollar losses attached to these eight diagnostic categories, the Massachusetts Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians (MACEP) has developed clinical guidelines for the evaluation of these high-risk areas. Of the 184 high-risk claims, 99 claim files were reviewed; 45 of these reviewed claims were judged by physician reviewers as preventable by the application of the MACEP high risk clinical guidelines. From 22.26% to 46.4% of the $11,800,156 spent on the 262 claims could have been saved by the application of the MACEP clinical guidelines.\r"

To investigate the effectiveness of CPB reperfusion in an ischemic cardiac arrest setting, simulating the clinical scenario of myocardial ischemia preceding sudden cardiac death, we developed a canine model of acute myocardial infarction followed by ventricular fibrillation. Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to two groups. Group 1 (eight) had ventricular fibrillation induced without left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Group 2 (eight) had a thrombogenic copper coil placed in the left anterior descending artery and showed ECG evidence of acute myocardial infarction before induction of ventricular fibrillation. CPR commenced after eight minutes of ventricular fibrillation. Epinephrine 0.05 mg/kg and NaHCO3 1.0 mEq/kg were administered at ten minutes. CPB was begun at 12 minutes and continued for one hour. Myocardial ischemic and necrotic areas were determined in four-hour survivors by dual histochemical staining. All animals were resuscitated; all eight group 1 and six of eight group 2 animals survived to four hours. With the onset of CPB, coronary perfusion pressures increased significantly by 68.6 +/- 31.8 (SD) mm Hg in group 1 and 56.2 +/- 34.6 mm Hg in group 2 over those obtained with CPR (P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of BCPR in an animal model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Ten swine were instrumented for hemodynamic and regional blood flow measurements with tracer microspheres. After two minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF), the animals received eight minutes of either BCPR (five) or no-bystander CPR (NBCPR; five). Defibrillation was then attempted in both groups. If unsuccessful, CPR was begun and epinephrine 0.02 mg/kg was administered. Defibrillation was attempted again three and one-half minutes after epinephrine administration. Regional myocardial and cerebral blood flows were measured 30 seconds and five and one-half minutes after initiation of BCPR and one minute after epinephrine administration. In the BCPR group, myocardial blood flow was initially 29.0 +/- 33.2 and decreased to 15.0 +/- 21.5 mL/min/100 g during the last two and one-half minutes of BCPR. Cortical cerebral blood flow was initially 2.0 +/- 2.8 and fell to 0.6 +/- 0.8 mL/min/100 g during the last two and one-half minutes of BCPR. There were no statistical differences in myocardial blood flow and cerebral blood flow between the initial or late stages of BCPR (P greater than .14). There were no statistical differences in myocardial blood flow and cerebral blood flow between BCPR and NBCPR groups after epinephrine administration (P greater than .09).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study compared cardiovascular resuscitability with CPB only after varying periods of cardiac arrest without artificial circulatory support in a canine model. Group 1 (ten) was subjected to ventricular fibrillation for 15 minutes; group 2 (ten) for 20 minutes; and group 3 (ten) for 30 minutes. All received total CPB after ventricular fibrillation without advanced cardiac life support to defibrillation at two to five minutes and partial CPB to four hours. In all three groups CPB with epinephrine generated normal coronary perfusion pressure and increased ventricular fibrillation amplitude significantly. In groups 1 and 2, CPB reperfusion allowed for successful defibrillation in less than five minutes, weaning from CPB in all dogs at four hours, and stable spontaneous circulation thereafter. In group 3, only five of ten dogs could be weaned from bypass at four hours, and all died early with myocardial necroses. It was concluded that CPB may be of value in the setting of prolonged cardiac arrest when advanced cardiac life support has not been provided or is unable to restore spontaneous heart-beat.\r"

  ".W": "A major earthquake devastated the Armenian Republic of the Soviet Union on December 7, 1988, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries. In a postearthquake investigation of three towns seriously affected by the earthquake, we studied earthquake-related injury patterns, made observations on rescue and medical efforts, and postulated certain factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Information was obtained from official Soviet documents, interviews with survivors of the earthquake, and interviews with local, regional, and national government officials. Figures were based on assessments made by these officials in the field in the immediate postearthquake period. Out of a population of 8,500, there were 4,202 (49.4%) deaths and 1,244 (14.6%) injured (casualty rate, 64.0%). Deaths and injuries were 67 and 11 times higher, respectively, among trapped than nontrapped victims. Being outside at the time of the earthquake or having escaped to the outside from the collapsing structure was crucial for survival. Among persons found alive, 89% were rescued during the first 24 hours, mostly without the use of heavy equipment. This observation underscores the importance of swift rescuer response. As with all field surveys after disasters, there were methodological limitations to this study due to chaotic postearthquake conditions. Accordingly, results must be approached with caution. Nonetheless, these preliminary observations are striking and have generated several new hypotheses for further investigations using more sophisticated analytic methods.\r"

A constant search for greater efficiency prompted the development of a computer simulation model to analyze the current EMS system operated by the Tucson Fire Department and to provide statistical information on the effects of potential vehicle base locations on system performance. The simulation model generates data that reflect a variety of parameters necessary in base location analysis. Included in the performance statistics for each unit and for the entire system are indicators of unit use rates, minimum and maximum response times, and proportion of calls reached within the critical response time of eight minutes or less. The model has been carefully validated and used in unit redeployment and unit activation in Tucson, Arizona.\r"

The prevalence of naloxone-induced vomiting, seizures, hypotension, hypertension, and cardiac arrest was sought from the prehospital records of 813 patients treated during a 12-month period. The mean age of the treated patients was 42.4 +/- 9.7 years. The initial dose of naloxone was 0.4 to 0.8 mg, and the mean total dose was 0.9 +/- 0.6 mg. No patients lost a pulse within ten minutes of receiving naloxone. Two patients (0.2%) experienced a significant drop in systolic blood pressure, and one patient (0.1%) demonstrated a significant rise in systolic blood pressure within five minutes of naloxone administration. Vomiting occurred in two patients (0.2%), and one patient (0.1%) suffered a tonic-clonic seizure within five minutes of naloxone administration. Of the 813 patients treated, 60 patients (7.4%: mean age, 32.3 +/- 6.7 years) were judged to have an improved LOC after naloxone, with 27 (3.3%) regaining a normal LOC. We conclude that in the above doses, naloxone is safe as part of prehospital protocols for paramedics treating patients with an acutely depressed LOC. However, the vast majority of patients treated empirically with naloxone in the field demonstrated no benefit.\r"

Such concern may discourage the development of regional medical control systems. During the first six months of 1988, a retrospective cross-sectional analysis was made of all advanced life support (ALS) ambulance transports and all contacts to the single base station, known as Medical Resource Hospital (MRH). Destinations of all ALS ambulance calls dispatched through the county's 911 dispatch center were analyzed to determine whether the destinations were affected by MRH contact. There were 12,396 transports to 17 area hospitals with 1,272 (10.3%) of these requiring MRH contact. We hypothesized that if MRH contact did not affect destination, the proportion of all non-MRH ALS ambulance patients received by each hospital from the 911-dispatched group would equal the proportion of patients received by each hospital after MRH contact. Five hospitals received a statistically significant (P less than .003) different percentage of MRH contact patients than their proportion of 911-dispatched patients would have predicted. The three that received more were community hospitals in outlying areas. The remaining two were a large referral hospital and a smaller community hospital located in the urban area. The MRH hospital did not have a significantly different percentage of 911-dispatched patients after MRH contact. Similarly, destinations of specific ALS ambulances (two serving in the MRH ambulance catchment area and four in distant catchment areas) were evaluated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied two nitrous oxide scavenging devices and their effect on ambient levels of nitrous oxide in the patient compartment of a stationary ambulance. We compared the ambient levels of gas when nitrous oxide scavenging was in use versus when it was not. In addition, we evaluated the effect of two different mask designs on ambient levels of nitrous oxide. With eight healthy male volunteers acting as their own controls using a series of mask/scavenger combinations, we found that there was a significant difference in the ambient levels of nitrous oxide when a scavenger was in use. The mean time-weighted average was 776 parts per million/min when no scavenger was used. When gas scavenging was in use, the mean time-weighted average never exceeded 150 parts per million/min. (P less than .0001). There was no significant difference between nitrous oxide scavengers or between the masks tested in their effect on nitrous oxide ambient levels in the atmosphere. We conclude that nitrous oxide scavengers are effective in lowering nitrous oxide ambient levels in the prehospital setting and merit consideration as adjuncts to nitrous oxide delivery systems in this setting.\r"

A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients transported from southeast Alaska to Seattle, Washington, by an intensive care air ambulance over a five-year period (1982-1986). During the study period, 442 patients were transported an average one-way distance of 703 +/- 58.9 miles. Of these, 134 had a diagnosis of major or multiple trauma and were the focus of the study. Patient demographics and medical stabilization by Alaskan physicians, the flight team, and the receiving hospital were analyzed. Injury severity and outcomes also were evaluated. Of the study group, 31% required air transport within Alaska before being seen by a physician. The flight team provided major stabilization for 11% of the trauma victims, minor stabilization for 42%, and no further stabilization for 47%. Patient flights were categorized using previously published criteria as \"essential\" to survival in 27% of the cases, \"helpful\" in 55%, and \"noncontributory\" in 18%. This study presents a profile of patients injured in remote areas who require stabilization by rural, often nonsurgical physicians and face long-distance transfers before reaching definitive care. Health-care systems in sparsely populated areas may use this study as a reference for comparing trauma outcomes and quality of care in long-distance air transport.\r"

The program objectives are to use the experience of senior clinical faculty to help students realize how the information and concepts they learn are important in the practice of medicine, to help with understanding clinical decision making, to provide unique feedback to the faculty and administration on the curriculum and quality of teaching, and to have respected senior faculty serve as advocates for incorporating current education concepts into the medical education program. The mentors have no preset agenda or procedures to accomplish these objectives; each uses his or her own style and interests. Reaction to the program from all parties has been highly favorable: students have been enthusiastic about their encounters with the mentors; the mentors have experienced a new lease on life; and the medical school administration has continued the program as a way of implementing the GPEP recommendation that deans and department chairmen exhibit their commitment to education by their own attitudes and actions.\r"

All the programs responded. On average, the internal medicine programs had more geriatrics faculty than did the family practice faculty, but these numbers were insufficient to meet current or future needs. Fewer than half of the residencies had geriatrics inpatient or ambulatory-care evaluation units, geriatrics consult services, geropsychiatry wards, or geriatrics clinics available as training sites. In contrast, nursing homes were available for 93% of the family practice programs and 58% of the internal medicine programs. A total of 80% of the family practice programs but only 36% of the internal medicine programs had geriatrics curricula in place. The authors conclude that integration of geriatrics content into residency training is far from universal, largely because of a shortage of faculty and clinical training sites.\r"

A total of 610 (91%) of the students who entered Jefferson Medical College between 1985 and 1987 were the study sample. Fifty-eight of these students had taken nondegree undergraduate premedical courses and 15 had taken nondegree graduate courses. Fourteen students held graduate degrees and 60 students had some combination of the aforementioned types of postbaccalaureate preparations. The other 463 students had not taken postbaccalaureate courses. Grades received in medical school courses such as anatomy, biochemistry, mechanisms of disease, physiology, microbiology, pathology, and pharmacology, as well as total scores on Part I of the National Board of Medical Examiners examination were selected as performance variables. Statistical analyses showed that the students who had taken nondegree postbaccalaureate courses had lower undergraduate grade-point averages than those without such courses and received lower grades on some measures of performance in medical school. The students with such additional academic backgrounds were also older than the average medical student. When adjustments were made for undergraduate grade-point averages by applying analysis of covariance, the observed differences that favored the group without postbaccalaureate preparation either became nonsignificant or favored those with such preparation. The differences favoring those without postbaccalaureate preparation could be accounted for mostly by these students' higher undergraduate grade-point averages and younger ages. Implications for admission decisions with regard to the changing applicant pool are discussed.\r"

Repeating the same examination permitted investigation of the predictive and construct validities of the clinical skills tests, as well as the stability of the validity and high reliability estimates that emerged from the testing of the first cohort. The results provide convincing evidence of the testing approach's predictive and construct validity and reliability.\r"

The data provided strong support for this distinction, with the scores on learning-style measures correlating as expected. The relationships between the students' inventory scores and their scores on two measures of academic performance were also examined. Correlations between measures of learning style and academic performance yielded low, nonsignificant positive correlations and were found to be inadequate predictors of academic performance. Implications and possible explanations for these findings are discussed.\r"

Interview data were collected in 1981 from 200 patients prior to their visits with the doctor. Patients were asked, \"How do you hope the doctor (or clinic) can be of help to you today?\" Their responses were written down verbatim. A coding system was devised that described the specificity, focus, and form of each request in order to provide the clinician with a classification for recognizing these request elements and responding to them. Specificity (precision) was identified from the response to \"What do you hope the doctor will do for you?\" The focus (objective) was described by four categories: problem, treatment, relationship, and administration; the form (intervention), by five categories: somatic, cognitive, affective, advice, and instrumental. Patterns of requests differed in the two settings. In the WIU, the pattern of requests had a problem focus with a form split between the cognitive (wanting an explanation) and the somatic (wanting a medical procedure); in the GMP, treatment was the focus, with a somatic form. The overall results indicate the varied requests of medical outpatients that express their perspectives about their illnesses. This classification of requests should be useful to physicians in eliciting and responding to their patients' requests.\r"

Some studies have suggested that unless women have unusual ability or achievements, they should expect to be treated inequitably. The current study was designed to explore any relationships between the questions asked in the interview and the gender of the applicant. The women were more frequently asked about their plans for marriage and children, while the men were more often questioned about their reasons for entering medicine or selection of a specialty. The interviewees believed they could give more honest responses to interviewers of the same gender.\r"

The authors document a rapid increase in the number of such relationships in the latter half of the 1980s and suggest that this trend is comparable to the increase in formal relationships with nursing homes begun by academic health centers in the early 1980s. Issues raised by those institutions that responded are presented, levels of possible involvement with a CCRC are described, and the contractual agreement between the University of North Carolina School of Medicine's Program on Aging and a local CCRC is presented as an example of the benefits that can be gained from such a relationship.\r"

The diagnosis was based on the presence of a distinct clinical syndrome with progressive flaccid paraparesis, preserved proprioception and urinary retention with specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Ganciclovir therapy, 5-10 mg/kg per day, instituted 3-6.5 weeks after onset of symptoms, was ineffective in four patients with severe paraparesis. One patient developed CMV polyradiculomyelitis while receiving ganciclovir and further deteriorated during foscarnet therapy. One patient however, showing minor paresis of one leg, improved after institution of ganciclovir therapy 1 week after onset of symptoms. It is concluded that a presumptive diagnosis of CMV polyradiculomyelitis can be made on the basis of distinct clinical findings and CSF pleocytosis with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in patients with AIDS. Ganciclovir therapy does not appear to be beneficial for patients with advanced paresis in the doses used. Further investigations are needed in order to determine if early intervention with ganciclovir, when paresis is mild, or higher doses in advanced paresis, might be of some benefit.\r"

Sixteen subjects with AIDS-related complex were treated for 4-66 weeks with stepwise increasing oral doses of rifabutin from 300 to 2400 mg/day. The highest dose attained was twice that previously reported for humans. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of drug were detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography. A reversible syndrome of arthritis/arthralgia, not previously described, was seen in most (nine out of 10) of those given doses exceeding 1050 mg/day. Uveitis and aphthous stomatitis developed at doses of approximately 1800 mg in two of those with joint manifestations. Typical manifestations of Reiter's syndrome were not seen in any patient. An orange-tan skin pigmentation was almost universal. Other toxicities resembled those previously associated with rifampin.

  ".W": "In late 1988, a cross-sectional study of 1715 adult medical patients hospitalized in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, west Africa, showed an overall prevalence of HIV infection of 46% in men and 28% in women. On the basis of specific testing by whole virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot and synthetic peptide ELISA, HIV-1 infection was found in 25%, HIV-2 infection in 4%, and reactivity to both viruses in 11% of male and female patients combined. People infected with HIV-2, as well as those who were reactive to both HIV-1 and HIV-2, had a frequency of AIDS-associated symptoms and signs similar to that in HIV-1-infected patients, and significantly greater than that in seronegative patients. The significance of dual reactivity, and the natural history and disease spectrum of HIV-2 infection, require further study. Synthetic peptide ELISA is valuable for specific serodiagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections. Advanced HIV-2 infection in hospitalized patients in Abidjan is associated with the same symptoms and signs as HIV-1 infection.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the potential role of intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in Amsterdam in the heterosexual transmission of HIV, we studied the sexual behaviour of 243 male and female IVDUs with regard to their private ('steady' and 'casual') and commercial partners. The majority of the study group appear heterosexually active, especially female IVDUs, who often have commercial as well as one or more private partners. Vaginal contact is the most frequent method of sexual contact; condoms are used infrequently with private partners but much more frequently with commercial partners. A history of sexually transmitted disease is common, not only among IVDU prostitutes but also among IVDUs without a history of prostitution. IVDUs who know that they are HIV-infected reported fewer commercial partners and more frequent condom use with private partners than IVDUs who are negative or do not know their test result. We conclude that IVDUs may form an important source for heterosexual transmission of HIV. Voluntary testing of IVDUs on a large scale, together with intensive counselling, may slow down the further spread of HIV from infected IVDUs to their private and commercial partners, but is unlikely to stop heterosexual transmission completely.\r"

Pulsed-wave Doppler interrogation of the left ventricular outflow tract, in a prospective consecutive series (n = 137), revealed the presence of end-diastolic forward flow in 83% of the patients studied. Further quantification of both flow signals was performed in 67 patients. Pulsed-wave mapping demonstrated that peak velocity of the end-diastolic left ventricular outflow tract signal (J wave) was maximal, 2.6 +/- 0.7 cm from the aortic valve anulus, and occurred 48 +/- 34 milliseconds after the peak transmitral atrial velocity flow signal. Peak J velocity ranged from 25 to 118 cm per second and correlated with peak A velocity (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001). Peak J velocity was inversely related to left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (r = -0.53, p less than 0.0001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (r = -0.43, p less than 0.004). There was no relationship between J wave velocity and early diastolic filling. We concluded that a late-diastolic forward flow signal is commonly observed in the left ventricular outflow tract. It is a manifestation of transmitral atrial systolic flow in the left ventricular outflow tract and is determined predominantly by peak transmitral atrial velocity and left ventricular size.\r"

  ".W": "In 128 patients with apparently normally functioning prosthetic valves (n = 136) in the aortic position (n = 79) and the mitral position (n = 57), the prevalence of transprosthetic regurgitant flow was studied by use of transthoracic and transesophageal two-dimensional color-coded Doppler echocardiography. With the transthoracic approach, regurgitant flow was detected in early systole or diastole for 28% of the mitral prostheses and for 29% of the aortic prostheses. With transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography, regurgitant jets were visualized for 95% of the mitral prostheses and for 44% of the aortic prostheses. In 40% of the Bjork-Shiley prostheses and 88% of the St. Jude Medical prostheses in the mitral position, more than one jet with an eccentric origin was detected, whereas in bioprostheses only one centrally localized regurgitant jet was noted. The regurgitant jet length was 22 +/- 2 mm in mitral prostheses and 12 +/- 2 mm in aortic prostheses. The jet area was 154 +/- 31 mm2 in mitral prostheses and 61 +/- 26 mm2 in aortic prostheses. Jets of this size and frequency have to be considered a normal finding and the equivalent of regurgitant flow known from in vitro studies. We conclude that only transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography seems to be a reliable method for following up mitral valve prostheses to detect and differentiate regurgitant jets. For aortic valve prostheses the advantage of transesophageal color-coded Doppler echocardiography does not seem to be as obvious as the advantage for mitral prostheses.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities in left ventricular diastolic function or filling are considered to be responsible for some of the symptoms in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To clarify whether the abnormalities in left ventricular diastolic filling are improved by septal myectomy, 13 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and intracavitary pressure gradient were studied preoperatively and postoperatively by use of pulsed Doppler echocardiography. Peak early diastolic filling velocity (E), the ratio of peak early diastolic filling to peak atrial filling velocities (E/A ratio), and deceleration time were measured from the transmitral flow velocity pattern before and after septal myectomy. Although E and E/A ratio did not change after septal myectomy, deceleration time significantly shortened from 314 +/- 72 to 271 +/- 53 milliseconds (n = 10; p less than 0.05). Further, if seven patients with significant changes in heart rate (greater than 30%) or in the Doppler-determined severity of mitral regurgitation (more than one degree) were excluded (because these parameters may effect E and E/A ratio), there were also significant changes in E (81 +/- 21 versus 98 +/- 25 cm/sec, p less than 0.05) and in E/A ratio (0.84 +/- 0.17 versus 1.14 +/- 0.33, p less than 0.05). Because left ventricular systolic function has been demonstrated to remain constant or to decrease by most measures after septal myectomy, relief of some symptoms may be largely the result of the improvement in diastolic filling suggested by these criteria.\r"

The purpose of the study was to assess the suitability of instruments in common use for present day practice. It was found that the measurements differed significantly from the original descriptions and there were wide variations between instruments of the same type, even when supplied by the same manufacturer. In some cases the blades had not been packed in matching pairs in the Central Sterile Supplies Department. It is suggested that critical reappraisal of the forceps in current use in many obstetric units is overdue.

The major groups involved antepartum deaths of unknown cause (40%), and deaths due to intrapartum anoxia or trauma (35%). A case-control study compared each of the 75 cases with two controls matched for place of birth, obtained by taking the next two babies born in the same maternity unit (excluding perinatal deaths, birthweight less than 2.5 kg, and malformations). Four factors were found to be significantly associated with risk of perinatal death in this group: primigravidity, parity greater than or equal to 3, not booked for antenatal care by 20 weeks, and corrected birthweight less than 3.2 kg (adjusted for gestation). Two further factors were related only to the risk of perinatal death consequent upon intrapartum events: labour post-term and malpresentation in labour. All four factors relevant to the whole group remained independently associated with risk of perinatal death after multivariate analysis by two techniques. Adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) were estimated as: primigravidity 2.1 (1.1 to 4.1); parity three or more 5.7 (1.9 to 17); not booked for antenatal care by 20 weeks 15.7 (3.0 to 81); and corrected birthweight less than 3.25 kg 2.5 (1.3 to 4.6). An avoidable factor, as defined, was detected in 50% of deaths. In 30% of deaths there was an avoidable factor (grade 2) such that absence may have been expected to lead to a different outcome had all other factors remained equal. Of the avoidable factors detected, 61% related to intrapartum management, as did 76% of the grade 2 factors. Most of these involved failure to respond to evidence of fetal distress in labour. The defined group constituted 21% of all perinatal deaths, suggesting that this is an important category, particularly as their potential for normal survival should otherwise have been high.\r"

DESIGN--Measurement of bone mineral density of the radius by single photon absorptiometry and of the lumbar spine and hip by dual photon absorptiometry to assess their relation with various determinants of bone mineral density. Dietary calcium was assessed from a questionnaire validated against a four day dietary record. SETTING--Local community, Sydney, Australia. PATIENTS--48 Men (aged 21-79, median 44) recruited from the local community including 35 male cotwins of twin pairs of differing sex recruited from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council twin registry for epidemiological studies on determinants of bone mineral density. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Bone mineral density of the axial and appendicular skeleton and its relation to age, anthropometric features, dietary calcium intake, and serum sex hormone concentrations. RESULTS--Dietary calcium intake (g/day) was a significant predictor of bone mineral density of axial bones, explaining 24% and 42% of the variance at the lumbar spine and femoral neck respectively. This effect was independent of weight. In contrast with the axial skeleton, bone mineral density at each forearm site was predicted by weight and an index of free testosterone but not by dietary calcium intake. CONCLUSIONS--Dietary calcium intake has a role in the determination or maintenance, or both, of the axial but not the appendicular skeleton in adult men.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To identify the causes of obstetric accidents. DESIGN AND SETTING--Analysis of case records at the Medical Protection Society's London office covering the five years 1982-6. SUBJECTS--Cases that had come to litigation which had resulted in stillbirth, perinatal or neonatal death, central nervous system damage to the baby, or maternal death and in which there was an opinion from a senior obstetrician consulted by the society. Of 147 cases reviewed, 64 met the criteria for the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The principal findings of the expert reviewers. RESULTS--Three major topics of concern emerged common to most of the 64 cases. These were inadequate fetal heart monitoring, mismanagement of forceps, and inadequate supervision by senior staff. In 11 of the 64 cases cardiotocography was omitted, in 19 cases the trace was missing, in six cases the trace was unreadable, and in 14 of the remaining 28 cases signs of fetal distress went unnoticed or were ignored. In 31 cases forceps were used to aid delivery or were tried and abandoned in favour of caesarean section. In 16 cases two or more attempts to use forceps were made. Five infant deaths were directly attributed to mismanaged forceps. In 20 cases senior staff were criticised by the expert reviewer for failure to come to the labour ward. In many of these cases they may have given advice over the telephone, but the inadequacy of records made it impossible to tell. In these cases the labour and birth were managed by junior staff, usually a senior house officer. In six cases when senior staff did come they suggested that no action was needed. CONCLUSION--These few cases should not be dismissed as isolated incidents in obstetric practice in Britain. They reflect more general problems--namely, concerning the ability of junior doctors to interpret fetal heart traces accurately, their ability to use forceps, and the participation of senior staff in running a labour ward and delivery suite.\r"

DESIGN--A questionnaire was administered to parents who volunteered their children for a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of a drug to treat asthma and to a control group of parents whose children were eligible for the trial but had refused the invitation. SETTING--A children's hospital in Australia. SUBJECTS--68 Parents who had volunteered their children and 42 who had not; a response rate of 94% and 70%, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Responses of parents to questionnaire designed to assess their perceptions, attitudes, and health seeking behaviour as well as sociodemographic data. RESULTS--Volunteering parents were less well educated with only 15% (10/68) of mothers and 16% (11/68) and of fathers having had a tertiary or university education compared with 26% (11/42) of mothers and 45% (19/42) in the non-volunteering group. Fewer volunteering parents had professional or administrative jobs than did non-volunteering parents (mothers 6% (4/68); fathers 9% (6/68) v mothers 14% (6/42); fathers 31% (13/42)). Volunteering parents had less social support, and they displayed greater health seeking behaviour and consumed more habit forming substances. They were motivated by a desire to help others and to contribute to medical research, but they were also searching for more information and better ways to help their own children. CONCLUSION--Parents who volunteer their children for medical research are significantly more socially disadvantaged and emotionally vulnerable.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study a group of injecting drug users to establish the degree of illicit drug use in prisons, the prevalence of risk behaviours for HIV infection, and the uptake of treatment for drug dependency with drugs within the prison system. DESIGN--Anonymous, self administered, questionnaire. SETTING--Two drug agencies in central London; one operating a scheme for exchanging needles, and the other offering drug advice and information. SUBJECTS--50 (42 Men, eight women) self selected injecting drug users (mean age 31.2 (range 21-42)), all of whom had been held in custody at some time since 1982. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Details about periods served in custody since 1982; the number of respondents who took drugs (orally or by injection), either illicitly or prescribed, while in prison and the types of substances taken; the respondents' sexual activity in prison and between periods in custody. RESULTS--The average time spent in custody before the study was 20.6 months (range 1-72). Most prosecutions were directly or indirectly related to drug taking. 47 Of the 50 respondents reported taking at least one illicit drug while in custody; 33 by injection, 26 of whom had shared injecting equipment. 30 Had been treated for drug dependency by the prescribing of drugs while in prison. While in custody, one woman and four men (with a mean of seven (range 2-16) male partners) had had sex. Between periods spent in custody, men reported having a mean of eight (range 0-90) female partners and women a mean of one (range 0-3) male partner. Three men had had sex with other men, with a mean of six (range 2-11) partners. Since their last period in custody, men had had a mean of two (range 0-18) female partners and women had had a mean of two (range 1-3) male partners. Five men had also had male partners. CONCLUSIONS--A high prevalence of injecting and sexual risk behaviours among injecting drug users within and between periods in custody has been shown. Most of these offenders continued to take drugs while in custody, and just over half not only injected drugs but shared equipment. Some of the male prisoners compounded their risk of HIV infection by engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners. Prisoners who then have multiple sexual partners after release place their partners in the community at particular risk of HIV infection. Although many of the drug users were prescribed drugs for their dependency, limited access to appropriate treatment, counselling, and health education may compound the situation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To identify the types of human papillomaviruses found in anogenital warts in children and to relate these to clinical and social information. DESIGN--In situ hybridisation using biotin labelled DNA probes to 11 types of human papillomavirus was performed on biopsy specimens from 17 children with anogenital warts. SETTING--Nuffield department of pathology and the department of dermatology, Oxford. PATIENTS--Children in one group were referred by general practitioners or paediatricians to the dermatology department, where biopsies were performed. The other children were seen in four different hospitals, and biopsy specimens were submitted to the laboratory at the physician's or pathologist's request. RESULTS--Of the 17 biopsy specimens, 10 contained cells positive with a probe to a genital human papillomavirus type (types 6 or 11), while six were positive with a skin virus type (types 2 or 3). One was negative. The virus type present bore no relation to the site or appearance of the warts. The virus type did, however, appear to correlate with groups of children. Skin types were commoner in older children (over 4 years), in those with a relative who had skin warts, and in children with warts elsewhere; there was no relation with the child's sex and no suspicion of sexual abuse in these children. These circumstances suggested non-sexual transmission, such as autoinoculation. In contrast, genital types were commoner in girls, in children under 3 years, in children with relatives with genital warts, and in those with no warts elsewhere. Nevertheless, there was suspicion or evidence of sexual abuse in only half these children, suggesting that other routes of transmission--for example, perinatal--might have been implicated. CONCLUSION--Anogenital warts in children may contain either skin or genital wart virus type. Although the type of human papillomavirus present may give some indication of the likely mode of transmission, this can be interpreted only in conjunction with all available clinical and social information. The type of virus does not provide proof of the presence or absence of sexual transmission.\r"

Three months postoperatively the stimulator settings were adjusted after measurement of simultaneous anorectal and low colonic pressures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Full defecation. RESULTS--Six patients achieved complete rectal evacuation of faeces using the implant and subsequently did not require manual help for defecation. For all but one of the patients the total time taken to complete defecation was reduced, and all were free from constipation, the most prevalent gastrointestinal symptom in patients with spinal injuries. CONCLUSIONS--Sacral anterior root stimulators can be programmed to achieve complete unassisted defecation and can considerably improve the quality of life of patients with spinal injuries.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To develop and report the results of a system of audit of computer records in general practice. DESIGN--A retrospective audit of records in practices using the same computer system. Information about recorded preventive procedures was collected by sending the same audit program to each practice on floppy disk. Other characteristics of the practices were determined by postal questionnaire. SETTING--Forty five general practices, widely distributed in England and Wales. SUBJECTS--All 430,901 patients registered with the practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Within each practice the percentage of patients in specified age groups for whom certain preventive procedures were recorded as having been carried out. These measures were analysed in relation to practice characteristics. RESULTS--Practice characteristics and recording rates for preventive procedures varied over a wide range. Recording rates were higher in practices with computer terminals on every doctor's desk. Only one practice achieved the new contract target of 90% coverage for recorded primary immunisations, and fewer than two thirds recorded 80% coverage for cervical cytology in the past five years. Practices holding clinics did no better than those without. Smaller partnerships and smaller doctors' list sizes were associated with better performance. CONCLUSIONS--Centrally programmed audit of computerised records is a feasible method of providing data on a regular basis for epidemiological purposes and for performance review. The fact that practices with smaller list sizes had higher levels of recorded preventive care suggests that the trend towards larger lists promoted by the new contract might militate against the intended effect of better preventive care.\r"

  ".W": "Although Baltistan, north east Pakistan, is in a region of iodine deficiency disorders, the distribution of goitre within the district, according to age and sex, has not been clearly defined. To establish the prevalence of the condition and to measure the reported difference in prevalence in the north and south of the district thyroid size was assessed in new patients attending the Aman clinic, Khapalu, and outlying areas between April and September from 1981 to 1986. Samples of potable water collected from villages were analysed for iodine (as iodide) concentrations in Britain. Population weighted prevalences were: in the north in males 20.4%, in females 28.1% and in the south in males 13.9%, in females 21.2%. There was an overall deficiency of iodine in the water (mean iodine (as iodide) concentrations (north) 11.0 nmol/l (1.4 micrograms/l), (south) 11.8 nmol/l (1.5 micrograms/l) (95% confidence interval -0.7 to 0.9). The differences followed the Main Karakoram Thrust, suggesting a geological goitrogen in the north, which might be minerals containing ions such as BF4- and SO3F-, and molybdenite and calcium, which are present in rocks in Baltistan. A new hypothesis for the genesis of endemic goitre is proposed--that is, that continents on crustal plates drift across the earth and collide, one plate sliding under the other and melting, giving rise to characteristic mineral assemblages in the overlying rocks. As the minerals weather out they enter the diet of the local population, where in the presence of iodine deficiency they produce or enhance iodine deficiency disorders. Despite the current iodised oil campaign by the Pakistani government with Unicef a long term working iodisation programme is still urgently needed.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To see whether adults with high blood cholesterol concentrations (greater than 6.5 mmol/l) detected by case finding return to their doctor, receive appropriate advice, and report changes in their diet and whether adults found not to have high cholesterol concentrations on case finding are discouraged from changing their diet. DESIGN--Follow up study. SETTING--Seven general practices in the lower Hunter region of Australia. PARTICIPANTS--600 Men and women aged 25-65 who had their blood cholesterol concentrations measured three to four months earlier while attending their general practitioner. Analysis conducted on 552 (92%) who returned follow up postal questionnaires. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Of the 125 subjects found to have blood cholesterol concentrations greater than 6.5 mmol/l, 102 (82%) returned to their doctor and 83 of these recalled receiving dietary advice. 93 (75%) Subjects with high concentrations reported changing their diet compared with 72 (46%) subjects with concentrations of greater than 5.5-6.5 mmol/l and 44 (17%) subjects with lower concentrations. Overall 333 (61%) of all respondents who answered reported not changing their diet, the most common reason (nearly half the sample; n = 266) being that their cholesterol concentration was \"all right.\" Adults without high cholesterol concentrations who returned to their doctor were also significantly more likely to recall their doctor saying that they did not need to lower their concentrations (less than or equal to 5.5 mmol/l = 61%; greater than 5.5-6.5 mmol/l = 12%; greater than 6.5 mmol/l = 5%) and significantly less likely to recall receiving dietary advice (less than or equal to 5.5 mmol/l = 13%; greater than 5.5-6.5 mmol/l = 60%; greater than 6.5 mmol/l = 82%). CONCLUSIONS--High risk strategies which require everyone to be tested for high cholesterol concentrations may interfere with population strategies designed to reduce everyone's dietary intake of fat.\r"

SETTING--Outpatient chest clinic in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--68 Patients divided into four groups of similar age--namely, 15 receiving long term oral prednisolone, 21 receiving high dose inhaled corticosteroids, 15 receiving low dose inhaled corticosteroids, and 17 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Skin thickness at three sites measured by A scan ultrasound and clinical assessment of purpura. RESULTS--Compared with controls patients in both the oral prednisolone treated group and the high dose inhaled corticosteroid treated group had significantly thinner skin at all three sites (group median thicknesses: prednisolone treated group 28-33% less than controls; high dose inhaled corticosteroid treated group 15-19% less than controls). Differences in skin thicknesses between the low dose inhaled corticosteroid treated group and the controls were trivial. The prevalence of purpura was significantly greater in patients receiving oral prednisolone (12/15 patients) and high dose inhaled corticosteroids (10/21) than in controls (2/17). CONCLUSION--Skin thinning and purpura represent further evidence of systemic effects of high dose inhaled corticosteroids.\r"

DESIGN--Comparison of results of audit of management of all seriously injured patients before and after these measures were introduced. SETTING--Accident and emergency department in an urban hospital. PATIENTS--All seriously injured patients (injury severity score greater than 15) admitted to the department six months before and one year after introduction of the measures. RESULTS--Management errors were reduced from 58% (21/36) to 30% (16/54) (p less than 0.01). Correct treatment rather than improvement in diagnosis or investigation accounted for almost all the improvement. CONCLUSIONS--The management of seriously injured patients in the accident and emergency department can be improved by introducing two simple measures: using the revised trauma score as a triage tool to help junior doctors in the accident and emergency department rapidly identify seriously injured patients, and calling a senior accident and emergency specialist to supervise the resuscitation of all seriously injured patients. IMPLICATIONS--Care of patients in accident and emergency departments can be improved considerably at no additional expense by introducing two simple measures.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the meaningfulness of a year's worth of audit data relating to all the inpatients of one consultant general surgeon and to question the usefulness of certain outcome measures. DESIGN--Analysis of records entered on to audit computer (Dunnfile) and relating to inpatient episodes for one consultant general surgeon over one year. Data obtained were compared with ward records and the patient administration system to check their accuracy. SETTING--The three hospitals and 12 wards in Brighton health district where the surgeon admitted patients. SUBJECTS--859 Records relating to inpatient episodes from 1 January to 31 December 1988. These covered 655 main procedures and 79 secondary procedures performed at the same time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Procedures were analysed by complexity of operation (BUPA code) and grade of surgeon; complications were counted and rates constructed by surgeon and by BUPA code: returns to theatre were analysed. RESULTS--Simple counts revealed some data, such as the fact that one registrar performed more major operations (32) than the senior registrars (22 and 14), and an analysis of complications showed that he had a lower complication rate (11.4% v 20.0% and 19.4%). But the simple complication rate disclosed nothing about whether the complication was avoidable. Likewise, the number of returns to theatre needed further qualification. Analysis of data collection for February to April 1988 showed a 30% deficit of information on the audit system compared with ward records and prompted a re-examination of everyone's role in collecting data. After the year's audit there was still a 17% shortfall compared with the district's patient administration system, though some of this was accounted for by a backlog of work. CONCLUSIONS--It is difficult to ensure adequate data collection and entails everyone in an unfamiliar discipline. Connecting the audit system to the patient administration system would help. Despite the limitations of crude analyses of workload and complications rates, the audit data helped to measure activity and in the management of the firm. Nevertheless, time and care have to be taken in presenting and interpreting audit data carefully. IMPLICATIONS--Counting is not enough.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To investigate (a) which clinical variables and physiological measures of disease severity best predict death in very low birthweight infants and (b) their use in comparing mortality between two neonatal units. DESIGN--Retrospective study of two cohorts of very low birthweight infants from overlapping time periods who received mechanical ventilation. SETTING--Two neonatal intensive care units (hospitals A and B). SUBJECTS--262 Very low birthweight infants, 130 in hospital A, 132 in hospital B. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death in hospital. RESULTS--In hospital A the mean level of oxygenation in the first 12 hours of life, whether measured as inspired oxygen requirement (FIO2), arterial/alveolar oxygen (a/AO2) ratio, or alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2), was more closely associated with death than any of four \"traditional\" risk factors: low birth weight, short gestation, the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome, and male sex. Mean pH in the first 12 hours was as strongly associated with death as birth weight. Multiple logistic regression models were derived in infants from hospital A using the four traditional risk factors with measures of oxygenation and pH. The validity of each model was then tested in infants from hospital B. The model based on the four traditional risk factors alone predicted death in hospital B with only 31% sensitivity. Adding mean a/AO2 ratio and mean pH increased its sensitivity to 75%, and when mean a/AO2 ratio was replaced by mean FIO2 its sensitivity increased further to 81%. Based on crude mortality rates alone, the odds of death in hospital A versus hospital B were 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.37 to 1.23). After correcting for traditional risk factors and mean FIO2 and mean pH, however, the odds of death in hospital A increased to 3.27 (1.35 to 7.92; p less than 0.01). This increased risk persisted after adjusting for the time difference between each cohort. CONCLUSIONS--Crude comparisons of hospital mortality can be highly misleading. Reliable assessment of neonatal outcome is impossible without correcting for major risk factors, particularly initial disease severity. International agreement on a minimum core dataset of clinical and physiological information could improve neonatal audit and help to identify effective treatments and policies.\r"

DESIGN--Survey of sample of adults who had been adopted in childhood to relate their body mass index to sociodemographic variables in a series of multiple linear regression analyses. SUBJECTS--4643 Subjects traced from a register of 5455 non-familial adoptees registered in 1924-47, of whom 3651 gave details of current height, weight, and occupation. The final sample totalled 2015 adoptees for whom there was also information on their region of upbringing and on the social class of their adoptive and biological fathers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age, sex, body mass index, social class (of adoptee and adoptive and biological father), and geographical region. RESULTS--There was a significant inverse relation of adoptees' body mass index with their own social class and that of both their biological and adoptive fathers. Adoptees raised in provincial areas had a significantly greater body mass index than did those raised in Copenhagen. A multivariate regression model, including age, sex, and social class of the adoptee, confirmed the significant independent influence of the social class of both adoptive and biological fathers and of region of rearing on adoptees' body mass index. CONCLUSION--Both familial environmental and genetic factors contribute to the relation of parental social class to adult fatness, and they are partly independent of the effect of an individual's own social class. The influence of region of upbringing on adult fatness is of environmental origin and is independent of social class characteristics.\r"

  ".U": "90322079\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVES--To assess the magnitude of the problem of interval cancers of the cervix (those that are diagnosed within a short time after negative screening test results) in the 1980s, to compare the nature of interval cancers in younger women with that in older women, and, by reviewing negative cervical smears, to determine the proportion of interval cancers that might represent the development of malignancy anew compared with the proportion that might be associated with difficulties in sampling or errors in reporting. DESIGN--An audit of the interval cases of cervical cancer that had been diagnosed within 36 months of a smear having been reported as negative by the Victorian Cytology Gynaecological Service among women registered with cervical cancer during 1982-6. SETTING--The Victorian Cytology Gynaecological Service, a free public sector cytology laboratory in Victoria, Australia. SUBJECTS--138 Women, all of whom had had cervical cancer diagnosed during the 36 months after having had a negative cervical smear. Subjects were divided into two age groups: younger women, aged less than 35; older women, aged 35-69. INTERVENTIONS--Negative slides were reviewed for evidence of optimal sampling and for the presence of cellular abnormalities that had been missed at the time of the original reporting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The number of interval cases of cancer of the cervix registered during 1982-6. The proportion of interval cases occurring in younger women and the proportion occurring in older women. Division of women into three risk categories based on clinical history and screening history that broadly corresponded to the probability that a diagnosis of cervical cancer might be expected during the 36 months after the issuing of a negative smear report. RESULTS--138 Of 1044 (13.2%) women who had been registered with cervical cancer during 1982-6 had had one or more negative smears during the 36 months preceding the diagnosis of cancer. Interval cancers comprised a larger proportion of registrations of cervical cancer in women aged less than 35 years than in women aged 35-69 (21.1% v 11.0%, p less than 0.01). Women with interval cancer who had had at least three negative smears during the 10 years before the diagnosis of cancer were commoner in the younger age group than in the older age group (7.0% v 2.5%, p less than 0.01). When, however, the number of observed cases of squamous cell carcinoma was related to the number of expected cases in the absence of screening, no significant difference was found between the two age groups (6.8% v 4.8%, p greater than 0.10). The rate of diagnosis of interval cancer per 100,000 negative tests was lower among younger women than among older women (10/100,000 v 16/100,000). Review of the negative slides showed that 11.9% were again considered to be negative with an optimal sample having been obtained as evidenced by the presence of endocervical cells or metaplastic cells, or both. CONCLUSIONS--Interval cancers might comprise a larger proportion of all registered cases of cervical cancer among younger women owing to the larger proportion of such cancers being prevented in this age group. Among women with interval cancer review of the negative slides showed that most were accounted for by suboptimal sampling or by errors of reporting.\r"

DESIGN--Pragmatic study with randomised order of use of recording instruments. Phase 1 compared a peak expiratory flow type expiration recorded by the mini Wright peak flow meter with an expiration to forced vital capacity recorded by the turbine spirometer. Phase 2 compared peak expiratory flow type expirations recorded by both meters. Reproducibility was assessed separately. SETTING--Routine surgeries at Aldermoor Health Centre, Southampton. SUBJECTS--212 Patients aged 4 to 78 presenting with asthma or obstructive airways disease. Each patient contributed only once to each phase (105 in phase 1, 107 in phase 2), but some entered both phases on separate occasions. Reproducibility was tested on a further 31 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--95% Limits of agreement between measurements on the two meters. RESULTS--208 (98%) Of the readings taken by the mini Wright meter were higher than the corresponding readings taken by the turbine spirometer, but the 95% limits of agreement (mean difference (2 SD] were wide (1 to 173 l/min). Differences due to errors in reproducibility were not sufficient to predict this level of disagreement. Analysis by age, sex, order of use, and the type of expiration did not detect any significant differences. CONCLUSIONS--The two methods of measuring peak expiratory flow rate were not comparable. The mini Wright meter is likely to remain the preferred instrument in general practice.\r"

The idiopathic stone formers had been on regular treatment with a low calcium diet. The bone mineral content of the radius was reduced to a similar level in both groups of patients. The data suggest that idiopathic stone formers on a low calcium diet are at risk of osteopenia; the factors which could lead to a negative calcium balance included uncompensated renal hypercalciuria, hypophosphataemia and exaggerated serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. To treat idiopathic hypercalciuria, thiazide diuretics, which reduce the renal excretion of calcium and have been shown to be beneficial for bone, seem safer than a low calcium diet.\r"

The survival status of all patients was established as accurately as possible in the last 2 years of the study. Multivariate analysis of 462 bladder cancer patients with adequate follow-up indicated that T category was the most important discriminating variable, followed by histological grade. After replacing T category by microscopic depth of invasion and bimanual examination, the latter was found to be the most important single variable. The omission of the findings on bimanual examination from the 1987 revision of the TNM classification therefore appears to be wrong.\r"

The recurrence of bladder cancer could be predicted with the M/V index. Survival analysis with Cox's regression model pointed to primary tumour clinical stage as the most important prognostic factor of crude survival. Histologically, grade and the SD of nuclear area were the best prognostic factors. Primary tumour stage and histological grade were the best predictors of death from bladder cancer. In Cox's model, histoquantitative methods are almost as good as clinical staging in predicting prognosis. DNA flow cytometry of paraffin embedded material offered no advantage over clinical stage, histological grade or morphology in assessing prognosis.\r"
