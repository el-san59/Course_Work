  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that large genetic differences exist in the extent to which orally delivered ethanol will come to serve as a positive reinforcer under operantly defined conditions. In addition, these studies suggest that a significant correlation exists between results from two-bottle choice studies of ethanol drinking and operant self-administration studies of ethanol functioning as a reinforcer. The present paper reports further genetic influences on ethanol self-administration which were found using Long Sleep and Short Sleep mice, bred selectively for high and low duration of loss of the righting reflex in responses to ethanol, respectively. It was possible to establish ethanol as a reinforcer in Long Sleep mice but not in Short Sleep mice. These results indicate that neurosensitivity to ethanol may determine the absolute amount of ethanol consumption but is not highly related to the ability of ethanol to serve as a positive reinforcer. In addition, this paper presents genetic correlations which indicate that (a) ethanol preference and self-administration are highly correlated across genotype; (b) sensitivity to ethanol and self-administration of this drug are not highly genetically correlated; (c) ethanol is not self-administered in operant studies solely for its caloric value; and (d) there exist important genetic determinants of drug reinforced behavior.\r"

This paper reviews some of these recent findings and presents new data concerning these models of oral ethanol self-administration as measured in an operant paradigm.\r"

  ".W": "This review examines some particular approaches that have been used to investigate factors that facilitate or constrain the self-administration of ethanol by rats. A technique for increasing ethanol self-administration in rats, the prandial drinking method, was examined and the effect of body-weight reduction on drug intake was discussed. Emphasis was placed on how ethanol intake may be controlled by processes in addition to the direct pharmacological actions of the drug in the CNS. These processes may be physiological. Evidence was presented for a relationship between activity in the renin-angiotensin system and the self-administration of ethanol. These processes may also be environmental. Using the place-conditioning technique, demonstrations were presented of how the context or situation in which ethanol is experienced may determine whether preference or aversion for the drug develops. Such a diversity in the factors that can potentially control ethanol intake may complicate the identification of the causes of alcohol abuse, but this same diversity also holds out greater hope that manipulations may be found to reduce excessive drinking in humans.\r"

The most frequently observed effects of abuse substances on this phenomenon is an increase in sensitivity of the animal to the stimulation. This increased sensitivity to rewarding brain stimulation has been studied as a model of drug-induced euphoria. Although many studies have reported that ethanol does increase the sensitivity of animals to this stimulation, there is much less consistency in results between laboratories than observed with the abused opiates or psychomotor stimulants. Data is presented that suggests that associative factors, e.g., self- versus experimenter-administered ethanol, as well as route of administration and time of brain stimulation testing may all contribute to the variability in results obtained between laboratories. Further, the effects of ethanol on brain stimulation reward are more like those of other sedative-hypnotics than the opiates or psychomotor stimulants.\r"

Liver biopsies from control and treated animals were fractionated by differential centrifugation and the subcellular fractions were analyzed for ALDH activity. Significantly less activity was observed in cell homogenates from treated animals (20-50% of control activity per gram of liver). The majority of loss in activity was accounted for by a decrease in ALDH activity in the soluble fraction of the cell (12-30% of control activity) and in the mitochondrial fraction (23-30% of control activity). Activities at both high (5 mM) and low (50 microM) acetaldehyde concentrations were affected. The subcellular distribution of ALDH activity and in vivo inhibition by disulfiram in dogs is different from that reported for rats.\r"

Comparisons were made among nondrinkers, social drinkers, short-term sober (less than 30 days) alcoholics and long-term sober (greater than 30 days) alcoholics. Results of these comparisons provided little support for the notion that neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol consumption are directly related to cognitive impairment. Instead, these results suggested that performance differences among the groups were more closely related to subclinical withdrawal symptoms or native ability than to long-term alcohol consumption. Because none of the dependent measures was related to length of abstinence, and because Wechsler's Adult Intelligence Scale-R Vocabulary differences among groups paralleled neuropsychological test performance differences, it is suggested that differences among groups may reflect differences in native ability. In addition, there were no differences between social drinkers and nondrinkers, nor were there any significant correlations among drinking variables and performance of social drinkers, providing further evidence against a direct relationship between alcohol consumption and cognitive performance.\r"

Alcohol-related dementia accounts for nearly 20% of all admissions to state mental hospitals and may result from head trauma, thiamine deficiency, Alzheimer's, and other brain diseases that can be diagnosed conclusively only at autopsy. However, we postulate that after all these conditions have been excluded, an \"alcohol encephalopathy\" remains. This is characterized by impaired synaptic function, which underlies the continuum of impaired intellectual function. We found in 79 histologically normal brains of a nondemented general hospital population a 40% decrease in the density of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the frontal cortex of alcoholics when compared with matched controls of the same age. Only alcohol abuse and not aging, postmortem changes, medications, clinical (including liver) diseases, or differences in causes of death could account for this loss.\r"

Plasma carnitine concentrations are elevated in several conditions and reflect changes at the cellular level. We previously had reported elevated plasma carnitine in patients with alcoholic liver disease compared to healthy control subjects. In this study we measured plasma carnitine in a third group, alcoholic patients without overt liver disease. The alcoholic patients (n = 20) had significantly elevated plasma long-chain acylcarnitine (P less than 0.01) compared to 32 healthy men of identical age and significantly lower short-chain (P less than 0.01) and long-chain acylcarnitine (P less than 0.01) than 28 men with alcoholic liver disease. We conclude that alcoholism is another condition in which carnitine homeostasis is altered.\r"

Animals were water deprived for 24 hr and tested in one of three conditions: (a) removed from home cage, blood sample obtained immediately; (b) placed into empty novel cage, blood sample obtained 30 min later; (c) placed into novel cage with water available, blood sample obtained 30 min later. All animals showed an increase in corticoids over basal levels following 24-hr water deprivation, and placement into a novel cage produced a further significant increase in corticosterone. Opportunity to drink reduced the corticosterone response to novelty for all males. However, fetal ethanol-exposed females showed significantly less attenuation of their corticosterone response to novelty than both pair-fed and control females. In the second experiment, we examined adrenocortical habituation to a stressful stimulus. Animals were restrained in plastic tubes which restricted movement, and blood samples were obtained following 30 or 60 min of restraint. All animals showed significant corticoid elevations at 30 min. Males showed no change in corticoids from 30 to 60 min while both pair-fed and control females showed a corticoid decrease at 60 min. Fetal ethanol-exposed females, however, showed no significant corticoid decrease at 60 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Administration of ethanol induced a significant increase of both plasma ethanol and acetate, lasting 6-8 hr. The concomitant administration of carnitine resulted in a significant decrease of plasma acetate, whereas plasma ethanol levels remained unmodified. Urinary acetylcarnitine content significantly increased following administration of ethanol plus carnitine, but not when L-carnitine alone was administered. The resulting conclusion is that administered L-carnitine might trap excess acetyls derived both from free acetate, formed by ethanol oxidation, and from acetyl coenzyme A, accumulated as a result of the ethanol-induced decrease in the Krebs cycle flux.\r"

Three-point bending tests of the rat femurs showed that the maximum force or so-called \"strength\" required to break the bone was less in ethanol- than in control-fed animals. A significant inverse correlation was observed between the strength required to break the femur and the dose of ethanol calculated on a body weight basis. For the first time our study presents quantitative proof that a relationship exists between bone strength and the consumption of ethanol in rats. The study revealed that ethanol consumption resulted in a weaker femur compared to controls. We suggest that a common mechanism may be responsible for the decreased bone strength of ethanol-fed rats and the increased incidence of fractures in human alcoholics.\r"

The number of ballooned hepatocytes and necrotic hepatocytes were smaller in the alcohol-pyrazole hepatitis rats treated with malotilate for 12 weeks (Al-Py Mal group) than for those without malotilate treatment (Al-Py group). Immunohistochemically, the retention of transferrin, one of the secretory proteins from the liver, in the ballooned hepatocytes was inhibited by malotilate. Biochemically, transferrin content in the Golgi fraction of the hepatocytes was significantly lower in the Al-Py Mal group than in the Al-Py group. Hepatic acetaldehyde levels in the Al-Py Mal group were significantly lower than those in the Al-Py group, even though ethanol metabolic rates were not different between the two groups. These results indicated that malotilate prevented the development of hepatocytic injury in alcohol-pyrazole hepatitis by decreasing hepatic acetaldehyde levels and preventing the retention of transferrin in the hepatocytes.\r"

Inability to abstain from alcohol, fighting and reckless driving while intoxicated, and alcohol treatment other than Alcoholics Anonymous were more prevalent in families of male probands.

The concentrations of ethanols labeled with 1, 2, 3, and 4 deuterium atoms were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of the 3,5-dinitrobenzoates. During the first 30 min mono- and tetradeuteriated molecules appeared rapidly, which indicates that a fraction of the ethanol was formed from acetaldehyde by exchange. This fraction was calculated to be 38-58% and the hydrogen incorporated during the reduction was mainly (63-82%) derived from C-1 of ethanol, indicating slow exchange of enzyme-bound NADH. After 30 min the elimination followed first-order kinetics with t1/2 of 18-31 min and with a small primary isotope effect (1.05-1.11). This indicates almost complete removal of ethanol from blood passing through the liver when the concentration is low (below 1 mM). The results indicate that as long as hepatic blood flow is not limiting, the rate of alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed elimination of a small dose of ethanol in vivo is limited by the dissociation of NADH from the enzyme and by the rates of oxidation of acetaldehyde and reoxidation of NADH.\r"

  ".W": "Parenteral drug abusers are at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We tested stored sera for antibody to HIV (anti-HIV) using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods and Western blot. The patients were parenteral drug abusers who had undergone percutaneous liver biopsy for chronic liver disease. Current or former alcohol abuse was noted in 88 (80%) of the 110 patients. The sensitivities of the two ELISA tests in comparison with Western blot, the more specific test for HIV, were 100 and 94%, respectively; the specificities were 94 and 99%. Western blot was positive in 36 (33%) of 110 patients. False-positive ELISA reactions for anti-HIV were seen in five (7%) of 70 patients with negative Western blot analyses. Compared to true-negatives, false-positives had significantly more years of alcohol abuse, younger ages of onset of alcohol abuse, greater frequencies of jaundice and edema, higher levels of alkaline phosphatase, total billirubin, total protein, and globulins, and lower levels of serum albumin. In a stepwise logistic regression, only hyperglobulinemia was significantly associated with a false-positive anti-HIV. We conclude that: (a) ELISA tests for anti-HIV are useful for screening abusers of alcohol and parenteral drugs with chronic liver disease for HIV infection, but positive results must be confirmed with more specific tests such as Western blot; (b) false-positive ELISA reactions in this population are associated with hyperglobulinemia; and (c) studies of HIV testing are needed in other populations of patients with alcoholism or liver disease.\r"

Additional doses were given at the end of each of the next 2 hr to maintain their BAC near peak for approximately 3 hr. During both testings, subjects' self-reports of their emotional responses and perceived intoxication following alcohol dosing were only minimally correlated with their alcohol metabolism parameters and reported average level of alcohol use. Repeatabilities (test-retest correlations) for subjects' self-reports of positive affect and of intoxication following alcohol dosing were consistently high, in contrast to earlier reports of minimal repeatabilities for alcohol metabolism and responses to alcohol on physiological, motor coordination, reaction time, and perceptual speed measures. Tester ratings of the subjects' levels of intoxication were also moderately stable between the two testings.\r"

  ".W": "An investigation was carried out to test the hypothesis that the area postrema (AP) may detect ethanol as a blood-borne toxin and thereby mediate aversive postingestinal effects of the drug. These aversive effects in turn may impose an upper limit on the amount of drug that can be consumed. In Experiment 1 rats had continuous access to water and a 4% ethanol solution. Animals with AP lesions drank more ethanol than sham-operated controls. No differences in drug disposition or metabolism were found when these rats were injected with ethanol and blood ethanol levels were measured. If the AP lesions resulted in increased ethanol drinking because of a reduction in the aversive effects of the drug, then the lesions might also be expected to attenuate a conditioned taste aversion induced by ethanol. In Experiment 2, groups of lesioned and sham-operated rats drank a novel tasting fluid and then were given i.p. injections of ethanol (0.9, 1.2, or 1.6 g/kg) or vehicle. Similar degrees of aversion to the taste of the fluid developed in both the lesioned and the sham-control groups. Since the AP lesion did not result in the attenuation of the ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion, it was suggested that the AP may not mediate the aversive consequences of ethanol and that the increased ethanol self-administration observed in Experiment 1 may be due to other effects of the lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol-induced flushing (EIF) occurs in up to 80% of Asians and is characterized by facial flushing, tachycardia, and increased cardiac output. Since endogenous opiates and prostaglandins may be mediators of flushing syndromes, we attempted to block EIF in four Asian flushers with single doses of either the opiate antagonist nalmefene, or the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin. Nonflushers (2 Caucasian, 2 Asian) and four Asian flushers were given on separate days water, ethanol (0.4 g/kg p.o.), ethanol plus nalmefene (2 mg i.v.), or ethanol plus indomethacin (50 mg p.o.). Ethanol concentrations of flushers and nonflushers were similar. Mean (+/- SEM) plasma acetaldehyde concentrations of flushers (28.2 +/- 11.8 microM) were significantly greater than nonflushers (1.4 +/- 0.5 microM) following ethanol ingestion (p less than 0.001). Ethanol alone always induced a significant rise in facial skin temperature [mean area under the curve (AUC) = 5142 +/- 648 % delta T x min, p less than 0.01] and of pulse (mean AUC = 1622 +/- 120 bpm x min, p less than 0.001) in flushers compared to water ingestion. A single dose of nalmefene (2 mg i.v.) but not indomethacin (50 mg p.o.), reduced the mean (+/- SEM) ethanol-induced rise in facial skin temperature of flushers by 58 +/- 14% (p less than 0.05) without changing plasma acetaldehyde concentrations. These data are preliminary evidence that the opiate antagonist, nalmefene, blocks some of the vascular manifestations of EIF without altering the elevated plasma concentrations of acetaldehyde.\r"

The two mitochondrial enzymes as with other mammalian mitochondrial enzymes had properties very similar to that of the corresponding human enzyme. These include immunological as well as basic kinetic properties such as low Km for aldehyde, activation by Mg2+ ions, and lack of inhibition by disulfiram. A major difference between these two enzymes and the human mitochondrial enzyme was that they contained an N-terminal-blocked amino acid. Cytosolic ALDHs from human and horse liver have been shown to possess an N-acetyl serine as the N-terminal residue; beef cytosolic ALDH was also found to be blocked. Tissue preparations and subcellular fractions from beef or pig liver could be used to study acetaldehyde oxidation. This is the subject of the accompanying paper (Cao Q-N, Tu G-C, Weiner H, Alcohol Clin Exp Res 12:xxx-xxx, 1988).\r"

It has not been established where the subcellular oxidation of acetaldehyde occurs in species other than rat. Using slices isolated from beef and pig livers and selectively inhibiting the mitochondria enzyme with cyanamide or the cytosolic enzyme with disulfiram, it was possible to address this question. It was found that with both beef and pig liver slices 60% of the oxidation was catalyzed by the mitochondrial ALDH and 20% by the higher Km cytosolic enzyme. The remainder of the metabolism was the result of non-ALDH involvement. Furthermore, any decrease in the level of the low Km mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase activity resulted in a decreased rate of acetaldehyde oxidation showing that its activity governed the rate of acetaldehyde oxidation. These were the same conclusions previously reached using rat liver tissue slices. Thus, it appears that for all mammalian tissue, mitochondria is the primary location of acetaldehyde oxidation.\r"

We used light and electron microscopic as well as quantitative immunochemical techniques to compare distribution, characteristics, and amount of Alz 50 antigen in the tegmental nuclei of the pons of subjects with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and subjects with AD. In both conditions Alz 50 antigen was found in neurons with and without neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). In NFT-bearing neurons the antigen was located in the filamentous components of NFT in both diseases, i.e., in straight filaments forming the NFT in PSP and in paired helical filaments components of the NFT in AD. In neurons lacking NFT the antigen was associated with straight filaments of various sizes, but the straight filaments were generally thinner than those of PSP. On immunoblots of both PSP and AD tissues, Alz 50 recognized a set of bands between 68 and 35 kDa which were not present in control tissue. The amount of Alz 50 antigen in AD tissue was estimated to be 10 times higher than that present in PSP tissue. The higher amount of Alz 50 antigen in AD tissue correlates with the more severe fibrillary pathology in this disease than in PSP. We propose that the Alz 50 antigen, although possibly related to tau proteins, distinguishes neurons that are forming abnormal filaments.\r"

On bromocriptine, the patients showed polysomnographically a mean decrease of 43% from control and a mean decrease of 57% from placebo in the number of periodic movements of sleep per hour of sleep (p less than 0.025). Two of 3 patients with abnormally decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency showed an improvement in these measures on therapy. The dopamine agonist bromocriptine may be a useful therapy in some patients with restless legs syndrome.\r"

Previously undiagnosed cases were selected with intraocular pressure of 26 mmHg or more on two occasions together with field loss characteristic of glaucoma. Analysis was performed on one eye selected at random from each of 99 patients. Conventional medical treatment followed in unsuccessful cases by trabeculectomy (group A) was compared with trabeculectomy at diagnosis followed when necessary by supplementary medical therapy (group B). The life expectancy of these glaucoma patients was found to be similar to that for the local population matched for age and sex. In group A after four years trabeculectomy had been performed in 53% of eyes because medical management had failed to control the disease. The rate of operation was lower in those patients with intraocular pressure less than 31 mmHg and mild relative field loss (17% at three years) than in those with intraocular pressure greater than 30 mmHg and dense scotomas (75% at three years). Early surgery provided much more stable control with fewer changes in treatment than in group A. The group mean intraocular pressure after trabeculectomy was 15.0 mmHg irrespective of the time of operation, and this was significantly lower than the intraocular pressure in those cases thought to be controlled on medical therapy alone at the end of the first year (20.8 mmHg). Early operation provided significantly better protection of visual field, and the extra loss of visual field with delayed operation occurred in the preoperative period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The inhalation of smoke results in a series of pathophysiological events involving the respiratory and circulatory systems. Upper airway injury is mainly the result of heat damage. The lesions of the tracheobronchial and parenchymal areas are more related to the chemicals present in the smoke. The initial damage of the tracheobronchial mucosa results in chemotaxis of leucocytes into the airway tissues, with release of inflammatory mediators and formation of exudative materials. Bronchial oedema, bronchoconstriction, and bronchial obstruction by cast materials develop. The pulmonary microvasculature shows a permeability type of lesion, which is the result of mediator release from entrapped polymorphonuclear cells. This parenchymal lesion may relate to the tracheobronchial damage and be the result of a reperfusion injury. The systemic changes which have been identified relate to an increase in microvascular permeability and a reduction of myocardial contractility secondary to the inhalation of the toxic products of smoke. These latter findings may help to explain the difficulty encountered in resuscitating some of the burn victims who have concomitant inhalation injury.\r"

  ".W": "Digital subtraction coronary angiograms (DSA) of 27 patients who had undergone coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to a total of 32 lesions were analyzed using an automated border-detecting computer program and hand-held caliper measurement of diameter percent stenosis. The results were compared with visual interpretation of the 35-mm cineangiograms. Visual reports significantly overestimated the pre-PTCA diameter percent stenosis (P less than .001) and underestimated the residual post-PTCA narrowing compared with the automatic computer program (P less than .001). Caliper measurements overestimated significantly the pre-PTCA stenosis in comparison with the computer (P less than .01), but post-PTCA the two methods did not differ significantly (P = .105). There was a positive but poor correlation between caliper and computer measurements (r = .43, P less than .05) performed on the pre-PTCA digital angiograms. Post-PTCA the two methods correlated better (r = 0.78, P less than .001), but further statistical analysis showed important discrepancies between them. The correlation of visual reports and computer measurements was poor pre-PTCA (Kendall's tau = 0.32, P less than .05) and not statistically significant post-PTCA (tau = 0.64, P = .5). We conclude that there is observer bias in the visual reporting of angioplasty results, so that pre-PTCA lesions are overestimated, whereas post-PTCA are underestimated. Hand-held caliper measurement improves the assessment of coronary stenoses in comparison with the visual report but still may not altogether eliminate observer bias; it may overestimate the pre-PTCA stenoses compared with automated border detection.\r"

The lesions are characterized by gross and microscopic evidence of endometrium, past and present hemorrhage, inflammatory response, scarring, and dense adhesions. Electron microscopic evaluation suggests that early lesions are more common than appreciated, often retroperitoneal, and not clinically recognized. The diagnosis is established by the identification of microscopic foci of endometrium, although often the end stage reveals only hemosiderin-laden macrophages, foreign body giant cells, and proliferation of fibrous connective tissue. The presence of endometriosis alters the biology of the pelvic peritoneum in ways not universally agreed upon, but which undoubtedly influence the clinical manifestation of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The risk for developing endometriosis begins at puberty and extends to menopause in women of all races. The major pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease is the transplantation of endometrial cells to the pelvis and other abdominal organs via retrograde menstruation. Although retrograde menstruation appears to be a near universal occurrence, those women who are at particular risk for developing the disease have menstrual characteristics that increase the amount and duration of menstrual contamination of the pelvis. The ability of the body's immune system to remove this debris may play a significant independent role. In spite of the apparent association of infertility and endometriosis, there is a paucity of evidence to identify a clear cause-and-effect relationship or to clarify the specific mechanism(s) of infertility due to this enigmatic disease. Areas that warrant additional attention include the effect of endometriosis on ovulation, the impact of the immune system on the development of endometriosis, and the effect of peritoneal inflammation on reproduction. A better understanding of these areas will lead to more efficacious and specific therapies for endometriosis-associated infertility.\r"

Some authors suggest that monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) are less likely to produce weight gain than tricyclic antidepressants. This paper addresses the relative potential for weight gain with the MAOI. Assessing the potential for antidepressant-induced weight gain necessitates separating the weight changes associated with alterations in mood disorders from those due to drug-induced alterations in appetite control. The mechanisms of appetite control are reviewed briefly followed by proposed mechanisms by which the MAOI may alter this control. A literature review suggests that phenelzine is the MAOI most likely to induce weight gain; reports of isocarboxazid-induced weight gain are less common. There are no cases of tranylcypromine-induced weight gain in the literature that are clearly associated with the drug. The MAOI probably have different effects on the mechanisms of appetite control.\r"

  ".W": "Our objective was to prospectively study febrile and chill reactions associated with two amphotericin B (AB) infusion rates, slow (2-hour) versus rapid (45 minute). Seventeen consenting bone marrow transplant recipients in whom AB was to be initiated for documented or suspected fungal infections were recruited. After standardized premedication, patients received eight daily AB infusions (0.5 mg/kg/d, concentration 0.25 mg/ml). Rate was assigned using a randomized, crossover pair design. Axillary temperature, chills, and meperidine dose required to resolve chills were monitored for each infusion. For the first pair of infusions, fever (defined as a rise of 1 degree C) occurred frequently, in 12 of 17 (70.5 percent) and 13 of 17 patients (76.4 percent), with a mean rise of 1.7 degrees C (range 1.1-3.7) and 1.7 degrees C (1.1-3.5) degrees for the 45-minute and 2-hour infusions, respectively (p greater than 0.10). Chills were observed in 15 of 17 (88.2 percent) and 14 of 17 (82.3 percent) recipients of the 45-minute and 2-hour infusions, respectively. The time of onset (p greater than 0.10) and the duration of chills (p = 0.08) were similar for both infusion rates. Meperidine requirements for rapid and slow infusions were similar as well (p = 0.12). These data suggest that for patients free of preexisting renal and cardiac disease, rapid AB infusions are well tolerated and produce adverse reactions (fever and chills) similar in nature and severity to slower infusions.\r"

Numerous studies have provided data that question use of a digitalis glycoside as the agent of choice in treatment of chronic CHF. Several clinicians have suggested that diuretics, particularly thiazide diuretics, be used as initial agents in the treatment of this condition. Evidence now demonstrates that drug therapy with enalapril or the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate reduces the mortality related to chronic CHF. Additional studies are required to clarify respective roles of diuretics, digitalis glycosides, and vasodilators in the management of chronic CHF.\r"

There were no significant differences between the adherers and the non-adherers in sex, severity of hypertension, type or complexity of medication. The patient's age was the only factor which was associated with adherence. Patients under the age of 55 years or over 65 years had significantly lower adherence than those aged 55-64 years. Most previous studies coming from hospital-based or clinical trial populations have failed to demonstrate this association with age which may be characteristic of an unselected general practice population. The results may not be applicable to populations of different social or cultural background but they suggest appropriate directions for health promotion efforts in our community.\r"

In order to assess the effectiveness of medical interventions it is important to know the epidemiology of the condition. This paper reviews the incidence, natural history and risk factors for otitis media. In most cases acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion are self-limiting disorders. Complications and an abnormal course are rare. There are, however, subgroups of otitis-prone children, identifiable on the basis of risk factors. These children need special attention from the general practitioner, for example a more frequent use of medical interventions and surveillance. It is important to realize that individual and family factors have more influence on the outcome of otitis media than do the various available medical interventions.\r"

In only one patient (3%) in the cisapride group but in 43% of the placebo patients (p = 0.001), symptoms had not improved after 6 weeks. Forty patients continued treatment until week 12. At that time, control endoscopy showed a significantly (p = 0.005) higher rate of healing (no erosions, ulcers, or bleeding mucosa) in the cisapride patients (63%) than in the placebo patients (12%). At week 12, only three of the 21 cisapride patients still had moderate reflux symptoms, whereas eight of the 19 placebo patients had moderate or severe symptoms (p less than 0.05). Cisapride patients also took significantly (p less than 0.001) less antacids during the trial. These results show that cisapride, 10 mg q.i.d., heals esophagitis lesions and greatly reduces associated symptoms. The treatment was well tolerated.\r"

We used the Olympus GIF-1T10 and the HP unit, applying an average of 899 J to each bleeder. In 34 patients (97.1%) hemostasis was achieved after initial treatment. Six patients (17.6%) rebled within 1 week. With HP therapy in those six we achieved hemostasis in five (83.3%). Ultimately, only two cases failed in this study, to give a success rate of 94.3% (33/35). We conclude that HP thermocoagulation may, in the near future, replace operations in many patients with massive peptic ulcer hemorrhage.\r"

Gallbladder motor function was evaluated by real-time ultrasonography and intestinal transit time was measured by the lactulose hydrogen breath test. Postpartum correction of gallbladder and intestinal motor function is early and is initially related to the fall of serum progesterone. Other as yet unknown mechanisms operate later to achieve normalization of gallbladder motor function.\r"

Studied were 108 consecutive patients who had a percutaneous liver biopsy for the first time. In all cases the patient's clinical diagnosis recorded before biopsy was compared with the histological diagnosis of an experienced histopathologist. Prebiopsy clinical data (reported alcohol intake, signs of chronic liver disease) and laboratory data (liver function tests, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, hepatitis B serology) were reviewed. We found that a prebiopsy clinical diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease (n = 35) was confirmed by biopsy in all but one case. The prebiopsy diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease was significantly associated with a histological diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease (specificity 98%, sensitivity 79%). Individually, alcohol intake, signs of chronic liver disease, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the aspartate aminotransferase to ALT ratio, and the mean corpuscular volume were significantly associated with a histological diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease. When clinical and laboratory parameters were considered jointly using stepwise logistic regression, only reported alcohol intake and mean corpuscular volume were significant. Liver biopsy may not always be necessary for the identification of that broad group of patients with alcoholic liver disease.\r"

Patients with complaints of dry eyes and dry mouth but with no objective abnormalities served as controls. CT was not discriminative between the 2 groups. In contrast, US revealed decreased parotid gland echogenicity in most of the patients with SS, compared with only 1 patient in the group with sicca complaints only (p = 0.005). Our study suggests that US can be a useful, noninvasive method in the diagnostic investigation of patients with sicca complaints.\r"

With both the neurofilament and neuropeptide antisera, nerves were seen predominantly in a perivascular location, there being fewer nerves freely in the stromal tissue. In the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), free stromal nerves stained with neurofilament antiserum often lacked neuropeptide immunoreactivity, while this was not the case in normal synovium or synovial samples from patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Furthermore, the intensity of staining of neurotransmitter peptides was weaker in RA than in OA or normal synovial tissue. It is suggested that neurogenic inflammation may play a role in RA and that neuropeptide nerves possibly release their mediators in RA.\r"

Manifestations of this and other major carbamazepine overdoses reviewed from the literature were similar to those of tricyclic - anticholinergic overdose, with coma, hypotension, respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, abnormal movements and seizures. Fatality from cardiovascular causes occurred despite decline of serum carbamazepine levels to the putatively non-toxic range, emphasizing the potential for delayed consequences of carbamazepine overdosage. Management should consist of vigorous gastric lavage and installation of activated charcoal, full supportive care in a monitored setting and consideration of early charcoal hemoperfusion, before the patient becomes hypotensive.\r"

  ".W": "Wasting of muscle and a negative nitrogen balance are obvious effects of malnutrition, and have led to the use of anthropometric measurements and nitrogen balance for its assessment. A positive nitrogen balance and an increase in limb muscle circumference are believed to be solid indices of the beneficial effects of nutritional support. In experiments with growing rats and in young children, nitrogen retention and growth are recognized to be the desirable effects of optimal nutritional intake. This concept has been applied to malnourished adult humans (nongrowing) who have been considered potentially able to \"regrow\" the lost tissue. Although it is true that patients receiving long-term (greater than 6 months) home total parenteral nutrition (TPN), gain body weight and nitrogen over many months and years of observation, these processes are not seen during shorter (less than 40 days) periods of nutritional intervention given in hospital. Despite adequate intakes of nitrogen and calories, little or no significant increase in total body nitrogen is seen in a variety of patients receiving TPN in hospital over several weeks, but nutritional support does appear to improve outcome in the form of reduced complications after a period of support so short that body composition is barely altered. For example, Young and Hill showed that although amino acids and amino acids plus calories both resulted in equivalent sparing of body nitrogen, the latter was associated with quicker wound healing and fewer complications. Thus, the outcome and body composition data suggest that reversal of the adverse effects of malnutrition is not based on improvement of the traditional parameters of nutrition, such as gain in body nitrogen, or a demonstrable increase in muscle mass, or in plasma proteins. On the basis of the foregoing evidence, there are grounds for suspecting that functional abnormalities in adult humans may not be the result of simple loss of lean tissue and therefore may recover before such lean tissue is regained. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of Klidjian et al who showed that muscle force is a good measure of outcome. One of the major organ systems of the human body is the musculoskeletal system, and therefore it would seem important to determine the effect of malnutrition on that system. Previous studies of muscle function have been largely related to the examination of fatigue, myopathy, and endocrine-metabolic abnormalities. Subsequently we undertook initial studies of muscle function in very malnourished patients as outlined below.\r"

When this porphyrin mixture is administered systemically, it is retained preferentially in tumor tissue as compared to surrounding normal tissue. Localized tumor destruction induced by PDT results from the photochemical generation of cytotoxic oxygen species within the tumor. This review will provide a summary of historical and current research pertaining to molecular, cellular, and tissue responses induced by PDT. Emphasis is placed on information related to the chemistry of current photosensitizers, subcellular targets, preclinical treatment parameters, and clinical responses following PDT.\r"

During irradiation, temperature was sufficient for vaporization up to 5 mm from the laser source and high enough for tumor cell kill at a 10-mm distance (54 degrees C/60 sec). Intraoperative ultrasound visualized increasing photocoagulation (12-18 mm), and further controls demonstrated an echo-free core of vaporization progressively covered by increasing fibrosis, well demarcated from normal parenchyma. Microscopy revealed central coagulative necrosis marginated from the third day by a growing fibrosis. By day 20 immunoblasts and mast cells were in profusion in the lesion border, and by day 120 a fibrotic network had invaded the scar and confirmed healing free of complication. This technique is proposed for deep vaporization of disseminated hepatic metastases.\r"

When a total of five or six sutures were removed during the 5 months following surgery, less than 3 D of residual astigmatism was present in 50 eyes (74%). The axis of astigmatism changed less than or equal to 40 degrees in 74% (n = 65). In a second group of 20 eyes with double running sutures, removal of the 10-0 running suture in all 20 eyes produced an average change of 1.8 D (range = 0 to 3.75 D), with an equal number of increases and decreases. Vector analysis showed the total induced change in astigmatism was approximately twice the absolute keratometric change.\r"

Effective chemotherapy exists for retinitis caused by herpes simplex and herpes zoster, along with acute retinal necrosis. Conventional antiviral therapy and immunomodulators are ineffective in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with acquired immune deficiency disorder. Ganciclovir, a new antiviral agent, has significantly reduced visual morbidity in these patients. Recurrence of the infection is not uncommon while patients are on the drug or when the agent is discontinued, because ganciclovir is virostatic and does not stop viral replication in the retina. The inability to control this viral retinitis using presently available chemotherapy indicates a need to examine other therapeutic modalities.\r"

The technique of laser suture lysis afforded serial release of resistance to aqueous outflow through the newly performed trabeculectomy, allowing initial tight closure of the trabeculectomy to avoid the dangers of hypotony. Serial gradual loosening of the trabeculectomy closure decreased resistance to outflow through the trabeculectomy and thereby lowered the IOP to desired levels in a controlled, titrated manner. Complications decreased with experience. For 25 eyes with at least 6 months follow-up (average, 54 weeks), the average IOP decreased from 25.0 mmHg preoperatively to 12.2 mmHg postoperatively.\r"

In the absence of ptosis or ocular media opacification, a VFD greater than 8.7 that is not associated with an APD is suggestive of functional visual loss.

Surprisingly, this spatial enhancement strategy did not improve sensitivity or specificity rates of the screening beyond that achieved by considering the initial stimulus locations alone. Points missed during screening often showed a depressed sensitivity rate (measured threshold greater than 6 dB below the age-corrected normal reference value) in the same area of the threshold field. This was true in fields from abnormal and normal subjects.

Slowly progressive unilateral exophthalmos, with or without pain, was the most frequent clinical manifestation. Computed tomography (CT) of the orbit demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass. Ultrasonography showed an anechoic cystic mass. The parasitic membrane and contents were surgically removed through an orbital approach. Hydatid cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis of unilateral exophthalmos in patients from countries where echinococcosis is endemic. Preoperative recognition is important for planning an appropriate surgical treatment in avoiding complications.\r"

  ".U": "89159960\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of the inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) on the production of retinal phototoxicity by the operating microscope was studied in phakic rhesus monkeys. One eye of each monkey was exposed to light under conditions of 99% FIO2, and the other eye was exposed under 21% oxygen (O2). Three of four locations on each retina were exposed to light for durations varying from 1 1/2 to 20 minutes per exposure. Fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms were obtained 24 to 72 hours after exposure. Animals were euthanatized for analysis of retinal histopathology at intervals from 2 weeks to 8 months after light exposure. Retinal phototoxic lesions were produced after an average of 5 minutes of light exposure under both 21 and 99% O2. O2 potentiated the light damage both clinically and histologically. Under both conditions, lesion size was directly related to the duration of light exposure (P less than 0.005). Lesions near threshold produced with 99% FIO2 were 1.6 to 6.9 (mean, 2.9) times larger than the corresponding lesions formed with 21% FIO2. Histologic damage was likewise more severe in lesions produced under high O2 conditions. Retinal repair occurred in lesions produced under high and low O2 conditions. Photoreceptor regeneration was nearly complete by 18 weeks, whereas retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) recovery lagged up to 1 1/2 months. The results of this study have important implications for clinical practice: the operating microscope can produce retinal phototoxicity rapidly, and O2 administered during ophthalmic procedures may potentiate the damage if appropriate precautions are not taken.\r"

  ".W": "The most widely used poliovaccine in the United States contains the three live attenuated strains originally produced by Sabin. An inactivated (\"killed\") formulation of this trivalent polio vaccine has now been prepared. Before testing this new vaccine, we assessed the poliovirus immune status of 39 healthy adult males between the ages of 20 and 44 years and found that 69% had detectable (titer greater than or equal to 1:4) neutralizing antibody to all three types of poliovirus, whereas 31% lacked antibody to 1 or more types even though they had a history of childhood polio immunization. Of interest, the lowest levels of neutralizing antibody were found among young adults in their late 20s, 2 of whom lacked antibody to all 3 polio types. When the Sabin inactivated trivalent poliovirus vaccine was initially administered to 12 seropositive volunteers, all responded with rising titers of neutralizing antibody that persisted for at least 18 months (range, 1:249 to 1:4948). The new vaccine was also given to a second group of 9 individuals with little or no detectable neutralizing antibody to at least one poliovirus type and again all vaccinees manifested a humoral immune response to poliovirus. Except for transient local tenderness at the injection site, no untoward reactions to immunization were observed. Thus, this Phase I study (1) confirmed earlier reports that titers of poliovirus antibody may decline to undetectable levels by early adulthood and (2) demonstrated that adults previously immunized with poliovirus vaccine responded rapidly to all 3 poliovirus types (within 7 days) upon reimmunization with Sabin inactivated trivalent vaccine whether or not there was preexisting detectable antibody.\r"

Laboratory analysis of fluid aspirated from a swollen olecranon bursa is necessary to differentiate infection or gout. X-rays are useful in avulsion fracture, osteochondritis dissecans, and epiphyseal separation. Electromyography with nerve conduction velocities can localize the site of nerve entrapment. Treatment, in general, consists of prevention from further overuse, protection by rest and splinting to allow healing, pharmacologic intervention to reduce inflammation, relieve pain and combat infection, and physical therapy to restore motion and function. Surgery may be necessary to repair torn muscle, to release the wrist extensors in refractory lateral epicondylitis, and to decompress an entrapped nerve.\r"

Most minor traumatic causes of finger pain require only conservative management, including immobilization followed by exercise. Infectious causes of finger pain include cellulitis, tendinitis, paronychia, felon, and infectious emboli, which generally require antibiotics with or without drainage. Certain patients with finger pain resulting from infection should be referred to a hand surgeon. Vascular and ischemic causes of finger pain represent true emergencies, because tissue viability is dependent on prompt intervention. Whereas any sensory neuropathy may present with finger pain, carpal tunnel syndrome is among the most common. Systemic rheumatic disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or vasculitis, may begin with finger pain. In addition, such pain may be the first manifestation of a serious systemic illness, as in hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is an example of referred pain, presumably by way of neural mechanisms. Certain infectious, traumatic, and ischemic causes of finger pain must be diagnosed promptly to avoid significant morbidity; depending upon the cause of the symptoms, referral to a hand surgeon, rheumatologist, or neurologist may be appropriate. Symptomatic and functional improvement may also be hastened by the input of an occupational therapist.\r"

The maxim about foot and ankle pain is that \"the good exam begins at the back and ends at the toe.\" During this exam, the cutaneous, vascular, and neural systems need careful evaluation. The exam is directed to the region of maximal discomfort where careful palpation should pinpoint the spot of greatest tenderness. Once this region has been localized and signs and symptoms collected, consider the differential diagnosis specific for that area. This will narrow the focus, make the number of potential pain sources manageable, and often provide the answer. When the diagnosis is still unclear, obtain standard x-rays of the area. A directed evaluation to probe the region is appropriate. This can mean a bone scan to detect early avascular necrosis, stress fractures or osteomyelitis; an EMG-NCS to assess the neural circuitry; and special x-ray views, CAT scan, NMR, or arthrogram to uncover the difficult fracture. At this point, fortunately, the primary physician is not alone. The diagnostic dilemma or the difficult management case can be referred for a second opinion or therapeutic assistance to a podiatrist, rheumatologist, or the orthopedist with a special interest in feet.\r"

  ".W": "Microwaves most commonly cause anterior and/or posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities in experimental animals and, as shown in epidemiologic studies and case reports, in human subjects. The formation of cataracts seems to be related directly to the power of the microwave and the duration of exposure. The mechanism of cataractogenesis includes deformation of heat-labile enzymes, such as glutathione peroxide, that ordinarily protect lens cell proteins and membrane lipids from oxidative damage. Oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups and the formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates cause local variations in the orderly structure of the lens cells. An alternative mechanism is thermoelastic expansion through which pressure waves in the aqueous humor cause direct physical damage to the lens cells. Cataracts induced by ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays and gamma rays) usually are observed in the posterior region of the lens, often in the form of a posterior subcapsular cataract. Increasing the dose of ionizing radiation causes increasing opacification of the lens, which appears after a decreasing latency period. Like cataract formation by microwaves, cataractogenesis induced by ionizing radiation is associated with damage to the lens cell membrane. Another possible mechanism is damage to lens cell DNA, with decreases in the production of protective enzymes and in sulfur-sulfur bond formation, and with altered protein concentrations. Until further definitive conclusions about the mechanisms of microwaves and ionizing radiation induced cataracts are reached, and alternative protective measures are found, one can only recommend mechanical shielding from these radiations to minimize the possibility of development of radiation-induced cataracts.\r"

Children allocated to receive fruit flavouring were significantly quieter than the placebo group, but their degree of movement during induction was unchanged. The incidence of respiratory complications including breath-holding, laryngospasm and coughing was similar in both groups. Overall impression of the quality of induction as assessed by the anaesthetist showed no difference between the groups. This simple, cheap modification of inhalational induction warrants further appraisal while the case for disguising the odour of isoflurane remains unproven.\r"

In 1982, the Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) established that argon laser photocoagulation reduces the risk of severe visual loss in eyes with extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with macular degeneration. Subsequently, similar results were found for histoplasmic and idiopathic choroidal neovascularization. There are also encouraging data on photocoagulation of CNV in other diseases and with different wavelengths. The MPS Group has found the krypton laser to be effective for juxtafoveal CNV secondary to histoplasmosis and is evaluating argon green and krypton red lasers for subfoveal CNV. Other investigators are evaluating laser treatment of CNV associated with myopic degeneration, pigment epithelial detachment, and angioid streaks. The new tunable dye laser may further expand our ability to treat this disorder. Until CNV can be prevented, laser photocoagulation remains the treatment of choice, and clinical trials should identify appropriate cases.\r"

  ".W": "The blood flow velocities in the basal cerebral arteries can be recorded at any age by transcranial Doppler sonography. We examined nine children with either initial or developing clinical signs of brain death. Soon after successful resuscitation increased diastolic flow velocities indicated a probable decrease in cerebrovascular resistance; this was of no particular prognostic importance. As soon as there was a clinical deterioration, there was a reduction in flow velocities with retrograde flow during early diastole, probably due to an increase in cerebrovascular resistance; this indicated a doubtful prognosis. In eight of the nine children with clinical signs of brain death a typical reverberating flow pattern was found, which was characterised by a counterbalancing short forward flow in systole and a short retrograde flow in early diastole. This indicated arrest of cerebral blood flow. One newborn showed normal systolic and end diastolic flow velocities in the basal cerebral arteries for two days despite clinical and electroencephalographic signs of brain death. Shunting of blood through the circle of Willis without effective cerebral perfusion may explain this phenomenon. No patient had the typical reverberating flow pattern without being clinically brain dead. Transcranial Doppler sonography is a reliable technique, which can be used at the bedside for the confirmation or the exclusion of brain death in children in addition to the clinical examination.\r"

Patients treated with endoprosthesis had a significantly shorter initial hospital stay than those treated surgically. In the long term, overall survival in the two groups was similar and jaundice was relieved in over 90 per cent of patients. Despite more re-admissions to hospital for those patients treated endoscopically, the total time spent in hospital still remained significantly shorter in this treatment group compared with those subjected to surgery.

The accuracy was assessed by the distance between the actual and designated needle exit sites. Force was expressed in terms of the torque on the needle holder using a maximum of the torques (max. F), maximum derivative (dF/dt) and integral (IF). The effects of four factors (suturing techniques) on suturing were evaluated: (1) placement of the needle holder on the needle; (2) inclining the tissue at needle entrance, as is commonly done by elevating with forceps (unnoted role of the forceps); (3) adjustment of the needle's exit during suture placement, as is unknowingly employed in practice, and (4) variation between individual surgeons. All these factors affected the accuracy and force of suturing. Gripping the needle closer to the tip strongly reduced the max. F, dF/dt, and IF per time, as did inclining the tissue. Adjustment of exit improved accuracy, but has the potential for causing avoidable tissue injuries. Differences between surgeons suggest the necessity of addressing fundamental surgical techniques and formally incorporating them into the training programme.\r"

Of the 13 patients, 6 showed a response to therapy; the remainder showed no response or deteriorated. The commonest side-effect was hyperaesthesia, but one patient developed nephrotoxicity and one developed hepatotoxicity. Significant drug malabsorption occurred in one case. The side-effects were dose dependent and reversible.

No maneuver is 100% accurate in elucidation of cardiac abnormalities, and a given maneuver's effectiveness varies in its application. The systematic application of a combination of maneuvers improves the accuracy of diagnosis. Auscultatory findings must be interpreted with consideration of the total clinical examination including history, other physical findings, ECG, chest x-ray, and possibly an echocardiogram. Thus, the careful physiological approach to the physical examination represents a powerful noninvasive tool that can be used in combination with other information to accurately diagnose cardiac disease in many patients and efficiently direct further evaluation when necessary.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenetic mechanisms leading to beta-cell destruction and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are major histocompatibility complex (MHC) nonrestricted and are MHC associated and beta-cell specific. The macrophage peptide hormone interleukin 1 (IL-1) may be the primary MHC-nonrestricted beta-cell-destructive molecule. Beta-Cell death most likely results from free radical induction by IL-1. Thus, islet cell-specific antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are secondary in importance and time. The potentiation of IL-1 effects on beta-cells by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), another macrophage hormone controlled by a gene in the HLA region on chromosome 6, may account for the MHC association of IDDM. In the experimental model of IDDM etiopathogenesis described, release of beta-cell antigen, processed and presented by macrophages to helper T-lymphocytes, initiates a self-perpetuating and self-limiting circuit of cytokine production of which IL-1 is beta-cell cytotoxic. As postulated, the IL-1 effect is potentiated by TNF, whereas IL-1 and/or TNF production is controlled in a quantitative way by HLA-D genes.\r"

  ".W": "A large subset of individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) develops clinical nephropathy that progresses to end-stage renal failure. Identification of clinically proteinuric patients has limited impact on management of the condition. No treatment strategy has succeeded in permanently arresting the evolution of clinical nephropathy. However, important advances have been made in slowing its progress, and these are reviewed in this study. Treatment of raised blood pressure early in the course of diabetic renal disease has emerged as the most effective therapeutic measure. Susceptible individuals can be detected before persistent proteinuria becomes manifest by screening IDDM patients for microalbuminuria, which has proved predictive of persistent proteinuria in approximately 80% of cases. Microalbuminuria can be associated with a raised glomerular filtration rate and is often accompanied by subclinical increases in arterial blood pressure. The independent predictive significance of the two latter variables remains to be established in humans. Unfortunately, microalbuminuria is not apparent until 5 yr after stabilization of newly diagnosed diabetes, suggesting that it is a marker of early disease rather than an indicator of susceptibility. However, many therapeutic interventions, ranging from blood glucose control to low-protein diet and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, are effective in reducing or even normalizing microalbuminuria. If current controlled trials show that treatment of microalbuminuric patients prevents progression to clinical nephropathy, the diagnostic criteria for diabetic renal disease will require radical revision.\r"

In the Canadian open study, the rate of clinical remissions (target control of glycemia maintained with less than or equal to 0.15 U.kg-1.day-1 insulin) was unexpectedly high among 81 subjects who had been treated with cyclosporin for at least 3 mo (mean serum trough levels approximately 125 ng/ml by radioimmunoassay). Subjects entered the study within 14 wk of onset of symptoms and received 6 wk of insulin therapy. The clinical remission rate at 1 yr was 46%; of these patients, 84% were not receiving insulin. An effect on beta-cell function was suggested by recovery of plasma glucagon-stimulated C-peptide levels into the normal range in many patients, with maintenance of levels through 1 yr in patients in remission. On the basis of these findings, the French and Canadian-European study groups conducted randomized double-blind controlled trials of cyclosporin, which confirmed the results of the open studies in terms of clinical remission. The Canadian-European study also demonstrated enhancement of beta-cell function by cyclosporin by 3 mo, which was maintained for 1 yr. In the Canadian open study, most patients relapsed within a few weeks after discontinuation of cyclosporin, indicating the need for longer-term immunomodulatory therapy for maintenance of remission. The nature and degree of structural change in kidney biopsies from patients in these studies are under assessment. The results strongly support the hypothesis that autoimmune mechanisms mediate beta-cell damage in many patients with IDDM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Computers are likely to play an increasingly important role in the clinical investigation and management of patients with diabetes. The applications fall primarily into four areas: 1) data-base systems in clinics, hospitals, and research centers to facilitate surveillance of patients and analysis of data; 2) personal microcomputers for use by physicians and patients in storing, analyzing, and transmitting data; 3) portable devices to provide recommendations regarding insulin dose for patient use; and 4) memory-equipped glucose meters that provide verified data and have associated software with the capacity for sophisticated graphic and statistical analysis and detection of trends. An important outgrowth of the memory-based meter and the personal microcomputer is the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP). This is a display of the average pattern of glucose throughout the day, usually based on data from a 2-wk period. The AGP shows the median blood glucose, range, and 25th and 75th percentiles for each hour or in relationship to meals. By virtue of signal averaging in the presence of large random variability, this display may reveal patterns that are not evident on individual days.\r"

During the studies, which were designed to gain a better understanding of the etiology of perinatal morbidity, a novel means of collecting ambulatory blood glucose values was employed. Subjects used specially modified reflectance meters with onboard memories to record each value with corresponding time and date. The data were transmitted to a microcomputer and rapidly analyzed to permit effective follow-up in the study population. The system enabled the investigators to characterize metabolic control, evaluate different treatment modalities, and measure the association between glycemic control and fetal outcome. These studies indicate that patients with one elevated blood glucose value during formal glucose tolerance testings have higher blood glucose values under ambulatory conditions. Furthermore, these elevated ambulatory glucose values were significantly correlated with fetal macrosomia. Treatment regimens designed to lower verified ambulatory blood glucose measurements may help reduce fetal macrosomia in women with milder forms of gestational diabetes or in women with relative glucose intolerance without a substantial increase in severe hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose and other reducing sugars can react with proteins and nucleic acids, without the aid of enzymes, to form stable covalent adduct. These reactions, although studied by food chemists, have recently been found to occur in vivo. This has led to studies on the accumulation of these advanced glycosylation end products (AGE) and the role it plays in the aging of long-lived proteins and nucleic acids. In contrast to the Amadori product, which is in equilibrium with glucose, AGE is irreversibly attached to the proteins. The AGE moieties are brown, fluorescent chromophores that can cross-link proteins. We have identified and characterized two specific AGE glucose-derived cross-links in proteins 2-furoyl-4(5)-(2-furanyl)-1H-imidazole (FFI) and 1-alkyl-2-formyl-3,4-diglycosylpyrrole (AFGP). By use of a radioimmunoassay for FFI identification, it has been possible to demonstrate the presence of FFI in situ in proteins that had been exposed to glucose in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we found that reducing sugars react with amino groups on DNA nucleotides in a manner analogous to the nonenzymatic glycosylation of amino groups on proteins. The AGE-DNA formed in this manner has spectral and fluorescent properties similar to those of AGE-proteins. We have observed that formation of AGE on DNA decreases the ability of the single-stranded virus f1 to transfect Escherichia coli. When the plasmid pBR322 containing ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant genes is incubated with reducing sugars, specific mutations are observed. These mutations have been found to be caused by insertions and deletions of the DNA. Further studies are needed for measuring the amounts of AGE-DNA and proteins linked to DNA by AGE. Potential mechanisms for repair of AGE-DNA also needs to be explored further.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This platinum complex is less nephrotoxic, ototoxic, and neurotoxic than cisplatin. Myelosuppression may be severe and dose-limiting. Carboplatin distributes into a volume approximating total body water, and is slowly bound to plasma proteins; its elimination is a biphasic process. Renal clearance of free platinum from carboplatin correlates highly with creatinine clearance in patients with normal or impaired renal function. The recommended iv dose of carboplatin as a single agent in previously untreated patients is 400-500 mg/m2; dosage must be reduced in patients with decreased renal function, low initial platelet count, or extensive prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Carboplatin will be most useful in patients with decreased renal function and those who cannot tolerate high-volume hydration regimens. Patients at higher risk for development of cisplatin-related ototoxicity or neurotoxicity (e.g., patients expected to receive cumulative cisplatin doses exceeding 600-800 mg/m2) may be ideal candidates for carboplatin as initial therapy. Large-scale comparative trials are needed before carboplatin can be recommended as a replacement for cisplatin.\r"

It is currently the eighth largest-selling drug and the most frequently used NSAID in the world. Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative, is a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase enzyme activity, and may also interact with the lipoxygenase enzyme pathway, and with the release and reuptake of arachidonic acid. Diclofenac is almost completely absorbed, highly protein-bound, penetrates well into synovial fluid, and is extensively metabolized. Comparative studies have shown that diclofenac is at least equivalent in efficacy to aspirin and other NSAID when used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Diclofenac also possesses potent analgesic properties. Clinical trials suggest that diclofenac has a favorable side-effect profile, excellent patient tolerability, and a lower patient dropout rate when compared with aspirin and other NSAID.\r"

Etoposide for oral use has become commercially available and is approved for use in the treatment of SCLC. Although no clinical trials comparing intravenous and oral etoposide in SCLC have been reported, several pharmacokinetic studies have been described. These studies have demonstrated a mean bioavailability of 50 percent, with a wide range among patients. Other pharmacokinetic parameters are similar for both the intravenous and oral methods of administration. Based on these results, the recommended dose of oral etoposide is twice the intravenous dose. Oral etoposide has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of SCLC. It offers a reasonable and cost-effective outpatient alternative for this group of patients.\r"

Following this protocol, a 10 mg/kg loading dose of quinidine gluconate followed by a 0.02 mg/kg/min continuous infusion was administered to a 53-year-old man with severe life-threatening chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria.

Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigations of the cellular composition of epimyoepithelial islands were carried out on three examples of benign lymphoepithelial lesions with varying histologic features. The monoclonal anti-keratin antibody 312C8-1, which specifically decorates myoepithelial cells of the normal salivary gland, also stains the myoepithelial cells surrounding residual acini and intercalated ducts in benign lymphoepithelial lesions and the cell population of epimyoepithelial islands, with the exception of persisting luminal epithelial cells. Ultrastructurally, the myoepithelial cells of involuting acini and ducts and the modified myoepithelial cells of epimyoepithelial islands, identified in both locations by the monoclonal antibody 312C8-1, show an increasing complement of tonofilament bundles. In addition, persisting lumens (often distended with lymphocytes) and definite luminal epithelial cells can be seen in electron micrographs of some epimyoepithelial islands. The designation for this characteristic epithelial feature of benign lymphoepithelial lesions is therefore appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "During the 30-year period 1955-1985, 21 children with neoplasms of the major salivary glands were treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. A thorough review of the English literature revealed an additional 472 cases. The cases were studied as to age, sex, site, histopathologic characteristics, mode of treatment, and results. The majority of the patients were between 8 and 20 years of age. There was a female preponderance of 1.42:1. The parotid gland was the site of origin in 85.1%, the submandibular in 11.7%, and the sublingual in 3.2%. An equal incidence of benign (50.1%) and malignant (49.9%) lesions is noted. Pleomorphic adenoma was the most common benign neoplasm and mucoepidermoid carcinoma the most common malignant neoplasm. The final prognosis seems to be similar with superficial or total parotidectomy, provided the tumor has been completely removed at the initial surgery. Re-excision is recommended for tumor recurrence, and the use of radiation therapy should be individually determined in cases of aggressive malignancies.\r"

  ".U": "89177788\r", 
  ".W": "Addiction consists of a complex neuropharmacologic behavioral cycle. The positive reinforcement of the drug and the negative reinforcement of withdrawal serve to drive the behavior of obtaining and ingesting the drug. The pharmacological adjuncts that are available today work by interfering with one or another part of the cycle. The alpha 2-adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine and guanabenz, act to block noradrenergic activity in the locus coeruleus and therefore block the negative reinforcement of opioid withdrawal. Naltrexone, on the other hand, works by preventing the positive reinforcement of administered opioids by preventing them from binding to the opioid receptor. In the case of cocaine addiction, most of the adjuncts currently in use focus on decreasing the severity of the immediate withdrawal symptoms. These agents potentiate dopaminergic transmission and in so doing tend to counter the dopamine depletion effect of prolonged cocaine use. Bromocriptine is the best known and probably the most effective member of this class. It may be that neuroleptics or naltrexone will prove to decrease reinforcement of cocaine use. However, the hazards of long-term neuroleptic use make it unlikely that they will be widely used for this purpose. Desipramine and perhaps other antidepressants may have a special role in treating cocaine addiction: They may prove to have some long-term prophylactic value and prevent relapse in recovering addicts. This ability may stem from the antidepressant action or it may involve a more specific action on dopaminergic transmission. These pharmacological agents may be very effective for certain purposes, such as relieving withdrawal symptoms. However, since they only act on one part of the addiction cycle, they can never be considered complete treatment by themselves. Of course, the use of all of these agents requires the voluntary cooperation of the patient. Therefore, the basis of the treatment of addictive illness continues to be the peer group and other types of interpersonal interactions. However, these pharmacological adjuncts may serve to make treatment easier, shorter and less expensive, and they may improve overall success rates. Consequently, they are of great value in the present and they can serve as models for the development of more effective agents in the future.\r"

  ".U": "89177789\r", 
  ".W": "Disulfiram is a potent alcohol-sensitizing drug, the effectiveness of which remains unproven in the treatment of alcoholism after 40 years of use. Its clinical utility is more closely associated with nonspecific, nonpharmacological factors (such as social class, patient compliance, patient personality characteristics, and treatment structure) than with its aversive biochemistry. Disulfiram is not effective as a sole alternative to a structured treatment program. Disulfiram retains a place in standard alcoholism treatment programs because clinicians have found this agent useful for selected alcoholic patients. Clinical studies and clinical lore describe these patients as older, relapse-prone, socially stable, cognitively intact, not depressed, compulsive, capable of following rules, and tolerant of dependence. Another distinctly responsive (but evasive) group is court-probated patients. These characteristics also describe patients who are well-known to have good outcomes without disulfiram, thus they do not help clinicians to select suitable patients for this medication. Consequently, this article proposes the following selection criteria: (1) patients who can tolerate a treatment relationship; (2) patients who are relapse-prone (but in treatment); (3) patients who have failed with less structured approaches; (4) patients in early abstinence who are in crisis or under severe stress; (5) patients in established recovery for whom individual or group psychotherapy is a relapse risk; and (6) patients who specifically request it. With or without disulfiram, a treatment program needs to be highly structured and predictable in order to be useful to newly recovering patients. Recovery is a process with discernible phases of development, and the provision of structure is the core of early treatment, where behavior change is more important than insight. A well-structured program will have phases through which a patient may progress. Generally speaking, disulfiram is most useful early to establish sobriety and to allow time for other support structures, such as AA, therapist-patient relationships, and new personal relationships, to take hold. Disulfiram is best given to patients with prior treatment failures, early in treatment, briefly during crises in established sobriety, or to support unusual stresses, such as psychotherapy. Prescriptions should be short-term and not allow automatic refills. It should be necessary to attend a treatment program in order to obtain them. Supervision and monitoring dramatically increase compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Each completed a 50-item rheumatology quiz and performed a clinical assessment of a trained patient evaluator. Trainees in internal medicine had quiz and clinical assessment scores of 52.4% and 72.9%, respectively, while scores for family practice trainees were 43.4% and 61.6% (p less than 0.004 for both). Regression analysis showed that having had a rheumatology elective had a significant effect on knowledge and skills. Trainees in family practice programs were 3 times less likely than internal medicine trainees to have taken a rheumatology elective. Family practice trainee scores in our study were comparable to scores previously documented in 4th year medical students. These results confirm the importance of a specific rheumatology experience for the development of rheumatology knowledge and skills in internal medicine and family practice trainees, and suggest that the rheumatology content of these training programs needs to be enhanced.\r"

Virtually all aspects of the human sexual response are affected by alcohol and drugs: 1. Desire (libido) is reduced. 2. Performance. Impotency as defined by lack of erection and ejaculation occurs. 3. Dissatisfaction ensues. These effects of alcohol and drugs can be understood and illustrated by examining the phases of excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution in the human sexual response. The important first step in the treatment of sexual dysfunction is to identify the alcohol/drug/medication use. The next is to recognize the profound effect it can have on the human sexual response. Furthermore, knowledge of the mechanism of action of the drugs and a basic conception of the physiology and psychology of sexual performance are necessary to predict the course of the sexual dysfunction. In many instances, the sexual dysfunction is reversible even after chronic alcohol/drug/medication use.\r"

The third path results in a particular variety of alcohol abuse in men and a particular variety of somatization in women. This article analyzes the authors' claims. It is argued that the data were improperly analyzed for the conclusions reached and alternative parsimonious explanations for the results are offered. Although the Swedish studies do not offer support for three distinct paths of inheritance of alcoholism, they do support the inheritability of alcoholism and suggest that alcoholism may be linked with somatization in women. Unfortunately, reasonable questions can be raised about the generalizability of the data base.\r"

The effects of factors other than inaccurate reporting, such as the range of values for reported daily drinks and subjects' drinking patterns, on the correlation coefficients for all subject-days and for individual subjects in the citalopram study are discussed. Sampling 50% or fewer of the 84 days of the citalopram study for each subject is economically advantageous and did not significantly change the values of the correlation coefficients or the rank positions of subjects but did increase the 95% confidence intervals for the correlation coefficients, indicating less certainty about the actual correlation coefficients and, therefore, the accuracy of a subject's self-report.

Disulfiram administered in this way is unlikely to produce a significant reaction with ethanol, but its value as a placebo should not be discounted. In this pilot trial, the technique caused moderate local and systemic reactions and possible hepatic toxicity. Although in other respects the method is superior to surgical implants, modification of dosage and vehicle will be necessary, and the high incidence and severity of side effects preclude further clinical use of disulfiram in this form. Based on the work of Gordis and Peterson, a qualitative and quantitative thin-layer chromatographic urine assay method for the disulfiram metabolite diethylamine, measured as cupric diethyldithiocarbamate, was developed. This is practicable in a hospital laboratory situation and has application for compliance testing in patients on oral disulfiram.\r"

Further investigation of the exercise-induced increase in myocardial cyclic AMP indicates that the nucleotide content remained elevated long after (24 h) termination of exercise. This increase in cyclic AMP was time dependent, with the level increasing gradually throughout the work bout. The increase in cardiac cyclic AMP seemed to be independent of work intensity, provided that work time was of sufficient duration (greater than or equal to 30 min). Increases in cardiac cyclic AMP were also seen when rats were exposed to 2 degrees C for 1-7 d. The increases in cyclic AMP seen following exercise and cold exposure were accompanied by an increase in cardiac cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. Our working hypothesis was that prolonged elevations in cyclic AMP produced an induction and/or activation of one or more of the PDE isozymes. When we administered dibutyryl cyclic AMP to rats, cardiac PDE activity was increased. This increase was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that the elevated enzyme activity is mediated by the synthesis of new protein. These data support the concept that cyclic AMP is involved in the regulation of its own metabolism during physiological stress.\r"

  ".W": "Adipocytes from trained rats release more free fatty acids in response to hormonal challenge compared to fat cells from sedentary rats. Lipolysis results from increased triglyceride hydrolysis that is catalyzed by a hormone-sensitive lipase, which, in turn, is activated by a phosphorylation mechanism involving cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Cyclic AMP levels within the fat cell are regulated by beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase interactions and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity. This review focuses on cyclic AMP regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes from trained and sedentary animals. Although lipolysis is elevated in fat cells from trained rats, no differences are found in beta-adrenergic receptor number or affinity, adenylate cyclase activity, protein kinase activity, or partially purified hormone-sensitive lipase activity when compared to sedentary rats. The major lipolytic alteration induced by exercise training appears to occur at a site distal to hormonal regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor.\r"

Over the past 8 yr, work in our laboratory has focused on intracellular lipoprotein lipase (LPL). The results show that this lipase is regulated by the classical cAMP cascade and that the activity of this enzyme is inversely related to endogenous TG concentration. Using these results as a foundation we plan to examine molecular mechanisms involved in the synthesis, compartmentalization, and transport of the alkaline TG lipase. Further, the evidence suggests that this enzyme may be regulated by protein phosphorylation mediated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. We plan to test this possibility.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclic AMP increases in liver during exercise, the magnitude of the increase being dependent on duration and intensity of the exercise. Within limits, the increase in cAMP is closely correlated with the rate of glycogenolysis and with the exercise intensity. It is unlikely that epinephrine is involved in determining cAMP concentration in liver during exercise. Adrenodemedullated rats show no impairment in exercise-induced liver glycogenolysis or in the increase in cAMP. When epinephrine is infused at different rates into exercising rats, liver cAMP appears to be unrelated to plasma epinephrine. The rise in plasma glucagon is likely responsible for the increase in hepatic cAMP during exercise. The increase in cAMP is apparently necessary for maintaining low levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (the activator of PFK-1 and inhibitor of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate) in liver. The low fructose-2,6-bisphosphate concentration would be expected to result in an increase rate of gluconeogenesis during exercise.\r"

The less selected American dancers reported significantly more eating problems (46% vs 11%; P less than 0.05), anorectic behaviors (2.77 vs 1.11; P less than 0.05), and familial obesity (42% vs 5%; P less than 0.05) than the Americans chosen from a company school. Differences were not found on these variables between the highly selected American and Chinese dancers. All of the groups reported a delay in menarche and weighed approximately 14% below their ideal weight for height. These data suggest that dancers who have survived a stringent process of early selection may be more naturally suited to the thin body image demanded by ballet and so less at risk for the development of eating problems. In addition, delayed menarche is typical of the majority of national dancers and probably is reflective of genetic and environmental factors.\r"

  ".W": "Although there have been numerous studies of the moments of inertia of the body segments using a variety of the techniques, few have reported the principal moments and none has considered the changes in the principal moments during childhood and adolescence. The purpose of this study was to use a mathematical model to determine the intraindividual changes and interindividual differences in the segment principal moments during growth. The body was modelled as 15 segments and composed of transverse elliptical zones of known density. Moments and products of inertia about the segment mass centroid were calculated and the principal moments and axes determined from the ellipsoid of inertia. A mixed longitudinal study of 12 boys over 9 yr for a total of 88 annual recordings covering the age range 4 to 20 yr was conducted. Polynomial regressions fitted to the intraindividual changes showed a similarity in the curves to 10 yr followed by a wide divergence of growth patterns. The changes in the principal moments across age follow the principles of cephalocaudad and distal to proximal development for all three axes. These changes are more accentuated than the changes for segment length, volume, or mass. The results were consistent with principal moments reported for cadavers and young male adult gamma radiation scans as well as estimates based on simplified models of the segments. The magnitude of the changes in principal moments with age makes it essential that appropriate parameters be used in the analysis or simulation of the movements of children and adolescents.\r"

Flash ERGs are elicited by high intensity flashes either on scotopic or photopic conditions. The origin of the A and B waves of ERG are a combination of photoreceptor potentials, K+ mediated current flow and DC potentials within Muller cells, whereas the C waves are altered K+ fluxes induced by light in the pigment epithelia. Oscillatory potentials are probably related to feedback circuits of the inner layer of the retina. Electroretinograms evoked by pattern are mostly originated in ganglion cells. The use of various visual stimuli allow the selective activation of different retinal structures. Flashes selectively activate retina luminance and color detectors, whereas small pattern stimuli preferentially activate contrast and edge detectors. Visual evoked potentials recorded from the scalp probably originate from multiple cortical visual areas. P-100 response of the visual evoked potential to pattern stimulation is a cortically originated wave either produced exclusively by area 17 or 18 or by a multiplicity of cortical neuronal pools. Visual evoked potentials have important application for the diagnosis of optic nerve disease, assessment in conjunction with pattern ERG of the prognosis of recovery of visual function, and the evaluation of visual physiology and physiopathology.\r"

SEP abnormalities are useful in detecting lesions in central somatosensory pathways. They do not establish a specific diagnosis, but they may suggest or support a diagnosis made on clinical grounds. They have been used particularly to detect subclinical lesions in multiple sclerosis, but their role in following the course of this disorder is unclear. SEPs have been used as a prognostic guide in patients with hemispheric stroke and in patients who are comatose following head injury or severe cerebral anoxia; in such instances, however, the SEP often adds little to what can be determined by clinical examination. Their role in the evaluation of patients with brain death is controversial. Preserved SEPs or their early return after a spinal injury suggests an incomplete lesion, and therefore a better prognosis than otherwise. SEPs have been used to minimize or prevent intraoperative neurologic complications by monitoring spinal cord function, but their role in this regard awaits adequate validation. In patients with cervical spondylosis, SEPs elicited by stimulation of a nerve in the lower extremities may be helpful in indicating which patients are liable to develop a significant cord deficit, so that surgical treatment can be considered at an early stage. SEP abnormalities have been described in a number of other neurologic contexts, but the findings may be of more academic than clinical relevance in that they help to define the extent of neuropathologic involvement without altering the management of individual patients.\r"

By reason of central amplification they can indicate return of nerve continuity following trauma before peripheral sensory action potentials are recordable. For the same reason, it is possible to use them to measure peripheral sensory conduction velocity when conventional methods cannot be applied. They are helpful in the localization of plexopathies. Considerable effort has been devoted to their use in radiculopathies, but, for the most part, their role here is limited.\r"

Such monitoring can alert the surgical team to the presence of complications, allowing prompt correction in some cases so as to prevent postoperative neurologic deficits. Monitoring can be done from stimulation of either the lower or upper extremity. Recordings can be taken over the scalp or can be made from electrodes put into the surgical site itself. Monitoring of the spinal cord is most often done for surgery involving scoliosis, spinal tumors, or arteriovenous malformations, and during crossclamping of the thoracic aorta. Animal models and human surgical experience has shown that monitoring the posterior columns is an effective way to assess the status of the motor pathways of the spinal cord, because the two pathways are both affected in almost all acute circumstances. Monitoring can also assess the functional status of the cerebral hemispheres. This is most often applied during carotid endarterectomy or repair of aneurysms of the carotid artery and its branches. Occasionally, this has also been applied to monitoring the cortex during cardiopulmonary bypass. Such EP monitoring does not cover the wide areas of cortex that can be monitored using EEG, but the EPs do tend to change and disappear at a level of ischemia nearer to the true critical level. Intraoperative median nerve EPs can also be used to identify the hand level of the motor and somatosensory cortex. Such identification of motor cortex can help guide neurosurgeons in their choice of how or where to perform a biopsy, excision, and the like. Overall, intraoperative evoked potential monitoring is becoming widespread because it is a practical way to help avoid neurologic complications, and it can be carried out using equipment already available in many hospitals. A substantial further review in this field can be found in Evoked Potential Monitoring in the Operating Room.\r"

The INAP recording identifies functional axons within neuromas before other signs of reinnervation have developed. In clinically complete lesions, recording an INAP across the injury indicates the presence of regenerating axons, and neurolysis of the encasing connective tissue is recommended. If an INAP is absent, resection of the dense neuroma is usually undertaken with end-to-end suture or graft. A present INAP indicates clinically significant regenerating axons even with large distances to target tissue. An absent INAP for injuries far from target tissue indicates a poor prognosis. In clinically incomplete lesions, INAP recording is of no value over the clinical examination and EMG/NCS. INAP can aid peripheral nerve tumor resection by identification of intact nerve fascicles. INAP responses are obtained by placing platinum-iridium bipolar stimulating electrodes proximal to the injury. The INAP is then recorded by distal electrodes. A standard EMG/NCS instrument with an isolated stimulation unit can be used with the appropriate gain and time base settings. Stimulus intensity required for a supramaximal response is usually less than 75 V at 0.05 msec duration. Frequency bandpass is similar to that for conventional EMG/NCS studies. Electrodes must elevate the nerve during the recording. Artifact from 60 Hz line frequency and stimulus are common problems.\r"

Enzyme activities per unit length of unconstricted nerve were not different from those of nondiabetic mice. The nerves of diabetic mice did not accumulate measurable amounts of sorbitol or fructose and showed no myo-inositol depletion. Thus this study concludes that, in diabetic mice, the deficits in anterograde axonal transport of these two enzymes do not arise from the accumulation of sorbitol and fructose nor from depletion of nerve free myo-inositol.\r"

  ".W": "The use of the musculus tibialis anterior during walking and the type and size of its muscle fibers were determined in 15 young normal subjects (29 +/- 4 years) and in 13 old healthy subjects (70 +/- 3 years). In the average step cycle 16 +/- 6% of the maximal surface EMG was recorded during the swing phase and 44 +/- 15% during 100 msec at the heel strike. Single motor unit recordings showed that low-threshold units fired at 10-15 Hz during the swing and at 20-25 Hz during the heel strike peak. Usually, high-threshold units did not participate in the ordinary step cycle. A significantly higher mean use was found in the old subjects as compared with the young ones presumably due to lower muscle power in relation to body weight. In the young subjects 76 +/- 7% of the muscle fibers were type 1 and 22 +/- 7% were type 2A. In the old subjects 84 +/- 9% were type 1 and 15 +/- 8% were type 2A. In the young subjects the mean cross-sectional area of type 1 fibers was 3950 +/- 950 microns2 and of type 2 fibers was 8070 +/- 1850 microns2. In the old subjects the corresponding numerals were 4050 +/- 890 microns2 and 5700 +/- 1970 microns2, respectively. The significance of physiological variations in use for muscle fiber type composition and size is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89187646\r", 
  ".W": "A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of nedocromil sodium was undertaken to assess its corticosteroid sparing effect in 50 adults with asthma who had required an oral corticosteroid dose of (or equivalent to) at least 5 mg prednisolone a day continuously during the preceding year, in addition to inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate and bronchodilators. Patients having corticosteroids other than prednisolone were changed to prednisolone. A four week baseline period was followed by 20 weeks of inhaled nedocromil sodium (16 mg daily) or placebo. After four weeks of the treatment phase an attempt was made to reduce the oral prednisolone maintenance dose by 2.5 mg a fortnight until a dose of 5 mg daily was reached and thereafter by 1 mg a fortnight, provided that there was no significant clinical deterioration as judged by clinic assessments and daily diary cards. Of 50 patients recruited, 47 entered the treatment phase (age range 16-64 years), 24 receiving nedocromil sodium and 23 placebo. The total steroid reduction achieved was 2.5 mg in the nedocromil group and 3 mg in the placebo group, which did not differ significantly. There was no significant change in symptoms, lung function or inhaler use in either group during the study. The number of patient requiring short term upward adjustment of booster doses of oral prednisolone for exacerbations of asthma was similar in the two groups (26 with placebo, 28 with nedocromil). Thus nedocromil sodium does not appear to provide an oral corticosteroid sparing effect in chronic steroid dependent asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Sport and medicine in ancient Greece were the result of a widespread tradition of liberty, which was at the heart of one of the most brilliant civilizations in history. Whereas war encouraged the development of surgical knowledge springing out of medical experience on the battlefield, peace promoted the burgeoning of sport as an integral part of Greek upbringing, allowing the channeling of young people's aggressiveness into physical competition. Medicine was magical and mythological, especially in the time of Homer (9th century BC); Aesculapius, the mythical god of healing, was its reference point. With Hippocrates (5th century BC), the body of medical experience was to be codified and built up, and was to undergo a novel evolution based on the theory of the balance of the four humors. The athlete's mentality, faced with trauma in the sports ground, underwent a change; injury was no longer considered a punishment by the gods. At the same time, temple offerings tendered in the hope of victory gave way to the athlete's personal preparation based on a specifically modified lifestyle, diet, and training. The resulting progress in medicine and public health, especially from the 5th century BC onward, was not only to favor athletic performances of high quality but also surgical techniques that were very advanced for their time. Thus it can be seen that the medical knowledge associated with the practice of sport progressed during antiquity because of its obligation to follow the warrior and then the athlete.\r"

The average duration of the paratenonitis was 20.4 months. The paratendineal fatty areolar tissue was clearly thickened and edematous, showing widespread fat necrosis and considerable connective tissue proliferation. The blood vessels were often obliterated and degenerated. Fibronectin and fibrinogen were commonly found in the proliferating connective tissue areas and in the vascular walls. Exudates rich in fibrinogen and fibronectin were seen in the inflamed paratendineal tissues, but not in the controls. The results indicate that increased vascular permeability and fibrin formation still persist in chronic Achilles paratenonitis and that marked obliterative and degenerative alterations of the blood vessels are frequent. The presence of fibronectin and fibrinogen points to an immature nature of scar tissue in chronic paratenonitis.\r"

In 18 of the 25 patients, only 1 knee was affected; in 7 of the patients, both knees were affected, thus making a total of 32 painful tendons. These 25 patients were compared with a control group of 15 healthy, athletically active subjects between the ages of 25 and 35 years old. In all of the 32 painful tendons, ultrasonographic anomalies were observed: thickening or swelling of the tendon (15 knees) appeared in acute cases; a heterogeneous structure of the tendon (24 knees); and thickening and irregularities of the tendinous envelope (8 knees). The 15 acute patients all responded to classic conservative treatment including physical therapy and electrotherapy. Four of the remaining 10 patients were treated successfully with various conservative treatments, including deep transverse friction massage with ice. The other six patients were treated surgically, with tenolysis and \"carding\" of the patellar tendon. In one patient, this procedure failed, and 12 months later a second operation was performed, in which the distal pole of the patella was resected and the patellar tendon reinserted into bone. Recovery was uneventful. Now, at least 2 years after treatment, all of the patients consider themselves healed.\r"

The anti-human PrP antiserum reacted with the plaques in CJD and GSS, with or without degenerative neurites (neuritic components). In addition, the anti-beta protein antiserum immunolabeled kuru plaque-like compact plaques in some cases of CJD. Therefore, previous morphological classifications of the plaques may not always be valid. Senile plaques labeled with anti-beta protein antiserum were evident in 65% of the CJD brains and 50% of GSS brains from patients in their 60s, and in 73% of brains from CJD patients in their 70s, but not in brains from patients under 60 years of age. The incidence of the senile plaques was compatible with the normal aging process and was apparently not accelerated by the disease process of CJD or GSS. These immunostaining approaches using anti-human PrP and anti-beta protein antisera allow classification of plaque types and increase the reliability of the pathological diagnosis in persons with dementia.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor has been implicated in the sequence of neurochemical events that results in irreversible neuronal damage in cerebral ischemia. The effects of the NMDA antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) upon the amount of ischemic brain damage has been assessed quantitatively in the lightly anesthetized rat. Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by the permanent occlusion of one middle cerebral artery (MCA), and the animals were killed 3 hours after the arterial occlusion. MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously either 30 minutes prior to MCA occlusion or 30 minutes after the induction of ischemia. Pretreatment with MK-801 reduced the volume of ischemic damage both in the cerebral cortex (by 38% compared with untreated rats with MCA occlusion; p less than 0.01) and in the caudate nucleus (by 18% compared with controls; p less than 0.05). Treatment with MK-801, initiated 30 minutes after MCA occlusion, reduced the volume of ischemic damage in the cerebral cortex (by 52% compared with controls; p less than 0.01). The volume of ischemic damage in the caudate nucleus was minimally influenced by MK-801 treatment initiated after MCA occlusion. The antiischemic effects of MK-801 were readily demonstrable despite the hypotension that MK-801 induced in rats anesthetized with halothane (0.5%), nitrous oxide (70%), and oxygen (30%). The potency of MK-801 in reducing ischemic brain damage, even when administered after the induction of ischemia, highlights the potential use of NMDA receptor antagonists for the treatment of focal cerebral ischemia in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that usually begins in mid-life and is characterized by progressive choreiform movements and dementia. Approximately 5% of patients develop symptoms prior to 14 years of age. In most juvenile cases, the gene is transmitted from the father. In children the clinical course is marked by mental deterioration or behavioral abnormalities, gait disturbances usually the consequence of rigidity, cerebellar signs, and seizures. The pathologic findings are highlighted by atrophy of the caudate. Atrophy also is observed on brain imaging, while positron emission tomography demonstrates marked caudate hypometabolism which antedates the appearance of the clinical disease. Cell death in the striatum primarily affects medium and small GABA-containing neurons, representing the striatal output projections. Somatostatin-containing neurons and cholinergic neurons are spared. The gene for Huntington disease has been localized in close proximity to the tip of the short arm of chromosome 4. The gene product and the manner by which it induces selective cell death is still unknown but should become evident in the near future.\r"

Electrophysiologic techniques are the most suitable of available methods for uninterrupted surveillance of brain function. Although the use of routine electroencephalography for this purpose is impractical, automated electroencephalographic signal analysis and application of digital computer technology have made continuous monitoring of cerebral function feasible. Various methods of displaying modified electroencephalographic data in an understandable and interpretable form have been developed; the most commonly used devices are the cerebral function monitor and the compressed spectral array. Practical clinical applications and limitations of continuous cerebral function monitoring are discussed.\r"

Epidemics occur when immunization rates fall. Whole-cell vaccine has proved to be a safe and effective method of disease control. Whole-cell vaccines have been used because the bacterial components responsible for immunity have not been identified. New component vaccines have not been licensed in the United States because they do not meet standards for efficacy. Whole-cell pertussis vaccine has been associated with febrile and afebrile seizures which are generalized and occur within 72 hours of immunization. Permanent brain damage caused by pertussis vaccine is rare. One study suggested a risk of 1:310,000 immunizations which is not precise and probably excessive; however, even using this figure, the risk-benefit ratio for 3 immunizations is favorable when compared to the risks of the natural disease. Child neurologists should recommended immunization for brain damaged infants with static or chronic brain syndromes. Pertussis immunization should be delayed or omitted when the neurologic status is unclear.\r"

In addition, he had visceromegaly, bilateral inguinal hernias, and a slight gibbus deformity. Lymphocytes were vacuolated and bone marrow contained large numbers of foam cells. There were generalized vacuolations of both reticuloendothelial and parenchymal cells in the examined tissues. Neuropathologic studies revealed wide-spread neuronal storage, myelin loss, axonal spheroids, and gliosis. Neurons, endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells stained with wheat germ agglutinin indicated an accumulation of sialic acid. Free sialic acid was significantly increased in urine and serum, as well as in liver, heart, and brain tissues. The alpha-neuraminidase activity was normal. It is assumed that the basic defect of infantile sialic acid storage disease lies in impaired transport of sialic acid across the lysosomal membrane.\r"

The ontogeny of electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep in the neonate can be monitored by serial EEG/polygraphic recordings. A variety of physiologic markers accompany neonatal sleep, such as specific EEG patterns, rapid eye movements, arousals, autonomic signs, and body movements. These parameters vary in occurrence and abundance during different segments of the neonatal sleep cycle. Time-dependent interrelationships among these different physiologic components can be assessed by visual inspection of EEG recordings to monitor specific patterns that appear during one or more sleep cycles. Mathematical modeling and computer technologies permit the study of interactions among neurophysiologic signals which are not apparent by visual inspection. An understanding of biological rhythm relationships among different sleep events offers insights into the effects of extrauterine environment on the development of the central nervous system in the healthy preterm neonate and the disturbances in the sleep EEG rhythm in abnormal neonates. Sleep EEG analysis may be useful prognostically because \"normalization\" of abnormal EEG patterns often occurs following the initial acute illness. Suitable, normative data from very premature neonates are needed before pediatric neurologists can rely on neonatal EEG as an indicator of brain maturation in this low-birth weight group. An understanding of the biologic significance of the ontogeny of neonatal sleep, as well as the clinical significance of perturbations in this sleep cycle with disease, will lead to more reliable analyses of sleep physiology for research and clinical purposes.\r"

The diagnosis is documented by performance of an exercise challenge test such as a treadmill or cycloergometer to verify bronchospasm induced by exercise. The management can be accomplished by nonpharmacologic means such as an early vigorous warmup, the use of a mask for rebreathing warmed air, and participation in a physical training program to increase anaerobic fitness. Pharmacologic management includes the appropriate use of cromolyn sodium, beta adrenergic agonists, theophylline, ipratroprium bromide, and calcium channel blocking agents. In addition the antihistamine, terfenadine, can also be utilized to effectively block exercise-induced bronchospasm. These pharmacologic agents can be utilized in both national and international competition when approved by the appropriate national governing body and/or the US Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee.\r"

Twenty patients ultimately received a total of 26 cadaveric renal allografts. Graft survival at one year was 76%. One- and five-year patient survival was 92% and 73% respectively. Beyond 5 years a trend towards increased survival in the transplant group was seen, compared with the exclusively hemodialyzed group. Bilateral nephrectomy prior to transplantation was associated with high morbidity and mortality, and did not change either graft or patient survival. In view of the similar survival and because it is accepted that transplantation offers the highest quality of life amongst the modalities of treatment for end-stage renal failure, transplantation should be considered the treatment of choice for end-stage ADPKD. There is no justification for routine bilateral nephrectomy before renal transplantation.\r"

CD16-positive NK/K cells were rarely encountered. The CD4/CD8 ratio was consistently higher than 1.0 (mean 2.08). The lymphocytes which invaded the tubular epithelial cells to present a feature of tubulitis were CD8-positive, suggesting that they were cytotoxic T-cells. These results were in general accord with those obtained in the salivary glands of patients with Sjogren's syndrome. It was thus concluded that the same immunological process was probably operative in the renal tubulointerstitial tissue as in the salivary glands to induce the characteristic tissue changes of Sjogren's syndrome.\r"

Enterohepatic recirculation of ursodiol and its metabolites occurs and is essential to the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones. Complete dissolution has been achieved in 17 percent of patients with noncalcified, radiolucent, floating, cholesterol gallstones. Recurrence of cholesterol gallstones may occur in over one-half of initial responders. Diarrhea reported in up to 50 percent of the patients on chenodiol has been reported in only 4 percent of patients treated with ursodiol. Increased mean aspartate aminotransferase levels to more than twice the pretreatment level seen with chenodiol therapy have not been reported with ursodiol.

Fibrin glue is available in Europe but is not commercially available in the U.S.; therefore, investigators have extemporaneously compounded their own fibrin glue. Fibrinogen can be obtained from pooled, single-donor, and autologous blood donors and is usually isolated by the process of cryoprecipitation. The thrombin component is generally derived from commercial bovine sources. Some investigators have added calcium chloride and/or antifibrinolytics (i.e., aminocaproic acid, aprotinin) to their preparations. Fibrin glue can be applied using a double-barrel syringe or by spray application. Although fibrin glue has been used in a variety of surgical procedures, it has been especially useful in heparinized patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures requiring extracorporeal circulation, as it does not require an intact hemostatic system to be effective. Fibrin glue also has been evaluated in presealing woven or knitted Dacron vascular grafts. The major drawback to its use is the risk of transmitted serological disease from pooled and single-donor blood donors. The safest preparations use the patient's own blood to prepare fibrin glue. Overall, fibrin glue is a useful adjunct to other methods to control bleeding in selected surgical patients.\r"
