  ".W": "'McIntyre Powder' (finely ground aluminium and aluminium oxide) was used as a prophylactic agent against silicotic lung disease between 1944 and 1979 in mines in northern Ontario. To find out whether the practice produced neurotoxic effects a morbidity prevalence study was conducted between 1988 and 1989. There were no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed miners in reported diagnoses of neurological disorder; however, exposed miners performed less well than did unexposed workers on cognitive state examinations; also, the proportion of men with scores in the impaired range was greater in the exposed than non-exposed group. Likelihood of scores in the impaired range increased with duration of exposure. The findings are consistent with putative neurotoxicity of chronic aluminium exposure.\r"

After a successful trial of active immunisation against the beta toxin of the causative organism, Clostridium perfringens type C, immunisation of children was begun in 1980. The effects of the immunisation programme on pigbel admissions in 3 of the 5 major highland hospitals were assessed. In each of the centres studied the proportion of admissions due to enteritis necroticans dropped significantly after immunisation was introduced (p less than 0.001) and hospital admissions for pigbel in 1984-86, when immunisation was well established, were less than one fifth of previous figures.\r"

The proportions of M-types 1, 3, and 18 increased significantly during the study period. These M-types were more likely to be invasive, to cause fatal infection, and to occur in a cluster of infections than were other types. By contrast, the proportions of M-types 4 and 12 decreased; they were less invasive and were less likely to be found in clusters than were other types. These data suggest that changes in the epidemiology of group A streptococcal disease may be related to changes in the distribution of M-types causing infection.\r"

Patients of both groups reported closely similar experiences but patients who really were close to death were more likely than those who were not to report an enhanced perception of light and enhanced cognitive powers. The claim of enhancement of cognitive functions despite the likelihood that brain function had probably become disturbed and possibly diminished, deserves further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Two ELISAs were used to detect serum and urinary aspergillus antigen in 121 patients who were profoundly neutropenic after leukaemia therapy or bone marrow transplantation. The presence of antigen correctly predicted development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in 16 patients. In 2 other cases antigen appeared after the clinical diagnosis had been made, while in only 1 case was antigen not detected. In 11 of 13 episodes of clinically suspected fungal infection antigen was detected before clinical diagnosis was made. By contrast, antigen was detected in only 1 of 90 patients who had no evidence of IPA. Both ELISAs gave positive and negative predictive values for IPA of greater than 95%, demonstrating the value of antigen detection in early diagnosis of aspergillus infection and the assay's ability to predict subsequent development of IPA. We conclude that neutropenic patients should be screened for aspergillus antigen, and propose that initial detection of fungal antigen justifies commencement of empirical antifungal therapy. Such an approach should improve the survival of patients who are at risk of developing this usually fatal infection.\r"

During this period the overall frequency of cholecystectomy increased by 978%, a finding not explained by the 67% increase in population or the 87% increase in other operations. Simultaneously, the average daily individual consumption of total calories, fat, and sugar increased by 81%, 197%, and 164%, respectively, and consumption of high-fibre grain fell by 75%. This striking increase in the frequency of cholecystectomy, which presumably reflects the incidence of gallstones, cannot be explained by demographic changes and seems more closely linked to the concomitant changes in dietary habits.\r"

At the time of initial classification (6 months after notification), 104 patients were excluded. Of the remaining 1091 patients, 220 (20% [95% confidence interval 18-23%]) had febrile seizures, 564 (52% [49-55%]) definite epileptic seizures, and 228 (21% [19-23%]) possible epilepsy. In the definite epilepsy group the proportions of males and females were similar, 25% (21-28%) were younger than 15 years and 24% (21-28%) were 60 years or older. The definite seizures were classified as cryptogenic in 62% (58-66%), remote symptomatic in 21% (18-25%), and acute symptomatic in 15% (12-18%). The aetiology of epilepsy was vascular disease in 15% (12-18%) and tumour in 6% (4-8%). Among older subjects the proportion with an identifiable cause was much higher: 49% (41-58%) were due to vascular disease and 11% (6-16%) to tumour. Only 252 (45% [41-49%]) of the 564 patients with definite epileptic seizures were registered at the time of their first seizure. 52% (48-56%) of the patients had partial or secondarily generalised seizures, and only 39% (35-43%) seizures generalised from the outset.\r"

Seizures associated with a neurological deficit presumed present at birth had a high rate of recurrence (100% by 12 months), whereas seizures that occurred within 3 months of an acute insult to the brain, such as head injury or stroke, or in the context of an acute precipitant such as alcohol, carried a much lower risk of recurrence (40% [29-51%] by 12 months). Other factors affecting the risk of recurrence were age-the highest risk being for patients under the age of 16 (83% [77-89%] by 36 months) or over the age of 59 (83% [76-90%] by 36 months-and type of first seizure-the risk of recurrence being much higher for patients with simple partial or complex partial seizures (94% [90-99%] by 36 months) than for those with generalised tonic clonic seizures (72% [67-77%] by 36 months).\r"

Immediately after red-cell transfusion, 20 patients were randomised to receive either desferrioxamine (50 mg/kg daily as a 12 h subcutaneous infusion), or L1 (50 mg/kg daily by mouth). Patients were evaluated during treatment with the other drug after transfusion the next month. Mean (SD) daily urinary iron excretion was lower during L1 than during desferrioxamine (12.3 [6.7] vs 18.2 [15.3] mg/day). In 5 patients the dose of L1 was raised from 50 to 75 mg/kg daily; mean urinary iron excretion rose from 13.8 (7.0) mg/day to 26.7 (17.8) mg/day, comparable with that during desferrioxamine (24.9 [24.3] mg/day). Faecal iron excretion rose slightly over baseline in 6 patients studied during L1 administration (from 8.5 [0.9] mg/day to 12.2 [0.9] mg/day). Pharmacokinetic studies showed an elimination half-life for L1 of 117-237 min. Studies in dogs and in volunteers showed no absorption of the L1-iron complex, excluding a contribution of absorption of intraluminal complexes of L1 and food iron to urinary iron excretion. Further animal toxicity testing is needed before L1 can be studied in a broader group of patients.\r"

CMV genomic material was demonstrated in 7 of the 10 patients with RE (in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells) and in 2 of the 46 control patients. Probes for herpes simplex virus and hepatitis B virus were negative in all patients and in fibroblast controls. The results suggest that CMV is a likely cause of Rasmussen's encephalitis.\r"

  ".W": "A nationwide survey in Japan on child abuse and neglect revealed that 10% of the victims were products of multiple births. None of the victims who were singletons had multiple-birth siblings, and only in a few cases were both twins abused. The findings indicated that one rather than both of a pair of twins was likely to be abused in Japan. Abuse of both twins was likely when there were serious parental or family problems, whereas abuse of one twin was associated with the child's medical problems or non-home care. There was no instance of abuse of a pair of twins when both were handicapped. Comparisons of the abused twin with the non-abused co-twin and examination of the abuser's attitude to the victim suggested that the difference between twins in their development or in their response to parents increased the stress of child-rearing and encouraged favouritism, which resulted in abuse of only one twin. Comparison by parents of children with their siblings may be a common factor in general child abuse because it is a natural thing for parents to do.\r"

  ".W": "41 short normal children were randomly allocated either to daily injections of growth hormone (rhGH) at 30 IU/m2 per week or to no treatment. 6 months of rhGH therapy produced up to 76% loss of fat mass and up to 25% increase in lean body mass (LBM). These changes were significantly different from those in the untreated group. LBM was the main determinant of resting energy expenditure (REE) expressed as kJ/24 h. REE expressed as kJ/kg LBM per 24 h correlated negatively with height, which was responsible for 66% of the variance in REE kJ/kg LBM per 24 h. Short children therefore expend more energy than tall children in fulfilling basic metabolic needs. After 6 months REE kJ/24 h increased significantly in treated children. However, treated children did not differ significantly from untreated children in REE kJ/kg LBM per 24 h. rhGH does not therefore seem to have a specific effect upon REE. The possibility that rhGH produces profound metabolic effects should limit its use in otherwise healthy children until the mechanism of action is more clearly elucidated.\r"

Among 33 children with confirmed coeliac disease (ESPGAN criteria), 13 (93%) of 14 sampled before starting on a gluten-free diet had JAB, none of 21 sampled had JAB while on a gluten-free diet of long duration, and 90% of 30 sampled during gluten challenge had JAB. 53 children had severe jejunal villous atrophy (probable coeliac disease): 71% of those younger than 2 years and 94% of those aged 2-18 years had JAB during gluten intake. JAB could not be detected in 53 disease control patients (normal jejunal histology) and in 3 coeliac disease patients with selective IgA deficiency. Simultaneous determination of antigliadin (AGA) and antiendomysium (EMA) levels, and gliadin and tissue absorption studies, showed that JAB and AGA are different, whereas JAB and EMA are probably identical. IgA JAB could be the target-organ-related autoantibodies in coeliac disease.\r"

In a placebo-controlled study, salmeterol 50 micrograms inhaled before allergen challenge ablated both the early and late phase of allergen-induced bronchoconstriction over a 34 h time period. Salmeterol also completely inhibited the allergen-induced rise in non-specific bronchial responsiveness over the same time period. These effects were shown to be unrelated to prolonged bronchodilatation or functional antagonism. These data suggest novel actions for topically active long-acting beta 2-agonists in asthma that extend beyond their protective action on airways smooth muscle.\r"

All were seropositive, whereas 11 children of similar age with atopic eczema were all negative. In 2 of 2 cases of infective dermatitis, the biological mother was HTLV-1 seropositive. None of the 14 patients showed signs of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, though experience with previous cases of infective dermatitis indicates the possibility of such progression.\r"

A cardinal feature is the massing of red cells containing mature Plasmodium falciparum within the cerebral capillaries. Adhesion of these parasitised red cells to endothelium, an event which may initiate cerebral malaria, is being studied at the molecular level. However, the relevance of these studies to the pathophysiology and treatment of human cerebral malaria is uncertain. Although chloroquine is still widely used to treat falciparum malaria, resistance has spread to most of the endemic zone. Quinine is emerging as the only effective treatment for cerebral malaria, though resistance to this drug threatens to become a problem. Alternative drugs are urgently needed.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, we have seen increasing use of partial laryngectomies for larger lesions that were previously treated by total laryngectomy. The resultant closer margins have made postoperative radiation therapy an important adjuvant treatment to conservation laryngeal surgery. We review the University of California, Los Angeles, experience with combination partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy between 1973 and 1987 for treatment of carcinoma of the larynx. Twenty-four such patients who underwent partial laryngectomies and postoperative radiation therapy are examined. Techniques of treatment, complications, and the functional ability of the remaining larynx are discussed. The locoregional control rate at 5 years was 80%. Risk factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence were positive margins, vascular invasion, and extranodal spread. There were no major problems with postoperative wound healing or airway management during the radiation treatment. Vocal and swallowing function were well preserved in most cases. We conclude that combination partial laryngectomy and radiation therapy permits preservation of laryngeal function without serious complications, and therefore is an effective treatment for selected patients with carcinoma of the larynx.\r"

Abnormalities consisting mainly of prolonged interpeak latencies were detected in one third of these patients. It is speculated that the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for these auditory brainstem-evoked abnormalities are stretching-compression of the cochlear nerve and brainstem caused by the intracranial hypertension and/or primary edema of the same structures due to the benign intracranial hypertension syndrome itself. Normalization or improvement was noticed in the majority of the patients after management. Since the number of patients in this study is small, it is felt that the diagnostic and prognostic value of this test needs further evaluation.\r"

Angioedema is a rare, but potentially lethal adverse effect when associated with upper airway obstruction. Four cases of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema, three with significant upper airway obstruction, are reported. Angioedema secondary to ACE inhibition appears to be mechanism based. The probable link is the potentiation of bradykinin, which results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and angioedema. Since angioedema can progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists must be aware of this association. The differential diagnosis and treatment of this adverse effect is discussed, as well as a review of ACE inhibitors and other causes of angioedema.\r"

The incidence of recurrent or persistent disease ranged from 13% for Stage II to 30% for Stage IV. Stage I and III patients had 13% and 18% recurrence rates, respectively. Computed tomography staging is shown to be useful in outlining operative strategies and is a reliable prognosticator of the disease process.\r"

  ".U": "91041471\r", 
  ".W": "Surgical control of severe epistaxis is usually reserved for cases refractory to more conservative techniques. We present our experience with intraoral ligation of the maxillary artery as it courses through the buccal fat pad before it enters the pterygopalatine fossa and branches posterior to the maxilla. This technique has been found useful in the control of nasal hemorrhage as well as an adjunct to other surgical procedures, such as removal of benign and malignant neoplasms involving the maxilla and paranasal sinuses. This technique was used for ligation of the maxillary artery in 20 patients. The artery was readily identified in some cases, but required more extensive dissection in others; therefore, an anatomic study in 18 preserved and fresh cadaver specimens was undertaken to investigate the variability of the maxillary artery in the region of the buccal fat pad. There appeared to be significant variation in the distance from the buccal mucosal incision site, as well as variation in the relationship to the pterygoid muscles. This relationship to the pterygoids explains the occasional difficulty in locating the artery for ligation. This technique represents a reasonable alternative to the more traditional transantral approach to ligation of the maxillary artery, as long as the surgeon understands the anatomy of the region, its variations, and where the artery may be located if not immediately apparent. No major complications have been experienced.\r"

  ".W": "As the identification of patients with small acoustic neuromas and salvageable hearing increases, intraoperative auditory nerve monitoring has been used increasingly in an attempt to improve the hearing preservation rate. Far-field recordings obtained by brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), at times enhanced by electrocochleography, have become a standard method of intraoperative auditory nerve assessment. To evaluate the usefulness of this monitoring technique, the hearing preservation results of a series of unmonitored acoustic tumor removals were compared to a series of patients monitored via the standard brainstem auditory evoked potentials. With comparable average tumor sizes, 4 of 7 unmonitored patients had hearing preserved at preoperative levels compared to 4 of 9 monitored patients. Neither preoperative BAEP assessments nor absolute tumor size were predictive of hearing preservation. This report brings into question the effectiveness of far-field intraoperative BAEP monitoring during acoustic tumor resection and suggests that direct auditory nerve monitoring may be more appropriate.\r"

Intensity-response functions were obtained in the unparalyzed condition, then repeated after infusion of a neuromuscular paralyzing agent. In both cases, the myogenic response was observed at lower stimulus intensities than the EABR components. As intensity increased, the myogenic responses grew at extremely rapid rates and made any subsequent identification of auditory responses virtually impossible. To alleviate the adverse influence of myogenic components, general anesthesia and a paralyzing agent must be incorporated into the test protocol when acquiring the EABR using a promontory site of stimulation.\r"

On January 1, 1987, we began a 3-year prospective study to delineate potential etiologic factors involved in the development of subglottic stenosis in neonates. The present study analyzes data from 289 infants. Relationships between birth weight, gestational age, endotracheal tube size, duration of intubation and ventilation, number and difficulty of intubations, and the subsequent need for medical and surgical therapy are discussed. Whole organ larynges from autopsy specimens provide histological correlation.\r"

In 42 dissections, no radicality could be obtained. Of the 523 histologically radical dissections, examination revealed tumor in 352 cases. Patients in whom three or more positive nodes or extranodal spread in one or more nodes were found received postoperative radiotherapy. In the histologically N0 group, the incidence of neck recurrence after 5 years was 3%; in the N+ group as a whole, it was 10%. Analysis of the influence of extranodal spread and the number of positive nodes showed that the group with one or two positive nodes without extranodal spread (that did not receive postoperative radiotherapy) did not statistically differ from the other groups. This suggests that the results of the group with one or two positive nodes without extranodal spread can be improved by postoperative radiotherapy.\r"

Priorities for further development of the methods and instruments for prosthetic voice rehabilitation have led to the design of a low-resistance, self-retaining voice prosthesis (Provox) and an adapted replacement method. The results obtained in 79 patients are described. In vivo airflow resistance ranged from 1.0 to 3.8 kPa (mean = 1.9 kPa). Speech quality was good in 91% of the patients. The self-retaining properties of the prosthesis appeared to be satisfactory. The average device-life was more than 5 months. Replacement of the prosthesis with a new disposable guide wire was done quickly as an outpatient procedure. Maintenance of the prosthesis by the patient was simple. The new low-resistance, self-retaining Provox voice prosthesis and the modified replacement method appeared to further improve the results of prosthetic voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy.\r"

We report the results of the treatment of two patients with severely obstructing intraluminal tracheal metastatic melanoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma, using the neodymium-YAG laser via the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. Both patients complained of significant dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, and hemoptysis and were not candidates for rigid bronchoscopy because of underlying medical contraindications and anatomical problems. Multiple treatment sessions were used with treatment intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. All treatments were performed in the operating room under sedation, without intubation, with topical lidocaine and standard superior laryngeal nerve block. Successful relief of airway obstruction with complete regression of the endotracheal masses was achieved and no recurrences were seen after 9 months' follow-up. Flexible Nd:YAG laser bronchoscopy offered an alternative for the relief of obstructing endotracheal or bronchial malignancies in patients in whom the rigid bronchoscope could not be passed. it seemed to prolong survival in selected cases, and provided definite improvement in quality of life.\r"

Modifications of the original circuit in a cervical muscle model has added fine tuning to basic \"all-or-none\" pacing. Rehabilitation of phonation illustrated the sophisticated nature of voice and the need for restoration of fine tuning. Five mongrel dogs received nerve-muscle pedicles into the thyroarytenoideus, cricothyroideus, and posterior cricothyroideus after denervation of one hemilarynx. Following appropriate reinnervation time, pedicles and intact recurrent laryngeal nerves were injected with currents of variable amplitudes and pulse widths to achieve graded vocal fold control while air was blown intratracheally towards the glottic chink. Videoscopic and spectral analyses indicated that artificial phonation could be restored to frequencies measured in the normal state. These experiments suggested that rehabilitation of the impaired voice by servocontrol might eventually be feasible.\r"

The CO2 broncholaser appears to be a technique of choice in this age group, in which the narrowness of the airways makes any endoscopic procedure difficult.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of pulsed holmium:YAG laser (2.1 microns wavelength) for this application. Fresh normal tissue (n = 139) and arteriosclerotic canine arteries (n = 21) as well as formalin-preserved normal canine (n = 31) and atherosclerotic human arteries (n = 177) were irradiated under saline via a 600 microns diameter fiber placed perpendicular to the intimal surface with 0-10 gm of force. The laser was operated in the free running mode (FRM; 250 microseconds pulsewidth, 5 Hz, 30-7,100 mJ/mm2) and in the Q-switched mode (QSM; 200 nsec pulsewidth, 6 Hz, 30-1,100 mJ/mm2). Following the experiments, the samples were prepared for histologic and morphometric analysis. Ablation thresholds in the FRM were 60 and 180 mJ/mm2 in fresh and preserved canine tissue, respectively. Ablation thresholds in the QSM for fresh and preserved canine tissues were 75 and 180 mJ/mm2, respectively. Thresholds for human atherosclerotic tissue were dependent on the amount of calcification. In the QSM and FRM, there were no samples that could not be penetrated at 1,100 mJ/mm2 and above. Histologic examination of the FRM samples revealed confined columns of tissue ablation, with approximately 55-250 microns and 70-140 microns zones of thermal effect being apparent in the fresh and formalin-preserved samples, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A comparison was made between the XeCl laser cut rate data obtained using the 35-ns duration laser pulses to data obtained using 200-ns duration pulses for each of the four plaque types. As the degree of tissue calcification increased higher XeCl laser fluences were required for the long pulse case to achieve the same cut depth per pulse as that observed using the shorter pulse duration.\r"

We studied the effect of 50-400 degrees C tip temperatures on depth of ablation at 192 sites on plaqued and normal human aorta in vitro, and the angiographic and histologic response in vivo of 300-400 degrees C at probe/vessel ratios of 0.5-1.0, in 40 normal canine femoral artery segments. In vitro, there was a direct relationship between tip temperature and depth of ablation, r = 0.71 (all segments), r = 0.74 for fibrous plaque, but a poor correlation in fatty plaque r = 0.35. In fibrous plaque, there was proportionately more ablation at tip temperatures greater than 300 degrees C, mean depth 0.62 mm, than at 150-300 degrees C, mean 0.37 mm, (P less than .001). Ablation was similar in plaqued and normal aorta. In vivo, 300 degrees C, 350 degrees C, and 400 degrees C produced similar effects. At probe/vessel ratios less than 0.8, only disruption of internal elastic lamina was observed. At ratios greater than or equal to 0.8, spasm occurred in 39% (7/18), transmural damage in 28% (5/18), and perforation in one of 18. Ablation is not selective for plaque and is highly variable in fatty plaque. Tip temperatures above 300 degrees C produce greater ablation than at lower temperatures. In clinical applications, probe/vessel rations less than or equal to 0.7 may be most appropriate, and it appears that thermal remodeling may contribute more to outcome than plaque ablation.\r"

Six dogs underwent vasectomy, followed by vasovasostomies performed between 4 and 12 weeks later, utilizing two approximating sutures and welding with the carbon dioxide milliwatt laser. Metal clips were used both for x-ray analysis and localization of the vasovasostomy site. All dogs had pre-vasectomy semen analysis. Following vasectomy each dog underwent ejaculation until azoospermia was obtained. Vasovasostomy was performed and semen was examined. Prior to harvesting, vasography was also obtained. All ejaculates had active sperm noted and 12 of 12 vasograms (100%) revealed patency. The dogs were sacrificed at 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks post-vasovasostomy. The vasovasostomy specimens were studied with electron microscopy and by histological evaluation. The vasovasostomy was completed in under 90 minutes by using this laser-assisted technique. This procedure offers to the urologist a more simplified and reproducible operation that can be performed easily and with a potential decrease in hospital costs.\r"

The CO2 laser possesses ideal tissue characteristics. Recent advances in optical engineering and pulsing the energy have increased the precision of this laser to now provide the accuracy required for delicate microsurgery. Two clinical studies analyze the long-term hearing results and complications in patients who had undergone CO2 laser stapedectomy revision (59 patients) and CO2 laser stapedotomy (153 patients).

The laser initiator was applied to a cleaned enamel surface and irradiated at an energy output of 30 mJ or 75 mJ. Both energy levels produced morphologic changes of the surface. There was a sharp line of demarcation between the coated, irradiated area and the surrounding noncoated enamel surface. The scanning electron microscope view at the lower energy level showed that the surface had melted and reformed with numerous small, bubble-like inclusions. The 75 mJ energy level showed individual impact craters with shallow centers and raised edges containing numerous pores and large, bubble-like inclusions. Etching is a dental procedure in which an acid is normally used to remove a thin outer layer of the tooth structure. This is necessary to create a roughened, irregular surface in order to provide mechanical retention for dental restorative materials. The changes produced by the laser in this study suggest a simple, effective, and controlled method of etching the enamel surface of a tooth by altering its surface characteristics.\r"

At 3 days, the wounded stromal areas showed some degree of haze. Haze was progressively reduced over 1 month, but it could be still discerned biomicroscopically. A hemicircular opacification corresponding to the flap edges was also apparent on slit-lamp examination. Microscopic observation showed that the epithelium was normal, except at the flap margins, where it was thickened. An increased number of keratocytes was observed in the interface between the flap stroma and the ablated area. The procedure might induce stable corneal changes because of the preservation of the anterior layers of the cornea.\r"

It uses a liposome-encapsulated fluorescent dye that is released by application of laser energy in a specific retinal vessel. The method is shown to be able to distinguish between peak systolic velocity and minimum diastolic velocity. In the cynomolgus monkey, the two values were found to differ by approximately a factor of three. It is known that many ocular and systemic diseases affect retinal circulation, and therefore a method of blood velocity measurement with such sensitivity may prove highly valuable in the practice of ophthalmology. As an example, the velocity in a retinal vein was measured before and after partial occlusion by photocoagulation. The two values obtained were significantly different, and the blood velocity was found to return to the value prior to occlusion when measured at 18 days.\r"

In this study, the efficiency of pulsed CO2 laser ablation of burned and normal swine skin was studied in vitro with a mass loss technique. The heats of ablation for normal and burned skin were 2,706 and 2,416 J/cm3 of tissue ablated, respectively. The mean threshold radiant exposures for ablating normal skin and eschar were 2.6 J/cm2 and 3.0 J/cm2, respectively. Radiant exposures greater than 19 J/cm2 produced a plasma, which decreased the efficiency of laser ablation. Thus the radiant exposures for efficient ablation range from 4 to 19 J/cm2, and within this radiant exposure range 20-40 microns of tissue are ablated per pulse. We also examined, on a gross and histopathologic basis, in vivo burn eschar excision with a pulsed CO2 laser. The laser allowed bloodless excisions of full thickness burns on the backs of male hairless rats. The zone of thermal damage was approximately 85 microns over the subjacent fascia. The pulsed CO2 laser can ablate burn eschar efficiently, precisely, and bloodlessly and may prove valuable for the excision of burned and necrotic tissue.\r"

Forearm BMC was measured using single photon absorptiometry at proximal (shaft) and distal sites on the radius. Dual photon absorptiometry was used to measure BMC at the lumbar vertebrae (L2-4) and femur at the femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and greater trochanter. Fat-free body mass (FFBM) was estimated from densitometry. Body builders had greater BMC than swimmers, collegiate runners, recreational runners, and controls. Mean differences in BMC among runners, swimmers, and controls were not significant (P less than or equal to 0.05). FFBM was correlated significantly with BMC (r = 0.35-0.56) at each site in the combined group of athletes (N = 39), whereas total body weight and BMC were correlated significantly at the distal radius site (r = 0.38) only. The results suggest that weight training may provide a better stimulus for increasing BMC than run and swim training.\r"

We studied 12 Caucasian intercollegiate volleyball players (V), nine basketball players (B), ten swimmers (S), and 13 non-athletes (N) with bone density measurements by photon absorptiometry of their calcaneus and lumbar spine (L2-L4). The effect of athletic status on bone density was analyzed by multivariate analysis of covariance, with height and weight as covariates. The bone densities reported below are mean +/- SE, adjusted for the covariates; units = g.cm-2, P less than 0.005. The swimmers had a significantly lower mean density in the lumbar spine than all other groups; the non-athletes' mean density was also lower than that of volleyball players (V = 1.31 +/- 0.03, B = 1.26 +/- 0.04, N = 1.18 +/- 0.03, S = 1.05 +/- 0.03). The volleyball and basketball players' mean calcaneal densities were greater than those of the swimmers and non-athletes (V = 0.530 +/- 0.017, B = 0.564 +/- 0.023, N = 0.438 +/- 0.018, S = 0.375 +/- 0.019). The higher bone densities for athletes in vertical weight-bearing activities are consistent with some but not all published data. The swimmers' low bone density in the lumbar spine, less than published values for amenorrheic runners, was unexpected.\r"

Thus, the purpose of this study was to measure selected physiological and metabolic responses to maximal and submaximal exercise during two phases of the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic runners and amenorrheic runners. Eight eumenorrheic runners (29.0 +/- 4.2 yr) and eight amenorrheic runners (24.5 +/- 5.7 yr) matched for physical, gynecological, and training characteristics were studied. The eumenorrheic runners performed one maximal and one submaximal (40 min at 80% VO2max) treadmill run during both the early follicular (days 2-4) and midluteal (6-8 d from LH surge) phases. The amenorrheic runners performed one maximal and one submaximal (40 min at 80% VO2max) treadmill run. Cycle phases were documented by urinary luteinizing hormone and progesterone assays and by plasma estradiol and progesterone assays. No differences were observed in oxygen uptake, minute ventilation, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, rating of perceived exertion, time to fatigue (maximal), and plasma lactate (following the maximal and submaximal exercise tests) between the follicular and luteal phases in the eumenorrheic runners and the amenorrheic runners. We conclude that neither menstrual phase (follicular vs luteal) nor menstrual status (eumenorrheic vs amenorrheic) alters or limits exercise performance in female athletes.\r"

Immediately following the race, PV, creatinine clearance, and urine flow were unchanged from pre-race values. Over the subsequent 3 d, PV increased due initially to a 17 g influx of serum albumin and an associated increase in plasma sodium content, which persisted throughout the study period. A reduction in urine sodium secretion occurred during the race day. Creatinine clearance increased after the race and remained elevated for 48 h. Increases serum enzyme activities, C-reactive protein concentration, serum uric acid content, and plasma creatinine concentration and production suggest muscle damage. We suggested the following. First, the persistent post-exercise plasma volume expansion is initiated by an influx of albumin into the intravascular space with an associated increase in plasma sodium content. A decrease in urine sodium excretion during the race day would contribute to the latter. Second, the interpretation of post-race changes in serum constituents must take account of changes in plasma volume. Third, there is an increase in creatinine clearance, indicating an increase in glomerular filtration rate, after both standard and ultramarathon running. This may be caused by the products of muscle cell damage although the physiologic mechanism for this is unclear.\r"

Whole blood was analyzed for hematocrit and hemoglobin to determine plasma volume shifts. Plasma aliquots were assayed for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride concentrations, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was estimated. Total cholesterol concentrations were significantly reduced 1 d following the exercise and were still lower 3 and 5 d post-marathon. LDL-C was lower immediately and 1 d after the marathon. HDL-C concentrations, corrected for changes in plasma volume, were elevated 24 h post-exercise. The ratio of HDL/total cholesterol was increased 24 h post-exercise. Triglyceride concentrations were elevated immediately following the marathon but returned to baseline levels by 24 h post-exercise. These results demonstrate that prolonged strenuous exercise in women produces changes in blood lipid profiles that can last for several days.\r"

In a crossover design, seven male subjects performed two 3-d trials of either running (trial R) or cycling (trial C) for 60 min at 75% VO2max. Biopsy samples were obtained before and after each day's exercise from the gastrocnemius (trial R) or vastus lateralis (trial C) muscle. Diets in the 2 d preceding and during each trial contained 5 g carbohydrate.kg-1.d-1 and 14,475 +/- 402 kJ.d-1. Mean pre-exercise glycogen content (mmol.kg-1 wet wt.) was significantly reduced in both trials on day 3 (103.4 +/- 6.0) when compared to day 1 and day 2 (119.9 +/- 6.8 and 116.4 +/- 5.7, respectively). Day 1 glycogen reduction was significantly greater in trial C (P less than 0.03), and glycogen restorage was greater (P less than 0.02) only in trial C between the 1st and 2nd d. On day 3, spectrophotometric analysis of PAS strains showed that pre-exercise glycogen content in either muscle group was significantly (P less than 0.01) less in Type I as compared to Type II fibers. This difference in fiber glycogen storage did not appear to be attributable to muscle damage as negligible leukocyte infiltration and low blood CK levels were obtained. No difference between modes were observed for CK values throughout the trials. These data suggest that the depressed glycogen storage before the 3rd d of exercise was due to the moderate carbohydrate intake.\r"

Subjects (N = 18) were measured prior to the start of the season (PRE), twice in the midseason, and once during late season (LATE) for weight, percent body fat, and height. At each of these times, a venous blood sample was obtained from the subjects, who were fasted, and analyzed for concentrations of albumin, prealbumin, retinol binding protein (RBP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin, hematocrit, and 23 amino acids. Diet records were kept by subjects to assess daily energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Results showed that wrestlers decreased weight by an average of 6.6 +/- 0.9% and that percent body fat, fat-free weight, plasma levels of prealbumin and RBP, the ratio of total essential amino acids to total amino acids, and dietary energy nutrient intakes were significantly lower at LATE compared to PRE. RBP decreased during midseason and averaged (+/- SE) 3.21 +/- 0.15 mg.100 ml-1 at LATE; prealbumin was significantly lower at LATE with a mean value of 19.8 +/- 1.0 mg.100 ml-1. Total energy intake decreased from PRE values by 35%, to approximately 27 kcal.kg-1.d-1 during the season. In conclusion, in these high school wrestlers who lost approximately 6.6% of weight, there were adverse effects on some of the indices of protein nutritional status.\r"

  ".W": "Possible changes in muscle size and function due to resistance training were examined in prepubertal boys. Thirteen boys (9-11 yr) volunteered for each of the training and control groups. Progressive resistance training was performed three times weekly for 20 wk. Measurements consisted of the following: 1 repetition maximum (RM) bench press and leg press; maximal voluntary isometric and isokinetic elbow flexion and knee extension strength; evoked isometric contractile properties of the right elbow flexors and knee extensors; muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) by computerized tomography at the mid-right upper arm and thigh; and motor unit activation (MUA) by the interpolated twitch procedure. Training significantly increased 1 RM bench press (35%) and leg press (22%), isometric elbow flexion (37%) and knee extension strength (25% and 13% at 90 degrees and 120 degrees, respectively), isokinetic elbow flexion (26%) and knee extension (21%) strength, and evoked twitch torque of the elbow flexors (30%) and knee extensors (30%). There were no significant effects of training on the time-related contractile properties (time to peak torque, half-relaxation time), CSA, or %MUA of the elbow flexors or knee extensors. There was, however, a trend toward increased MUA for the elbow flexors and knee extensors in the trained group. Strength gains were independent of changes in muscle CSA, and the increases in twitch torque suggest possible adaptations in muscle excitation-contraction coupling. Improved motor skill coordination (especially during the early phase of training), a tendency toward increased MUA, and other undetermined neurological adaptations, including better coordination of the involved muscle groups, are likely the major determinants of the strength gains in this study.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether shorter-duration, moderate-intensity exercise would also result in HA. Nine trained runners performed two 9-d exercise heat-stress protocols. Each protocol consisted of a 90-min heat tolerance test on days 1 (HTT1) and 9 (HTT2). On days 2-8 the subjects exercised at 50% VO2max for 60 min.d-1 (T50) or at 75% VO2max for 30-35 min.d-1 (T75). Final HTT2 heart rate and rectal temperature (Tr) were significantly (P less than 0.001) reduced, as compared to HTT1, with no differences between T50 and T75. Both protocols resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) reductions in HTT2 pre-exercise Tr and total exercising caloric expenditure, both of which are known to contribute to HA. No changes in resting plasma volume, osmolality, protein, post-HTT aldosterone, and exercising sweat rate were observed. These results demonstrate that equal levels of HA were obtained with T50 and T75, which suggests that moderate-intensity, short-duration exercise in the heat can produce HA in trained subjects.\r"

General physiological responses were similar for each drink during 2 h of multi-modal exercise in the heat; however, blood glucose, carbohydrate utilization, and exercise intensity at the end of a ST may be increased with CE fluid replacement.\r"

Metabolic rate during exercise was 221 W for WD and 255 W for AB (P greater than 0.05). Oral temperature (Tor), mean skin temperature (Tsk), oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (Qc) were assessed periodically throughout the exercise period. Ambient conditions were 24-25 degrees C and 38-52% relative humidity. A significant group X time interaction was found for Tor (P less than 0.001) and Tsk (P less than 0.001). Tor of the WD group steadily increased during the exercise, whereas the AB group showed a stable Tor. Tsk of WD increased rapidly during the first 5-10 min of exercise and continued to rise at a slower rate throughout the exercise. In contrast, Tsk of AB rose to a peak during the first 10 min and then showed a decreasing trend. VO2 and HR remained stable in both groups throughout the exercise period. Following an initial increase in Qc from minute 10 to minute 20 in both groups, values for WD continually decreased until Qc at 80 min was 14% lower than at 10 min. The findings suggest that the WD women had greater thermoregulatory strain than the AB women as indicated by a higher Tor and Tsk and by an inability to maintain Qc due to paralysis of the lower limbs and perhaps an increase in cutaneous blood volume.\r"

Temperature and activity were measured by biotelemetry. Hamsters ran 6-7 km per night (12:12 L:D) when permitted access to wheels. No running occurred during the light periods. During the 3rd wk of running, temperatures of exercising hamsters were significantly elevated by 0.5 degree C (P less than 0.001) during the dark period and by 0.3 degree C (P less than 0.003) during the light period compared with sedentary hamsters. Cessation of running removed the difference between groups, and resumption of running restored it. Both the injection of endotoxin and the psychological stress of cage switch resulted in similar peak temperatures in exercising and sedentary hamsters despite higher pre-treatment temperatures in the exercise group. We interpret these results to support the hypothesis that regular exercise may cause an upward resetting of the set-point for body temperature.\r"

In a 12-h period, the 12 groups of children spent, on the average, 7-10 h at less than 30% VO2max, 1.5-4 h at 30-50% VO2max, and an accumulated time of 20-60 min above 50% VO2max. The latter occurred in short bursts rather than during sustained periods. There was a statistically significant but small decrease (approximately -3%) in the average 12 h %VO2max with age but no effects of sex or nutritional status. The overall average was about 25% VO2max in all groups. The data may suggest the existence of the regulation of physical activity to some level easily sustainable for long periods. Expressing the data as 30 min averages during 5 h of school and 5 h of free-time activity allows for the possibility of seeing group differences during shorter periods of time. This may prove useful in exercise training programs and studies of effort in the workplace.\r"

The validity of cross-modal prescription of exercise intensity based on rated perceived exertion (RPE) was determined for eight men (26 +/- SE 1.9 yr) at absolute and relative VO2. Exercise modes were treadmill (TM), cycle ergometer (C), and bench stepping while pumping 0.91 kg handweights (HB). Relative (Rel) constant load sessions were performed for each mode at 70% of mode-specific VO2 peak. Absolute (Absol) constant load sessions were performed for C and HB at the VO2 equivalent to 70% of TM VO2 peak. The five 12 min sessions were presented on separate days in random order. RPE-Overall during TM-Rel (11.1) was a) lower (P less than 0.05) than C-Absol (12.6) and HB-Absol (12.5) and b) the same as C-Rel (11.3) and HB-Rel (10.7). RPE-Legs during TM-Rel was a) lower (P less than 0.05) than C-Absol and HB-Absol and b) the same as C-Rel and HB-Rel. RPE-Chest a) did not differ between TM-Rel and C-Absol or HB-Absol and b) was lower (P less than 0.05) for C-Rel and HB-Rel than TM-Rel. RPE-Arms was higher (P less than 0.05) for C-Absol, HB-Absol, and HB-Rel than TM-Rel but did not differ between TM-Rel and C-Rel. Oxygen uptake, heart rate, and ventilation during TM-Rel were a) the same as C-Absol and HB-Absol and b) higher (P less than 0.05) than C-Rel and HB-Rel. Perceptually based cross-modal prescription of exercise intensity using a psychophysical estimation method is valid provided that the physiological reference is the relative, not the absolute, VO2.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare for a group of ten subjects the mechanical output about the ankle during isokinetic plantar flexion with that during one-legged vertical jumps. For evaluation of the mechanical output the plantar flexion moment of force was related to the angular velocity of plantar flexion. The relationship for isokinetic plantar flexion was obtained using an isokinetic dynamometer; that for plantar flexion in jumping was obtained by combining kinematics and ground reaction forces. It was found that, at any given angular velocity of plantar flexion above 1 rad.s-1, the subjects produced much larger moments during jumping than during isokinetic plantar flexion. In order to explain the observed differences in mechanical output about the ankle, a model was used to simulate isokinetic plantar flexion and plantar flexion during jumping. The model represented both m. soleus and m. gastrocnemius as a complex composed of elastic tissue in series with muscle fibers. The force of the muscle fibers depended on fiber length, shortening velocity (Vfibers), and active state. The input variables of the model were histories of shortening velocities of the complexes, determined from kinematics, and active state. Among the output variables were Vfibers and plantar flexion moment. The simulation results were very similar to the experimental findings. According to the simulation results there are two reasons why at the same angular velocity of plantar flexion larger moments were produced during jumping than during isokinetic plantar flexion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For DR, a force platform was mounted on a sloped concrete block flush with the surface of a ramp. A two-dimensional link segment model was used to calculate net stance phase moments for the knee and ankle. Data were averaged over all subjects for each condition. There was no significant difference (P less than 0.05) between DR and LR for peak flexion velocity, peak extensor moment, or peak power absorption at the knee. Negative work done on the extensor muscles of the knee during stance was significantly greater for DR (58.0 +/- 13 J) than for LR (30.0 +/- 9.0 J). Peak ankle power absorption was significantly greater for DR (619 +/- 85 W) than for LR (396 +/- 180 W). The negative work done on the extensor muscles of the ankle during stance was significantly greater for DR (26.1 +/- 3.2 J) than for LR (12.6 +/- 6.6 J). The results suggest that muscle soreness during DR may be related to high peak power absorption values since the peak joint extensor moments are similar between conditions.\r"

In Study 1, 35 children (20 boys, 15 girls, mean age = 10.8 yr) wore the accelerometer and a heart rate (HR) monitor for 2 d. Caltrac activity counts per hour were compared to the mean \"activity HR\", which was calculated by subtracting the mean of the five lowest HRs of the day from each recorded HR. Pearson r's between accelerometer and activity HR were 0.54 (P less than 0.001) on day 1 and 0.42 (P less than 0.02) on day 2. Inter-instrument reliability in the field was r = 0.96. Both accelerometer and HR data were significantly correlated with physical activity recalls of the same day. In Study 2, 15 children walked/ran for 10 min at 3, 4, and 5 mph on a horizontal treadmill while wearing two accelerometers. Oxygen uptake was directly measured each minute. Reliability of the Caltracs in the laboratory was 0.89. Activity count correlated r = 0.82 (SEE = 23%) with net calorie cost per kg of body weight. Net caloric expenditure per kg of weight was 0.101 kcal.kg-1.d-1 per Caltrac activity count. These data support the use of the Caltrac accelerometer as a physical activity measure for school-age children, and the objective data tended to corroborate the children's short-term activity recalls.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous equations exist for predicting VO2max from the duration (an analog of maximal work rate, Wmax) of a treadmill graded exercise test (GXT). Since a similar equation for cycle ergometry (CE) was not available, we saw the need to develop such an equation, hypothesizing that CE VO2max could be accurately predicted due to its more direct relationship with W. Thus, healthy, sedentary males (N = 115) and females (N = 116), aged 20-70 yr, were given a 15 W.min-1 CE GXT. The following multiple linear regression equations which predict VO2max (ml.min-1) from the independent variables of Wmax (W), body weight (kg), and age (yr) were derived from our subjects: Males: Y = 10.51 (W) + 6.35 (kg) - 10.49 (yr) + 519.3 ml.min-1; R = 0.939, SEE = 212 ml.min-1. Females: Y = 9.39 (W) + 7.7 (kg) - 5.88 (yr) + 136.7 ml.min-1; R = 0.932, SEE = 147 ml.min-1 Using the 95% confidence limits as examples of worst case errors, our equations predict VO2max to within 10% of its true value. Internal (double cross-validation) and external cross-validation analyses yielded r values ranging between 0.920 and 0.950 for the male and female regression equations. These results indicate that use of the equations generated in this study for a 15 W.min-1 CE GXT provides accurate estimates of VO2max.\r"

In the reproducibility phase of the study, 20 subjects were tested in two trials each of eight tests, yielding 20 separate test values per trial, accounting for each angle of flexion and plane of force tested. Both legs were tested, providing an N of 40. Test-retest correlations of the two trials and dependent t-tests indicated that the Genucom provided generally stable and reproducible results. In the normal value database phase of the study, 218 different subjects were given one trial of the same eight tests. Testing of both legs provided an N greater than 400.

Velocity time courses of a generalized speed skater were calculated for all Olympic distances (500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 5000 m, and 10,000 m) by means of simulation of an equation of produced power, power dissipated to air and ice friction, and rate of change of kinetic energy of the skater. Different strategies of distribution of anaerobic energy during a race were compared. With a single equation it appeared to be possible to simulate the mean split and final times of the five distances realized during the Winter Olympics 1988 within an error which does not exceed 1.6% (mean error in final times: 0.8%). The results show that a fast acceleration (high initial power output) is crucial for the sprinting events (500 m and 1000 m). It is shown that this initial power output level is even more important than the total amount of energy available for a 500 m and 1000 m race. For the long distances the simulations show that skaters should combine a fast but short lasting start with a constant power output following the start in order to minimize air frictional losses.\r"

  ".W": "Twelve male cadavers (aged 50-94 yr) were subjected to comprehensive anthropometry, dissection, and weighing of all skeletal muscle. Correlation coefficients of limb girths with total skeletal muscle mass (MM) were high: forearm r = 0.96, mid-thigh r = 0.94, calf r = 0.84, and midarm r = 0.82. These increased when limb girths were corrected (by subtracting pi times the skinfold thickness) to estimate muscle girth. For dimensional consistency, variables in the regression analyses included the product of stature and the square of each corrected girth. For the six unembalmed cadavers, this yielded a three-girth equation for MM (r2 = 0.93; SEE = 1.56 kg), which was then validated using data from the embalmed cadavers. It predicted MM with an SEE of 1.58 kg and r2 = 0.93. Because the values of these SEEs were similar, we pooled the subjects from the two groups to generate the final estimation equation: MM = STAT (0.0553CTG2 + 0.0987FG2 + 0.0331CCG2) - 2445 (SEE = 1.53 kg, r2 = 0.97), where STAT is stature (cm), CTG is thigh circumference corrected for the front thigh skinfold thickness (cm), FG is the uncorrected forearm circumference (cm), and CCG is the calf circumference corrected for the medial calf skinfold thickness (cm). Despite the limitations of the cadaver sample, the proposed equation appears to provide the best estimate of skeletal muscle mass to date, in that it is the only cadaver-validated equation and it gives values that are consistent with all known dissection data.\r"

The principal presenting symptoms are malaise, fever, and weight loss, although a wide variety of complaints are documented. Pulmonary involvement is uncommon. The granulomata are noncaseating with a few multinucleate giant cells and some surrounding chronic inflammatory infiltrate. There is no evidence of an associated arteritis. The disease has a relapsing and remitting course and although it may require treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, particularly if the kidneys are involved, the prognosis is relatively good. We propose that this entity be called granulomatous syndrome of unknown origin. The characteristics that set this syndrome apart from the other granulomatous vasculitides are discussed. The current limited understanding of granuloma formation does not allow us to propose a definite etiology for this condition. It is emphasized that it is not helpful to encompass it within a label of sarcoidosis. First, it may only serve to confuse the doctor in assessing and treating this very particular group of patients. Secondly, it may hinder future attempts to understand the different pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the various conditions in which granulomata may arise.\r"

Its presentation is often confusing because of the paucity of clues suggestive of pancreatic disease and the preponderance of pulmonary symptoms and signs. Most patients are alcoholics but only one-half will have a clinical history of previous pancreatitis. Pleural effusions are large, recurrent, and highly exudative in nature. Many patients go through extensive pulmonary evaluation before the pancreas is identified as the site of primary pathology. An elevated serum amylase may be the first clue to the diagnosis. However, the key to the diagnosis is a dramatically elevated pleural fluid amylase. Effusions in association with acute pancreatitis, esophageal perforation, and thoracic malignancy are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of an elevated pleural fluid amylase but are usually easy to exclude. Computed tomography is excellent in defining pancreatic abnormalities and should be the first abdominal imaging study in suspected cases. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is used as a diagnostic tool only in confusing cases. Although no systematic study evaluates medical versus surgical therapy, we recommend an initial 2 to 4-week trial of medical therapy, including allowance of no oral intake, total parenteral nutrition, chest tube thoracostomy, and possibly a regimen of somatostatin or its analogs. The major complication in these patients is superinfection, which results in significant morbidity and mortality. Failure of medical therapy should be considered failure of pleural effusion(s) to clear, recurrence after reinstatement of oral intake, or superinfection. For those patients who fail to benefit from medical therapy, surgery is indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two cases of PCL were reviewed, in which 9 patients had AIDS and 13 did not. A review of the literature identified 247 cases of AIDS-related PCL. Differences between patients with AIDS and immunocompetent PCL were noted in our series. AIDS-related PCL when compared to non-AIDS PCL in our series has the following notable clinical features: 1) significantly younger age at presentation, median age 34 versus 59 years; 2) significantly higher incidence of B symptoms, 44% versus 8%; 3) worse median performance status at presentation, 3 versus 1; and, 4) shorter median survival, 3 versus 10 months. Differences in performance status and survival, however, were not significant. AIDS-related PCL is further characterized by frequent (44%) ring-enhancing mass lesions on head CT scan, a finding that makes it clinically difficult to distinguish from toxoplasmosis. Median survival appears to be improved in the absence of opportunistic infection at time of diagnosis of PCL, 6 versus 2 months. The therapeutic approach to patients with PCL, with and without AIDS, is variable. Combined modality therapy may improve the survival in patients with non-AIDS PCL. Therapy for patients with AIDS-related PCL is tailored to the status of the individual and it is, therefore, difficult to make comparisons to non-AIDS PCL patients. AIDS patients are often too ill to tolerate aggressive surgery or systemic treatment and in this instance, radiotherapy alone may be an acceptable alternative. Nonetheless, overall survival for patients with AIDS-related and non-AIDS PCL remains poor.\r"

  ".W": "Histoplasmosis is a serious opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, often representing the first manifestation of the syndrome. Most infections occurring within the endemic region are caused by exogenous exposure, while those occurring in nonendemic areas may represent endogenous reactivation of latent foci of infection or exogenous exposure to microfoci located within those nonendemic regions. However, prospective investigations are needed to prove the mode of acquisition. The infection usually begins in the lungs even though the chest roentgenogram may be normal. Clinical findings are nonspecific; most patients present with symptoms of fever and weight loss of at least 1 month's duration. When untreated, many cases eventually develop severe clinical manifestations resembling septicemia. Chest roentgenograms, when abnormal, show interstitial or reticulonodular infiltrates. Many cases have been initially misdiagnosed as disseminated mycobacterial infection or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Patients are often concurrently infected with other opportunistic pathogens, supporting the need for a careful search for co-infections. Useful diagnostic tests include serologic tests for anti-H. capsulatum antibodies and HPA, silver stains of tissue sections or body fluids, and cultures using fungal media from blood, bone marrow, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and other tissues or body fluids suspected to be infected on clinical grounds. Treatment with amphotericin B is highly effective, reversing the clinical manifestations of infection in at least 80% of cases. However, nearly all patients relapse within 1 year after completing courses of amphotericin B of 35 mg/kg or more, supporting the use of maintenance treatment to prevent recurrence. Relapse rates are lower (9 to 19%) in patients receiving maintenance therapy with amphotericin B given at doses of about 50 mg weekly or biweekly than with ketoconazole (50-60%), but controlled trials comparing different maintenance regimens have not been conducted. Until results of such trials become available, our current approach is to administer an induction phase of 15 mg/kg of amphotericin B given over 4 to 6 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with 50 to 100 mg of amphotericin B given once or twice weekly, or biweekly. If results of a prospective National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease study of itraconazole maintenance therapy document its effectiveness, alternatives to amphotericin B may be reasonable.\r"

Coccidioidal serologies were positive on initial testing in 83% of the patients in whom such serologic testing was performed. Sera from 39% of patients were positive for TP antibodies while 74% had CF antibodies. Eleven of 12 seronegative patients had pulmonary disease (Group 1 or 2). Serologic results of other patients sent to a single reference laboratory were similar, with 26% positive for immunodiffusion TP antibodies and 79% positive for immunodiffusion CF antibodies. For the 77 patients in this study, the CD4-lymphocyte count was below 0.250 X 10(9) cells/L in 46 of the 55 patients who had this test performed, and a low CD4 count was significantly associated with mortality (p less than 0.01). At the time of follow-up, 32 of the 77 patients (42%) had died. There were significantly more deaths in those with diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2) than in other groups (p less than 0.001). Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole were all used as antifungal therapies. Outcome could not be related to the therapy used. Of note, 3 patients developed coccidioidomycosis while receiving ketoconazole for other conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Extrapulmonary pneumocystosis is not limited to patients in any discrete risk group for HIV infection. Patients with HIV infection who develop extrapulmonary pneumocystosis frequently do not have concurrent P. carinii pneumonia. Signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis are nonspecific but when present are frequently referable to the tissues or organs involved. Extrapulmonary pneumocystosis can be diagnosed by examination of tissue biopsies from affected sites using standard histologic techniques. Therapy with antimicrobial agents used to treat P. carinii pneumonia has been effective in some patients. An association between use of aerosolized pentamidine for prevention of P. carinii pneumonia and development of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis has been suggested but remains unconfirmed. Other factors such as the use of zidovudine and duration of immunodeficiency may also be important to the pathogenesis of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis. Further studies are needed to better identify risk factors that may predispose patients to the development of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis.\r"

Studying the effects of intravenous dantrolene (3 mg/kg) on electrically stimulated skeletal muscle, we found that this approach does not conclusively distinguish between normal humans and those susceptible to malignant hyperthermia but nonetheless yielded important information about the action of dantrolene in man and in MH. Supramaximal single- and multiple-pulse stimulation of the common peroneal nerve produced stable torque responses of the dorsiflexor muscles (monitored in vivo), which dantrolene suppressed. With the multiple-pulse stimulation (5-6 pulses) this torque suppression was significantly less in MH-susceptible subjects than in control subjects. This distinction, also observed in MH swine, confirms this animal as a good model for human MH. That dantrolene's effect in MH can be more completely reversed with high frequency stimulation is intriguing; presumably, excitation-contraction coupling differs in MH and normal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "There is currently considerable interest in using disposable concentric needle (CN) electrodes for clinical electromyography (EMG). To determine how these electrodes compare with reusable CN electrodes, we have compared signals recorded by these two electrode types from the same muscle in normal subjects. We also made similar recordings with two groups of reusable electrodes. There was no difference in the features of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) recorded by the two groups of reusable electrodes. Disposable electrodes performed satisfactorily in conventional EMG examination. However, compared to reusable electrodes, the disposable electrodes recorded MUAPs with smaller amplitude and area but with the same area:amplitude ratio and MUAP duration. The physical and electrical properties of the CNE groups were also investigated. Disposable electrodes had lower electrical resistance and greater capacitance than reusable electrodes when measurements were made in saline. Photomicrographs showed that the disposable electrodes had smaller recording surfaces and that the central wire was frequently eccentric in the cannula. The differences in electrical recording characteristics could be due to differences in the size of the recording surface, eccentric placement of the central wire in the cannula or differences in the metal used for the central wire. We conclude that electrical and physical testing may not predict the recording characteristics of needle electrodes. Electrophysiologic testing is necessary to determine how EMG signals recorded by new types of electrodes compare with those recorded by currently used electrodes.\r"

Positive responses for MH were obtained in the patients and in one of the parents on each occasion. The hypothesis of intrauterine MH with its pharmacogenetic propensity for heat production is considered as a possible etiological factor which may cause abnormalities of a congenital nature.\r"

This method was tested on recordings of the EMG interference pattern (IP) from the biceps muscle of normal subjects. Normal values of this feature in the biceps muscle are described. There was a good concordance between the ENAMP measurements made by subjective assessment and by automatic analysis and the ENAMP values correlated strongly with a previously described feature of the IP called the upper centile amplitude.

The current-voltage (I/V) curve of the whole sodium (Na+) current (INa) in normal myotubes was similar to that obtained from DMD myotubes. However, the inactivation curve of the whole INa was different in normal myotubes when compared to that obtained from DMD myotubes. Addition of 10(-4) M tetrodotoxin (TTX, a fast INa blocker) decreased the whole INa in both preparations. The inorganic calcium (Ca2+) blocker manganese (Mn2+) completely blocked the remaining TTX-resistant INa of normal myotubes and decreased this current in DMD myotubes leaving behind a TTX- and Mn2(+)-insensitive INa that was insensitive to the Ca2+ blocker desmetoxyverapamil ((-)D888). The slow inward barium current (IBa) of both normal and DMD myotubes was blocked by Mn2+ and (-)D888. However the kinetics of the slow channel in normal myotubes was different from that of DMD myotubes. This study demonstrates the presence of a TTX- and Mn2(+)-insensitive INa in DMD myotubes. This channel may contribute to the increase of intracellular Na+ [( Na]i) in DMD and allow Ca2+ to enter the cells through the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, thus contributing to calcium loading.\r"

Submaximal electrical stimuli preferentially activated sensory rather than motor axons, but submaximal magnetic stimuli did not. The onset latency, amplitude, area and duration of responses elicited electrically or magnetically with the butterfly coil during routine sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were similar, and motor and sensory conduction velocities were comparable when studied over long segments of nerve. However, the motor conduction velocities with magnetic and electrical stimulation differed by as much as 18 m/sec in the across-elbow segment of ulnar nerve. Thus, recent developments in magnetic stimulator design have improved the focality of the stimulus, but the present butterfly coil design cannot replace electrical stimulation for the detection of focal changes in nerve conduction velocity at common entrapment sites, such as in the across-elbow segment of the ulnar nerve.\r"

Although the mean duration of MUAPs usually was significantly shorter in polymyositis than in controls, the average scatter of MUAPs duration was the same in the 2 groups. The average incidence of polyphasic MUAPs was 4 times higher in patients than in controls, as was the incidence of those of long duration. To avoid misinterpretation of EMG findings due to an excess of polyphasic MUAPs, a greater number of individual potentials than usually recommended should be collected allowing a valid estimate of the mean duration of MUAPs of simple configuration.\r"

In normal muscle, on stimulation of the nerve or muscle at 30 to 100 Hz, the AP responses showed decrement in amplitude, one-third of which was attributable to failure of neuromuscular transmission and two-thirds to failure of muscle membrane excitation. On stimulation at 1 to 5 Hz, the AP responses showed very little decrement, while the contractile responses showed significant fade in tension, due to failure of E-C coupling or contractility. In muscle from patients with generalized MG, stimulation of the nerve at all frequencies (1 to 100 Hz) caused much greater decrement in APs and fade in tension responses than in normal muscle, due mainly to failure of neuromuscular transmission. However, at 100 Hz, 40% of the decrement in APs was due to failure of muscle membrane excitation, and at 1 to 5 Hz, 40% of the fade in tension was due to failure of E-C coupling or contractility, as in normal muscle. On direct stimulation the contraction and half-relaxation times were slower and the tetanic tension was smaller than in normal muscle, especially in the MG patient with thymoma. Caffeine-induced contractures were smaller in MG muscle than in normal muscle. These results indicate that while the weakness of MG muscle is due mainly to failure of neuromuscular transmission, it is also partly due to reduced E-C coupling or contractility.\r"

We studied 35 muscles with FP, sampling 20 sites each with concentric and monopolar needles. The concentric needle identified 0.88 +/- 3.44 (mean +/- standard deviation) more sites with spontaneous activity. Although statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test P less than .03), this difference in sensitivity did not appreciably affect diagnostic interpretation. Subjects described the concentric needles as more painful. Needle insertions in 25 other muscles demonstrated that needle movement generated the majority of FP. We suggest that the increased tissue injury caused by concentric needles may account for both their increased sensitivity and discomfort.\r"

In order to verify the effect of a decreased protection from free radical attack on the sprouting, the multiple innervation in the extensor digitorum longus muscle, following sciatic nerve crush and regeneration, was studied in vitamin E-deficient rats. Thus, the innervated end-plates and the end-plates with multiple innervation were studied with histochemical and electrophysiological techniques. The percentage of innervated end-plates was similar in both groups at 30 as well as at 60 days after nerve crush. Nevertheless, multiple innervation was found in a larger part of the muscle and it lasted longer in the deficient rats. This finding is discussed in relation to some of the major hypotheses of sprouting; it may be relevant in the treatment of some lesions of peripheral nerve.\r"

Thermographic abnormalities were seen only in the hands and fingers, and the pattern did not follow the dermatome of the clinically involved cervical root. When compared to electromyography, thermography provided no additional diagnostic information. Thus, thermography does not have an established role in the evaluation of patients with cervical radiculopathy.\r"

  ".U": "91042784\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the effects of reduced neuromuscular activity on the expression of proteins associated with contractile and metabolic functions and the size of single muscle fibers in the cat soleus. Adult cats were spinalized (Sp) at T12-T13 and maintained in a healthy condition for 6 months. Some of the cats were trained to weight-support (Sp-WS) for 30 minutes per day beginning one month posttransection. Cross-sectional area (CSA), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), and myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities were determined in a population of single fibers identified in frozen serial cross-sections. Each fiber was categorized as either light or dark based on its staining density for qualitative myosin ATPase, alkaline preincubation (pH 8.75). The Sp (45%) and Sp-WS (31%) groups had significantly higher percentages of dark ATPase fibers than control (less than 1%). All dark ATPase fibers were shown to react positively for a fast myosin heavy chain monoclonal antibody, while some of these fibers showed a reaction to both fast and slow myosin heavy chain antibodies. Overall mean fiber CSA were significantly smaller (approximately 25%) than control in both Sp groups. In the Sp-WS, but not the Sp cats, the dark fibers were larger than the light fibers (P less than 0.05), suggesting a preferential effect of postural training on the ATPase converted fibers. There were no significant differences among the three groups in any of the mean enzyme activities for either ATPase type fiber. However, there was a general tendency for the Sp cats to have elevated GPD and ATP activities per muscle; this appeared to be directly related to the percentage of fibers staining darkly for myosin ATPase. These data indicate that 6 months after spinalization some of the fibers of the slow muscle developed fast myosin staining patterns and oxidative and glycolytic enzyme profiles that are normally exhibited in fast fatigue-resistant motor units. Periods of daily weight-support appear to ameliorate some of these adaptations to spinalization. Further, the observation that SDH activities are maintained at control values in spinalized adult cats as well as in spinalized kittens (unpublished observations) suggest that, at least in the soleus, skeletal muscle fibers can maintain their oxidative potential even though there is a marked reduction in neuromuscular activity for 6 months.\r"

We discuss each of these techniques, along with their associated shortcomings, in detail.\r"

A supramaximal electrical stimulus S1 was delivered at the wrist, and followed by a supramaximal stimulus S2 in the upper arm, which was either electrical (electrical collision studies), or magnetic (magnetic collision studies). The interstimulus interval was varied by 0.2 msec increments from the time of complete cancellation of the S2 evoked motor response onwards, to include the entire span of recovery of that compound motor action potential. Collision curves were obtained for both magnetic and electrical stimuli by plotting the amplitude of the motor response elicited by S2 as a function of the interstimulus interval. In all seven normal ulnar nerves, comparison of the collision curves showed that the S2 evoked motor response is restored significantly more slowly when magnetic stimulation is used. This finding is best explained by longitudinal dispersion of the stimulus induced by the magnetic coil relative to conventional electrical stimulation, the large fibers being stimulated further away from the coil than the small ones. This interpretation is confirmed by the findings obtained with the same method in two cases of ulnar neuropathy, and by comparison of different intensities of magnetic stimulation.\r"

Central motor delay between the cortex and the C-7 and L-5 measured 6.7 +/- 1.2 ms and 13.1 +/- 3.8 ms, respectively. Mean spinal cord motor conduction velocity measured 65.4 m/s. MEP amplitude expressed as a percentage of the maximum M wave was never less than 20% of the M wave. A value of less than 10% is considered abnormal. MEP latency increases linearly with age and central motor delay is longer in older subjects. Compound muscle action potentials and absolute MEP amplitudes decreased linearly with age. In multiple sclerosis (MS), MEP latency and central delay were often very prolonged. The MEP was more sensitive than the SEP in MS. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, MEP latencies were only modestly prolonged; the characteristic abnormality was reduced amplitude. When pseudobulbar features predominated MEPs were often absent. The MEP was of normal latency in Parkinson's disease, but age-related amplitude was often increased. MEP latency and amplitude were normal in Huntington's disease. Abnormal MEPs persisted several months after stroke despite good functional recovery. The MEP could be used to advantage to demonstrate proximal conduction slowing and block in demyelinating neuropathies. In plexopathy, ability to elicit an MEP several days after onset of paresis was good evidence of neuronal continuity in motor fibers.\r"

The elasticity and tensile strength of nerve trunks and their capacity to resist traction deformation reside in the fascicular tissue, while the epineurium provides a protective cushion against compression. The microstructure of nerve trunks provides the basis for a classification of nerve injuries into five degrees of severity with partial and mixed types--each with a clearly defined pathology and distinguishing clinical features. Following a transection injury, changes occur in the severed axons, endoneurial tubes, fasciculi, and nerve trunk. The type of injury and the nature of these changes determine the outcome of axon regeneration.\r"

Misdirected regeneration is so commonly encountered that motor axons appear to enter and regenerate to muscles in an almost random manner. Thus, when there are several choices, as usually is the case with more proximal nerve or plexus repairs, misdirected reinnervation accounts in many incidences for a poor quality of functional restoration. The regenerative capacities of type I and type II motor axons appear to differ. Proprioceptors and other sensory axons have been shown to reinnervate inappropriate end organs. Consequently, deranged central reflex modulation and disturbed orderly recruitment of motor units according to the size principle also contributes to this problem. Central re-education or adaptation to misdirected regeneration does not occur to any appreciable extent.\r"

Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect.\r"

The importance of not only preoperative electromyographic studies but also the intraoperative use of stimulation and stimulation and recording of nerve action potentials (NAPs) for lesions in continuity has been stressed. Operative techniques such as neurolysis, NAP recordings, suture, split repair, and interfascicular graft repair have been reviewed and some commentary on results provided.

  ".W": "Functional testing is useful to monitor the natural history of several neuromuscular disorders, and to measure the efficacy of therapeutic agents in clinical trials. A major limitation of functional testing is that a single test is often not appropriate throughout all stages of disease. The same limitation holds true for other measurements of disease progression. MMT and quantitative myometry become technically difficult to perform and lack sensitivity to disease progression at some stages in the course of DMD, ALS, and spinal muscular atrophy. Other limitations of functional testing are its lack of sensitivity to detect a subtle improvement or decline in muscle strength, and the difficulty of applying standard statistical methods to analyze disease progression or therapeutic efficacy. The advantages of functional testing outweigh the limitations. Function testing uses daily activities to monitor disease progression. Patient's appreciate improvements in function more readily than improvements in muscle strength. Functional testing is easily standardized and is reliable. It can be performed, with little or no expense, in almost any clinical setting. The primary challenge for investigators who wish to incorporate functional tests is to identify functional tests that best measure the natural history of the specific disease under investigation. Further, functional testing allows the clinician to provide an educated guess on the likely future course of disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The cause of childhood hyperactivity (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder) is unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that cerebral glucose metabolism might differ between normal adults (controls) and adults with histories of hyperactivity in childhood who continued to have symptoms. Each patient was also the biologic parent of a hyperactive child. None of the adults had ever been treated with stimulant medication. To measure cerebral glucose metabolism, we administered 148 to 185 MBq (4 to 5 mCi) of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose intravenously to 50 normal adults and 25 hyperactive adults while they performed an auditory-attention task. Images were obtained for 30 minutes with a Scanditronix positron-emission tomograph with a resolution of 5 to 6 mm. Whole-brain and regional rates of glucose metabolism were measured with computer assistance by two trained research assistants, working independently, who were blinded to the subjects' status (control or hyperactive). RESULTS. Global cerebral glucose metabolism was 8.1 percent lower in the adults with hyperactivity than in the normal controls (mean +/- SD, 9.05 +/- 1.20 mg per minute per 100 g vs. 9.85 +/- 1.68 mg per minute per 100 g; P = 0.034). In the adults with hyperactivity, glucose metabolism was significantly reduced, as compared with the values for the controls, in 30 of 60 specific regions of the brain (P less than 0.05). Among the regions of the brain with the greatest reductions in glucose metabolism were the premotor cortex and the superior prefrontal cortex. When the seven women with hyperactivity or the six patients with learning disabilities were omitted from the analysis, the results were similar. CONCLUSIONS. Glucose metabolism, both global and regional, was reduced in adults who had been hyperactive since childhood. The largest reductions were in the premotor cortex and the superior prefrontal cortex--areas earlier shown to be involved in the control of attention and motor activity.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Laron-type dwarfism, which is characterized by the clinical appearance of isolated growth hormone deficiency with elevated serum levels of growth hormone and decreased serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), has been described in approximately 50 patients. This condition is caused by a deficiency of the cellular receptor for growth hormone, and it is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, as indicated by an equal sex distribution and a high rate of consanguinity in affected families. We studied 20 patients (19 females and 1 male, 2 to 49 years of age), from an inbred Spanish population in southern Ecuador, who had the clinical features of Laron-type dwarfism. RESULTS. Seventeen patients were members of two large pedigrees. Among the 13 affected sibships, there were 19 affected and 24 unaffected female siblings and 1 affected and 21 unaffected male siblings. The patients' heights ranged from 10.0 to 6.7 SD below the normal mean height for age in the United States. In addition to the previously described features, 15 patients had limited elbow extensibility, all had blue scleras, affected adults had relatively short extremities, and all four affected women over 30 years of age had hip degeneration. Basal serum concentrations of growth hormone were elevated in all affected children (30 to 160 micrograms per liter) and normal to moderately elevated in the adults. The serum level of growth hormone-binding protein ranged from 1 to 30 percent of normal; IGF-I concentrations were low--less than or equal to 7 micrograms per liter in the children and less than or equal to 66 micrograms per liter in the adults (normal for Ecuadorean women, 98 to 238). Serum levels of IGF-II and growth hormone-dependent IGF-binding protein-3 were also low. CONCLUSIONS. We describe an inbred population with a high incidence of growth hormone-receptor deficiency resulting in a clinical picture resembling Laron-type dwarfism but differing principally in showing a marked predominance of affected females. This population, of Mediterranean origin, may be genetically related to other reported populations with Laron-type dwarfism, but with the genetic defect linked to a trait resulting in the early fetal death of most affected males.\r"

  ".U": "91042843\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Haemophilus influenzae type b is the leading cause of invasive bacterial disease in young children. The capsular polysaccharide vaccine does not protect children at greatest risk (those under the age of 18 months), but a polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine has proved to be more immunogenic in this age group. METHODS. We enrolled 114,000 infants in Finland in an open, prospective, randomized trial of a H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (polyribosylribitol phosphate-diphtheria toxoid [PRP-D]). Children born on odd-numbered days were vaccinated at the ages of 3, 4, 6, and 14 to 18 months; those born on even-numbered days formed the control group and received the same vaccine at the age of 24 months. RESULTS. After three doses of the vaccine there were 4 cases of verified bacteremic H. influenzae type b disease in the group receiving early vaccination, as compared with 64 cases in the control group, between the ages of approximately 7 and 24 months. The protective efficacy of the vaccine was thus 94 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 83 to 98). No serious adverse effects were reported. The immune response to the conjugate vaccine was characteristic of a T-cell-dependent response when studied in a cohort of 120 infants. The primary immunization series resulted in a geometric mean concentration of anticapsular antibody of 0.53 micrograms per milliliter at the age of seven months, and the fourth dose evoked an anamnestic response, with a mean antibody concentration of 45.22 micrograms per milliliter. CONCLUSIONS. A new conjugate vaccine consisting of the capsular polysaccharide of H. influenzae type b covalently linked to a protein carrier (PRP-D), administered to infants beginning at the age of 3 months, is highly effective in protecting young Finnish children (7 to 24 months old) against invasive H. influenzae type b infections.\r"

Because Native American children are at much higher risk for invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b infection than white children, we compared the antibody responses to H. influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine in healthy Apache and white children. RESULTS. The concentrations of H. influenzae type b antibody after immunization with polysaccharide vaccine were approximately 10-fold lower in 24-month-old Apache children than in whites of a similar age (P less than 0.01). The decreased response involved H. influenzae type b antibodies of the IgG, IgM, and IgA classes. Concentrations of IgG antibody to tetanus toxoid did not differ significantly, and IgG antibodies to diphtheria toxoid were only twofold lower (P = 0.028). Although total IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were higher in two-year-old Apaches than in whites (all P less than 0.001), IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses were lower (both P less than 0.001). Among the Apaches, individual immunoglobulin levels and allotypes were not significantly correlated with their antibody responses to H. influenzae type b polysaccharide. CONCLUSIONS. Apache children have significant impairment of their antibody response to H. influenzae type b polysaccharide and little or no impairment of their antibody responses to protein toxoids. This immunodeficiency may explain the high incidence of H. influenzae type b infection in this population.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The prevention of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease requires a vaccine that is effective when administered during the first six months of life. The infants of Alaska Natives are at particularly high risk of invasive H. influenzae type b disease. METHODS. To evaluate the protective efficacy of a H. influenzae type b polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (polyribosylribitol phosphate-diphtheria toxoid [PRP-D]), we enrolled 2102 Alaska Native infants in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which either the vaccine or a saline placebo was administered at approximately two, four, and six months of age. RESULTS. After 3969 subject-years of follow-up and 32 episodes of H. influenzae type b disease, the overall incidence of invasive disease was not reduced significantly in the vaccinated subjects (6.0 cases per 1000 patient-years), as compared with the placebo controls (9.6) or with other Alaska Native infants (6.0). After one, two, or three doses there was no significant protective efficacy with the vaccine; after three doses the efficacy was only 35 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -57 to 73). The lack of efficacy was not related to the age at onset of disease, age at immunization, type of disease, degree of Alaska Native heritage, time after immunization, or year of the study. Levels of H. influenzae type b anticapsular antibody in recipients of the vaccine became significantly higher than levels in those who received placebo only after the second and third doses. Even after the third dose, only 48 percent of the vaccinated infants had antibody levels of more than 0.1 microgram per milliliter (geometric mean titer, 0.18). Antibody responses did not vary with the level of maternally acquired antibody, degree of Alaska Native ancestry, or age at time of the first or second immunizations, but they increased with increasing age at time of the third dose (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. We found no evidence that the PRP-D vaccine provides significant protection, at least for Alaska Native infants, against invasive diseases caused by H. influenzae type b. The ineffectiveness of the vaccine paralleled its limited immunogenicity.\r"
