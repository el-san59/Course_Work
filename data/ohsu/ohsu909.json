  ".W": "IL-5 renders BCL1-CL-3 (CL-3) cells responsive to IL-2 by increasing the number of high affinity IL-2R, whereas IL-4 prohibits such action of IL-5 to prepare CL-3 cells responsive to IL-2. Here we have found that genes for p75kDa-IL-2R and p55kDa-IL-2R are differentially regulated by IL-4 and IL-5. Nonstimulated CL-3 cells constitutively express mRNA for p75kDa-IL-2R and p55kDa-IL-2R. IL-5 stimulation principally augments the expression of p75kDa-IL-2R mRNA (4- to 8-fold), although modestly increasing the expression of p55kDa-IL-2R mRNA. Kinetic studies have revealed a maximal increase in p75kDa-IL-2R mRNA expression at 12 h and a decline thereafter, substantiating our previous kinetic study of the expression of high affinity IL-2R after the IL-5 stimulation. By contrast, IL-4 stimulation modestly increases the expression of p75kDa-IL-2R mRNA, whereas markedly reducing the expression of p55kDa-IL-2R mRNA, irrespective of whether CL-3 cells were stimulated with IL-4 alone or together with IL-5 and IL-2. Moreover, addition of IL-4 into the culture containing IL-5 and IL-2 causes striking reduction in the level of J-chain mRNA, which otherwise is markedly induced by stimulation with IL-5 and IL-2. These results clearly illustrate the differential regulation of p75kDa- and p55kDa-IL-2R-gene expression by IL-5 and IL-4, and reinforce our notion that increased expression of high affinity IL-2R induced by IL-5 is responsible for the IL-2 competent state, and decreased expression of p55kDa-IL-2R by IL-4 is responsible for IL-2 unresponsive state.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently provided evidence that C-reactive protein (CRP) could act as an up-regulatable substrate for membrane-associated neutrophil serine protease(s). The resultant degradation of CRP yielded small soluble bioactive peptides that inhibit many of the proinflammatory functions of activated neutrophils and could oppose the tissue destructive potential of these cells. We report on the reverse phase HPLC separation of the small TCA-soluble peptides obtained when CRP is degraded with nonstimulated or PMA-stimulated neutrophils and purified neutrophil membranes. The amino acid sequence of seven peptides isolated from the CRP digest has been ascertained and synthetic peptides homologous to these sequences have been synthesized. Three of the synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 201-206 (CRP-III), 83-90 (CRP-IV), and 77-82 (CRP-V) of the intact protein were identified to significantly inhibit superoxide production from activated neutrophils at 50 microM whereas CRP-III and CRP-V in addition inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis at this concentration. These peptides act additively and their action likely involves the signal transduction pathways for neutrophil activation.\r"

  ".U": "90347203\r", 
  ".W": "In this report we present evidence that not all human peripheral blood monocytes mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and that this function may be determined on an individual cell by both the type and level of expression of FcR, and by the state of cellular activation and/or differentiation. Although the diverse range of effector and regulatory functions performed by human monocytes suggests the possibility of distinct subsets, it is not clear whether observed functional heterogeneity reflects the presence of true monocyte subpopulations, or whether this diversity represents a continuum of maturational states present in the peripheral circulation. In an attempt to address this question, we investigated the ability of human monocytes to carry out ADCC at the single cell level, with emphasis on the role of the three FcR for IgG (Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII) in mediating cytotoxicity. Using a modified plaque assay, 58.3% +/- 4.9 of freshly isolated monocytes mediated ADCC, as evidenced by the formation of lytic plaques in monolayers of ox erythrocyte (oxE) target cells. Significant increases in the number of plaque-forming cells were observed after positive selection by flow microfluorimetry for those monocytes expressing high levels of Fc gamma RI and Rc gamma RII, but not Fc gamma RIII. Bispecific antibodies composed of Fab fragments of anti-oxE antibody covalently coupled to Fab fragments of anti-Fc gamma R antibodies were used to independently evaluate the ability of Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII to mediate single cell cytotoxicity. Significant increases in the number of plaque-forming cells were observed in the presence of anti-Fc gamma RI x anti-oxE and anti-Fc gamma RII x anti-oxE bispecific antibodies, confirming the efficiency of Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII as cytotoxic trigger molecules on human monocytes. Incubation of monocytes with purified rIFN-gamma and granulocyte macrophage-CSF, but not IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, or TNF-alpha, also resulted in significant increases in the number of monocytes mediating cytotoxicity, suggesting that cytotoxic ability at the single cell level may be influenced by factors which effect monocyte activation and differentiation, respectively. Overall, these studies demonstrate that freshly isolated human monocytes are heterogeneous in their ability to mediate ADCC, and suggest that this functional diversity arises not from discrete subpopulations of cells, but from a continuum of maturational/activational states present within the peripheral circulation.\r"

As assessed by either secretion of TNF-alpha or IL-1, some of the R-chemotype LPS manifest significant activity on these normally LPS-unresponsive cells. The expression of IL-1 activity by R-LPS-stimulated C3H/HeJ macrophages was unaffected by IFN-gamma; however, this cytokine significantly enhanced TNF-alpha production by the same cells. The R-chemotype LPS preparations alone were not able to activate C3H/HeJ macrophages to become tumoricidal but activity could readily be demonstrated in the presence of IFN-gamma. Of potential importance is the observation that the profile of relative activity of the various R-chemotype LPS preparations for macrophage activation does not parallel that previously obtained by us for the C3H/HeJ B-lymphocyte activation.\r"

Addition of granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF to cultures of spleen cells from chronically infected mice restored the plaque-forming cells (PFC) response to normal levels. Splenic adherent cells from chronically infected mice were deficient in their ability to reconstitute the PFC response of accessory cell-depleted normal spleen cells. Preincubation of splenic adherent cells from infected mice with GM-CSF restored their ability to reconstitute the PFC response of adherent cell depleted cultures. Ia Ag expression by splenic adherent cells from chronically infected mice was significantly lower compared to Ia Ag expression of cells from normal mice. Incubation of splenic adherent cells from chronically infected mice for 48 h with GM-CSF increased levels of Ia Ag expression to approximately those of uninfected mice. Peritoneal macrophages from infected mice produced IL-1 after incubation with GM-CSF at levels equivalent to those produced by similarly treated control macrophages. Spleen cells from chronically infected mice showed significant induction of IL-2 mRNA after GM-CSF treatment, and the addition of the anti-IL-2 mAb to GM-CSF supplemented cultures of spleen cells from infected mice blocked the restoration of the anti-SRBC PFC response. Thus, the ability of GM-CSF to restore the anti-PFC response to SRBC appears to involve the up-regulation of accessory cell function that includes increased Ia Ag expression and the induction of IL-1 production. These events also involve increased IL-2 production with resultant up-regulation of the response to SRBC by spleen cells from infected mice. Finally, it was shown that treatment of infected mice with rGM-CSF completely restored their depressed PFC production in vivo.\r"

This analysis has revealed, in addition to a previously characterized NF-kappa B binding site, the presence of seven potential protein-DNA interaction sites within this fragment. Interestingly, they are clustered in the regions where in vivo T cell-specific nuclease hypersensitive sites have been previously identified. Binding sites for four potential transcription factors have been mapped precisely by methylation-interference experiments. Sequence comparisons show that one of them is homologous to the Y box present in the promoter regions of MHC class II genes. Identification of several protein-DNA interactions clustered within the J beta 2-C beta 2 intron and the presence of binding sites for two well-characterized transcription factors suggest a transcriptional regulatory function for this region.\r"

  ".W": "Mature, resting rodent, and primate B lymphocytes express two membrane Ig isotypes, IgM and IgD. Although membrane IgD production by these cells is regulated at a transcriptional level, and does not require deletion of the C mu gene, C mu has been deleted in all of the IgD-secreting tumor cells that have been studied. These IgD-secreting tumors, which include two mineral oil-induced plasmacytomas and three IgD-switch variants of an IgM-secreting hybridoma, might not, however, be representative of the rare IgD-secreting cells generated in response to an immune stimulus. A recent study of mice injected with a goat antibody to mouse IgD has demonstrated the generation of a relatively large secretory IgD response in these animals. We have now produced hybridomas by fusing spleen cells from these mice with a non-Ig-secreting plasmacytoma. Two of these hybridomas, KWD-1 and KWD-2, secrete IgD and express cell membrane IgD. Both of these hybridomas were found to have deleted the C mu gene. KWD-2 produces a delta-chain mRNA and a delta-chain protein similar in size to those previously reported for normal secreted mouse IgD; however, KWD-1 synthesizes a secretory delta-chain mRNA that is approximately 0.25 kb smaller than the KWD-2 secretory delta-chain mRNA and secretes IgD with a delta-chain that is approximately 21 kDa smaller than the secretory delta-chain of KWD-2. ELISA studies with epitope-defined anti-delta mAb indicate that KWD-2 has both delta Fc (C delta 3) [corrected] and delta Fd (C delta 1) [corrected] determinants, whereas KWD-1 has delta Fc but not delta Fd. These studies also demonstrate that the Ag-binding site of KWD-1 is not deleted because KWD-1 specifically binds goat IgG. Northern blot analyses with exon-specific probes indicate that while both KWD-1 and KWD-2 synthesize kappa-chain mRNA and delta-chain mRNA that includes the VH, C delta hinge, and C delta 3 exons, the C delta 1 exon is present only on the KWD-2 delta-chain mRNA. Southern blot analysis confirms that the C delta 1 exon has been deleted in KWD-1, but not KWD-2. We have previously noted that a secretory delta-chain mRNA that is similar in size to that produced by KWD-1 accounts for approximately 25% of the splenic secretory delta-chain mRNA produced by goat anti-mouse IgD antibody-injected mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Our previous analyses of peritoneal Ly-1 B cells indicate that a high percentage express VH genes of the VH11 and VH12 families, and that this bias is due to clonal selection. The antibodies encoded by these genes bind the same hapten, phosphatidyl choline (PtC). Twenty-one of 73 hybridomas generated from fusions with peritoneal Ly-1 and Ly-1 sister population B cells of B10.H-2aH-4bp/Wts mice produce anti-PtC specific antibodies. We show here that 19 of these express VH11 and VH12 family genes and two express VH36-60 family genes. To assess whether there is a bias in VH gene use among non-PtC-specific hybridomas we analyzed the remaining 52 hybridomas for VH family expression by using VH family-specific probes in an RNA dot blot assay and by Ig mRNA sequencing. We find a seven-fold increase in the expression of the VHS107 family genes, and only slight differences in the expression of VH genes of other families relative to splenic B cells. We attribute the increase in VHS107 gene expression to clonal selection inasmuch as five of the seven VHS107+ hybridomas express the same VH gene (V11) and VL association is nonrandom. The bias in VH gene use among the entire panel of 73 peritoneal hybridomas is to the extent that approximately one-third express one of three genes: the V11 gene of the S107 family, the CH34 gene of the VH11 family, and the VH12 family gene.\r"

  ".W": "UM4D4 (CDw60), the surface molecule of a novel antigen-independent T-cell activation pathway, was found to be highly expressed on lesional psoriatic T cells. To examine whether UM4D4 represents a T-cell activation pathway for psoriatic T cells, a T-cell line was initiated from an acute skin lesion and cloned by limiting dilution. Clonality was verified by analysis of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. All T-cell clones tested, whether CD4+2H4+CD8-, CD4+2H4-CD8-, or CD4-CD8+CD11b-, expressed UM4D4 and were activated by the monoclonal antibody anti-UM4D4. Lesional psoriatic T-cell clones were heterogeneous in the degree of anti-UM4D4-induced proliferation and in their production of IL-2 and gamma-interferon. Lymphokines released by anti-UM4D4 activation were capable of inducing ICAM-1 and HLA-DR expression on cultured normal keratinocytes. Thus, the high expression of UM4D4 on T-cells in psoriatic skin provides an alternative mechanism for T-cell activation that may be operative in the psoriatic lesional milieu. Indeed, activation of lesional T-cells through the UM4D4 molecule resulted in release of lymphokines that directly induced keratinocytes to express a phenotype displayed in psoriatic skin lesions.\r"

We did histologic, immunohistologic, and gene rearrangement studies on 10 biopsies from patients with persistent nodular T-cell-rich skin lesions refractory to topical therapy. Based on clinical and immunohistochemical findings, no discrimination was possible between reactive lesions and malignant lymphoproliferations. Histologically, most of the cases contained T-lymphocytic infiltrations that were assumed to be reactive; however, in four biopsies a neoplastic infiltration could not be excluded. Although the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes were in germ-line configuration in nine of 10 cases, indicating a predominantly polyclonal lymphocellular infiltrate, in one patient without clinical evidence of malignant lymphoma at presentation a clonally rearranged TCR beta chain gene with the IgH gene in germ-line configuration was detected. One year later, the patient developed a cutaneous pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma and subsequently a large cell anaplastic (CD30+) T-cell lymphoma in an inguinal lymph node. We conclude that clonal T-cell proliferations can be detected by molecular genetic analysis of T-cell-rich, small lymphoid infiltrates of the skin. This finding may precede development of an overt malignant T-cell lymphoma.\r"

In addition, three of 21 CTCL patients had antibodies to the EBV-associated antigen, rheumatoid arthritis nuclear antigen (RANA), as determined by double immunodiffusion, whereas none of the control sera contained anti-RANA antibodies. These results indicate that antibodies against EBV antigens are found with a higher frequency and concentration in patients with CTCL when compared to controls and suggest that EBV products might serve as a possible stimulus for the development of this malignant disease.\r"

The disease is characterized immunopathologically by circulating and tissue-bound IgG class autoantibodies (EBA antibodies) to the basement membrane zone of stratified squamous epithelium. Previous studies have shown that circulating and tissue-bound EBA antibodies are heterogenous in their ability to activate complement and have raised the possibility that functional heterogeneity might be related to IgG subclass restriction. In this study, we have characterized the IgG subclasses of the circulating and tissue-bound EBA antibodies by immunofluorescence and have examined the relationship between IgG subclass and complement binding. The results show that EBA antibodies belonging to all IgG subclasses are present in the skin of EBA patients. The results also show that EBA antibodies belonging to all IgG subclasses are present in the sera of most patients, including sera with and without complement binding EBA antibodies.\r"

Recent clinical trials indicate that the use of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN patches) can reduce the incidence of infusion failure and hence the costs of re-infusion. In this study we conduct an economic evaluation of this new pharmaceutical application to determine whether the use of such patches results in hospital resource cost savings. Time-to-first infusion failure probabilities from a placebo-controlled trial are used to model the sequential failure problem as a Markov process. Using estimated staff and materials costs for first and subsequent infusions, we calculate the expected cost per infused patient to time t for treatment and control groups. Using this simple comparative cost method, results indicate that the net impact on hospital resources from patch usage is dependent upon the total required length of infusion time. Analysis of infusion time thresholds indicates that for patients requiring long-term (t greater than 50 hours) periods of infusion the use of patches is likely to generate resource savings. We conclude that to realize such resource savings clinical decisions to infuse with GTN patches should incorporate the prior probability that the total required length of infusion time exceeds 50 hours.\r"

The animals were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) control, 27 animals; 2) oral heparin (200 or 500 U/ml), 17 animals; 3) oral hydrocortisone (0.3 mg/ml), 10 animals; or 4) oral heparin (200, 500, or 1000 U/ml) with hydrocortisone (0.3 mg/ml), 24 animals. After 10 days of treatment, the animals were sacrificed and the tumor size and degree of neovascularization were compared to the pretreatment data. Heparin treatment alone stimulated angiogenesis and resulted in tumor growth greater than in the control group (p less than 0.001). Administration of hydrocortisone alone caused a minimal reduction in tumor growth and had a minimal effect on angiogenesis (p less than 0.05 vs. control group). In contrast, heparin administered with hydrocortisone inhibited both angiogenesis and tumor growth (p less than 0.001 vs. control group). These studies suggest that angiogenesis modulators are worthy of further study as feasible means of treating human neurofibrosarcoma.\r"

Similarly, ictal study demonstrated increased rCP in 93% of the patients. In 69% of the patients, the SPECT studies were able to demonstrate both increased rCP on the ictal scan and decreased rCP on the interictal scan in the same location, corresponding to the eventual site of surgery.

We used the A10 vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) line to probe mechanisms underlying ET-induced contractions. Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and pH were monitored in A10 monolayers using the fluorescent dyes Fura-2 and 2,7-bis-carboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein, respectively. Synthetic porcine ET induced rapid and transient increases in [Ca2+]i (EC50 value, 0.75 nM; maximum, approximately 6-fold above basal). External Ca2+ removal did not block the ability of ET (0.5 or 50 nM) to increase initial [Ca2+]i, although [Ca2+]i returned to prestimulus levels faster as compared with that seen in the presence of external Ca2+. Total cell 45Ca2+ content decreased within 30 sec and remained below prestimulus values for at least 20 min (34 +/- 2% decrease after 5 min, n = 3) in ET-stimulated VSMC. ET stimulated a transient rise in inositol trisphosphate formation in [3H]myo-inositol labeled VSMC, peaking in 30 sec (62 +/- 20% increase, n = 3). In contrast, ET-stimulated diacylglycerol formation in [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled VSMC was sustained and biphasic, exhibiting two peaks at 15 sec (41 +/- 16% increase) and at 5 min (75 +/- 7% increase, n = 3).

The goal of this study was to determine if acute alcohol administration affected gonadal steroid hormone levels after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to normal healthy women. hCG was used to simulate the hormonal milieu during the first trimester of pregnancy. Ten women were studied during the mid-luteal phase (between days 17 and 23) of their menstrual cycle. Plasma estradiol, progesterone and prolactin were measured before and after simultaneous administration of 5000 I.U. of hCG (Profasi) and alcohol or placebo solution under double-blind conditions. There was a significant increase in plasma estradiol (P less than .001) and prolactin levels (P less than .01) after hCG and alcohol administration but not after hCG and placebo administration. Plasma progesterone increased significantly (P less than .001) above base line after hCG and placebo administration but this was not observed after hCG and alcohol administration. Since progesterone is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy, alcohol's attenuation of the expected progesterone response to hCG stimulation could increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. An alcohol-induced increase in estradiol after hCG administration could contribute to risk for fetal dysmorphology during the first trimester of pregnancy.\r"

In both experimental setups a dose dependency of the elimination parameters, half-life and clearance, was observed with a calculated turning point around 250 microM. In the medium of rat hepatocytes incubated at low (0.1 microM) to high (2000 microM) FUDR, the majority of the metabolites consisted of the catabolite alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine. The nucleobase metabolites, 5-fluorouracil and its primary product 5,6-dihydro-5-fluorouracil, approached apparent steady-state levels comprising 10 to 15% of the initial concentration. In the intracellular phase of hepatocytes incubated at 300 microM FUDR almost 90% of the FUDR-derived material was alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine, whereas essentially no unchanged FUDR could be detected. Similar results were obtained at extracellular FUDR concentrations exceeding 300 microM. In the isolated perfused rat liver, the clearance decreased to 15 to 20% of the corresponding values when the initial concentration was raised from 24 to 2400 microM. At the end of perfusion alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine comprised 90 to 95% of FUDR-derived total radioactivity in the tissue even at initially 2400 microM FUDR, although at this FUDR dosage 20% of the substrate remained unmetabolized in the medium. These results suggest that the limitation of hepatic FUDR elimination is not due to saturable hepatic metabolism but must be due to saturable uptake of these pyrimidine derivatives across the cellular membrane of parenchymal liver cells.\r"

We have developed a rapid and sensitive assay to determine the basal and stimulated release of defined breakdown products of endothelium-derived nitrogen oxides, i.e., nitrite and nitrate. Formation and/or release of these nitrogen oxides was time- and concentration-dependently stimulated by various endothelium-dependent vasodilators and was decreased by NG-methyl-L-arginine and L-canavanine, compounds that most likely inhibit the endothelial enzymatic conversion of L-arginine into nitrogen oxides. In addition to nitrogen oxide, hydroxylamine was shown to have pharmacological and physico-chemical properties similar to endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s). Moreover, hydroxylamine release was detected in stimulated bovine aortic endothelial cells. We suggest that hydroxylamine represents one endothelium-derived nitrogen oxide within the group of biologically active nitrogen oxides.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were conducted to examine the role of cerebrovascular guanylate cyclase in hypoxic cerebral vasodilatation. In arteries mounted in vitro for measurements of isometric tension, 20 min of hypoxia (bath oxygen partial pressure, approximately 15 Torr) significantly increased cyclic GMP levels from 16 to 32, from 15 to 25 and from 20 to 38 pmol/g in rabbit common carotid, internal carotid and basilar arteries. These increases were blocked either by pretreatment with 3 microM methylene blue, or by removal of the vascular endothelium. Methylene blue also significantly delayed hypoxic relaxation in the basilar and internal carotid arteries, and blocked transient hypoxic vasoconstriction in the common carotid. Together, these in vitro results demonstrate that vascular cytosolic guanylate cyclase participates in an endothelium-dependent manner in the direct effects of hypoxia on cerebral arteries, and that the nature of this participation varies significantly between arteries. When methylene blue (20 mg/kg) was administered in vivo, however, it had no effect on the magnitude of hypoxic cerebral vasodilatation as determined by both local (mass spectrometry) and global (venous outflow) methods of blood flow measurement. This latter finding suggests that: 1) large and small cerebral arteries may differ significantly in terms of either endothelial function or sensitivity to methylene blue; or 2) feedback regulation of other mechanisms of hypoxic cerebral vasodilatation compensate for the effects of guanylate cyclase inhibition. Additional experiments using other inhibitors of cytosolic guanylate cyclase and/or vessels isolated from the cerebral microcirculation will be necessary to distinguish between these possibilities.\r"

  ".W": "Hormonal, renal and blood pressure effects of SCH 39370, a selective inhibitor of neutral metalloendopeptidase (endopeptidase 24.11, NEP), were studied in a chronic, congestive heart failure (CHF) model produced by coronary artery ligation in the rat. Sham-operated control rats and rats with CHF were treated either with vehicle or SCH 39370, 30 mg/kg s.c. b.i.d. for 2.5 days. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and urinary excretion of cyclic GMP (cGMP) were clearly raised in rats with CHF as compared with controls during vehicle treatment. SCH 39370 caused a further increase in plasma ANP in CHF rats but not in control rats. Urinary excretion of immunoreactive ANP and cGMP increased during SCH 39370 treatment both in CHF rats and in controls. SCH 39370 treatment resulted in an initial increase in urine volume in rats with CHF whereas urine sodium excretion did not change significantly. No changes in renal function due to SCH 39370 treatment were seen in control rats. Systolic blood pressure, plasma renin activity and urine excretion of catecholamine metabolites (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl acetic acid and metanephrines) did not change during SCH 39370 treatment either in controls or in CHF rats. We conclude that the NEP-inhibitory compound SCH 39370 is capable of increasing plasma ANP concentration and urinary excretion of cGMP in rats with chronic CHF. In this severe heart failure model, the possible beneficial effects of additional ANP increments may be blunted, however. NEP inhibitors offer a novel approach to study the significance of ANP elevation in chronic CHF.\r"

Infusion of fentanyl (3 and 10 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced an immediate decrease in heart rate in conscious Wistar rats, whereas mean arterial pressure did not change significantly. Heart rate returned to control levels within 2 min of the injection, except after the largest dose of fentanyl when heart rate remained decreased for 5 min. Administration of 10 micrograms/kg of fentanyl caused a marked increase in right atrial pressure (3.9 +/- 0.3 mm Hg, n = 9, P less than .001) associated with 3.5-fold increase in the plasma IR-ANP concentration (168 +/- 17 pg/ml vs. 567 +/- 116 pg/ml, n = 9, P less than .01). In contrast, right atrial pressure decreased by 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (P less than .05) in response to infusion of 3 micrograms/kg of fentanyl with a slight increase (34%) in plasma IR-ANP. One microgram per kilogram i.v. of fentanyl had no effect on hemodynamic variables and plasma IR-ANP levels. Infusion of V1 antagonist (5 micrograms/kg/min for 25 min) did not affect basal or fentanyl-stimulated changes in hemodynamics or plasma IR-ANP concentration in Wistar rats. Infusion of fentanyl (3 and 10 micrograms/kg) in the LE and DI rats produced similar short-lasting heart rate reductions as seen in Wistar rats. Furthermore, injection of 10 micrograms/kg of fentanyl decreased blood pressure and increased plasma IR-ANP and right atrial pressure in both strains. The analysis of changes in plasma IR-ANP and right atrial pressure in response to fentanyl showed that for a given increase in right atrial pressure, a smaller amount of IR-ANP was released in the DI than in the LE rats. These results demonstrate that at higher fentanyl doses, the increased ANP release is mediated primarily by elevation of right atrial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro bioactivation of 8-MOP was studied in liver microsomes of male CD-1 mice. In 10-min incubations with 40 microM [14C]8-MOP, covalent binding (mean +/- S.D.) was 1.8 +/- 0.4, 3.1 +/- 0.6 and 5.4 +/- 0.4 nmol/mg protein, respectively, in microsomes from mice pretreated for 3 days with vehicle, phenobarbital or beta-naphthoflavone (BNF). A monoclonal antibody (MAb 1-7-1), which recognizes isozymes of cytochrome P-450 induced by 3-methylcholanthrene (P1-450 and P3-450), selectively inhibited the metabolism of 8-MOP (-57%) and covalent binding of its metabolites (-40%) in microsomes from mice pretreated with BNF, but had no effect in microsomes of mice pretreated with phenobarbital or vehicle. Monoclonal antibody 2-66-3, which recognizes the major isozymes of rat cytochrome P-450 induced by phenobarbital and unknown isozymes in the mouse, enhanced the covalent binding of 8-MOP metabolites in microsomes of mice pretreated with vehicle (+74%), phenobarbital (+44%) or BNF (+31%) without affecting the disappearance of 8-MOP. Preincubation of liver microsomes from BNF-pretreated mice with 40 microM 8-MOP decreased the activity of 7-ethoxycoumarin de-ethylase in a time-dependent manner. Preincubation with 40 microM 8-MOP for 10 min decreased the Vmax from 3.4 to 1.2 nmol/min/mg protein and increased the Michaelis constant from 46 to 90 microM, thus demonstrating mixed competitive and noncompetitive inhibition of 7-ethoxycoumarin de-ethylase. Cysteine trapped three-fourths of the reactive intermediates of 8-MOP but was ineffective in preventing the irreversible inhibition of 7-ethoxycoumarin de-ethylase activity or the 45% spectral loss of cytochrome P-450. Cysteine was ineffective probably because it did not prevent the irreversible binding of metabolites of 8-MOP to cytochrome P-450. There was no spectral evidence that 8-MOP formed cytochrome P-420 or metabolite-intermediate complexes with cytochrome P-450. These findings support the hypothesis that irreversible inactivation of cytochrome P-450 by 8-MOP is caused by modification of the apoprotein by reactive metabolites.\r"

  ".W": "By using combined in vitro radioreceptor binding and autoradiographic techniques and [3H]spiroperidol (in the presence of the 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 receptor blocker ketanserin) as a ligand, the pharmacological properties and the anatomical localization of dopamine (DA) DA-2 receptors sites in rat mesenteric vascular tree were analyzed. [3H]Spiroperidol was bound by sections of rat mesentery in a manner consistent with the labeling of DA-2 receptors, with a Kd value of 2.48 nM and with a maximum binding value of 159 fmol/mg of protein. Light microscopic autoradiography revealed specific [3H]spiroperidol binding sites primarily in the adventitial layer and in the adventitial-medial border as well as in the intimal layer. Adventitial and adventitial-medial binding sites disappeared after 6-hydroxydopamine sympathectomy. In contrast, chemical sympathectomy was without effect on intimal [3H]spiroperidol binding sites. The density of adventitial and adventitial-medial binding sites was higher in medium and small sized vessels than in larger ones. These findings are indicative of the existence of DA-2 receptors sites located both prejunctionally (6-hydroxydopamine-sensitive) and in the intimal layer. Prejunctional mesenteric DA-2 receptors may be involved in the inhibition of noradrenaline release from sympathetic neuroeffector junctions. The functional significance of intimal [3H]spiroperidol binding sites, if any, should be established in future studies.\r"

Canthaxanthin is a synthetic, non-provitamin A carotenoid that is highly lipid-soluble; it colors the skin by deposition in the epidermis and subcutaneous fat. It is readily available through commercial tanning salons and mail advertisements, but despite advertising claims that it is harmless, investigation regarding the safety of oral doses of canthaxanthin in humans has not been conducted. It is not approved as a prescription or an over-the-counter preparation by the Food and Drug Administration. The drug's present means of distribution makes monitoring for toxic effects difficult. Thus, the frequency of adverse effects associated with canthaxanthin use, such as bone marrow suppression, is unknown. Even if there is only a small risk of these toxic effects, the use of the drug for cosmetic purposes does not justify this risk.\r"

Five patients had mild acidosis (standard bicarbonate pre-dialysis 18 to 21 mmol/liter). The amino acid results were compared with data from age- and sex-matched healthy controls and with data obtained earlier from non-dialyzed patients with chronic uremia. In the hemodialysis patients threonine, serine and valine were significantly reduced in plasma compared to the controls, whereas the plasma concentrations of aspartate, glycine, citrulline, cysteine and arginine were elevated. In aspartate, glycine, citrulline, cysteine and arginine were elevated. In muscle, valine, serine and the tyrosine to phenylalanine ratio were low. Compared with the untreated uremic patients the hemodialysis patients exhibited fewer significant abnormalities, but the general pattern was similar, demonstrating that hemodialysis is unable to fully correct the amino acid abnormalities of chronic uremia. There was a significant positive correlation between both pre-dialysis and post-dialysis plasma bicarbonate and the muscle valine concentration, suggesting that mild acidosis may be causally related to the inbalance of the branched-chain amino acids in uremia. Extra- and intracellular serine depletion in the presence of high plasma glycine may reflect a defect in the metabolism of glycine to serine in hemodialysis patients, related to a lack of metabolizing renal tissue.\r"

We hypothesized that neutral endopeptidase inhibition (NEP-I) increases sodium excretion and that this effect would be potentiated in the presence of an isolated increase in intrarenal ANF. In seven anesthetized dogs, ANF was infused into one renal artery to produce pathophysiologic concentrations in the supplemented kidney while the control kidney received physiologic circulating concentrations of ANF. In the control kidney, NEP-I (SQ 28,603) produced significant increases in urine flow, absolute sodium excretion and fractional sodium excretion while glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained constant. These renal actions of NEP-I were associated with marked increases in urinary excretion of ANF and cyclic GMP consistent with decreased renal degradation and increased biologic activity of ANF. All of these effects were significantly greater in the supplemented kidney. The present study suggests that NEP-I produces natriuresis which appears to be independent of changes in GFR. In addition, while NEP-I mimics the renal action of pathophysiologic levels of ANF, NEP-I also potentiates the natriuretic effects of pathophysiologic concentrations of ANF as observed in congestive heart failure or hypertension.\r"

Animals on a low sodium intake received the same diet, but deionized water and served as controls (C) (N = 12). After 35 days blood pressure was only slightly increased to 136 +/- 9 in NaCl-rats versus 120 +/- 2 mm Hg in C (NS). Glomerular filtration rate, plasma cGMP and plasma ANP remained unaltered. Determination of total ANP receptor characteristics in these rats indicated a significant down-regulation of ANP receptors in salt loaded rats. Since ANP-stimulated cGMP formation was not affected by salt loading, the roles of clearance (C) and of biologically active (B) receptors were further evaluated at 21 degrees C on freshly isolated and acid washed (pH 5) glomeruli in seven animals after 35 days of salt loading and in seven animals on a low sodium intake. B-receptors were assessed by blocking C-receptors with 4-23 cANP. C-receptor numbers were lower in NaCl-rats (97 +/- 8 vs. 184 +/- 14 fmol/mg protein in C; N = 7; P less than 0.02), while C-receptor affinity was increased (Kd: 12 +/- 3 pM in NaCl-rats vs. 22 +/- 5 pM in C; P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Each animal had two anastomoses with full-thickness bites for both suture techniques. Animals were killed at 4 months (n = 6) or 8 months (n = 5). Eight animals died before they were scheduled to be put to death (mean 6 weeks postoperatively). Transverse sections of the trachea were taken at the level of the anastomoses and three tracheal rings above and below each anastomosis. The cross-sectional area of the tracheal lumen of these transverse sections was measured with a computerized digitizing tablet. A percent luminal area for each anastomosis was calculated relative to the mean tracheal area three rings above and three rings below the anastomosis. There was little difference between interrupted and continuous technique with either suture material (p = 0.94). In 10 animals that each served as its own control for suture material, PDS anastomotic area was 55.0% +/- 4.1% of mean tracheal luminal area compared with 45.4% +/- 7.1% for Vicryl anastomoses (p = 0.06). Histologic analysis revealed a more intense inflammatory reaction surrounding multifilament Vicryl sutures with more rapid resorption and greater subsequent fibrosis relative to the reaction seen with PDS sutures. A small clinical experience with seven infants has confirmed short-term satisfactory clinical performance of continuous PDS suture for tracheal anastomosis.\r"

In group I, progressive brain tissue acidosis and hypercapnia were recovered with pulsatile assistance. In group II, brain tissue acidosis and hypercapnia were recovered completely with pulsatile assistance but incompletely without it. In group III mild acidosis was eliminated with pulsatile assistance where the pH was significantly higher than in groups I and II, and brain tissue carbon dioxide pressure was significantly lower than in groups I and II with and without pulsatile assistance. Brain tissue hypoxia was severe in group I, slight in group II, but not found in group III. We concluded that a perfusion flow rate will decide the safe period, and a pulsatile assistance will promote brain protection at any flow rate in profoundly hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

Despite 22 years of experience with PN, its use during pregnancy has only recently been reported. Most of this information is anecdotal but suggests that this mode of therapy is safe, effective, and occasionally lifesaving. PN during pregnancy has been used most often to provide adequate nutrition for those who suffer from prolonged hyperemesis or who have difficulty absorbing adequate nutrients because of such conditions as Crohn's disease. The proper selection and administration of dextrose, fat, protein, vitamins, trace elements, and electrolytes for pregnant women have been associated with favorable perinatal outcomes. Fat emulsion use does not appear to be associated with any abnormal outcomes. Preterm deliveries and intrauterine fetal growth retardation appear to relate to preexisting or coexisting medical or obstetric complications. Principles for PN with all patients would apply during pregnancy. As with any therapy, the benefits must be weighed against the risks and costs. Sufficient favorable clinical experience over the last 10 years suggests that PN is a relatively safe and effective method for reversing maternal malnutrition and promoting normal fetal growth and development.\r"

There was no apparent correlation between contamination rate of the infusate and subsequent sepsis of the patients. Reasons for the high prevalence of Staphylococcus epidermidis include ubiquitous diffusion of this microorganism, marked affinity for prosthetic devices, especially by the slime-producing strains, and increased susceptibility of debilitated cancer patients to infection. Recognition that the possibility exists for infusate contamination during compounding should alert all members of the Nutritional Support Team to use aseptic technique when preparing and handling the intravenous solutions.

In many instances, the health agency will not be able to demonstrate an excess of the condition in question or establish an etiologic linkage to an exposure. Nevertheless, a systematic, integrated approach is needed for responding to reports of clusters. In addition to having epidemiologic and statistical expertise, health agencies should recognize the social dimensions of a cluster and should develop an approach for investigating clusters that best maintains critical community relationships and that does not excessively deplete resources. Health agencies should understand the potential legal ramifications of reported clusters, how risks are perceived by the community, and the influence of the media on that perception. Organizationally, each agency should have an internal management system to assure prompt attention to reports of clusters. Such a system requires the establishment of a locus of responsibility and control within the agency and of a process for involving concerned groups and citizens, such as an officially constituted advisory committee. Written operating procedures and dedicated resources may be of particular value. Although a systematic approach is vital, health agencies should be flexible in their method of analysis and tests of statistical significance. The recommended approach is a four-stage process: initial response, assessment, major feasibility study, and etiologic investigation. Each step provides opportunities for collecting data and making decisions. Although this approach may not always be followed sequentially, it provides a systematic plan with points at which the decision may be made to terminate or continue the investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Inactivation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB-1) has been associated with the aetiology of many types of human cancers, leading to the classification of RB-1 as an anti-oncogene or tumour suppressor gene. Given that the protein product of RB-1 (Rb) has a nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity in vitro, it is possible that Rb regulates transcription of certain genes. The promoter of the c-fos gene might be a target for regulation by Rb, because both v-fos and RB-1 are associated with the induction of osteosarcomas in mice and humans, respectively. Also, fos expression is thought to be required for quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle, making the fos promoter an attractive target for suppressors of cell growth. Here we report that Rb can repress c-fos expression and AP-1 transcriptional activity in both serum-induced and cycling 3T3 cells. We have mapped a cis-acting element in the human c-fos promoter that can confer repression by Rb to a heterologous promoter. We have the termed the cis-acting sequence regulated by Rb the retinoblastoma control element.\r"

A remarkable finding is that the predominant binding proteins (immunophilins) for cyclosporin A and FK506, cyclophilin and FKBP respectively, are peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans-isomerases that are potently and selectively inhibited by their respective ligands. Here we report the complementary DNA and derived amino-acid sequences of human FKBP from Jurkat cells and also the efficient overexpression in Escherichia coli of fully active, recombinant human FKBP.

Catalysis probably involves the isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds in the folding protein chains. Cyclosporin A inhibits folding catalysis by cyclophilin. Here we report the isolation, cloning, sequencing and expression of another protein with prolyl isomerase activity from Neurospora crassa which is unrelated to cyclophilin and which also catalyses slow steps in protein folding. This protein does, however, show sequence similarity to a human protein that binds to another, recently discovered immunosuppressive drug, FK506. Moreover, it shares 39% identity with the carboxy-terminal 114 residues of a cell-surface protein from the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. Catalysis of folding by the FK506-binding protein from N. crassa is inhibited by FK506, but not by cyclosporin A. Thus, at least two different classes of conformationally active enzymes (conformases) exist that catalyse slow steps in protein folding. Both occur in a wide variety of cells and are inhibited by immunosuppressive drugs.\r"

In seven patients without subarachnoid hemorrhage (five with unruptured arteriovenous malformations and two with aneurysms), the CO2 vasoreactivity was tested on the side of the middle cerebral artery with normal flow velocities opposite the lesion. A baseline CO2 reactivity test was obtained in each patient and then repeated under constant intravenous infusion of nimodipine, 2 mg/hr. Nine patients with ruptured aneurysms who were rated at Hunt and Hess Grades 1 or 2 were operated on within 1 to 3 days after the hemorrhage and treated with nimodipine, 2 mg/hr, given intravenously. In these patients, CO2 vasoreactivity was tested during the second week after the hemorrhage, when the middle cerebral artery velocity was increased by at least 50% of the initial value or more. Nimodipine was then discontinued and, 48 hours later, when the middle cerebral artery velocity was still in the same range, CO2 vasoreactivity was tested again. Two months later, after full recovery from the subarachnoid hemorrhage and normalization of the velocities, a third measurement of CO2 reactivity was obtained as a baseline control. No significant effect of nimodipine on CO2 vasoreactivity could be demonstrated in any of the test periods. In the second week after a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a significant reduction of the cerebrovascular response to CO2 was found (P less than 0.005).\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the cerebral hemodynamic changes associated with obliteration of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), we studied 26 patients undergoing total microsurgical AVM resection during isoflurane and N2/O2 anesthesia. Detectors were placed 5 to 6 cm from the margin of the lesion and in a homologous contralateral position. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using the intravenous xenon-133 technique before and after AVM resection, during both hypocapnia and normocapnia at each stage. Intraoperative changes in CBF were related to a risk score system based on the patient's history and preoperative angiograms. Seven otherwise healthy patients undergoing spinal surgery were studied to control for anesthetic effects. Patient demographic and clinical data for the AVM group conformed to the expected strata of a large AVM population. The CBF increased after excision (22 +/- 1 ml/100 g/min before excision to 30 +/- 2 ml/100 g/min after excision; mean +/- SE, n = 25, P less than 0.002) without a hemispheric difference. CO2 reactivity increased slightly after excision (4.2 +/- 0.3% change/mm Hg before excision to 4.7 +/- 0.3% change/mm Hg after excision; n = 14, P less than 0.02). The baseline CBF and CO2 reactivity were not different from the control group. There was a weak correlation between the risk score and the percentage of change in the ipsilateral CBF, with a trend for the patients with the lowest risk to have the lowest CBF changes after resection. There was no relationship between CO2 reactivity and risk grade. None of the patients awoke from anesthesia with unexpected neurological deficits. The highest CBF increases were associated with postoperative brain swelling in one patient and fatal intracerebral hemorrhage in another. Both patients had normal CO2 reactivity before excision. One patient suffered postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage, attributable to technical problems, and had no increase in CBF. We conclude that, with an acute increase in the arteriovenous pressure gradient (and cerebral perfusion pressure) that results from shunt obliteration, there is an immediate global effect of AVM resection to increase CBF. Cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 remains intact both before and after excision.\r"

In this report, we describe the deletion mutations, and we present models for their generation. Detailed analysis of two deletions with insertions indicates that these mutations occurred as a result of template switching during plus-strand DNA synthesis. The analysis also indicates that fragments of viral RNA generated by the viral RNase H endonuclease are used as templates and contribute to the sequences inserted at the deletion junctions.\r"

A flow cytometric method was developed, based on size and two-color fluorescence of NK cell-target conjugates, for the characterization and sorting of highly purified subpopulations--killer cells, nonkiller binder cells, and free cells. Ultrastructural examination revealed that granule content was reduced in the killer cells and absent in most of the binder cells. Quantitative differences in the expression level of HLA class I, CD11b (C3bi receptor), and CD16 (receptor for the Fc portion of IgG) antigens could differentiate the subsets. The killer phenotype was HLAlo, CD11bvery hi, and CD16very lo; the binder phenotype was CD11bhi and CD16lo; and the free-cell phenotype was CD11blo and CD16hi. Cell activation was not requisite for lytic function because no difference in either expression of activation markers or cell cycle could be established among the sorted subpopulations. Although recycling function was inhibited, retention of lytic activity was enriched 4-fold in the sorted killer cell population. These results represent characterization of a successful bulk isolation of competent killer, nonkiller binder, and free cells in human NK-cell populations and should aid our understanding of NK-cell development, lineage, and function.\r"

After being ingested, the organism escapes from the phagolysosome into the host-cell cytoplasm. N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-phallacidin, a specific stain for actin filaments (F-actin), demonstrates that within 1 hr of initiation of infection, the bacteria become surrounded by host-cell cytoplasmic actin filaments. By 3 hr, long projections of F-actin begin to form at one end of the bacteria. These actin structures colocalize with the actin-bundling protein alpha-actinin as well as with tropomyosin. Microinjection of fluorescently labeled alpha-actinin in living cells demonstrates that the formation of these F-actin projections is associated with bacterial movement, actin filaments rapidly assembling behind the bacteria as they migrate through the cytoplasm. These F-actin tails attain lengths up to 40 microns. The movement of the bacteria through the cytoplasm is rapid, 0.12-1.46 microns/sec. Within 2 min of cytochalasin D (0.5 micrograms/ml) treatment, all bacterial intracellular movement stops, and additional bacteria-associated actin assembly is blocked. A nonmotile Listeria mutant induces comparable actin assembly and moves at speeds similar to the wild type, indicating that the forces required for intracellular bacterial movement are generated by the host cell. L. monocytogenes can dramatically stimulate host-cell actin assembly in a directional manner, which serves to rapidly propel the bacteria through the cytoplasm, allowing the organisms to move to peripheral membranes and spread to uninfected cells.\r"

Until now, the absence of CA II in kidney of CA II-deficient patients has not been shown directly, and the status of the membrane-associated CA in kidney of CA II-deficient patients has been unclear. To address these questions, we analyzed urinary membranes and soluble fractions from normal and CA II-deficient subjects. The CA activity in membrane fractions of normal urine was found to comprise two components--(i) a vesicle-enclosed, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sensitive fraction, which was shown immunochemically to be the 29-kDa CA II, and (ii) an SDS-resistant fraction, which was due to native and cleaved forms of the 35-kDa, membrane-anchored isozyme CA IV. Urinary membranes from CA II-deficient patients showed little or no SDS-sensitive activity and no immunoreactivity for CA II, providing direct evidence that their mutation, which produces CA II deficiency in erythrocytes, also affects CA II in kidney. CA IV activity and immunoreactivity were present in normal amounts in urinary membranes from CA II-deficient patients. We conclude from the enzymatic and immunological evidence presented that both CA II and CA IV are present in urinary membranes from normal subjects, that renal CA IV is present but renal CA II is absent in urinary membranes from patients with the CA II-deficiency syndrome, and that the methods presented should be useful in studying renal CA II and renal CA IV in other disorders of impaired bicarbonate reabsorption.\r"

In this study we introduce a higher resolution optical imaging system that offers spatial and temporal resolution exceeding that achieved by most alternative imaging techniques for imaging cortical functional architecture or for monitoring local changes in cerebral blood volume or oxygen saturation. In addition, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for the activity-dependent intrinsic signals evoked by sensory stimuli, and studied their origins and wavelength dependence. These studies enabled high-resolution visualization of cortical functional architecture at wavelengths ranging from 480 to 940 nm. With the use of near-infrared illumination it was possible to image cortical functional architecture through the intact dura or even through a thinned skull. In addition, the same imaging technique proved useful for imaging and discriminating sensory-evoked, activity-dependent changes in local blood volume and oxygen saturation (oxygen delivery). Illumination at 570 nm allowed imaging of activity-dependent blood volume increases, whereas at 600-630 nm, the predominant signal probably originated from activity-dependent oxygen delivery from capillaries. The onset of oxygen delivery started prior to the blood volume increase. Thus, optical imaging based on intrinsic signals is a minimally invasive procedure for monitoring short- and long-term changes in cerebral activity.\r"

These double-stranded DNA genomes replicate intrachromosomally and are matured and encapsidated linked to DNA sequences flanking the dispersed, integrated phage genomes. We have developed an in vitro system that employs crude lysates prepared from cells late in the Mu lytic cycle and that is proficient for both maturation and encapsidation of D108 DNA. Different forms of phage DNA were packaged at different efficiencies, with a circular pSC101::D108cts10 plasmid being most efficient, linearized plasmid less so, and mature virion DNA a poor substrate. The addition of purified D108 Ner protein to the reaction had no effect, whereas D108 repressor (c protein) inhibited the reaction. Escherichia coli integration host factor and D108 transposase proteins exerted an inhibitory effect on circular DNA substrates but had little effect on linear DNA packaging. This in vitro system, coupled with that developed for transposition, can now be used to biochemically dissect the protein and substrate requirements of these phages' DNA maturation pathway and the nature of the molecular switch between DNA transposition and encapsidation.\r"

The 142-amino acid extracellular domain (including signal peptide) of R-PTP-alpha is marked by a high serine/threonine content (32%) as well as eight potential N-glycosylation sites but displays no similarity to known proteins. Genetic mapping assigns the gene for R-PTP-alpha to mouse chromosome 2, closely linked to the Il-1a and Bmp-2a loci. The corresponding mRNA (3.0 kilobases) is expressed in most murine tissues and most abundantly expressed in brain and kidney.

  ".W": "The ability to respond to specific antigens develops in a programmed fashion. Although the antibody repertoire in adults is presumably generated by stochastic combinatorial joining of rearranged heavy variable, diversity, and joining (VH-DH-JH) and light (VL-JL) chains, experimental evidence in the mouse has shown nonrandom utilization of variable gene segments during ontogeny and in response to specific antigens. In this study, we have performed sequence analysis of 104-day human fetal liver-derived, randomly isolated constant region C+ mu transcripts and demonstrate a consistent preference during fetal life for a small subset of three highly conserved VH3 family gene segments. In addition, the data show that this preferential gene segment utilization extends to the DHQ52 and the JH3 and JH4 loci. Sequence analysis of two \"sterile\" DH-JH transcripts suggests that transcriptional activation of the JH-proximal DHQ52 element may precede initiation of DH-JH rearrangement and influence fetal DH utilization. Sequence comparisons reveal striking nucleotide polymorphism in allelic gene segments which is poorly reflected in the peptide sequence, implying considerable evolutionary selection pressure. Although vertebrate species utilize a variety of strategies to generate their antibody repertoire, preferential utilization of VH3 elements is consistently found during early development. These data support the hypothesis that VH3 gene segments play an essential role in the development of the immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Previously we described specific in vitro interactions between PC12 cells, a cloned, catecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma cell line derived from the rat adrenal medulla, and bovine adrenal medullary endothelial cells. We now demonstrate that these interactions induce the PC12 cells to acquire physical and biochemical characteristics reminiscent of chromaffin cells. Under coculture conditions involving direct cell-cell contact, the endothelial cells and the PC12 cells reduced their rates of proliferation; upon prolonged coculture PC12 cells clustered into nests of cells similar to the organization of chromaffin cells seen in vivo. Within 3 days in coculture with endothelial cells, but not with unrelated control cells, PC12 cells synthesized increased levels of [Met]enkephalin. In addition, PC12 cells, growing on confluent endothelial monolayers, failed to extend neurites in response to nerve growth factor. Neither medium conditioned by endothelial cells nor fixed endothelial cells could by themselves induce all of these different phenomena in the PC12 cells. These results suggest that under coculture conditions PC12 cells change their state of differentiation toward a chromaffin cell-like phenotype. The rapid, transient increase in the expression of the protooncogene c-fos suggests that the mechanism(s) inducing the change in the state of differentiation in PC12 cells in coculture with the endothelial cells may be distinct from that described for the differentiation of PC12 cells--e.g., by glucocorticoids. We propose that similar interactions between endothelial cells and chromaffin cell precursors may occur during embryonic development and that these interactions might be instrumental for the organ-specific differentiation of the adrenal medulla in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "A specific interaction between the class I major histocompatibility complex molecule Kb and thymocytes expressing the antigen receptor from the cytolytic T lymphocyte 2C enhances maturation of T cells of the CD8 lineage in transgenic mice. By analyzing transgenic mice backcrossed to Kbm mutant strains of mice, we have identified five bm mutations of the Kb antigen-encoding gene that alter the positive selection of thymocytes induced by Kb antigen. Compared with Kb, Kbm10 and Kbm1 did not induce significant maturation of 2C T-cell receptor-bearing thymocytes, and Kbm8 antigen positively selected for transgenic thymocytes only weakly. Altering residue 77 of Kb molecule from aspartic acid to serine made Kbm3 and Kbm11 allogeneic targets for the 2C antigen receptor and caused deletion of transgenic thymocytes. This deletion spared T cells that expressed low levels of CD8, a result differing from the total deletion of CD8-bearing T cells seen in mice that expressed the original target alloantigen Ld. This evidence indicates that (i) self-peptides bound to thymic major histocompatibility complex molecules can influence the positive selection of thymocytes and (ii) thymocytes with apparently weak interaction with self-major histocompatibility complex antigens can escape clonal deletion.\r"

  ".W": "A promising strategy for DNA sequencing exploits transposons to provide mobile sites for the binding of sequencing primers. For such a strategy to be maximally efficient, the location and orientation of the transposon must be readily determined and the insertion sites should be randomly distributed. We demonstrate an efficient probe-based method for the localization and orientation of transposon-borne primer sites, which is adaptable to large-scale sequencing strategies. This approach requires no prior restriction enzyme mapping or knowledge of the cloned sequence and eliminates the inefficiency inherent in totally random sequencing methods. To test the efficiency of probe mapping, 49 insertions of the transposon gamma delta (Tn1000) in a cloned fragment of Drosophila melanogaster DNA were mapped and oriented. In addition, oligonucleotide primers specific for unique subterminal gamma delta segments were used to prime dideoxynucleotide double-stranded sequencing. These data provided an opportunity to rigorously examine gamma delta insertion sites. The insertions were quite randomly distributed, even though the target DNA fragment had both A + T-rich and G + C-rich regions; in G + C-rich DNA, the insertions were found in A + T-rich \"valleys.\" These data demonstrate that gamma delta is an excellent choice for supplying mobile primer binding sites to cloned DNA and that transposon-based probe mapping permits the sequences of large cloned segments to be determined without any subcloning.\r"

Two mutations increased both the 2-fold symmetry of the operator and the repression ratio. Although many mutations reduced the repression ratio 3- to 11-fold, some also caused a 2-fold or greater increase in amylase production. Others caused hyperproduction without affecting catabolite repression. Homologous sequences in other catabolite-repressed B. subtilis promoters suggest a common regulatory site may be involved in catabolite repression.\r"

  ".W": "cDNA clones encoding a human blood group Rh polypeptide were isolated from a human bone marrow cDNA library by using a polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment encoding the known common N-terminal region of the Rh proteins. The entire primary structure of the Rh polypeptide has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a 1384-base-pair-long cDNA clone. Translation of the open reading frame indicates that the Rh protein is composed of 417 amino acids, including the initiator methionine, which is removed in the mature protein, lacks a cleavable N-terminal sequence, and has no consensus site for potential N-glycosylation. The predicted molecular mass of the protein is 45,500, while that estimated for the Rh protein analyzed in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels is in the range of 30,000-32,000. These findings suggest either that the hydrophobic Rh protein behaves abnormally on NaDodSO4 gels or that the Rh mRNA may encode a precursor protein, which is further matured by a proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal region of the polypeptide. Hydropathy analysis and secondary structure predictions suggest the presence of 13 membrane-spanning domains, indicating that the Rh polypeptide is highly hydrophobic and deeply buried within the phospholipid bilayer. In RNA blot-hybridization (Northern) analysis, the Rh cDNA probe detects a major 1.7-kilobase and a minor 3.5-kilobase mRNA species in adult erythroblasts, fetal liver, and erythroid (K562, HEL) and megakaryocytic (MEG01) leukemic cell lines, but not in adult liver and kidney tissues or lymphoid (Jurkat) and promyelocytic (HL60) cell lines. These results suggest that the expression of the Rh gene(s) might be restricted to tissues or cell lines expressing erythroid characters.\r"

  ".W": "The uptake and mobilization of (15S)-hydroxy-5,8,11-cis-13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), a major product of arachidonic acid metabolism, was examined with human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes; PMNs). Upon exposure to labeled 15-HETE, PMNs rapidly (15 sec to 20 min) incorporated approximately 20% of the label into phosphatidylinositol, while less than 4% was associated with other phospholipid classes and neutral lipids. This pattern was distinct from that of either labeled arachidonate or labeled(5S)-hydroxy-8,11,14-cis-6-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), which within 20 min were predominantly associated with triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine. After reversed-phase HPLC, greater than 98% of the label in phosphatidylinositol, isolated from PMNs, was released with phospholipase A2. Upon exposure to either chemotactic peptide (FMLP), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or an ionophore (A23187), 15-HETE-labeled PMNs released 15-HETE from phosphatidylinositol and displayed an impaired ability to generate leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 20-OH-LTB4, and 20-COOH-LTB4. Deacylated [3H]15-HETE was converted to (5S,15S)-dihydroxy-6,13-trans-8,11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,15-DHETE), lipoxin A4, and lipoxin B4, each carrying 3H label. PMNs labeled with 5-HETE also released and transformed this HETE when stimulated. However, the profile of labeled products differed between PMNs with either esterified 15-HETE or 5-HETE. When activated, 5-HETE-labeled PMNs generated both 5,20-DHETE and 5,15-DHETE but not labeled lipoxins. Threshold aggregation induced by FMLP with 15-HETE-labeled PMNs was inhibited (approximately 2 orders of magnitude), while the threshold response was relatively unimpaired with either A23187 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced aggregation. Results indicate that 15-HETE is rapidly esterified into phosphatidylinositol of PMNs, which can be mobilized and transformed upon exposure of the cells to a second signal. Moreover, they suggest that eicosanoid intermediates other than arachidonic acid can be stored by cells, released via signal transduction, and oxygenated to generate alternative profiles of eicosanoids.\r"

Djun was mapped by in situ hybridization to position 46E of the second chromosome. It encodes a 1.7-kilobase transcript constitutively expressed at all developmental stages. Functionally, Djun in cooperation with mouse c-fos can trans-activate activator protein 1 DNA binding site when introduced into mammalian cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Djun, much like its mammalian homolog, may activate transcription of genes involved in regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Furthermore, the identification of Djun allows one to exploit the genetics of Drosophila to identify genes in signal transduction pathways involving Djun and thus c-jun.\r"

GVHR chimeras were prepared by transplanting mixtures of splenic T cells and T-cell-depleted BM cells from B10 (I-E-, Mls-1b) or B10.AQR (I-E+, Mls-1b) mice into lethally irradiated AKR/J (I-E+, Mls-1a) recipients. Increased proportions of V beta 6+ T cells reactive to recipient antigens (I-E and Mls-1a) were observed in thymuses from such chimeras 1 or 5 wk after BM transplantation. V beta 6+ T cells observed 1 wk after BM transplantation were derived from mature T cells that had been inoculated into recipients. These cells responded to recipient antigens expressed in the thymus. After 5 wk, thymocytes brightly positive for V beta 6+ were shown not to descend from mature T cells but to differentiate from precursor cells present in the BM inocula. Since V beta 6+ T cells were eliminated in thymuses from non-GVHR chimeras 5 wk after BM transplantation using T-cell-depleted BM cells alone, it appears that GVHR occurring in the thymus at an early stage abrogates thymic stromal functions essential to induction of self-tolerance in the T-cell repertoire. These findings propose a mechanism (autoimmunity) to explain in part the pathogenesis of chronic GVHR.\r"

The remainder of the coding sequence reveals extensive homology with other conventional myosins, especially metazoan nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosin isoforms. Comparisons among available myosin heavy-chain sequences establish that characteristic differences in sequence throughout the length of both the globular myosin head and extended rod-like tail readily distinguish nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosins from striated muscle isoforms and predict a basis for their functional diversity.\r"

Unexpectedly, antisera (including immunopurified) to the alpha subunit but not the beta subunit reacted with a band of 100-kDa proteins in both the microsomal and cytosolic fractions. The immunoreactive 100-kDa proteins are not substrates for ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, or diptheria toxin. Protease digests of the 100-kDa proteins yielded immunoreactive peptides that are distinctly different from those obtained from protease digests of alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The 100-kDa protein(s) reactive with antisera to Gi alpha subunit bind to GTP-agarose but not to ATP-agarose. It is concluded that the immunoreactive 100-kDa proteins in microsomal and cytosolic fractions are structurally distinct G proteins from those linked to receptors in the plasma membrane and other G proteins such as elongation factor 2. Conceivably, the 100-kDa proteins represent a new class of G proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The abilities to introduce foreign DNA into the genome of mice and to visualize gene expression at the single-cell level underlie a method for defining individual elements of a genetic program. We describe the use of an Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene fused to the promoter of the gene for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase that is expressed in all tissues. Most transgenic mice (six of seven) obtained with this construct express the lacZ gene from the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase promoter. Unexpectedly, however, the expression is temporally and spatially regulated. Each transgenic line is characterized by a specific, highly reproducible pattern of lacZ expression. These results show that, for expression, the integrated construct must be complemented by elements of the genome. These elements exert dominant developmental control on the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase promoter. The expression patterns in some transgenic mice conform to a typological marker and in others to a subtle combination of typology and topography. These observations define discrete heterogeneities of cell types and of certain structures, particularly in the nervous system and in the mesoderm. This system opens opportunities for developmental studies by providing cellular, molecular, and genetic markers of cell types, cell states, and cells from developmental compartments. Finally this method illustrates that genes transduced or transposed to a different position in the genome acquire different spatiotemporal specificities, a result that has implications for evolution.\r"

The incorporation of 75Se from 75SeO3(2-) was decreased by adding L-selenocysteine but not by adding the D isomer.

Polyclonal antibodies produced against hamster scrapie amyloid protein (PrP27-30) and used in a neutralization test diminished infectivity of the PrPSc preparations by 1.6 log after intracerebral inoculation and by 1 log after intraperitoneal inoculation. PrPSc was subjected to size-exclusion HPLC; greater than or equal to 60% of the eluted infectious units were recovered from the peak with an apparent mass of 30.4 +/- 0.6 kDa. Characterization by UV absorption spectra, SDS/PAGE, immunoblots, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and neutral sugar and amino sugar analyses demonstrated homogeneity of the infectious units. The neutral sugar and amino sugar compositional analyses revealed high mannose, glucosamine, fucose, and sialic acid content. This demonstrated an extensive posttranslational modification by the complex type of N-linked glycosylation and glycane core of C-terminal glycolipid of PrPSc. The results correspond to the predicted size, composition, and sequence of PrPSc and indicate that this protein may be the only component of scrapie infectious unit or the infectious form of scrapie precursor.\r"

  ".W": "GTP-binding regulatory proteins are generally purified from cholate-extracted membranes in the form of heterotrimers (G proteins) consisting of a GTP-binding subunit (alpha protein) complexed with a tightly interacted heterodimer termed beta gamma. In this study we extracted the proteins from rat brain \"synaptoneurosomes\" using the neutral detergent 1-octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside). Using specific antibodies for detection by immunoblotting and sucrose gradients for analyzing hydrodynamic properties, we found that each species of alpha protein (alpha subunits of stimulatory, inhibitory, and brain GTP-binding proteins) exhibited a broad range (4 S to greater than 12 S) of polydisperse structures with peak values (5 S to 7 S) considerably greater than that of heterotrimeric G proteins. The beta subunit proteins, for example, appeared as a homogeneous peak at 4.4 S within which only a fraction of the total alpha proteins can be associated. Incubation of octyl glucose extracts at 30 degrees C rapidly sedimented the alpha proteins but not the beta proteins. Incubation at 30 degrees C with guanosine 5'[gamma-thio]triphosphate (10-100 microM) prevented rapid sedimentation. Hydrodynamic analysis revealed that all alpha proteins were converted to approximately 4 S structures by the actions of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate without change in the hydrodynamic properties of the beta proteins. Extraction of the membranes with sodium cholate instead of octyl glucoside resulted in complete loss of the large, polydisperse structures of the alpha proteins; the S values were approximately 4 S, in the range for beta proteins. These findings suggest that the transducing GTP-binding proteins in synaptoneurosomes exist as polydisperse, possibly multimer, structures of various size that are stable in octyl glucoside but destroyed by cholate. The polydisperse structures are not associated with beta gamma complexes and are sensitive to the disaggregating effects of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate.\r"

The time of appearance of these changes in hepatocytes during HCV infection, when compared with similar changes in hepatitis D virus infection, suggests a very early replicative phase for HCV. To investigate the early events in HCV infection, we infected two chimpanzees with HCV and obtained blood and liver biopsy samples from them daily during the first 10 days of infection. The early stage of infection with regard to HCV replication, antigen expression, and ultrastructural changes was similar in both chimpanzees. When tested by cDNA/polymerase chain reaction, HCV sequences became detectable in the serum as early as 3 days after inoculation and remained positive through the peak of aminotransferase elevations. In one chimpanzee the peak of virus production appeared to be 7 weeks after inoculation, which was coincident with rising enzyme values. The cytoplasmic antigen, detected by immunofluorescence, and ultrastructural changes, detected by electron microscopy, became positive in hepatocytes 3 and 6 days, respectively, after HCV sequences were first detected in serum. Circulating anti-HCV appeared 13 weeks and 32 weeks after inoculation, respectively, in the chimpanzees. These data indicate a very early replicative phase for HCV and a potentially long period of infectivity before the appearance of anti-HCV.\r"

Sequence analysis indicates that the antibody heavy chain variable regions were derived from members of an expanded hemagglutinin-specific B-cell clone, in conjunction with one of two light chain variable regions. Moreover, the most frequently identified heavy chain variable/light chain variable combination is extremely similar to a heavy chain variable/light chain variable combination that has previously been identified among hemagglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies. The results, therefore, demonstrate that these antibodies bear a close relationship to the immune status of the donor mouse and suggest that simple adaptations of this procedure might allow evaluation of the immune responses of species, such as man, in which conventional hybridoma techniques have to date proven ineffective.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of pharmacological manipulation of atriopeptin (AP) activity on sodium excretion and blood pressure was examined in the rat aortovenocaval (A-V) fistula model of cardiac failure. Introduction of an A-V shunt led to a marked and sustained elevation of plasma AP immunoreactivity and urinary cGMP levels. Further elevation of plasma AP levels by infusion of exogenous peptide induced modest increases in urinary sodium and cGMP excretion and a decrease in blood pressure but these responses were significantly attenuated compared to sham-operated animals. In contrast, low-dose infusion of M + B 22948 (a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor) or thiorphan [a neutral endopeptidase (membrane metallo-endopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.11) inhibitor] induced a natriuresis in A-V fistula rats, which exceeded that seen in control animals given these compounds and matched the peak natriuresis produced in sham-operated animals by high doses of AP. In the doses used, these compounds had little effect on blood pressure. The greater renal efficacy of M + B 22948 in A-V fistula rats is consistent with postreceptor facilitation of AP activity. The effect of thiorphan on sodium excretion was accompanied by a pronounced increase in urinary cGMP and AP immunoreactivity excretion (and was attenuated by anti-AP monoclonal antibody) but could not be explained solely in terms of an increase in circulating AP levels. It is proposed that thiorphan allows filtered AP to reach renal tubule sites that are normally inaccessible to the peptide and are thus protected from down-regulation by high circulating AP levels. The implication of these observations for patients in cardiac failure is the potential for using pharmacological agents to maximize the response to endogenous AP without compromising cardiac function.\r"

  ".W": "1 alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the active metabolite of the steroid hormone vitamin D, is a potent regulator of macrophage and osteoclast differentiation. The mature osteoclast, unlike the circulating monocyte or the tissue macrophage, expresses high levels of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII). This enzyme generates protons and bicarbonate from water and carbon dioxide and is involved in bone resorption and acid-base regulation. To test whether 1,25(OH)2D3 could induce the differentiation of myelomonocytic precursors toward osteoclasts rather than macrophages, we analyzed its effects on the expression of CAII in bone marrow cultures containing precursors common to both cell types. The expression of CAII was markedly increased by 1,25(OH)2D3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In bone marrow, this increase occurred at the mRNA and protein levels and was detectable as early as 24 hr after stimulation. 1,25(OH)2D3 was also found to induce CAII expression in a transformed myelomonocytic avian cell line. These results suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates the level at which myelomonocytic precursors express CAII, an enzyme that is involved in the function of the mature osteoclast.\r"

  ".W": "A desferrioxamine (DFO) infusion test, using a DFO dose of 36.9 +/- 11.2 mg/kg (mean +/- SD), was performed in 50 consecutive dialysis patients undergoing diagnostic bone biopsy. In 30 patients whose bones stained positively for aluminium the serum aluminium level increased by an average of 373 +/- 250.4 ng/ml. The increase in 20 aluminium-negative patients was 231 +/- 179.2 ng/ml (p less than 0.05). Aluminium-positive patients had lower levels of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (336 +/- 442 muleq/ml) than aluminium-negative patients (1278 +/- 1400 muleq/ml; p less than 0.05). A change in serum aluminium level of greater than 200 ng/ml after the administration of DFO was 73 percent sensitive and 50 percent specific, and had a positive predictive value of 69 percent for detecting positive bone aluminium staining. The combination of a baseline immunoreactive parathyroid hormone level less than 200 muleq/ml and a change in serum aluminium of greater than 200 ng/ml after DFO was 90 percent specific and had a positive predictive value of 85 percent. In the second phase of our study, 28 dialysis patients with aluminium toxicity received long-term therapy (11.0 +/- 4.3 months) with DFO at an average starting dose of 41.7 +/- 17.1 mg/kg, administered once weekly. The four deaths which occurred during this treatment involved the only patients who had advanced dialysis dementia. Seven patients with less severe neurological symptoms responded favourably. Fractures decreased from 1.7 fractures/patient/year to 0.1 fracture/patient/year. Muscular strength and overall functional class were improved or stable in 25 patients; myalgias and arthralgias were also stable or improved in 19 patients. After 5-7 months of treatment, serum aluminium levels decreased from 401 +/- 262 ng/ml to 245 +/- 217 ng/ml (p less than 0.01); erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume increased from 86.3 +/- 10.91 fl to 94.1 +/- 9.23 fl (p less than 0.02); and serum calcium decreased from 10.4 +/- 0.94 mg/dl to 9.9 +/- 0.70 mg/dl (p less than 0.02). Serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone levels remained stable in 25 patients, but severe hyperparathyroidism developed rapidly in three patients. Eight patients with transfusional iron overload had no change in serum ferritin levels. Iron depletion developed in six patients, with a decrease in serum ferritin from 251 +/- 229.8 micrograms/l to 45 +/- 29.3 micrograms/l, and they required parenteral iron supplementation. Significant side-effects occurring during long-term DFO administration were hypotension (11 patients), gastrointestinal upset (seven patients), porphyria cutaneous tarda-like lesions (three patients), and transient visual disturbance (one patient). There was a decrease in stainable bone aluminium in all nine patients with paired bone biopsy specimens (pre- and post-DFO).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We describe three such patients, each of whom presented with clinical hyperthyroidism and a diffuse goitre, without eye signs or dermatopathy. Two were receiving long-term phenothiazine, one of these was also acromegalic. Plasma thyroxine, free T4 and tri-iodothyronine were repeatedly raised in each; plasma TSH was grossly elevated in one and inappropriately normal in the other two. Plasma TSH did not rise in response to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone or metoclopramide and was not suppressed by L-dopa in any patient. Anti-thyrotrophin receptor antibodies were undetectable. Skull radiographs showed erosion and expansion of the pituitary fossa and CT scans confirmed a pituitary mass in each patient. A pituitary adenoma was removed by transphenoidal surgery in two patients and a TSH-secreting adenoma was confirmed by immunocytochemical staining and electron microscopy. Both patients were clinically euthyroid post-operatively but still had evidence of TSH excess. Pituitary surgery was technically unsuccessful in the third patient. Although two patients had hyperthyroidism of long duration, all three were diagnosed within one year of the introduction of a sensitive TSH assay to our laboratory. A TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma may be a more common cause of hyperthyroidism than has been believed.\r"

Clinical course, plasma oestradiol and progesterone levels, and urinary porphyrin and precursor excretion were monitored over a baseline period of approximately one year, and then for a similar period on buserelin treatment. There was a trend towards clinical improvement on buserelin therapy. The median number of attacks fell from seven during the baseline period to three on treatment (p = 0.06). The response to buserelin varied considerably, with those patients in whom the association between baseline attacks and the menstrual cycle was strongest gaining the most benefit. All patients became amenorrhoeic with suppression of plasma oestradiol and progesterone levels. Urinary delta-aminolaevulinic acid and total porphyrin excretion fluctuated widely both before and during treatment. Our experience indicates that ovulation suppression may be of value in the management of young women in whom recurrent attacks of porphyria are related to the menstrual cycle.\r"

These bacteria are remarkable in their ability to acquire and disseminate antibiotic resistance genes by a variety of routes. Since first described in 1979, high-level resistance to gentamicin (MIC, greater than 2,000 micrograms/mL) has spread worldwide and has been responsible for serious infections. Resistance is plasmid-mediated and due to aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. High-level gentamicin resistance indicates that there will be no synergistic bactericidal activity with penicillin-gentamicin combinations. The epidemiology of nosocomial enterococcal infections is remarkably similar to that of nosocomial infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli. The most likely way these resistant bacteria are spread among hospital patients is via transient carriage on the hands of hospital personnel. Patient-to-patient and interhospital transmission of strains has been reported recently. However, clonal dissemination is not the cause of the increased frequency of resistant strains, since gentamicin resistance appears in a variety of different conjugative and nonconjugative plasmids in Enterococcus.\r"

In this article, we overview the preclinical development of an antiretroviral drug, 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine; ddI), which has recently been shown in early phase I studies to have activity against human immunodeficiency virus in patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex.

Groups of three or four patients received intravenous dosages of 0.4 mg/(kg.d) to 25.6 mg/(kg.d) divided into two or three daily doses for 2 weeks, followed by oral ddI at twice the intravenous dosages. When given with antacids, ddI was well absorbed by the oral route and penetrated into the cerebrospinal fluid. The patients had an increase in mean number of CD4+ cells from 114/mm3 at entry to 161/mm3 at week 6 (P = .00004). They also had an increase in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and in total number of lymphocytes. Sixteen of 18 evaluable patients had a decrease in levels of human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen by week 6 (P = .0034). Many patients reported increased energy and appetite and gained weight. Dose-limiting toxicities at high dosages were painful peripheral neuropathy and sporadic pancreatitis. However, dosages up to 9.6 mg/(kg.d) have been tolerated in patients for 11-14 months. Thus, ddI has activity against human immunodeficiency virus at dosages that can be tolerated for approximately 1 year. However, life-threatening pancreatitis is a possible complication even at low dosages, and the best ways to manage and avoid adverse effects are still under study.\r"

Almost all patients had received zidovudine therapy previously. The maximal tolerated dosage of ddI was found to be approximately 12 mg/(kg.d) when it was administered orally for 28 weeks. The major dosage-limiting adverse effects encountered were neuropathy, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. These occurred at dosages higher than those associated with decreases in levels of p24 antigen. The major toxic effects of ddI are different from those associated with zidovudine. At the proper dosage, ddI may prove to be an effective agent for the chronic treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus and should be especially useful in the treatment of patients who cannot tolerate zidovudine.\r"

Thirteen of 18 patients previously treated with zidovudine had developed hematologic intolerance.

Other toxicities included elevation in hepatic transaminase levels, rash, cardiac conduction abnormality, and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Eighty-six percent of patients who completed 6 weeks of treatment showed improvement in constitutional symptoms and significant weight gain. In patients treated with ddI, the mean number of CD4+ lymphocytes increased from 124/mm3 at baseline to 199/mm3 at 24 weeks (P = .0027) and the mean leukocyte count, total lymphocyte count, and hemoglobin level showed increases (all P less than .01) after 12 weeks.

No differences between the responses of patients previously treated with zidovudine and those of zidovudine-naive patients were observed.

Potentially beneficial changes in weight (40% of patients), clinical signs or symptoms (40% of patients), CD4+ cell counts (25% of patients), and serum levels of HIV p24 antigen (50% of antigen-positive patients) were reported. Response rates tended to be higher among patients with AIDS-related complex and among those who had not received prior zidovudine therapy. A major response (improvement in at least one clinical parameter and in at least one laboratory marker) occurred in 29% of patients, and rates of major response tended to be higher in patients receiving higher dosages. The primary dose-limiting toxicity observed was peripheral neuropathy, which was observed with increasing frequency in patients receiving greater than 20 mg/(kg.d). Of the other adverse effects, pancreatitis was possibly dose-dependent and hyperuricemia (without clinical gout) occurred only at high doses. Dosages of 250 mg and 375 mg of ddI twice daily will be used in extended phase II/III studies.\r"

Ceftriaxone (a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg) is a simple, effective, and generally well-tolerated choice for uncomplicated N. gonorrhoeae infection at all anatomic sites. Alternatives include single-dose oral regimens of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and cefuroxime axetil as well as single-dose intramuscular regimens of spectinomycin, ceftizoxime, and cefotaxime. The addition of doxycycline (100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days) is recommended for presumptive treatment of chlamydial coinfection. Tetracyclines should not be used as sole therapy for gonococcal infection because of gonococcal resistance.\r"

Gamma interferon, interleukin 1-beta, interleukin 2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were assayed for in the urine of 4 patients treated with photodynamic therapy for bladder cancer, in 7 control patients undergoing transurethral surgical procedures, and in 5 healthy control subjects. Quantifiable concentrations of all cytokines, except gamma interferon, were measured in urine samples from the PDT patients with the highest light energies, while no urinary cytokines were found in the PDT patient who received the lowest light energy nor in any of the control subjects. These findings suggest that a local immunologic response may occur following PDT for bladder cancer.\r"

  ".U": "90350605\r", 
  ".W": "Trauma constitutes a significant portion of emergency department practice. Such patients often have suspected cervical spine injury necessitating cervical spine radiographs. The importance of detecting cervical spine injury is obvious because failure to do so can lead to tragic consequences for patient and physician alike. Although most cervical spine radiographs are justified, poorly indicated and unnecessary examinations are unfortunately commonplace. Indiscriminate ordering of cervical spine examinations can easily exceed radiology resources assigned to the emergency department. Rational ordering practices are therefore essential for efficient patient management. A risk-tailored approach to performing these examinations, which can improve efficiency, is presented. Once obtained, cervical spine radiographs are presumed to detect injury with consistently high sensitivity. Prevailing conditions of emergency department practice that may lower the \"sensitivity\" of cervical spine radiographs are reviewed. Overreliance on the initial radiologic examination may lead to inappropriate haste in the evaluation of suspected cervical region injury as exemplified by the commonly voiced mandate to \"clear the cervical spine\" of injury. This approach is discouraged in patients with significant trauma in favor of a careful, progressive evaluation of the potentially injured cervical spine. Periodic review of these complex issues and close cooperation between clinical services are emphasized.\r"

Detection of tumor, differential diagnosis of individual nodules, and mapping the anatomic extensions of malignant disease are now required routinely. Related and unrelated liver substrate abnormalities such as cavernous hemangioma and focal fatty deposits are often discovered in these patients and must be differentiated from metastatic deposits. Moreover, modern imaging methods frequently display tiny nodules (less than 1 cm) that often prove difficult to adequately characterize (micrometastases vs other kinds of lesions). The most sensitive imaging techniques are CT after arterial portography and intraoperative sonography, but because of their invasiveness, these are reserved exclusively for cancer staging. For primary screening, MR imaging is increasingly preferred over CT because of its superiority in discriminating hemangiomas and cysts from metastases without the need for iodinated contrast material.\r"

Cyst formation and/or hemorrhage appear as areas of high signal intensity (greater than that of fat) on T2-weighted images. Focal areas of low signal intensity (less than that of muscle) correspond pathologically to fibrous capsules and septa, air, or calcification. In this report, the MR appearance of the normal thymus is reviewed briefly, and the gamut of abnormal thymic masses on MR is illustrated.\r"

  ".W": "Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare, autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by CNS hemangioblastomas, retinal angiomas, renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, and visceral cysts. The occurrence of islet cell tumors in von Hippel-Lindau disease has been noted recently. Because of the coexistence of both islet cell tumors and pheochromocytomas in some patients with this disorder, it has been proposed that there may be a continuum of the multiple endocrine neoplasias. However, no large, multifamily study has been published evaluating the prevalence of islet cell tumors and pheochromocytomas in von Hippel-Lindau disease. To assess the frequency of islet cell tumors in this disorder and its relationship to the multiple endocrine neoplasias, we reviewed the clinical and imaging findings of all patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease evaluated at the Mayo Clinic between January 1979 and December 1989. Forty-three patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease from over 25 kindreds were found. Cross-sectional imaging of the pancreas had been performed in 35. Islet cell tumors were found in six (17%) of these, three islet cell adenomas and three islet cell carcinomas. No patient presented with endocrine-related symptoms; four tumors were detected during screening examinations of the abdomen. Two (33%) of these six patients had a coexisting pheochromocytoma. Our review of a large number of patients from many different families with von Hippel-Lindau disease revealed a high prevalence of islet cell tumors and the frequent coexistence of islet cell tumors and pheochromocytomas. This latter finding supports a continuum of the multiple endocrine neoplastic syndromes.\r"

Bleeding and seeding of malignant cells did not occur in any case. However, transient pain after injection of ethanol was more intense in these patients than in those whose lesions were not on the surface of the liver. Histopathologic examinations, imaging findings, and decrease in the serum alpha-fetoprotein levels showed that percutaneous ethanol injection was effective for tumors located on the surface of the liver. Our experience suggests that percutaneous ethanol injection can be performed safely even when lesions are located on the surface of the liver.\r"

To study its usefulness in these cases, we retrospectively reviewed the findings in 147 patients with abnormal portal venous color Doppler sonograms. This group comprised all patients with abnormal portal venous color Doppler sonograms studied from February 1987 to July 1989. Correlative imaging was not available in all cases. The sonographic diagnoses included (1) portal venous thrombosis (50 patients, 93 vessels); (2) portal-systemic or portal-portal collaterals (80 patients, 95 collaterals); (3) reversed, bidirectional, or other abnormal portal venous flow patterns (36 patients); and (4) abnormal hepatic arterial flow (20 patients). Since the results reported derive from a retrospective review without consistent correlation with other imaging studies, no appraisal of the sensitivity or accuracy of portal color Doppler sonography could be made from our data. The ability of color Doppler sonography to visualize flow without altering hemodynamics has led to several novel observations in these patients. These include increased arterial flow in states of low portal blood flow, reversal of portal flow direction postprandially, coincident reversed and hepatopetal flow in different branches of a single portal vein, and normal helical portal venous flow. These and other findings show that color Doppler sonography has enhanced our ability to detect abnormalities of the hepatic and portal venous system.\r"

The study population consisted of 89 consecutive patients, who received renal transplants 1 week to 17 years before our examination and underwent 96 core needle biopsies within 24 hr of sonography. The resistive index (RI), defined as the difference between the peak systolic and end diastolic flow velocities divided by the peak systolic velocity (expressed as a percentage), was measured in the main, segmental, interlobar, and arcuate renal arteries. Furthermore, the prominence of the renal pyramids, as determined by their size and echogenicity, was prospectively evaluated. Biopsy was used to establish diagnosis, but in cases of equivocal results, hospital course was the final arbiter. The most frequent diagnoses in the patients were acute rejection (41 patients) and chronic rejection (19 patients). Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis established that, regardless of the vessel in which it was measured, the use of RI to assign a diagnosis of acute rejection was no better than establishing this in a random manner. We did note, however, that patients with chronic rejection or cyclosporine toxicity were unlikely to have RIs greater than 80%. We further found that prominent pyramids were neither sensitive nor specific in the detection of acute rejection and that prominent pyramids were not correlated with elevated RI.\r"

  ".U": "90350622\r", 
  ".W": "Osteochondritis dissecans is a lesion of articular surfaces that is of uncertain etiology. These lesions are seen on radiographs as a bony defect or fragmentation of the subchondral bone. A bony defect may be an actual surface hole or the defect may be filled with fibrous tissue or fibrocartilage. Similarly, the apparent bone fragments may be only partially attached so they are unstable and prone to displacement or they may be firmly attached with fibrous tissue. Knowledge of fragment stability and the presence of an articular cartilage defect is useful in deciding on treatment. This information cannot be determined on plain films or clinical examination. We correlated MR examinations with arthroscopic findings in 21 patients with osteochondritis dissecans of the knee to see if MR imaging could be used to predict lesion stability and articular cartilage defects. A high-signal interface between the lesion and the femur was used as evidence of lesion instability and was found in 15 lesions. One of these lesions was questionably stable at surgery; the remainder were unstable and partially attached. The other six patients had displaced fragments with large articular defects that were clearly visualized on the MR examinations. We conclude that MR imaging is useful in evaluating articular surface defects and lesion stability in patients with osteochondritis dissecans.\r"

  ".W": "One technique for replacing the articular surface of the patella in total knee replacement is the use of a cementless porous-coated metal-backed polyethylene component. Anteroposterior, lateral, and Merchant or skyline radiographs in 10 cases of porous-coated metal-backed components that failed were evaluated for component alignment, component displacement, radiolucencies, loose beads, and integrity of the patellar component. Component failure was documented by surgery in all 10 cases. Seven cases of failure involved the patellar pegs or junction of the pegs with the metal backing and three cases involved the polyethylene portion. In the seven cases of peg-metal backing failure, three cases showed loose beads before failure and seven cases showed displacement of the metal backing at time of failure. All three cases of polyethylene failure showed narrowing or displacement of the polyethylene portion. Our experience shows that displacement of the metal backing, displacement of the polyethylene, and disruption of patellar pegs are seen in failed porous-coated metal-backed patellar components. Loose beads may be seen before peg-metal backing failure.\r"

Four had urinary tract infection. The fifth was noted to have hydronephrosis when CT scanning of the abdomen was done for trauma. In each case, voiding cystourethrography showed reflux into what was thought to be a single (nonduplex) collecting system, but was found during surgery to be the lower pole of a duplex system. Excretory urography in four patients, sonography in two, and CT scanning in one did not show signs of duplication on the affected side. In each case cystoscopy failed to show a duplex system on the affected side. The diagnosis of duplication of the collecting system with ectopic ureter or ureterocele was made in each case only when the bladder was opened to reimplant the ureter. Direct opacification of the previously unsuspected upper pole ureter in each case showed it to be bind-ending and terminating at the level of the kidney. Radiologists and surgeons should be aware that duplex systems may not always be visible on urography and sonography.\r"

The group included five people with acute idiopathic facial (Bell's) palsy, three with chronic idiopathic facial palsy, and one each with acute facial palsy after local radiation therapy, acute facial palsy resulting from herpes zoster virus infection, and facial palsy caused by facial neuroma. Eight of the 11 patients demonstrated marked enhancement of the affected facial nerve from the labyrinthine portion through the descending canal. Three patients also demonstrated mild enhancement of the distal canalicular portion of the facial nerve, simulating small distal acoustic neuromas. No difference in the pattern of enhancement between the acute or chronic Bell's palsy patients was seen. Radiographic resolution appeared to lag behind clinical resolution. The facial neuroma appeared distinct from the other lesions as a focally enhancing mass. The enhancement pattern in the Bell's group correlated with the histopathologic features of Bell's palsy and is consistent with the viral hypothesis of the syndrome. Thin-section contrast-enhanced MR scans are recommended for individuals with atypical presentation of facial paralysis. In the proper clinical setting, contrast-enhanced MR imaging may permit a positive radiographic diagnosis of Bell's palsy, which has previously been a diagnosis of exclusion.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-nine consecutive patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures were studied with electroencephalography and MR imaging to localize an epileptogenic focus for temporal lobectomy. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of pathologic findings after lobectomy: Group 1 comprised 13 patients with neoplasms, hamartomas, or cysts; group 2 comprised 13 patients with moderate and severe mesial temporal sclerosis (one patient was included in both groups 1 and 2); and group 3 comprised 14 patients who underwent aspiration lobectomy, which yielded limited tissue for pathologic study so no pathologic diagnosis was made. The majority of the patients in group 3 were assumed to have mesial temporal sclerosis. Abnormal MR signal in the temporal lobe on T2-weighted images was graded as minimal increase (1+), intermediate or moderate increase (2+), and very significant increase (3+). An abnormal signal was demonstrated in 26 (67%) of the 39 patients. In group 1, the tumor/cyst subgroup, an abnormal signal was seen in all 13 patients. Most had 3+ signal. There was increased signal in eight (62%) of 13 patients in group 2 and in six (43%) of 14 patients in group 3. This study suggests that MR can detect almost all tumors and a significant number of mesial temporal sclerosis lesions in individuals with complex partial seizures. On the basis of this small series, individuals who exhibit significant signal (3+) can be expected to have neoplasms, hamartomas, or cysts, and patients who exhibit minimal signal (1+) will usually have mesial temporal sclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-five pathologically proved cases of neonatal brain tumors (diagnosed in neonates within 60 days after birth) were reviewed from the neuroradiology archives dating back to 1964. CT was performed in 24 cases, MR in five, sonography in six, and angiography in seven. Two-thirds of the lesions were supratentorial. The most common histology was a tumor composed of primitive or poorly differentiated tissues: 12 teratomas and 12 primitive neuroectodermal tumors, four of which were typical medulloblastomas. In addition, there were nine astrocytomas (grades I-III); four cases of glioblastoma multiforme (astrocytoma grade IV); three choroid plexus papillomas; and single cases each of ependymoma, medulloepithelioma, germinoma, angioblastic meningioma, and ganglioglioma. The dominant CT appearance, regardless of histology, was a large heterogeneous lesion with associated hydrocephalus. Coarse calcification was a constant feature in the teratomas. Prognosis was poor overall, with the longest survival seen in choroid plexus papilloma and astrocytoma. Imaging studies are most valuable in identifying and distinguishing potentially curable lesions such as choroid plexus papillomas (variably sized intraventricular lesions with homogeneous enhancement) from rapidly fatal tumors such as teratomas (large heterogeneous lesions with coarse calcifications and associated hydrocephalus).\r"

  ".U": "90350629\r", 
  ".W": "Periventricular leukomalacia and germinal matrix hemorrhages are major causes of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the premature neonate. Although sonography is widely used to detect these abnormalities and is thought to be sensitive for hemorrhages and the later cystic stages of periventricular leukomalacia, its sensitivity for the more acute phase of periventricular leukomalacia remains to be determined. It has been difficult to study this issue because periventricular leukomalacia often is not lethal, and in postmortem studies there is usually a considerable interval between the time of in vivo imaging, if any, and the death of the patient. A \"prospective\" autopsy study was performed on brain specimens from infants who died at less than 1 year of age during a 10-month period. Thirty-five formalin-fixed brains were studied and sonographic images of these specimens were compared with histologic findings in whole brain sections to determine the sensitivity and specificity of sonography for the detection of germinal matrix hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia. Sonography identified germinal matrix hemorrhages as small as 5 mm, although smaller lesions were not visualized. Postmortem sonography had a sensitivity of 27% and specificity of 88% for all germinal matrix hemorrhages, but a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91% for hemorrhages larger than 5 mm. Periventricular leukomalacia, seen as hyperechoic areas in the periventricular white matter, was not detected as readily. For periventricular leukomalacia, the overall sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 87%, respectively. We conclude that sonography is useful for detecting the larger germinal matrix hemorrhages, but has more limited sensitivity in the early diagnosis of periventricular leukomalacia.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative spinal sonography (IOSS) with a 7.5-MHz sector transducer was performed in 30 patients with cervical spine injury associated with neurologic deficits. A laminectomy (25 patients) or anterior corpectomy (five patients) during spinal surgery provided the IOSS imaging window. The surgery was performed for either spinal decompression or fixation as part of the initial care of these patients and occurred 1 to 39 days (mean, 12.4 days) after injury. Parenchymal spinal cord lesions at the level of cervical fracture or stenosis that were compatible with the initial neurologic deficits were detected by IOSS in 28 (96.5%) of 29 patients with technically adequate studies. Lesions appeared as foci of increased echogenicity and were sorted into five injury grades (0 through IV). The IOSS injury grade in each patient was determined by the maximal diameter of regions of increased echogenicity and/or cyst formation in either the sagittal or transverse image plane. The extent of initial neurologic injury and its recovery was assessed by using the ASIA motor score (0 to 100 unit scale) at admission and during follow-up. The IOSS injury grade was correlated with the initial ASIA motor score (p less than 0.009, Spearman's Rank Order Test), indicating that the IOSS echogenicity is related to the extent of initial clinical motor deficit. Regression analysis disclosed that both the IOSS injury grade and the initial ASIA score were correlated with the follow-up ASIA score (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001, respectively). However, the the addition of IOSS injury grade to the initial ASIA motor score did not improve the predictive ability of the follow-up ASIA motor score. This was interpreted as indicating that the IOSS injury grade and initial ASIA motor score contain similar information about the extent of the traumatic spinal cord injury. IOSS was compared with concurrently performed cervical spine MR images in 12 patients. IOSS confirmed parenchymal lesions demonstrated by MR (five patients), revealed cord lesions not detected by suboptimal MR studies (three patients), and better characterized lesions with early cyst formation (two patients). IOSS did not detect possibly significant herniated intervertebral disks in two patients because of its limited field of view.\r"

Basal plasma ANF and cGMP were higher in heart-transplant recipients than in control patients, whereas PRA and plasma aldosterone did not differ. The high plasma ANF levels in heart-transplant recipients did not result from high atrial pressures but appeared to be related with elevated atrial dimensions and cyclosporine-induced renal failure. During volume expansion, plasma ANF increased in control patients and remained elevated during the postinfusion period. In heart-transplant recipients, the changes in plasma ANF were less marked despite identical increases of atrial pressures. The sluggish response of plasma ANF in this group was associated in the postinfusion period with a nonreturn of the hemodynamic parameters to their basal values in contrast with what was observed in control patients.\r"

  ".W": "Since the introduction of glyburide in 1984, many studies have evaluated the effects of this oral hypoglycemic agent on beta cell function in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The early studies, which were performed in patients receiving concomitant insulin therapy, may have underestimated the true effect of glyburide on insulin secretion. The more recent studies demonstrate that both short- and long-term glyburide therapy increase C-peptide levels in diabetic as well as nondiabetic subjects and that the effects of glyburide are comparable to those of the other second-generation sulfonylurea, glipizide. The effects of glyburide on insulin secretory rates calculated from plasma C-peptide levels were recently evaluated using individually derived C-peptide kinetic parameters and a validated open two-compartment model of peripheral C-peptide kinetics. Glyburide did not influence fasting insulin secretion (196 +/- 34 versus 216 +/- 23 pmol/min) but did cause an increase in the total amount of insulin secreted over a 24-hour period (447 +/- 58 versus 561 +/- 55 nmol). This increase in the production of insulin was generated by an increase in amplitude of secretory pulses occurring after lunch and dinner rather than by a greater number of pulses. The full effect of glyburide on the beta cell became evident when glucose concentrations were clamped at the hyperglycemic level of 300 mg/dL both before and during treatment for a 3-hour period. During that time, insulin secretion rates increased by 221 percent in response to glyburide. Glyburide did not, however, completely reverse the beta cell secretory defect characteristic of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In the patients receiving glyburide, the sluggish insulin secretory response to breakfast persisted, and the insulin secretory response during the hyperglycemic clamping was less than the response normally seen in nondiabetic subjects. These experiments suggest that the primary effect of glyburide on the beta cell is to increase its responsiveness to glucose. Although the precise mechanism of action of glyburide at the cellular level is unclear, in vitro studies suggest that its effect is mediated through binding with specific receptors on the beta cell membrane, which in turn leads to alterations in the cellular efflux of potassium ions and influx of calcium ions.\r"

Insulin resistance is the key in this process because of the inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production, thereby allowing an unopposed glucagon effect. Glyburide, one of the second-generation sulfonylureas, decreases glucose production and enhances insulin action in the liver. Available data suggest that glyburide: (1) enhances glycogen synthesis in the liver by increasing glycogen synthase; (2) inhibits glycogenolysis by decreasing phosphorylase alpha activity; and (3) decreases gluconeogenesis and stimulates glycolysis by decreasing A-kinase activity, which results in increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, one of the key regulators of carbohydrate metabolism in the liver. The effect of glyburide on the insulin-signaling mechanism(s) is distal to the insulin binding site of the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor and the tyrosine kinase activation site of the beta-subunit.\r"

  ".W": "Glyburide, along with the other second-generation oral hypoglycemic agent glipizide, has been used as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. After glyburide therapy, basal glycemia and glucose response to a meal are greatly improved. The mechanism for the glucose-lowering effect of the drug remains controversial. Glyburide is generally thought to exert two major actions: stimulation of pancreatic insulin secretion and enhancement of insulin action in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. Studies in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus indicate that the action of glyburide on the liver plays a central role in decreasing glucose. With short-term therapy, glyburide decreases hepatic glucose production by elevating pancreatic insulin secretion. However, this increase in pancreatic insulin secretion is not sustained as therapy is continued, suggesting that glyburide then acts directly on the liver. The mechanism for the improvement in hepatic glucose metabolism after long-term treatment is not known. In vitro, glyburide has been shown to inhibit gluconeogenesis as well as glycogenolysis and to enhance hepatic glucose uptake, thus providing possible explanations for the action of the drug on the liver.\r"

  ".W": "A high-affinity sulfonylurea receptor has been identified on the plasma membrane of the beta cell. The potent second-generation sulfonylureas, glyburide and glipizide, saturate the receptor in the low nM concentration range, whereas first-generation drugs bind to and saturate the receptor in the microM range. For each of the sulfonylureas, there is excellent quantitative agreement among the equilibrium binding constant (Kd), the half-maximal inhibition of potassium ion (K+) efflux (K0.5), and the half-maximal stimulation of insulin secretion (ED50), when these values are obtained from insulin-secreting cell lines or from isolated mouse pancreatic islets. The inhibition of K+ efflux by the sulfonylureas, coupled with the sulfonylurea inhibition of the activity of a specific adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channel embedded in the plasma membrane of whole cells or in excised membrane patches, suggests that the sulfonylurea receptor is this channel protein or a closely associated subunit. The activity of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel is also controlled by the insulin secretagogues, glucose and certain amino acids. These compounds must be metabolized to inhibit the channel activity and appear to do so by increasing the level of ATP or by increasing the ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio. ATP reduces channel activity by binding to a specific nucleotide-binding site on the cytoplasmic surface of the protein. There is a synergy between the action of glucose and that of the sulfonylureas. The sulfonylureas, for example, are better effectors of insulin secretion in the presence of glucose. Inhibition of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels results in depolarization of the plasma membrane and a subsequent influx of extracellular calcium ions through voltage-dependent calcium channels. An increase in the free intracellular calcium level is the signal, or \"second messenger,\" that triggers exocytosis and the release of insulin. The sulfonylurea receptor has a molecular weight of 140,000 and can be solubilized by digitonin, retaining the same rank order of sulfonylurea binding affinities as the membrane-bound protein. Several laboratories are currently purifying the receptor and/or cloning the receptor gene.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of glyburide on peripheral (muscle) and hepatic insulin sensitivity in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as well as in healthy control subjects. In protocol 1, 10 patients with NIDDM and seven young healthy control subjects were studied. Changes in insulin sensitivity (40 mU/m2.min euglycemic insulin clamp), hepatic glucose production (3-[3H]glucose turnover), and insulin secretion (+125 mg/dL hyperglycemic clamp) were measured before and after 3 months (in patients with NIDDM) and 6 weeks (in young control subjects) of glyburide therapy. In protocol 2, five patients with IDDM and eight patients with insulin-treated NIDDM were evaluated before and after two months of glyburide therapy (20 mg per day). Changes in daily insulin requirements, 24-hour plasma glucose profiles, glycohemoglobin, glucagon-stimulated C-peptide secretion, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic glucose production were measured. In protocol 1, glyburide significantly improved insulin sensitivity (p less than 0.01) and insulin secretion (p less than 0.01) in the NIDDM patients. The elevated rates of hepatic glucose production (2.4 +/- 0.3 mg/kg.min) were reduced after glyburide therapy (1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/kg.min; p less than 0.01) and were highly correlated with an improvement in fasted plasma glucose levels (r = 0.92; p less than 0.001). Insulin sensitivity also improved in the young healthy control subjects after glyburide therapy (6.5 +/- 0.5 to 7.6 +/- 0.7 mg/kg.min; p less than 0.05). In protocol 2, glyburide treatment produced no change in daily insulin requirement (54 +/- 8 versus 53 +/- 7 units per day), mean 24-hour glucose levels (177 +/- 20 versus 174 +/- 29 mg/dL), glycohemoglobin (10.1 +/- 1.0 percent versus 9.5 +/- 7 percent), C-peptide secretion, insulin sensitivity, or basal hepatic glucose production (p values not significant) in the IDDM patients. In contrast, the insulin-treated NIDDM patients had significant reductions in mean daily insulin requirement (72 +/- 6 versus 58 +/- 9 units per day; p = 0.05), mean 24-hour plasma glucose levels (153 +/- 10 to 131 +/- 5 mg/dL; p less than 0.05), and glycohemoglobin levels (10.3 +/- 0.7 percent to 8.0 +/- 0.4 percent; p less than 0.05) and an improvement in C-peptide secretion (0.24 +/- 0.07 to 0.44 +/- 0.09 pmol/mL; p = 0.08). Stimulated C-peptide levels were highly correlated with a reduction in insulin dose observed during the 2-month treatment period (r = 0.93; p less than 0.001). Insulin sensitivity improved slightly but not significantly after glyburide treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Gel-filtration chromatography was used to identify the presence of excess tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase as the major collagenase inhibitor in the extracellular matrix of human placentas. After the onset of labor, there was a significant increase in total collagenase activity. Inactivation of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase by reduction of placental extracts with dithiothreitol and alkylation with iodoacetamide resulted in a twelvefold to seventeenfold increase in collagenase activity. Umbilical cord collagenase levels were significantly lower than those in maternal circulation. The possibility of circulating collagenase originating from placenta in labor is discussed.\r"

Forty-five of 47 patients (96%) had a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, ranging from 46 to 150 seconds. Elevated levels of IgG antiphosphatidylserine antibodies and IgM antiphosphatidylserine antibodies were present in 41 (87%) and in 19 (40%) of samples, respectively. Antibodies against cardiolipin were less commonly observed; IgG anticardiolipin antibodies in only 32 (68%) of 47 samples and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies in 15 (36%) of 42 samples. Neither the level of IgG antiphosphatidylserine antibodies nor the level of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies correlated well with the degree of prolongation of coagulation in the activated partial thromboplastin time (R = 0.312, p = 0.032 for IgG antiphosphatidylserine antibodies versus activated partial thromboplastin time; R = 0.251, p = 0.088 for IgG anticardiolipin antibodies versus activated partial thromboplastin time). Concordance with the activated partial thromboplastin time, however, was observed in 41 (87%) samples for IgG antiphosphatidylserine antibodies and in only 32 (68%) samples for IgG anticardiolipin antibodies. Our conclusion is that the antiphosphatidylserine assay correlates best, although not totally, with the presence of lupus anticoagulant and that the antiphosphatidylserine assay is more sensitive than testing for anticardiolipin.\r"

Pregnant does received thyrotropin-releasing hormone (5, 10, or 50 micrograms/kg every 12 hours for four doses or one dose of 20 micrograms/kg) in conjunction with betamethasone beginning on day 25 of gestation, with betamethasone alone or saline solution used as comparison treatment groups. Half of the newborn rabbits received supplemental surfactant therapy after delivery on day 27, and all were ventilated on a ventilator plethysmography system for 30 minutes. There were no differences among the four thyrotropin-releasing hormone doses in surfactant pool sizes, compliances, or proteins leak into or out of the air spaces. The groups that received multiple doses of thyrotropin-releasing hormone had significantly higher perinatal loss rates than the single-dose group. The lungs of the group treated with thyrotropin-releasing hormone plus steroid and the rabbits treated only with steroid were more compliant than the controls without surfactant therapy, and showed significant improvements in protein leak. The addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to betamethasone improved several of the protein leak measurements compared with use of betamethasone alone. These results question the necessity of multiple doses of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to induce pulmonary maturation, especially when the higher perinatal mortality and the theoretical long-term effects of fetal hyperthyroidism on thyroid axis function are considered.\r"

We found that antibodies to recombinantly expressed APP labeled many normal neurons and neurites. In addition, dystrophic neurites in different types of senile plaques and degenerating neurons in the temporal cortex and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease patients were immunostained. We also detected small clusters of dystrophic APP immunoreactive neurites that were not associated with beta-amyloid protein deposits. Microglia was involved in different types of senile plaques and often were associated closely with APP immunoreactive neurites and neurons. The greatest concurrence of APP immunoreactivity and reactive microglia was seen in the subiculum and area CA1, regions with a high density of congophilic plaques and subject to intense Alzheimer's pathology. Our findings suggest that neuronally derived APP is the source for senile plaque beta-amyloid protein, while microglia may act as processing cells.\r"

  ".U": "90350795\r", 
  ".W": "One of the major host-defense functions of alveolar macrophages is the phagocytosis and clearance of inhaled particles deposited in the lower airways and alveolar spaces. Recent studies have indicated that the condensed tannins present in cotton mill dust stimulate the secretion of neutrophil chemotactic factor and arachidonic acid from resident rabbit alveolar macrophages and that these responses may contribute to the acute pulmonary inflammatory reaction associated with byssinosis. To characterize further the effect of tannin on macrophage function, the ability of tannin to modulate alveolar macrophage spreading and phagocytosis in vitro was examined. Tannin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of alveolar macrophage spreading with nearly complete inhibition occurring at concentrations of 12.5 micrograms/ml. This inhibitory effect of tannin was not reversed with removal of tannin. Furthermore addition of tannin to previously spread macrophages actively caused the macrophages to round up. Examination of the structure of alveolar macrophages exposed to tannin by scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed blebs on the surface of the cells and the loss of most of the cellular organelle structure, as compared to control macrophages. Tannin also modulated the ability of the alveolar macrophages to phagocytize unopsonized latex microspheres. The effect of tannin was biphasic. At the lowest concentration examined (3 micrograms/ml), tannin significantly enhanced phagocytosis of the latex microspheres. However, as the concentration was increased, phagocytosis decreased almost exponentially until at 50 micrograms/ml phagocytosis was significantly inhibited compared to control macrophages. These data indicate that tannin present in inhaled cotton mill dust could significantly decrease the ability of resident alveolar macrophages to phagocytize and thereby clear inhaled dust particles. This inhibitory effect would increase the time that particles remain exposed in the lower airway and alveolar spaces and thereby increase the time that potentially toxic compounds in the dust have to exert their biologic effect. This inhibition of macrophage function may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of byssinosis.\r"

The authors also compared studies of the serotonergic agents fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine, and clomipramine and found that a greater effect size was associated with less serotonergic specificity and that some ability to affect other neurotransmitter systems may be a necessary but not sufficient requirement for antiobsessional activity.

PATIENTS: One hundred and eighteen patients with severe aplastic anemia, including 19 with hepatitis-associated aplasia, 61 with aplastic anemia of undetermined cause, and 38 with aplastic anemia related to an inherited syndrome or an acquired etiology. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in antihepatitis C virus antibodies between hepatitis-related aplastic anemia (15.8%; 95% CI, 4% to 36%) and aplasia of unknown (9.8%; CI, 5% to 22%) or known (7.9%; CI, 2% to 22%) cause. The antihepatitis C virus levels did not differ according to the cause of aplastic anemia. There was no relation between hepatitis C and hepatitis B virus serologies, regardless of cause. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is not a frequent cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Either a non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis virus is involved in non-A, non-B hepatitis-related aplasia or hepatitis C virus prevalence is underestimated in patients with hepatitis-related aplasia, possibly as a result of immunologic defects.\r"

We compared the microdilution MICs and MBCs of this compound to those of other antimicrobial agents for more than 30 clinical isolates of each of these groups of organisms and found that with few exceptions, it was at least 10 times more active than all other drugs tested. Selection for resistance to ciprofloxacin (greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/ml) or WIN 57273 (greater than or equal to 0.16 microgram/ml) by the gradient plate method produced mutants with diminished susceptibility to the other fluoroquinolone; however, the MICs and MBCs of WIN 57273 for such strains were still quite low and remained below the preliminary susceptibility breakpoint (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Spontaneous mutations conferring resistance to two and five times the WIN 57273 MIC were detectable at low frequencies for S. aureus and S. epidermidis; such mutations were virtually undetectable for E. faecalis. Further testing is necessary to establish if the effectiveness of WIN 57273 is maintained in vivo, first in animals and then in humans with infections caused by methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis or gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant strains of E. faecalis.\r"

A dose of 10(7) organisms was given orally 2 days after irradiation, and therapy was started 1 day later. Only 4 of 20 untreated mice (20%) survived for at least 30 days compared with 19 of 20 mice (95%) treated with ofloxacin (P less than 0.005). P. aeruginosa was isolated from the livers of 21 to 28 untreated mice (75%), compared with only 2 of 30 treated mice (P less than 0.005). Ofloxacin reduced colonization of the ileum by P. aeruginosa; 24 of 28 untreated mice (86%) harbored the organisms, compared with only 5 of 30 (17%) with ofloxacin (P less than 0.005). This experiment was replicated twice, and similar results were obtained.

All had raised intrapulmonary shunts (mean 25.6%, range 5.4-50%, normal less than 5%). Two had a high alveolar dead space, and two had unsuspected congenital heart disease. Epoprostenol (prostacyclin), but not 100% oxygen, caused a significant fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. Death was associated with a high pulmonary vascular resistance and a high shunt. Morphometric studies in three cases showed normal numbers of airways, but increased thickness of bronchial muscle. The numbers of alveoli were reduced and the walls thickened. There was increased medial thickness in small pulmonary arteries with distal extension of muscle. In the oldest child some vessels were obliterated by fibrosis. We speculate that measurements of pulmonary vascular resistance and shunt may have prognostic value; that a trial of pulmonary vasodilators other than oxygen might be worthwhile in patients with poor prognosis; and that abnormalities of the pulmonary circulation contribute to the difficulties of managing patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

Abnormalities were detected in six (60%) cases with mitral valve involvement in five patients and aortic valve disease in four. One patient had severe mitral leaflet thickening to the point of mitral stenosis. Two patients had evidence for myocardial involvement by way of echocardiographic ventricular hypertrophy. The cardiac lesions were haemodynamically mild. A cardiac murmur was audible in only three of the six cases. It is concluded that there is a high prevalence of silent cardiac abnormalities in patients with Morquio's syndrome with predominantly left sided valve involvement. Echocardiography should be part of the assessment of these patients and bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis should be advised for those with cardiac abnormalities.\r"

This diagnosis, which was suspected because of ultrasound findings of discordant growth, discordant amniotic fluid volumes, concordant external genitalia, and monochorial placentation, was confirmed postnatally in each. Nine fetuses underwent blood sampling to aid diagnosis and assessment of fetal wellbeing. In contrast to fetofetal transfusion syndrome investigated postnatally, a difference in haemoglobin concentration of 50 g/l or more in utero was found in only one pregnancy, which was near term, although all had fetal erythroblastaemia and a difference in weight of 20% or more. In vivo confirmation of shared circulation was achieved in two pregnancies by transfusing adult Rh negative red cells into the smaller fetus and then detecting them by Kleihauer testing in blood aspirated from the larger. Invasive procedures also yielded information on fetal blood gas measurements (acidaemia in four and hypoxaemia in six) and amniotic pressure (raised in two). We suggest that comparison of haemoglobin concentrations is inaccurate in fetofetal transfusion syndrome in utero, the diagnosis of which may necessitate detection of a shared circulation using a marker such as adult red cells.\r"

A possible disadvantage is compromise of the infant's cardiovascular condition secondary to inadvertent positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). In a group of 20 such infants treated with high frequency positive pressure ventilation (rates of up to 100/minute) and analysed, changes in arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity were largely influenced by changes in arterial blood gases, and no effect could be attributed to inadvertent PEEP. In addition, the observed fall in both arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions could be readily predicted for theoretical reasons. Under certain conditions at the fastest rates used, cerebral blood flow velocity was significantly influenced by changes in blood pressure, which may indicate impaired cerebrovascular regulation. Though other factors (such as the severity of the infants' illness or the use of paralysis) may have been responsible for this apparent blood pressure passivity, the role of high frequency positive pressure ventilation in such infants warrants further study.\r"

Eight fetuses had ultrasonographic evidence of severe hydrops fetalis and an additional three fetuses had mild hydrops. Severely hydropic fetuses were more anaemic and immature than those with mild or no hydrops. Among fetuses from which samples were taken before in utero transfusion, concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were higher in those with severe hydrops than in the other groups. An inverse relationship between the haemoglobin concentration and that of atrial natriuretic factor was found. In four fetuses in which severe hydrops resolved after intravascular transfusions in utero, there were significant decreases in plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentrations; in the fifth fetus the decrease was less pronounced. Raised concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor in fetuses with severe anaemia and hydrops may be the result of atrial natriuretic factor release induced by hypoxia.\r"

The solutions were isocaloric (1.6 MJ/l, 380 kcal/l) and with the same nitrogen content (2.79 g/l) and were infused at rates and volumes determined by clinical staff on the basis on the infants, clinical condition and serum electrolyte biochemistry. There was an excess of deaths in the group treated with Vamin 9 glucose particularly related to babies weighing greater than or equal to 1000 g. Infants less than 1000 g receiving the Vamin 9 glucose preparation required amino acids for twice as long. There was no significant difference between the weight losses or head circumference during the study period. Plasma aminograms in the group receiving Vamin 9 glucose showed concentrations of phenylalanine, tyrosine, proline, serine, and aspartic acid to be significantly higher than the reference range. Multiple regression analysis suggested that phenylalanine was the primary abnormality. The intravenous amino acid preparation MB233G maintained the plasma aminogram of newborn infants within the reference range of normal newborn infants.\r"

We observed a characteristic pattern of response to primary HIV infection; initial lymphopenia was followed by CD8 lymphocytosis and inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio. During follow-up, the CD8 count gradually returned to normal, whereas the CD4:CD8 ratio remained inverted because of a relatively low number of CD4 lymphocytes. Primary infection was followed by prolonged and severe cellular hyporesponsiveness to both mitogens and antigen. At the last follow-up, responses to pokeweed mitogen were still severely impaired, with a median 19% (range 7-50%) of that observed in healthy controls.

  ".W": "Fourteen days' culture of human spleen cells with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) or T-cell growth factor (TCGF) results in the generation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) effector cells that have the unique property of lysing natural killer (NK)-resistant human tumor cells, Daudi, and NK-sensitive K562 cells. LAK cells were generated from patients with advanced cancer or liver cirrhosis. The splenic LAK-effector cell types were analyzed by two-color flow cytometry. The rIL-2-induced LAK cells showed an increased proportion of CD8+CD11- and CD57+CD16- and a decreased proportion of CD4+Leu-8- cells. In contrast, TCGF-induced LAK cells revealed a significantly increased proportion of CD8+CD11- and CD4+Leu-8- cells and a decreased proportion of CD57+CD16- cells. Thus, splenic LAK cells with different surface phenotypes were induced by the cultivation with rIL-2 or TCGF. Furthermore, TCGF-induced LAK cell activities in patients with cancer were found to be lower than the rIL-2-induced LAK cell activities. It was noted that the TCGF-activated splenic lymphoid cells did not inhibit the effector process of tumor cell lysis by LAK cells that had been activated by rIL-2. Other mechanisms of lower LAK cell activities of TCGF-activated splenic lymphoid cells from patients with cancer were discussed. The findings suggest that spleens of examined patients with gastric or hepatocellular carcinoma do not seem to be responsible for suppression of cell-mediated antitumor immunity.\r"

  ".W": "In 12 patients with unilateral significant renal ischemia plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were estimated in renal vein blood of the ischemic (IK) and contralateral kidney (NK) and in arterial blood under supine and upright conditions. Plasma ANP levels in renal vein blood were compared with plasma renin activity (PRA) of the same blood samples. Plasma ANP levels in renal vein blood of the contralateral kidney (87 +/- 9 pg/ml) were significantly lower than in arterial blood (131 +/- 11 pg/ml) and renal vein blood of the ischemic kidney (139 +/- 16 pg/ml). In contrast plasma ANP concentrations in renal vein blood of the ischemic kidney were slightly or markedly higher than in arterial blood. A positive correlation was found between the ratio of plasma ANP in renal vein blood of the IK to that of the NK under supine condition and the respective ratio of PRA. Data presented in this paper suggest the presence of abnormal handling of ANP by an ischemic kidney and that plasma ANP levels in renal vein blood may be a marker of renal ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "A somatomammotropic cell line (P0) derived from adult rat pituitaries has been maintained in culture for 2 yr. Secretion of GH and PRL by this cell line has been studied in response to hypophysiotropic peptides known to affect the release of both hormones as well as agents that affect second messenger systems in an attempt to characterize the stimulus-secretion mechanisms used by these cells. GH and PRL release during short term (4 h) incubations of P0 cells and primary cultures of dispersed rat pituitary cells was initially measured in response to GRF, TRH, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and SRIF. In P0 cells, the minimal effective dose of each of the hypophysiotropic peptides was comparable with respect to GH and PRL secretion. The effects of TRH and VIP were similar to those in freshly dispersed cells with respect to PRL release, whereas those of GRF and SRIF were less potent with respect to GH release. The stimulation of GH and PRL release in P0 cells by adenylate cyclase-related agents ((Bu)2 cAMP and forskolin) was comparable to that for GH secretion in mature somatotrophs but much greater than that of PRL release in mature lactotrophs. Stimulation of GH and PRL release in P0 cells by protein kinase C-related agents (diacylglycerol and phorbol ester) was also similar to that observed for GH release from mature pituitary cells, whereas minimal or undetectable effects were observed on PRL release from mature cells. The results indicate that the P0 somatomammotropic cell line possesses receptors, second messenger systems, and secretory characteristics of both somatotrophs and lactotrophs, although where differences exist, there is more resemblance to somatotrophs. They also demonstrate that the responses to each of the agents studied are bihormonal and appear to be regulated by a common mechanism.\r"

Push-pull perfusion (PPP) of the mediobasal (MBH) or anterior (AH) regions of the hypothalamus was performed on conscious, unrestrained does for 3 h before and 5 h after exposure to a vasectomized buck. In experiment 1, GnRH concentrations were measured by RIA in 20-min fractions of MBH-PPP. An approximately 100-fold increase in GnRH release was observed within 1 h of coitus (pre, 1.15 +/- 0.29 pg/ml; peak, 106.67 +/- 37.42 pg/ml; n = 6; P less than 0.05). Concomitant surges of LH and PRL in the peripheral circulation were observed. In experiment 2, GnRH and norepinephrine (NE) were measured (the latter by radioenzymatic assay) in 10-min fractions of MBH-PPP. A 218% postcoital rise in NE levels (n = 5; P less than 0.05) in MBH-PPP accompanied an approximately 50-fold peak rise in GnRH in the same samples (pre, 1.57 +/- 0.23 pg/ml; peak, 76.52 +/- 50.14 pg/ml; P less than 0.05). MBH-NE, MBH-GnRH, LH, and PRL release began rising within 10 min of coitus. In experiment 3, GnRH was measured in 20 min fractions of AH-PPP. Coitus induced a marked rise in AH-GnRH release (precoitus, 0.31 +/- 0.03 pg/ml; peak, 2.25 +/- 0.80 pg/ml; n = 4; P less than 0.05) which differed from coitus-induced MBH-GnRH release both quantitatively (i.e. approximately 7-fold increase for AH vs. approximately 50-100-fold increase for MBH; 50-min lag time for AH vs. less than 20 min for MBH) and qualitatively (i.e. AH-GnRH release was discontinuous, while MBH-GnRH release rose sharply, plateaued, and then declined slowly over the 2-5 h following coitus). No changes in MBH-NE, MBH-GnRH, AH-GnRH, LH, FSH, or PRL were observed in sham-mated does (Exp 1, n = 7; Exp 2, n = 3; Exp 3, n = 4). These data support the hypotheses that: 1) hypothalamic GnRH release is a component of reflexive ovulation in the rabbit; 2) increased hypothalamic noradrenergic tone is related to the surge-release of GnRH; and 3) AH-GnRH release is enhanced following coitus.\r"

  ".W": "To gain a better understanding of the luteotropic action of estrogen, we have investigated the effect of estrogen on the synthesis of the enzyme, cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc) in the rabbit corpus luteum. Using an established protocol, rabbits were treated with estradiol, and the estradiol was then withdrawn on day 9 of pseudopregnancy, which caused an 88% fall in serum progesterone within 48 h. In other rabbits, estradiol was replaced at 48 h which stimulated a 6.6-fold increase in serum progesterone concentration within the next 24 h. Luteal tissues were incubated with [35S]methionine and homogenized, and a mitochondrial fraction lysate was obtained. Equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was taken for immunoprecipitation using a well-characterized polyclonal antiserum against bovine adrenal P-450scc. The immunoisolated proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radioactivity was visualized by autofluorography. The results indicate that the rate of synthesis of P-450scc in 48 h-estradiol withdrawn animals was markedly reduced, and by 72 h of withdrawal was barely detectable. When estradiol was reintroduced, the synthesis of P-450scc was increased. Despite the prominent changes in P-450scc synthesis, immunoblotting revealed only a minimal (approximately 30%) decrease in relative P-450scc content by 72 h after estradiol withdrawal. Analyses of DNA and protein contents of luteal tissues revealed an increase in DNA per mg luteal tissue, a decline in total tissue protein/DNA ratio, but no change in mitochondrial fraction protein/DNA ratio after estrogen withdrawal. The results indicate that de novo synthesis of P-450scc in the corpus luteum is sensitive to estrogen; however, the estrogen-sensitive rate-limiting step(s) for steroidogenesis are at other sites in the steroid biosynthetic pathway.\r"

Saturation studies of solubilized material revealed a high affinity binding site, with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 181 +/- 45 pM. Binding was reversible and inhibited by melatonin and closely related analogs, but not by serotonin or norepinephrine. Treatment of solubilized material with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, guanosine 5'-(3-O-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S), significantly reduced receptor affinity. Gel filtration chromatography of solubilized melatonin receptors revealed a high affinity, large (Mr 400,000) peak of specific binding. Pretreatment with GTP-gamma-S before solubilization resulted in elution of a lower affinity, smaller (Mr 150,000) peak of specific binding. To purify solubilized receptors, a novel affinity chromatography resin was developed by coupling 6-hydroxymelatonin with Epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B. Using this resin, melatonin receptors were purified approximately 10,000-fold. Purified material retained the pharmacologic specificity of melatonin receptors. These results show that melatonin receptors that bind ligand after detergent treatment can be solubilized and substantially purified by affinity chromatography.\r"

Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were given testosterone by Silastic implants, which either inhibited (3-cm length) or partially maintained (10 cm) spermatogenesis over a 13-week period. The numbers of nuclei of the various germ cell categories (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids) in the testes were estimated by profile counting and measurement of nuclear diameter. The numbers of elongated spermatids were determined separately in testicular homogenates. Testis weight, seminiferous tubule volume, and tubule diameter were significantly decreased in intact rats with 3- and 10-cm testosterone implants and in HPX rats, although they were partially maintained in groups with 10-cm implants compared to those in groups with 3-cm implants (P less than 0.05). The effect of 3-cm testosterone implants in the intact group was to suppress the number of spermatogonia to 57%, reduce the conversion of spermatogonia to spermatocytes to 85%, and reduce the conversion of round to elongated spermatids to 19% of the control value. This latter effect was largely overcome with 10-cm testosterone implants. In HPX rats, only 10-cm implants were effective in maintaining the conversion of round spermatids to elongated spermatids. However, testosterone alone was less effective in maintaining the conversion of spermatocytes to round spermatids, suggesting that a pituitary factor, probably FSH, was involved. It is concluded that testosterone has a major effect on the conversion of round to elongated spermatids. The conversion of spermatogonia to spermatocytes and the conversion of spermatocytes to round spermatids depend on the synergistic action of both FSH and testosterone. However, the effect of FSH is greatest on the conversion of spermatocytes to spermatids, i.e. meiosis.\r"

  ".W": "Using monolayer cultures from murine brain and reaggregate cell cultures of rat anterior pituitary we observed that TRH (pyroGlu-His-Pro-NH2) added to the culture medium was not taken up by these cells but hydrolyzed at the pyroGlu-His bond by an enzyme obviously located at the cell surface. This enzyme exhibited a high degree of substrate specificity and other characteristics of the membrane-bound TRH-degrading enzyme. Relatively high enzymatic activity was associated with cultured neuronal cells from embryonic rat brain while glial cells were almost devoid of this peptidase activity. Rather low, but significant activity was found on anterior pituitary cell aggregates. In agreement with previous in vivo studies we observed that the TRH-degrading ectoenzyme on adenohypophyseal cells was regulated by estradiol and stringently controlled by T3, but that the activity of the brain enzyme was not. When pituitary cells were separated according to their size and density and established in reaggregate cell culture, a close correlation was always observed between enzyme activity and the distribution of lactotrophic cells regardless of the animal models (eu- and hypothyroid adult male rats) used and the cell fractionation techniques (velocity sedimentation and sequential velocity/buoyant density sedimentation) employed. Such a close correlation was not observed with other cell types, such as the somatotrophic cells, the folliculo-stellate cells, the ACTH-producing AtT20 pituitary cells, or thyrotrophic cells. In conclusion, the high degree of substrate specificity, the tissue-specific regulation, and the very heterogeneous distribution of the TRH-degrading ectoenzyme on brain and pituitary cells strongly support the hypothesis that this enzyme serves very specialized functions in the transmission of TRH signals at specific target sites.\r"

  ".W": "TSH desensitization involves decreased coupling of the TSH receptor to the adenylate cyclase regulatory protein, Gs. There is evidence that a desensitization protein in thyroid cells plays a role in this process. The molecular cloning of the human TSH receptor and its stable expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-TSHR) cells allowed us to test whether or not TSH desensitization can occur in a nonthyroidal cell. Similar to human thyroid cells, maximal stimulation of cAMP levels in CHO-TSHR cells was attained after 30-60 min of exposure to bovine TSH. Unlike in human thyroid cells, however, preincubation of CHO-TSHR cells with TSH for 12-16 h did not decrease the subsequent cAMP response to a 1-h pulse of TSH stimulation. That is, the human TSH receptor in CHO-TSHR cells does not undergo functional desensitization. Scatchard plot analysis of specific TSH binding to the CHO-TSHR cells revealed high and low affinity sites (Ka of 1.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(9) M-1 and 1.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(7) M-1, respectively), with approximately 10(5) TSH receptors per cell. This is 10- to 100-fold greater than the number of TSH receptors estimated to be present on human thyroid cells. Untransfected CHO cells exhibited only the low affinity binding site. Prior exposure of CHO-TSHR cells to bovine TSH or to (Bu)2cAMP for periods up to 24 h did not reduce [125I]TSH binding to these cells. In summary, desensitization of the adenylate cyclase response to TSH stimulation does not occur in nonthyroidal cells expressing a human TSH receptor with normal functional and TSH binding characteristics. These data support the concept that a cell-specific protein may be involved in homologous TSH desensitization.\r"

  ".W": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, primarily of the MHC class II region, are linked to increased susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease in animals and humans. The quantity of MHC class II antigens that are expressed on the appropriate cell surface, as well as their allotype, are of vital importance to immune function. We have, therefore, compared MHC class II (RT1.D) gene activation in a newly available Wistar rat thyroid (WRT) cell line (a thyroiditis-susceptible strain) with a cloned cell (1B-6) derived from the Fisher rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5) (a thyroiditis-resistant strain) to determine differences in their degree of MHC class II gene activation and antigen expression. There was no detectable constitutive MHC class II antigen or RT1.D alpha-chain messenger RNA expression in either WRT or 1B-6 cells. Cultures of both cells expressed MHC class II gene induction in response to recombinant rat gamma-interferon (gamma IF). After 72 h of exposure to 25 U/ml gamma IF, over 80% of WRT cells expressed class II antigen, detected by flow cytometric assessment, as compared to only 15% of 1B-6 cells. This earlier and greater expression of MHC class II antigen was reflected in the RT1.D alpha-chain mRNA responses with peak levels in WRT cells after only 24 h of exposure to gamma IF, a period in which 1B-6 cells showed only minor increases in mRNA. To examine whether these differences in class II MHC expression were thyroid-cell specific, primary pulmonary fibroblast lines from Wistar and Fisher rats were developed and a similar, although less marked, variation in susceptibility to gamma IF was observed. Hence, those rats strains that are resistant to autoimmune thyroid disease exhibit a fundamental difference in their MHC class II gene responsiveness to cytokines, which may contribute to their disease susceptibility profiles.\r"

Both mAbs against BNP possessed high affinities for BNP, with association constants (Ka) of 4.0 X 10(9) M-1 (KY-BNP-I) and 2.0 X 10(10) M-1 (KY-BNP-II). With these mAbs, specific RIAs for BNP have been established. The least detectable quantities of BNP were 5 pg/tube (KY-BNP-I) and 1 pg/tube (KY-BNP-II). Cross-reactivities of alpha-human and rat atrial natriuretic polypeptides were less than 0.001%. These RIAs detected BNP-like immunoreactivity (BNP-LI) not only in the porcine brain but also in the canine brain, with the highest concentration in the medulla oblongata. These RIAs also detected BNP-LI in both the porcine and canine hearts and in the porcine plasma. The iv pretreatment of purified mAb[KY-BNP-II] almost completely blocked the hypotensive action of iv administered BNP in rats, with the concomitant suppression of BNP-induced increase of the plasma cyclic GMP level. These results indicate that our mAbs against BNP will serve as a useful tool for the elucidation of the physiological and pathophysiological significance of BNP as a neuropeptide and as a hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Since intact adult male rats have higher GH pulse amplitude than do castrated animals and since GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) secretion is predominantly responsible for the production of these GH pulses, we hypothesized that testosterone stimulates GHRH synthesis in neurons of the hypothalamus. To test this hypothesis, we compared GHRH mRNA content in individual neurons of the arcuate (ARC) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei among groups of intact (n = 3), castrated (n = 5), and castrated testosterone-replaced (n = 5) adult male rats. Cellular GHRH mRNA content was measured by using semiquantitative in situ hybridization with an 35S-labeled cRNA probe complementary to the coding sequence of rat GHRH mRNA. Castration resulted in an approximately 35% decline in GHRH mRNA signal relative to that in intact animals in both the ARC (P less than 0.005) and VMH (P less than 0.005). Replacement with testosterone at the time of castration completely prevented the decline in both areas. Testosterone can exert effects either through activation of the androgen receptor directly or through aromatization to estradiol; therefore, we also examined the effects on GHRH mRNA of replacement with 17 beta-estradiol (n = 5) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a nonaromatizable androgen (n = 4). Estradiol had no effect on the castration-induced decline in GHRH mRNA in either the ARC or VMH. In contrast, DHT partially prevented the postcastration decline in GHRH in the ARC (P less than 0.005), while having no statistically significant effect on GHRH mRNA in the VMH. These results clearly indicate that testosterone stimulates expression of GHRH mRNA in neurons of the hypothalamus. Furthermore, the failure of estradiol to substitute for testosterone and the ability of DHT to substantially support GHRH mRNA suggest that testosterone exerts its effects on GHRH gene expression predominantly through direct activation of the androgen receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of bovine FSH-suppressing protein (FSP) or follistatin on activin- and GnRH-stimulated FSH synthesis and secretion have been studied using cultured pituitary cells from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Exposure to FSP (0.001-10 nM) for 3 days dose-dependently suppressed basal FSH secretion (IC50 = 146 +/- 21 pM., mean +/- SE), cellular content (IC50 = 269 +/- 8 pM) and total FSH (IC50 = 181 +/- 25 pM), with no effect on LH. Activin (0.3 nM) increased FSH secretion 2.1-fold, cellular content 1.3-fold, and total FSH 1.9-fold during a 3-day incubation, but these increases were dose-dependently inhibited by concomitant treatment with 35-kDa bovine FSP (0.1-3 nM), with complete inhibition occurring at concentrations between 1 and 3 nM. The 31- and 39-kDa forms of bovine FSP also antagonized the actions of activin. GnRH (1 nM) increased FSH secretion 1.8-fold and total FSH 1.6-fold during a 3-day incubation, effects that were dose-dependently inhibited by concomitant treatment with 35-kDa bovine FSP. The highest tested concentration of FSP (3 nM) suppressed GnRH-stimulated FSH secretion and total FSH to 59 and 57%, respectively, of the levels found in untreated cultures. All three forms of bovine FSP produced a significant inhibition of FSH secretion and total FSH stimulated by GnRH. FSP also suppressed FSH secretion and total FSH in response to activators of protein kinase C including 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (43 and 59%, respectively) and 100 nM mezerein (40 and 60%, respectively). Finally, treatment of cultured pituitary cells with 35-kDa FSP at 1 and 3 nM for 3 days resulted in 21 and 24% decreases in GnRH binding sites, respectively. It is concluded that (i) FSP inhibits not only the secretion but also the synthesis of FSH induced by activin and GnRH in long-term culture, and (ii) FSP may cause its inhibitory effects on GnRH by suppression of the protein kinase C system, and possibly by reduction of GnRH binding sites.\r"

In contrast, the present studies have found that 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited the ability of IFN gamma to induce class II antigen expression on nontransformed rat thyroid follicular epithelial cells (FRTL-5) and mouse testicular Leydig cells (TM3). Although 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited the induction of both IA and IE class II locus products, IFN gamma augmentation of class I major histocompatibility complex antigens was not affected. 1,24-(OH)2D3 and 24,25-(OH)2D3 also inhibited class II induction by IFN gamma. Notably, the relative inhibitory ability of these compounds paralleled the strength of their binding affinities for the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor, indicating that this antagonistic effect probably requires receptor-ligand interaction. Other steroid hormones, such as hydrocortisone or testosterone, had no inhibitory effect on IFN gamma-induced class II expression on Leydig cells. Additionally, the failure of indomethacin to reverse the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the finding that exogenous prostaglandin E2 did not inhibit class II induction in these cells indicated that prostaglandins are probably not responsible for this anti-IFN gamma activity. In total, these results suggest that an endocrinological mediator is capable of inhibiting class II induction on resident endocrine tissue populations and, therefore, could help to diminish local CD4+ T-cell recognition of these cells.\r"

  ".U": "90353293\r", 
  ".W": "The present studies were designed to investigate the mechanism by which neuropeptide-Y (NPY) augments the effect of LHRH to stimulate the release of LH from cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. Anterior pituitary cells from ovariectomized rats were enzymatically dispersed, cultured for 3 days, and then exposed to various secretagogues during 3-h incubations. As reported by this laboratory previously, NPY alone (100 nM) did not affect LH release, but significantly enhanced the LH response to 1 nM LHRH. This facilitatory action of NPY was mimicked by the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644 (1 microM), and the enhancement of LHRH-induced LH release by either NPY or Bay K 8644 was prevented by the dihydropyridine antagonist nitrendipine (1 microM). Nitrendipine alone reduced the response to LHRH by approximately 25%, but did not affect basal LH release. In contrast, NPY failed to amplify the release of PRL in response to TRH, another Ca2(+)-mobilizing hormone. To test whether NPY also enhances the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by LHRH, anterior pituitary cells were acutely dispersed into single cell suspensions, loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ probe Indo-1 AM, and analyzed with a UV laser in an EPICS-753 flow cytometer at a rate of 500 cells/sec for 200 sec. The ratio of intracellular fluorescence resulting from Ca2+ bound to the Indo-1 to the fluorescence from Indo-1 alone (Indo-1 ratio), which is an index of the concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+, was determined for each cell. Approximately 7% of anterior pituitary cells responded to LHRH (1 or 10 nM) with significant increases in Indo-1 ratios, indicative of an increase in the concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+. EGTA (2.5 mM) reduced the basal Indo-1 ratios and attenuated, but did not abolish, the initial increase in response to LHRH, consistent with the initial extracellular Ca2+ influx-independent phase of the response to LHRH. NPY alone (100 nM) did not affect the Indo-1 ratios in anterior pituitary cells, but pretreatment with the peptide for 10 min before the scans significantly augmented the Indo-1 ratio response to 10 nM LHRH. This effect of NPY was also blocked by EGTA. Taken together, these biochemical and pharmacological studies suggest that NPY enhances the release of LH stimulated by LHRH by increasing extracellular Ca2+ entry, possibly by selectively affecting that component of the response involving dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels during the initial stages of the cellular response to LHRH.\r"

  ".U": "90353298\r", 
  ".W": "Repeatedly passed or aged rat FRTL-5 thyroid cells develop a high level of basal [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and a reduced response to TSH in medium containing 5% serum and insulin (5H medium). The basal [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of aged cells can exceed the TSH-induced increase in earlier passages of the same cell line (fresh cells) and the TSH response decreases from more than 10-fold above basal in fresh cells to less than 2-fold in aged cells. This change is not associated with a loss of the diploid karyotype, a change in basal cAMP levels, or a change in dependence on TSH for cell growth. Attenuation of the TSH response in the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay is more evident than the reduced effect of TSH on cAMP levels or iodide transport; moreover, the TSH effect on cAMP levels does not correlate with that on [3H] thymidine incorporation as a function of hormone concentration. The high basal activity in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in aged cells is due to an increased responsiveness to insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), or serum. Thus, removal of serum and insulin from the medium eliminates the high basal [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and this activity is restored by insulin or IGF-I in a concentration-dependent manner. The increased responsiveness of aged cells to insulin or IGF-I is inhibited by indomethacin or hydrocortisone and is associated with insulin or IGF-I, but not TSH, stimulation of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) isomerase-like activity. Fresh cells, in contrast, require TSH plus insulin or IGF-I to increase these activities. Increased responsiveness of cyclooxygenase activity to insulin or IGF-I in aged cells reflects at least in part an increase in cyclooxygenase mRNA levels. We suggest that insulin/IGF-I stimulation of PGE2 production leads to the high basal thymidine incorporation into DNA in aged cells maintained in TSH-depleted (5H) medium; the reduced stimulation by TSH of cAMP content or iodide uptake may reflect PG inhibition (negative feedback regulation) of cAMP production.\r"

Four strokes were hemorrhagic and nine were nonhemorrhagic. Of five prespecified risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage (age greater than 65 years, history of hypertension, history of prior cerebrovascular disease, aspirin use and acute hypertension), two patients had two risk factors and one patient had one risk factor. However, 80% of patients without intracranial hemorrhage had at least one risk factor and 31% had two risk factors. No patient with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (all greater than 6 months previously) had an intracranial hemorrhage. Of three prespecified risk factors for nonhemorrhagic stroke (atrial fibrillation, prior cerebrovascular disease and large anterior wall infarction), only the occurrence of a large anterior myocardial infarction (with ejection fraction less than 45%) was a predictor (p = 0.0015). The in-hospital death rate was 25% for patients with hemorrhagic stroke versus 11% for patients with a non-hemorrhagic stroke and 6% for those patients without a stroke. Furthermore, the hospital stay was greater than 50% longer in patients who had a stroke than in those who did not. Thus, intracranial hemorrhage remains an unpredictable risk in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy and cerebral infarction is related to anterior myocardial infarction and poor left ventricular function. Both types of stroke are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.\r"

They were treated with combined intracoronary (20 mg)/intravenous (50 mg) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and repeat mild balloon inflations. Reopening of the vessel was achieved in 22 patients (81.5%). Follow-up coronary angiography 24 to 36 h later revealed reocclusion in 12 patients (54.5%). Thrombin levels measured as thrombin-antithrombin-III complex in patients with successful thrombolysis and persistent patency decreased from 8.5 +/- 11.4 micrograms/liter at baseline to 3.5 +/- 1.4 micrograms/liter 120 min after the start of thrombolysis; these levels increased from 9.4 +/- 15.0 micrograms/liter at baseline to 15.7 +/- 13.5 micrograms/liter 120 min after the start of thrombolysis in the patients with unsuccessful thrombolysis or early reocclusion (p less than 0.05). When a borderline value for thrombin-antithrombin-III complex level of 6 micrograms/liter was selected to separate the two groups of patients, patients with an unfavorable clinical course were identified 120 min after the start of thrombolysis by levels greater than 6 micrograms/liter (sensitivity 100%, specificity 92.8%). Thus, after abrupt thrombotic vessel closure during coronary angioplasty, the short-term results of thrombolysis seem to be governed by the release of thrombin. In two thirds of patients, however, the thrombin release cannot be suppressed by concomitant aspirin and heparin therapy. Even after successful reopening of the vessel these patients should therefore undergo immediate aortocoronary bypass grafting.\r"

  ".W": "Pro-urokinase is a single chain precursor of two chain urokinase, which has been shown to induce fibrin-selective plasminogen activation. In the present study, thrombolytic efficacy of 9 million U of glycosylated pro-urokinase administered intravenously was compared with that of a combined regimen utilizing 4.5 million U of pro-urokinase and 0.2 million U of urokinase. Seventy-five patients with a first myocardial infarction were randomized to receive high dose pro-urokinase (n = 40, group A) or the combination therapy (n = 35, group B). Reperfusion of the infarct-related artery was assessed by repeat coronary angiography. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial (TIMI) grade II or III reperfusion was achieved in 73% of group A patients compared with 66% of group B patients (p = NS). A trend toward faster reopening of the infarct-related artery was observed in patients in group B. Coronary artery reocclusion occurred in 5 (10%) of 49 patients in whom angiography was repeated within 36 h after the start of therapy. Clot-selective thrombolysis was indicated by a minimal fibrinogen decline (15% and 13%, respectively, in groups A and B). Alpha 2-antiplasmin levels, however, decreased more rapidly in patients in group B (p less than 0.05). This finding and the equivalent reperfusion rate in the combined treatment group strongly suggest synergistic interaction between these two thrombolytic agents. In summary, the high incidence of reperfusion, the low rate of early reocclusion and the paucity of side effects, particularly with regard to bleeding complications, indicate that pro-urokinase possesses the characteristics of an ideal thrombolytic agent.\r"

Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated interleukin-2 production by PBMC collected on day 5 after rhinovirus inoculation was increased fourfold compared with production by PBMC collected before rhinovirus challenge (P less than .05); phytohemagglutinin-stimulated interferon-gamma production was doubled (P less than .05). An inverse relationship was observed between the increase in interleukin-2 production and both nasal mucus production (P less than .02) and the number of days virus was cultured from nasal washings (P less than .02). Natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity of PBMC collected on day 5 after rhinovirus challenge was also increased (P less than .01) compared with preinfection levels, as was specific antigen-stimulated blastogenesis on day 21 (P less than .05). The extent of blastogenic response correlated directly with both mucus production (P less than .05) and the number of days virus was cultured from nasal washings (P less than .05). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that rhinovirus infection results in activation of a systemic cellular immune response.\r"

Eight human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adult men with lymphadenopathy or early AIDS-related complex (ARC) symptoms were enrolled in each treatment group. No anti-HIV effect was observed as evaluated by coculture of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells or by the level of serum p24 antigenemia. Neither enhancement of two functional lymphocyte markers (specific antigen-induced blastogenesis or interferon-gamma production) nor reduction in serum beta 2-microglobulins was noted. Mild clinical adverse reactions and anemia were observed in both treatment groups. Significant reductions in total lymphocytes, T lymphocytes (CD2 cells), and T lymphocyte subsets (CD4 and CD8 cells) were most notable in the 1600-mg group. Reduction in the lymphocyte populations was most likely due to a direct ribavirin lymphotoxic effect. These observations indicate that ribavirin had no demonstrable beneficial effect on virologic or immunologic HIV surrogate markers at daily doses associated with adverse reactions.\r"

Sugar analysis by gas-liquid chromatography of trimethylsilylated methyl glycosides revealed that the LPS of the 10 serotypes contained glucose, galactose, L-glycero-D-mannoheptose, and glucosamine in various proportions. LPS 1, 2, 8, and 9 contained the highest amounts of glucose and galactose relative to L-glycero-D-mannoheptose, which is considered present in constant amounts in H. influenzae LPS.

Changes in the viability of M. tuberculosis were determined by agar plate colony counts and a radiometric assay. No impairment in killing was seen with any of the inhibitors or enzymes. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) have a defect in the NADPH oxidase pathway, causing their neutrophils to be unable to generate oxygen radicals. If these radicals are involved in killing, then CGD neutrophils should be less effective killers of M. tuberculosis than normal neutrophils. There was no evidence by either measure of M. tuberculosis viability that CGD neutrophils were less bactericidal than normal neutrophils. Killing by normal neutrophils was also effective in the absence of serum. These results lead to the conclusion that the mechanism by which M. tuberculosis is killed by neutrophils is independent of the oxygen metabolic burst.\r"

Reports of adverse outcome with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis in other patient groups, and the recent occurrence of several severe fungal infections in patients followed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), prompted a review of the NIH experience to examine the incidence of nonfungal and fungal infections in CGD patients with and without TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Prophylaxis decreased the incidence of nonfungal infections from 7.1 to 2.4 per 100 patient-months in patients with autosomal CGD (P less than .01) and from 15.8 to 6.9 infections per 100 patient-months (P = .06) in X-linked CGD patients. There was no significant change in the incidence of fungal infection in CGD patients on TMP-SMX (1.5-0.3 fungal infections/100 patient-months in autosomal CGD and 1.7-0.2 fungal infections/100 patient-months in X-linked CGD patients). TMP-SMX prophylaxis is indicated for the management of patients with CGD and decreases the incidence of non-fungal infections without increasing the incidence of fungal infections.\r"

There was no correlation between clinical response to IFN-gamma and change in any immune variables. Because of the observed alterations in B cell numbers, serum immunoglobulins were measured by radial immunodiffusion. There was no alteration of levels of most immunoglobulin isotypes as a result of therapy. There was a modest increase in serum IgA.

In one case the IgG globulin fraction containing the inhibitor was separated. The activation rate of pure protein C to its activated form using thrombin/thrombomodulin as activator was then measured in the presence or absence of lupus anticoagulant. No overall decrease of protein C or protein S was detected in patients' plasma. Nevertheless, the lupus anticoagulant had a specific effect on the protein C system, inhibiting the catalytic activity of thrombomodulin without causing a functional protein C deficiency. This specific effect upon thrombomodulin can be a main cause, but not necessarily the only one, for the thrombophilic tendency of patients with the lupus anticoagulant.\r"

To do this, we have employed volume expansion, nursed patients in the flat position, and actively used catecholamine infusions to maintain the SABP side of the CPP equation at levels necessary to obtain the target CPP. CSF drainage and mannitol have freely been used to maintain the ICP portion of the equation. Thirty-four consecutive patients with GCS less than or equal to 7 were admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit (GCS = 5.1 +/- 1.4) and managed with this protocol. CPP was maintained at 84 +/- 11 mm Hg, ICP was 23 +/- 9.8 mm Hg, and SABP averaged 106 +/- 11 mm Hg. CVP was 8.0 +/- 3.7 mm Hg and average fluid intake was approximately 5.4 +/- 3.9 liters/d. Output averaged 5.0 +/- 4.0 liters/d; additionally, albumin (25%) (33 +/- 44 gm/d) and PRBCs were used for vascular expansion and hemoglobin was maintained (11.5 +/- 1.4 gm/dl). Three patients died of uncontrolled ICP (all protocol errors). Four other patients succumbed, none secondary to ICP and all secondary to potentially avoidable complications. Morbidity (GOS = 4.2 +/- 0.87) appeared to be as good or superior to previous methods of therapy. Overall, mortality was 21% and that from uncontrollable ICP was 8%. This approach to the management of intracranial hypertension proved safe, rational, and greatly enhanced the therapeutic options available. It was also consistent with optimal care of other organ systems. The results bring into question many of the standard tenets of neurosurgical ICP management and suggest new avenues of investigation.\r"

This paper examines the present financial status of the Burn Center at the University of New Mexico Hospital, as well as the future impact if all third-party payments were based on the DRG system. For fiscal years 1985-1987, the Burn Center lost $246,512 over cost for Medicare patients. There was a profit of $724,762 for other third-party payors, and a loss of $692,354 for indigent patients. This resulted in a total loss of $214,101 for the Burn Center during the 3-year study period. With the hypothetical conversion++ of all third-party reimbursement to DRGs, the total 3-year loss would become $1,253,393. The effect of DRG 472, a recent change in burn DRG classification, is discussed, as well as specific recommendations to rectify current problems.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of hypoxia on splanchnic angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated prostaglandin (PG) release was examined in male rats. The superior mesenteric artery was cannulated and perfused in vitro with physiologic buffer at a pO2 of 460 or 60 torr. Splanchnic vessels were perfused isolated (SV) or in continuity with the small intestine (SV + SI). AII (10-300 ng) was infused as bolus injections. Quantitative analysis of SV + SI effluent by bioassay indicated the predominant PG released was PGI2. Quantitative analysis by radioimmunoassay confirmed PGI2 as the major PG released from the SV and SV + SI following AII stimulation. Relative hypoxia significantly decreased AII-stimulated release of PGI2 from the SV, and only modestly from the SV + SI. These data demonstrate two splanchnic sources of AII-stimulated vasodilator PG synthesis, the SV and SV + SI, with the SV more sensitive to relative hypoxia. Diminished release of splanchnic vascular (SV) vasodilator PGI2 may be of importance in AII-mediated splanchnic vasoconstriction seen in hypoxia and shock.\r"

  ".U": "90355288\r", 
  ".W": "Using flow cytometry tumors can be classified according to their deoxyribonucleic acid content as diploid or aneuploid with 1 or several cell lines and to the ploidy level of the aneuploid cell lines, as well as to the proportion of proliferating cells. We used this technique in 73 patients with invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who received radical radiation therapy with followup of surviving patients for at least 5 years. The effects of therapy were related to the deoxyribonucleic acid patterns before irradiation. All diploid tumors disappeared, while aneuploid tumors with 1 cell line disappeared in 55% and those with several cell lines in 30% of the patients. Aneuploid tumors with cell lines exceeding 4c appeared to be more radiosensitive than those in the triploid region. Thus, tumors unresponsive to therapy as well as those that recurred after irradiation were mostly triploid. Since most of the tumors had high proliferation rates the proportion of S-phase cells was of only limited value for further classification of the various tumors. In the choice between radical radiotherapy, in which bladder function is maintained, and cystectomy an analysis of tumor ploidy provides at least some basis on which radiation response can be predicted. In the choice of therapy we must also consider the fact that almost 20% of the patients who failed to respond to therapy revealed aneuploidy only in bladder washings after irradiation, indicating existence of concomitant carcinoma in situ.\r"

The method consisted of inoculating transplantable human prostate cancer cells subcutaneously over the calvaria in nude mice resulting in a local tumor causing fragmentation of the bone. The parameters included assessing the extent of decreased osteolysis in bone as judged by X-ray and histological examination. The results showed the following sequence of potency: AHBuBP greater than AHPrBP greater than HEBP. The compounds were active not only when administered preventively before establishment of bone resorption, but also in an inhibitory fashion once the variables were already under the influence of the tumor. This inhibition was obtained with no apparent effect on the growth of the tumor. AHBuBP appears to be an interesting new bisphosphonate for future clinical use.\r"

Respiratory pathogens were found more commonly in older patients with meningitis (odds ratios were 2.9 for children under age 5 years and 46.5 in those over age 15 years), consistent with the increasing risk of meningitis with age during epidemics. In controls, the presence of respiratory pathogens increased the risk of upper-respiratory-tract symptoms but did not significantly increase meningococcal carriage.\r"

The locations of the lesions included the postcentral gyrus in five patients, the precentral gyrus in five, and the deep-seated left posterior temporal region in four, all of which were sites that may have precluded standard craniotomy and cortical resection. Of the 30 medically refractory patients, 26 had at least an 80% reduction in seizure activity at a mean duration of follow-up of 22 months postoperatively. Nineteen of 22 patients with at least 1 year (mean, 28 months) of follow-up and 13 of 15 patients with at least 2 years (mean, 34 months) of follow-up had favorable surgical outcomes. \"Lesionectomy\" may allow pathologic examination of intracranial lesions and may produce a worthwhile reduction in seizure activity in some patients with intractable partial epilepsy.\r"

Radiation fields were the craniospinal axis in 39 patients, PF plus spinal axis in 12, PF in 6, and whole brain in 1. Median radiation doses were 43 Gy (22 to 60 Gy) to the PF and 34 Gy (6.2 to 50 Gy) to the spinal axis. Overall 5- and 10-year survivals were 50% and 33%, respectively; 5- and 10-year relapse-free survivals were 46% and 32%. Treatment failed in 34 patients (59%): in 18 who had irradiation to the craniospinal axis (13 had received 50 Gy or less to the PF) and in 16 who had a radiation field of less than the craniospinal axis. A statistically significant (P less than 0.05) improvement in 10-year survival was associated with the following prognostic variables: PF dose of 50 Gy or more, whole-brain irradiation, and spinal axis irradiation. In comparison with subtotal resection, total resection was correlated with better 10-year relapse-free survival but not overall survival. All five patients with initial treatment failure only in the spine had received a radiation dose of 30 Gy or less to the spinal axis. The 2-year survival after relapse was 46% with salvage chemotherapy or irradiation in 23 patients and 0% in the 11 patients who received no further treatment (P less than 0.01).\r"

The other 6 are alive 101-186 days postoperatively, and five are insulin-free or on insulin only during night-time parenteral alimentation. C-peptide increased 1.7 to 3.3 fold in response to intravenous glucose in these five patients who have had glycosylated haemoglobin in the high normal range. However, the kinetics of the C-peptide responses to intravenous glucose in all eight patients tested revealed an absent first-phase release and a delayed peak response consistent with transplantation and/or engraftment of a suboptimal islet cell mass. The longest survivor, who requires neither parenteral alimentation nor insulin, is the first unequivocal example of successful clinical islet-cell transplantation.\r"

Doses above 9.6 mg/kg per day of ddI were frequently associated with toxicity (peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, or hepatitis). Doses of 9.6 mg/kg per day or below were well tolerated for up to 21 months. A subset of patients receiving 3.2-9.6 mg/kg per day of ddI had long-term immunological improvement and reduction of serum HIV p24 antigen. Immunological changes were especially seen in patients who had little previous zidovudine therapy. 5 patients with HIV-induced cognitive impairment improved with ddI.

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infection are major complications of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Since intravenous immunoglobulin has shown benefit in several immunodeficiency and autoimmune disorders, we studied its antimicrobial and immunomodulatory role after marrow transplantation. METHODS. In a randomized trial of 382 patients, transplant recipients given immunoglobulin (500 mg per kilogram of body weight weekly to day 90, then monthly to day 360 after transplantation) were compared with controls not given immunoglobulin. By chance, the immunoglobulin group included more patients with advanced-stage neoplasms; otherwise, the study groups were balanced for prognostic factors. RESULTS. Control patients seronegative for cytomegalovirus who received seronegative blood products remained seronegative, but seronegative patients who received immunoglobulin and screened blood had a passive transfer of cytomegalovirus antibody (median titer, 1:64). Among the 61 seronegative patients who could be evaluated, none contracted interstitial pneumonia; among the 308 seropositive patients evaluated, 22 percent of control patients and 13 percent of immunoglobulin recipients had this complication (P = 0.021). Control patients had an increased risk of gram-negative septicemia (relative risk = 2.65, P = 0.0039) and local infection (relative risk = 1.36, P = 0.029) and received 51 more units of platelets than did immunoglobulin recipients. Neither survival nor the risk of relapse was altered by immunoglobulin. However, among patients greater than or equal to 20 years old, there was a reduction in the incidence of acute GVHD (51 percent in controls vs. 34 percent in immunoglobulin recipients; P = 0.0051) and a decrease in deaths due to transplant-related causes after transplantation of HLA-identical marrow (46 percent vs. 30 percent; P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS. Passive immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin decreases the risk of acute GVHD, associated interstitial pneumonia, and infections after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Antigens are generally thought to be recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes as peptides in the context of class I major histocompatibility proteins complex, which are heterodimers of heavy chains noncovalently associated with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m). The highly polymorphic nature of the heavy chains and their resulting ability to present different sets of peptides has presumably evolved to allow potent immune responses against most pathogens. By contrast, the polymorphism of beta 2m is limited; seven alleles are known in the mouse and only one has been identified in humans. beta 2-Microglobulin was consequently thought to have only structural functions: namely, to ensure correct folding of class I molecules and their transport to the cell surface. Although beta 2m is not implicated directly in the formation of the peptide binding site, we report here that it participates in the selection of MHC class I molecule-associated peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Avian sarcoma virus 17 induces fibrosarcomas in chickens and can transform a number of avian cell types in vitro by the action of v-jun. This gene and the related cellular genes c-jun, jun B and jun D, encode transactivating (or repressing) DNA-binding proteins that form homo- or heterodimeric (Jun-Jun and Jun-Fos) complexes which recognize the AP-1 consensus sequence TGACTCA, a response element that confers sensitivity to the tumour-promoting phorbol ester TPA. We have produced several lines of transgenic mice carrying the v-jun oncogene, driven by the promoter of the widely expressed H-2KK major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen gene. Transgenic animals are initially phenotypically normal, but after full-thickness wounding they show abnormal wound repair, characterized by hyperplastic granulation tissue. Many of these lesions are slowly progressive because of continuing fibroblast proliferation, and over 2-5 months some give rise to dermal fibrosarcomas. This reproducible multistep transition through a proliferative but benign intermediate is associated with characteristic increments in v-jun expression. Moreover, hyperplastic wound repair and its progression are both related to transgene dosage, suggesting that there exists a quantitative requirement or threshold for v-jun action. Our results indicate that v-jun is not oncogenic in transgenic mice as a result of a 'single-hit' mechanism, but rather, in addition to an obligatory wound, that secondary genetic or epigenetic events (possibly conscripting normal constituents of wound repair) are necessary for tumour development and progression.\r"

It has been established that Escherichia coli cytochrome b1, cytochrome b557 and bacterioferritin are identical. The optical spectra at room temperature of the haem group show it to be predominantly low-spin in both the ferrous and ferric states. The nature of the axial ligands binding the haem group to the polypeptide has, however, remained unknown. Low-spin, bis-coordinate haem centres in proteins typically have a role in rapid electron transfer as redox changes at the metal ion lead to little structural rearrangement. There are only four amino acids with side-chains that have ligand field strengths sufficient to generate the low-spin state of haem, namely, histidine, lysine, methionine and cysteine. Hence there are, potentially, ten different pairs of these four ligands which could be discovered in electron transfer haemoproteins. To date only three have been established with certainty. They are bis-histidine, as in mammalian cytochrome b5, methionine-histidine, typified by cytochrome c and lysine-histidine, recently recognized by spectroscopic methods in cytochrome f. Here we report the electron paramagnetic resonance and near infrared magnetic circular dichroism spectra of the oxidized state of Ps. aeruginosa bacterioferritin which enable the axial ligands to be identified as the thioether side chains of two methionine residues, a ligation scheme not previously reported for haem in any protein.\r"

The majority of patients had subclinical hypothyroidism manifested by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. The incidence of hypothyroidism dramatically increased to 65% when radiotherapy was combined with surgery that included a partial thyroidectomy. In addition, we report the unusual occurrence of massive head, neck, and hypopharyngeal edema caused by severe hypothyroidism in two patients.

We have attempted to correlate cause of deafness, preoperative radiologic study, and postoperative stimulability and performance with preoperative stimulation. Round window stimulation procedures consisted of measurements of electrical thresholds and comfort levels, gap detection, and temporal difference limen. Radiologic studies were performed using high-resolution computerized semi-axial and coronal tomography with 1.5-millimeter overlapping cuts. Patient performance was measured using a standard audiologic test battery. Sixteen postlingually, profoundly deaf adults who received the Nucleus multichannel cochlear implant were studied. All 16 patients who responded to preoperative stimulation had acceptable CT scans for the ear operated on and stimulated postoperatively with the prosthesis. The lowest level at which a patient could reliably detect a gap between two signals ranged from 10 to 150 milliseconds, which was not predictive. For the temporal difference limen task, the patients who could reliably identify the longer of two pulses when the difference was less than 100 milliseconds did achieve varying amounts of open-set speech discrimination postoperatively. In summary, results indicate that the preoperative psychoacoustic electrical stimulation test battery provides useful information in predicting postoperative performance.\r"

Among 128 temporal bones with otosclerosis, involvement of the vestibular aqueduct by otosclerosis was observed in four temporal bones from two patients. In all four, the vestibular aqueduct was filled with active otosclerotic foci; the lumen of the endolymphatic duct and sac was narrowed as a result of fibrosis, and endolymphatic hydrops, more severe in the pars inferior than the pars superior, was observed. Collapse of the ductus reuniens and dilated saccule was seen in three temporal bones. Our study indicates that otosclerotic obstruction of the vestibular aqueduct may create a disturbance of the outflow and/or absorption of endolymph, leading to the development of endolymphatic hydrops and Meniere's disease, thus supporting the theory of longitudinal flow of endolymph.\r"

However, its true implication for patient survival is not known. A retrospective 10-year study showed that second primary malignancies developed in 207 of 875 patients. Second primary malignancies were most commonly associated with glottic index tumors, followed by floor of mouth tumors. The second primary was most likely to occur at a time interval of 1.5 years from diagnosis of the index tumor. Second primary neoplasms were more likely to develop in patients whose original head and neck tumor was stage I or II, or whose histopathology showed well or moderately well differentiation. Patients with head and neck cancer in whom a second upper aerodigestive tract tumor develops have a 75% chance of 1-year survival, but only a 25% chance of 5-year survival. The average time from diagnosis of second primary to the time of death was 2.3 years. If we are to increase the survival time of our patients with head and neck cancer, we must consider that a second primary will develop in one of four patients. We must therefore consider the high risk of second primary malignancy when formulating the original treatment plan for a patient manifesting his or her first head and neck cancer.\r"

Here we present two cases of allergic fungal sinusitis--one caused by Curvularia lunata species (an ubiquitous soil fungi), another caused by Alternaria. Only one other case of allergic fungal sinusitis caused by curvularia in which extensive immunologic testing was done has appeared in the literature. No reports of alternaria causing allergic fungal sinusitis have appeared in the literature. Diagnostic criteria for allergic fungal sinusitis include radiologic evidence of pansinusitis in an atopic individual; findings at surgery of allergic mucin; positive fungal cultures; and specific immunologic testing, including both humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. Treatment options for allergic fungal sinusitis are discussed and include surgery alone, surgery and steroids, or steroids alone. The role of allergy immunotherapy injections remains to be defined. In general, fungal infections--and especially phaeohyphomycosis--are very rare, but appear to be increasing in frequency, especially in the paranasal sinus region.\r"

This review of 11 years' experience with the retrosigmoid approach to acoustic neuroma removal includes 335 procedures in 332 patients. There were no intraoperative deaths; two patients died in the postoperative period. The facial nerve was preserved in 86.3% of procedures, and auditory function was preserved in 45 procedures (34% of those tumors were 2 cm or smaller). Postoperative complications occurred in 101 procedures, the most common being cerebrospinal fluid otorhinorrhea in 40 cases; 25 of these required secondary surgery. Meningitis occurred 16 times and aspiration 8 times; all other complications were less frequent. Tumor removal was incomplete in eight procedures; in only one of these cases has tumor recurred. The six recurrences usually were identified 5 or more years postoperatively. This has prompted us to follow patients for 7 years postoperatively. Major changes in our management include the use of the supine position and of electrophysiologic monitoring. Advantages of the approach are: (1) wide access to the tumor, (2) applicability to all tumor sizes, (3) potential to preserve facial and auditory function in all cases, and (4) ability to change procedure without sacrificing labyrinth. This review confirms our confidence in this approach to acoustic neuroma removal.\r"

While purposeful \"avoidance\" of this structure may result in partial tumor removal, limited exposure of the petrous carotid artery may lead to inadvertent injury with life-threatening neurovascular sequelae. Twenty-five cases are reported in which surgical manipulation of the petrous carotid artery was necessary to accomplish total tumor removal or gain operative exposure to the skull base. A standard diagnostic radiographic assessment consisted of high-resolution computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and a 4-vessel angiography. Preoperative balloon occlusion of the involved internal carotid artery was performed in four patients. Surgical approaches used in this series were broadly classified as: infratemporal-anterolateral (14), pterional-infratemporal (6), or pterional-anterolateral (5). Intraoperative management of the carotid artery consisted of total decompression in 19 cases, decompression with mobilization in four patients, and resection in two instances. Major neurovascular complications included one stroke and death caused by arterial occlusion, one stroke and death caused by arterial spasm, one stroke caused by brain edema, and one death related to a postoperative carotid hemorrhage. Other nonvascular complications included brain swelling, cranial nerve palsies, dysphagia, ataxia, cerebrospinal fluid fistulae, flap necrosis with wound infection, and pneumocephalus. Invasive and noninvasive methods are outlined for the preoperative assessment of the petrous carotid in cases of advanced skull base disease and intraoperative management options are detailed.\r"

Because of their frequency specificity, distortion-product emissions have great potential for clinical use. The present report describes the results of initial studies in patients with known cochlear or retrocochlear disease, diagnosed with standard otologic and audiologic tests. The cochlear group consisted of those diagnosed with noise-induced hearing loss, Meniere's disease, or hereditary hearing loss, whereas patients with acoustic neuroma comprised a retrocochlear group. A final group consisted of patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss of unknown origin. Detailed distortion-product emission testing included the computer-controlled acquisition of \"audiograms\" and response/growth functions. The outcomes of these studies demonstrated that distortion-product emissions provide a noninvasive, frequency-specific test of sensory-cell function that objectively depicts the boundary between normal and abnormal hearing. These emissions were also able to effectively track dynamic changes in progressive disease processes. Finally, as a screening tool, acoustic distortion products provide an objective means of assessing cochlear status in infants and young children and in adults at risk for hearing loss. Because acoustic distortion products accurately measure the sensory component of a sensorineural hearing loss, distortion-product testing may play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of cochlear dysfunction.\r"

Procedures that use the posterosuperior chain approach the apex from the sinodural angle, the base of the zygomatic arch, the attic, or through the arch of the superior semicircular canal. Operations that use the anteroinferior chain reach the apex along the internal carotid canal (Ramadier's operation) or by a posterior infralabyrinthine approach between the descending facial nerve and jugular bulb. Inferior petrous apex cholesterol granulomas may be unreachable by any of these routes, and hence the subcochlear route is proposed as an alternative. The subcochlear approach starts in a triangle bounded superiorly by the cochlea, anteriorly by the internal carotid canal and posteriorly by the deep jugular vein. This operation requires lowering the inferior bony canal wall to the level of the \"crutch.\" It provides access to an inferiorly situated cholesterol granuloma, yet preserves hearing. It allows enough room for the placement of a tube drain from the petrous apex to the mastoid. It is particularly useful when a high jugular bulb precludes the use of the posterior infralabyrinthine route.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with previously confirmed diagnosis of acute-stage Meniere's disease were tested with the Vestibular Autorotation Test (VAT), a portable computerized test that measures the higher-frequency vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) to compute gain and phase. Patients were asked to fixate on a target and move their heads in synchrony with a computer-generated, sweep-frequency audible cue (0.5 to 6.0 Hz) through an 18-second test epoch. Head movements in both horizontal (yaw) and vertical (pitch) planes were used separately to test horizontal and vertical VORs, respectively. All subjects easily performed the VAT. Results of the horizontal tests were within normal limits for both gain and phase. The vertical gain was markedly high throughout the 2 to 6 Hz range. Mean vertical phase lags were reduced at higher frequencies. These results imply that the vertical VORs of acute-stage Meniere's patients are hypersensitive to the faster vertical head movements that occur commonly in daily activities.\r"

This methodology does not make allowance for the extremely variable nature of these tumors with respect to their cellular composition. Further, by destroying the cytoplasm and cell membranes, this methodology makes it impossible to distinguish the DNA content of the tumor cells from that of the background stromal and inflammatory cells. The authors present a methodology for the selective exclusion of inflammatory cell infiltrates from the DNA analysis of these tumors. Using this technique, it has been found that exclusion of the inflammatory cells allows the investigator to look more specifically at the malignant cell population. This has been most helpful in those samples in which the tumor cells have been diploid or near-diploid. With this technical refinement, the relationship between DNA ploidy and clinical prognosis may be more accurately assessed.\r"

A program of customized vestibular habituation therapy is introduced and its efficacy in a group of 65 patients is evaluated. Preliminary findings suggest that 59% of patients will have a dramatic improvement, after which their vestibular symptoms no longer cause any restriction in their lifestyles. An additional 23% of patients note considerable improvement, but have persistent symptoms that continue to restrict their activities. Vestibular habituation therapy is a rational, multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of chronic vestibular dysfunction that is a significant alternative to traditional pharmacologic management. Failure of vestibular compensation after involvement in a disciplined program of habituation therapy constitutes a much stronger indication for vestibular surgery in patients with unilateral peripheral lesions.\r"

Sensory receptors in vertical semicircular canals and utricles, via the vestibulospinal tract, mediate a disconjugate response to the legs, enabling synchronized reciprocal stabilization of the body for control of motion. The patient is systematically exposed to different combinations of useful and conflicting visual, vestibular, and support surface input. The effect of each on stability is appraised. Early posturography reports dealt primarily with sensory organization test (SOT) results. Improved software for movement coordination (MC) tests offer greater identification of problems involving the central nervous system. One hundred fifty-one patients were studied over a 9-month period. Central disorders were present in 31 cases (20.5%) and 90.3% of these were abnormal in sensory organization tests (SOTs). Abnormal movement coordination (MC) results occurred in 80.6% of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. SOTs 4, 5, and 6 in combination were abnormal in 35.5%, and 70% of these cases were also abnormal in MC responses. False-positive responses occurred in less than 4% of cases. Posturography offers a significantly high detection rate in CNS disorders causing dysequilibrium. Long loop latency reflexes, as they relate to maintenance of balance, appear important in the pathophysiology of abnormal SOT and MC responses.\r"

  ".W": "The urinalysis has long been considered an important screening test for hospitalized children. The value of the admission urinalyses, required by hospital bylaws, was assessed for detecting urinary tract disease in children admitted to a day-care unit or impatient medical or surgical services during the months of June and November 1987. Of 2695 admissions, urinalyses were considered essential for diagnosis or therapy in 543 patients (excluded from analysis). In the remaining 2152 patients eligible for screening, urinalyses were obtained in 145 (30%) of day-care unit and 587 (35%) of inpatient admissions. The results of 149 (20%) of screening urinalyses were abnormal (23% abnormal in inpatient and 10% abnormal in day-care unit admissions). The numbers of urinalyses with abnormal results were similar in surgical and medical admissions and between the months of June and November. Pyuria (90 patients) and hematuria (66 patients) were the most common abnormalities in initial urinalyses. Follow-up urinalyses and other diagnostic studies were obtained in 38% of patients with abnormal admission urinalysis results. In subsequent urinalyses, 58% showed persistent abnormalities; however, most subsequent abnormal results were not pursued with additional tests. Urinary tract infections were diagnosed in 6 patients. No other additional diagnoses were determined. The cost of initial urinalyses and subsequent diagnostic studies in these 732 patients during the 2 months was $23,465. The cost per diagnosis of urinary infection was $3911. It is concluded that when hospital bylaws require routine urinalyses at the time of admission, this requirement is frequently ignored and, in addition, abnormal results are often unappreciated or not pursued.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine an effective nutritional regimen for management of growth failure in infants with congenital heart disease and congestive heart failure, the authors studied 19 infants with cardiac anomalies who were not candidates for early corrective surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three feeding groups: group 1 (n = 7) received continuous, 24-hour nasogastric alimentation; group 2 (n = 5) received overnight, 12-hour nasogastric infusions plus daytime oral feedings as tolerated; and group 3 (n = 7) received oral feedings alone. For all patients, commercial infant formula (cow's milk or soy protein) was supplemented to a calorie density of approximately 1 kcal/mL. During a 5.25 +/- 0.45 month study period, only group 1 infants achieved intakes greater than 140 kcal/kg per day (mean = 147 kcal). Serial anthropometric measurements demonstrated that only 24-hour infusions (group 1) were associated with significantly improved nutritional status, when assessed by z scores for weight (P less than .01) and length (P less than .05). Group 1 infants also showed marked increases in midarm muscle circumference and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses (P less than .01, compared with groups 2 and 3). These data suggest that infants with congenital cardiac defects complicated by malnutrition manifest increased nutrient requirements for growth and weight gain. Continuous, 24-hour, nasogastric alimentation is a safe and effective method for achieving both increased nutrient intake and improved overall nutritional status in these infants.\r"

Fluid and energy (parenteral and oral) intakes were compared in four birth weight categories (1, less than or equal to 750 g; 2, 751 to 1000 g; 3, 1001 to 1250 g; 4, 1251 to 1500 g). Parenteral nutrition was the major source of first nutrition for the small infants, but seldom did it alone provide adequate nutrition for very low birth weight infants. The age of the first nutrition (parenteral and/or oral nutrition other than dextrose) decreased with increasing birth weight. The age of the first oral feedings was later for the infants of the lower birth weights but enteral feeding became the major nutrition for all weight categories by the second week of life. During the first 50 days the infants accumulated a deficit of 3780 to 5460 kJ relative to their estimated need of 504 kJ/kg per day, with the smaller infants accumulating a significantly larger deficit. The growth of infants appropriate for gestational age and of infants small for gestational age differed from each other and from the commonly used graph of Dancis et al (J Pediatr. 1948;33:570-572).\r"

Abnormalities of cutaneous thermal sensation were common, even in asymptomatic carriers, with a unique predilection for cold sensitivity which suggests involvement of small myelinated nerve fibres. Intracranial abnormalities were frequently detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in males, both with and without overt cerebrovascular disease, and were more extensive in older patients. Such abnormalities were not detected in carriers. Auditory and vestibular abnormalities were present in six patients, only one of whom was symptomatic. Cranial MRI and assessment of cutaneous thermal thresholds are sensitive techniques which can identify neurological involvement in asymptomatic patients. They may be of benefit in monitoring the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy and excluding the carrier state for the defective gene.\r"

Positive mammographic findings included the development of new fine calcifications (six patients), a new mass (five patients), mass and calcifications (one patient), increasing opacity (two patients), or skin thickening (one patient). Patients in whom the breast recurrence was detected mammographically alone were less likely to develop metastatic disease in subsequent follow-up than when results of physical examination were positive at the time of breast recurrence.

Patients were randomly assigned to either of two methods of managing PaCO2 (uncorrected for body temperature). In group 1 (PACO2 32-48 mm Hg, n = 13) the mean +/- SD cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen was 0.40 +/- 0.11 ml O2 X 100 g-1 X min-1 at a mean +/- SD PaCO2 of 36 +/- 2.0 mm Hg and 0.40 +/- 0.14 ml O2 X 100 g-1 X min-1 at a mean +/- SD PaCO2 of 45 +/- 2 mm Hg. and 49-72 mm Hg, n = 12) the mean +/- SD cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen was 0.31 +/- 0.09 ml O2 X 100 g-1 X min-1 at a mean +/- SD PaCO2 of 55 +/- 3 mm Hg and 0.21 +/- 0.07 ml O2 X 100 g-1 X min-1 at a mean +/- SD PaCO2 of 68 +/- 2 mm Hg. Group 2 values differed significantly from those in Group 1 (p less than 0.05). In both groups, cerebral blood flow increased as PaCO2 increased. During cardiopulmonary bypass, increasing PaCO2 increases cerebral blood flow and decreases the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen.\r"

Twenty-seven rat pups received a subcutaneous injection of 0.1 ml mannitol in a dosage of 4 mg/kg body wt immediately following cerebral hypoxia-ischemia and every 12 hours thereafter for a total of four doses. Control animals received either no therapy (n = 16) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (n = 24). Mannitol injections in six rat pups not subjected to hypoxia-ischemia produced no mortality but significantly increased serum osmolality from 287 to 361 mos/l (p less than 0.01). Preliminary studies indicated that substantial mortality occurred when greater doses of mannitol were administered to rats. After 48 hours of recovery from hypoxia-ischemia, the animals were killed and their brains were examined for either tissue water content (33 rat pups) or the presence of neuropathologic alterations (34 rat pups). Mannitol significantly reduced (p less than 0.001) brain water content, as a reflection of cerebral edema, in both the ipsilateral (88.5% compared with 90.6% in controls) and the contralateral (85.0% compared with 87.2% in controls) cerebral hemispheres. Mannitol therapy did not ameliorate the incidence, distribution, or severity of tissue injury in the cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, hippocampus, striatum, or thalamus of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere compared with the controls. Thus, while mannitol substantially reduces the extent of cerebral edema following hypoxia-ischemia, no beneficial affect on ultimate brain damage occurs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
