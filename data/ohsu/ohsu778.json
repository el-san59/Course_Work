  ".W": "The clinical manifestations of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are highly nonspecific since they usually mimic those of hepatic cirrhosis, which frequently underlies this neoplasm. The fact that some HCC patients present with severe diarrhea, an unusual symptom in liver cirrhosis, prompted us to determine the prevalence of diarrhea in a series of 23 consecutive HCC patients and compare it with that of a control group formed by cirrhotic patients without HCC, matched by age, sex, and etiology of the liver disease. All the patients were interviewed about the existence of diarrhea (defined as the presence of three or more loose stools per day appearing over three or more days) in the three months prior to admission. Both groups of patients were similar in regards to the degree of liver failure and presence of diarrhea-favoring factors. By contrast, diarrhea was significantly more frequent among HCC cases than among cirrhotics without HCC (47.8% vs 8.7%, P less than 0.005). HCC patients with diarrhea exhibited higher alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels and worse liver function, assessed by the Child-Pugh's classification, than patients without diarrhea. However, neither tumor size, vascular invasion, or the degree of tumor differentiation were significantly different between these two groups of HCC patients. These results show that diarrhea is a frequent manifestation of HCC in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, the development of HCC in these patients should be suspected upon the appearance of diarrhea.\r"

  ".W": "The liver is recognized as a sex hormone-responsive organ. Gender-specific differences in liver function are known to exist. Recently, a higher failure rate for organs transplanted in adults from female donors to male recipients has been reported. This increased failure rate of livers obtained from adult females and transplanted into adult males is thought to occur, at least in part, as a result of intrinsic gender-specific differences in hepatocyte cell surface expression and to alterations in the hormonal milieu of the donor liver in the recipient. To determine whether the same graft-recipient gender-determined failure rates pertain in the pediatric liver transplant population, the outcome of 335 primary liver transplants performed in children at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center was examined. No difference in transplant outcome was demonstrated in children based on the gender pairings between the donor and recipient whether or not variables such as the age, etiology of the liver disease, and the blood group of the recipient were included in the data analysis. Thus, in contrast, to the situation in adults, the gender of the donor does not influence the outcome of liver transplantation in children and should not be used as a criterion for donor selection. This difference between adults and children may be due, at least in part, to gender differences in hepatocyte phenotypic expression induced as a consequence of puberty.\r"

The hepatic iron index is a useful measurement in the diagnosis and management of patients with familial hemochromatosis.\r"

All patients had normal liver tests before treatment and had at least six determinations during a 6- to 36-month course of therapy with cyclosporine A at a dose of 2-10 mg/kg/day. Thirty-four (58%) patients developed at least one abnormality of liver tests, and 19 (32%) had a prolonged pattern of abnormalities. The usual abnormalities consisted of a mild, transient increase in alkaline phosphatase levels occasionally accompanied by slight elevations in serum bilirubin and aminotransferase activities. Peak alkaline phosphatase levels ranged from 125 to 243 units/liter and persisted for seven days to 48 months. Thus, biochemical evidence of mild cholestatic liver injury was common in patients receiving cyclosporine A. These abnormalities are usually self-limited and asymptomatic but may cause diagnostic difficulty if a preexisting liver disease is present.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of duodenal osmoreceptor stimulation on gallbladder motility was evaluated in 18 normal subjects during intraduodenal infusion of 280, 560 and 840 mosm/liters NaCl solutions. Gallbladder emptying was found to be dose-dependent between 560 and 840 mosm/liter (P less than 0.01 vs basal volume). The effect of duodenal infusion of hypertonic saline on gallbladder emptying was prevented by atropine and partially antagonized by naloxone, indicating that cholinergic and endorphinergic pathways may be involved in regulating this reflex. Since proglumide, a cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist, did not affect gallbladder emptying induced by hypertonic saline, it seems likely that CCK is not released by increasing duodenal osmolality. A significant reduction in gallbladder volume was obtained when hyperosmolar saline was delivered into the duodenum, whereas no emptying was seen when infused into the gastric antrum or the jejunum, suggesting that osmoreceptors that activate gallbladder emptying are located only in the duodenum. Additionally, all subjects manifested central symptoms (nausea or vomiting) during duodenal infusion of hypertonic saline, suggesting that central mechanisms might be activated by a change in duodenal osmolality. Our data indicate that the osmolality of duodenal contents might regulate gallbladder motility by neural atropine- and naloxone-sensitive pathways.\r"

The main sites of bleeding are esophageal varices, gastritis, and peptic ulcers. In order to determine the prevalence of either potential bleeding lesions or of other endoscopic findings in hemodynamically stable individuals with various etiologies of cirrhosis, 510 consecutive cirrhotic patients, evaluated for possible orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for combined diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The patients were divided into two main groups: 319 patients with parenchymal liver disease and 191 patients with cholestatic liver disease. Gastritis was found significantly more often in patients with parenchymal liver disease than in those with cholestatic liver disease (49.8% vs 30.9%; P less than 0.001). In contrast, the prevalence of esophagitis, esophageal and gastric varices, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, and duodenitis was similar in both groups. Normal endoscopic findings were present in 5.0% of the parenchymal group and 11.5% of the cholestatic group (P less than 0.02). Ascites and encephalopathy were found significantly more often in subjects with parenchymal liver disease as compared to those with cholestatic liver disease. Portal hypertension and its degree, as assessed by the presence and size of esophageal varices, was similar in both groups, and in both groups there was a statistically significant qualitative trend of increasing prevalence of esophageal varices with increasing severity of disease as estimated using Pugh-Child's criteria.\r"

In this study we determined the effect of cisapride on sphincter of Oddi motility of the Australian brush tailed possum in vivo, and evaluated possible mechanisms for its effect. Cisapride produced a dose-dependent inhibition of sphincter of Oddi phasic contractions. The inhibitory effect was not blocked by atropine, phentolamine, propranolol, methysergide, or hexamethonium administration, or after cervical truncal vagotomy. Tetrodotoxin, however, abolished the sphincter response to cisapride. We conclude that cisapride has an inhibitory effect on the possum sphincter of Oddi. This inhibitory effect is mediated via nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory neurons and is similar to the inhibitory effect of cholecystokinin on the sphincter of Oddi.\r"

Sixty animals were fed either low-fat (4.3%) or high-fat (20.25%) diet. Fifteen mice in each diet group were treated with L364,718 (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously twice daily for 23 days. On day 24 the animals were sacrificed. Tumor and animal pancreases were dissected and evaluated for weight, protein, and DNA content. When comparing within each diet group, L364,718 significantly decreased tumor volume, weight, protein, and DNA content compared to untreated mice (P less than 0.005). Tumor volume and protein content were significantly larger in untreated animals on the high-fat diet (P less than 0.05) compared to the low-fat diet. Mouse pancreatic weight, protein, and DNA content per kilogram of animal weight were all significantly lower (P less than 0.005) in mice on the low-fat diet treated with L364,718. Pancreatic DNA content was also decreased in both groups of animals on the high-fat diet compared to untreated mice on the low-fat diet. These findings suggest that diets high in unsaturated fat promote the growth of human pancreatic cancer. Since both tumor and pancreas growth are inhibited by the specific CCK-antagonist, L364,718, it is possible that endogenous CCK promotes the growth.\r"

In addition to delayed gastric emptying, which has hitherto been well known, the small bowel transit time was considered to be prolonged in patients with anorexia nervosa.

Intracerebroventricular injection of prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, did not alter basal water absorption. Prazosin did not prevent the clonidine effect. In contrast, the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, yohimbine, reduced basal absorption and prevented the intracerebroventricular clonidine effect. Treatment with reserpine reduced ileal norepinephrine content by 98%, reduced basal water absorption consistent with a loss of sympathetic outflow to the mucosa, but did not prevent the increase in water absorption due to intracerebroventricular clonidine. These results suggest that central alpha 2 receptors regulate water absorption by the rat ileum. The clonidine-induced increase in water absorption is not mediated by the sympathetic nerves innervating the intestine.\r"

Secretin stimulates the growth and affects the enzymatic composition of the stomach, small intestine, and pancreas in adult rats. This suggests a possible role for secretin in the rapid postnatal growth of these organs. We investigated this hypothesis by injecting rats subcutaneously with secretin (100 micrograms/kg) every 12 hr for seven days beginning on postnatal day 3, 6, 13, or 24. Growth parameters (weight, content of protein, DNA) as well as the composition of organ-specific enzymes of the stomach, small intestine, and pancreas were measured. Secretin increased growth parameters of the stomach and small intestine in a similar pattern, and in a quantitatively different fashion from that observed in the pancreas. Secretin's effects were also dependent on postnatal age for all organs studied. These data demonstrate that secretin can influence organ growth and enzyme composition of the stomach, small intestine, and pancreas of developing rats and may be one factor regulating growth and development of these organs.\r"

Three of nine patients who had gastroesophageal reflux without Barrett's esophagus had evidence of duodenogastric reflux, a frequency not significantly different from either of the other groups. Gastroesophageal reflux of bile and pancreatic enzymes, in addition to gastric acid may contribute to the greater esophageal damage often seen in Barrett's esophagus.

In the remaining seven, gastric cancer was given on the death certificate, but the details were unknown. When the data on gastric ulcer initially diagnosed were reevaluated, gastric cancer was suspected or could not be completely ruled out in seven of the nine in whom gastric cancer was detected at the same site. In the remaining two, a diagnosis of benign ulcer was made even when the initial data were reviewed. In these two, however, there was the possibility that the initially diagnosed gastric ulcer represents a phase of the \"malignant cycle.\" The number of deaths from gastric cancer in patients with gastric ulcer was significantly low, compared with that expected and computed by the age- and sex-matched general population.

PEA at dose levels of 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the severity of alcohol-induced lesions following oral, but not parenteral, treatment. The duration of protection with PEA was approximately 90 min, with maximum protection observed when PEA was administered 15-30 min before alcohol. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not prevent or reduce the protection induced by PEA. Other sympathomimetic amines such as isoproterenol and ephedrin were similarly cytoprotective against absolute ethanol while amphetamine, phenylephrine, and epinephrine proved ineffective. These results add further support to the role of the sympathetic nervous system in regulating gastric mucosal protection in the rat.\r"

The UES resting pressure showed large intrasubject day-to-day variations; however, mean values did not differ.

Ten minutes after the liquid meal, more than 50% of the meal had emptied from the stomachs of portal hypertensive rats while only one third of the meal had cleared in the control group (P less than 0.02).

  ".W": "To confirm that trypsin activity is a most important initiating factor in closed duodenal loop pancreatitis in rats, we observed the course of acute pancreatitis when trypsinogen activation was inhibited by intraduodenal infusion of a potent synthetic trypsin inhibitor (TI, nafamostat mesilate) but the other conditions were left unchanged. Intraduodenal and intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation was inhibited for 16 hr after the intraduodenal infusion of the inhibitor, although elevation of serum amylase and immunoreactive trypsin and pancreatic trypsinogen remained similar both in the TI and control groups. The mortality decreased from 44% (control) to 4% (TI) at 48 hr after establishing the model. Active trypsin in duodenal reflux is an initiating factor for further development of acute pancreatitis in the closed loop model, and inhibition of the initial activation of trypsinogen has a favorable effect on acute pancreatitis even if other deleterious factors remain unchanged.\r"

  ".W": "Homocysteine thiolactone (HTL) elicits seizures in mice at a dose of 850 mg/kg (95-100% of animals) with an average latency time of 19.5 min. These seizures are reversed by both 5' N-ethylcarboximide adenosine (NECA) and flunitrazepam, with respective ED50 doses of 0.025 and 0.20 mg/kg. NECA was approximately four-fold more potent as an inhibitor of HTL-induced seizures than of seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 75 mg/kg). Flunitrazepam was equipotent in both seizure paradigms. The purine precursor 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside, (AICAr), although virtually ineffective against PTZ-induced seizures at doses greater than 1 g/kg, was able to inhibit HTL-induced seizures with an ED50 of approximately 350 mg/kg. The anticonvulsant effect of AICAr was dose and time dependent. The anticonvulsant potency of AICAr was increased by simultaneous administration of the adenosine uptake blocker Mioflazine, whereas the central nervous system (CNS)-impermeable adenosine uptake blocker dipyridamole had no effect. The ability of AICAr to permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is limited (less than 1%) and may explain its low potency as an anticonvulsant. AICAr also has very low potency at brain adenosine A1 and A2 receptors as well as adenosine uptake sites (IC50 greater than 10(-3) M), suggesting that its anticonvulsant properties are not mediated by direct action at these sites. The results indicate that AICAr does have frank anticonvulsant effects and further suggest that HTL-induced seizures may represent a useful paradigm for evaluation of adenosinergic agents. AICAr or more potent derivatives thereof may represent a new class of anticonvulsants with the ability to target seizure foci selectively.\r"

Half of the epilepsy-prone group were exposed to seizure-inducing sound twice daily for 3 weeks. Food intake and weight gain were monitored for each animal. Genetically epilepsy prone rats with induced seizures consumed significantly less food and gained less weight than did the epilepsy resistant group. Seizure prone rats without seizures consumed the same amount of food as the resistant rats but gained less weight than the resistant strain but more than the seizure-induced animals. Epilepsy-prone animals had significantly altered trace element concentrations in tissues as compared with the resistant animals independent of seizure induction. Brain and liver iron, liver copper, and brain and heart manganese levels were all significantly lower in the seizure-prone rats as compared with the seizure-resistant rats. In the seizure-prone rats, induction of seizures resulted in an increase in brain and heart zinc levels and a decrease in whole blood manganese levels. These results demonstrate that both genetic factors relevant to susceptibility to seizures and the seizures themselves are associated with changes in trace element concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that the absencelike seizures induced by gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) are secondary to the effect of this drug on body temperature was tested using the prodrug of GHB, gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). Dosages of GBL less than 400 mg/kg produced a consistent profound hypothermia associated with bilaterally synchronous spike-wave discharges (SWD), whereas higher doses were associated with a more complex effect on core temperature associated with an EEG pattern of burst suppression. The threshold dose for the hypothermia and SWD was the same, but the temperature changes occurred later and lasted longer than the SWD induced by GHB. Rats aged less than 28 days were less sensitive to the hypothermia but more sensitive to the SWD produced by GHB than adult animals. The antiepileptic drug (AED) ethosuximide (ESM), known to attenuate GHB-induced SWD did so, but had no effect on the hypothermia, whereas GHB-induced hypothermia, but not SWD, was blocked by raising the ambient temperature from 26 degrees to 32 degrees C. These data do not support the hypothesis that GHB-induced absencelike seizure activity is a result of the hypothermia produced by this drug. Rather they suggest that the SWD and hypothermia are caused by separate, independent mechanisms.\r"

After the completion of primary site amygdaloid (AM) or hippocampal (HIPP) kindling, the hypothalamic defensive behavior threshold showed a +/- 20% fluctuation from the prekindling baseline with a mean tendency for reduction as in the control animals. The flight behavior threshold increased in the kindled animals, and decreased in the controls; however, the degree of change was not statistically significant. In contrast, the mesencephalic defensive behavior threshold, which was quite stable in the controls, decreased significantly upon primary (mean -13.5%) and secondary site (mean -22.2%) AM kindling, whereas the flight and screeching (sound emission) behavior threshold remained unchanged throughout kindling. The decreased or unchanged thresholds for each behavior were independent of the timing of the hypothalamic/mesencephalic stimulation after kindled generalized convulsion. The decreased mesencephalic defensive behavior threshold persisted during a 1- to 3-month rest period without kindling stimulation. These findings suggest that acquisition of feline AM-kindled seizure susceptibility is associated with a lasting facilitation of midbrain (but not hypothalamic) excitability for defensive (but not flight) behavior.\r"

The rate of initial diagnosis (first attendance rate) of non-provoked seizures was calculated as 34 in 100,000.

The most common type of seizure was partial seizure, accounting for 60%. If seizures with rapid generalization and a known focal lesion are included, the number increases to 72%. A diagnostic delay greater than or equal to 1 year was found in 16%, mainly a patient delay. A cause for the epileptic seizure was found in 49%. A cerebrovascular disease was most common (21%). Brain tumors were found in 11% and trauma in 7%. A cause was more often identified in the older age groups. There was no significant difference between the sexes in the proportion of identified causes.\r"

In this system, midazolam (MDL), a water-soluble benzodiazepine, was compared with diazepam (DZP), a sparingly soluble agent which is widely used to treat status epilepticus (SE) in humans. Both agents were administered intramuscularly (i.m.) in approximately equieffective doses in animals exhibiting clonic seizure activity. MDL proved to be about twice as potent as DZP. Whereas control animals convulsed for a period of approximately 90 min, those treated with DZP 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg convulsed for 7.8 and 3.9 min, respectively; mice receiving MDL 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg convulsed for 1.9 and 1.4 min, respectively. MDL arrested seizures substantially more rapidly than diazepam (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that MDL has sufficiently rapid anticonvulsant action to merit evaluation for control of SE in humans when a rapidly absorbed antiepileptic drug (AED) is needed and intravenous (i.v.) administration is not feasible.\r"

All drugs were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.), and the protection offered by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was expressed as ED50 in mg/kg. Caffeine sodium benzoate in doses of 0.0595-0.476 mmol/kg (11.55-92.4 mg/kg) distinctly reduced the anticonvulsant efficacy of PB, in the highest dose tested with an increase in ED50 value from 19.5 to 38 mg/kg. This methylxanthine derivative in the dose range of 0.119-0.476 mmol/kg (23.1-92.4 mg/kg) also efficiently inhibited the protective action of PHT. When combined with caffeine (0.238 and 0.476 mmol/kg), the ED50 of PHT was raised from 12 to 17 and 24 mg/kg, respectively. In doses of 0.238 and 0.476 mmol/kg, caffeine also diminished the efficacy of CBZ and VPA, and at the highest dose tested the methylxanthine elevated the respective ED50s from 13 to 20.5 mg/kg and from 270 to 420 mg/kg. Generally caffeine sodium benzoate (up to 0.476 mmol/kg) did not affect the plasma levels of studied AEDs, and only at 0.476 mmol/kg did it significantly decrease the level of PHT. Among the other methylxanthines, pentoxifylline (0.238-0.476 mmol/kg; 66.3-132.5 mg/kg) and diprophylline (0.952 mmol/kg; 242.1 mg/kg) inhibited the protective potential of PHT and the respective ED50s were raised from 12 to 16.5, 15.5, and 14 mg/kg. No significant alterations in PHT plasma levels were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During the preoperative period, in 19 of 20 patients, omeprazole 60 mg administered as an IV bolus every 12 hours inhibited acid output to less than 5 mEq/h measured in the last hour before the next dose of drug. In one patient, acid output was 25 mEq/h 12 hours after omeprazole, 60 mg, and increasing the dose to 100 mg every 12 hours reduced acid output to less than 5 mEq/h. During the operative and postoperative periods, IV omeprazole controlled gastric acid hypersecretion in all patients for up to 15 days. During this time, all patients received the dose determined preoperatively. No patient developed any clinical, hematological, or biochemical toxicity that could be attributed to omeprazole therapy during the preoperative or postoperative period. The present study demonstrates that omeprazole administered by IV bolus is safe and effective for controlling gastric acid hypersecretion. In contrast to IV histamine H2-receptor antagonists, IV omeprazole has the advantages of not requiring continuous infusion or postoperative dose adjustments. Intravenous omeprazole will become the drug of choice in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome undergoing surgery.\r"

However, renal tubular reabsorption is increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Therefore, it was hypothesized that decreased serum phosphate levels in spontaneously hypertensive rats may be related to a decrease in the intestinal transport of phosphate. To test this hypothesis, sodium-dependent phosphate uptake by jejunal brush-border membrane vesicles of spontaneously hypertensive rats and genetically matched Wistar-Kyoto rats was determined. Phosphate uptake consisted of two components: sodium-independent passive diffusion across the brush border and sodium-dependent, carrier-mediated uptake. The initial rate of uptake in spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats was linear up to 20 seconds. The initial rate and time course of jejunal sodium-dependent phosphate uptake was decreased in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with corresponding mean values in Wistar-Kyoto rats. This decrease was secondary to a decrease in Vmax rather than Km, suggesting tha the number and/or the activity of the sodium-phosphate transporters is decreased. Sodium-dependent phosphate uptake was pH dependent, with greater uptake at pH 6.0 than at pH 7.4. However, uptake values were lower in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats at all pH levels tested. In contrast, sodium-dependent phosphate uptake in weanling rats (prehypertensive state) was not significantly different between spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Vitamin D deficiency in both spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats decreased Vmax and Km of sodium-dependent phosphate uptake, whereas 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 administration increased Vmax and Km in both spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results suggest that the hypophosphatemia seen in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats is secondary to a decrease in sodium-dependent phosphate uptake compared with controls. The sodium phosphate transporter in spontaneously hypertensive rats is responsive to vitamin D administration.\r"

After an initial 12-week course of treatment, 87% of the patients had improved by at least one grade of inflammation (improvement), and 54% of these were asymptomatic with normal colonic mucosa (remission). Overall, there was an 80% remission rate by 34 weeks. Remission rate was not affected by extent of sigmoid or left-sided colon disease before treatment or prior medication use for ulcerative colitis. Treatment with mesalamine enemas allowed patients to decrease or discontinue glucocorticoid treatment. Patients treated for relapse episodes responded as well as they did to the first course of treatment, whether the relapse occurred after discontinuation of mesalamine or during a tapering of the dose. In conclusion, extending mesalamine treatment to at least 34 weeks was beneficial in inducing a complete remission in 80% of patients unresponsive to conventional therapy.\r"

  ".W": "To further define the role of mast cells in the idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, mediator release from intestinal mast cells derived from actively inflamed and relatively quiescent areas of ulcerative colitis was studied. It was hypothesized that mast cells in the actively diseased segments would indicate involvement in the disease process by releasing a different profile of mediators than cells in uninflammed tissue. Mast cell-containing suspensions derived from matched segments of 12 ulcerative colitis specimens were compared for responsiveness to the mast cell stimulus goat anti-human immunoglobulin E. Supernatants from challenged cells were analyzed for levels of three mast cell mediators, histamine, prostaglandin D2, and the sulfidopeptide leukotriene C. Mast cells from the actively involved areas released significantly greater amounts of histamine, prostaglandin D2, and sulfidopeptide leukotriene. The difference in histamine release was not a result of greater stores of histamine in the active tissue cells, because the total histamine content of the mast cells from the active areas was not significantly greater. The enhanced release of both preformed and newly generated mediators indicates activation of those cells in the course of the disease and points to the mast cell contribution to the inflammatory process in these disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The aims of this study were to assess gastric emptying, small bowel transit and colonic filling in patients with motility disorders, with particular attention to the patterns of colonic filling. Gastrointestinal transit was assessed using a previously validated radiolabeled mixed meal. Fourteen patients with clinical and manometric features of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction & classified as intestinal neuropathy and 6 as intestinal myopathy, were studied. The results were compared with those from 10 healthy controls studied similarly. Gastric emptying and small bowel transit of solids were significantly slower in both groups of patients than in healthy controls (P less than 0.05). In health, the ileocolonic transit of solid chyme was characterized by intermittent bolus transfers. The mean size of boluses transferred to the colon (expressed as a percentage of ingested radiolabel) was significantly less (P less than 0.05) in patients with intestinal myopathy (10% +/- 4% (SEM)] than in healthy controls (25% +/- 4%) or in patients with intestinal neuropathy (25% +/- 4%). The intervals between bolus transfer of solids (plateaus in the colonic filling curve) were longer (P less than 0.05) in myopathies (212 +/- 89 minutes) than in health (45 +/- 7 minutes) or neuropathies (53 +/- 11 minutes). Thus, gastric emptying and small bowel transit were delayed in small bowel neuropathies and myopathies. Bolus filling of the colon was less frequent and less effective in patients with myopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction, whereas bolus transfer was preserved in patients with neuropathic intestinal pseudoobstruction.\r"

  ".W": "It was hypothesized that low-molecular-weight products of carbohydrate fermentation would contribute only a small percentage to the total fecal excretion of nonfat, nonnitrogenous energy (carbohydrate energy) in premature infants. Infants born at 28-32 weeks' gestation who were 2-4 weeks of age were randomized to receive a formula with lactose as the sole carbohydrate (n = 7) or the same formula with 50% of the carbohydrate as glucose polymer (n = 8). The percent contribution (X +/- SD) to total carbohydrate energy of sugars (glucose, galactose, lactose, glucose polymer), short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, and isovalerate), and D- and L-lactate was 9.4% +/- 2.9% for the 15 subjects and was not significantly different between groups. The percent contribution of all four sugars was 5.8% +/- 1.7% and did not differ between the two groups. Doubling the lactose intake resulted in significant increases in fecal excretion (kilocalories per kilogram per day) of acetate (77% increase; P = 0.03), total short-chain fatty acids (54%; P = 0.04), and galactose (188%; P = 0.03). These data suggest that as much as 90% of fecal carbohydrate energy may be in the form of large-molecular-weight compounds, presumably bacterial in origin.\r"

  ".W": "The endocrine cells of the oxyntic mucosa of five patients with longstanding Zollinger-Ellison syndrome were quantitatively investigated with electron microscopy and two light microscopic methods (Grimelius and immunostaining for chromogranin A). Ultrastructurally, the volume density of endocrine cells was 3.2% +/- 1.1% of the mucosal epithelial component, a 168% increase (P less than 0.001) over the value found in normal subjects. Of the six endocrine cell types of human oxyntic mucosa, only enterochromaffinlike cells increased in cell density (65% +/- 15% of the total endocrine cell mass), size, and number of cell profiles per unit area. The enterochromaffinlike cells also underwent morphological changes of secretory granules with a decrease in vacuolated forms, increase in elongated profiles, and appearance of granules with a punctate structure of the core. The latter variety of granules was previously observed only in carcinoid tumors of the oxyntic mucosa and is possibly related to the enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia-neoplasia sequence seen in hypergastrinemic patients. A positive relationship was found between endocrine cell densities evaluated ultrastructurally and with chromogranin A immunostaining. It is concluded that in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, the trophic effects induced by longstanding hypergastrinemia are strictly selective for enterochromaffinlike cells and are associated with ultrastructural features typical for enterochromaffinlike cell tumors.\r"

To determine the prevalence of colonic lesions in cirrhosis of all types, cirrhotics evaluated for possible liver transplantation underwent combined pan upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. The patients were divided into two main groups, 248 with parenchymal liver disease (nonviral and viral) and 164 with cholestatic liver disease. The prevalence of the various colonic lesions identified was: polyps, 8.4%; nonspecific edema, 19.9%; inflammatory changes, 11.6%; hemorrhoids, 25.2%; and rectal varices, 3.6%. Normal findings were present in 42.4%. Except for an increased prevalence (P less than 0.05) of edema and a reduced prevalence (P less than 0.001) of inflammatory changes in the parenchymal liver disease group, the prevalence for all other lesions was similar in the two groups. Esophageal varices were present in most patients with hemorrhoids and in all with rectal varices. The degree of portal hypertension and/or disease severity was associated with hemorrhoids but not with rectal varices. The higher prevalence of inflammatory changes in the cholestatic group was because one fourth of this group had an inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Fc receptors in CCl4-induced liver cirrhosis in rats were studied by applying peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunoglobulin G complex as a ligand to the frozen sections. Intravenous injection of bovine serum albumin-antibovine serum albumin complexes or colloidal carbon was combined with histological staining for endogenous peroxidase, fibronectin, laminin, or a lectin, Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin I. In the cirrhotic process, sinusoidal Fc receptors showed a weakened reactivity to the ligand with focal absence, and the length of the Fc receptor-positive portion of the sinusoids in unit area decreased to about 50% of the normal value in the advanced cirrhosis. Fibronectin and the lectin showed the presence of sinusoids where Fc receptors were absent. The endothelium in Fc receptor-negative areas did not take up either immune complexes or carbon, and Kupffer cells were absent in these areas. A disturbed immune-complex metabolism was thus suggested to occur in association with the defect of sinusoidal Fc receptors in liver cirrhosis. These abnormalities appeared to not be directly related to perisinusoidal laminin deposition, i.e., capillarization of the sinusoid.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of taurocholate on transcytotic vesicular pathways labeled with horseradish peroxidase was assessed in isolated perfused rat liver preparations. Forty-five minutes after a horseradish peroxidase load in a recirculating system, continuous infusion of taurocholate but not taurodehydrocholate significantly increased horseradish peroxidase excretion in bile by 50% compared with controls. When horseradish peroxidase (25 mg) was pulse loaded for 1 minute in control perfusions, it appeared in bile in early (4-6 minutes) and late (20-25 minutes) peaks, the latter accounting for 90% of total horseradish peroxidase output. Taurocholate infusion significantly increased horseradish peroxidase output in both early and late peaks, whereas only a small increase in the early peak was observed with taurodehydrocholate. Colchicine pretreatment increased the early peak in bile but abolished the second peak. Electron micrographs from control livers revealed the accumulation of horseradish peroxidase-containing vesicles in pericanalicular regions at early (2 minutes) as well as late (18 minutes) periods. When a morphometric analysis of electron micrographs was performed from pericanalicular regions 2 minutes after a 1-minute pulse of horseradish peroxidase (500 mg), taurocholate but not taurodehydrocholate increased both the density and percent area of horseradish peroxidase-containing vesicles compared with controls. In contrast, colchicine pretreatment had no effect on the density of the early-appearing vesicles, although their individual sizes were reduced. Taurocholate but not taurodehydrocholate also increased the percent of tubular structures in the pericanalicular region. These findings indicate that taurocholate stimulates both early and late transcytotic vesicle pathways and therefore probably microtubule-independent vesicle pathway is present in hepatocytes that must be distinguished from paracellular routes.\r"

This issue was studied experimentally by match-feeding rats liquid diets of varying protein content with and without ethanol. Protein synthesis and enzyme secretion were investigated, because these parameters are believed to increase the capacity for pancreatic autodigestion. Protein synthesis was assessed by determining the incorporation of tritiated phenylalanine into trichloroacetic acid precipitated protein 10 minutes after IP injection and then corrected for the size of the precursor pool. Enzyme secretion was studied using pancreatic acini, which were prepared using clostripain-poor collagenase. Chronic ethanol feeding stimulated protein synthesis and lipase secretion and content in rats receiving adequate amounts of protein. These stimulatory effects of ethanol were markedly attenuated in rats administered protein poor diets. Protein deficiency per se significantly decreased the weight, protein, and enzyme content of the rat pancreas as well as increased the percentage release of lipase from acini. Although extrapolation from animal studies may be tenuous, the present findings may explain the link between nutrition and the occurrence of alcoholic pancreatitis.\r"

The hypothesis of diameter decrease proportional to treatment time was tested with data from 223 patients with radiolucent gallbladder stones up to 20 mm in diameter treated with 7-8 or 14-15 mg.kg-1.day-1 of either ursodiol or chenodiol for 1 year, followed up after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. Linearity of individual sets of data points was tested by mathematical and statistical methods, including polynomial curve fitting, linear regression analysis, quadratic vs. linear analyses of covariance, and prediction of 12-month stone size by linear extrapolation from diameters at 0 and 6 months. Most patients (greater than 70%) had rates of gallstone diameter decrease that were almost linear with treatment time, independently of different dissolution rates on a given regimen. Additional treatment time needed may be estimated from cholecystograms or ultrasonograms performed before treatment and after several months.\r"

Solid-phase gastric emptying studies showed severe gastroparesis in both patients. Upper endoscopies excluded gastric outlet obstruction. Gastric dysrhythmias (4-cpm and 1-cpm patterns) were recorded using cutaneous electrodes. An abdominal bruit was ascultated in one patient. Abdominal arteriograms in both patients showed total occlusion of all three major mesenteric vessels with collaterals supplied via hemorrhoidal arteries. Bypass grafting procedures of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries in one patient and of the celiac artery in the other patient were performed. Six months after mesenteric artery revascularization, upper gastrointestinal symptoms had resolved and original weights were regained. Furthermore, normal 3-cpm gastric myoelectrical activity and normal gastric emptying of solids were restored in both patients. In these patients, chronic mesenteric ischemia resulted in a novel and reversible cause of gastroparesis, gastric dysrhythmias, and accompanying symptoms.\r"

The hemangiomatosis was demonstrated by ultrasonography, computerized tomography, arteriography, and laparotomy with biopsy. When arteriovenous shunting became life-threatening and severe abdominal pain and cholestasis developed, the patient's name was placed on the waiting list for liver transplantation. However, after stopping the medication with metoclopramide, abdominal pain disappeared, cholestasis decreased, and the arteriovenous shunts in the liver closed completely. This course of disease represents either a spontaneous or a drug-induced activation and regression of hepatic hemangiomatosis. However, the long-term metoclopramide medication indicates a potential role of this drug in the promotion of hepatic angiogenesis. Hepatic angiomatosis in the adult seems to be neither a static nor a steadily progressive disorder but a process with active and regressive phases probably induced by a transient imbalance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors. Such a course should be kept in mind when major surgery or liver transplantation for hepatic hemangiomatosis is planned. It seems prudent to obtain a thorough drug history of all patients with hepatic hemangiomatosis. Whether hepatic hemangiomatosis can be drug induced or not, further investigation of the factors involved in hepatic angiogenesis is warranted.\r"

The effects of sensory denervation by capsaicin, indomethacin, atropine, guanethidine, and hexamethonium on laparotomy-induced protection were studied in the rat. Gastric mucosal injury was induced by the intragastric instillation of 1 mL of 75% ethanol. The laparotomy-induced protection against ethanol injury was abolished by sensory denervation by capsaicin (total dose, 125 mg/kg, SC) and also by pretreatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg, SC). In contrast, pretreatment with atropine (0.5 mg/kg, IP), guanethidine (total dose, 20 mg/kg, SC), or hexamethonium (20 mg/kg, IP) had no significant effect on laparotomy-induced protection. These data indicate that capsaicin-sensitive sensory afferent neurons, but not cholinergic or adrenergic autonomic neurons, mediate laparotomy-induced protection against ethanol injury. The hypothesis is put forward that the protective response to laparotomy arises from a somatovisceral and/or viscerovisceral axon reflex of capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons. Prostaglandins might play a mediator role in the activation by laparotomy of somatic and/or visceral branches of the afferent neurons.\r"

Insulinlike growth factor I receptors are widely distributed and structurally similar to insulin receptors. Frozen sections of rabbit gastrointestinal tract were incubated in buffer containing 40 pmol/L [125I]insulinlike growth factor I. Binding was saturable, temperature- and time-dependent, and reversible. Saturation binding experiments showed a single class of high-affinity receptors (Kd = 0.9 nmol/L, Bmax = 0.36 pmol/mg protein). The IC50s for insulinlike growth factor I and insulinlike growth factor II were 3 nmol/L and 90 nmol/L, respectively; whereas insulin at 1-3 mumol/L displaced 50% of specific binding. Autoradiography of insulinlike growth factor I binding demonstrated significant differences in receptor density in gastrointestinal smooth muscle, epithelium of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon. These results indicate that a single class of specific, high-affinity insulinlike growth factor I receptors were distributed in muscular and mucosal layers of the entire rabbit gastrointestinal tract. Insulinlike growth factor I is likely to be an important local mediator of intestinal growth and metabolism.\r"

The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of various doses of pancreastatin on gastric acid secretion in conscious dogs that were prepared with chronic gastric cannulas. Pancreastatin, administered IV at 400 pmol.kg-1 x h-1, enhanced peptone meal [peptone (5%), phenylalanine (90 mmol/L), glucose (12 g/dL)]-stimulated gastric acid secretion by 50%; pancreastatin at 800 pmol.kg-1 x h-1 enhanced peptone meal secretion by 165% (P less than 0.05). Intravenous administration of pancreastatin did not affect basal or peptone-stimulated release of gastrin. In addition, IV pancreastatin (400 pmol.kg-1 x h-1) failed to influence basal gastric acid secretion. Pancreastatin did not affect acid secretion stimulated by 2-deoxyglucose, histamine, or pentagastrin. The present study shows that pancreastatin can selectively enhance gastric acid secretion by a mechanism independent of cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin input.\r"

This study examined phenylthiocarbamide taste sensitivity in gastric and duodenal ulcer disease. The study sample included 164 patients with gastric ulcer, 134 with duodenal ulcer, and 299 community controls. Eight concentrations of phenylthiocarbamide in distilled water were obtained by binary serial dilution. The lowest concentration distinguished by taste from distilled water defined taste threshold. Bimodality of threshold distributions distinguished nontasters from tasters. Comparisons of patients with controls gave odds ratios of nontaste in gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer of, respectively, 0.7 (P greater than 0.1) and 1.3 (P greater than 0.03). The power of detecting at least a twofold difference between patients and controls in the odds of nontaste was 80%. Nontaste was more common in duodenal than in gastric ulcer patients (odds ratio = 2.0, P = 0.02). Taste sensitivity was unassociated with other genetic factors related to ulcer--ABO blood group, secretor status, and serum pepsinogen 1 level. The difference between gastric and duodenal ulcer patients in the ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide may be genetic; however, this study's inability, despite substantial power, to detect at least a twofold difference between patients and controls suggests that if phenylthiocarbamide taste sensitivity is a genetic factor in peptic ulcer, the relationship is weak.\r"

Measurements of airway flow, arterial oxygen saturation, and pulse rate were performed before and after intraesophageal infusion of sterile water, normal saline solution, and 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. Highly significant reductions in heart rate, airway flow, and arterial oxygen saturation were noted after infusion of normal saline and 0.1 N hydrochloric acid compared with baseline water infusion (P less than 0.001). Graded responses were noted with heart rate: the more acidic the solution infused, the larger the decrement of heart rate. Atropine abolished postsaline/acid decrements of airway flow, arterial oxygen saturation, and heart rate. It is concluded that acid-induced, vagally mediated esophagobronchial reflexes are present in humans.\r"

Luminal antigen caused an immediate increase in short-circuit current, a measure of net ion transport, which was one of three different patterns. All were inhibited by the chloride channel blocker diphenyl-2-carboxylate, by chloride-free buffer, and by doxantrazole, a mast cell stabilizer. Depending on the pattern, the histamine-1 antagonist diphenhydramine, the 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 antagonist ketanserin, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor piroxicam also reduced the responses. A neural component was indicated by inhibition of the responses to luminal antigen by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin and by neonatal capsaicin treatment, which depletes substance P-containing nerves. In the absence of antigen, histamine and substance P caused increases in short-circuit current; the magnitude of these changes was significantly greater in tissues from sensitized animals than in controls. These data suggest that sensitization itself may result in hypersecretory responses to some inflammatory mediator and neurotransmitter substances.\r"

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), prostaglandins, and the function of neuronal structures have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cholera. To elucidate the action of 5-HT in mediating cholera secretion, in vivo experiments were performed in the rat jejunum. The inhibitory effects of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 were studied in cholera toxin- and 5-HT-induced fluid secretion. Both ketanserin and ICS 205-930 dose-dependently but only partially reduced the secretory effect of cholera toxin. The combination of the two blockers totally abolished cholera toxin-induced secretion without any influence on cholera toxin-induced increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Prostaglandin E2- and bisacodyl-induced secretion was not affected by the combined administration of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 antagonists. The present results provide evidence for an important role of 5-HT in cholera toxin-induced secretion. The data suggest a model in which cholera toxin may initiate the release of 5-HT from enterochromaffin cells. 5-Hydroxytryptamine may then cause prostaglandin E2 formation via 5-HT2 receptors and activation of neuronal structures via 5-HT3 receptors. These two effects may finally lead to the profuse fluid secretion which can be totally blocked by the combination of a 5-HT2 blocker and a 5-HT3 blocker.\r"

Noninflamed tissues exhibited substantial amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium transport. In contrast, inflamed but structurally intact tissues exhibited only a modest degree of electrogenic sodium transport, significant increases in total tissue conductance and apical membrane conductance, and a 100% increase in the arachidonic acid content of the cell membrane fraction of mucosal homogenates. Replacement of chloride with gluconate decreased total tissue conductance to a greater extent in inflamed than in noninflamed tissues, and total tissue conductance was higher in inflamed than in noninflamed tissues in the presence of transepithelial potassium and sodium gradients, suggesting enhanced mucosal \"leakiness\" to anions and cations in acute colitis. Apical addition of nystatin virtually abolished amiloride-sensitive apical sodium uptake in both groups, indicating that the ionophore formed channels in the apical membrane of noninflamed and diseased mucosa. Additional studies showed that mucosal inflammation decreased maximal activity of the basolateral sodium pump by 76%. Thus, defects in the biophysical properties of colonic epithelial cell membranes are likely to be important factors in the pathogenesis of diarrhea in ulcerative and Crohn's colitis.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether late coronary restenosis may be predicted by abnormalities of myocardial perfusion in the early hours after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and to study in greater detail the mechanisms involved in the development of late coronary restenosis after angioplasty, a prospective study was undertaken in 90 consecutive patients. Thallium-201 scintigrams were recorded at rest and during the stress of atrial pacing, 12 to 24 h after angioplasty, and the results were related to the findings at angiography in 70 patients undergoing late cardiac catheterization. A reversible thallium-201 perfusion defect was found in 39 (38%) of 104 myocardial regions supplied by the dilated coronary vessel and identified a subset of patients at high risk of late (6 to 12 months) angiographic restenosis (sensitivity 77%, specificity 67%). In contrast, late coronary restenosis developed in only 7 (11%) of 65 vessels and in 5 (14%) of 37 patients with a nonischemic thallium-201 scintigram on day 1 (p less than 0.005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of 14 possible preangioplasty and periangioplasty clinical and angiographic variables selected reversible perfusion defect on the thallium-201 scintigram on day 1 (p = 0.016) and immediate postangioplasty residual coronary narrowing (p = 0.004) as significant independent predictors of late restenosis, with younger patient age as an additional less powerful predictor (p less than 0.05). The findings have important implications regarding the pathogenesis of late coronary restenosis in patients undergoing successful angioplasty and they imply that in the majority of these patients pathophysiologic events in the early minutes and hours after angioplasty may determine the development of late restenosis.\r"

Patients were subdivided into five groups based on age at the time of surgery: 20 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69 and greater than or equal to 70 years. The observed death rate was compared with that expected for subjects from the general U.S. population matched for age, gender, race and calendar year. For patients less than or equal to 59 years of age, the ratio of observed to expected death rates was significantly greater than unity (observed/expected = 4.9 for ages 20 to 39, 1.9 for ages 40 to 49 and 1.3 for ages 50 to 59 years, p less than 0.01). The prevalence of risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and cigarette smoking, was evaluated in the different age subgroups. When patients were subdivided on the basis of history of cigarette smoking, the decreased relative survival rate of younger (less than 60 years old) patients existed only in those who smoked (observed/expected = 6.0 for ages 20 to 39, 2.2 for ages 40 to 49 and 1.4 for ages 50 to 59 years). In nonsmokers, observed/expected ratios for every age group were not significantly different from unity. Thus, the reduced relative survival rate of younger patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be attributed to the interactive harmful effects of cigarette smoking.\r"

Twelve patients demonstrated 19 episodes of transient left ventricular dysfunction (greater than 0.05 decrease in ejection fraction, lasting greater than or equal to 1 min), with no change in heart rate. Only two episodes in one patient were associated with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes. The baseline ejection fraction was 0.52 +/- 0.12 in patients with transient left ventricular dysfunction and 0.51 +/- 0.13 in patients without dysfunction (p = NS). At follow-up study (19.2 +/- 5.4 months), cardiac events (unstable angina, myocardial infarction or death) occurred in 8 of 12 patients with but in only 3 of 21 patients without transient left ventricular dysfunction (p less than 0.01). During submaximal supine bicycle exercise, only two patients demonstrated a decrease in ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.05 at peak exercise; neither had a subsequent cardiac event. These data suggest that transient episodes of silent left ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge in patients treated with thrombolysis after myocardial infarction are common and associated with a poor outcome. Continuous left ventricular function monitoring during normal activity may provide prognostic information not available from submaximal exercise test results.\r"

  ".U": "90264591\r", 
  ".W": "The disease entity \"diabetic cardiomyopathy\" has been extensively described in young patients with diabetes in the absence of ischemic, hypertensive or valvular heart disease. The most convincing data have been a 30% to 40% incidence of decreased radionuclide angiographic left ventricular ejection fraction response to dynamic exercise. In the current study, the hypothesis was tested that this abnormal ejection fraction response was due to alterations in ventricular loading conditions or cardiac autonomic innervation (extrinsic factors), or both, rather than to abnormalities in intrinsic ventricular systolic fiber function (contractility). Twenty normotensive patients with diabetes (mean age 30 +/- 5 years, mean duration 15 +/- 6 years) and 20 age-matched normal subjects were studied. All patients with diabetes had a normal treadmill exercise tolerance test without evidence of myocardial ischemia. By radionuclide angiography, all normal subjects increased ejection fraction with exercise (62 +/- 4% to 69 +/- 6%; p less than 0.001). In contrast, 11 (55%) of 20 patients with diabetes maintained or increased ejection fraction with exercise (group 1; 62 +/- 4% to 69 +/- 6%; p less than 0.001) and 9 (45%) of 20 showed an exercise-induced decrease (group 2; 73 +/- 4% to 66 +/- 6%; p less than 0.001). No difference in the incidence of microangiopathy, as noted by funduscopic examination, was present between the diabetic groups. Despite the abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise in the group 2 patients with diabetes, all patients with diabetes had a normal response to afterload manipulation, normal baseline ventricular contractility as assessed by load- and heart rate-independent end-systolic indexes and normal contractile reserve as assessed with dobutamine challenge. Autonomic dysfunction did not explain the disparate results between the group 2 patients' radionuclide angiographic data and their load-independent tests of ventricular contractility and reserve. In addition, the high ejection fraction at rest in group 2 patients (73 +/- 4% versus 62 +/- 4% for normal subjects; p less than 0.001) was not related to the abnormal tests of autonomic function. Thus, when left ventricular systolic performance was assessed by load- and rate-independent indexes, there was no evidence for cardiomyopathy in young adult patients with diabetes who have normal blood pressure and no ischemic heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Sudden unexpected death can be the first clinical manifestation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is the most devastating feature of the natural history of the disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy appears to be an important determinant of many clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but the relation between its magnitude and the occurrence of sudden cardiac death has not been clearly defined. In this study, the magnitude of hypertrophy was assessed with two-dimensional echocardiography in 29 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who subsequently died suddenly or experienced cardiac arrest with documented ventricular fibrillation. Findings were compared with those obtained in a control group of 95 patients of similar age and symptomatic state. Maximal left ventricular wall thickness was significantly greater in patients with sudden death (26 +/- 7 mm) than in control patients (21 +/- 5 mm, p less than 0.001). Left ventricular wall thickness index, a quantitative expression of the overall extent of hypertrophy, was also greater in patients with sudden death (76 +/- 20 mm) than in surviving control patients (62 +/- 13 mm, p less than 0.001). Particularly marked and diffuse hypertrophy, with maximal wall thickness greater than or equal to 30 mm or wall thickness greater than or equal to 25 mm in two or more of the four segments into which the left ventricle had been divided, was eight times more common in patients with sudden death (11 [38%] of 29) than in control patients (5 [5%] of 95, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After labeling for 24 h, cells were irradiated with ultraviolet light (wavelength 365 nm, energy densities ranging from 30 to 1,200 mJ/cm2). Twenty-four hours after photoradiation, 80% of smooth muscle cells from nonatherosclerotic arteries and only 20% of smooth muscle cells from atherosclerotic plaques were viable and still adherent. Moreover, dynamic cell and cytoskeletal alterations in response to irradiation are described. The differential sensitivity of smooth muscle cells from nonatherosclerotic arteries and from atherosclerotic plaques provides evidence that a photodynamic treatment might be a valuable therapeutic approach to vascular stenosis.\r"

Mean plasma levels (+/- standard error) of a neutrophil elastase-derived fibrinopeptide (B beta 30-43) measured by a specific radioimmunoassay were fivefold higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction (877 +/- 337 pmol/liter, p less than 0.02) and 13-fold higher in patients with unstable angina (2,277 +/- 613 pmol/liter, p less than 0.006) as compared with control subjects (172 +/- 74 pmol/liter). Mean plasma levels of peptide B beta 30-43 in patients with stable angina (676 +/- 334 pmol/liter), although higher than in control subjects, were not significantly increased (p = 0.64).

Although total leukocyte counts in patients with unstable angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction were higher (p less than 0.01) than in patients with stable angina or in control subjects, elevations in peptide B beta 30-43 levels were independent of the differences in both leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count as well as in history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After angioplasty, the peak early to late velocity ratio increased from 0.89 +/- 0.2 to 1.05 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.0001) and the one-third filling fraction increased from 42 +/- 10% to 48 +/- 10% (p less than 0.0001). The percent atrial contribution to filling decreased from 45 +/- 7% to 41 +/- 8% (p less than 0.01), and the pressure half-time and the isovolumetric relaxation time shortened from 55 +/- 15 to 43 +/- 13 ms (p less than 0.001) and from 100 +/- 14 to 82 +/- 17 ms (p less than 0.0001), respectively. When comparing patients with complete (n = 23) and incomplete (n = 8) revascularization, the same changes in the Doppler variables were observed. However, the mean rate of acceleration of early filling increased significantly after angioplasty only in those patients with complete revascularization. These data indicate that the left ventricular diastolic filling pattern is modified significantly as early as 24 h after successful coronary angioplasty. Improvement in impaired relaxation appears to be the most likely explanation for these changes, although increased myocardial stiffness in patients with incomplete revascularization is an alternative hypothesis.\r"

  ".U": "90264602\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that Doppler echocardiographic methods based on the continuity equation can accurately determine aortic valve area in patients with clinically significant aortic stenosis; nonetheless, methods based on the continuity equation are time-consuming and may not be technically possible in all subsets of patients. The purpose of this study was to develop and prospectively evaluate a simpler new noninvasive method for determining aortic valve area. With this new method, aortic valve area is obtained by dividing the percent fractional anteroposterior shortening at the midventricular level by 4V2, where V is the peak instantaneous Doppler-derived flow velocity across the aortic valve. In the first part of the study, the fractional shortening-velocity ratio was used to examine a group of 25 patients evaluated retrospectively. There was a highly significant linear relation between the fractional shortening-velocity ratio (FSVR) and the aortic valve area (AVA) determined by the Gorlin formula at cardiac catheterization: FSVR = 1.1(AVA) - 0.1 (r = 0.88; significance of slope p less than 0.001). Furthermore, a fractional shortening-velocity ratio less than 1.1 reliably identified all patients with clinically significant aortic stenosis (aortic valve area less than 1 cm2), whereas a fractional shortening-velocity ratio less than 0.8 reliably identified all patients with critical aortic stenosis (aortic valve area less than 0.7 cm2). This new method was then validated by prospectively applying the fractional shortening-velocity ratio to a group of 44 patients from two separate institutions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No attempt has been previously made to relate this wall kinetic change and transmitral flow rate. In 25 normal subjects, 14 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (Group 1) and 17 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Group 2), M-mode echocardiographic studies were performed on the posterior wall and mitral valve. Transient values of mitral orifice area were calculated and transmitral flow velocities were recorded: area and velocity data yielded transmitral flow rates. Time intervals were determined from mitral opening to peak early area, velocity and flow rate and to posterior wall slope change. An additional group included five patients with a mitral prosthesis. The posterior wall slope change was present when part of the myocardial structures were almost akinetic or when mitral chordae tendineae were absent; slope change appeared as a regional phenomenon in the free wall. In the normal subjects, close values were found for the four time intervals. In the patients with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peak early velocity (95.7 +/- 16.7 and 146.2 +/- 31.4 ms, respectively), peak flow rate (84.7 +/- 18.2 and 137.4 +/- 29.5 ms) and time to slope change (91.4 +/- 18.6 and 133.6 +/- 32.7 ms) were significantly delayed (p less than 0.001) in comparison with peak area (56.6 +/- 9.5 and 84.3 +/- 22.5 ms). Slope change does not indicate the end of the early filling phase but, rather, its transition from acceleration to deceleration. Time to peak velocity or time to peak filling rate must be considered in a relaxation analysis.\r"

In nine hearts, 15 sustained ventricular tachycardias could be induced by programmed stimulation. In all hearts, mapping of epicardial and endocardial electrical activity during tachycardia was carried out. Histologic examination of the infarcted area between the site of latest activation of one cycle and the site of earliest activation of the next cycle revealed zones of viable myocardial tissue. In two hearts in which the time gap between latest and earliest activation was small, surviving myocardial tissue constituted a continuous tract that traversed the infarct. In three other hearts in which the time gap was large, surviving tissue consisted of parallel bundles that coursed separately over a few hundred micrometers, then merged into a single bundle and finally branched again. The direction of the fibers within the bundles was perpendicular to the direction of the activation front in that area. A similar type of inhomogeneous anisotrophy and activation delay was found in an infarcted papillary muscle removed from one of the explanted hearts and studied in a tissue bath during basic stimulation. Histologic examination of this preparation revealed that the delay was caused by a zigzag route of activation over branching and merging bundles of surviving myocytes separated by connective tissue.\r"

  ".U": "90264607\r", 
  ".W": "The chronotropic response to atropine is biphasic; low doses cause slowing of the sinus rate and high doses cause acceleration. Although it is accepted that atropine functions as a competitive antagonist at high doses, the mechanism of the negative chronotropic response at low doses is controversial. Specifically, it is unclear whether the effect is mediated centrally or peripherally. Since at the time of cardiac replacement all central nervous system connections to the heart are severed, the transplanted heart is a unique model for separating these effects. Graded doses of atropine sulfate (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 40.0 micrograms/kg body weight) were administered to 12 human heart transplant recipients to test the hypothesis that the bradycardiac effect of low dose atropine is centrally mediated. The baseline sinus cycle lengths of the decentralized donor and innervated native sinus nodes were 694 +/- 20 and 733 +/- 27 ms, respectively. At the 0.5 and 1.0 microgram/kg doses, the cycle lengths of the native sinus node increased by 29.1 +/- 13.5 and 23.1 +/- 14.2 ms, respectively. At the 2.0 micrograms/kg dose the sinus cycle length again shortened to control. At the maximal dose of atropine the sinus cycle length shortened by 138.3 +/- 29.7 ms compared with control. In contrast, the decentralized donor sinus node exhibited a flat dose response to atropine. High dose atropine (40 micrograms/kg) caused no change in the donor heart's atrial effective refractory period, corrected sinus node recovery time, or sinoatrial conduction time measured by either the Strauss or the Narula method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of pacing rate on the atrial strength-duration relation was determined in 10 patients at pacing rates between 125 and 300 beats/min to explore excitability over the range of rates used for permanent antitachycardia pacing systems. Two points that define the strength-duration curve were measured at each pacing rate: rheobase voltage--the lowest stimulus voltage that results in capture at a pulse duration of 2 ms; and chronaxie pulse duration--the threshold pulse duration at twice rheobase voltage. A permanent, tined, J-shaped pacing lead with a high current density and low polarization electrode was positioned in the right atrial appendage for cathodal stimulation. A constant voltage output, incorporating a fast recharge pulse designed to minimize electrode polarization, was used for stimulation. There was a significant increase in rheobase voltage (p = 0.009), chronaxie pulse duration (p = 0.001) and minimal threshold stimulus energy (p = 0.05) at pacing rates greater than 225 beats/min. A rheobase voltage greater than 5 V occurred in three patients at pacing rates greater than or equal to 275 beats/min. At a pacing rate of 300 beats/min, rheobase voltage had increased in 8 of 10 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-seven patients had supravalvular aortic stenosis: 11 required surgery after the first investigation and 8 (80%) of 10 others undergoing serial investigation showed an increase in the left ventricle to aorta pressure gradient. Angiographic measurements showed that the increase in the aortic pressure gradient was related to failure of normal growth of the ascending aorta lumen. Nineteen patients had pulmonary artery stenosis, with a right ventricular pressure greater than 33 mm Hg. At restudy, right ventricular pressure had decreased in 9 (82%) of 11 patients. This decrease in right ventricular pressure was associated with an increase in the systolic distensibility of the proximal pulmonary arteries, although there was no increase in the diastolic diameters. One patient had a rapid early increase in right ventricular pressure and no pulmonary artery growth. In two patients, multiple peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses became evident with time and produced persistent right ventricular hypertension. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is usually a progressive lesion, with an increase in left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient related to poor growth of the ascending aorta. Pulmonary artery stenosis usually improves and only rarely limits prognosis.\r"

Standard balloon valvuloplasty was performed through a 6F sheath inserted in the right carotid artery. The arteriotomy was repaired at the end of the procedure. Mean left ventricular systolic pressure was reduced from 142 to 97 mm Hg, with a decrease in mean peak systolic pressure gradient from 76 to 33 mm Hg. Only one patient developed mild aortic regurgitation. One patient with a hypoplastic left ventricle died, and one patient required open valvotomy. All four survivors have a normal carotid pulse and no neurologic sequelae. Two of these patients required repeat balloon dilation to treat residual aortic valve stenosis at 8 and 10 months of age, respectively. Balloon valvuloplasty using a carotid artery approach is feasible and was safe in five neonates with severe aortic valve stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects on cross-sectional area calculated with the continuity equation were assessed in canine experiments. In 13 open chest dogs, 46 supravalvular aortic stenoses were created by aortic root banding. The cross-sectional area of the stenosis was calculated by Doppler echocardiography with application of the continuity equation before and after the following hemodynamic interventions: protocol 1, atrial pacing at 90, 120, 150 and 180 beats/min after sinus node crush; protocol 2, preload reduction by mild and severe clamping of the inferior vena cava; and protocol 3, afterload augmentation by mild and severe clamping of the descending aorta. In each observation, a dimension of the stenosis was directly measured by two-dimensional echocardiography, and the cross-sectional area was determined as a reference standard. As a result of the hemodynamic interventions, significant changes were observed in stroke volume and pressure gradient (protocol 1), in cardiac output, stroke volume and pressure gradient (protocol 2) and in heart rate, cardiac output and pressure gradient (protocol 3). Despite these changes in hemodynamic variables, the Doppler-derived cross-sectional area showed no significant change for a given stenosis. In addition, areas calculated with the continuity equation (x) agreed well with those determined by two-dimensional echocardiography (y) (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001, y = 0.97x + 0.02, SEE = +/- 0.06 cm2). Thus, it is concluded that Doppler echocardiography with application of the continuity equation accurately predicts the stenotic cross-sectional area over a wide range of hemodynamic conditions in supravalvular aortic stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that either the cyclooxygenase inhibitor aspirin or the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist sulotroban exerts a direct myocardial effect that enhances myocardial salvage afforded by reperfusion. Accordingly, 21 anesthetized dogs underwent suture occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. At 2.5 h after occlusion, all dogs received intravenous streptokinase (20,000 U/kg body weight over 30 min) and were randomized to the following groups: group I (n = 7) received no additional treatment, group II (n = 7) received aspirin (5 mg/kg intravenously) and group III (n = 7) received sulotroban (10 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg per h intravenously). At 3 h after occlusion, the dogs underwent coronary reperfusion for the next 3 h. Myocardial infarct size as a percent of the hypoperfused zone was similar among dogs in group I (42 +/- 8%), group II (41 +/- 10%) and group III (45 +/- 11%). The incidence and the extent of myocardial hemorrhage were similar in all three study groups. Infarct size as a percent of the hypoperfused zone was significantly smaller in dogs without hemorrhage irrespective of treatment (35 +/- 9% versus 63 +/- 5%, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this article is to examine the specific dietary changes that 173 women made while participating in a feasibility intervention program to reduce their fat intake to approximately 20% of total calories over a 12-month period. The intervention program used group sessions to teach nutrition information and behavioral skills necessary to make a life-style dietary change. Four-day food records were collected from participants at the beginning of the study and again at 12 months. Women in the intervention group reduced their total fat intake from a mean of 76 gm (39% of total energy) to 31 gm (22% of total energy), mainly by decreasing their fat intake from milk products, red meats, and fats/oils. These women used cheddar cheese, American cheese, whole milk, butter, mayonnaise, salad dressing, bacon, and hamburgers less frequently, and used diet American cheese, low-fat cottage cheese, and skim milk more frequently. They consumed less fat in their vegetable dishes, and their total caloric intake from fruit increased slightly. In addition, the overall quality of the diets improved, since there was a 20% to 50% increase in the energy-adjusted intake of vitamins and minerals from food sources.\r"

Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between the estimates of usual individual intake from the questionnaire and estimates from the mean of three 4-day records obtained over a 1-year period, the mean of the two most recent records, and the record obtained 1 year after the start of the study. The results illustrate that the apparent validity of a questionnaire increases when it is compared with a greater number of 4-day food records. The correlations increased for most nutrients when the baseline food record was included, despite the fact that it was completed at a time not targeted by the questionnaire. These findings suggest that greater effort should be given to obtaining more diet-record days when validating other dietary assessment instruments.\r"

Parents of 55 preschoolers (mean age = 4.25 +/- 0.59 years) completed the recall and FFQ on two occasions 1 week apart. The recalls and FFQs were analyzed for energy, cholesterol, protein, total carbohydrate, calcium, sodium, potassium, and saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fats; each nutrient was expressed as raw value, value per kg body weight, and value per 1,000 kcal. Test-retest reliability estimates for the 24-hour recall indicated significant variability in reported total energy intake, but stable reports of intake were observed for one or all units of expression for polyunsaturated fats, cholesterol, protein, total carbohydrate, calcium, and potassium. The FFQ showed significant positive test-retest reliability estimates for all nutrients for all units of expression. Comparison of the recall and FFQ data showed similar percentages of intakes of energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein and significant correlations for reported intakes of cholesterol, protein, calcium, and potassium. Comparison of the recall and FFQ data with recall data from a comparable cohort showed lower reported intakes for our sample, with the exception of protein, carbohydrate, calcium, and potassium. If validation studies are successful, the FFQ may be useful in epidemiological studies of preschoolers' intakes over extended periods. The recall may prove to be a useful tool in the assessment of day-to-day variations in macronutrient intakes.\r"

  ".U": "90264625\r", 
  ".W": "Over a 2-year period, dietary and socioeconomic data were collected from 793 food records of 90 toddlers, aged 1 to 2 years, who were predominantly U.S. Hispanics living in low-income households in Denver, CO. This study was part of a larger investigation designed to assess the efficacy of vitamin and mineral supplements in young children. The toddlers were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups: multivitamin; multivitamin and iron; multivitamin, iron, and zinc; multivitamin and zinc; or placebo. Three-day food records that were collected from the toddlers at the beginning of the study, at 3 months, and at 6 months were used to assess the dietary and nutrient intakes. Meal patterns were devised on the basis of the frequency of food consumption and common food combinations. Nutrient values were calculated using a diet analyzer program. Nutrient analysis of the toddlers' diets indicated that iron and magnesium were consumed least frequently, whereas more than adequate amounts of protein (193% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance) and sodium (207% of minimum requirements for healthy persons) were consumed. No significant differences in nutrient intakes were observed among the treatment groups, suggesting that the vitamin and mineral supplements had no effect. A difference in energy intake was observed over time with the 6-month and 3-month intakes significantly higher than the initial intakes. There was also a high consumption of carbonated beverages. Despite the low income levels of the families, these toddlers were consuming adequate amounts of food; however, an educational component aimed at reducing the toddlers' high intakes of protein, sodium, and carbonated drinks may help improve the present feeding practices of the mothers.\r"

  ".W": "Elderly persons are reported to have low dietary intakes of vitamin B-6. Knowing which foods are the primary contributors of dietary vitamin B-6 may be useful to health professionals working to improve the nutritional status of the elderly. Therefore, we examined the contribution of five food groups--flesh foods (including all meat/fish/poultry), grains/cereals, legumes/nuts, fruits/vegetables, and dairy products/eggs--to dietary vitamin B-6 intake in 198 free-living elderly persons aged 60 years or older. Subjects were primarily Caucasian, low-income non-smokers; their mean age was 72 years. Mean dietary vitamin B-6 intake, determined from 3-day diet records, was 1.6 +/- 0.6 mg/day. The fruit/vegetable group was the largest dietary contributor of vitamin B-6 (0.69 mg/day). Flesh foods and cereals/grains contributed equally to the vitamin B-6 intake (0.35 and 0.34 mg/day, respectively). The lowest contributors were dairy products/eggs and legumes/nuts. Approximately 96% of the vitamin B-6 intake could be accounted for by the five food groups. Twenty percent of the population (no. = 39) consumed less than 66% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin B-6; their vitamin B-6 intake from fruits/vegetables and grains/cereals was 0.36 and 0.10 mg/day, respectively. Individuals with vitamin B-6 intakes greater than or equal to 100% of the RDA (no. = 69) consumed greater amounts of fruits/vegetables (primarily bananas) and grains/cereals (primarily breakfast cereal) than did persons who consumed less than 66% of the RDA for vitamin B-6; their vitamin B-6 intake from fruits/vegetables and grains/cereals was 0.98 and 0.55 mg/day, respectively. In the elderly population studied, plant foods were the major dietary contributors of vitamin B-6.\r"

Weight loss 3 to 12 months after transplant was experienced by 28%. Nutrition-related problems, changes in anthropometric indexes indicative of suboptimal nutritional status, and inadequate energy intake were observed more frequently in patients with extensive chronic GVHD than in patients without GVHD or in those with limited GVHD. Our findings indicate a high prevalence of nutrition problems among recipients of allogeneic marrow transplantation 1 year after transplant and, further, suggest the need for ongoing, community-based nutrition monitoring after discharge from a transplant center.\r"

The survey focused on the diet recommended for the first 21 days after successful transplantation. Questionnaires were mailed to 100 centers randomly selected from a comprehensive list obtained through the Organ Transplant Coordinating Office of the Texas Medical Center, Houston. A 66% response rate was obtained. The results of the survey showed that dietitians were most frequently recommending 1.2 to 1.5 gm protein per kg body weight, 40% to 50% of total energy as carbohydrate, a fat intake of less than 30% of total energy, and an energy level consistent with achieving or maintaining desirable body weight. Sodium intake was most commonly restricted to 2 to 4 gm, whereas potassium and phosphorus intakes were individualized according to the patient's serum values. Comments on the returned questionnaires indicated that many institutions were reviewing and updating their transplant diet to include a polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat ratio and restrictions of cholesterol and simple sugars. The findings of the survey indicated that the renal transplant diet should focus on optimal protein and energy intake as well as restriction of simple sugars, total fat, cholesterol, and saturated fat to restore nitrogen balance and minimize clinical symptoms of post-transplant diabetes and hyperlipidemia.\r"

Point-of-purchase nutrition intervention programs that identify specific foods in restaurants and grocery stores are particularly promising community-based strategies for providing that type of information. However, such strategies demand consistent criteria for determining which foods and/or products should be labeled. This article describes the process of developing and validating criteria and the subsequent uses of the criteria in community nutrition intervention programs. Steps in the process include (a) identifying the scientific basis for the criteria, (b) developing food-group-specific nutrient criteria based on a referent meal pattern, (c) developing the eligibility of single servings of specific foods for labeling based on the nutrient criteria of the food group to which the specific food belongs, and (d) validating the criteria by reviewing actual food products in the grocery stores and restaurants. We conclude that the use of criteria provides a consistent standard for evaluating specific foods and food items in nutrition evaluation programs.\r"

Immunization levels among children in the developing world have risen dramatically, and in some instances, now equal or exceed levels in industrialized nations. There is no room for complacency, however, because millions of children remain incompletely immunized and many die each year from measles, pertussis, and neonatal tetanus. Immunization activities need to be intensified, accelerated, and sustained within the context of the primary health care system. Expansion of immunization programs to include additional vaccines and other simple health interventions will yield further benefits in the years ahead.\r"

However, it has now been demonstrated that immunization against certain self substances to which tolerance normally exists can elicit beneficial effects to humans and other animals without inducing autoimmune disease. Clinical trials in women have been conducted with vaccines against reproductive antigens for the prevention of pregnancy and research is under way to develop more advanced formulations. Other self antigens have been described that might be used for developing methods of immunological therapy for such diseases as cancer, ulcers, and complications of diabetes. Emphasis is placed on the need for careful studies in appropriate animal models before any clinical application of such procedures is suggested.\r"

Zidovudine (AZT), recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4), and recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) were evaluated in 2- and 3-drug regimens against HIV-1 replication in vitro. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a CD4+ T cell line (H9) were studied using multiple HIV-1 replicative end points. Drug interactions were evaluated by the median-effect principle and the isobologram technique. AZT, rsCD4, and rIFN-alpha A inhibited HIV-1 synergistically in 2- and 3-drug combinations. The 3-drug regimen provided more complete virus suppression than the 2-drug regimens. In H9 cells, single-drug regimens lost effectiveness at 10-14 days and 2-drug regimens lost effectiveness at 14-18 days. In contrast, the 3-drug regimen showed nearly complete suppression over 28 days in culture without toxicity. Clinical trials of these 3 drugs in combination should be considered.\r"

Twelve samples (3.2%) were seropositive for HTLV-I; results for HIV-1 (101 [26.8%]) are reported elsewhere. HTLV-I prevalence increased with age, and seven of the seropositive women originated from the Equateur region, a remote area in northwestern Zaire. The prevalence among women from Equateur (7.2%) was higher than that of women from all other regions (1.8%, P = .02). Presence of HTLV-I antibodies was not associated with frequency or type of sex practice. In a subsequent study, 350 serum samples were obtained from a variety of subjects in the Equateur region in 1986. Nineteen (5.4%) showed antibodies to HTLV-I. These data and a recent report of a cluster of patients with tropical spastic paraparesis from this region suggest that HTLV-I is endemic in the Equateur region of Zaire.\r"

For children less than 5 years old, the acute case fatality ratio (CFR) was 9.6%. Compared with index cases who contracted measles in the village, secondary cases infected within the compound had a significantly higher mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-6.1). The CFR of secondary cases increased with the closeness of contact with the index cases; the ORs were 1.9 (CI, 0.6-6.0) for children living in the same compound but not the same household, 2.3 (CI, 1.0-5.7) for children living in the same household but not in the same hut, and 3.8 (CI, 1.7-8.4) for children living in the same hut. In large compounds with many cases, the CFR increased exponentially through the succession of generations; the ORs were 2.3 (CI, 1.0-5.2) in the second generation, 3.7 (CI, 1.1-3.0) in the third generation, 5.5 (CI, 1.7-18.1) in the fourth generation, and 16.1 (CI, 5.6-46.3) in the fifth or later generations. Postmeasles mortality through the year following measles infection was also significantly related to the intensity of exposure. Differences in exposure may be a major determinant of child survival, both at time of acute disease and for the long term impact of measles infection.\r"

The number of vesicles on the body correlated with the maximum body temperature, duration of fever, and number of infected cells in the blood. These results indicate that varicella zoster virus infection in immunocompetent children is disseminated by circulating T and B lymphocytes and the severity of the viremia is reflected in the severity of the disease.\r"

Male children were more frequent carriers of either HBs or e antigen than were female children. Marked clustering of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antigenemia within sibling relationships was shown in both villages. The chance of the youngest child in a household being a carrier of HBsAg was strongly related to the number of antigen-positive siblings. Four years later, 53% of children who were initially positive for HBsAg and 33% who were positive for hepatitis B e antigen still carried these antigens. Jaundice was not observed.\r"

The poor outcome of patients with persistently positive or fluctuating HDV RNA has been indicated by the following findings: 24 of 38 patients suffered from prolonged hepatic inflammation complicated by three to eight episodes of exacerbations; among them, 5 developed cirrhosis and 2 died in a follow-up period of 4 years. For most patients, the replication of HBV was suppressed at acute stage; only 3 of the 38 cases had detectable HBV DNA in sera. While reactivation of HBV was found in another 8 patients in the follow-up period, for 5 it was in the presence of serum HDV RNA and 2 developed cirrhosis. Therefore, serial assays of serum HDV RNA and HBV DNA appeared to be of value in monitoring the clinical course and outcome of acute HDV superinfection and in the study of the long-term interactions between these two viruses.\r"

Detection rates were compared among three age groups: 0-29, 30-59, and 60-89 years. Detection of JC viral DNA increased with age and reached the highest value (45%) in the group aged 60-89 years. For BK viral DNA a correlation between detection and age was not clear because the rate of detection was low, although the highest rate (9%) occurred in the oldest group. To confirm the active urinary excretion of polyomavirus DNA in older patients, urine specimens from 23 patients (60-90 years) treated at an internal medicine clinic were examined for viral DNA. BK and JC viral DNA were in 2 (9%) and 12 patients (52%), respectively. These results suggest that JC virus is frequently reactivated in older individuals.\r"

The slime-producing rho variants were methicillin-resistant and more virulent than methicillin-susceptible epsilon variants in an endocarditis model. With S. saprophyticus, phase variation was of higher frequency. Nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis produced a stable blue epsilon form that was more virulent than the parent in a mouse model of urinary tract infection. Mutants with the blue epsilon phenotype differed from gold epsilon parents in a variety of phenotypic properties, including increased resistance to oxacillin. These staphylococcal species have a high frequency of phase variation: Phase variants differ in antibiotic resistance and virulence, which is only partially correlated with suggested virulence factors such as slime production.\r"

For the susceptible strain and for the susceptible subpopulation of cells in the heterogeneous strain, growth inhibition correlated with binding to PBPs 1-3, suggesting that these PBPs mediate susceptibility in both. For resistant cells, growth inhibition correlated only with binding to PBP 2a, suggesting that this is the target in resistant cells.

The adherence of S. aureus to fibrinogen-coated catheters was blocked by goat anti-human fibrinogen antibody, but not fibronectin, vitronectin, or nonimmune goat IgG. Adherence to catheter tubings coated with fibrin did not differ markedly from that to those coated with fibrinogen alone, suggesting the conservation of the staphylococcal binding domain during the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Plasma proteins such as fibronectin or factor XIII that interacted with fibrin did not modify staphylococcal adherence to fibrin. Adherence studies with staphylococcal cells treated with proteinases revealed that staphylococcal surface protein(s) were responsible for fibrinogen binding.

Permeability changes were dose-dependent, began 12 h after inoculation, and reversed within 1 week. Only live, intravenously inoculated organisms produced impairment of the blood-brain barrier. A spirochetal strain-dependent effect was noted in that changes were more marked with a recent isolate than with a strain in long-term in vitro culture. Mild pleocytosis and spirochetes were noted in the cerebrospinal fluid of rats with increased blood-brain barrier permeability. This experimental evidence for early central nervous system invasion was pursued in studies of the human disease. Specific B. burgdorferi antigens could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with early Lyme disease by use of murine monoclonal antibodies as probes.\r"

In pretreatment samples, 35 patients (78%) showed B. burgdorferi-specific oligoclonal IgG in CSF indicative of intrathecal antibody production. At 2, 3-6, and 6 weeks after onset, respectively, such bands were present in 5 (42%) of 12, 21 (88%) of 24, and in all of 9 patients (100%). Up to 1 year after therapy, specific oligoclonal bands in CSF tended to remain unchanged despite clinical recovery. B. burgdorferi-specific oligoclonal bands in serum were found in 7 patients. These bands had identical migration patterns as in CSF, but were fewer in number and in some patients showed a temporal evolution different from their CSF counterpart. Not all oligoclonal IgG in CSF reacted with B. burgdorferi. The 41-kDa flagellar antigen was shown to be a major antigen in the intrathecal immune response. The demonstration of B. burgdorferi-specific oligoclonal IgG in CSF is a sensitive and reliable indicator of Lyme neuroborreliosis.\r"

Of 12 patients with putative late central nervous system manifestations of Lyme disease, 5 (42%) had local production of IgG or IgA spirochetal antibody, but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities could not be demonstrated in 6 patients with late peripheral nervous system manifestations of the disorder. Compared with American patients, 30 European patients with neuroborreliosis had significantly higher CSF:serum ratios of specific antibody both early and late in the illness. Intrathecal antibody determinations are the most specific diagnostic test currently available for Lyme neuroborreliosis, but local antibody production in CSF is an inconsistent finding in American patients with late neurologic manifestations of the disorder.\r"

A total of 77 cases were recorded. The incidence was 60 cases/100,000 children less than 5 years of age and 297 cases/100,000 children less than 1 year of age. The peak prevalence was at the age of 5 months; 83% of the children were less than 1 year old and 45% were less than 6 months old. Only 55% of cases recovered completely. The distance to the nearest hospital was an important predisposing factor for a fatal outcome. Two cases were secondary. Many patients were anemic and underweight. The observations show that H. influenzae meningitis in The Gambia has an incidence as high as that in the USA, but that it has 10-fold more devastating outcome. If the infection is to be prevented by vaccination in The Gambia, immunization will have to be given very early in life.\r"

Enzymatic digestion of the glycocalyx with dextranase enhances antibiotic activity. The effect of clindamycin (30 mg/kg, subcutaneous, three times daily) was studied in rabbits with experimental aortic valve endocarditis caused by high glycocalyx-producing viridans streptococci. Animals receiving clindamycin had smaller vegetations that were sterilized more quickly than did controls or animals receiving penicillin or dextranase alone (P less than .001). Penicillin plus dextranase treatment allowed greater bacterial killing than penicillin alone and did not differ significantly from clindamycin treatment. Electron micrographs revealed markedly less cell-adherent glycocalyx on organisms grown in vitro treated with clindamycin versus penicillin and controls. It is hypothesized that clindamycin inhibits glycocalyx production in vivo, allowing better antimicrobial penetration in the infected cardiac vegetation.\r"

The possibility that antibodies directed against TCP might block colonization and thereby potentially prevent infection was investigated. The pilus was purified and polyclonal antiserum raised against it was shown to react preferentially with the 20.5-kDa major pilin subunit, TcpA. This antiserum inhibited attachment of the bacteria to epithelial cells in vitro. In a cholera animal model system, these pilus-specific antibodies efficiently protected infant mice from challenge with virulent V. cholerae strains of different serotypes and biotypes. Western immunoblot analysis of available killed, whole-cell vaccine preparations using TcpA-specific antibodies failed to detect pilin in either preparation. The results suggest that inclusion of TCP in cholera vaccines would provide a common antigen to induce immunity to the strains associated with human infection and potentially increase vaccine efficacy.\r"

In developing countries the epidemiology of H. pylori has not well been described. A sensitive and specific serologic assay for H. pylori infection was validated in Thai patients also studied by culture and histologic examination of biopsy specimens. The prevalence of H. pylori antibodies in persons from a rural Thai community began early (17.5% of children 5-9 years old), increased to 55% during the third decade of life, and peaked (75%) in the 30- to 49-year age group. At a Bangkok orphanage where enteric infections are hyperendemic, 74% of children 1-4 years old were seropositive. This study shows that the prevalence of H. pylori infection in Thailand is higher than in industrialized countries. The high infection rate at the orphanage suggests that person-to-person transmission of H. pylori may be occurring.\r"

An outbreak of legionnaires' disease occurred at a retirement hotel; Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated from an evaporative condenser and from potable water. A case-control study showed that the only significant exposure risk was in area A. L. pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated during air sampling near the evaporative condenser exhaust site, the air conditioning intake vent, and an air vent in area A, but not in shower stalls. Monoclonal antibody subtype patterns of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 isolates from patients matched those from the evaporative condenser but not from shower water. Air sampling and monoclonal antibody subtyping results support epidemiologic evidence that the evaporative condenser was the source of this outbreak.\r"

Amikacin and gentamicin liposomes significantly reduced bacterial counts in blood, liver, and spleen (98.5%, 92.7%, and 92.8%, respectively, for the 1-mg dose of amikacin and 92.8%, 99.7%, and 99.4% for gentamicin; 95.7%, 69.7%, and 89.1%, respectively, for the 0.2-mg dose of amikacin and 49.9%, 76.7%, and 89.1% for gentamicin) compared with placebo liposomes and buffer. Equivalent doses of free drug were not associated with significant decreases in viable bacteria. Thus, aminoglycoside liposomes improved bactericidal effects over conventional treatment in disseminated MAC infection, offering potential application in treating MAC infection in humans.\r"

In the presence of 7.5 mmol/l urea, 25% of the cells showed vacuolization. With 30 mmol/l urea, the final pH was 7.6, indicating that vacuolization was not due to change of pH. The first report of vacuolization of tissue culture cells by H. pylori was in a system without added urea but with concentrated bacterial supernatant; 30% of H. pylori strains demonstrated a cytotoxic effect. In those experiments fetal calf serum was used; it contains 6 mmol/l urea but was used at a concentration of 10%. A urease inhibitor, acetohydroxamic acid, caused a 75% drop in the number of cells showing vacuolization, and ammonia caused vacuolization. Thus the urea of H. pylori probably causes this vacuolization.\r"

In both towns, house-to-house visits were used to screen for blood pressure, gather information about cardiovascular risk knowledge and behavior, and provide a cardiovascular educational program. Persons with elevated blood pressure were advised to seek follow-up. Additional interventions, carried out in the study town only, included ongoing follow-up for those with elevated blood pressure and their providers, and sliding-fee medical services for those with financial barriers to care. At rescreening 2 years later, residents of the study population had an adjusted systolic blood pressure 3.1 mm Hg lower than those in the control population (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.9, 5.3). Furthermore, those who were screened at both rounds had an adjusted systolic blood pressure 2.7 mm Hg lower than those who had not previously been screened (95% CI = 0.6, 4.8). Although knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors increased among those who were surveyed in both rounds, there was little demonstrable effect on cardiovascular risk behaviors. Difficulties were encountered in engaging the participation of all medical providers, and less use was made of the sliding-scale program than expected. While it appears feasible to implement the technical methodology of a COPC model in a rural setting, it is crucial to engage the support of the local and medical community.\r"

The system consists of organized identification, progress records, brief physician messages, follow-up, and assistance; it focuses on those most interested in quitting. Introduction of the system to one clinic was associated with an initial threefold to fivefold increase in quit rates of all clinic patients using tobacco. After 2 years, the overall quit rate was approximately 20%, rising to 33% for those tobacco users with more clinic contacts or at least 1 year from the first to the latest contact. Such a program has been well accepted by patients, physicians, and office staff and seems to provide the support needed for a feasible and effective long-term smoking cessation intervention in primary care practices.\r"

Six women (13%) had labor onset 1 to 16 hours after the initial gel placement, and an additional 19 women (42%) had labor onset within 48 hours of the final gel placement. Twenty-one women (47%) gave birth without the use of oxytocin, and only 11 women (24%) required oxytocin induction of labor. No significant differences were seen in type of delivery, delivery complications, or newborn outcome between categories of labor onset (spontaneous, PGE2 gel, oxytocin). Two complications followed gel insertions, one case of uterine hyperstimulation and one case of a brief episode of fetal bradycardia. Both women were identified within the monitoring period and subsequently were delivered of healthy term infants. This case series demonstrates the usefulness and lack of adverse effects of outpatient PGE2 gel as an adjunct in labor induction.\r"

This study evaluated one such instrument, the Ames Seralyzer, and compared the findings with those of the Du Pont aca. Forty-six patient samples were split and run on both instruments by trained laboratory personnel. Validation studies yielded a correlation coefficient of r = .9680 (N = 46). Precision assays showed the 27.5 and 82.5 mumol/L (5 and 15 mg/L) levels of theophylline found in control samples produced day-to-day coefficients of variation of 8.8% (n = 43) and 5.8% (n = 35), respectively. After initial evaluation of the Seralyzer, duplicate assays were performed because of erratic results. The evaluators felt that a major source of error was in the diluting and pipetting steps involved in the procedure. The Seralyzer was easy to run but did require some technique-dependent skills.\r"

A one-page questionnaire was administered in the classroom to 276 of 300 children in grades 4 through 8 of an upper middle class suburban school district. The children were questioned regarding their knowledge of three basic bicycling rules of the road, prior bicycle safety instruction, use of bicycle helmets, and the occurrence and severity of previous bicycle accidents. Students who reported receiving previous bicycle safety instruction were more knowledgeable than those receiving no instruction regarding rule 2, always stop at a stop sign or red light (90% compared with 74%), and rule 3, always stop and look when approaching a street from a driveway or alley (74% compared with 60%). Students who did not know rule 3 were more likely to have had a recent bicycle accident in which their bicycle was damaged (21% compared with 8%) and to have ever gone to the hospital or a physician because of injuries sustained in a bicycle accident (19% compared with 9%). Children who lacked knowledge of basic bicycling rules were more likely to have had a significant bicycling accident. Bicycle safety instruction increases children's knowledge of these rules and should be promoted by physicians caring for children.\r"

Included in the study were 139 women over 50 years of age who had been residing in a skilled nursing home in Connecticut for at least 1 year. Charts were reviewed to estimate screening mammography and chest x-ray examination use. Functional status of each subject was assessed by supervisory nurses using set criteria. One of the 139 subjects had received a mammogram, whereas 129 subjects (93%) had received chest x-ray examinations. Average length of stay in the nursing home was 6.5 years. No association was noted between functional status and use of mammography. It was concluded that in this clinical setting mammography appears to be underutilized as a screening test for breast cancer. The comparative data on chest x-ray examination use suggest strategies that may be useful in increasing compliance with current screening recommendations for mammography in the institutional setting.\r"

However, it has not been determined whether the endotoxin itself has a direct effect on these renal functions. To test whether endotoxin has a direct renal effect, isolated rat kidneys (N = 8) were perfused for 160 minutes with a Krebs-Ringer-HCO3- solution containing substrate-free albumin (40 g/liter), glucose (5 mM) and L(+) lactate (7.5 mM). After control observations (20 to 80 min) were made, purified LPS from E. coli was added (N = 4) to the perfusate to achieve [endotoxin] of 0.01 micrograms/ml (80 to 120 min) and 0.1 micrograms/ml (120 to 160 min). Endotoxin had no effect on GFR, Na+ reabsorption or tissue K+ content when compared to timed-control perfusions (N = 4). There was a small (approximately 10%) but significant decrease in mean perfusion flow rate (PFR) at the highest [endotoxin] when compared to the low [endotoxin]p but no change in GFR occurred. When the same LPS was given to four rats in vivo at a dose which achieved an [endotoxin] of approximately 0.08 micrograms/ml plasma, there were prompt decreases in GFR and %T-Na+ and an increase in body temperature when compared with timed-controls; there also was a large loss of K+ from the kidney tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We microscopically examined the narrow segment of the efferent arteriole (NSEA) in the hydronephrotic kidney of rats in vivo. This segment is routinely found at the proximal efferent arteriole adjacent to the glomerulus and is characterized by a narrowing due to a cellular structure which bulges into the lumen. The existence of NSEA has been described in a previous study from our laboratory, but it was not examined in detail; its functional behavior in particular is still unknown. In the present study, we measured changes in luminal diameter of NSEA during reduction of renal perfusion pressure and in response to angiotensin II (Ang II), saralasin, and nitroprusside. The mean luminal diameter of NSEA at its narrowest point was 5.1 microns and its effective length was 8.4 microns. Reduction of renal perfusion pressure from 115 to 90, 70, and 40 mm Hg decreased NSEA diameter by 9, 15, and 23%, respectively. Topical application of saralasin (10(-5) M) or nitroprusside (10(-4) M) to the kidney dilated NSEA by 10 or 20%, respectively, and attenuated the pressure-dependent constriction of NSEA. Intravenous infusion of Ang II at rates of 50, 100, 200, and 400 ng/min/kg constricted NSEA lumen by 7, 15, 20, and 21%, respectively. The vascular bed of the hydronephrotic kidney was scanned morphologically, and a mathematical model was developed from these data. With this model, we could calculate the effect of segmental diameter changes on total renal resistance as well as flow and pressure at different vascular levels. NSEA contributed 4% to the total renal resistance and 20% to the efferent resistance under control conditions. Lowering of renal perfusion pressure increased the efferent arteriolar resistance up to 50% above the control value mainly as a result of constriction of NSEA. Our data indicate that efferent resistance increases at reduced renal perfusion pressure and leads to a stabilization of glomerular pressure. The rise of efferent resistance is mediated primarily by NSEA constriction, and the renin-angiotensin system is involved in this regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the hematocrit (Hct) on the trapping of red blood cells (RBC) in the renal microvasculature and its effect on the long-term outcome following unilateral ischemia were investigated in the rat. The results showed that an increase in the duration of ischemia increased the RBC trapping, as measured by 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner. At normal Hct (46%) the period of ischemia producing half-maximum RBC trapping was 45 minutes, whereas after hemodilution (Hct = 31%) or hemoconcentration (Hct = 60%) the corresponding periods were 80 and 25 minutes, respectively. Regarding the long-term outcome, 45 minutes of ischemia with a normal Hct was associated with a marked decrease in kidney weight, GFR and urine osmolarity after four weeks of recovery, which could be prevented to a large extent by hemodilution. Conversely, with hemoconcentration there was severe damage after only 25 minutes of ischemia. It is suggested that these long-term effects are attributable to RBC trapping in the microvasculature of the outer medulla, which may cause added ischemia in this area of the kidney. It is also suggested that cortical atrophy is secondary to the medullary injury, and is brought about to avoid extensive water and salt losses.\r"

Furosemide added to the bath fluid decreased arginine-vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated Lp of rat IMCD in a dose-dependent manner, with the threshold effect at 10(-6) M. Furosemide (10(-4) M) reduced Lp from 20.5 +/- 2.3 to 12.1 +/- 1.2 (P less than 0.01) reversibility, but had no effect when added to the perfusate. In addition, furosemide reduced dibutyryl cyclic AMP-stimulated Lp from 20.3 +/- 1.1 to 11.2 +/- 1.6 (P less than 0.01). This effect of furosemide was also observed with indomethacin, a PGE2 synthesis inhibitor. The addition of indomethacin (10(-4) M) to AVP (50 microU/ml) increased Lp from 24.7 +/- 2.3 to 29.7 +/- 2.8 (P less than 0.001), which was reduced to 20.3 +/- 2.6 (P less than 0.001) when furosemide was added to indomethacin in the bath.

The resulting intracellular signals, including changes of cytosolic Ca2+, pH, and cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cAMP) are known to also regulate the growth of many cell types. Since eicosanoids have been shown to interfere with cell proliferation in culture, we studied DNA synthesis and cell number in rat mesangial cell cultures exposed to a selective phospholipase C activator, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), or to the cAMP-stimulating PGI2 analogue, Iloprost. PGF2 alpha dose-dependently enhanced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in the presence of insulin, with an EC50 of 0.1 microM. This eicosanoid potentiated the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or low concentrations of serum. Maximum stimulatory potency was about one-third that of PDGF. Removal of PGF2 alpha after short-term stimulation (30 min) did not reverse its mitogenic effect. Iloprost had no effect on DNA synthesis of quiescent cells, but potently inhibited growth stimulated by various concentrations of fetal serum. PG released within the glomerular microcirculation may play a regulatory role in both normal and deranged mesangial cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "It is unclear whether glomerular hemodynamic changes always accompany alterations in dietary protein, and whether nonhemodynamic factors associated with a high protein intake can influence glomerular injury. In the present study, uninephrectomized (UNx) male rats were fed either standard (20%) or high (40%) protein diets. Body growth was comparable in the two diet groups. At 30 weeks of age, UNx rats fed high protein had increased albuminuria (36.7 +/- 12.6 mg/24 hr), compared to UNx rats fed standard protein (10.2 +/- 6.2 mg/24 hr; P less than 0.05). The incidence of focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) at 36 weeks was markedly increased in the high protein rats (19.0 +/- 7.7%), compared to the standard protein rats (3.2 +/- 2.0%; P less than 0.05). Moreover, FGS in the high protein rats correlated with the serum cholesterol level measured at 18, 24, and 30 weeks of age. Glomerular hemodynamics were assessed before glomerular injury developed in separate groups of UNx rats fed either standard or high protein. Single nephron GFR (SNGFR) and single nephron plasma flow (SNPF) were increased in UNx rats, compared to two-kidney rats fed standard protein. SNGFR and SNPF, however, were not different between UNx rats fed standard or high protein. Glomerular capillary pressure (PGC) was not different between UNx rats fed standard protein (51.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) and two-kidney controls (53.1 +/- 1.5 mm Hg). Moreover, PGC was not altered in UNx rats fed high protein (51.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg). We conclude that high dietary protein can accelerate the development of glomerular injury independent of effects on glomerular hemodynamics.\r"

Actively growing mesangial cells produced procoagulant activity (PCA) that was present in intact cells (surface-associated), was inhibitable by cyclohexamide and which, by clotting assay, had the characteristics of tissue factor. This PCA decreased with incubation of cells in serum-deprived medium. Incubation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) induced increased detectable tissue factor by mesangial cells within two hours which was maximal by four hours. We conclude that quiescent mesangial cells produce a small amount of tissue factor-like procoagulant activity, and that this PCA can be stimulated by incubation with TNF alpha, LPS or when cells are actively growing in high serum medium. Therefore mesangial cells have the capability of contributing to fibrin formation during inflammatory glomerular injury or sepsis.\r"

Increasing the activity of the peritoneal macrophages, the predominant cell type found in the peritoneal cavity, may be a promising treatment for this infection. The effect of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] on the activity of peritoneal macrophages from CAPD patients and nonuremic controls was studied. 1,25(OH)2D3 had a biphasic effect on superoxide generation in the concentration range of 2.5 10(-9) M to 5 x 10(-6) M with a peak at 2 x 10(-8) M. The addition of 2 x 10(-8) M 1,25(OH)2D3 to nonuremic control macrophages for 24 hours caused a significant twofold increase in superoxide generation in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), from 2.21 + 0.2 to 4.1 + 0.2 nmol/10(6) mac (P less than 0.001), and enhanced the bactericidal activity from 60 + 7% to 85 + 9% (P less than 0.005). CAPD patients were divided into two groups: Group A, patients with high peritonitis incidence (HPI); group B, patients with low peritonitis incidence (LPI). Macrophages from HPI patients show a lower bactericidal activity (37 +/- 5%) and were not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3 after 24 hours of treatment. The increase in macrophage activity was seen only after three days of incubation with the hormone. Macrophages from this group generated a high amount of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) during the first 24 hours in culture (7.8 +/- 0.52 ng/ml as compared with 0.35 +/- 0.03 ng/ml in the controls).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In particular, attention has been focused on a nephropathy characterized clinically by nephrotic proteinuria and rapidly advancing renal insufficiency, and histologically by focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). To evaluate the relationship between HIV infection and structural renal disease, we reviewed all consultations between January 1982 and March 1988 to the Division of Nephrology at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), a municipal hospital treating approximately one-third of AIDS cases in San Francisco. Seventy-three consultation requests were received during this period regarding patients with AIDS (48), AIDS-Related Complex (23), or asymptomatic HIV infection (2). Of these, 27 gave evidence of structural renal disease (Group I): 14 had chronic renal insufficiency, in 10 of whom nephrotic proteinuria was also present. However, progression of renal insufficiency to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in this group did not follow the rapid course described for HIV-associated nephropathy. Renal tissue was examined in 11 Group I patients and showed FSGS in four and a variety of acute and chronic glomerular and tubulointerstitial changes in the others. In 46 Group II patients, consultation was requested for acute renal failure or fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base disturbances. We also reviewed 91 consecutive autopsies performed in patients dying with AIDS at SFGH between 1981 and 1986.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients ranged in age from 2 to 24 years, with an average of 11.2 years. The duration of dialysis ranged from 0.5 to 63 months, with an average of 12.6 months. The kidneys, which were conventionally prepared for histological observation, were subjectively divided into three groups depending on the degree of remaining nephrons. Patients with completely atrophic type (type 1), incompletely atrophic type (type 2), and mixed type of atrophy and hypertrophy (type 3) had a duration of dialysis of 20.0, 12.3, 6.3 months, respectively (Type 1 greater than Type 3, P less than 0.01). A correlation between histology and function was demonstrated, since urinary output was more than 200 ml/day in most of the type 3 patients, and less than 20 ml/day in all of the patients with type 1. The findings suggest that the functioning nephrons that remained at the beginning of dialysis generally become atrophic within one year after the initiation of dialysis. The ratio of kidney weight to body weight showed a significant negative correlation with both the duration of dialysis and that of illness. The histopathological changes seen in kidneys of patients on dialysis were reviewed. The findings suggested that certain changes, unusual epithelial proliferations an oxalate deposition, are associated with persisting renal function rather than the duration of dialysis.\r"

In six men who ingested a constant whole-foods diet containing (per 70 kg body wt) 27 mmol/day Pi and 52 mEq/day K+, we increased diet K+ to 156 mmol/day with supplements first of potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) alone and then of potassium chloride (KCL) alone, each for eight days interrupted by an eight-day recovery period of no K+ supplement. Urine Pi decreased promptly with either K(+)-salt, each inducing a persisting retention of 7 to 10 mmoles Pi, which was dumped during recovery. Fasting serum [Pi] increased with either K+ supplement (P = 0.022, repeated measures analysis of variance); the composite mean serum [Pi] for the two K(+)-supplement periods exceeded that for the two periods without supplements (P less than 0.01, paired t-test). Conversely, the concentrations of serum calcitriol decreased with either K+ supplement (P = 0.020). Among subjects, the diet K(+)-induced increases in serum [Pi] correlated with those in plasma [K+] (r = 0.64, P = 0.027); the decreases in serum calcitriol concentration correlated with the increases in serum [Pi] (r = -0.69, P = 0.014). There were no significant differences among periods in serum parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, urine cyclic AMP excretion, plasma renin activity, body weight, serum albumin, or creatinine clearance; plasma volume decreased slightly during KCL but not during KHCO3 periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The calculated rate of NE release into plasma was low in uremics even though their plasma NE was normal. Dopamine beta hydroxylase (D beta H) and chromogranin A are released from sympathetic nerve endings along with NE. D beta H levels were low in uremia and D beta H levels doubled following hemodialysis. Chromogranin A levels were very high in uremics and increased slightly following hemodialysis. Plasma clearance of both NE and chromogranin A appears low in renal failure. The calculated rate of NE release is diminished in uremics, which is in accord with reports of autonomic neuropathy in these patients.\r"

During both the control and study periods, patients were clinically evaluated and had serum biochemistry and 24-hour clearance of creatinine, urea and protein excretion checked monthly. The 51Cr-EDTA clearance (plasma slope and urinary clearance) was determined every third month. The progression of renal failure was evaluated from the regressions of the reciprocal of serum creatinine (SCr-1), creatinine clearance and urinary 51Cr-EDTA clearance against time. Having defined criteria for progression, only patients in whom renal failure had progressed over 12 or 24 months were randomized. In 28 patients, data were available, permitting a comparison of the progression of renal failure (estimated from regression of SCr-1 and of creatinine clearance against time) during the retrospective and prospective periods. There was a significant correlation between the change in progression rate and the change in mean arterial pressure, a relationship which was also present in patients with mild hypertension or those with blood pressure within the \"normal\" range. The urinary protein excretion also correlated with the change in mean arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To elucidate the effect of moderate protein limitation in type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetics with normoalbuminuria, eight such patients were selected for the study (age 38 +/- 7 years SD, diabetes duration 21 +/- 9 years). The patients were randomized to follow, alternately, four weeks of their usual protein intake (19% of energy) and four weeks of a limited protein intake (12% of energy). Kidney function was investigated after the two dietary periods. GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured using a constant infusion technique (125I-iothalamate/131I-hippuran), and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) by radioimmunoassay. It was found that the limited protein diet reduced GFR from 146 +/- 23 to 132 +/- 24 ml/min/1.73 m2 (2P less than 0.005). A tendency towards a fall in RPF was seen (549 +/- 128 vs. 503 +/- 125 ml/min; 2P = 0.06), while total renal resistance rose from 0.17 +/- 0.03 to 0.20 +/- 0.05 mm Hg/ml/min (2P = 0.05). No significant changes in filtration fraction, UAE and blood pressure were seen. HbA1c, fructosamine, insulin dose and body weight were unchanged during the two diets; also serum protein, albumin, phosphate and calcium remained unaltered. Serum urea was significantly reduced on the limited protein intake. Patients were generally pleased with the limited protein diet. Thus, limitation of the often high protein intake in diabetics might be valuable and realistic. The long-term renal protective effect remains to be investigated.\r"

Aluminum-containing drugs are widely used to control serum phosphate, but this therapy carries the well-known risk of aluminum toxicity. Previously we demonstrated that a mixture of ketoacids is very effective in lowering increased serum phosphate and serum PTH levels. Recent studies to clarify the underlying mechanisms whereby these compounds lower serum phosphate revealed that ketoacids act as intestinal phosphate binders. In balance studies we demonstrated that intestinal phosphorus uptake decreased in normal subjects (decrease of absorption during ingestion: 0.7-3.14 mmol/day). Additional in vitro studies not only confirmed the in vivo results but also showed that ketoacids are as efficient as calcium carbonate although they provide less calcium. It is of further interest that ketoacids reached their greatest binding efficiency when the pH is 7.0, whereas calcium carbonate binds phosphate predominantly when the pH is 2.0 or 5.0. Ketoacids represent a further therapy to lower serum phosphate in uremia. As they provide less calcium than calcium carbonate, they could be considered as an advantageous, less dangerous alternative.\r"

In this study, we have examined the effects of dietary protein manipulations on IGF-I and -II within remaining kidneys of rats during CRG following UNx. Adult Wistar rats were given a LPD (8% wt/wt casein), medium protein diet (MPD, 18%), or high protein diet (HPD, 78%) for 30 days prior to surgery. At surgery, either a right UNx or a sham operation was performed. Four days later, animals were sacrificed. Kidney weight, protein, DNA, IGF-I and -II contents were measured. Serum and hepatic content of IGF-I were also measured. CRG (%) was calculated comparing kidney weights pre- and post-UNx and between UNx and sham operated rats at sacrifice. At sacrifice, kidney weight was proportional to dietary protein intake in sham and UNx rats. Fractional kidney wt was significantly increased in UNx rats on each of the three diets compared to sham operated animals (P less than 0.001), but was greater in rats on HPD (35%) compared to those on MPD (23%) or LPD (20%). CRG was minimal on LPD (9.6 +/- 6.8%), compared to MPD (23.8 +/- 9.6%) and HPD (43.8 +/- 25.4%).

  ".W": "The effect of diets containing 8.5%, 21% or 40% protein on growth, urinary albumin excretion and serum albumin concentration was determined in rats with Heymann nephritis and in non-nephrotic control animals. Urinary albumin excretion was greater in nephrotic rats with each increment in dietary protein intake, and serum albumin concentration tended to be least in nephrotic rats fed 40% protein. Albuminuria decreased spontaneously and serum albumin concentration increased in nephrotic rats fed 8.5% protein for 25 days. Enalapril treatment caused a further reduction in urinary albumin excretion and an increase in serum albumin concentration in nephrotic rats fed 8.5% protein. Albuminuria did not decrease nor did serum albumin concentration increase in nephrotic rats fed 40% protein without enalapril treatment, but enalapril caused a significant reduction in urinary albumin excretion and an increase in serum albumin concentration in nephrotic rats fed either 8.5% or 40% protein. The rate of growth in normal rats was greatest when they were fed 21% protein, compared to either 8.5% or 40% protein. Growth rate was significantly reduced in nephrotic rats, regardless of dietary protein intake and regardless of treatment with enalapril, but the 21% protein diet still induced the most rapid rate of growth. Growth rate was not significantly different in nephrotic rats fed either 40% or 8.5% protein. The difference in weight between pair fed nephrotic and control animals fed 21% protein was due to a decrease in carcass and skin weight in nephrotic animals. Carcass protein was significantly reduced in the nephrotic animals, and carcass saponafiable fat tended to be reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Increased albumin synthetic rate might be due to the presence of increased amino acids available for protein synthesis causing more efficient translation of preformed albumin mRNA, or instead might be linked to increased steady state albumin mRNA levels in the liver. Albumin synthesis, hepatic albumin mRNA content, and albumin mRNA relative to beta actin mRNA (as an internal control) (Alb/beta Act), were measured in rats with Heymann nephritis fed either 8.5% protein (LP), or after protein intake was increased to 40% for 4 days (HP). enalapril (E) was used to modulate the proteinuric effect of HP, yielding four experimental groups, LPN (8.5% protein nephrotic, no enalapril), LPE (8.5% protein, enalapril treated), HPN (40% protein nephrotic, no enalapril), and HPE (40% protein, enalapril treated). Dietary protein augmentation increased the rate of albumin synthesis, steady-state albumin mRNA levels, and Alb/beta Act in both HPN and HPE, compared to either LPH or LPE, even though serum albumin concentration was greater in HPE than in either of the groups fed LP. Both albumin mRNA and Alb/beta Act correlated with the rate of albumin synthesis (r = 0.531, P less than 0.05; and 0.553, P less than 0.01 respectively). Nuclear run-on assays were performed using nuclei isolated from the livers of LPN or HPN to determine whether increased albumin mRNA resulted from an increase in the rate of albumin mRNA transcription.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the nutritional status of 95 patients with chronic renal insufficiency who participated in the feasibility phase of the NIH funded Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study. All patients were seen monthly by a physician and dietitian. After a baseline period, the patients were randomly assigned either to a mildly protein-restricted control diet or to one of three low protein, low phosphorus diets. Patients with clear evidence for protein-calorie malnutrition were excluded from the study. Patients were followed for an average of 12.4 months (range, 0 to 22 months). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the commencement of the experimental diets ranged from 8 to 56 ml/min/1.73 m2. Assessment of the nutritional parameters indicated that none of the four diet treatment groups developed protein-calorie malnutrition. At the end of treatment with the experimental diets, most nutritional parameters were normal and few had worsened. Nonetheless, the following observations indicated that some patients had developed subtle evidence for protein-calorie malnutrition. There were positive correlations between the GFR and the serum transferrin and creatinine:height ratio. In men, arm muscle area and, at the onset of the experimental diets, the % standard body weight also correlated with the GFR. In women, GFR correlated with dietary energy intake. When patients were grouped according to their GFR level, those with the lowest GFR also tended to have lower energy intakes, serum transferrin levels and creatinine:height ratios. Patients with a GFR of 24 ml/min/1.73 m2 or lower tended to lose body mass during the study. In all groups of patients, the estimated actual energy intake was significantly lower than the prescribed intake. On the other hand, in the patients assigned to one of the three low protein, low phosphorus diets, nitrogen intake was above the prescribed level. The low energy intake of those patients with the lower GFR levels may contribute to their propensity to become malnourished.\r"

  ".U": "90265044\r", 
  ".W": "There have now been many studies on the effects of growth hormone (GH) on renal function. Chronically elevated GH levels, such as occur in acromegaly, are associated with an increase in renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and kidney size. When GH falls in these individuals (such as, after hypophysectomy in acromegalic patients), RPF, GFR and renal size decrease. A rapid increase in plasma GH in normal or growth hormone deficient adults, such as occurs after GH injection, causes an increase in RPF and GFR. However, these effects on renal function are delayed, occurring between 5.5 and 23 hours after the GH injection and in association with an elevation in the plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). These observations suggest that IGF-I may mediate the GH stimulated increase in RPF and GFR. We evaluated this question in rats starved for three days. A 20 minute infusion of IGF-I causes an increase in RPF and GFR in these animals. This effect could be blocked by indomethacin but not by somatostatin. These findings suggest that: 1) GH injection does increase RPF and GFR; 2) this effect on GH, which is delayed for several hours seems to be mediated by IGF-I; and 3) a 20-minute IGF-I infusion itself increases RPF and GFR in starved rats. The effect of IGF-I on renal function seems to require the presence of eicosanoids. Further studies will be necessary to examine whether IGF-I is a physiological regulator of renal function.\r"

The six-month data from these children indicated that exogenous rhGH significantly improved the growth rate in all children (mean height velocity SDS before therapy, -2.8; during the treatment period, +2.5). This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in serum somatomedin bioactivity. Low normal basal serum IGF I concentrations were increased by rhGH. Elevated basal serum IGF II concentrations were further increased by rhGH treatment. The pharmacokinetic profile of rhGH in uremia resembles that of the non-uremic state; no accumulation was seen after 14 days of treatment. Glucose tolerance did not change, and insulin levels remained stable throughout the six-month observation period. No rhGH antibodies were detected. Although these short-term results are very encouraging, the effects of rhGH on the prognosis for final height need to be assessed over a longer period of time.\r"

Using animal models of experimental uremia, it was found that excess lactate formation in muscle is directly related to the rate of protein breakdown. This suggests that abnormal energy metabolism may be one mechanism for protein wasting. A second mechanism involves metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis activates the catabolism of protein and amino acids in muscle of uremic rats independently of azotemia. Defects in sodium transport by Na,K-ATPase and the Na/K/Cl cotransport system suggest that intracellular ions including hydrogen may be abnormal. If this were the case, uremia would increase the susceptibility to the catabolic effect of metabolic acidosis.\r"

To study whether this metabolic pattern is mediated by glucocorticoids, we investigated the effect of the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 on both muscle protein breakdown and urea and glucose production of isolated hepatocytes in acutely uremic rats. Animals were rendered uremic by bilateral nephrectomy (BNX). Forty-eight hours after BNX, the rats had markedly elevated serum levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, potassium, and phosphorus. In uremic rats receiving RU 38486 comparable levels of serum creatinine were found, but the serum levels of urea nitrogen (221 +/- 4 vs. 259 +/- 5 mg/dl) and phosphorus (6.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter) were significantly decreased as compared to uremic animals without RU 38486. In comparison to sham operated rats, urea-N appearance (net urea production) was increased by 56% 48 hours after BNX. This increment was almost completely reversed in uremic animals receiving the antiglucocorticoid. In untreated uremic rats, plasma levels of Nt-methylhistidine were 10.3 +/- 0.9 micrograms/dl, whereas the administration of RU 38486 caused a significant decline in the levels of this amino acid (7.6 +/- 0.5 micrograms/dl). Hepatic glucose production in BNX rats was significantly increased from alanine (+174%), glutamine (+158%), and serine (+87%) as compared to sham-operated controls. Concomitantly, hepatic urea formation from amino acid substrates was also enhanced in BNX animals. With the administration of RU 38486 to acutely uremic rats, both hepatic glucose and urea production were normalized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In order to maintain good nutritional status, branched-chain ketoacids (BCKA) can be added to these diets. The effects of BCKA on protein metabolism in skeletal muscle is well established, but there is little information about their effects on liver metabolism. Protein deprivation affects some aspects of liver function such as drug metabolism (glutathione, cytochrome P-450 and enzymes). In a chronic protein malnutrition model, we have tested the efficacy of BCKA to correct these abnormalities when they are added to a low protein diet. RNA/DNA, liver proteins, microsomal proteins and glutathione were markedly improved; cytochrome P-450 was only partly improved, and aminopyrine demethylase was not affected. In conclusion, this study suggests that BCKA have a beneficial effect and may prevent the deterioration in the nutritional state of the liver in uremic patients.\r"

In the first group, a 50 g oral glucose tolerance test showed that after three months blood glucose was significantly reduced at T60 (P less than 0.05) and serum insulin at T0, T30 (P less than 0.05) and T60 (P less than 0.02). Ten patients of the first group underwent an euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp study; the tissue sensitivity to insulin index of all three clamp periods improved (P less than 0.01 for the first and second, P less than 0.02 for the third). Five patients in the second group underwent a euglycemic clamp study; glucose metabolism increased with each clamp period. Concomitantly, their daily insulin requirements decreased from 37.2 +/- 3.1 to 24.8 +/- 2.7 U/day (P less than 0.05). This conspicuous improvement observed in both groups might be related to a decrease in uremic toxin(s) derived from protein intake. Beneficial results on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular pathology may occur from the reduction of hyperinsulinism.\r"

Ratios between oleic and arachidonic acid and between eicosatrienoic and arachidonic acids were also significantly higher in the dialysis group. In a separate group of either chronic dialysis patients, L-carnitine was given intravenously for a period of 6 to 18 months. In this group linoleic, linolenic and eicosatrienoic acids were not significantly different from normal controls. The ratio between eicosatrienoic and arachidonic acids was also similar to normal controls. However, arachidonic acid remained significantly lower and oleic acid significantly elevated in the carnitine group. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acid was higher in the untreated dialysis patients compared to L-carnitine treated patients (0.75 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.06, P less than 0.01). Significant abnormalities in distribution of fatty acids was seen in hemodialyzed patients. Thus preliminary data suggest significant depletion of essential fatty acids in dialysis patients which is partially corrected by treatment of patients with L-carnitine.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term intravenous supplementation with low dose L-carnitine (5 mg/kg body wt) was investigated in seven hemodialyzed children with type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. Carnitine was given at the completion of each hemodialysis treatment (3 times a week) over a period of five months. This treatment resulted in a rise in total plasma carnitine concentrations (117.7 +/- 33.0 microM) as compared to before therapy (37.9 +/- 15.8 microM); the free fraction was the chief portion of this elevation. Prior to therapy the patients had high plasma triglyceride concentrations (3.82 +/- 1.6 mM) which were markedly reduced after five months of carnitine therapy (1.86 +/- 0.7 mM; P less than or equal to 0.05). The initially low HDL-cholesterol levels (0.91 +/- 0.2 mM) were increased (1.13 +/- 0.2 mM; P less than or equal to 0.05) after supplementation. Thus, long-term low-dose carnitine supplementation improves the disturbed lipid metabolism; this suggests an important role for carnitine in uremic children and may justify the use of supplemental carnitine.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen hyperlipidemic hemodialysis patients were treated with 1, 5, and 15 mg L-carnitine/kg body weight (each dose was given for three months) given intravenously at the end of the dialysis therapy. Low dose L-carnitine treatment caused an increase in plasma total carnitine (TC), short chain acylcarnitine (SCC), and long chain acylcarnitine (LCC). An increase in plasma free carnitine (FC) occurred only in the 10 responders who showed a significant decrease in serum triglycerides. Serum VLDL triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol and VLDL phospholipids also decreased in the responders compared to nonresponders. There was no difference in HDL- and LDL-lipoproteins in both responders and nonresponders. L-carnitine in doses of 5 or 15 mg/kg body weight caused markedly elevated plasma levels of all carnitine fractions but no further lipid lowering effect. Moreover, enhanced serum triglycerides were observed in some hemodialysis patients. Thirteen out of 15 patients displayed an increase of HDL triglycerides and 5, an increase of VLDL triglycerides. Our data suggest that low doses of L-carnitine are effective in treating hypertriglyceridemia in selected patients. Low dose L-carnitine also avoids unphysiological high plasma levels of carnitine and carnitine esters and prevents antiketogenic effects in hemodialysis patients.\r"

Subjects were fed standard hospital foods providing nutrients in amounts recommended for adult stable hemodialyzed patients. The amount of zinc in the diet was kept constant at 10 mg per day. After one week of stabilization, blood, urine, used dialysate (in patients on dialysis days) and stool samples were collected daily for the next two weeks. In comparison to controls, patients had lower plasma zinc levels (mean +/- SD, 112 +/- 10 vs. 82 +/- 12 micrograms/dl, P less than 0.01), lower urinary zinc excretion (560 +/- 120 vs. 40 +/- 20 mg/24 hrs, P less than 0.001) and higher fecal zinc losses (8.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 10.2 +/- 0.6 mg/24 hrs, P less than 0.01). Dialytic zinc losses were minimal (26 +/- 4 micrograms/treatment). During the study period, patients were in a negative zinc balance while normal controls maintained a positive zinc balance on 10 mg dietary zinc intake. These results demonstrate that augmented fecal zinc excretion in the presence of hypozincemia contributes to the negative zinc balance in hemodialyzed uremic patients.\r"

Selenium deficiency has been found in association with skeletal and cardiac myopathy and may increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases and for cancer. We studied 39 hemodialysis patients and 15 control subjects. Plasma selenium, plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity were lower than in controls (38 +/- 14 vs. 88 +/- 17 micrograms/liter (P less than 0.01); 153 +/- 32 vs. 334 +/- 41 IU/liter (P less than 0.01), 19 +/- 4 vs. 26 +/- 4 IU/g Hb (P less than 0.01), respectively). Plasma selenium and plasma glutathione peroxidase activity were strongly correlated with duration of dialysis. There was no correlation between plasma selenium and protein or calorie intakes. Plasma selenium was lower in patients dialyzed with highly permeable membranes (P less than 0.01). The total muscle mass, assessed by anthropometry, was lower in the patients who had the lowest plasma selenium (P less than 0.01) and plasma glutathione peroxidase activity (P less than 0.05). Interventricular septum hypertrophy, documented by echocardiography, was greater in patients with the lowest plasma selenium and plasma glutathione peroxidase activity (P less than 0.01). Twenty hemodialysis patients had oral supplementation of 500 micrograms/day of sodium selenite for three months, and then, 200 micrograms/day for the next three months. Plasma selenium increased as early as the first week and reached a plateau similar to the control levels after three weeks. Plasma glutathione peroxidase activity increased after two months but remained below controls. Erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity reached a higher value than controls after one month.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A new EAA formulation (BS695), enriched with valine and threonine, containing some histidine, and low in phenylalanine and methionine was recently developed. We randomly supplemented 11 MHP with this solution (treated group, TG) and 10 MHP with a standard AA solution containing both essential and non-essential AA (control group, CG). Both groups received 3.65 g of nitrogen, i.v. three times per week during hemodialysis for six months. During treatment, dietary intake remained stable in both groups. Before treatment, after three and six months of treatment, and six months after the end of treatment, we determined routine blood chemistries, anthropometry, serum protein levels (albumin, transferrin), delayed cutaneous sensitivity (Multi-test), protein catabolic rate (PCR), plasma AA content and motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV). Before treatment PEU, predominantly of marasmic type, was common. After treatment anthropometry and immune response were unchanged in both groups; PCR increased more in CG than in TG; serum albumin levels decreased significantly only in CG; MNCV improved in TG and worsened in CG. These preliminary results suggest that this new EAA formulation may have beneficial effects on some nutrition related abnormalities of MHP. Better results might occur with long-term AA supplementation, particularly if it is associated with a higher energy intake.\r"

In addition, urinary excretion of proteins from kidney tissue and serum from 30 patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (RCDT) were analyzed. Compared to the controls, ATA, APM and GGT activities were significantly higher in urine specimens of patients with GFR greater than 25 ml/min, whereas the urinary APM, GGT and SGP concentrations were decreased, and correlated with the GFR. Urinary GGT activity was negatively correlated with ATA activity but positively correlated with the decrease in GFR. Urine ATA activity of RCDT patients was higher compared to normal controls (2P = 0.001). Urinary excretion of serum proteins of RCDT patients, as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, disclosed heavy tubular proteinuria, indicating predominant tubular rather than glomerular alterations in handling of proteins. Histochemical evaluation of kidney sections from RCDT patients revealed clusters of hypertrophic nephrons with increased glomerular and tubular concentration of immunoreactive membrane proteins. However, there was a general decrease in renal cell-marker concentrations as observed by quantitative image analyses. These results indicate that renal injury is associated with a modulation in the synthesis of tubular and glomerular cell markers.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of an acute protein load on renal hemodynamic responses and plasma glucagon levels were investigated in 31 patients with biopsy proven chronic glomerulonephritis (24 cases) or chronic renal failure (6 cases). After baseline clearance measurements, the subjects ingested a high protein meal consisting of 1.2 to 1.5 g protein/kg body weight in the form of cooked beef followed by a second set of measurements. This acute protein load resulted in a rise of both creatinine and PAH clearances (from 86.5 +/- 6.0 ml/min to 98.3 +/- 7.1 ml/min and 531.1 +/- 59.1 ml/min to 688.9 +/- 72.9 ml/min, respectively). This was associated with an elevation of plasma glucagon levels from 104.6 +/- 7.9 pg/ml to 134.5 +/- 7.5 pg/ml. From these data we suggest that the augmentation of renal function following a high protein intake may be mediated by the simultaneous rise of plasma glucagon levels, and that the glucagon concentration in the portal vein rather than in the peripheral blood has a pivotal role in this setting.\r"

During the feasibility phase, 96 patients aged 18 to 75 years, with previously declining reciprocal serum creatinine concentration (1/PCr) and current glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 7.5 to 80 ml/min/1.73 m2, were randomly assigned four study diets. After randomization, 91 patients were followed for a mean duration of 14.1 months. GFR, 1/PCr and creatinine clearance (CCr) were measured every three months. In an earlier report, we demonstrated relatively weak correlations of rates of change in GFR and 1/PCr during the feasibility phase; the proportion of variability in 1/PCr slopes that was explained by variability in GFR slopes (r2) was only 0.49 to 0.55. In this study, we examined the relationship of GFR and 1/PCr to other determinants of the serum creatinine concentration, including filtration (GFCr), secretion (TSCr), and total renal excretion (UCrV) of creatinine. Our results show that these parameters varied widely among individuals and changed over time. These findings may explain, in part, the relatively weak correlations. These results strengthen our previous suggestion that the rate of change in 1/PCr may not be an accurate index of the rate of change in GFR and raise questions about the validity of conclusions from other studies in which the efficacy of dietary modification in retarding the progression of renal disease was based principally on measurements of 1/PCr.\r"

They were then randomized to a synthetic diet containing either 8% or 25% protein. Hemodynamic and metabolic measurements were obtained in awake animals every four months. Baseline mean blood pressure, inulin clearance, protein and urea nitrogen excretion in intact animals on 15% protein averaged 75.5 +/- 3.5 (SE) mm Hg, 42.9 +/- 2.7 ml/min, 52 +/- 4.3 mg/24 hr, and 3.8 +/- 0.4 g/24 hr, respectively. At 12 months, values in the same baboons with a remnant kidney on 8% versus 25% protein averaged 100.6 versus 96.7 mm Hg, 29.2 versus 54.9 ml/min (P less than 0.01), 111 versus 108 mg/24 hr, and 3.4 versus 11.0 g/24 hr (P less than 0.001), respectively. Electron microscopic examination of renal biopsies obtained eight months after nephrectomy was normal but for slightly increased mesangial matrix in three animals. Thus, blood pressure increased (P less than 0.01), proteinuria doubled (P less than 0.01) and adaptations in GFR developed within four months of renal mass reduction, without significant changes occurring between four and 12 months. The adaptations in GFR were markedly attenuated by low protein intake. Further follow-up is necessary to assess progression of renal disease and the impact of different protein diets.\r"

The long-term results of this therapeutic modality may be different than the short-term effects. In our nephrology outpatient department, a prospective randomized trial has been in progress since April, 1982. In 1984, we reported a general beneficial effect of our diet after two years of follow-up. Two hundred and forty-eight patients with initial creatinine clearances between 10 and 60 ml/min entered the trial. Patients were stratified for sex, age and degree of renal insufficiency. One hundred and twenty-nine patients were randomly assigned to a DPR-group (0.4 to 0.6 g/kg/day); 118 patients to a control group. Patients on DPR visited the dietitian every three months during the first 24 months of the study; thereafter, as with the controls, the dietitian visits were only for specific needs. Urea excretion decreased significantly in DPR patients as a sign of good compliance and stayed at that level, even without frequent visits to the dietitian. Biochemical parameters showed no signs of malnutrition. Amino acid profiles were related to the degree of renal failure. The diet appeared to have a selective effect on the progression rate of renal failure: only patients with primary glomerular disease responded to the diet. Furthermore, there were striking intersex differences. Males showed a more rapid decline towards end-stage renal failure, but responded in a positive way to the diet, whereas female patients did not benefit from the dietary manipulation at all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All received prophylactic corticosteroid replacement. Blood samples were obtained immediately after operation, at the onset of diabetes insipidus, and 24 h later. Immediately after trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery, plasma vasopressin (AVP) was raised but had fallen to subnormal concentrations by the onset of diabetes insipidus. After transfrontal hypothalamic surgery diabetes insipidus occurred sooner and was associated with high plasma AVP immunoreactivity--but the plasma showed no antidiuretic bioactivity and greatly attenuated the antidiuretic response to standard AVP. Early diabetes insipidus after hypothalamic surgery is associated with release of a substance, presumably an analogue, from the damaged hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system, which acts as an antagonist to normal AVP activity; after trans-sphenoidal operations diabetes insipidus seems to be caused by failure of AVP release.\r"

The plantation microfilarial load in a sample of adults was reduced by 86% 6 months after initial treatment and by 78% after 1 year. Compliance was 97% with each round of treatment.

The hemangioma was initially treated twice with YAG laser photocoagulation plus direct injection of steroids. This treatment promptly stopped the rapid growth and induced blanching as well as a 25% shrinkage with each treatment. Arteriogram with superselective embolization produced a further shrinkage of the hemangioma. Finally, the contact YAG laser with sapphire scalpel tips was utilized for complete and cosmetically satisfactory hemangioma resection. The treatment of a massive cavernous hemangioma by a combination of modalities is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Gaseous and particulate emissions from laser surgery are often controlled by the use of smoke evacuators. Thus it is important that factors affecting the performance of these evacuators be understood. In this study, a tracer gas technique was used to examine a number of factors affecting the performance of smoke evacuators, including evacuator flow rate, distance from the evacuator nozzle to the surgical site, and direction and speed of external air flow in relation to nozzle flow. The tracer gas technique allowed the release of emissions to be visualized with infrared imaging and also allowed the collection efficiency to be assessed quantitatively. The results were demonstrated with the use of a surgical laser system. It was found that the collection efficiency of the smoke evacuator was affected by all the factors studied. Increasing the evacuator flow rate allowed the collection of emissions under conditions in which lower evacuator flow rates had less efficient collection. The speed and direction of external air flow affected collection of emissions greatly. If the air flow was in the same direction as the nozzle flow, efficient collection of emissions at a distance from the emission release point was observed. However, at other angles relative to nozzle flow, the efficiency degraded rapidly with distance from the emission release site. With the use of the surgical laser system, at laser powers of 30 W, the tracer system predicted the collection of emissions. At 60 and 100 W of laser power, higher external air flows and greater attention to nozzle positioning were necessary. Based on the results of this study, conclusions are drawn on how to improve the collection efficiency of smoke evacuators used in laser surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Contact probes made from synthetic sapphire crystal, designed for general laser surgery, are currently being evaluated for use in laser angioplasty. Their mode of action and safety in the context of arterial recanalisation is unknown, particularly with respect to the degree of probe and catheter heating. Infrared thermal imaging was used to investigate the surface temperature rise of various rounded sapphire probes during emission of continuous wave Nd-YAG (1,064 nm) laser energy. Catheter safety was addressed by analyzing the temperature of the metal interface between the optical fiber and sapphire, as well as the catheter proximal to this junction. Transmission of Nd-YAG energy through each probe was also measured. Five rounded probes of 1.8-3.0 mm diameter (three supplied by Surgical Laser Technologies [SLT], two by Living Technology [LT]), along with their respective optical catheters, were compared. There was a large temperature gradient between the front and rim of the probes. The maximum surface temperature rise of the sapphire (at 20 W, 5-second exposure) was 314-339 degrees C (SLT) and 90-108 degrees C (LT) [P less than 0.001, 3-way ANOVA]. The reason for this difference may be related to \"crazing\" of the front surface of the SLT sapphires. At all energy levels sapphire temperatures were considerably lower than attained by metal laser thermal angioplasty probes. Forward transmission was slightly higher in the SLT probes (75-85%) than the LT sapphires (54-69%). With fiber perfusion at 2 ml/minute, a minor degree of heating of the metal sapphire holders was recorded (maximum rise 35 degrees C), but heating of the catheter proximal to this was negligible. Therefore, it would appear that the risk of tip detachment or arterial injury due to heating of the connecting metal interface is extremely low. Without perfusion, however, there was a greater degree of interface heating in the LT delivery system suggestive of more laser backscattering by these sapphires compared with the SLT probes [P less than 0.001, one-way ANOVA]. The SLT system is, therefore, potentially safer in this respect. These results suggest that some degree of surface heating of contact probes due to energy absorption within the sapphire does occur, but is localised to the front of the probe. This effect may contribute to the process of arterial recanalisation with this device. However, variation in the thermal and optical properties of sapphires from different sources has been demonstrated. The influence of these properties on plaque ablation, and ultimately the clinical performance of different contact probe systems, requires further investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Ultraviolet excited laser induced fluorescence (LIF) was studied in normal and atherosclerotic human arterial wall in vitro. Using excitation wavelengths from 306 to 310 nm, two distinct emission bands were observed in the LIF of both normal and pathologic aorta: a short wavelength band, peaking at 340 nm emission, which was attributed to tryptophan; and a long wavelength band, peaking at 380 nm emission, which was assigned to a combination of collagen and elastin. The intensity of the short wavelength band was quite sensitive to the choice of excitation wavelength, while the long wavelength band was not, so that the relative contributions of the bands could be controlled by the precise choice of excitation wavelength. A valley in the spectra at 418 nm was attributed to fluorescence reabsorption by oxy-hemoglobin. By using 308 nm excitation to observe emission simultaneously from both the short and long wavelength bands, normal and atherosclerotic aorta were spectrally distinct. Two LIF emission intensity ratios were defined to characterize both the relative tryptophan fluorescence content as well as the ratio of elastin to collagen fluorescence in each spectrum. The differences in these two emission ratios among the various histologic tissue types correlated qualitatively with the histologic and biochemical compositions of these tissues. By combining these parameters in a binary classification scheme, normal and atherosclerotic aorta were correctly distinguished in 56 of 60 total cases. Furthermore, atherosclerotic plaques, atheromatous plaques, and exposed calcifications could be classified individually with sensitivities/predictive values of 90%/90%, 100%/75%, and 82%/82%, respectively.\r"

We show that it is necessary to introduce as a heat reservoir a layer of tissue that has been liquified during the cutting process. The width of the thermally damaged region depends mainly on the extension of the liquid material that remains in the cut after the laser-tissue interaction.\r"

In the control groups, surgical resection alone resulted in 86% +/- 12% tumor recurrence. Surgical resection and intraoperative lasing without photosensitizer resulted in 75% +/- 27% tumor recurrence with the argon-dye laser and 55% +/- 18% recurrence with the multiline argon laser. In the treatment groups, surgical resection and intraoperative PDT at 630 nm resulted in 56% +/- 19% tumor recurrence whereas surgical resection and intraoperative PDT at 488-514 nm resulted in 21% +/- 7% tumor recurrence. The cause for the decrease in local recurrence in the control group using the multiline argon laser is unknown, but could it be due in part to hyperthermic effects. Intraoperative PDT was an effective adjunct to surgical resection in preventing local recurrence in this tumor model.\r"

Cell selectivity was observed in dermis and epidermis. Fibroblasts showed alteration of nuclear chromatin and cytoplasmic organelles, while some of the migratory cells adjacent to fibroblasts did not. Similar difference of damage was observed between keratinocytes and Langerhans cells in epidermis. Considering the relationship between cells and their microenvironment in tissue, this selectivity may be due to the difference of acoustical coupling of propagation of acoustic waves rather than to differential sensitivity of the cells to damage.\r"

Sixty biliary calculi--pigment (n = 40), and cholesterol (n = 20)--were fragmented in vitro. The total energy delivered per unit mass of the stone is kept constant. Two energy fluences (80 and 110 mJ/mm2) at two repetition rates (5 and 20 Hz) delivered through fibers of two core sizes (300 and 600 microns) are utilized to study the effect of different laser parameters on the fragmentation process. Although both pigment and cholesterol stones are susceptible to excimer laser fragmentation, higher fragmentation efficiency is obtained for the pigment stones than for the cholesterol stones. Our study suggests that higher energy fluence and larger fiber core size result in higher fragmentation efficiency for pigment stones. Fragmentation thresholds at stone surface for a variety of biliary calculi of known composition were measured. The threshold energy fluence is approximately 3 mJ/mm2 and 17 mJ/mm2 for pigment and cholesterol stones, respectively. Our study indicates that the 308 nm excimer laser may be effective as a laser lithotriptor with low threshold and good efficiency for biliary stone fragmentation.\r"

  ".U": "90265192\r", 
  ".W": "To differentiate the contributing factors (blood or encapsulated dye) leading to the release of encapsulated dyes from liposomes after laser exposure, we initiated an in vitro experimental study. The release of encapsulated calcein was quantified under various experimental conditions in whole blood and in buffered solution containing high-density lipoprotein. Generally, the amount of dye release improved with an increase in laser power, with a maximum release of approximately 80% of encapsulated dye. Because the laser exposure was not continuous, only 80% of each sample was actually exposed. Therefore, 80% release may be thought of as total release. In a lipoprotein/buffer mixture, the 488 nm wavelength caused greater dye release than the 577 nm wavelength, because the maximum absorption of calcein is near 488 nm. The laser wavelength at 577 nm, however, caused greater release in the blood mixture, reflecting the peak absorption of hemoglobin at near 577 nm. At a 3 x higher liposome concentration, the differences in the effects of wavelengths on the release of dye from liposomes were insignificant. Although the 577 nm wavelength is an optimum wavelength for dye and drug delivery in the presence of blood, the 488 nm wavelength might also be suitable for the release of dye from the liposomes.\r"

Thirty-three patients presented with severe hyperglycemia (mean glucose 682 mg/dl) and were hospitalized for initial treatment. Following intensive outpatient therapy including insulin or sulfonylurea for 0.25 to 96 weeks, they became normoglycemic without pharmacologic treatment. This state was characterized by normal glycosylated hemoglobin levels in 29 of 30 patients and fasting plasma glucose levels of less than or equal to 115 mg/dl in 25 of 33 patients. During clinical remission these individuals were characterized as being lean to moderately obese (body mass index less than 30.5 kg/m), relatively young (45 years of age), and largely male (male:female ratio was 2:1). Thirty percent of the patients underwent normoglycemic remission after 3 months of treatment, 64% within 6 months, and 85% within 12 months. Normoglycemic remission was not related to weight loss or amelioration of stress and lasted from several months to as long 97 months. The results of the oral glucose tolerance test during remission showed that 9 had normal, 7 had impaired, and 17 had diabetic glucose tolerance. Thirteen of the 33 patients relapsed and developed hyperglycemia after a mean of 24.9 months. Relapse was not associated with weight gain or acute stress. Islet cell antibodies were uniformly absent, implying that these individuals did not have an autoimmune form of diabetes. It is not known if remission in non-insulin-dependent diabetes is unique to the black population. Neither the prevalence nor the mechanism of the development of remission is known at this time.\r"

Such responses have stable onset latencies but their amplitudes vary depending on the position of the coil over the neck or lower back. Supramaximal responses could not be obtained. Comparison of onset latencies with estimates of peripheral conduction time using a conventional F-wave technique suggest that the site of excitation of the motor axons is about 1.3 msec conduction time distal to the cervical motoneurons and 3 msec distal to the lumbosacral motoneurons. Response configuration after paravertebral magnetic stimulation was similar to that of the standard electrically evoked M-wave in the small hand muscles but not in lower limb muscles. Responses in lower limb muscles after paravertebral magnetic stimulation may consist of additional F-wave and H-reflex components. The possible clinical role of paravertebral magnetic stimulation in the investigation of peripheral and central motor pathways is discussed in the light of these findings.\r"

Plasma Ig blocked 125I-alpha-BuTx binding by greater than 85% to the AChR extracted from denervated muscle, but only by 55% to AChR extracted from normal human muscle. Incubation of intact human muscle fibers with the plasma Ig reduced 125I-alpha-BuTx binding to the endplate AChRs by 63%, and substantially decreased the amplitude of miniature endplate potentials. We conclude that anti-alpha-BuTx site antibodies, when present, can be important in the pathophysiology of the disease.\r"

Electrical stimulation resulted in depolarization at a more proximal site. Electrical stimulation was associated with more discomfort, especially at C5-6. We conclude that electrical stimulation using a monopolar needle as the cathode is the superior technique for the clinical electrophysiologic study of the proximal brachial plexus and cervical spinal nerves.\r"

The number of satellite cells decreased, and eventually all fibers vanished. Reinnervation, if any, was poor. Partial denervation did not induce collateral reinnervation. Some denervated gastrocnemius muscles were reinnervated and after 8-12 months contained hypertrophic fibers and signs of necrosis and regeneration. When soleus muscles were completely denervated and cross-reinnervated after 4 weeks by the peroneal nerve, only half as many fibers became reinnervated after neonatal denervation as compared to muscles denervated at the age of 4 weeks. The experiments suggest that immature muscle fibers are less apt to become reinnervated than mature fibers. The few reinnervated fibers may be overloaded and therefore hypertrophy and eventually necrotize. Regeneration is abortive because satellite cells are scarce. These results may be relevant for the understanding of neuromuscular disorders with early (fetal) onset.\r"

Initially, the plantar nerves in the foot demonstrated profound axonal loss while the sural and peroneal nerves were essentially normal. The latter two nerves subsequently underwent axonal loss. Two years were required for the sural and peroneal nerves to display recovery. At 24 months, the plantar nerves continue to remain absent. A primarily distal axonopathy, significantly worse in the lower than upper extremities and requiring more than 2 years for recovery, now documents what was previously speculated: the electrophysiologic course of thallium intoxication. Additionally, this case emphasizes the need to examine the plantar nerves of the foot to avoid missing distal axonopathies during the early course of the disease process. The clinical course and pathophysiology of thallium poisoning are also reviewed.\r"

During mechanical fatigue, phosphocreatine (PCr) and pH first declined but although stimulation continued high values were recovered without mechanical recovery. Total recovery was only observed after cessation of stimulation. Partial mechanical recovery was elicited by lowering stimulation rhythm; it was accompanied by decrease in PCr to a steady-state level without pH alteration. When exhaustive exercise was induced immediately after nonexhaustive exercise, failure of mechanical function occurred without decrease in pH. Major findings were: first, during exhaustive stimulations, the greater the muscle fatigue, and the higher the PCr level at the end of stimulation. Secondly, PCr and force levels did not depend on preceding levels of PCr and pH. Thirdly, acidosis was observed transiently during the first minutes of the first exercise period. These findings strongly suggested that electrical events and/or excitation-contraction (EC) coupling play a crucial role in this type of fatigue.\r"

In patients but not in controls, recordings from the finger frequently showed loss of the second action potential of the pair, although a second action potential was present at the elbow. In these cases it seemed likely that impulse transmission through the carpal tunnel had failed because the damaged nerve at the level of the lesion had an increased refractory period of transmission (RPT) compared with its refractory period under the stimulating cathode. The possible diagnostic use of RPT measurement in CTS patients is discussed.\r"

Now we have studied the effects of this drug on the twitch force of muscle biopsies from normal and diseased human skeletal muscle. Cromakalim had little effect on the twitch force of normal muscle whereas it strongly improved the contraction force of fibers from patients suffering from hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Recordings of intracellular K+ and Cl- activities in human muscle and isolated rat soleus muscle support the view that cromakalim enhances the membrane K+ conductance (gK+).

Although propafenone's beta-blocking actions are readily demonstrable in vitro, clinically significant beta-blockade occurs inconsistently in vivo. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that genetically determined variations in the biotransformation of propafenone to its 5-hydroxy metabolite account for variations in the drug's beta-blocking action. We assessed beta-blockade by measuring the reduction in tachycardia produced by boluses of isoproterenol and treadmill exercise in 14 normal subjects during treatment with placebo and with 150, 225, and 300 mg of propafenone every eight hours for five days each. Nine subjects (with the extensive-metabolizer phenotype) metabolized most of the propafenone to 5-hydroxy propafenone, and five (with the poor-metabolizer phenotype) did not produce this metabolite. At the lower dosages, beta-blockade was present in both groups but was significantly greater in the subjects with poor metabolism, in whom deficient 5-hydroxylation was associated with higher plasma propafenone levels. At the highest dose, a similar degree of beta-blockade was observed in the two groups. Propafenone also had a higher affinity for beta 2 receptors in vitro than either of its major metabolites. We conclude that the degree of beta-blockade during propafenone therapy reflects genetically determined variations in the metabolism of the parent drug, which is necessary for beta-blockade, and that this action of propafenone is considerably enhanced in patients with deficient 5-hydroxylation of propafenone.\r"

We therefore compared the excretion of a thromboxane metabolite and platelet function in 50 patients with Type II diabetes mellitus who had normal renal function and clinical evidence of macrovascular disease and in 32 healthy controls. The mean (+/- SD) excretion rate of urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 was significantly higher in the patients than in the controls (5.94 +/- 3.68 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.79 nmol per day; P less than 0.001), irrespective of the type of macrovascular complication. Tight metabolic control achieved with insulin therapy reduced the levels of 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 by approximately 50 percent. The fractional conversion of exogenous thromboxane B2 (infused at a rate of 4.5, 45.3, or 226.4 fmol per kilogram of body weight per second) to urinary 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 was assessed in four patients, in whom it averaged 5.4 +/- 0.1 percent; this value did not differ from that measured in healthy subjects. Aspirin in low doses (50 mg per day for seven days) reduced urinary excretion of the metabolite by approximately 80 percent in four patients. The fact that thromboxane biosynthesis recovered over the following 10 days was consistent with a platelet origin of the urinary metabolite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90265396\r", 
  ".W": "In Canada in late 1987 there was an outbreak of an acute illness characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms and unusual neurologic abnormalities among persons who had eaten cultivated mussels. Health departments in Canada solicited reports of this newly recognized illness. A case was defined as the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms within 24 hours or of neurologic symptoms within 48 hours of the ingestion of mussels. From the more than 250 reports received, 107 patients met the case definition. The most common symptoms were vomiting (in 76 percent of the patients), abdominal cramps (50 percent), diarrhea (42 percent), headache, often described as incapacitating (43 percent), and loss of short-term memory (25 percent). Nineteen patients were hospitalized, of whom 12 required intensive care because of seizures, coma, profuse respiratory secretions, or unstable blood pressure. Male sex and increasing age were associated independently with the risks of hospitalization and memory loss. Three patients died. Mussels associated with this illness were traced to cultivation beds in three river estuaries on the eastern coast of Prince Edward Island. Domoic acid, which can act as an excitatory neurotransmitter, was identified in mussels left uneaten by the patients and in mussels sampled from these estuaries. The source of the domoic acid appears to have been a form of marine vegetation, Nitzschia pungens, also identified in these waters in late 1987. The contaminated mussels from Prince Edward Island were removed from the market, and no new cases have occurred since December 1987. We conclude that the cause of this outbreak of a novel and severe intoxication was the ingestion of mussels contaminated by domoic acid, a potent excitatory neurotransmitter.\r"

  ".W": "In late 1987 there was an outbreak in Canada of gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms after the consumption of mussels found to be contaminated with domoic acid, which is structurally related to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. We studied the neurologic manifestations in 14 of the more severely affected patients and assessed the neuropathological findings in 4 others who died within four months of ingesting the mussels. In the acute phase of mussel-induced intoxication, the patients had headache, seizures, hemiparesis, ophthalmoplegia, and abnormalities of arousal ranging from agitation to coma. On neuropsychological testing several months later, 12 of the patients had severe anterograde-memory deficits, with relative preservation of other cognitive functions. Eleven patients had clinical and electromyographic evidence of pure motor or sensorimotor neuronopathy or axonopathy. Positron-emission tomography of four patients showed decreased glucose metabolism in the medial temporal lobes. Neuropathological studies in the four patients who died after mussel-induced intoxication demonstrated neuronal necrosis and loss, predominantly in the hippocampus and amygdala, in a pattern similar to that observed experimentally in animals after the administration of kainic acid, which is also structurally similar to glutamate and domoic acid. We conclude that intoxication with domoic acid causes a novel and distinct clinicopathologic syndrome characterized initially by widespread neurologic dysfunction and then by chronic residual memory deficits and motor neuronopathy or axonopathy.\r"

  ".W": "We undertook an observational study of 1307 consecutive surgical procedures at San Francisco General Hospital to record descriptions of intraoperative exposures to blood and other body fluids, determine the factors predictive of these exposures, and identify interventions that might reduce their frequency. During a two-month period, circulating nurses took note of parenteral and cutaneous exposures to blood and recorded information about all procedures. In a follow-up validation study, 50 additional procedures were observed by the study investigators to determine the accuracy of the data collected by the nurses. A total of 960 gloves used by surgical personnel during the validation study were examined to determine the perforation rate. Accidental exposure to blood (parenteral or cutaneous) occurred during 84 procedures (6.4 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5.1 to 7.8 percent). Parenteral exposure occurred in 1.7 percent. The risk of exposure was highest when the procedures lasted more than three hours, when blood loss exceeded 300 ml, and when major vascular and intraabdominal gynecologic surgery was involved. Neither knowledge of diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection nor awareness of a patient's high-risk status for such infection influenced the rate of exposure. Double gloving prevented perforations of the inner glove and cutaneous exposures of the hand. We conclude that all surgical personnel are at risk for intraoperative exposure to blood. Our data support the practice of double gloving and the increased use of water-proof garments and face shields to prevent mucocutaneous exposures to blood. No evidence was found to suggest that preoperative testing for HIV infection would reduce the frequency of accidental exposures to blood.\r"

Of 66 patients followed for more than 1 year (median, 5 years; range, 1 to 26 years), 8/66 patients (12%) had mild improvement and 2/66 (3%) had marked improvement of numbness; no patient had complete return of sensation. The facial numbness was frequently associated with moderate to severe facial pain that was usually resistant to pharmacologic therapy. None of the patients developed clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic vasculitis. The etiology of this cranial sensory neuropathy remains obscure.\r"

  ".W": "Vacuolar degeneration was constantly induced in the CNS of 4-week-old ICR mice by intracerebral or intranasal inoculation of JHM-CC virus, a small plaque mutant of mouse hepatitis virus (JHM). Most animals showed no symptoms or only mild hindlimb paresis. Irrespective of clinical manifestations, the virus was isolated from the CNS up to days 14 to 16. Viral antigen expression in the CNS tissue was most extensive around days 5 to 7 and became undetectable on day 14. Viral antigens were localized almost exclusively to neurons, and the temporal sequence of viral antigen distribution after intranasal inoculation clearly indicated the virus spread through the olfactory and limbic systems into the brainstem and spinal cord, and possible cell-to cell transmission of the virus within the CNS. Vacuolar changes, most conspicuous in the brainstem and spinal cord, were steadily progressive up to 4 weeks after infection, but became indistinct by 4 months. Although the distribution of vacuolar lesions largely agreed with that of viral antigen-positive cells, the severity of vacuolation did not correlate with that of inflammation. Intramyelinic splitting, periaxonal edema, and swollen neurites were major ultrastructural substrates for vacuolar changes. This model could provide a better understanding of new types of neurologic disorders associated with viral infections, including vacuolar myelopathy in AIDS.\r"

The fine-fiber zone is identifiable anatomically as the subcallosal fasciculus. This histologic pattern of subependymal glial accumulations and fine fibers is normal and is often associated with fibrotic small blood vessels. More extensive subcortical MRI changes corresponded, in 1 case, to multiple sclerosis, and in another to subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger's disease) with widespread fiber loss and lacunar changes. Wallerian degeneration secondary to infarction occurred in some areas of MRI abnormality.\r"

Complete recovery of visual function occurred in 65% of cases. Recovery in the majority of patients was rapid and complete within the first 2 months. In some patients, improvement continued over 6 months. The initial classification on the GVIS was significantly correlated with the final outcome. Patients initially classified as having moderate visual impairment recovered completely or improved to near normal vision. Sixty percent of patients initially classified as total or severe blindness had permanent visual impairment. VEP latency remained prolonged in 19 patients, even when their vision had returned to normal, and is a reliable indicator of resolved optic neuritis.\r"
